4,Greate Movie!,I loved this movie it's slow buildingbut towards the end it's greate! Highly recommend it!
3,OK MOVIE,"i rember watching this movie as a little kid with my older brother, i liked it, i mean who doesent like bank robeing movies? Well i guess thats it, if u like this kind of movie go out and get it, because it is a really well done movie, and i think any one would love it, so PEACE OUT, KEEP IT GANSTA."
5,haven't seen menace II society but...,"Ever since I saw this movie I can't stop thinking about it. I missed the begining of it, but I can't wait to see it now. I thoroughly appreciate the soundtrack and the transformation between the times. I thought it was a beautiful film and was very pleased. I wish I hadn't waited so long to see it.After reading all these reviews I would like to rent menace to society."
3,"Gloom, despair, and agony on me!","Aside from the early scenes in 1960s Harlem, this film is unrelentingly grim. You may wanna take some valium after seeing this horror show. Tate goes to Vietnam and (understandably) faces a blood and guts fest that is unsparingly depeicted to the audience. Nothing left to the imagination here, folks. Then he comes home to nothing but gloom, despair, and agony on me of the worst kind ( a pimp supporting his wife, unemployment, shellshocked flashbacks, misguided Black power revolutionaries, a foiled bank robbery, death of friends, being sent to jail, etc. etc). This ain't the Brady Bunch, folks.Of course, few people rent videos to watch such miserable and wretched commentary. If you want to learn about the Vietnam War or it's effect on civilians, check out a documentary."
2,bad quality,"The movie is not in HD, but since I like the movie, I ordered the standard definition. DVD picture quality looks as if it was recorded from vhs."
3,Good but...,"What does this movie have to do with dead presidents? I thought this was about Lincoln, Kennedy, Nixon etc. Addenda: That armored car heist scene is pretty cool.But if you really want to see some racially motivated violence, check out ""Panther""."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,"Simply horrendous. A cheesy, cliched compilation of poorly told stories. The individual bios of the characters are excruciatingly boring. This awful screenplay ends with a long-awaited (and very disappointing) action scene climax (depicted in cover photo). Don't be fooled by the cover. This movie is not about gun fights, action sequences, plot, dialogue, or anything else. Needless to say, the long painful wait was not worth it. This movie absolutely stinks. Consider yourself warned."
1,horrible!,"after watching meanace 2 society, i had big expectations for this movie. i was totally dissapointed. i really don't know what else to say about this movie. the plot wasn't anything great, and the actors did an ok job. but for some reason, the movie just didn't live up to any expectations. i do not recomend this movie to ANYONE. watch meanace 2 society. much better. peace...."
4,Good Film,"This film was really good. By the end of the movie, I did not condone what was done, but I understood. How many of us know people who came back after fighting for their country, and they are working jobs that suck, and living a tough life. That's pretty much the message I got from the film. I watch this movie about once a month, I like it that much. Chris Tucker had a role in this film that makes you stand up and take notice. I would love to see him in more dramas in the future. He could do the roles."
1,Good movie. Cheap DVD.,"CHARADE is an excellent, classic movie and is worthy of a 5 star rating. However, this particular DVD by Front Row Features is not the best. LETTERBOXED EDITION is printed on the case, but the movie is the full screen version. The picture is of poor quality. If your looking for a good DVD of CHARADE, there are better versions around."
4,Cool Movie Deserving of Better DVD,"Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Coburn (and a ""killer"" soundtrack by Henry Mancini) deserve much better treatment than they get in this no-frills DVD with absolutely no special features.This comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest --in spite of a less than admirable film transfer. It's all thanks to the great performances, tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay. Hopefully a better quality and enhanced DVD version will replace this one in your film library. Nonetheless, ""Charade"" remains a charming and timeless classic."
1,Execrable DVD of delightful film,"An extremely inferior transfer to DVD; the picture quality is dreadful, the audio is worse, the ""special features"" are biographies full of sloppy errors (Matthau misspelled, Hepburn's bio under Coburn's link), and the chapter headings give away the mystery. The film itself is still a treat."
2,Quality film poor print,"There's nothing wrong with the plot, the stars of thisamusing thriller. However it's a pity about the print which was used for the transfer, which looks like an old drive-in print which has seen better days."
3,great film with a hiccup,"This is a great classic film, and I would give it a higher rating if if weren't for the bad recording to disc. The picture transfer is great but in two separate places it stops for a second, then jumps a few seconds. If thinking about getting this think again. I have had two copies and both skipped, both were returned to the retailer."
2,Poor video quality and sound,"I have the DVD pictured put out by LaserLight DVD, 2000 Delta Entertainment Corporation. (Cary Grant is pictured on the cover with 4 movie billboards running down the right side, and it says ""You can expect the unexpected when they play). The audio did not match the video; it was out of sync. Nothing was done to restore this movie on this edition."
4,Charade a film worth viewing,"If your fan of Cary Grant & who is not. This is essential to own. This movie is sutle Cary Grant grey haired, yet still handsom. An excellent mystery with strong supporting cast. For the begining movie collector this is a clear choice."
1,Save Your Money,"""Charade"" is one of the most clever and classiest productions ever to come out of Hollywood. Too bad this widescreen transfer is total junk! Absolutely no effort was made to salvage this cinematic gem of the 1960's. The colors are faded, the image fuzzy, the soundtrack appalling. ..."
1,Bad News on this one,"Tried to download this movie. After several hours of internet activity, download stopped, but the unbox player said it was not downloaded. I think this unbox thing is not ready for prime time. I am taking all the unbox stuff off my computer. All this product seems to do is use internet bandwith wintout delivering anything. I'm glad it was free, Goodby unbox!"
3,Restoration for Blu-Ray Lacks Considerably,"Charade is a very entertaining and stylish suspense film with comedy, and the two leads, as many have pointed out, have a lot of star power, charm, and charisma.I've never figured out Criterion's reputation for quality, as the picture quality of every disc of theirs that I've seen completely underwhelms. This Blu-ray image is very dark, flat (no contrast to speak of--even outdoors in broad daylight), grainy, and lacking in crisp detail. Instead of a beautiful high definition picture, the premium price that Criterion always charges only delivers a film that looks like a copy of a copy of a copy that has been syndicated to ones local TV station. You call this a restoration?!If you're a fan of this movie, by all means buy it--just don't expect a beautiful picture to enjoy."
5,Hilarious and Intense! Superb film-making!,"I don't know what I was expecting from this movie. I've liked the lead actors in everything I've seen them in. Until recently I had not even heard of this film.Now I know just how little I know about movies.This one blew my mind. Few movies I've seen have been consistently good every second of the way. This one easily makes that list. The music (!), the colors, the suspense, and yes the acting too - all engrossing. It was intense when it needed to be (Tex and his matches come to mind), funny when it needed to be (and the jokes were actually hilarious!), romantic when necessary.While some of the plot twists were obvious, I don't think that detracted from the suspense. After all, for any movie you've seen more than once (and hence must like?), you already know the plot in advance. This one is definitely rewatchable."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Quality","While Charade is one of my favorite Audrey Hepburn movies, this version is a poor copy to buy. It looks like someone snuck a video camera into the movie theater and put it on DVD. The sound echoes throughout the movie and the film is very, very grainy. If you love Audrey Hepburn, spend a few extra dollars and buy the Criterion Collection."
5,Top ten movie,Fantastic movie and wanted to add it to my collection but was sent a bad copy- disk doesn't work. Returning it for a new one.
1,I second the first review!,"Amazon did indeed refund me for this DVD, but as above, be aware. This DVD is made from the same old lousy public domain print that you see on PBS every few months. This is a great film, and deserves a great copy. I'll be ordering the Criteria version soon (after x-mas shopping), and hope that lives up to expectations. This one doesn't even deserve to be on videotape!"
4,"Good Film, But Beware Poor Quality Versions","""Charade"" is good fun, but buyer beware: the film's copyright was accidentally not renewed, and it has fallen into the public domain. The film has been released by a number of small video companies at a very low price---but you get what you pay for, which is terrible video and audio quality. Given the care that Criterion usually takes with its transfers, ""Charade"" should look great on DVD. But avoid other versions that are not released by a major company."
2,Watch Out!,"This is a WONDERFUL film, but this copy of the print is NOT good, and not worth the savings. Pay a little more if you have to to a distributer who bothered to do a good job."
2,Lousy Print detracts from Great Film,"Too bad the DVD distributor couldn't find a better print of this great film. Spots, scratches, and lines distract the viewer and detract from the over all quality of the viewing experience. If money isn't an object, go for the Criterion version."
5,Charade,"This is a very wonderful movie. Cary Grant is so good doing comedy. Audry Hepburn was such treasure. I very much enjoyed all the cast, The music was superb. And the scenery was out of this world. I highly recommend the film."
5,This Ones Got It All,"There's so much to like about this charming movie it's difficult to begin. First off there's the plot...but it's way too complicated to even start. Next there are the lead characters...however one is never quite who he seems to be, you'll see what I mean. Then there's the cinamatography...Wow!!!...Great location shots of some of the sexyist hot spots in Europe. Of course the musical score is by you know who, (HM)...So you know it's first rate.And if all this were not enough there's Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. These two could light up the screen on a dull grey and dreary day in Hoboken, New Jersey, (it's actually a pretty nice town). So pull up a chair and get ready for one of the sixties very best romatic, suspense, comedies. This one's got it all."
2,Charade,I love this movie but the copy I received was warped or something because the sound kept fading in and out. I was continually increasing and decreasing the sound so we could hear it.I was disappointed with the DVD because of the problem with the sound.
4,The Universal version is a bargain,"My copy of ""Charade"" is on a disc whose main feature is ""The Truth About Charlie,"" a forgettable film based on ""Charade."" I wasn't interested in ""Truth"" and only bought the disc to get a good copy of ""Charade"" at a bargain price.Unlike the remake, ""Charade"" is a tense, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller with two great stars and a superb supporting cast. The pace is exhilarating and the plot is like a roller-coaster ride that often seems out of control."
1,Neither joke nor parody,"76us Charade by Stanley Donen (1963, 113')An old American film directed by Stanley Donen, starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, plus few minors, among which Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy. It spans four genres: suspense thriller, romance, chick flick and comedy. All and none, in a way.As a particlar flair of the US cinema at the time, like Billy Wilder's Irma la douce, same year, it has been filmed in olala Paris, to a Henry Mancini score and theme song. Olala Paris has the sex appeal of Playboy bunnies, equallly forgettable Ersatz.Acting has been better by all, they seem to miss US film canteen culture after work. Except for some rude style of speech and behaviour - a well-known reactive uncertainty of operating in a foreign language environment - Europe seems of little inspiration, and the local US Embassy the only safe haven in such. Silly.76us - 17/5/2012"
4,"Came quickly, Good condition.","Came quickly, Good condition. The sound goes in and out a little bit at 2 spots in the movie. But it is still enjoyable!"
4,CUTE!,"Although the characters do seem to fall in love much too easily in clasic films, I still quite enjoy them. Audrey Hepburn is an actress for the ages, and this time it's no different!"
4,Just saw it and i loved it!,"Done in a Hitchcock style, this thriller/comedy is without a doubt one of the best ""spy"" movies ever. It's a tad long but when you have two great actors (Suave, classy Cary Grant and charming, beautiful Audrey Hepburn) who have real chemistry together you can't help but be into the story. It also is a bit hard to follow and you might have a few questions in the end but you'll still love it."
1,Great Movie But This Is Just A Generic DVD!,"Charade is one of my favorite movies and Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn gave excellent performancaes as did Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy and the Paris location scenes are very good but unfortunately these lower price DVD's have a tendency to have bad picture quality and if you are looking for the best picture possible you will probably want to either buy the pricey Criterion DVD or the Truth About Charlie DVD that includes Charade on the flip side of the DVD as a bonus feature. Both DVD's have beautiful anamorphic widscreen versions of Charade with very good picture quality. I myself can't afford Criterion DVDs which the last time I checked their Charade DVD cost 34 dollars So I bought the cheaper priced Truth About Charlie DVD and I now have a beautiful pristine widescreen transfer of Charade."
5,The only Charade to buy,This DVD has crisp color & glorious sound. Criterion took a great picture and made a superb DVD version of it. The quality is probably better than the original film!
5,What a great movie!,"Although Charade has been criticized as ""Hitchcock lite,"" this film stands on its own. Criterion presents a beautiful transfer of this great flick, featuring Hepburn and Grant, alongside a scene-stealing (and young) Walter Matthau.The only other film I can think to compare this to off the top of my head is North By Northwest (comparison obviously inspired by the Hitchcockian feel and presence of Grant), but don't think of it as derivative. It seems at times that screenwriter Peter Stone was trying to out-Hitchcock Hitchcock with the endless plot twists, but unlike the trend in current cinema, each of the twists seems reasonable and believable. Also, the plot twists add to the story, rather than being conventional sensationalism.In short - a classic film and not to be missed."
5,Am I glad I got this DVD!,"Unlike the majority of customer reviewers, I rarely rate a DVD with 5 stars. This one deserves it for great acting and great attention to detail in both the screenplay and directing. The plot is witty, clever without self-consciousness, and sufficiently interesting for repeat viewings. The Parisian ambiance adds to the film's interest. The special effects are amateurish by today's standards, but I consider plot-for-computer-effects a very good trade. Criterion has done an excellent rescue job, though some deterioration is evident in some of the scenes. Thank you Criterion. The movie is a 5, the DVD a 4."
1,"Don't get me Wrong, GREAT Movie.... but Bad DVD Quality","As I love this movie , I was really disappointed with this DVD: The SOUND is TERRIBLY BAD. I goes up and down, sometimes you can't even ear Cary Grant talking... the sound is even worse than on a VHS.I think the people who released this DVD are just plain idiots and do not care about quality."
2,Lack of Closed Captions ruins this title!,"Sorry charlie, ""English Subtitles"" aren't useful. Closed Captions have been a standard for years for a reason. This titles lacks them on DVD-- while the MCA VHS version has them intact.Criterion has forgotten the most basic home video feature (after picture and sound)."
3,it's worth the money: $3.95,"I though the sound and picture quality were good. It's a basic disc, nothing extra really. Personally, I hate the dialogue."
3,Cary Grant,"Not quite up to the usual movies that Grant starred in, especially those earlier ones directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Audrey Hepburn plays the ""Girl Next Door"" part but lacks the sexy and sophisticated vamp parts played by others such as Ingrid Bergman and Eve Marie Saint.Fun to watch but story a bit predictable."
1,Great movie - TERRIBLE dvd version!,I liked the movie but wanted to add to another post about the DVD quality. I have the same complaint. The DVD issue of this movie is the worst I've ever seen. My DVD issue was by Front Row Entertainment dated 1998.
1,This is the Worst DVD I've Ever Seen,"The film from which this DVD was made looks like a 17th generation 30 year old worn out bootleg exhibition print! The numerous emulsion scratches are extremely distracting; some are so deep they are through the emulsion, into the base stock and show up white! There are color shifts all through the film, sometimes even within a single scene. There are jarring print splices that are incompetently mis-registered! If you single step through you can actually see the cement bubbles!Don't buy this version, don't rent this version, don't even watch this version. If you care anything about the art of cinema or the craft of film, this DVD will make you sick."
1,Frustrating Copy of Fine Film,"To start off, I think Charade is a fine film. I bought this dvd and was so frustrated with it that I gave it away. Every time I hit play I got the trailer. I could not get the movie to play except by going to the scenes and starting at scene 1. If I wanted to see the start, I had to reverse to the beginning. It was very frustrating. While Charade is a great Cary Grant movie. This version of it is not. The Criterion version is the one to have. If you have ever bought any of their dvds, you will understand that they strive to have the best copy of a film available. And they only restore great films which this is one."
4,A classic of a movie; not a perfect picture.,"OK this is a first rate cast with a first rate director, beautifully photographed. Unfortunately the Criterion Blu Ray is noticeably grainy in places. Maybe this is the best print around given the movie's age. The graininess is the only drawback though; other wise I'd give it 5 stars.Audrey Hepburn is at her wide-eyed best up against the always perfect Cary Grant. This movie is FUN to watch - great plot from beginning to surprising ending, great dialogue, good direction and cinematography, and oh yes, toss in the Oscar-winning score by Henry Mancini. If I didn't know better, I'd swear it was a Hitchcock movie - its that good!I was just expecting a perfect 'picture' from Criterion and didn't get it. Blu ray has me spoiled, I guess."
4,One of Cary Grants Best,"I have seen this movie too many times to count. This movie along is non-stop whats going to happen next. The twists and turns in this movie are amazing. Even the resent remake of this movie does not compare with the original in any way shape or form! It is one of my all time favorite movies. If you havent seen this movie, it is a must see! You will not regret it! Charade and House Boat are two of Cary Grants Best Movies that will make you laugh and wonder."
5,Often overlooked !,"Charade is an often overlooked gem of a movie. After all, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn - Guaranteed to keep your attention.Audrey plays a newly widowed woman in the midst of a classic mystery. Cary appears in her life but can't seem to keep his identity straight. Various low lifes also appear and she has no idea why they are after her.Deaths galore and the fabulous scenes of Paris tie it all together. Keeping up with any clues is a challenge. Everyone changes sides at least once and the denouement is a classic. Highly recommended for fans of Audrey, Cary, mysteries, marvelous twists and the City of Light."
3,Beware Of Which Transfer of Charade You Buy,"Charade has seen several different releases on DVD. Most of the releases use inferior masters. The only release that offers a clear picture and sound is the Criterion Collection release. The other releases are budget releases, and while watchable, are vastly inferior to the Criterion release. I do have one of the budget DVD's as the Criterion release is very expensive, and I enjoy the DVD, but I'm saving my pennies for the Criterion release for this one, or if the Criterion transfer is made available at a more reasonable price. Charade is a classic thriller/mystery with comedic touches that will leave you guesing to the end. Mancini's score is fantastic, and the chemistry between Grant and Hepburn is electric.This is one of Grant's finest on-screen moments. 5 stars for the movie and 2 stars for the budget transfer equal a total rating of 3.5."
2,Bad transfer,"Don't buy this version of the movie. It looks like it was directly transferred from VHS. The box says it is ""widescreen"". It is NOT true widescreen. The transfer looks very bad. The quality of this is horrible for both the audio and video aspects. I would recommend purchasing the Criterion version or the other DVD release.Movie-wise it was okay. There is definately some on-screen chemistry with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, but the story is a little kooky. Not the best movie vehicle for both stars involved. A rental at best, if interested."
2,"""Charade"" didn't keep my interest","Despite having a talented and wonderful cast, I didn't enjoy this movie. The costumes, scenery, and acting were wonderful. But I didn't care much for the plot."
3,Good mystery--stiff romance,"The mystery in this movie is great...dark characters, and questions at every turn, along with a great ending! However, I did not find the romance between Hepburn and Grant believable. Their relationship seems forced, with the Hepburn character to bright to fall for the lame explanations that she is given by Grant's character.I would have appreciated a less definitive ending with respect to their relationship, which would have been fine given how the mystery aspect of the story comes to a close."
2,Wasted Your Money,It was a waste of my money; the movie will not play on my DVD player. But it will play on someone else's.
2,How could it be so wrong???,"I would not have thought it possible for either Grant or Hepburn to be dull, but after an hour of Charade, I've reconsidered. For those who remember this film fondly, it's time to watch it again. While both actors are easy on the eyes, they can't combat the terrible script and its stilted dialogue. Both Grant and Hepburn seem embarassed by their dialogue.Charade does manage some visual style (difficult to imagine a Hepburn film without it), but borrows heavily from other films and never finds a consistent tone, giving it a strange and unwieldy effect. Directors Stanley Donen and Alfred Ziesler adopt a Hitchcock intro and theme (watch the neo-James Bond credits), but fail to deliver on the goods. Walter Matthua, as Hepburn's U.S. government contact is the only player showing some spark.I would only recommend Charade to seriously hard-hardcore Grant and Hepburn fans. If you insist on watching, wait until you've had your second glass of wine."
1,Lies of advertising the movie,"I could not watch the movie, because I never got it. After several weeks I sent and email to to seller asking about the status and the answer was ""sorry, this product is not available""I did not receive a reimburse in my credit card. Why do the seller advertising something is not available?When am I going to have my money back? What a dissapointment!!!! :-("
1,Prime Video Version Unwatchable!,"This is a great movie. Too bad Amazon is providing an incredibly awful transfer of it as its Amazon Prime version. Truly,truly misguided decision."
1,Badly produced DVD,"I received this particular DVD yesterday; I don't hold the seller responsible for this as they were selling what they had. BUT, don't buy this item if you are looking for a good quality (or even passable quality) movie. This has to have been a copy straight from celluloid to DVD with all scratches, burns and flaws included (the sound track was even out of sync with the picture at times)."
4,Spend wisely.,"Plenty of other reviewers can tell you about the artistic qualities of this movie. What I can tell you is that if you want this movie this is the edition you want.There are cheaper versions but that's what they are, this criterion edition cost a premium but provides the picture quality you expect from a DVD."
2,"Movie -10, Version - 2","Mine was a case of impulse purchase. I saw the Charade cover with Cary Grant and Audrey H and knew I had to have it in my collection. And a price of under $9.00! The movie arrived I popped it in and to my sadness, the print is so grainy it's not enjoyable at all. Of course, after only a few minutes back on Amazon, I discovered that there is a new transfer from Criterion and as those reviewers write the transfer is gorgeous. This is one movie I will buy twice to have a version worth keeping. They say when you buy expensive, you only cry once. :-)Take your time to choose the version and release you really desire. Other than that great film, great lead actors."
1,BEWARE THIS IS THE AWFUL COPY!,"Beware, this is the awful copy of this great movie. and some bearing this cover are actually in black and white!Amazon, this is a rip off. drop it."
5,Superb Grant-Hepburn movie,"I have seen this movie many, many times. Grant and Hepburn are wonderful together - such chemistry! They really should have made more films together. I have not seen any of the DVD versions. I would like to buy one, but there are so many bad comments about the picture quality. Do all 3 DVD versions have the same bad picture quality or just one of them? Thank you for any help you may give me on this."
4,Mystery and Humor,"A film classic. Blends wit, humor, and mystery. The twists and turns of the characters' identities keeps you guessing to the very end. A fun thriller."
4,Charade,"This movie is so great, I would reccomend it for those who love the classics. It arrived quickly and not damaged."
5,My Favorite Bruckner Sixth,"While going through a period of trying out a number of Bruckner Sixth's, and not being satisfied, I tuned the car radio to the classical station one night and caught the final movement of this recording. It was so gripping I had to stay sitting in the parked car until it was over to find out who the conductor was.I went out and bought it and have never looked back, even though, strictly speaking the recording job, (or at any rate the remastering), could be a little better. It starts off more slowly than most performances of this work, but somehow, that allows the momentum to build inexorably. Certain passages are more beautiful and expansive than I have ever heard them without ever getting sentimental or mushy sounding. By the end I am always amazed. A real keeper!"
5,Ben Hamper has hit it right on the rivet!,"Having survived working the assembly line for five years('97 to '02), I can tell you it hasn't changed much since Hamper's early retirement. I could identify with so much that Ben had to write about in this book, except we didn't have our own Howie Makem. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. For those who work on the line, I definately would suggest reading this book!"
5,Wouldn't you like to be a factory rat too?,"Rivethead is probably in the top five books I've ever read. In a previous review I saw that a history professor assigned it; I find that fascinating. I have been a history major and let me tell you, I found very few historians that are in touch enough to assign such an in-touch book as Mr. Hamper's (closest I can remember was ""One Day in the life of Ivan Denosovich""). I check this page every few months to find out if Ben has anything else out, but no luck just yet. For those who are curious, I saw some where, five or six years ago, he was writing a book on The Mall of America. While you are waiting I would recommend ""Bound For Glory"" by Woody Guthrie.."
3,I have my own tales from an Assembly Line,"I didn't really like reading this book because I too work in a (once) major three Auto plant. I didn't feel that it properly portrayed some of the workers. It made it sound like all workers are like the author where they just really don't give a damn about anything except having a joking time on the job. It also made the workers sound like they were underachieving, undereducated, bottom of the barrel workers and I didn't care to have that stigma for all of us. I hold two bachelor degrees, like my job and take it serious!"
5,You Are What You Do,"Its not often that I read a book that consistently makes me laugh out loud, but Hamper was able to do so for me with every passing page in Rivethead. I read it for a class assignment, but have re-read it since then, and have also recommended it to others. Its a first-hand account of how one man took the default path in life and followed in his father's footsteps, joining the GM assembly line. Hamper goes through how he came to this profession, and the steps in his life that 'messed up' his aspirations of breaking away from such a path. But more than that, it shows how in American society, we are defined by what we do from 9-5 rather than who we are in our time off work. Hamper subscribes to this belief as a columnist while working on the assemblyline, and although we may not realize it, we may also subscribe to such a belief. Ultimately, the daily grind ends up consuming Hamper, and he is forced to take time away from 'work' and recognize the part of him that exists off the job."
3,Rivethead,"Vulgar exaggeration that is just outright fun to read is the best way to describe this book. Ben Hamper's autobiography, Rivethead, is a simple story of life on the American car manufacturing line in the 1980's. Assuming only half the stories are true, it's no wonder that the Japanese beat the American's in the auto industry.Where Rivethead falls short is that it glamorizes the destructive behavior or drugs and alcohol, especially while working on an assembly line. Hamper's amazingly funny stories about the blue collar worker keeps the book enjoyable. But at the same time, the underlying social norms of mediocracy and work avoidance with the before mentioned substance abuses is disheartening at best. In the end, Hamper never grows beyond these poor behaviors and seems to to relish the life of an alcoholic union worker.Overall, it's a fun book that leaves the moralistic reader seeking more."
4,Survival of the Fittest,"Growing up in Detroit, I knew a lot of shop rats who either worked in the factories for the Big(at the time)Four, or slaved away in smaller shops that served these smokestack whorehouses. Hamper painfully describes the life of a shop rat through his own miserable experience. The misery these men dished out to themselves and each other in an attempt to survive a culture of human desecration is exactly what I watched in Detroit as young men I graduated from high school with, discintegrated around me.Perhaps that explains to some extent my own extensive drug and alcohol exploration when I went to college to escape the factories of Detroit. If you want to read a story with a similar feel, try Troutman Penthouse 1975.Bob Wayne, author"
4,"""Rivethead"" describes life on the GM assembly line.","Ben Hamper's outrageous description of life on thecar and truck assembly line had me laughing out loud at the antics of both workers and bosses at the GM factory in Flint, Michigan. Hamper uses words like rivets and blasts them at the nearest human target; no one escapes his savage attack, not even himself. Hamper is a ""flake"" and he knows it, but he is an observant flake who is just as adept at turning a phrase as he is finding ways to avoid work. He seeks to please no one, not even himself, and he succeeds beyond even his expectations. Read at your own risk is how Hamper himself might caution us about ""Rivethead."""
4,"awesome looking, but caution buying","Awesome looking product, looks like real books. But the engineering design is dumbfounding. Why built a product for only a specific speaker. And i did a search and cant find where the speaker is sold anymore. But i did find a solution: take a jig saw and cut the bottom where it curves and make it straight. Then a small satellite speaker can fit in it. I purchased the Acoustic Research MC2.5W (2.5"" mini speaker) and it fits in it (barely). I think 2.5"" is the largest that would fit."
4,Lakme,"Delibes - Lakmé / Mesplé, Burles, Soyer, Millet, Opéra-Comique, Lombard [highlights]A very popular opera and one of my favorites. The music in this opera is used in many, many ads on TV, especially by 'British Airways' (You've heard it but you won't recognize it until you've listened to the music). And Yani has a wonderful rendition on one of his CDs which will make your eyes water with emotion."
1,FRUSTRATION,"As a user of WEBTV, I keep getting the interrupt of Publisher is very busy so you are unable to hear the music. So what gives Amazonia?"
5,Flower Duet! (track 2),"Like most people that don't have much opera background, I was steered to buying this for the ""Flower Duet"" track (#2).I recommend reading about the play on any website that describes the story. It gave me more appreciation for the CD since I understood what all the singing was about..haIts a wonderful story, read it, listen and enjoy."
1,not what I ordered,I was trying to buy blank checks but only got a few pages of blank checks. What I apparently paid for was a CD-Rom which I didn't need and was completely useless to me. I feel that what was promised and what I got was completely different. This was a complete waste of money.
5,A deeply moving film worth watching.,"I really enjoyed watching this particular film because it deals with intense religious conflicts challenging a small, rural Christian community. The director successfully captures the serene landscape including, forests, rivers, and the fields of rural Sweden as well as the crowded, ancient splendor of Jerusalem. It's definately a long, complex plot worth watching for those who enjoy thinking when watching a film!"
4,"Jerusalem (1996, Swedish with English sub-titles) Insightful","This movie has the aura of an Ingmar Bergman production, with a series of twists and turns in the plot - along with thought-provoking motifs reminiscent of an ancient Greek tragedy. Is there any coincidence that the protagonist's name happens to be Ingmar Ingmarsson? It is based on a novel by Selma Lagelof, and portrays Swedish village life around the turn of the 20th century.Christian viewers of this movie will likely be interested in the themes of: mainline versus apocalyptic-sectarian faith, the destructive potential of authority and power, discerning the truth, suffering and sacrifice, love, forgiveness, reconciliation and hope.I highly recommend Jerusalem because of the theological grist for the mill that it provides. In fact, it has inspired my interest in Lagerlof's novel."
4,Excellent!,"For anyone who has experienced a church dominated by one minister or the isolation of dissenting with a religious group, see this movie! The emotions and events are most realistic."
2,Lacks Substance,"I watched this film hoping the true story of the Overcomers would be told. I was very disappointed. If you are viewing this film to learn more about this particular cult you will not find information here. The story itself is very slow to develop, and resembles Titantic to the same degree the Titantic was really about a fictional love story, as opposed to the sinking of vast vessel."
4,Wide-ranging,"This is the book I use for my beginning guitar class - not because it is the best instruction book out there, necessarily, but because it introduces a wide variety of styles and the CDs support the student's continued learning after the class ends."
1,Are you goofy?!?!,"Or have they corrected this book recently?First off, I am a pianist AND guitarist with over 30 years of experiance. I was looking for a book that would be a good starter for my girlfriend's son...I am NOT buying this book at this time, but I looked at the ""see inside"" link. Take a CLOSE look to page 12, see anything amiss?Everything is transposed 1 OCTAVE higher than what it SHOULD be!If something as simple and basic as that is wrong... what else did they miss?I would keep an eye out for this book in stores and see if they have revised it before I were to buy it here."
2,meh...,"Much like the movie, playing it a second time after many years, this soundtrack also felt dated. Also the French song from the movie that could be heard from the headphones of the milkman assassin isn't included! What gives?!"
5,Basic Neuropathy Guide,"This is great at explaining the basics of Neuropathy. It is a must if you have just been diagnosed. It explains terms, what happens in neuropathy, and the various types. It is written so everyone can understand it. Fast reading."
2,Item did not come as pictured,"The wristbands are fine as far as quality, but they did not come as described. They are shown with the emblem, the ""M"", but came with the word Mizuno written out and a different, triangular symbol on it. So you really don't know what you are getting. Much more branded looking and not what I wanted. Two starts because functionality is fine."
1,Too small,"Unless you have wrists like a small child, these are crap. I would not recommend these to friends. TOO SMALL!"
5,Mizuno Wristbands,"Like most people, I wanted these to wear high on my forearm near the elbow during ball games. These are perfect for that purpose as well as for using them for their original purpose: wristbands/sweatbands. These are the normal style wristbands and they are very soft. The only thing wrong with the product description is that the ""M"" logo is not on these; instead (better yet) they have the modern Runbird logo that is on all of Mizuno's products. Regardless, great bands for utility purpose or fashion accessory."
4,Active boys need this!,My grandson is 6 years old and is very active. He loves sports of every kind and is an outside kid who runs and plays constantly which means he sweats a lot. These wristbands are great for wiping his forehead and can go right into the wash so they're ready for the next day.
3,"Good, but....","It's obviously a product that isn't up to the real canon standards. The ink and presentation is fine in black, but it smears when you highlight anything. Meaning my highlighter is ruined and I've got black ink running across the page. When printing there are signs of wispy ink traces too. It's a fine product for basic page printing. Nothing wrong with it. But if you're doing resume building, or need something for a presentation, I'd say go with the real canon ink, and not this brand. For as cheap as it is, it's great for the basics.The color tends to smear and be really grainy, especially on regular paper."
2,"Low price, low quality","I just plugged it in and I cannot get it to print blue color correctly. As far as I can tell CYAN is way too green and the tone is changing as you print. Ridiculous. It is OK for draft quality prints, but not for anything else."
5,Works fine for me,"I have ordered 2 sets for these cartridges and all have worked just fine, and I love the price. Seem to last just as long as the name brand that I was paying through the nose for!"
3,"Black cartridges are good, color cartridges are crap","As with mot knock-off brands, the black ink is fine, but the color ink seems like it's been diluted 50-50 with water. I would certainly purchase the black ones again, but not the color ones. I tried deep cleaning the print heads over and over and printing full sheets of solid primary color, but they always came out totally washed out looking. When I put a Canon cartridge in, I get fantastic color, so I am sure it's just the quality of the ink in these cartridges."
2,Be careful!,"I was so hyped that it SAID it would work for a Canon Pixima ip1500 printer. Then I clicked on the tab (will this work for my printer). It will NOT! Its false advertising! Why include in the description my printer model if it doesn't work for it? Made me mad! So, anyways just be careful and use that tab to make sure before you purchase it!"
2,What ink?,"Although you get multiple color and black cartridges that are *sealed*, color cartridges are practically empty, making them completely useless.I am giving it two stars only because the price was *cheap* and the black is working good enough.Color is complete crap! All cartridges were bad.Used for my daughter's printer who had not used it since I bought the ink. I thought perhaps the printer needed cleaning, so ran multiple clean cycles and got the same. Figured the cartridge dried out, so I replaced with another. Exact same issue.The *bargain* was now a big waste of money.Get what you pay for, I guess."
2,"Decent, but you get what you pay for","These worked great for the first 10 pages or so. I was converted, but only for a short time. The print quality deteriorated rather quickly. The cartridge lasted about 30 pages, and then it was done. Yes, it worked, but not well and not for long."
2,You get what you pay for,"Not swell, under filled or empty. If you cant count on them it doesn't matter if their free..Will pay more and get the OE replacements.."
2,Not all are good in quality of these ink cartridge,"I bought a package of 3 black and 3 color cartridges. The first black one doesn't print fully, the 2nd one is ok. It seems not all the ones are fully loaded."
4,"Good, so far","They came in different, blue package, and for a moment I was afraid that someone mixed up an order. But they fit and work fine. So far had a chance to use some black ink, don`t know about color jet. Black print looks fine, no different than original Canon ink. Well, for less then $6 with shipping it looks like great deal, hope that all cartridges are as good, as the first one. Oh, and my printer is i250, kind of basic, few years old model. Hope it helps."
1,Not worth the Money even at the Cheap Price,Went through two black and one color cartridges over one sitting trying to print a few pages. Third black went out after < 5 pages. Save your money and either try another off brand or go Canon OEM cartridge.
1,dissapointed,these cartridges did not work well with my Canon printer. After a few pages of print they just stop working. I dont recommend this item.
5,Great CD ata Great Price,"This is an awesome little disk. The pairing of tracks for the frontmen of Death Cab for Cutie and American Analogue Set goes very well together. Gibbard tracks are permanently in my head in a good way, and Kenny's are equally brilliant. This is the 5th in the split CD series from Post-Parlo Records, and if you are an indy fan you should know this label. Great stuff!"
1,don't be fooled by the title,this 3 CD set has nothing to do with Best of Buddha Beats. The amazon title doesn't even match what's on the CD cover. The songs sucks compared to the real best of Buddha beats compilations. This is a knock off.
4,Good Work or a Ramble?,"This book focuses on the Pirates of the Caribbean during the near 50 year time span that made up the ""Golden Age of Piracy"". The content of the book is good, goes into detail, yet a tad too much. The Structure of the book is well done, but the chapters are something else. A topic will be introduced, talked about and then he will go on to ramble about this and that and then before the end of the chapter he returns to the original topic and then concludes it. Despite this, it is a well written book, but if your looking for ""perfect"" this isn't for you.Though the content seems to come from men like Daniel Defoe, he does have at least one aspect of his book that is original unlike past Pirate books I've read, where he goes on to talk about HOW the Piracy issue was solved, such as David Porter, father of the US Civil War Admiral David Porter, pretty much crushed the Pirates operating along the US coastal lines and the Caribbean."
5,Naked Capitalist,People need to wake up to the state America is in!!! Reading this book will enlighten one greatly. The progress of the far left is very evident. And you only need to read this book to see.
3,Naked Capitalist,The information is useful however the format and typeface is very off putting. It gives one the impression that this is a self publication done by grammar school kids.
5,Very practical information & an entertaining read,"Excellent book. Very useful information on every page. Other books on the same topic do not get down to the ""nitty-gritty"" as this book does. The author shares invaluable personal information. It's like having a friend offer advice and support. Very helpful resource list in the back. Also has a good index. Perfect for lesbians trying to become pregnant, but not knowing where or how to begin."
5,A Great Book,"For my partner and I who are still in the thinking and planning stages of family making, this book was really helpful and gave insight to some of the things we can expect! I would highly recommend it to anyone even THINKING about starting a family."
1,Very hard to play on,"It's hard to tell from the picture, but the marbles aren't solid colors. Instead, they're clear with a wavy piece of color running through them. That makes it very hard to see the color against the various parts of the Chinese Checkers board. Also, the spots for the board are very shallow, so any bump of the board will send the pieces rolling into new spots.The checkers board is strangely colored and hard on the eyes. The pieces also feel extremely cheap, making it much less pleasant to play on than a separate checkers set you can buy for a few bucks."
1,don't bother,"I bought this item thinking that the storage tin with the built-in playing board was a great feature. I ended up returning it for a refund because the holes aren't deep enough for the marbles to be properly seated, so any slight knock of the board causes all marbles to fall off of their divots. In addition, the holes are so close together that adult hands must move very gingerly in order to avoid knocking a nearby marble out of its place when moving another."
1,Junky,"Pieces were tiny and junky. We couldn't tell the chess pieces apart from each other. The balls for the Chinese Checkers were so light, feather weight plastic. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,abc,"The tin box does NOT close good, so you might want to keep the bottom cardboard part to keep the tin box close."
1,Lousy product - AVOID,"We bought this at target for $5 and we took it back. The chess pieces are microscopic and are painful on your eyes to distinguish from a standard playing eye to hand distance. The rest would be okay for the price, but extremely low quality. Avoid this set."
3,Okay but lasted less than 4 months,"Length:: 1:14 MinsThis product is probably worth less than $20. I bought it last November and it held up through most of February fairly well. But in the last month or so, it seems like it really fell apart. (The cat hasn't been using in recent months anymore than when I first bought it.) The video shows the condition of the post as it is today. It's probably a decent buy, but if you purchase it do expect to replace it within a year."
4,Great Price well made,Wood backing and nice size. My kitties love it! It was priced well under what I would pay at a pet store so I'm not too worried if they destroy it.
5,Great,I recieved this product fast within few days and My cat really likes it and stop using the furniture and what not.
1,Ignores it.,"I have tried everything to get my cat to use it. I have sprayed catnip on it. My cat perches on the top of it. She doesn't use it as a scratching post. It's a good product, but my cat doesn't know what to do with it."
5,marvelous!,This DVD works best for people like me. I'm the kind of person who works from morn till dawn and hardly get the time for anything even shopping now that's sad!My friend gave me this DVD on my birthday and ever since then I've been listening to only Latin songs and dancing whenever possible even at work when I feel like nobody's watching me! This DVD has a great impact on me. I'm a true and loyal `LATINO' fan now. I recommend this DVD to everyone. You're not gona regret but I reckon you will if you don't grab a copy for yourself today!
5,Unique Patterns,I bought the first intermediate DVD and this one at the same time. My goal was to learn some new combinations to help keep my moves fresh on the dance floor. I got exactly what I wanted.
4,Passion Emotion and Raw Talent,A CD well worth owning if you are a fan of the cello. Miss Dupre played with such emotion and character that it is as if she is having a dialog with you the listener. A wonderful compendium of early recordings that demonstrate her talent from all aspects. These are what introduced her to the world. They are well worth listening to and haveing.
2,An author has recommended me to read this book.,"I haven't read this book. That is why I want to buy it. I come to know about this book when I read Dale Carneige's book and he suggest me to get this book and read. So recommended by him, i think I can give this book two star.Thank you."
5,Very good book,Motorized Mail: Postal Vehicles from 1899 to date by James H. Bruns is a great book. I highly recommend it. Money well spent.
2,Didn't capture my son's interest for long,"My son loves soccer. And he is 6 so he thought the cover art was hilarious. He couldn't wait to see this movie. But he lost interest in it fairly early on. There wasn't enough humor or soccer to keep him interested. As a reference point, he loved the movie Mighty Ducks (and it's about hockey, which he doesn't have any connection to)."
2,Predictable,"Just like all the other Disney sports movies [Little Giants, Angels In The Outfield, Little Big League] only it was more boring. Not a very good movie."
5,Good Movie!,The Reason I am rating this five stars because it's a excellent movie and plus it talks about how Anna Montgomery's Class made a team and everything.
1,Waste of my money,DVD did not work and was a gift to someone out of state therefore was never able to return it.
1,Not a good movie for boys,"While looking for a movie that would have good role models for boys, I had high hopes for this one, but it's typically Disney. The stupid, petty, and poor players are boys, and the smart, ""good"", and athletic players are girls.This is not a good movie if you looking for role models to be examples for young boys"
3,a so-so movie,"It was funny and a overall good movie, but it was really not that good. It was just a avrege movie. But its a good overall rainy day movie. Or a lazy day movie."
3,"Tool 5, Milwaukee 0","This is a great tool /battery combo AS LONG AS YOU DON""T NEED MORE BATTERIES!!! Milwaukee had the V18 batts for $51.00 each, a fair price. BUT lateley the have raised their price to OVER $100 each!!! Just another way Milwaukee screws their loyal customers. I would recomend you buy the DeWalt 18v XPR set instead. And oh by the way, the NEW 18 Volt smaller Lith/Ion batt. WILL NOT FIT THIS TOOL!!!!!!"
4,blink 182 does it again!,yes blink 182 does it again. another great album! its alot different then thier past albums but i like the change. its slower and more mello and doesnt have any joke songs. the songs are all serious and really great. the lyrics are good and meaningful. the vocals are fabulous. the music has lots of instuments and different guitar sounds which is really great. i would reccomend this CD to anyone. go buy it!
5,TWO thumbs UP!,"Let me guess, when you hear of blink 182, you think of the potty-mouth, imature, (though sometimes funny) guys. If you have listened to one of their past albums you would know that they always have some jokes about something profane!But this CD. greatly differs. It not only shows a more serious side of blink 182, but it exhibits music in great versitality. So many FX. and different beats, and different pitches are used (in a good way). Many albums sound have a hit song or two, but then the rest of the tracks, well, suck! But this self-titled album is full of great tunes.This CD.,if not their best, shows guitar at it's highest, drums at it's highest, and bass at it's highest. With great lyrics, great tunes, and amazingly talented musicians, you can't go wrong if you buy this album.In a nutshell, buy this CD. It has many different genres, and sounds fresh. You won't get tired of the tunes, and you can dance to them ALL NIGHT!"
4,New Direction,"Whoever will by this cd, you will be surprised. Blin k182 really goes into a new direction, with their music and their lyrics. I would say it is a good album, but if you really liked the last few like ""dude ranch"" or ""take off your pants and jacket"", you will be disapointed. And beaware if you have a discplayer that plays mp3 CDs. You might have problems playing this cd. You also won't be able to play the songs on your PC although you can watch the bonus material."
4,Awesome,"I love the new Blink CD. I wasn't a big fan of the third and fourth releases (The Tom, Mark, and Travis Show or Take Off Your Pants and Jacket) because, well, I wasn't into the immature nature of the lyrics, but I have to say, the new CD kicks butt."
5,BLINK ROCK!!,Blinks new album is pure genius although i still love the old stuff. Im listenin to it now for about the 50000000000000000000000th time since i got it. Fave song Violence!!!LatersLee
5,Blinks awesome CD,"I was kinda worried when I heard that Blink 182 was going with a new sounds but I fell in love with them all over again when I heard the new CD!! Each song is very emotional and deep that I can't help but listen to it again and again!! It is the best cd i have bought since there last cd!! ""I miss you"" is my favorite song because it has this amazing beat!"
5,unbelievable,well after take off your pants and jacket i wasnt sure what was next from blink. and then box car and the transplants formed and i was a little scared of what was to become of blink. but they're back and totally in action. !!!!which is GREAT!!!! the music is great and the lyrics suit them..(mostly...**c'mon this is blink 182**) but the songs straight out ROCK!! i give this a monstrous 10 thumbs up!!!!
4,Give this a try,"Dont Get Me Wrong, I am massive fan of Blink's older stuff, I will never get sick of mom jokes, But this new stuff is a beginning of a new era. Yeah, it is a little more box car racer than we all thought but theres no doubt that this album gets better everytime you listen to it. It may be far from what you expect but it wont hurt to give it a try...you never know, you might just love it."
5,All that time off was worth it,I have bought everyone one of Blink 182's cds and by far this is one of the best of their past 3 that they have made. All that time off was worth it!
5,Deffinately worth every cent,"This CD is the best CD I've ever spent money on. If you enjoy Blink182, this is an amazing CD. If you don't own a Blink182 CD or have never heard of them, this is the CD to start with. It's a totally new and mature sound for Blink, not all about highschool break-ups and things of that sort. This CD actually has meaning... mixed with some amazing guitar riffs and ofcourse, Travis' drumming skills. (Which are the best there are). I promise, you won't regret buying this CD. (My mom even likes it!)"
5,You know what? This is damn good,"Finally! A Mainstream band willing to put it on the line and go for broke. Other than Green Day, no one has really done it.And you know what? It's good too. Caution: This is not the Blink182 you've known for the past 10 years, but its definitely worth a listen. Songs like ""Violence"", ""Stockholm Syndrome"" and ""Down"" all rank among Blink's best. ""Go"" is also a short fast burst in an otherwise more subdued setting. But the capper, in my opinion is ""I'm Lost Without You"". A slow, quiet, piano-driven song, one of Blink's best yet.Is this better than Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat? Probably not.Is this a good CD? Yes, it is. And if you like Blink, this one belongs in your collection."
4,Cool stuff,"To put it simple, this cd is actually WORTH buying. Its kinda like blink 182's music has matured a bit, and because of this I think they have put out one of their best CDs so far. Its like a old friend who you use to play outside with, now 10 years later she wants to play in the bedroom....Highlights include: Violence, Feeling This, I Miss You, and Always."
2,Blink182,"Blink182's late 2003 release, which was known to be Untitled, was hyped up to be the new Blink 182. This revamped version of the pop-punk band turned out to be very disapointing. The lyrics are changed, but overall, the songs arent very amusing. Blink182 were known for being walking hard-ons. They made people laugh with there music, which was a rare trait to have. This ""new"" blink182 changed thier lyrics to be more ""mature"", and wanted to make the songs more full, by dubbing in 3 or 4 guitars at a time, as well as harmonizing with thier own voices(which last time I checked, is impossible to do). Overall, this CD was nothing amazing. Sure it had some catchy songs, but overall it was dissapointing. Nowhere near as good as thier previous releases."
5,I'm GIDDY!!!!,"This is a great album for anyone who has ever liked anything from Blink. I ordered this album and the new album from THE HIPPOS online and when they were delivered, it was the greatest day of the year. First, I got The Hippos album, which brought me great joy (it's a good album and I recommend it highly). THEN, I started listening to the Blink album and I had the biggest smile on my face. This album is so cool and different, but different in the best possible way. These guys are great musicians. Every song on here is a masterpiece. GO get this album from Blink (and THe Hippos self-titled album if you have time). It's WELL WORTH IT!"
1,"Wow, I remember when Blink was good...","Now, maybe I've heard enough of this Emo/slow punk crap where I just don't care about it anymore, Blink USED TO BE PUNK!Now, I'm not some random guy who started listening to Blink 182 when they were popular (for the old fans to yell at), and I'm not *that guy* who was at their first show and never want them to change (for the new fans to yell at). But, well, Blink 182's CDs were the ones I would stick in the CD player and play when I needed some energy, because it oozed out of their music.I think ""Dude Ranch"" and ""Enema of the State"" were their best albums, and I've been a Blink fan since Cheshire Cat. I'm listening to this album right now, and all I think is something I should be listening to when I'm depressed when I get dumped by my girlfriend and get kicked out of the house and my car breaks down and my dog dies... you get the picture.Ahhh, I remember that Punk Music thing..."
1,um..,"i like blink 182 very much. i have some of their other cds like enema, and take off your pants, etc. i like the way they were immature and ""punk"". this cd...OH NO. NO NO NO. terrible. are they trying to be depressing and emo? their lyrics arent even sentimental or thought provoking: they suck. they are trying to immitate what many other bands can do better. when i first heard that blink was releasing a new album, i was stoaked. i purchased it and listened to it but i just cant seem to like it. #1 is alright, but then #5...what the hell? she is like talking for a half an hour...i want to hear some music, not listen to someone that sounds like nicole kidman read a love sonnet about WWII for an hour. dont buy this cd. if you are really insistant, download it."
3,Not that good.,"This album is just not that good if you are into good old punk rock. And for the guy below, there is a difference between ""being punk"" and ""punk rock"". I can name a lot a bands that have never changed their style from the basic punk rock style and continue(d) to make new and really good albums. And guess what, I am older and married and still listen almost only to fast 4 chord punk friggin' rock! What's wrong with listening to a band (like Blink) and being disappointed they felt the need to change? Now, taken for what it is, this CD is ok. If it tanks, I would expect a fast release of a punk rock album to get the fans back the way Face to Face did."
3,Deceptive,"Blink is trying again to fool us, this album is such a trick. Even with the good effort of putting beatbox and other electronic effects it's still blink 182 a pop punk rock band from california. If you really do appreciate blink 182 you'll love to discover the evolution of the band even if this evolution looks more symbolic. quickly: fun, easy,and will probably pull the tears out from the 14 years old ladies."
3,Go Back To Your Old Stuff,"Well the long awaited Blink album has disappointed many people including myself.Whatever happened to the good old days where their music was fun and not so boring?????Dont get me wrong,i like a few of the songs on the album but as i said, some of their songs are BORING.kEEP YOUR HEADS UP BLINK............."
1,This what happens when it takes a year to record,"I consider myself a die hard Blink fan, but this album was pretty bad. All the other Blink albums took 2 weeks to record, this one a year. This one is nothing like the sound they invented. Hopefully, they'll play what comes natural, and record a good CD. Another one like this, and Mark and Tom will serving fast food for a living!!"
2,Maturity doesn't equal good music,"OK first off I'd like to say that all you fools praising this CD cuz blink 182 ""finally grew up"" are idiots. Alternative music is not about being mature. It's about energy, angst, and fun. This CD has very little energy, its more about crying then angst, and its rarely fun. Although I do like ""Feelin This"" and ""Miss You"", most of the songs are plain crappy. A few other songs have some merit but in total theres 5 songs even worth considering listening to. If you're looking for a GOOD blink 182 CD, definitely buy ""Dude Ranch"". It is infinitely better than this one and every song is good. ""Dammit"" is their best song and they will likely never top it. They should have remembered that that was growing up. Not the garbage you can find on this CD."
5,Blink 182 Rocks!!!!!!!!!!,there is no cd better than this althogh all the other blink182 cds tie with it. all the songs were really good PUNK ROCK. (not pop!!!!) i love this cd. blink 182 is the best. make sure you buy this cd. you don't know what your missin'
5,.... man didnt they screw up?!?,"ok i dont understand... this is an awesome cd... blink has finally matured and showed everyone that with there minds maturing... there music did also... all of you people are sayin that you are true blink fans!?! have you ever herd the song dancin with myself? does my breath smell? these people are great for there old immature songs... but they are evn greater for the ""mature"" songs..."
5,this is album is the best,this is blink's best album ever. it's so awesome how they can write about real stuff now. every song on this album is so good! i cant even choose between them! keep rockin blink! see ya at the show
3,um...they've done much better.,"i've absolutely loved blink 182 since i was like 10. But this album wasn't thier best work. It doesn't even come close to ""enema of the state"" or ""cheshire cat"" or even ""...pants and jacket"". The songs are too short,the styles don't vary, they've lost thier crazy edge and frankly, i think its boring. I bought it and listen to it out of loyalty and hope that they will return to thier original greatness."
5,Watch out....,I was so excited for this CD to come out because I heard that it would be different from all their other stuff...but also a bit nervous. Anyways I listened to this once and wasn't to into it but for some reason I kept coming back for more. Now I am pretty much addicted to the CD and start singing it at work...word of advice get this CD it's worth it...and if you are a true Blink 182 fan you will love this cd! :)
4,Good cd,"The first time I heard this I thought....ehh it's so-so, but after a few days of listening to it, it grew on me. I love the new style, this cd is totally different from any Blink cd. The best songs on this have to be..Stockholm Syndrome, I Miss You, Violence, and Here's Your Letter. *A word of advice*...BUY THIS CD!! you'll love it!"
4,The New cd,"I really enjoy Blink's new cd. I have listened to it at least every other day since I got it, the new music is different, in a good way. It shows that the group can write good songs without having to joke around as well. I would recommend it to of course all the blink fans and even some of those that arent."
2,I just cant...,"I just want to start by saying that I am a definite fan of Blink 182. I loved their previous albums, cheshire cat, dude ranch, enema, and take off your pants. But...this album, I'll admit, I tried VERY hard to like it cause I love Blink, but this thing is just a big mess. Mark and Travis sound horrible, the tunes are horrible, the lyrics are horrible, I just can't stand it. I listened to it 10 times straight through to try to get the album's feel, and I couldn't find it. I'm sorry guys, but I can't say this is a good album. 2 stars, extra star for their previous efforts in albums."
4,"Grammar & Spelling, huh?","This is just in response to the comment made by James from OK who states that people need to use proper grammar and spelling in their reviews...DID U MEAN ILLOGICAL INSTEAD OF 'unloGiCal' in YOUR review? Doh! Ooops, I used CAPS in this ""review"", my bad. Go buy a clue dude. Oh, yeah...go buy Blink's album. It's purrrty cool. Ooops, I spelled pretty wrong."
3,here they go.....,ive alwways kinda liked blink....but i just dont understand how the hell this could get an overall better rating than TAKE OFF YOU PANTS AND JACKET or ENEMA OF THE STATE...(those 2 are priority)best songs///...easy target & all of this (i like the way they go together)the rest are mediocorethats about all i have to say
3,old time blink fan new worries,Lyrics too slow to copy modern day emo music. Blink should stick to punk where they defined the culture. Not enough Mark. Tom singing emo when he has the ideal punk rock voice... 3 stars
3,Signs of maturing,"Blink-182, like all bands, should keep reinventing themselves to keep their fan base and their music from getting old. I listened to this album straight through about 3 times and thought it was great. Then, after about the 4th, I started realizing that its hugely repetitive and hard to listen to all the way through w/o skipping a song. Although, this is a good step forward for Blink.P.S. If you want a great punk album that can be listened to many times over, get American Idiot by Green Day."
2,blink 182's strung out presence.,"this cd isn't very good at all.now, i am not a blink 182 fan,nor a fan of pop punk at all.this cd, i think, has nothing todo with punk rock at all.this band should have stoppedputting out cd's after enema ofthe state.the only reason i give this cd2 stars is because of travis'sinnovative drumming.the guitar + bass isn't very goodat all. real simple and is justa filler-sound.eh i dont know, this cd was a bad idea."
2,OK not Great,"I have said this many times before, but I think blink peaked at enema of the state. This cd is good, but not great. It still contains a trace of old blink sound. However, some of the songs are too artsy and veering to far from the standard blink that people have grown to love. I remember in an interview Mark Hoppus once said ""you are either going to love this new cd or hate because we are trying some radical things we haven't done before."" I think I fall somewhere in-between."
3,this is a good album but not Blinks best,"Blink 182 has matured in this album and yes its good that this cd is finally different from the others and its a very good cd the fact is that I would really rather listen to their last cd take off your pants or whatever which was awesome. I do like this cd especially the songs Feeling This, Violance, Easy Target, and the song they did with the lead singer of the Cure but this cd isn't your normal Blink we've all come to expect"
4,Blink Is The Shiit So Take A Wiff,Blinks new sound is what the future needs for a better world... The new sounds is amazing and hit me where i need to be hit... Its crazy and i love it...
3,Just Ok,"After two previosuly good cd's I was expecting this cd to just kick a$$ but infact it did not. About half of the songs are catchy and the others are just slow, and boring, and un punk like. And yes whats with the emotional crap. This cd is like half emo. They better start making the next album alot faster, and more punk like without all the drama."
4,Blinks new album Lacks some stuff but still Good,"blink182 have completely changed. they have more sad songs and less stupid lyrics, but i think they lack in the great rememberable Riffs in songs such as dammit, wendy clear, stay together for the kids and others. blink have gotten more mature in thier music. I give this album a 4 because the lack of the Riffs and happiness in there songs but it still is a great album and all bands must try new things. the album would be better if they mixed the past with the new, they have done this with Feeling this and Go.Great album but could be better!"
5,BEST blink cd ever!,this is by far the best blink 182 cd ever! its my new favorite cd of all time. i cefinitley would recommennd it to almost anyone.
4,It's About Time,"(...)It's about time Blink 182 finally used their talents to do something intelligent. While still retaining a tongue in cheek since of humor this is by far the best Blink 182 cd, at least from TRUE music lover's perspective."
5,Completely amazing!,"This album is probably the best album, after dude ranch. Their songs have grown, and they have definetly used their experiences from Box Car Racer to their advantage. The music is better, and they ROCK more! 'Obvious' and 'Stockholme Syndrome' are my 2 favourite songs and also the bonus track 'Not Now' I would encourage any person to buy this CD because you ain't heard anything like this. Whatta BooST!!"
2,Very Bad,"Ok, first off this whole cd is about complaining, every song is about sad things. There old cd's were fantastic, Dude Ranch, Enema of the State, and even Take off your pants and Jacket. But this is absolutly dreadful. Are they trying to get kids to comit suiced or something. I dont think anyone wants to hear blink 182 complain about life. What happened to the type of music that made u smile and made u happy and made u think that you should live life to the fullest. And i dont buy that whole ""we wanna be mature now"". Please, you can still be mature and right GOOD music and upbeat songs. I was looking foward to buying there cd, now im gonna go outside and burn it."
2,Blink 18-WHO?,"Wow, what can i say? oh, wait, i know.....THIS CD SUCKS!!!! Don't waste your time or money on this worthless piece of crap! What happened to the good ol' days of Dammit, Rock Show, and Whats my age again? Where is the humor? The fun? This CD sounds like like something my dad would listen to! This is NOT punk, hell, this is barely even pop. Will somebody please tell these guys that they are not talented enough to be so serious!? They are trying way too hard to be ""grown up"" when the only thing that made them famous was their ""immaturity""!! The only reason i gave them 2 stars is because i have always liked these guys, and because ""feeling this"" and ""violence"" are good songs, im not sure what happened with the rest... So save your money and go buy a GOOD CD. And don't listen to all of these other morons who are trying to tell you that this CD is awesome, because they are probably deaf."
3,Not what you'd expect,"Saw Blink in 1997. Loved 'em. Saw Blink in 1999. Became OBSESSED with them. Saw Blink in 2001. They were OK.Didn't go when they toured for this one. Whatever I liked about them is gone now. Maybe I grew up, maybe I developed taste, maybe they just got terrible. I don't know. I just have a hard time listening to this CD. Nothing's sadder than when a crappy punk band decides they need to deliver their message."
1,Pretty bad,"I have to say that I was a Blink 182 fan back in the day. Dude Ranch, cheshire cat, and enema of the state were good cd's. Ever since take off your pants and jacket, they have been going down hill. If you want pop-punk... this cd will be for you. Then again, your probably into really bad pop-punk such as good charlote and simple plan. In my opinion, find some real punk, ska, or emo."
1,VERY VERY BAD!,"This is bad. It stinks. That one song ""Feeling This"" is one of the worst songs in the past decade. This is bad and you should save your money for something much much better then Blink 182!"
1,"Sorry Blink, you failed","Blink 182 tried to make a ""mature"" album after their 2 childish albums ""Enema of the State"" and ""Take Off Your Pants & Jacket"" but sorry, they failed. it came out wrong. The songs are boring, the lyrics are still lame and the production is nothing but AWFUL."
1,"it's a bad, bad day for blink...","when they completely throw everything that they have captivated audiences with, and thrown it out of the window. i am completely disappointed, and i am wondering what they were trying to go for. it's like ever since they got married and had kids, they stopped bitching about youth problems, and started obsessing over their new mature lives. its too bad, because its the bitching that grabbed everyone's attention in the first place, because the audience can so well identify with it. i am not amused by this album, and would recommend to buy something more useful for your record collection."
1,thank god for crap like this keeps posers away from my music,"blink 182.... your a crappy band, but you do me a favor. you keep 13 year old girls and wimpy red heads from listening to good bands like pantera, judas priest, anthrax, iron maiden, and megadeth"
3,Uh...,"This CD is much better than Charlottes, but punk is 52% stupid in my opinion. I listen to the good stuff. Yes this is one of them but........ Dissapointing, get something like Mudvayne or Evanescence. Mudvayne actually plays guitars well, same with Evanescence, but She sings much better and MuDvAynE doesn't sing as much they yell... On this CD theres 2 or.... 3 ok.. songs on it, but wheres the really good guitar playing..."
1,What happened?,"I was a huge fan of Blink, especialy when Enema of the State was made but Take off Your Pants and Jacket was horrible and this CD is even worse, Blink 182 really needs to think the path they're taking over again"
1,THIS CD SUCKS,These guys need to quit trying to be a punk rock band they are pop not punk and they are trying to be serious on this cd they need to quit the CRAP of trying to be punk they'll never be punk please Blink 182 I'M BEGGING YOU TO STOP DOING WANNABE PUNK MUSIC AND DO SOMETHING WORTH LISTENING TO
1,damn these guys suck!,they are NOT GOOD damn they dont even know how to play guitarsuggest you listen to some real music like metallica!
1,this CD SUCKS ASS!,"I only like one song and that is ""Go"" because Mark has some lead vocals for once! Geez! How did Mark's whiny voice get on every freaking song? And his stupid box car racer influence totally ruined it for me. Buy Dude Ranch you stupid posers and stop whining about the new found""maturity."" Shut up!"
5,Audrey's Blink 182 Review,"The album is amazing. More mature than the others, and i think it is one of the best yet. There is so much meaning in each one of the songs... and i think Travis, Tom, and Mark put a lot into making this cd. Go out and buy it, you won't be sorry, unless you're a stuck up loser..."
2,Not Punk,"Hate to break it to all you 14 year olds but this is a lousy excuse for a record. Using little chords is okay (the Sex Pistols did it), but this album has no value. Blink continues to make records that sound the same - boring, unsophisticated and trite. And for the last time this is not Punk. Where is the outrage, politics and rebellion? If you 14 year old girls want real punk, go buy Never Mind, the Bullocks (The Sex Pistols), The Clash (the Clash) and London Calling, the best album of all time also by the Clash."
5,:),"I seriously dunno y ppl think this CD sucks or is better than any other Blink 182 have done. Yea I agree that its a lot more serious but it just shows that Blink has the ability of being serious, or humorous, punk, or hard, and that shows real talent. so stop hating ppl, cuz Blink rules! I rest my case :)"
2,"please, gimme sum GOOD music","fist off i have to say, im what most people would call a ""blink fan"", but this album just made me wanna erase that chapter from my life. This album is decent at most. I started listening to blink when chesaw cat came out, and i though they were a great band. But as there popularity grew, there songs and there music changed to suit MTV. There albums got progressively worse, and this was te last straw. This album would hav got 0 stars from me if not for the albums two saving graces, Miss you, with its excelent accoustics, and stockholm syndrom, going back to there more hard core roots. This album should put the guys from blink to shame, but with another album like box car racer. they could redeme their selves"
4,old school,"Blink 182 seems to have left there more humerious songs out of this album, here they take it old school with impressive lyrics, and smashing guitars"
3,And,"And so Blink goes 'Emo'...The lyrics are as good as ever, except most of the songs are slow, 'Emo' songs that are just depressing and not that great. Their older CD's were a lot better, so don't buy this unless you are an Emo freak, which a lot of people seem to be now."
3,new blink isnt as good,"I was a little dissappointed cuz i was excepting another Take Off Your Pants And Jacket (which i loved) or enema and what i got was a cd that i think is worse than box car racer. i bought this CD for feeling this and i excepting all the songs to be like it. I bought box car racer about 4 weeks ago and listened to it and liked most of the songs but this was diffrent. There were to many weird sounds and things that they did and almost all of their songs are boring and depressing and you just wanna skip right through them. After i listened to them for a little bit though they got a little bit better They really have no more fun/funny songs anymore. I dont think blink 182 ""maturing"" was a good thing at all."
3,"ehhh, not their best","This is no where near blink 182's best album. I remember seeing blink play in small clubs way back in the day when no one knew who they were. Those were the days. Chesire Cat was such a great album, then Dude Ranch came along and was even better. Those were blink's finest days. This album doesn't even come close to the greatness of those albums. Tom's voice sounds really bad on this album. I actually skip over Feeling This because his voice is so damn annoying on that song. I do like how they've matured over the years and wern't afraid to change their sound on this album. Some of the lyrics were well written and actually had some meaning behind them, and I like the little techno sounding intro to Violence, which is probably my favorite song on the album. The song they did with Robert Smith was really good too. Travis's drumming was excellent and I kinda like Tom's new guitar style. This album was everything I expected it to be. Not their best, but not totally dissapointing."
4,Different than what I expected,Blink-182's new self titled CD was different than I expected. Its a good album but not like The Enemy of the State or Take off Your Pants and Jacket. Buy it anyway. You will be glad that its been 2 years since their last record.
4,Boxcar Racer Pt. 2,"Ok, as the rest of the world has already said, this is defenitly not an ""typical"" blink album, but that's not a bad thing. It did take me a couple of listens to really get into it, but now fully appriciate it. It is defenitly like boxcar racer pt. 2, but the boxcar racer cd is better for that kind of style. U guys just have to remember that mark, tom and travis have grown up- and so have most of their fans. They're freakin' fathers now, guys- they're at a different point in their lives and their music is reflecting that... don't hate on them for growing as artists and people. It's defenitly a cd you should go out and get."
2,Not what I expected,"I have been a fan of Blink 182 since Cheshire Cat and have liked everything they've put out since then. To be honest, I dont care for this album. There were a few good songs but overall I dont like the new style. I did buy the album because Blink 182 is one of my favorite bands but this album is my least favorite. I believe the album is good it just not what I like to listen to."
5,THIS CD ROCKS!!!,"Not sure what to expect from their newest cd, I gave it a tenative listen. IT'S SO GOOD!!!! These guys have definitely matures since their last album. I mean, the ""sentiment"" expressed in Happy Holidays on Take Off Your Pants And Jacket is nowhere to be found on this album. And having Robert Smith (The Cure is hands down the greatest band of all time) sing on All Of This just makes this album even better. The only thing that's annoying is the little love letter. It's a fine idea, but the girl who reads it is SOOOO danged melodramatic. It's annoying. But the rest is awesome. I recommend this album to anyone who liked their older stuff, especially if you wanna see some serious maturation."
4,"a good one, but certainly not the best","this is a good cd, with some really good beats and songs, but it's definitely not their best. this time they've totaly changed. it's no more of those stupid pointless funny songs, but seriousy type songs. They have some weird run on songs where one ends and another starts but you cant tell the difference. they also wasted 2 songs i believe on just weird instrumental voice stuff. this album is enjoyable, most of the songs are good such as #1-5 #7-10 and #13 the rest are the werid ones to me. overall good cdbut other albums were better. hopefully next album if there is any, they will go back to their old style and not try to be so seriousbut their shows are really good, i went to the jimmy kimmel live one and met them @ best buy in irvine, they are really nice and their shows are full of energy. =]"
4,Something new and different,"I would have to say this is a big turn around for Blink. It is not my favorite album but it beats Take off your pants and jacket a lot. Their last two albums were starting to sound the same and there was really nothing different.With this album they turned it all around. I was afraid when I heard it sounds ""different"" I would not like it but I was amazed that they pulled it off and still made it Blink-like. It beats making yet another enema of the state, let's them re-invent them selves.If you like'd blink's older albums and were ready for a change, this is the album for you."
5,ROCKS MY SOCKS,I think the new albulm is a more mature and emotional albulm! The riffs are awesome and so are the lyrics! Travis is amazing on drums! Everyone can relate to atleast one song on this albulm while doing some major rocking!! I suggest everyone go pick it up!!
5,best yet,"This new album is the best album from blink yet...except of course The Mark Tom And Travis Show. I have no idea where people get off saying its not good but obviously they are dropping acid.STAND OUT TRACKS: Obvious, I Miss You, Violence, Stockholm Syndrome, Down, The Fallen Interlude, Go, Asthenia, Always, Easy Target, Heres Your Letter, I'm Lost Without YouFILLER TRACKS: Feeling This, All of This"
5,New direction great album,"It's definitely different, but it's great. They have a more serious sound and have grown up more. It isn't as pop as previous albums, but they still have it in songs like ""Feeling This."" This album is as good as all the others and I recommend that everyone get it."
5,This album rocks!,"Hey party people! Do you love Blink-182? Well you're about to love them even more. Their new self-titled album is awesome. It's their best album yet. It combines their trademark sound along with a new, more musically creative sound. Every song sounds like they really spent some time on working out every detail -- from the lyrics to the melody to the instruments being played. It's like Blink-182 had a ""new discovery"" of music and wanted to share it with the world.Be sure to buy this album -- you'll enjoy it for years to come!"
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??!?!,"do not even add the words punk to associate to this band. they are pop. im reading reviews about the mature lyrics... i guess theyre talking about such deep and inspiring lyrics as I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this){I love all the things you do} / {I wanna take off her clothes} (I'm feeling this)wow.. im pretty sure that sounds pop to me . real punk would not be on mtv. real pop would not be on trl or geffen records. they are with the exception of travis a bunch of posers who know for sure they would never dare play their music at a ""punk"" club because they would get their whinny asses kicked. i dont know why the cures singer would grace their untalented asses with his presence. if you want real punk(not pop) listen to dead kennedys MISFITS samhain TSOL Shai Halud anti-flag AFI"
1,THIS SUCKS,"wow this is bad. i own buddah, chesire cat, dude ranch, enema, mark tom and travis show, tojpaj and those r all good albums. if it let me i would give this cd a 0 out of 5 stars. all the members of blink r married except travis(hence travis is the only good 1 in the band) so they wanted to be more mature. they did a great job in making a terrible, mature cd. none of these songs with the excpetion of ""go"" r anything liek their old stuff. songs liek ""The Fallen Interlude"" and ""I'm Lost Without You"" r some of the worst songs i've ever heard and never would have expected blink to come up wit crappy songs liek that. i dont c how anyone can like the record and not liek britney spear's music and nsync. i suggets mark tom and tarvis should go bakc to the way they used to be or call it quits and break up as a band beacuse this SH*T SUCKS"
1,I liked them better back when they were called Green Day!,Blink 182 prove yet again that sub-par music these days will make you rich. They're an awful live band. Tom Delonge has the most annoying voice ever. Mark Hoppus makes can't play decent bass to save his life!! Their is nothing about this band that stands out other than the drummer. The drummer is exceptionally skilled. He's wasting his talents creating forgetable music like this.
5,AWSOME CD,The New blink 182 CD is awsome i recomend it to anyone who is a blink 182 fan it may be different that there other stuff in the past but its still awsome and worth it to buy it i know when i got it when it came out i loved it awsome CD ~BLINK 182 ROCKS~
2,Blinkrules6969,"I am a total Blink fan and have every one of their CD's. This is by far the worst one yet. Yes, they progressively get worse with each one, after Dude Ranch, of course. I am willing to bet that only one of their songs from this CD will make it on the airwaves, the rest is over emotional garbage. And what's with all of them thanking God on their CD? So they found God and love? How nice! This CD is awesome if your are in love and expecting a child. For the rest of us true punk fans, forget it. Ahhhhh, how cute that the blink boys have grown up and got in touch with their feminine sides."
2,what is travis thinking,"i guess as beeing ... im sorta the age group the pop-punk genre is aiming at but this sucks i only gave it two stars for travis's drumming, ive heard a few of the songs off this album but just from hearing the song feeling this i can make a prediction.i actully like toms voice but the lyrics on well all there cds are stupid but they used to be funny(ie.)cheshire cat,Buddha,and dude ranch but lately they just suck.mark hoppus cant play bass tom cant play guitar and then travis holy crap is one of the best drummers ever and a member of a reat band nonot blink i mean the transplants bet you little mall posers didnt know that trav needs to stop wasting his time on blink and if youwant real punk get some minor threat misfits nofx the germs(best punk band ever)rancid dead kennedys sex pistols ramones the clash flogging molly the stooges stiff little fingers anti-flag or even the strokes"
1,Why?,"Why have they changed their style? I can understand that they are getting older and such but they should really stick to what they do best and that's write songs that are quick, catchy and funny, not this slow, boring, depressing music that frequently appears over the album. And what is up with that monologue between tracks 4 and 5, makes me want to go to sleep. This album is their worst so far and that includes their first albums ever."
2,Pura estrategia marketinera,"Indudablemente en algún momento despues de ""Take off.."" se sentaron Tom, Mark y Travis a charlar con su productor.Se dieron cuenta que habían llegado a la escena varias bandas como Sum41, Good Charlotte, o The Ataris que podían hacer musica que sonaba parecida a la de ellos y con bastante exito.Dijeron: muchachos vamos a tener que cambiar; porque sino se nos va a acabar el negocio. Ya no somos novedad. ¿Que tal si nos hacemos los serios y los duros? Podríamos tener un sonido mas seco, con un poco mas de percusión y seríamos mas creibles.Basta de intentar ganar mas plata!!!! Me defraudaron. A su disco a lo sumo se lo voy a comprar a un pirata en mp3.Son peor que Justin Timberlake!!!!Mucho peor!!!"
2,Very dissapointing,"This cd mixes what made the original blink original and this horrible experimentation with different styles. It's punkish for most of it, but falls apart with beats and slow,long songs, not popular with older fans. This cd proves they are sellouts of what could have been a real good punk cd and not some more bubblegum rock that our youth is fed. Like Good charlotte and simple plan. The worst groups. Anybody that buys this cd better have a backup cd after hearing this for more than a month."
1,So lazy they have to butcher an amazing song,"I'm glad that Blink-182 stopped making music, because they felt like they could get away with writing generic lyrics and music. By the way, Stockholm Syndrome was a horrible cover of an amazing song by the band Muse and doesn't even come close to matching the original. Do yourself a favor and by Muse's Absolution album instead. It has that song on it."
1,Blink 182 is the Backstreet Boys of Punk,"Note: This is a review of the band as well as the album.That's right. You heard me. I compared your favorite ""punk"" band to a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. Now why would I go and do a thing like that? Probably because Blink 182 is a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. I can't begin to comprehend why so many people like them. They're just a bunch of stupid frat-boys who sing about their exes and humping dogs. Even songs that show the slightest bit of potential are ravaged by De Longes grating vocals. The fact that they've recieved so much attention from sell-out programs like MTV and TRL should prove the point I'm trying to make and quell any arguments immediately. So please wake up and buy a real punk album like ""London Calling"" or ""Give 'Em Enough Rope."""
1,Blink 000,I love blink 182 i own all of their albums but this one i have to review. THIS ALBUM SUCKED. it was their worst yet n for all of u punk fans out their odnt buy this is way to soft go buy dude ranch.
5,Wow! Blink at its Best!,"Man, Blink 182 has changed in this album. But, in this case, change is for the better. I have been a longtime Blink fan, and this is different than anything else i've heard from them. The only problem I have with this album is that some of the songs are very dark and have weird beats and intros(example:Obvious, The Fallen Interlude) But, overall it is a solid album. The best songs are Feeling This and Asthenia(the NASA transmission is cool) So go out and buy this CD. I'm sure, if you like this kind of music than you'll love it"
5,WICKED,"when i purchased this cd i expected a funnier, more vibrant cd than the last. i thought i was getting wild blink 182. boy was i wrong- i got better. the music is awesome with the drums louder, faster and harder thanks to travis, bass more complex by tom, and guitar awesome as ever with mark. never have i heard blink 182 this good."
5,New Direction,"Amazing new disk from the guys at Blink, the music just keeps on changing and keeps on getting better. Not only are the songs a progression from their other work, but each song on the disk provides something different. If you're looking for more of the old Chesire Cat stuff, then sorry but they're passed that stage of their musical careers and I don't think that they're going back. Enjoy this new disk for what it is, an amazing collection of songs."
5,blinkin ace,The new album was certainly worth the wait it sounds more towards the box car racer end of the scale but i love it!!!
4,This may take some getting used to...but extremely promising,"About two years ago the big ""punk debate"" came up at a studio I was working in. I remember saying that Blink 182 really didn't belong in the punk catagory. They might have at one point, but from Enema Of The State onward, they were really just a New Wave band on speed. This album couldn't have fit that classification any better. Christ, Robert Smith from the Cure co-wrote and contributed to a song on here. Not that that is a bad thing at all. This album is very, very different for this band. And Kudos to them for trying to be different then their peers. Sure the heavy guitars and drums can be heard throughout the record but the Blink guys seem to be more intrested in visiting the other side of early 80's music. Let's hope they continue to evolve. This isn't their best work, but it shows a lot of guts."
3,NOT Feeling This,"This is definitely NOT Blink's best album. Usually, Blink has entertaining songs with great riffs- like the songs from Dude Ranch, Enema of the State, and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. However, this contains none of these songs. After listening to the CD, I am NOT Feeling This. Tom's voice is ANNOYING and all the songs are bland and boring. I wouldn't buy this CD unless you are a hardcore Blink fan. Hopefully the next CD is better."
2,big dissapointment,"this CD is a VERY big disappointment and is not worth buying. If you like the old Blink182 then do not buy this CD. It is nothing like it. That is why it is a dissapointment. ""Feeling This"" is the only good song they have on the CD. Nothing like the old Blink 182."
1,It Makes Me Shudder,"*Shudder* Ughhh. Blink 182. Where do i begin? Oh, yes. Do not buy, do not buy, do not buy, do not buy... The CD makes me shudder. Why does it exist? Will it never leave me be?!? STOP TORMENTING ME, OH EVIL MUSIC WITH A SINGER WHO CANNOT PRONOUNCE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!!!! Spend your money on something more worthwhile, i beg you. Sorry to all the Blink fans, enjoy your band, though how you can i do not know, but to all the people considering it: No. Don't touch that order button. DO NOT CLICK. Disconnect and back slowly away from the computer. That's right. Now, run run run! Okay, I'm done now."
3,Where Is The Blink We All Know And Love?,"After listening to this album, one is either in Group A or Group B. Group A dislikes this album and wishes that Tom, Travis, and Mark stuck to the original formula and Group B loves this new sound and think it's time to grow up. I'm in the middle, which a lot of people are. Some say that their intro to fatherhhod has made their music more mature or whatever, but we all miss the old Blink. This should have been a Boxcar Racer album. Don't get me wrong, I love them too, but it's sad to think the Blink sound that we all grew up listening too is gone. The only song on the album which even kinda sounds like their oldselves is Feeling This. Now this is a great album, but let's face it, it will not sell as much as many of their previous ones. Who knows, they might go back to their roots on the next album. Or they may not. This album without a title may show that it's a new beginning. Is this change good or bad? Record sales and fans will soon let you know."
3,questions about PA labels...,"yeah this album is oki don't think its worth all the hype being thrown around about iti guess i'd like it more if i was a drummer and not a bassist...but this cd brings something strange to mind...how can a cd contain many swear words on almost every song *cough*greenday's nimrod*cough* and not get stickered, while a cd like this has 2 'bad' words on it total and gets slapped w/ the sticker? i mean blink's other stuff definitely deserves a PA sticker... but this (as far as i know) is relatively quite clean and reverent... which is a little disappointing"
3,The old stuff is way better!,"Don't get me wrong. This CD is good, but it doesn't deliver what the old stuff did. This stuff is slower, and it isn't as funny as their old stuff was, and that's what Blink is supposed to be. Although a couple songs are similar to those on their previous CD's, the new stuff is slower and more serious. It's worth buying and listening to, but like me, you'll end up putting it on the shelf and pulling out some Dude Ranch or something. Good, but not good enough."
5,Could It Be Any Better...,"This album is a work of art, start to finish. Forget what you knew about blink before, and listen to the hear and now. This is WAY better than anything they've ever done before, and I've heard it all. You MUST GET THIS ALBUM if your an emo/punk/pop punk or Alt. Rock fan. It has Everything, including a really cool Linkin Parkish Interlude..."
3,Kind of a let down,"This cd really let me down bc i thought that it was going to be more of a funny cd, like take off your pants and jacket and enema of the state. i also thought that it would be more fast pace and have better lyrics. the only two songs that i liked on this album were violence and stockholm syndrome, go was pretty good too. i hope their next cd will be better."
4,Well You Stupid boffin wanna bes can STFU!,"blink182 have completely changed. they have more sad songs and less stupid lyrics, but i think they lack in the great rememberable Riffs in songs such as dammit, wendy clear, stay together for the kids and others. blink have gotten more mature in thier music. I give this album a 4 because the lack of the Riffs and happiness in there songs but it still is a great album and all bands must try new things. the album would be better if they mixed the past with the new, they have done this with Feeling this and Go.Great album but could be better!"
3,Blinks experiment hasnt completely succeeded....,"I have been a fan of blink for a long time, and i bought this CD figuring it would be just as good as any/all of them. However, when i put in the stereo, i thought i was sorely mistaken. My first time listening to this CD, i would have given it a 1. But after listening to it a couple more times, i realized that there were really some good songs on here, and some of their experimentation did indeed succeed. I found this to be most evident in the song violence, which in my opinion is the best song on the CD. But still, I couldn't get myself to like this CD enough to give it a great score of 4 or 5. In a surprising number of songs, Tom's voice is just plain annoying, and some of the songs are annoying as well, especially #11 (i forgot the name of it). Overall, It's worth a purchase, but be prepared for a totally different experience that may not be for the best."
4,Still great,"As soon as I found out Blink 182 was coming out with a new cd I couldn't wait. I bought it the day it came out and listened to it right away. I already liked the song feeling this, but was not disappointed with the rest of the album. In my opinion it is different than most of the blink 182 stuff i have heard in the past 4 years. i can not quite put my finger on what the difference is. they sound more mature and less pop. if you are a blink 182 fan, buy this cd. if you aren't buy it anyways. it is a great cd and ranks up with the best cd's of the last couple of years."
5,blink SOLD OUT (5 stars only because of travis is a god),blink 182 is not the same as they once were. they sold out. the only reason to buy this cd is because travis is a god but other than that this cd sucks. blink made this cd because they knew all the little poser emo kids would buy it and that just pisses me off. the world must be coming to an end because all the good music of yesterday is turning into prissy punk like good charolette and simple plan. these bands make so-called music just because they feel sorry for themselves and want the world to feel sorry for them too. now anyone who wears a trucker hat or a tie is automatically punk. no. thats a poser. the only true punk left now is NOFX. and if they sell out like blink and less than jake i think i just may have to cry.
5,Maggers Review - Blink 182 new album,"The new blink 182 album actually is amazin, any blink fan will definitely love it. But I wreckon a lot of people out there who have never been into blink mite really like this album, it is different to their usual stuff, my favourite songs on the album would probably be always, feeling this, stockholm syndrome and I miss you, It is a kick ass album so BUY IT!!!!!"
5,like blink 182? by this cd,"if youve liked blink in the past u will probably like this cd. it has some old blink style, some blink humor, and some new stuff they picked up along the way. its got fastly paced rock, and slower stuff with killer guitar and bass. theyve used several different tunings for new sound and genius song ideas and lyrics. The cd layout itself is good too. its not like u listen to some fast stuff in the beginning, and then get bored with slower songs at the end. its all scattered out through the whole cd"
5,BLINK IS THE BEST!!!,"Look, blink 182's latest album, BLINK 182, it the BEST!!Every song on the album is greatThey have matured so much, its not about high school anymore.These are real songs, all of them GREAT!!!Just buy it already!!!!!"
4,Amazing,"Blink 182 surprised me with this album. After hearing ""Take off your pants and jacket"", I was reluctant to get this cd because I thought it would be poppy like their 2001 release. I was wrong. This album is much more musically diverse, a little harder, but still has catchy lyrics that blink fans are use to. I just recently obtained this album, but so far it's my 2nd favorite blink album behind ""Dude Ranch"". This is a must have for any Blink 182 fan, and is definately worth giving a chance."
4,If you liked Box Car Racer.......,"I must first tell you that I am not a huge Blink Fan. They are good musicians, but all the kiddie songs distort how good they can be. Box Car Racer, the Travis and Tom side project was just a glimpse at how good they could be. This disc is a step in the right direction. They don't need to resort junior high humor to make this disc something any Blink fan would love to have."
3,Different.....,"I heard the entire leak of this album bout 2 weeks ago and I was surprised. Some of it (like obvious) is a lot like boxcar style, while others like miss you, stockhoolm syndrome, easy target and go are completly new and cool. Blink definatly aren't th remost talented group of guys but they can sure write sum catchy tunes. If you like blink, ul love ths record, its more sderiosu but still fun and is worth a good listen."
4,Refreshing,"I love Blink's old sound. Which is exactly the reason I am happy that they kept it in about 50% of this CD. You will hear the good ole Blink 182 such as ""Feeling This"", ""Obvious"", ""Down"", ""Go"", ""Always"" etc. However, I like their new sounds just as much. ""Stockholm Syndrome"" is amazing and ""All of This"" is probably the best song Blink 182 has ever published. In the end I would buy this CD if only for ""All of This"". People who don't like the song don't respect the origin of bands like Blink 182, because this is very retro to the kind of music Blink claims to like themselves."
5,Blink 182 is still the Best!!!!!!!!,"I have always been a Blink 182 fan and i have all their CDs starting since their first one, Flyswatter. When i first listened to their CD i was like ""is this really Blink 182""!? I agree that they really did change their style of playing and has become more hardcore. You have to listen to the Cd atleast twice before you start really liking this CD..Its awesome and i really enjoy it. The drums are awesome and possibly harder to play to than the other CDs cept for some other songs. My favorite song is probably Easy Target but i love them all. Blink rocks!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT!,"this cd is great. blink has changed their style, but its great...1. Feeling This 8/102. Obvious 8/103. I Miss You 10/104. Violence 8/105. Stockholm Syndrome 9/106. Down 10/107. The Fallen Interlude 4/108. Go 9/109. Asthenia 10/1010. Always 8/1011. Easy Target 8/1012. All of This 6/1013. Here's Your Letter 9/1014. I'm Lost Without You 7/1015. Not Now* 11/10Overall the cd is great and definetely one of my favs and gonna be in my cd player for a long time"
4,Great,"This CD I believe is an extension of the Box Car Racer album. So good. Totally different direction, I love it. I was starting to get really tired of Blink playing in the pop-punk category, because I knew they had this kind of potential. Thank you Blink182 for releasing an album that really shows your true musical character."
4,...,"After listening to the album, one word came to mind: Wow. Like everyone else is saying, this album is completely different from the usual Blink style. The songs are so deep and just really show a different layer of Blink. Some tracks are strange and really hard to interpret but overrall the CD is worth every penny, classic."
4,"A New Direction, A New Sound","Hardcore Blink fans beware. Those of you who only liked the old days of fast power chords and simple lyrics may not be on the same page on this album. Blink spent over half a year in the studio making this album and it shows. Each song is polished and features awesome layering and sounds not found anywhere else. The sound is like nothing else. You can really tell they didn't rush the process at all. For fans that have evolved along with the band's sound such as myself will find this CD to be mind boggling. Personal favourite tracks include Obvious, Violence, I'm Lost Without You, Asthenia, Down, and I'm Miss You. Lyrics are also a lot darker and deeper then previous albums. All in all a new experience. Ejoy!"
2,Box Car Racer 2,"This CD is pretty good, but its nothing special, its just a Box Car Racer CD. most songs are pretty boring and sloppy. Mark hardly ever sings, Tom's vocals arent very good here. There is only one song that sounds like Blink besides Feeling This and thats Asthenia. All the songs are trying to be sad and serious but few succeed. If you like Box Car racer more than Blink, you will be happy with this CD, if you like old Blink you wont. By the way if you like ""Feeling This"" keep in mind its the best song on this CD and none other sound like it. others that are pretty good are:""I Miss You"" (but it gets boring w/o the chorus),""Easy Target"" (but Mark trys a bit to hard to sound hardcore in the chorus, which is the only good part)""Im Lost Without You"" (but its too long and has hardly any lyrics, its very repetitive and has the most random out of place drum solo at the end. its 4 minutes too long)Recommended for hardcore fans only."
2,"I like Blink, but I don't like this album.","I own every blink album since Cheshire cat, and I've been a fan since '98 when Dude Ranch came out. I'm not the type to start hating a band just because they get popular.However, I'm also not the type to blindly praise everything the band does. In this case, I would have to say that Blink has changed radically from what its original sound was, and I, for one, am not diggin' it. For those of you who like the new sound, that's fine. But its not the Blink that I know and love. Even the songs that have the old Blink ""sound"" aren't very good. Go buy the new Less Than Jake instead :)"
4,Tom DeLong: A Vocal Hog on this album,"Now dont get me wrong I love this album, however, the very thing i always liked about Blink 182 is the fact that both Tom and mark shared vocals equally. However on this album, Tom sings on it wayyyyy too much. I feel like every song that plays, I cant get away from his high pitched whiny voice. I wonder why Mark didnt really sing on it that much, and the songs he does sing on, Once again, Tom insists on making his voice heard. Kinda seems like Tom has an ego on this record. Lets face it, Mark has the better voice, and even though Tom probably wrote a majority of the material, I feel Mark should have sang some of Tom's songs such as Asthenia, Always, Im Lost Without You, and possibly even Violence. For god's sake Tom, let mark sing, we've heard enough of you! Its only fair that on the next Blink Album, Mark should sing a majority of the songs."
5,COOL!,"This has to be one of blink's best cd's. In ROLLING STONE it was rated in the 50's best albums and good thing they did put it in there cause it's really good. No joke songs this time... but there still fast singing and good songwriting. AS TRAVIS said: ""this album is the darkest and deepest album we ever had."" It's still good though. Buy it now, it's very good!!"
4,"Pretty good, not what you would think","I like this cd in general, but this cd is different than the rest of the Blink albums, Feeling this is really a cool song, and its like the old blink. I feel that blink have become softer as a band, and matured alot. I really wasn't expecting this cd sound like this after hearing the single Feeling this. Overall is pretty good though. I myself can relate to some of the lyrics, but it just dosen't seem like Blink."
1,What the...?,"What the hell is this? This IS NOT BLINK. Major labels have programmed computers to have Mark and Tom's voices and made the most uber-nu emo-wack album I've ever heard! If I didn't know this was in fact THE blink-182 of old, I'd just classify it as another one of those ""Oven Fresh"" bands you've never heard of and don't care to hear because they SOUND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE out there right now. I have to agree with another review: IT'S ALL TRAVIS' FAULT!!! He's a badass on the drums and all, but what the heck was that Boxcar Racer thing?!?! And now the band has gone completely wuss-core on everyone. Tom and Mark aren't talented enough to play this type of music! There was a reason their first four (yes, FOUR, not SIX like everyone says) albums were made up of 3 chords in different progressions. Hopefully they'll realize this new album was a mistake and will go back to the old formula because if they stick with songwriting like this, they'll blow it."
1,wtf is this........,"OMG .... for everyone who says this is actually good. WOW!!!!!!!All I say is that wow this blows. The only good song is ""Go"". Feeling this is decent. For all those posers who say this is blinks best album ... this is totally not!!!! Their best album is ""DUDE RANCH"" with their old drummer, Scott Raynor. He was their best drummer ... travis blows .... Whatever Im out .. and my fav . blink 182 song is MMs.... for sure"
1,Pfft,"Don't buy this worthless wall of sound. I had heard that Blink 182 had matured and were coming out with a totally different feeling to their songs. I had hated them before, and I still hate their music now.Anyways, so a friend actually bought this crap. You people think this is mature? ARE YOU INSANE? This is crap clearly directed towards lonely teenagers! That's not mature, that's just flat out conformist garbage.You want mature? Try just about any Iron Maiden or Black Sabbath. It will change your music views completely. FOREVER!UP THE IRONS!!!"
1,Mediocre Green Day!,"Blink 182 try so hard to be punk,but not matter how hard they try,they still suck.They are the lamest band in the world!The only things they are good at are running around naked,making stupid videos and acting dumb!And the thing which annoys me the most is that they try to copy Green Day(which is the best punk band of all time).Their songs suck so if you wanna listen to real punk rock,buy GREEN DAY CDs instead!"
1,What The Hell Happened?,"WARNING: Blink have changed. And not for the better. Sure, they've grown musically but what happened to the music that made you smile? What happened to the poppy melodies? What happened to the guitar? And the crazy album titles? What happened to our dear neighbour Bob who humped the dog? I dont know but one things for sure, they arent here. Blink have officially SOLD OUT. They no longer care about the music, they only care about sleeping on their huge piles of money. Who knew they would ever stoop down so low? They've turned to emo, the music thats considered ""cool"" right now to please all the teenies who watch MTV. I love Blink and I always will but this album is a MAYJOR disapointment."
1,"what happened, plz tell me.","this is one band, whom no matter how bad their previous release was, finds a way to go lower. other than the anomaly between budda and chesire, this crew has found a way to diminish with each successive album. chesire - unbelievable album. dude ranch - 98% equally deserving. then came the pop junk ""enema""- whose most popular buyers, if you look closely, also bought britney spears and n' syncs greatest hits. i thought that was a new low. then came whatever the hell it was, and now this. something even the prom queens won't dance to. plz blink, if you want to avoid that jazz, get back to the roots you were so damn good at, PUNK. take it from me, if you're truly an old blink fan, just give up, they died a long time ago. for that cash, we would have all done the same though. so for all you britney fans out there hating me, hate on. oh, and buy the album, you'll love it."
1,Lost in the Blink of an Eye (or) They got Married!,"Mark still rocks and always will, Travis was always dodgy and Tom has been increasingly losing it. What happened? My favorite band ever is now Metalica, three brilliant bloody albums and then this self indulgent RUBBISH, its broken my heart. The album is not bad if it was by some creepy Scandinavian band or cheesy New York neo-punks but this is Blink! However I hope people buy it so the labels will pick them up for another try, no more babbies, no more Cure, no more flippin domesticity, the only redeaming bit was Travis giving a shout out to his Divorce Attorney, now only if Mark and Tom could cut him loose too! jhvanrenns@hotmail.com"
1,"Clever.. ""let's 'borrow' Nirvana's logo, and play pop!""","The logo on this cd is a rip off of an old Nirvana patch. Not only did BLink ""borrow"" from bands like the Casualties, the 4 Skins, the Partisans, the Exploited, and others, but they took Nirvana's logo. Nice..."
4,best blink album in a long time,"I had given up on Blink after take off your pants. Every song sounded the same and was stupid. Then this album came out. Talk about a shocker of an album. I was surprised at how good it was. This album is different than previous efforts. It has quite a few slower tracks. Standout ones include feeling this, obvious, violence, go, all of this and i miss you. What's great is that they finally grew up. Both Mark and Tom are married and Travis has a new girlfriend. They all fell in love and this helped to mature them. They are happy and content with life. It really shows on this album when you read this lyrics and listen to the songs. Songs like M+M's where they want girlfriends are the past. Songs like Feeling this where they just want to be with their girl are the future."
3,your all sheep!!!,"yeah whatever, this cd is okay, better than most crap. but seriously, why dont you try a little harder and look for the really good stuff instead of taking whats handed to you. TRL wont play the gems. they go by unnoticed. so blink is okay, nothing new for all of you who flip about how ""new"" it is. NOFX, early SUNNY DAY REAL ESATE and many others are the reason this exists. and if you want to hear some really good new stuff, go out of your way to find the WRENS, AM/FM, and the BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE. this stuff makes blink 182 look like exactly what they are, a TRL band. and if youre a TRL kid, then hats off to you, ths is your record, otherwise, look behind the blink 182 rock and you might find the golden pop songs youre really lusting after."
5,Blink Rules!,"I'm a huge Blink 182 fan! I love all of their music. I truly recommend their new album. It's different from their other albums, but it grows on you. You won't be let down!"
2,Box car racer,"The cd is not a great. It will never be! The thing is I used to listen to blink 182 to feel better. Now Tom and Travis, since they are box car racers have taken the serious thing..well, way too seriously. Mark wanted another fun cd...but Tom & Travis didn't- so its not the whole band's problem."
4,Can you say Boxcar 182?,"this new cd, i had very high expectations for. for the most part these expectations were filled but seriously i like the old, more fun, ""immature"", blink better. they have in my opinion gotten away from their ""punk roots"" which defined them. now they are a lot more emo, and i think they sound exactly like BOXCAR RACER, which is not a bad thing, but it is not the blink i have come to enjoy. i suggest you buy this cd, because it is still a really good album, just not the normal blink 182.. and if you dont think they sound like boxcar, listen to feeling this by blink.. and i feel so by boxcar- they are identical.. just buy the album, you should like it"
5,It rocks,"Although I love the Enema and TOYP albums, i never really thought that Blink would make another album as good as Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat, however they have proved me wrong. This CD is amazing, much more mature than anything blink have mayed before, this album seems like a combination of BCR and blink, with a few transplants beats thrown in, unbelievable. Standout tracks are Asthenia, I Miss You and Stockholm Syndrome. 10/10, best cd of the year along with rancid - indestructible and afi - sing the sorrow"
5,surpassed my expectations,"I bought this album with the normal blink 182 sound in my head but after listening, it's different and better than all of their past albums. You can hear how they have matured on this album into even more talented musicians. The whole album is awesome, every aspect of it - lyrics, instruments, vocals... amazing."
3,"More mature? Yes, but certainly not as fun","I've been listening to blink for quite a long time, and the main thing that i enjoyed was their fun, irreverent (to say the least) style and sound. Any semblance of this is gone on the new album, though it does sound nice. If you expect more of the same from blink, the sound that has drawn them many fans, you won't be getting what you expect from this decent, but definitely non-blinkish cd."
4,Blink 182 continue to surprise,"Ever since ""All the Small Things"" I, along with many others was hooked to these fantastic three guys. Enjoying moments of bizarre antics and laughter, who thought these guys would change? But they have...Many people are calling this the album where they grow up, including the band themselves. It's very interesting to see the new direction they are taking the band, after nearly splitting due to Box Car Racer. The new album is great. Awesome. Fantastic. The best ever. My favourite tracks are ""Obvious"" and ""Violence"". Grab yourself a copy of this, 'cause you're going to be happy that you did. A great album to dance to, and feel happy, even if all the lyrics don't seem to be. Blink have created another master work."
5,Awesome,"This is such a killer CD. It just blows my mind when I listen to some of their old stuff and then here this. It is so wonderfully put together, and the guys are such great musicians, and very talented indeed. All and all a very good CD."
5,A change that's worth it,"The new blink182 album is simply amazing.Blink has grown up from their old punk rock days. The songs on this album are much more mature but just as amazing. This is trully a 5/5 album. From the amazing drumming in ""Stockholm Sydrome"" to the emotional lyrics in ""I Miss You"" and ""Lost without you"" you should definetly pick this album up."
5,Their best album,In my opinion this album is by far blink's best. The sound is far more unique and stronger. Travis's drumming is amazing and Tom and Marks lyrics are deep and emotional what more could u ask for? If you like blink's last album you'll love this one for sure!
5,The First Blink - 182 CD,"I titled it the first blink 182 cd because travis said that they treated it as the first blink cd when they went to record it. In my opinion the cd sounds like whole new rejuvenated blink 182. Like the first album of maybe other albums to come,that have this new Pop-punk sound. The album is good on so many levels. EVery song has sonmething catching in it that you just remember. For feeling this..the chorus is very catchy..the same with violence..i can honestly say i think everysong on the cd is amazing..everysong sounds different which is awsome..Ive liked blink since 97' wen i heard dammit..and when i heard this new cd..it was bringing all of those emotions back..because i was so mystiphied at the sound of Blink 182."
2,...Different,"I got all excited about the new Blink-182 album and I ran out and bought it the day it came out. I love the song 'Feeling This' and all of their previous albums. But... this one isn't just isn't like Blink-182. Their last cd, ""Take off your pants and jacket"", was a good mix of good old immature Blink-182 with a new flavor of maturity. I didn't like the cd at first but i began to realize how well the new songs complemented the rest of their material for a little more mature song writing. I was expected more of the same with their lastest cd. However, I was disapointed. Some of the songs just plain suck. It sounds a lot like Boxcar Racer does (if you don't know Boxcar Racer is basically Blink-182 without Mark and sounds a little more mature and not as upbeat) but this cd just left a bad taste in my mouth... It just doesn't seem like a Blink-182 album. I need my funny, immature ubeat songs too. I say listen it to this before you buy. You might like it, I know i didn't."
5,Blink 182's Best Effort,"In my opinion, this is the band's best effort. While this album has the classic Blink formula of catchy rock hooks and infectous drums, it departs into new ground. This is an album that sees Blink develop from pop-punk into the alternative fray. with songs Like Obvious and I Miss You, you can clearly see an attempt at crafting songs that aren't the usual playful formula that they have applied in the past.For what it's worth, I wasn't disapointed by this record, I celebrated the band's departure and evolution. I Highly recommend this record to any returning Blink fan or anyone who enjjoys a good alternative record."
5,The new Blink,Though it does not sound the same as the rest of Blink's albums it still has that Blink-182- touch. I really loved this album. I have been a fan of thier music since the beggining and if I must say this is thier best album so far. I highly recommend it to others who are wanting to buy this album. They have done things with the music in this album that they have never done and that many artists have not done. So there it is my thought of this album. Everyone should buy it!
3,Blink 182 gone Emo,"To me it just sounds like Blink 182 is trying too hard to join the new Emo revolution that's taking over desperate 13 year old girls that enjoy crying about pointless drama.There's no more funy lyrics, no more cleverness in their songs, just dead out pain.My message to the guys of blink: stop while you're ahead of the next album."
2,New sound is dissapointing!,"The first song, Feeling this, is the best song on the CD because the chorus has a little bit of their punk roots. However, the rest of the CD is not so great because I spend the whole time figuring out what kind of band they are trying to be. Blink 182 has come out with some awesome CDs in the past but this one is really dissapointing because they have completely gone away from Punk. But if you don't like Punk to begin with, this may be the CD for you!"
2,this is boxcar racer,"I'm gonna agree with joe on this one, enthusiastically. There are about 3-4 good songs on this and mr. hoppus is in everyone of them. This cd has completely lost touch with all of there others, almost every song is extremely slow, and some of the chorus's and versus' are just plain bad. This sounds much more like a boxcar racer cd than anything. Slow doesn't mean bad, their previous albums had great slow songs like addam's song and stay together for the kids, but these are just plain bad. It doesn't help that tom takes lead vocals in probably 10 of the 14 songs. Number 12 ""all of this"" is a joke. I wouldn't recommend buying this album, since you've already heard the best song from it on the radio. I believe blink has lost all touch with who they were and all the frieken pink on the cover of the album pretty much sums up how bad this album is."
5,Great Album :-D,"Words can't even begin to describe this album. I've listened to Blink 182 for so long now. All their albums are great. I believe every artist and band have different facets to them. Its just human. Its up to the fans to like it or not. No one is really forcing you to listen to it. Blink 182 has songs that no other Punk bands can even touch. Their music is just truly amazing. Theres no substitution. Nothing else can come close.But just to say if you truly are a Blink 182 fan, you'll love this album. It shows a more serious side to Blink 182 so... More hearfelt songs.Listening to Blink 182 for so long, has helped through alot of things. I truly thank them.I just have to say it again, if you are a true Blink fan, get this album... every track is great. Especially ""Feeling This"" ""Violence"" ""Stockholm Syndrome"" and also ""I'm Lost Without You"""
3,disappointment,"A part of me died when i listened to this cd. Read the review 2 reviews up and it does a good job summing up the cd. I loved blink 182 their music was a huge part of my life. I'm sad, so very sad."
2,Worst Blink Album Yet,I got home from school today and I realized that the new Blink album came out today. I went and bought it and it was the worst 10 bucks I could of spent. This album shows the mature side of blink who are obviously trying to be more like boxcar racer. Clearly Blink is a whole lot better with a pop punk sound than a crying emo sound. I would reccommend to maybe download a couple of the songs first to see if you like it because I am sorry I spent money on this crap!!!
4,it was good,i really loved this cd. it was really good. the song i miss you is very different but its still my favorite!!!!
2,This CD = Pure Dissapointment,"I've been a big fan of blink ever since I heard Damnit (Growing Up) on the radio, and I must say this album has been the biggest dissapointment since that day. I was told by a few people that this CD was awesome, but I couldn't agree less. In art, let's say you wanted to make a sculpture, and by doing this, you decide to make it out of pop cans, bike chains, and old car parts. Metaphorically, this album is nothing but that. Just a sculpture of junk. The guys in blink have definately strayed from their roots and adopted new styles. I know this means growing up, (notice the irony) but the fun of blink's music before was that it poked fun at the idea of growing up in the least serious way possible. I know this is a turning point in blink's career, but at this point, I feel that they have turned away from their roots, and if they abandon their roots altogether, I will be the first to abandon them."
3,Billy Whiteshoes,"The sound of this cd should come as no surprise to Blink fans. I had this feeling when I heard their side project works under BoxCar Racers. However, Im not bashing the cd. I just want to bash all of those ""PUNK ROCKERS"", who think Take Off you Pants and Jacket is their best cd. This might apply to you for two reasons. You were not old enough to listen to them. Or the fact that listening to punk music was not considered mainstream and cool then.Well, all hope is not lost...you can still purchase the old cd's and pass it off as if you heard them before. Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch are what you need.As for this cd listen to Here's your letter...or...All of this."
4,"different, but im ""feeling it""","Blink 182 self titled album is much more mature compared to the older albums they have produced. The new sound at first I didnt like but after awhile it grew more and more. If you have heared the single feeling this, you shouldnt judge your opinion of the album on that one song, thats one of two song that sound like their older hits, the other being asthenia. my favorite song would have to be violence, but all of them are good to listen to, there isnt really any that i dont like. Some of their previous songs are better but thats why i gave it a 4 instead of a 5, oh well."
4,Welcome Surprise,"Highlights:Miss YouDownStockhom SyndromeFeeling ThisGoBlink 182 has finally grown up. When I bought this album, I figured it would be the same ol' Blink, who had been churning out funny (but pretty bad) music. Well, on this album Blink has finally matured into a good band. Feeling This is one of their best songs ever. And gone are all the humorous/joke songs that were present on past Blink albums (remember I Wanna F*** a Dog in the Ass?). This CD is pure music--and good music at that. Even if you hate Blink, I encourage you to pick up a copy of this album. You might just be surprised at how good it is."
2,nothing great,"Well, im not a fan of blink 182, but my friend bought this cd and i asked him to burn it for me just so I could see what it was like. Now I've heard plenty of their older stuff, outside the singles, as my friend is really into blink, but to me theyr nothing special, and they got famous for saying curse words in theyr songs. But theyve sorta matured in this album. I dont like more than half the songs on this album, theyre too poppy(in fact the only song I like is the one with Robert Smith because I love the Cure) but I can see a pop-punk fan loving this cd. I dunno, im gonna stop rambling on about this, it probly doesnt even make sense, but I hope y ou like it."
4,"A bit different, but still good.","Yes, Blink-182 has become a little more serious in their songs, but still have a punky vibe. ""All Of This"" and ""I'm Lost Without You"" are both dramatic, slow songs. ""Obvious"" is about an ex-girlfriend that is now with another guy. ""Feeling This"" is, I think, the only song that resembles what their old stuff was like.There are still some great songs on this album. Two of the CD's singles, ""I Miss You"" and ""Down"", are two of my favorite songs on the CD.Of course, nothing on this CD can compare to songs like ""First Date"", ""What's My Age Again"", and ""Stay Together For The Kids"", but I still encourage you to get this CD if you're a Blink fan, or even if you're new to the punk rock scene."
2,Dissapointing,I was looking forward to this cd for months but it is a huge dissapointment. it is compleatly different from all their other stuff. it has a boring title. it is way more hard rock wich is bad. i was afraid that it would happen. i hope they go back to their old style on the next cd but i doubt it will.
2,disapointing,"i bought this cd and i was so excited to get home and throw it into my cd player. on came ""feeling this"". good song, kinda catchy. the rest of the cd just SUCKED!!! i thought this would be some kickass cd. boy was i wrong. the only good songs are ""feeling this"" ""violence"" and ""asthenia"". the wrest of the songs are just not blink 182. they have completely changed thier attitude if you ask me. what happened to the ""I wanna f*** a dog in the a**"" attitude. they have become this angry pissed and depressed punk band. actually, thier not really punk rock anymore. thier not really any genre of music anymore. and i thought enema of the state was bad. too bad they cant make a dude ranch part 2. that would be awsome. dont buy this. i beg you. save your money for a britney spears cd or something worth it. peace."
5,THIS ALBUM ROCKS,"i swear to god this album is the BEST!!! its kinda like box car racer but still the songs are like whoa~ i love feeling this and other songs like down, obvious,and heres your letter. if ur thinking 'bout getting this u shud hurry up!!"
4,Worth A Second Glance,"I went into this Blink cd not knowing what to expect. My friends all said it sounded at lot more like Box Car Racer, and solidly emo, but, still, it's hard to know what to expect. After having listened to it thorougly, I can only recommend that you don't view this disc in light of Blink's past efforts. The humor is still here, but it's darker, and more intimate. It's worth picking up for any emo fan, just to show that Blink is looking to be on the right track. The music is getting away from the simplicity of their past work, and that's one of this disc's most appealing aspects. If you're a die hard Blink fan, this might not appeal to you, but for those turned off by the pervasion of the recent albums, check this release out. It's definetly worth a second glance."
4,Change isn't alwasy the best solution,"I've been a big time blink fan for quite some time now, and when i first heard the new album, i wasn't compleatly bawled over. I miss the stupid things they used to throw in as lyrics and the fast paced songs off dude ranch, chesire cat and buddha. After buying and compleatly listening to the new cd, I came to like it a lot more than i thought i would. Although the new album is more serious, i still love hearing lyrics and Tom's sexy voice."
4,Blink-182,"Lets get the obvious stuff outa the way...this is not your average Blink cd. They have become more alternative than punk, but thats not a bad thing. They also have matured too, and thats probably what I'll miss the most about them. They have always been able to make me laugh and for them to be mature is somewhat of a letdown, but I'll get over it a few days. There are some very awesome songs on this cd. Its deffinately worth the price. When I first heard this cd I was about to cry because I thought that I had lost the Blink that I had once loved so much, but then after a few listens this album grew on me and I loved it. While it is far from the greatness of ""Dude Ranch"" its still good. Easily their worst, but still pure greatness. And for their worst to be this good you know they Blink-182 is a great band. Stand out tracks are: ""Stockholm Syndrome"" ""Here's Your Letter"" ""Violence"" ""Easy Target"""
2,Not the same Blink,"This album is not like the Blink-182 you've heard on previous albums, I don't like it, there's only few songs that sound like Blink-182."
5,Blink -182 self titled CD,"This CD is a completeley new approach for Blink, and I for one think that despite the lack of humor, it is one of thier better CD's."
5,blink-182 Rawks!,The new blink album rocks! That is all that needs to be said! They made a necessary change for the better!
4,Its really growing on me ...,"When i first heard the new album i thought wtf and turned it off after the 4th song to go riding. A few days later i put the CD back on for a laugh just to see how crap it really was, and much to my amusement it didnt seem as bad. i continued to listen to it a few times over the next few days and it really started growing on me, its now 2 weeks later and it has only left my CD player a few times for Funeral for a Friend. I guess i just thought it would be another ""happy go lucky"" summer pop-punk album all over again but seemed alot more mellow which after ajusting too, seems really good. i think the album is one of their best yet and i cant wait to see them live at Hammersmith Apollo in February. Well done lads."
5,As they get older.... they get better,"Blink 182 definitely did it again with this self entitled cd. I was skeptical about it,thinking that nothing could beat their previous Take Off Your Pants and Jacket but this surpassed my expectations. You can tell instantly that the album has an older and more mature tone. The music behind it is also different, showing their evolution as artists. The songs are more complex and deal with a variety of topics from love and sex to being in space. Overall I think this album is amazing and recommend it to any Blink 182 fans or people just looking for something new to listen to."
2,"i dunno, man","When I think blink-182, I think fart jokes, songs that consist entirely of swear words and talk about [...]. I don't think slow, emo-sounding music that depresses me. When I got the newest blink-182 cd, I can't even tell you how disappointed I was. This is not the blink-182 that I love. When I listen to them, I want to laugh. I like the idea of Dysentary Gary being my favorite song from Enema of The State. I love listening to a song and hearing ""your mom's a [...]."" With titles and lyrics like these, you can't help but laugh. Everybody talks about growing up and says you have to do it sometime. Why? Obviously, people enjoyed the image these guys had before. Why did it have to change? Don't get me wrong, the cd was pretty good. However, I would appreciate it a million times more had I heard it from some new, up and coming band. Not from the three immature guys I fell in love with 7 years ago."
5,music changes,"music is not some unbendable, concrete figure, it's the thoughts and feelings of a certain group of people that have found a way to express it through neatly thought out words and tunes. so to say this CD sucks because they are a joke and immature.. then you must not have listened to the CD. this CD is the MOST mature, it has love songs and i guess some people would call ""emo"" songs but still has that fun Blink side to it. if you are a blink fan, you will enjoy it. it's just a little different. i love I Miss You and I'm lost without you, it lets you hear another side of them. for people that think they're horrible and immature and crazy sounding, you would think they would like this CD. it's got something other than crazy punk, but still has that side in there too."
4,Change is hard,"Obviously, for these young Blink fans. I will admit, I've never been a fan of the band until now. I thought, back in the day, that their music was cute and fun. But then they got older, and they were still making songs like First Date and that got on my nerves hardcore. Sooner or later everyone grows up, and apparently that has happened to Blink-182. Thank god. I never expected the maturity of songs like I Miss You or Stockholm Syndrome from these guys, but it's quite a nice surprise to discover that they can indeed be serious. The fact that they also have Robert Smith on this album also kicks some serious booty. I feel sorry for all these kids who can't let the old Blink go. They are the reason most bands can't make a creative leap, and I think it's great that this band was so courageous in making a pretty radical shift in tone."
5,Excellent,"This album is a huge step forward for BLink 182. Gone are the joke songs, juvenile humor, and in their place are some surprisingly good songs. Feeling This is excellent, and in my opinion, one of their better songs. The rest of the CD is also excellent. If you are a fan of Blink you'll definately want to pick this one up. And for all the Blink 182 haters: give this album a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,Blink-182,"Blink have had the same style since they started all the way up to this record. Audiences (mainly teenagers) could easily relate to their lyrics about school, girls, and typical problems that teens face. with this record however, Blink have definetly tried somthing different. The songs are more serious and the pop-punk sound we're used to from previous Blink records is gone. Most of the songs sound more like alternative-rock than punk, both music wise and lyric wise. Tom sings most of the songs and has a very serious tone. Its hard to relate to most of the songs because of their complex lyrics. This would have been a great Boxcar Racer record, but its a below-average Blink record. Changing their style was not a good idea."
2,Blink has finally totally GONE EMO,"I remember the first two blink albums were both so good, they were considered ""pop-punk"", like punk, but not as serious. Then they released ""enema of the state"", which made them superstars, and even though they started to lean a little more towards a growing genre of music called ""emo"", they stilled stayed true to their loud, fast punk roots. Then they released one of the worst albums of all time- ""take off your pants and jacket"", on this they openly embraced emo on songs like ""stay together for the kids"" and ""what went wrong"". Now, they have finally deserted their punk roots and gone to the worst musical genre of all time!"
2,Blink on Valium?,"I am a huge fan of blink, but what the hell is this? If I wanted to fall asleep I'd listen to Sarah McLachlan. When I pop in blink, it's because I want to get pumped up and laugh at the world. It's like summer at the beach on CD. This is certainly not the album for that. This is the ""I'm scared, lonely, and depressed"" blink. There are no songs like ""Voyeur"", ""Reckless Abandon"", or ""Don't Leave Me"". Maybe they aren't having fun as much as the past, because they sure aren't singing about it. Perhaps someone got a synthesizer for Christmas, because piano and violins are largely present now. And what's with the depressing chick reading a love letter? There are some exceptions, like ""Feeling This"" and ""Here's Your Letter"", but by in large it is the most mellow blink album to date. I never thought I'd use the word ""mellow"" to describe Blink-182.Perhaps the album is called Blink-182 to remind you just who it is you're listening to."
3,Well well well,"I went to the story and bought two CD's The Distillers ""Coral Fang"" amd blink 182's new one. I payed $3.00 more for the Blink 182 than the Distillers. When I got home I listened to both and thought the price should have been the other way around! Blink sucked compared to The Distillers. I checked out a few songs on Coral Fang before I bought it. I wish I did that on Blinks 182's because I might never have bought it. I really like Blink 182 and i am a big fan, but this new one was a dog. Its an ok CD but I did not think it was worth the money I payed for. more like $9.99"
1,"Wow, they really have changed","and theyve gotten worse. I hated them because they had hardly any talent and sounded like crap. and guess what nothing changed. ok thats a bit harsh, i mean .... they tried."
3,Disappointed,"Now, I am a huge blink fan and am in love with Enema Of The State and Take Off Your Pants And Jacket (5/5 for both I would say) so when I heard they were changing their sound I was disappointed but decided to give it a chance (it's blink, how bad could it be?). So when it was first released I was disgusted with pretty much the entire thing and avoided it until a couple years later. After giving it a thorough listen, it's not all bad but there are a handful of tracks that I skip when listening to this album which isn't normal for a blink-182 CD around me. And even out of the ones I do like, there are only 2 (I Miss You, Always) that I like as much as the songs on Take Off Your Pants And Jacket or Enema. And on another note, I always liked Mark's singing a little more than Tom's but on this album, I think Tom can get pretty obnoxious (Obvious, Violence). Overall this album just didn't satisfy me. Definately preview it and see if it's worth it before buying this one."
2,Meh,"thats all i can say, meh. to start off i dont dislike this cd because blink isnt punk anymore (no one really cares), they just lost there sound. i LOVE there older songs, dammit and such, but this is just not them. if your a big blink fan, id suggest enema of the state or dude ranch instead of this. the only reason i gave it two instead of one is the fist song is good (never listened to it enough to learn song names.)"
5,Oh Cow!,"I totally adore this album! Most people who say that this isn't their best album, but I disagree. My faveourtie songs:1)Always:10/10 (One of those songs I will love for ages.)2)Easy Target: 10/10 (I was singing the chorse for hours.)3)All of this:10/10 (It sounds so sad.)Peep, buy this album!"
4,Different but good,"Blink's newest album definately has a very different sound and feel to it than previous releases, but change can be a good thing. Who wants every album by a band to sound exactly the same. This album is slower than most of their previous songs and their is more variety from song to song than any of their other albums offer. Gone from this album (for the most part) is the fast paced pop punk that we've heard from them before, but there are a couple of tracks like that on this album. As far as the lyrics go, it seems that Blink has matured lyrically and a lot of their songs go beyond the high school level now. You can tell that Blink did a lot of experimenting with different sounds on this album. So, while Blink hasn't followed their same formula with this album, I think they've succeeded by putting out another quality album."
4,Good to great,"This is just a very good album on any level. To be short and sweet, I would just say, you need something you know is going to be good, get it. not perfect, but close."
1,i really miss the old blink,I can't explain what i felt when i listened to the new blink 182 cd. I felt really disappointed. I was used to the old funny punk rock songs full of jokes and awesome sound from all previous cds... and now? what is blink? just some kinda dark pop music... i still laugh today when i hear the mark tom and travis show cd... but now?? what is blink trying to do?? frighten us? this new cd is terrible... i just wish they went back to punk.
1,Blink's Worst CD Ever,"I have been a Blink fan ever since they started putting out albums. Albums such as Dude Ranch or Enema of the State were awesome and later albums such as Take Off Your Pants and Jacket and The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show were great. I don't know what Blink was trying to do here but it went terribly wrong. I guarantee you Blink will be coming out with a sick recovery album soon after this disaster."
5,Great Cd,This Blink cd is by far the best Blink cd from Buddah until now... It's such a great sound and feel for Blink. I really really like it and can't get enough of it!! Number #11 with Rob Smith from the Cure is such a different area of music for Blink it seems... Best song other then Adam's Song and Miss You. Can't wait until the next CD...
5,New Album,"Blink 182 continues to get better with each new album. i thought they couldn't get any better then "" take off your pants and jacket"" but this self titled album totally tops it. I love how they through some different styles of music into their album, i.e. the fallen interlude"
4,This Cd is a lot different,"The first time I listened to this cd I realized that it is a lot different than Blink 182's previous sound. I got around to more and more songs and I could start to hear the familiar sounds again. After a few listens I could tell it was very similar to Take Off Your Pants & Jacket, with more serious lyrics. If you are Blink fan you should definitly purchase even if you are uninterested cause you will start to think it is a kick ass cd!"
2,liked the old style.......but still an alright cd,"this cd wasnt at all what i was expecting, i was really hoping and looking foward to a cd alot like their previous albums. this wasnt at all what i was expecting i meen if box car racer came out with a new cd and this was it i wouldnt be suprised at all! they really changed styles from a fun pop-punk to more of a serious rock with an emo edge. the only pop-punk style song on the album would be ""feeling this"" and even that song has more of a different style/feeling to it. but i would still recomend this cd, it still has sum good songs on it, like said before, if u were a fan of there previous albums then listen to this with an open mind cuz if u dont it wont be at all what u want to hear."
5,Great CD I give Blink 5 stars!!!!!,"Great cd I love tracks #1,2,3,4,5,6 and the rest are ok but not the greatest songs #6 (Down) is probably one of the best songs on this sweet cd!!!!!!I strongly recommend this cd to anyone!!!"
2,I tried...,"Ok, I'm not gonna quantify my Blink fan status by talking about how long I've listened to them.The first go around on this CD, I thought, hhmmmmm..this is...different.The second time, I was like ...well...it's not too bad.The third time I was like HEY, I'm really digiing this... it's got a good sound.The fourth time around I was like... nice music.. hhhmmm..The fifth time around I was like...hhhhmmm ... now where did I put my NOFX collection?Yep.. five times and I'm already bored of this new CD. Too bad.. I really do like Blink, or at least I did. I'm a fan of catchy, 4 chord punk rock sing along anthems. This album does not feature that at all. Sadly, that Blink has probably left the station on a one way trip to oblivion. If so, I'll just keep on listening to all the other bands who continue making the music I like."
4,new blink 182 album,"i have to admit when i first heard this album i didn't like it at first. then i really sat down and listened to it and the songs grew on me. the band has def. matured yet they are still the fun crazy kids also. i know it took a lot of hard work and time to make this album and after you really listen to the songs you begin to like them. i recommend it to everybody. the album WILL grow on you. i already love a lot of the songs and mark, tom, and travis did a great job! its worth it go buy it now!"
3,not their best cd,"people say that this is their best cd, but that is because they are posers. I am a real fan and have been with the band since the begining, and i still say dude ranch, enema and take off your pants and jacket are the best ones. if you want something everyone likes, get this. if you want real blink 182, get enema or take off your pants and jacket."
4,"Different than the rest but very,very good. (4.5 Stars)","This CD really, really grows on you. At first you may be caught off gaurd by it but then you'll be hooked.1. FEELING THIS- (6): I don't really like this song.2. OBVIOUS- (6.5): Another song that's only okay.3. I MISS YOU- (9): Great song.4. VIOLENCE- (8.5): Another good song.5. STOCKHOLM SYNDROME- (9.5): My favorite song. It's about a woman being away from her significant other because of war. At the end of Violence there is a letter being read.6. DOWN- (8): Pretty good.7. THE FALLEN (INTERLUDE)- (NA): Uses the beat from Down. Catchy.8. GO- (9.5): This is the perfect example of something being short and sweet.9. ASTHENIA- (7): I just like the lyrics.10. ALWAYS- (8): Cool beat11. EASY TARGET- (8): Makes you want to bop your head.12. ALL OF THIS- (8.5): Slow but really good.13. HERE'S YOUR LETTER- (7): Not bad.14. I'M LOST WITHOUT YOU- (9): Another slow song. Good way to end the CD."
2,blink is not like always,worst blink 182 cd .Some songs are good but others they just suck.I'AM a blink 182 fan but I didn't like the album.If you want to listen the true blink 182 cd's buy the enema of the state or take your pantas and jacket.I can assure you that u will like that cd.
3,"Just, well....okay","LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND SAY THEY ""CHANGED UP"" OR ""SOLD OUT"" OR WHATEVER, SIMPLY BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S EITHER TRUE OR NOT (DEPENDING ON YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS BAND). THE POINT IS, I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS A REAL MIXED BAG.BEST TRACKS: FEELING THISI MISS YOUGOSTOCKHOLM SYNDROMEI'M LOST WITHOUT YOUVIOLENCELESSER TRACK: OBVIOUSJUST PLAIN CRAPPY TRACK: THE FALLEN INTERLUDE*AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN*BASICALLY THOUGH, I ENJOYED ""...PANTS AND JACKET"" AND ""DUDE RANCH"" ALOT MORE THAN THIS ONE. AND P.S. IF I WANTED AN ""INTERLUDE"" I'D GO PICK UP AN R&B ALBUM (WHICH OF COURSE, I WOULD'NT)"
2,could this be down hill from here???,"I really respect blink...for what they have done in the past. Their old stuff (punk with a bit of pop) really cought my ear... the songs were fun to listen to and they were up-beat.But what they have come up with on november 18th really pissed me off...three quarters of the songs on the album have a hint of disco-like sounds and 2 or 3 of the songs arent even sung by blink...its horrible.Ever since Travis experimented with the transplants his drumming is tottaly different, i found it was offbeat and i thought he might even have just pulled some of it right out of his butt right then and there. ""feeling this"" and ""I miss you"" are the best songs on the cd, ""Down"" is very repetitive and so is ""Im lost without you"".In conclusion this cd is a big dissapointement, to me and probably other people out there that expected much more from blink than what came out on november 18th.Is this the end of blink we used to know???"
5,An excellent album,"Alright, this album in one word: ""growth"" It may take some getting used to, but anyone who appreciates hard work and musical maturity will enjoy it.The album is very experimental, and the uncoventional methods they used to record really stand out and give the album a very unique vibe.Blink has been my favorite band for a damn long time, 7 years or so, and this is definatly their best release so far. Now I love old Blink, new Blink, serious Blink and funny Blink, I love everything about them, because they are a truly great and talented band. All of you who say they are a different band because they changed their sound, or they dont have jokes and stuff on it, you dont know what youre talking about. You cant expect a band to keep doing the same thing forever, how boring would that be? If you think they have ""changed"", your'e right...they are better now, and they will keep getting better."
4,not as good as previous,"this is an old release, so I coudn't be more behind the curve...not quite as good as previous Blink albums...but that's a difficult act to follow..."
5,Get ready for action!,"Tom, Mark, and Travis knocked this album out of the park. The record is a perfect portrayal of the band's style and ability. When I don't know what to listen to, it is this album I turn to. Not a single song is lacking. If your fan of punk rock or even alternative then you will love this album. Songs like ""I Miss You"", ""Violence"", ""Go"", ""Always"", and ""I'm Lost Without You"" have me coming back to this album again and again."
2,THE END OF PUNK......,"BLINK got many good POP PUNK songs...this one got 3 or 4 good tracks...but this one really shows BLINK goes POP...totally POP....some songs here are totally EMO...if you like PUNK POP you may really enjoy this, but for me it's the clear sign of the end of punk..."
2,Think twice before buying it,"Blink 182 has had excellent cd's but this one has proven to me that they are falling in disgrace. First, there are only three songs that u can listen to completely before switching song. Second, they have very crappy songs such as violence and obvious. Buy any blink cd except this one, i would have given them a 1, but they have 3 excellent songs that saved them from my bad rating. If u are going to buy it, buy the one with the explicit lyrics, the clean one makes no sense (worse than this one)"
3,jlennonfan has serious issues,"Lets get it straight, Blink is not my favorite band and this cd is not great but they are not the worst band by any means. I own all their cds and like most and I think theyre good whether the radio played them or not. No, they arent true punk, theyre pop-punk, but that doesnt mean they suck. This cd has some really good songs and also bad ones. The best is asthenia. Really I just want to say that jlennon fan is a twisted little cry-baby who doesnt get humor. It makes me mad to hear whiny babies talk about what real punk is or not, that dont matter, its whether its good or not. I like to be a positive person so dude, get professional help."
5,Changed My Aspect on Punk Music,"I honest to god do not even listen to the genre of music. My friend I work with put the disc in teh Cd player and i was expecting to be annoyed. However the first 5 songs on this album were so compelling and gripping that I changed my outlook on Punk Rock totally. I can honestly say that ""Miss You"" ""Violence"" & ""Stockholm Syndrome"" are perfect examples of why this CD is awesome. From now on I am a future Blink 182 Fan. Purchase this album, their acoustical talent is brilliantly displayed on this LP."
4,credit,"ok, so the music world has progressed. so what, how boring/how much would you rip them if all their albums sounded like one. Its called getting older. With age comes maturity(sp?), which is what blink 182 have done here. There are still songs to please you die hard ""Punk"" fans, but not so much a punk, but a post punk feeling. This is probably my favorite so far of all the blink albums. Plus Robert Smith(The Cure) provides guest vocals, that rules."
4,ROCK ON TRAVIS,"The new blink CD was somewhat of a disappointment...yet there are good things to be said about it. The thing that should be said first is that nobody can top Travis Barker. He is what makes the band...he doesen't try to show off too much but he shows just enough of what he's made of for people to say wow.There were a few decent songs on the CD...Feeling This, I Miss You, and Down. I'm Lost Without You starts off great I thought but then just drags and drags...its horrible.They are good musicians but don't fill their potential. Travis does all he can and that is enough to keep people listening to them. Change is a good thing, but I think they should go back."
3,not their best,"Old Blink 182 fans, be prepared for a new 'maturer' direction in their music. It's a shame that in my opinion they don't pull it off. They're better off as the childish 20 somethings we know. They try to overcomplicate stuff and in my opinion, it doesn't work(Violence, Not Now). However, there are some good elements of the album,which are reminiscent of the old Blink 182 (Always, Down, I Miss You, Feeling This). Furthermore, i wouldn't recommend this to new-comers to Blink 182. Instead try their Greatest Hits to fully appreciate their sound."
2,BLINK ROX....but dis doesn't,"I am a big fan of blink n i'm realli loyal 2 dere music but dis album realli didn't impress-followed by their break-up it realli wasn't a surprise as they'd lost their ""vibe"". It's not a bad album i just think blink has gone a bit soft n lost their characteristic ""edge"" hey but keep listenin 2 dere old albums as i always say THEY ROCK!!!! Rock on blink!!!!"
1,softcore pop fluff,"these guys are so punk i can hardly stand it. when you babies that listen to this garbage grow up and can handle real punk, pick up some Condemned 84, 4-Skins, Exploited, Templars, and Skrewdriver. Blink 182 would wet their pants if they had to play with any of these bands. Skinheads rule, Oi!"
1,..... no defintaley not,"I love blink 182 beacause im either an 11 year old girl or person who is mixing up their music genres. im glad this boyband with guitar thing is finally dying down a bit. I mean come on it cant last for ever can it?unfortuatley i had to listen to this crap for most of my life because sucky bands get major record deals , and totally kill what punk used to be... why do sucky bands get major record deals you ask , because kids are stupid and will listen to anything.Here are my suggestionsThe sex pistolsDead kennedysDropkick murphysRamonesThe ClashThe misfitsunless of course you actually are already completley brainwashed and like listening to pop music."
1,"No, No, No, No, No, No!","This is the worst by far...It's funny because i heard Enema Of The State and thought""this is as bad as they can get."" Then i heard Take OffYour Pants And Jacket, and i thought ""Okay, this is as badas they can get"" and then i hear this; and it just depressesme.Where's the good Blink182, you know... Cheshire Cat, Buddha,and Dude Ranch? Ya... the band that was at least remotelytrue punk music...Blink182 officially sells out with this CD,congratulations."
1,where did blink go?,"Blink was a great poppy band to listen to when your in a good mood and feel like dancing. THIS THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD.i am so dissapointed. If you want to buy this cd, dont. Save your money and Download the only good song ""feeling this"". BUT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
5,Ka-ching!,ha ha they made an awesome album here... i cant beleive hwo good it is... they are gonan make millions of this album.. this album is so wicked... i personally think #3 i miss you is the best... well bye this cd trust me its worth it!
4,Awesome,"This cd is packed! It has slow songs fast songs, and everything inbetween. So what if it's not like other blink cd's? it still kix ass."
4,VERY SURPRISING,"I've never been a big fan of Blink-182, every album they released was pretty much the same but they had catchy songs. What a shock! I'm a fan of U2, R.E.M., Live & others and this is a great album. There's actually DEPTH to many of these songs, lyrically & musically. I NEVER thought I'd say that about this group. It took them over 10 years, but they've finally grown up. For you wanting the old music, listen to the old records. It's about time this group EVOLVED and made an album that I would consider their first artistic album ..."
5,GREAT CD,this cd is preaty good i think(best blink 182 album) to me lolmostly every song is good on herethere is nothing more to say exceptGO GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,hm....,Ok...i tryed to like this cd...i stopped like Blink 182 like 3 years ago but i tryed to like this cd but i just couldnt...they used to be a annoying pop/punk band but now they sound like another emo band...the song with the guy in the cure is awsome though...if u like emo type stuff or a fan of blink 182 then youll like this but just listen to Cheshire Cat because that cd is the best blink cd there is. The good thing about the cd is that the writing is a bit better...thats why I gave it 2 stars but there just average emo lyrics.
5,Best Yet,"This new CD is awesome,in my opinion the best Blink CD yet.While some people complain about not having any joke tracks,I think its better without them they wouldnt fit.This CD ahs a more mature and serious theme and in my opinion it shows that the guys of Blink have ""gornw up"".All else i have to say os BUY IT!!! you wont regret it."
5,Best album yet,This is by far there best album. A completly new sound for them and it WORKS!!!!!! Pick up this album you won't regret it.
4,blink is awesome,This cd is sweet. In my opinion this is the best blink-182 album that they have done
5,Best Blink Yet,"Blink 182's newest CD, untitled -not self titled, is not your usual blink 182 'fast-explicit-punk' music, but if your a fan you will agree this is the best Blink album yet. From the second song on the album, through the last song, you will notice that the boys of blink have matured their music style, as well as their language- there is far less swearing and more tasteful lyrics. They obviously spent much more time in the studio on this album, and thought out the lyrics ahead of time. Also showing maturity for the album is the use of outside sources in their music; one song, entitled ""Stockholm Syndrome,"" starts off by a woman reading a letter from her husban who is away at war, nother song has clips from a NASA flight, and the lead singer from The Cure sings on the CD with choruses by Tom. This is such an amazing CD and i reccomend it 100%. I gave it 5 stars!"
5,Finally back to the basics,This new album is great... The sound of this album is similar to buddah and chesire cat albums. It is alot harder and a bit darker then the past few albums ive been a fan since day one and they still got me. I have not been able to take this cd out of my cd player since i bought it. if ya dont have it you need to get it now.
2,I love blink but this album SUCKS!,"As other people have said I am the biggest fan of Blink-182. I love all their albums before. Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) was like a whole new generation of blink-182. Every song rocked. But now this album, there's only one good song and that's ""Feeling This."" Every other song i couldn't stand. The enhanced cd is kinda cool but this cd is a major blow and I hope it doesn't affect Blink. Sorry blink, but this album sucks and i hope the next album won't be!"
5,Cool Tunes man,"You know, truethfully i did not like this CD at first but for some reason i still kept listening to it, then it was like, damn, this CD does kick major arse!!! its a must buy!!"
5,What makes a good artist?,"Someone who can write their own tunes to a specific genre and have an audience follow it, that makes a good artist but to write one's own tunes in a number of different styles and have fans follow it religeously regardless makes a great artist. Blink 182 have hit top with their new album showing that they have infact experienced life and its ride. We all began to think that Blink could only do one thing - sing about teenage sex. With their new album we see that a growth, a positive one with hope to continue. ""Easy Target"" and ""Go"" keep their old style but there is now depth whereas ""Stockholm Syndrome"" and ""I Miss You"" are deep and leave one to stick it on repeat to listen again. So put Blink-182's ""Blink-182 in your CD and LISTEN people!"
4,Hard to find,A true 8x8 pan is hard to find. After looking at what was available online I decide to purchase this on after reading other reviews. My mom loves the pan. It cooks evenly and cleans up nicely.
1,Wilton Preferred 8x2 pan,"I purchased this based on reviews. Had I seen this pan in a store, I would not have purchased this piece of tin. I baked brownies in it for the first time and I had to chisel them out with a plastic spatula. The pan is now scratched up. After this experience, I wondered if the right Wilton product was sent to me. I have an oven that bakes perfectly. I really should send this to the Wilton Company in Illinois, even though this was manufactured in China."
4,Nice Pan,"These are fairly good quality pans, have straight sides, and perform well. My only cojplaint is that they are made in China (well, as is everything these days). They do the job."
2,Only Karajan completists need apply,"This is by far the weakest of Karajan's 4 (!) recorded Beethoven cycles. The performances and orchestra are rather bland, and the sound quality is quite bad, with significant tape hiss and muddled frequency ranges throughout -- perhaps if this were 20-bit remastered to current standards, it would be more competitive. Only recommended for those who *must* have all 4 of Karajan's sets -- it's not truly terrible, by any stretch, but it's mediocre, and at this price you can do far better elsewhere.If you're looking for a ""vintage"" (1940's or earlier) Beethoven set, try Furtwangler (my personal fave), or perhaps Toscanini. For beginners who just want to hear Karajan's Beethoven, stick with his middle 2 cycles -- both the 60s and 70s sets are outstanding."
5,Candidate for the best US female pop singer,"Eleni is incredible, a true candidate for the best US female pop singer. Fabulous songwriter, phenomenal voice, beautiful guitar playing, completely engaging live shows. A totally gorgeously inflected singing voice, full of depth and little quirks. This album is her only alt-country album and it's a top contender for best-ever alt-country album. What a singer! Stunningly innovative, on par with Rank and File, or Lone Justice. Not your grandma's country music. Remember, she started out in punk (although her newest material is in the Norah Jones category of jazz-pop). I don't particularly love the old punky stuff of hers (harsher than Rank and File), but everything after that period is just awesomely good. Try to see her at a live show too, especially in smaller venues, where her charming personality really comes through. Top song of the album: ""Iowa City."""
2,Depends on Your Kids,"The book was well organized, but if one's children are active boys between the ages of 5 and 11, then this book is probably not for you. Although there were a few exceptions, I found that the book was filled with museums, which may be interesting, but did not seem too exciting upon reading. I also ordered with this book, ""Tokyo for Free"" and ""Little Adventures in Tokyo"". Between these two books and a good guide book, everything in this book was covered with the advantage that there were things in these other books that seemed like alot more fun. Depends on your kids."
5,i'm in love with anna moffo,"i can't stop listening to this cd -- over and over and over again -- for the past...four, five months -- i'm hooked -- addicted -- can't get enough -- just incredible -- sends me to the heavens -- and back againit's her fault (because of this cd) that i'm learning the aria 'vedrai, carino'; next up, 'caro nome' -- and i'm a guy -- i just wish i could hit the high notes -- a tenth as high...as she does -- such beauty, such precision, such smoothness -- lovely...beautiful -- such words...are too little to saythe lucia...is out of this world -- sixteen minutes and sixteen seconds...of pure magicand i haven't heard cuts nine through eleven, in full -- they're scratched, on my copy of the cd -- can't wait...to hear them, in full"
4,Thriller ... in physics??? Great summary of WWII physics/inspiring courage of Norwegians.,"Kurzman presents best case I have ever seen on details of importance of heavy water, methods of production, rate of production/levels of enrichment of heavy water, etc. Beauiful explanation/rationale of necessity of blocking Nazi access to heavy water. Text needed a ""physics editor"" to correct technical errors which mar an otherwise excellant tale of history. Brilliant writing...real page turner. Engaging discription of personalities and character of Norwegians, their battle against tyranny, love of life, country and great out-doors. Even more engaging than tale of sinking of the Indianapolis ... no easy task, but accomplished gracefully. For the layman, history of ear;y bomb-physics is not often presented in so clearly and informative a manner."
5,Inspiring and thought provoking...,"This is an amazing documentary. The time, care and respect that the filmmakers obviously took in the making of this piece is evident throughout. A love of storytelling combined with a deep love of history makes for an truly engaging, informative and provocative film. I love this film! It has rightfully earned a place in my all time top ten favorite docs!Thank you to the filmmakers for telling this important story!"
5,Is this a cover-up?,I saw this video on PBS and was amazed at the story it tells. It is trully a great story and should be seen. I now see that Amazon says it has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Am I paranoid to think that this is a conspiricy to cover up the blatent racisim of this country?
2,dont buy this book.....buy POCKET KNIFE TRADER'S PRICE GUIDE VOLUME 8,"Well its a typical price guide. The values in it are way overinflated and none of the knives actually bring that much money. It is also missing prices for several highly collectible knives.The Case XX section of this book is kinda difficult to find what you are looking for.If you are thinking of buying this book then dont, I would recommend POCKET KNIFE TRADER'S PRICE GUIDE VOLUME 8 it is much easier to figure out and has actual prices and it is cheaper. It is also fresh off the presses and is written by a group of people who are directly involved with Case and Tony Foster who knows everything about knives."
4,More pocket knife mania,"I wanted a book to help me identify a bunch of pocket knives I had acquired and what they might be worth. This book helped me do that quite easily and I would recommend it to anyone with similar goals. ""The standard knife collectors guide"" by Ritchie and Stewart was also of equal value.I would have liked to have seen more color photos and fewer copier quality pictures but the process was good enough to do what I needed. This book made it easier to discern differences among similar knives because of the detail that was included in knife types."
2,Very dull,The book is not well written. I have several books on WWII and the Germans. There is not riviting plot or an gripping passages I seen. I put the book down by chapter 6.
2,Yawn of a Yarn,"This effort fails to live up to the promise that Keizer's first WW2 novel displayed. Thrillers are supposed to thrill. This book doesn't. The long tedious descriptions of uninteresting characters serve only to break up the unemotional dialogue and by-the-number action pieces that pop up occasionally. The protagonist might be the least-interesting main character I've read about in quite some time, and the villains are even more boring than the protagonist. In a WW2 thriller there should be Nazis to root against, but the SS-members depicted here are not threatening.This is a great book to read when you're trying to induce sleep. If you want excitement, try Greg Iles ""Rising Phoenix,"" or even Keizer's first book."
1,Not what I expected!,"I'm sure this toy would be good for older kids, but alas, the age for the user wasn't specified on the item page. I bought the item according to my child's weight and shoe size. Not exactly a great toy for a 3 year old, maybe for someone much older and more stable. I saw a broken leg or ankle waiting to happen with this, so I sent it back!"
2,not as much fun as it looks,Bought this for my daughter (age 9) for Christmas. She has barely used it - not as jumpy as it seems and just very little interest in playing with it overall. Disappointing. Might just be her - maybe others would have a blast with it.
1,This was not the book it is the script of the play,I thought this was the book but it wasnt it was the script from the play. So if that is what you want then order this but dont expect a nice long book to read. This has what to do on stage and when to dim the lights and curtain and tells you about how to do the stage. It also has the play itself with instructions to the actors.I thought it was the book I have heard about but it isnt. I wish I knew ahead of time and just waited for the movie since it will be word for word. I guess you could use this book to talk with the movie. But this isnt the original book!
1,Very fragile and flimsy.,"The idea is good, but this pinhole camera is VERY flimsy and VERY fragile. The rubber band that works as the shutter spring broke after just two rolls and the winding crank broke after only one roll.No, I would not recommend this to my friends."
1,Sunbeam Hair Dryer piece of junk!,This was my second Sunbeam Wall Mounted Hair Dryer. First one lasted just over one year. This last one lasted only 11 months! No More!!!
3,Fan shattered after probably 30 uses,This dryer came mounted in our motorhome. After probably 30 uses the fan shattered. Out of warrenty so they won't replace. Wouldn't buy again.
4,Works Great,Easy to mount and works great. Consider the upgraded model if you want a night light and clock.
2,2 strikes and yer out,"I just threw away my second Sunbeam wallmount hairdryer. The first one lasted 2 years. The second one, 2 months. Buy it if you enjoy flareups and sparks...and buying lots of hairdryers."
5,She loved it,Got this for my wife in addition to some chocolate last Valentine's day and she still sleeps with it. It's a really great stuffed animal.
2,Glazed-over Jesus. Robert Powell on downers?,"The biggest turn off for me in watching Jesus of Nazareth is the glazed over eyes, slow ""righteous"" speech patterns that Powell and many others continue to do in these types of films. Come on Hollywood these were real, historical people in extroardinary situations not bleary eyed monsters from b-movies! The demon possession scene-Jesus had an echo/reverb-effect on his voice, interesting use of something unecessary. The best film on Jesus is still the one called ""Jesus"" by Campus Crusade starring Brian Deacon. Avoid any of the earlier Jesus films with Ed Wynn, John Wayne, Telly Savalas and even a young James Dean as John. I could've sworn I saw John Wayne pull a six-shooter on Pontius Pilate. Please correct me if i'm wrong."
1,Historically Inaccurate,"Very disappointing. You would think director Franco Zeffirelli and his cast of many gifted actors and actresses could stay true to the real story. What starts off decent enough transforms into six hours of very liberal interpretation. Why toil to the actual locations without honoring the documented details? For those who will never open the bible to read the story for themselves, this will only confuse anyone who is earnestly trying to learn anything about the greatest story ever told. They should have just called this ""Jason of the desert."""
5,DVD,An excellent video on the ministry of Christ! I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. A good annual tradition at Christmas and Easter.
5,Jesus of Nazareth,"This is the best film version of the life of Christ that has ever been made! Much of the script is taken directly from Scripture; but, unlike the Jesus film - which is taken mostly from Luke's gospel - this film is a chronology of all the gospels.Best of all: it doesn't stop with Jesus' burial. Jesus' resurrection is acknowledged and the film ends when He promises His disciples He'll be with them until the end of the age.Unfortunately, the DVD does nothing more than preserve the look of aged videotape. It needs to be restored. It's also not ""complete and uncut"" as the packaging states, since the scene showing the head of John the Baptist on a platter is still missing.However, I recommend this DVD. At least the video quality won't get any worse, and it'll take up a heck of a lot less space on your shelf than the 3-tape video."
4,Review of the DVD,"Based on the quality of the DVD, I would have given it 1 star. The transfer to DVD was awful. Film scratches are evident. Sound quality is very poor. The are few ""extras"". The cast bio section is weak and the biblical history section is hard to read.That being said, this is one of the greatest films ever made on Christ. I might go even as far to say it is the only film on Christ.The strength of the film itself raised this to a 4 star rating. Don't be dissuaded to own a copy of this great film by the poor quality of the DVD. Maybe someday it will be digitally remastered. But why wait until then."
5,Jesus of Nazareth,"Best and most accurate depiction of the Gospels. Robert Powell's portrayal is incredible. In comparison to other cinema attempts (including Mel Gibson'd) this six-hour review of the Gospels hits all the milestone events. A ""must see"" for all ages."
1,Jesus of Nazareth - A 'Knock-Off'???,"I have seen this movie a number of times in its Original Format.Both copies I was provided with by Amazon.com show unmistakable signs of being a forgery, even though both were 'sealed'.The first copy (returned) disk #1 was a mess!; the second copy, while in better - seemingly new condition - was heavily edited. I confirmed this by watching a network presentation and comparing it to my 'New - Sealed' copy.NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,A Classic Needed Technical Work,"This classic says it was digitally remastered on the back cover. But, it's color wasn't preserved well over the years so the remastering didn't boost the picture quality much. Regardless, it's the best that will exist for this Zeffirelli masterpiece which will unlikely ever be beat."
4,Great film,My husband asked for this film for Easter. It is a wonderful movie about Jesus and the Passion. Several of the actors in this film are also in The Ten Commandments. They even used some of the same costumes.
5,Love Jesus,This is truly on of the best Christian films ever made . So many great performances by an all- star cast . What a blessing to have it part of our collection . Thankyou amazon and thankyou Jesus !
3,revise my previous review - somewhat disappointing,"This disk is said to be dual sided, so two such disks should have the capacity for a six and one half hour program like this. However, the images from this program are very soft (some would say ""out of focus""). This can be partially compensated by raising the detail control on the video display.There are also motion artifacts arising from the preprocessing and the movement of the film in the projector (telecine) gate. These artifacts are not very annoying though."
5,great condition,Another great movie to add to your christian movie collection. Was very happy with the speed of delivery and condition was excellent. Thank u
5,Simply The Best Depictition Ever Filmed!,"I have to admit that as a Christian I am always impressed by how faithfully and carefully this long and well-produced version of teh greatest story ever told is accomplished. The sets are superb, as is the acting and the presentation. The dialogue, which can easily come across as stitlted, seems natural and flows logically as the story builds towards its conclusion.This film represents a loving tribute rendered by a director fanatically devoted to his subject. This is well worth the money and time one has to invest to sit through the six or so hours of the film. I ordered one recently as I lost my original version in a fire last fall. It still moves me as I watched it over the week before Easter. It is a lovely fim. Enjoy!"
3,Jesus of Nazareth,"Great story and acting of course. However, a terrible DVD transfer and little if no attempt to correct artifacts and flaws in the master film/video. Overall. a very big dissapointment as the acting and production is of great value. Truely this could have be much greater!"
5,Jesus of Nazareth,"This story originally aired on t.v. as a mini series. It is probably the best story of the life and death of Jesus I have ever seen. Also, the actor who portrays Jesus looks exactly like the image of him we (Catholics) grew up with. My husband is not Catholic, but when this series aired on t.v. he was enthralled and even though tired from work, he stayed up every night to watch it. It is the only thing we ever watched together that he shushed me if I said anything while watching. I have this on video, but bought it on DVD to make sure I'd always have it. Video tapes may be sensitive to heat and cold, but a DVD is much more durable and lasts years longer."
5,A forever classic movie/story,We watch this every year. I did it before my son and continue the tradition now since it's hard to find these stories on TV now days. A classic that will be with us forever.
4,satisfaction,The dvd had no warnings about country code. first It wouldnt work on my dvd player so i had to purchase a new player just so that the new dvd can be compatible with my player. i tried playing around with the settings but i couldnt change them to suit the dvd
5,Jesus of Nazareth,This is one of my favorite movies of all times! It is definitely worth picking up if you haven't seen it!
4,very good,"sorry, I DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENT,BUT CAN ANYBODY TELL ME WHAT HAPPEN THE THE YOUNG ACTOR LORENZO MONET, WHO PLAY THE BOY JESUS. The database at actors.com don't mention him as if he wer're in the movie. PLEASE,GIVE INFO AND THEN PERHAPS BRING THE SITE UP TO DATE. It seems as if he was intentionally left out. In the gospel of luke the mention of him is brief,but a important part of the gospel this site included people I don't even remember as being in the movie,but I do remember the boy's beautiful voice. END"
4,Good Jesus Film,"This is a good jesus film. I would reccomend this to mostly everyone. But, if you are the kind of person that likes for some things to be true and some not. Than this movie is not for you. But, if you are the kind of person that likes everything to be true than I think you would like this movie. Because everything in this movie are true except for some things in nazarth when he is growing up. I would reccomend this movie for all ages above five."
4,One of the best...,"This is easily one of the finest films based on the life of Christ. Obviously a labor of love for the director and producer, there is great passion in every detail, scene, and moment.The DVD is a beautifully remastered event. So nice to be able to go exactly where you want to in the story. Artisan has done a fine job with this re-release.The only drawbacks? 1) I find Powell's portrayal of Jesus a bit to quiet and laidback--I personally believe that Jesus was much more engaging and affable--why else would so many people have followed Him? 2) The English accents. Since Hollywood first began making Biblical epics, it seems that Brits must always play at least the majority of the major characters. I guess it just sounds better when the King James English comes from British mouths!You won't be disappointed in this one."
5,Great Film for Personal Reflection,"I always saw this classic lengthy film in television when i was young during Holy Week. Marathon show of this film is oftenly done on Good Friday, around nine a.m. and ends around three p.m. Because there are lots of inspirational films and newer versions of this movie nowadays, this film is now seldomly shown during Holy Week.When i saw a DVD copy of this film in a video store, i bought it immediately for my collection. I only hope that the film company who owned it, could release a remastered version someday, with improved sound and film quality,special features, commentaries, as well as subtitles for non-english speaking countries."
3,No CC for hearing impaired as shown in the box,"The box shows that this DVD is Closed Captioned (CC) for the hearing impaired, and it is not... It is not fair to do this..."
4,GREATEST FILM EVER ON THE LIFE OF CHRIST: but the DVD transfer disappointing,"Even after thirty years, Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" remains the greatest film on the life of Christ ever made. I can honestly say watching this film 30 years ago changed my life. I'd easily give it five stars, but the DVD transfer was INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING. As another reviewer said, I felt like I was just watching an old VHS tape (which I already own)."
5,Absolutely Magnificent!,"My 16 year old son had been watching clips on YouTube when he wanted to feel close to Jesus, so I purchased the DVD for him for Christmas. Indeed, this magnificent portrayal of the life of Christ from His Annunciation to His Passion, Death and Resurrection will no doubt rekindle your apprecitation for the mystery of our redemption. No respectable video library should be without this classic."
5,dvd jesus of nazareth,excellent movie about our lord jesus christ to every one who worhsips our lord jesus christ.
1,Very disappointed with the poor quality,"Despite following Amazon's troubleshooting instructions to the letter, the DVDs to this movie kept freezing and skipping. In addition, they appeared to be cheap copies of the original movie. I was very disappointed in their poor quailty and can only hope Amazon will replace them with something that my family and I can watch without any more issues."
2,jesus of nazereth,"The DVD was not full screen, the image and sound quality was poor. The film apparently has not been remastered or improved in any way."
5,Top Shelf Jesus of Nazareth DVD,"I thought I had seen this film before; but I hadn't- this DVD is really a true classic in every sense of the word. The acting by Robert Powell is superb, as is the all-star cast. No home DVD library should be without it."
5,JESUS of Narareth,the movie is a classic and done to perfection. the transaction was great! Reasonable price for such a good movie and fast shipping.
1,Wrong Zone,I have not been able to watch it because my dvd player says it's the 'wrong zone'. what does that mean. Can somebody please explain it to me? I was so looking forward to watching it. You can imagine my dissapointment.
3,DVD a disapointment,"I was thrilled to see this miniseries coming to DVD and preordered it as soon as I knew about it. And it's a fine TV show....but a lousy film. I haven't been able to find out if it was shot on video or film, but if it was shot on film, no expense was wasted on remastering, because there wasn't any. Artifacts all over the place, washed out colors...yuck. SUMMARY: The greatest story ever told, but one of the worst DVD transfers ever!"
1,Jesus of Nazareth,Your promotion didn't say the video was in Spanish which I do not speak. You were going to look into this problem but I have not heard back from you. You should replace the Spanish Video with an English Version which is the original format.
5,The greatest telling of the greatest story ever told,With the exception of the temptation of Jesus by Satan this movie delivers everything needed to tell the Gospel story on a grand scale.An all star cast the delivers over and over again give Robert Powell all the support he needs to pull off this role. Ian Holm (Zerah)and Ian McShane as Judas are positivally brilliant.This movie so dominates the other pictures of its ilk that you should see if AFTER all the others. The others are mostly fine movies but the simply can't compare.A Masterpiece.
1,Have not received the product yet,Have not received it. the tracking says it was a wrong address yet the other items that were ordered with it came with no problem.
5,Jesus of Nazareth,"I am in ministry and have seen many depictions of the life of Christ. This one, by far, is my favorite!"
5,star spectacular,"this movie talks about jesus and how people took hi, as he was there but did not understand him because he was different so they falsely put him to a false trial and killed him.this movis is one i could watch everyday and it puts love into your heart as you realize he went through the almost exact thing we go through every day life,not being accepted because we are different.sad really but he forgives us and he accepts us as he did on this video."
3,Not as biblically accurate.,"This video is not as biblically accurate as I was led to believe by the other reviews. I purchased this to augment my bible study teaching so I may be a little tougher on the movie then most people. Dramatic license is taken in several places because of the need to let the viewer know some of the backround as well as the portraying of the actual incidents in Jesus' life. The movie is already 6 hours long so I can understand the necessity of this but some of decisions by the producer are almost ridiculous. Young Jesus is portrayed by a young man with blue eyes, blond hair, and the whitest skin I've ever seen on someone from the middle east. All in all though, the movie has some cool parts and is worth watching. I would recommend it."
5,The Best Film About the Life Of Jesus Christ,"If you loved the Passion of the Christ, If you are new to the Christian faith, this is the one for you!Franco Zeffirelli brings Jesus Life into your heart and Soul.Let Christ transform you in this breathtaking ,star studded epic."
2,Terrible Transfer,Excellent movie and message no doubt but the film quality is gross. This movie should have been given the highest processing available. I am deeply offended. If you have it on VHS just wait for the blu ray.
5,"""Are you the son of God?""","I was five years old, when I saw ""Jesus of Nazareth"" at first. Since then I saw roughly fifty times. Zeffirelli' movie is really ""The greatest told in the world"". The fascinating Jesus-movie, with fascinating actors, with fascinating Maurice Jarre (the best), and with fascinating Zeffirelli. Robert Powell is the embodiment of Christ.The best Jesus in the filmhistory.(And of course Willem Dafoe) Olivia Hussey (oh my God!)is the perfect Mary.(And She was the perfect Juliet) Rod Steiger as Pontius Pilate is brilliant. Anthony Quinn as Caiphas is powerful. And Laurence Oliver(Nicodemus), and Anne Bancroft(Mary Magdalane), and Michael York(John the Baptist), and James Mason (Joseph of Arimet),and...but!the greatest is Ian Holm as Zerah. Simply gruesome. Zeffirelli, who directed the ""Brother sun, sister moon"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"", made the masterpiece. A six-hours Jesus-biography: wonderful, touching, and large-scale. My second favourite film."
5,Look into the loving eyes of our Savior,"This is my favorite movie rendition of the life of our Savior. As a seminary student I do notice the Hollywood additions and alterations from the Gospels, but these are minor compared to the overall quality of the film.My favorite scene in the movie is when Jesus forgives the woman caught in adultery. The scene has Him talking to her and when He lifts up her face to talk to her they scene switches to be a view from her perspective. You get to look into His eyes as He says to her ""go and sin no more"". The look in the actor's eyes at that moment is amazing. You feel like Jesus is looking and talking to you rather than her. You get to see the pain over our sin yet the love that leads to grace as well. When I think of my Savior, those are the eyes I imagine I'll see someday."
3,Great Movie- weak DVD,"This is perhaps the best movie of the life of Jesus ever made and is a must see, must own. Five stars+ for the movie itself.However, the DVD scan could be better. I hope some time in the future this movie is re-processed and a better scan is relased. Sometimes the VHS tape looks better than the DVD."
3,Jesus of Nazareth,"Great story and acting (of course). However the digital transfer did not even attempt to remedy many or the analog errors of the original. Yes it is probably digitally mastered as advertized but little has been done to improve the quality. So the bottom line is, a good buy if on sale but not a huge must have as no real upgrade to the master has been done."
5,This Movie Is A Classic.,I do not believe that there is or ever will be another movie as great as this one. No one will ever better the role of Robert Powell as Jesus either. To sum it up I will say that this movie is not really something that you watch but rather it is something that you experience. I have seen it more than 20 times and will watch it again soon.
1,No english !,"Unfortunately, this is not in english so I have not played it. There was no notification when I ordered it that it would NOT be in english !!"
3,"Good in some respects, but lacking in others.","Robert Powell's perfomance as Jesus is exceptionally good. Talk about perfect casting! He's under-used, sadly, because this movie spends much more time on the framework and incidentals of the gospels than it does on ""documenting"" the teachings, parables, and miracles of Jesus, so much of that important gospel material is left out. Lots of attention is given to King Herod and his wife, the discussions of the Sanhedrin, the events leading up to the nativity, etc.. It's too bad, really, given that they had such a long movie to fill up! Another problem is that the audio is slightly out of sync with the video in sections, which was really annoying. I didn't find the coloration 'problem' to be as disconcerting as some other reviewers did."
5,Nazareth review,I really enjoyed this movie. Out of the several movies I have seen about the life of Jesus this one is pretty much on as far as the life of Christ is described in the Bible. So it is worth seeing.
5,If you thought Passion of the Christ was too intense try this movie!,If you thought Passion of the Christ by Mel Gibson was too intense Jesus of Nazareth is for you. The message is accurate and it sticks to the Gospel. It's filming location makes this movie a visual masterpiece. And Robert Powell is superb in his role as Jesus Christ.
5,Best story ever of Jesus!!!,"Robert Powell, does a wonderful job of playing Jesus, this is a great classic movie about the real story of Jesus and his disiples!!!! This is a must see movie for all ages, you cant go wrong with this movie!!!!"
4,Excellent adaptation of the Gospels,"Very good adaptation of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John. While made for TV, this is far beyond the usual TV fair. Cast includes many major motion picture stars who deliver some great performances. Weaknesses are a lack of budget for special effects and the movie kind of ran out of steam towards the end. Still, it's well worthy of seeing or owning. Also compare to the ""Gospel of John"" movie made years later."
4,intriguing...but accurate? not always...,"This book has helped me greatly with a Medieval Philosophy class I am taking. However, I sometimes find myself questioning its accuracy. At times the author seems to write his opinions rather than facts. Also, what I found most surprising is Burge claims Peter Abelard to be a nominalist (a believer that universals are simply words and not real). Truly it was Jean Roscelin, Abelard's teacher, who was a nominalist. While Abelard does owe some of the aspects of his viewpoint to Roscelin, Abelard attacked nominalism and his professor with his own belief called MODERATE REALISM (the belief that universals exist only in the mind but hold power because they refer to general and common concepts). OOPS. As for the writing itself, this book flows very nicely, and Burge does a wonderful job of incorporating quotes from the ""first letters"" and ""lost letters"" to paint before the reader a love story that is tragic, intense, and always touching."
1,Masters Degree Necessary,I read all the wonderful reviews of this book and purchased it. I have always been interested in their lives. But this book reads like a college textbook with so many extraneous details of not only them but everyone they ever came in contact with. Your head is so full of dates and important personages that you just want the story of Abelard and Heloise to be come forward and be told.
1,Boring,"I love Edith Wharton and have read many of her books, but this one is just BORING. It goes on and on and nothing ever happens. If the people in it could just be honest with each other instead of lying to try to avoid confronting difficulties the story would have been a lot better and a lot shorter. It is agonizing to read."
2,"""An Odd Format""","This is a very strange format for an Edith Wharton novel--no publication date, no biographical information, many typographical errors. In addition, the cover has nothing to do with the novel.The novel itself is not up to Wharaton's standards with a very strange ending that seems almost as though it was tacked on at the last minute."
4,Moving...,"While ""The Reef"" is to my mind not on par with her other great works, it is nonetheless an entirely worthwhile read. The emotional drama is compelling, palpable, devastating. Altogether engrossing. The descriptive scenes are for the most part not as sharp as they might be, but the power of the novel lies in its dialogue-- in what is said, but more often what is not said. It concerns the inability to express in any meaningful fashion those things that most matter, the agony of non-expression as much as the agony of the primary feelings themselves. I enter, perhaps, too easily into the emotions of what are, after all, only fictional characters, but I was moved to tears by certain passages, on account of the emotional rawness that underlies the attempts to preserve decorum. A good novel, and thoroughly enjoyable."
1,Pompous and grandious,"I am a strong supporter of environmentalism which is why I strongly object to this book. This book only reinforces the impression that environmentalists are self-righteous and out of touch with other humans as well as reality. Instead of referencing current events, or any statistics to support his sermonizing,Berry spends his space name dropping. It is painfully apparant that he is more interested in sounding erudite than remaining coherent. His attempts to sound erudite are undermined by his tendency to reuse words with inappropriate frequency. The book would have been far more effective as a one or two page pamphlet but unfortuantely it was drawn out to be 102 pages of repetition. It is not even on recycled paper."
2,Not as great as the reviews make it seem.,This book is...different. I got it looking for some ANSWERS on how to help our current Earth situation. It gave me ONE that will work. (A waste management idea. Not one I was WISHING for. Not something I can do.) All others were a little too mumbo-jumbo along the lines of holding hands and looking at the stars together. It does offer reasons why our situation must change but is nothing in comparison to Daniel Quinn's works. Read his instead.
1,"Godless, biocentric, and New Age","Thomas Berry promotes a ""new story"" of the universe, also known as the ""Earth story,"" ""Universe story,"" or ""new cosmology."" The new cosmology essentially is a bio-centric, Godless, New Age, and scientific account of creation, rather than a God-centered religious story. Sadly, Berry is widely promoted as a Catholic author, yet there is nothing Catholic about this book. In fact, the book is generally critical of Christianity and Western Culture. During our time of environmental crisis, we need to turn to God, the Creator of the universe. This book will only steer us away. Save your money. There are better Christian faith and ecology books out there."
3,"Interesting views, hard to decipher.","Berry is a humanist, visionary, with much wisdom to impart. His writing is deep and well documented. But it is difficult to slog through each paragraph to get the meaning inherent in the words. Tried as I might I never got through more than the first quarter of the book, then donated it to the local library. Think he needs a co-writer or ghost writer that can translate his thoughts into plain English. It would help the world to have this."
5,One of the better hockey biographies - and a great subject!,"I have read a lot of biographies about hockey players, including Sidney Crosby, and while most are informational, few are what you might call ""page turners"". The Rookie is a suprising exception to that! Richer has done a wonderful job of bringing Sidney's amazing early career to life with the perfect mix of hockey detail and personal account. Some books of this type present material that is second- or third-hand at best but Richer committed to getting the real story first-hand. Her balanced approach to Sid's meteoric rookie season will appeal to hard-core hockey enthusiasts, devoted Sid the Kid fans, and curious people watchers all."
4,Loved it.,"This behind the scenes book about Crosby's struggling, but amazing rookie year is very well-written and interesting. However, I did find myself grimacing over recapping what a terrible season the Penguins had, but in the end I think it was a very fine read."
2,Disappointing,"The voices just weren't up to the job. The orchestra did not tone down its volume, so the singers, already at the top of their range, had to sing at the top of their voices as well. This is a danger with Wagner. I could only listen to the first act. I couldn't bear to listen to any more than that."
3,So-so,"Impulse Records recorded Milt's group during an August 1-2, 1969, engagement at Shelley's Manne Hole and released the results on two LPs; this is the first volume. Teddy Edwards plays tenor and is definitely not having a good night. Ray Brown is featured heavily on TENDERLY, and also on BLUES IN THE BASSMENT, a tune he wrote. Best on the date is pianist Monty Alexander who plays with fire and determination lacking in some of the other players; he is especially noteworthy on WHEELIN AND DEALIN. I'm not sure the second LP ever made it to CD, but it's not any better. Not a memorable outing for these guys."
5,"Brilliant, mesmerizing","Well, it's not really clear that Defoe used actual accounts, though he did draw on much discussion about the Great Plague. He was, after all, only five or six years old when it occured. But the narrative is utterly absorbing. Written by one of the greatest novelists of all time (he was Joyce's favorite English novelist), the narrative is vivid, moving, and sometimes hilarious. It is also remarkably contemporary. You meet quacks and prophets disturbingly similar to the no-nothings who dominate our own time. The descriptions of behavior, disease, fear, and denial are as fresh today, and as relevant, as they were when Defoe wrote the Journal. Don't miss it!"
2,Leave this one for the academics.,I had high hopes for this book but was regretably disappointed. This is not a good guideline for writing a screenplay. Instead I found an acadamic study of the history of comedy that had me skimming soon and often.
2,Self indulgence published.,"I was attracted to this book because I work as a writer and actor mostly with comedy. What a horrible book. Why don't I write down all my favorite movie moments (not just comedy), throw in a few populist tips and bind them together with a whole load of other peoples ideas and....voilá!! I have a book published! That, in my opinion, is what Andrew Horton has done. Terribly self-indulgent and doesn't set up any coherent criteria. Anyone who has done McKees course, read his book or stuff by Sid Field, Christopher Vogler, etc. will not be missing anything by not buying this book. He may offer some useful insights but they are lost in a chaos of useless references. The writer comes across as well meaning and passionate but I found his book frustrating and disappointing."
2,Not the best,"Sorry for my bad English. This is not his best book, but you can find in ""The Photographer"" a Pierre Boulle's leitmotiv : the absurd obsession, that grows up to the drama. A French photographer who has been wounded during the war in Algeria has always wanted to take THE picture and has never been satisfied. But he discovers that one of his friends wants to murder the President. So he decides to help him in order to take a photograph of a dying President. Cynical and nervous but could be more => 2 stars."
2,Not good enough,I brought this blow dryer because I was tired of blow dryers that didnt blow hot enough and needed constant comb replacement. Little did i know That I would only be satisfied with the hotness of it but not the comb.I have replaced the comb 5 times already each of them cost me 6 dollors thats $30 dollors more on top of the price that the blow dryer cost me. So this product could be better. Iam not fully satisfied.
4,Adequate for the less than hard core,"OK sampler. I tended to favor their earlier material and associate their later stuff as a bit too slick, too pop-like and written to score for the top 40 crowd. They didn't ""sell out"" it just made good business sense after they demonstrated their ability to deliver stellar, cutting edge material for its day that still holds its own. Their Crime of the Century and Crisis? What Crisis? LP's (CD's) were by far the best experience for my ears. You can't go wrong with this ""Best of."" However,if you want the full treatment and the continuity of their two masterpiece albums, get the two mentioned above instead of or in addition to ""The Best of"". I can only hope that the production values of the CD versions of these LP's are superior. The LP's suffered from incredibly poor dynamics and were very flat for such potent material."
3,Breakfast in America was the best!,"I orderered the Very Best of Supertramp after debating between Breakfast in America (which I once owned on LP) and the former. I liked the cuts from Breakfast in America the best. I do love this group, though, they are eclectic and they have a very unique sound."
3,Best of Supertramp,CD had quality problem... on one track it will not play properly. Happens in all CD players.
2,missing obvious hits,"While others will appreciate samplings from a wide variety of albums, I have to stop and point out that this is called ""The very best of..."" NOT ""A broad overview of..."". 'Even in the quitest moments', 'Fool's Overture' are obvious hits that did not make it here, whereas songs such as 'Cannonball', 'Rudy', 'Hide in your shell', and 'Crime of the Century', are just so-so songs and not well-known at all. In fact, when I listen to them I'm not sure if I have even heard them before. 'Crime of the Century' was an album title and so is well-known, but critics considered the album and that song to be a real 'crime'!Of course, this is pretty typical of what the music industry does: intentionally holding big hits off a ""best of"" album. I have grown used to it, but that doesn't mean I am ever going to approve of it."
3,"Great Recording, pretty decent album","Hello Sorry to disappoint you all I am not a supertramp fan. Of course I do love songs like From Now On, Goodbye Stranger and Logical. However, the rest of the songs were mediocre at best. I have to say the recording and remastering of this album is so good that I almost wanted to be a Supertramp fan. One can hear the sounds of the symbals in the background and finger snaps so clearly that it feels like it is in the room. Amazing technology!!!!"
3,Great songs,"The best songs are ""The Logical Song"" and ""Bloody Well Right."" Although most are in stereo, it's sort of hard to tell, unless you fiddle with the balance switch or listen really carefully. The piano and keyboards are great on this album, especially on the songs I mentioned above. The sleeve has quotes by the band members about each album. Most of the songs are pretty long, but it's okay if you have lots of time to spare. The only bad thing was that the booklet didn't have any photos of the band members."
5,The one star reviewers are k-nuckleheads for disgracing Supertramp,"Supertramp was the late Princess Di's FAVORITE GROUP, not those 80s Backstreet Boy equivalents Duran Duran. Supertramp songs like Bloody Well Right, The Logical Song, Give a Little Bit and It's Raining Again are real classic songs. To see dumbkuffs trash Supertramp is like someone disgracing my friends The Tijuan-an, those Mexican Frogs. This Supertramp is a good starter but go with Retrospectacle or I'll give you a GOTCHA!"
4,Music Like This Gives Me Chills At Times,"While I don't really like most of the songs all that much,(In fact I can't remember their names) the several that I love give me a feeling of euphoria. This hits collection is worth its weight in gold just to have great songs like Take The Long Way Home and Give A Little Bit.(The Logical Song is cool, too) I guess what really turns me on about these kinds of songs is that they get you high. They just seem to have such a positive vibe. Driving home from work is one wild experience when you crank those tunes. I can't can't keep the speedometer under 80mph and I can't keep the volume under 120 decibels.The sound is similar to perhaps a band like YES and if you are interested at all in that kind of 70s rocking sound then this is way more than a worthy purchase."
5,VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,A CLASSIC COMPILATION FROM A GREAT POP ROCK BAND FEATURING GREAT SONGS LIKE THE LOGICAL SONG BREAKFAST IN AMERICA.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
3,Good music with memories attached.,"I enjoyed this CD there are some great songs on it that I knew and wanted to hear again, like ""It's raining again"". However the songs on the album that I hadn't heard before were a little flat and I was disappointed. Perhaps after a few more plays they'll grow on me."
4,sometimes the science and war distracts,"Of course someone with degrees in Chemical Physics is going to focus a good deal on the science in her fiction but sometimes the details can be distracting to those of us who don't have such degrees or a great love of heavy science. But Asaro's societies are still complex and well represented. There are actually three space-age societies: Skolian, Eubian, and Earth Allied. Only two of these, Skolian and Eubian, are dealt with in any great detail and they are almost polar opposites. Almost because both are really oliogarchies. Here the battle is between two races of ""improved"" humans -- one telepathic and one with almost no ability to feel at all. Allied Earth is somewhere in between and in fact, I get the feeling that Earth may be the big problem that hasn't reared its ugly head yet in the series."
5,Great adventure book,"Although Primary Inversion blew me away, this novel far exceeded my expectations. I'm not an avid sci-fi reader, but Soz's character, the adventure and romance makes it an exciting and page-turning novel. I don't like saying too much because giving away too much ruins it for the reader, but if you liked Primary Inversion you'll love this. If you love strong female characters, beautiful romance, adventure, than this book is for you. At some points I get confused with the science stuff, but it's not so overwhelming that a regular person can't follow."
1,What you see is not what you get,"The title is Duets (that means two to me) with Spanish Guitar. I thought that meant two guitars--safe assumption. It turned out to be a guitar and flute. O.k., no problem. What I didn't expect was to have a soprano solo on the CD as well. I am totally displeased that the write-up didn't mention this because I certainly would not have ordered it."
2,"Wait, Warner Brothers WILL restore Popeye in 2007!",Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a July 31 2007 DVD release. Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration. All will be mastered from pristine 35mm nitrate negatives!
5,5 Stars,"A very readable book for young adults about the Spanish Conquest of Peru. Marrin describes in vivid detail the daily life of the Incas before the Spanish arrived. A warlike people, the Incas valued toughness, courage and obedience to authority. They were not strangers to capital punishment or torture. Like the Aztecs, they practiced ritual human sacrifice to appease the many gods they worshipped. Although their society was highly organized and technologically advanced, they were not prepared for warfare on European terms. When Pizarro arrived, he kidnapped their leader and held him for a ransom of silver and gold. Without their leader to give them instructions, the Incas were helpless to launch a rescue mission; they had been trained to obey orders, not to think for themselves. For many years the Incas made attempts to resist Spanish rule, but in the end, Spanish greed, weapons, cruelty and disease overtook them. A sorrowful yet valuable account of the Spanish impact on the New World."
3,"Watch now, next year's too late","My theory is the Mayans just got tired of making calendars and moved on to other things, possibly food-related, but you've got to decide that for yourself, and do it quickly, 'cause time's a-wastin'. This collection of three DVDs begins with 2012 Mayan Prophecy and the Shift of the Ages, which puts a spin on 12/12/12 as a possibly positive event, the beginning of something spectacular, a new age, and not the end of life as we know it. Cool. Less fun and the one I'd go ahead and skip, is 2012: An Awakening, interviews of people studying, teaching and writing in the extra-normal realm, who are quick to rush in with theories and conspiracies wherever science fails to explain. The third DVD is Ancient Code the Movie, which is the science behind what could make a great X-Files type TV series. According to this, we're ticking time-bombs and the code for our ultimate demise is locked into our DNA, or somewhere. Interesting."
4,Mayan Prophecy 101,"When did we begin to worship celebrities? Are those the false gods the Mayans warned of? Three hours of historical background, expert interviews, and film give perspective to the predicted end of the world in 2012. Compelling stuff."
5,Sheer Genius,"If you liked ""Whatever people say I am, thats what I'm not"" you'll like this cd 200% better. At least I do. ""Brianstorm"" is a frenzy of clashing noises that hits all the right notes. but goping past the single, songs like ""Balcava"" and ""Do M a Favour"" really set the mood, I feel, in the cd. You get a sort of sense the whole album is influenced by a burnout life style. in a couple of songs the times the lead singer spits out are so wrong you get a sort of hazy feel. This is definatly gonna be on the bands to watch list for me."
4,Favourite? Yes. Worst? Definately Not.,What a scorching followup album from the lads. There is alot to like on this album.
2,Unsettling,"The vinyl record I ordered was said to be brand new-it did have the seal on it and all, but there were rips on the inside sleeve."
3,"Favourite Worst Nightmare is good, but not throughout","Artic Monkeys have a great sound, however, in my opinion the song ""Florescent Adolescent"" is much, much better than many other songs on the album. If they had more with this type of sound, I would easily recommend it to others. For now, I would just recommend a few of the songs."
2,Very Disappointing...,"Arctic Monkeys' debut album was so intensely good, this album was one of the most anticipated records of the year for me. The anticipation was only amplified upon the hearing of the first new single, Brainstorm, which sounds like it could've been one of the best tracks from Whatever People Think We Are. And that song delivered as the opener, but I kept growing more and more disenchanted over the course of the album. By the last song, I realized, ""I didn't like this album at all!"" The songs are meandering, laborious, and boring, taking all that was good about the Monkeys, all the energy and attitude, and throwing it away for irritatingly listless atmospheric ventures.This is a classic case of Sophomore Slump. Let's hope they come back with a third disc as mindblowing as their first!"
3,Decent Follow-Up,"Not as strong as their first, but easily worth a few spins. This is a young and talented group that should be around for a long time to come."
2,"big deal, simple music for simple minds","so what, they sound a little like the strokes, killers, and the bravery mixed together and I dislike all those bands especially the killers. Oh and you can't forget about the vines. And do all these cookie cutter bands have an ipod commercial?"
5,"f*ckin hell, they did it again","Arctic Monkeys have been my favorite band for a long time. No matter what I hear from them, I automatically fall in love with it. They're sheer genius and so much more. But I have to admit... even I was afraid to hear this album, because it's a bit different. But after having it on repeat for so long, I can't imagine them NOT releasing this brilliant piece of work. They're back and just as amazing as ever. God bless the Arctic Monkeys. sigh.... I LOVE THEM. genius. GENIUS."
5,YES!!! Supremely rocking album!,"These guys just rule. It's a tight, concise album, that thankfully avoids the sophomore slump of trying to make a ""Big Artistic Statement"" (*cough* bloc party *ahem* killers) and instead focuses on rocking hard. There are no wasted notes or time on this album - none! The album is filled with razor sharp hooks and terrific musicianship, particular the spectacular drumming of Matt Helders. The often cryptic, but snidely clever and evocative lyrics and singing of Alex Turner is a real asset as well. Those involved in the recording, mixing, producing etc. deserve kudos as well - the sound just jumps out of the speakers! I love this album! Since I have no life, I listen to a LOT of music and I usually burn through albums quickly, listening once or twice and moving on, but this one I keep coming back to again and again and again.This album is easily the best of '07 so far, BY FAR."
5,NOW I REALLY LIKE THE MONKEYS!,"I always heard about the furor the ARCTIC MONKEYS was creating with their sound...So, i bought FAVOURITE WORST NIGHTMARE...AND NOW I REALLY LIKE THE MONKEYS! These guys create a great punk rock, great songs...I really like all the album! WELL DONE, ARCTIC MONKEYS!!Now i enjoy your songs..."
2,Gimme a Frickin' Break!!,"This garbage was just a prolonged and painful diatribe against the death penalty. Absolutely pathetic, by the numbers, average acting, sad overall movie. Pitt's character was very emotional and powerful. Convincing delivery. But oh my gosh, Juliette Lewis whined and cried so damn much my nerves have permanent damage from all the grating. Her lawyer was just a weak whimp. The characters just said what they were supposed to say, not conveying any conviction or sympathy. I'm glad the jury decided to kill here, so she couldn't whine and moan any more."
1,I agree...A WAISTE OF FINE ACTORS...Horrible film !,"Were do I begin? It was a challenge just to get to the end of this movie. For one there is much too much cursing, but wait...that's not all. The story isn't interesting at all, in fact, it's down right depressing. The acting is B class at best. Which was a huge bummer. I was surprised how bad this movie really was since some of my favorite actors are in it. It seemed like I was watching a really bad after school special...SERIOUSLY! To say it is a bad film is a sad understatement. It is horrible at best and I don't recommend this movie!"
3,"NOT ALWAYS ON THE MONEY, BUT HAS AN EYE OPENING MESSAGE","A TEENAGE GIRL [JULIETTE LEWIS] ALONG WITH HER ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND [BRAD PITT] MURDERS A MAN WHO LEFT HER AND IS SOON CHARGED WITH THE MURDER. THEN, A MAN TRYS TO HELP HER, BEING THAT SHE'S BEING CHARGED AS AN ADULT AND WILL FACE THE DEATH PENALTY. THIS MOVIE HAS AN INTRIGUING STORY AND IT DOES MAKE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW AMERICA'S YOUTH OFTEN GOES IGNORED AND IT ALSO MAKES AN EXAMPLE OF HOW HARSH THE SYSTEM OFTEN TRYS TO BE TOWARD SOME YOUNG OFFENDERS THAT DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE LARGE JAIL SENTENCES. BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR A DECENT DRAMA FILM."
4,Too young to die,"I like this bad boy Brad Pitt,like in Kalifornia. He pairs up with Juliett Lewis so well."
4,Okay,The disc didn't play some of the episodes.i should have sent it back. But for nostalgia it's the show I remember from my childhood. Overall I'm happy.
3,I got this for someone,"Who had never seen the cartoons and wanted to after seeing the live action film. The cartoons have a bit more story depth than that film did, and for their time had really good low budget animation."
3,Speed Racer,"Well, I received the set and my husband loved it until we put the first disc in and it skipped all over the place. The rest of the discs work fine. I ordeered another set and returned the the original and the first disc does the same thing. How disappointing. Can't watch the first disc at all."
4,Classic Speed Racer,"If you don't mind antiquated animation and hilariously awkward sound effects, then you should definitely consider purchasing the complete Speed Racer box set. I was a fan of the show as a kid and my love for it was renewed after watching the recent live action feature film by the creators of the Matrix. The DVD menu is very clean and easy to use and also includes lots of bits of facts and bonus features. It's a great show for kids and adults alike and it all comes in a nice six disc case."
5,Who knew?,"Occupy your toddlers and husbands at the same time. The best part is hearing my 2 1/2 year old try to sing the intro song. It comes out ""Go Racer, Go racer, veture a heaaaad!"" Too funny! I have two boys, three if you count Daddy, but their together time has bought me lots of over due solitude. Daddy is so happy re-living his youth and bonding with his boys, he doesn't even mind changing diapers or cleaning up after their spilled snacks. It's like, a miracle. Someone has replaced my family. Speed Racer is my hero, even if I am getting a little tired of the song."
4,Brought back younger days,I really enjoyed this one. It brought back younger days. I know that now I got to buy the first season DVD. They still are really entertaining to watch. And it still have the old feel of it.
5,"Speed racer, the awesome collection","Having all 52 episodes of my boyhood hero at my fingertips is awesome. Now, I get to share this with my 5 year old grandson, who has been watching the volume 1dvd since he was 2. He's excited about this too. Great times to come. Thank you."
4,Hours of fun.,Mine loves this series. It is funny to watch because it is old and you see old style effects as when the sweat starts running down his face. But fun entertainment for youngsters.
5,A cartoon way ahead of its time.,"Creative writing, incredible characters, top notch animation (for its time), great voice actors, thunderous action sequences, imaginative art and design and amazing atmosphere lead to one thing: a legendary, iconic, revolutionary, pop cultured filled and amazing cartoon that can never be duplicated. I grew up watching ""Speed Racer"", ""Ultraman"", ""Jonny Quest"", ""Land of The Lost"", the ""Banana Splits"" and ""Valley of The Dinosaurs"". ""Speed Racer"" is a multi-generational, multi-cultural event in the world of television and cartoons and it is second to none. Rather it be the haunting ""GRX"" episode, the stunt-filled episodes with the ""Car Acrobatic Team"", the haunting ""X-3"", the brutality of the car wrestling match, the mayhem of the ""Mammoth Car"" or the destruction of the ""Monster Car"". This cartoon blows away almost anything out in the last 30 years. My children love this cartoon too. 10/10."
5,The LADY works her butt off!!! Great Show!,"I've seen the Monster Ball tour twice in Houston, I can say that the live is much better than the dvd version. One of the things I didn't like from the editing is that they did not include the interludes. Those were essential to the show and it should have been included. One thing that I can agree on she does talk alot and reminds me of a church. But I like it. If you haven't seen her life then this DVD can work for you."
3,Stop Yelling At Me Please,"I have been a fan of Lady Gaga since the beginning so I specifically sought out this blu ray release. However I have to admit that this was a bit of a disappointment especially considering some of the other blu ray releases by female artists in 2011. Three things about this that were disappointing to me were: The production value was missing something--I really expected the scale to be larger and the design and costumes to just overall be more beautiful. The music seemed to be more centered around two dueling 80s guitars rather than driving dance beats, and above all I grew tired of Gaga screaming not only at the audience but me at home. So overall a bit of a let down. I did enjoy Adele, Britney and Taylor Swifts blu ray releases in 2011 more by comparison."
5,excellent concert,"lady gaga did an excellent she sing live, her performance was incredible. she is the best artist ever. she is better than britney spears"
5,Great!,"Exactly what I wanted. It's Lady Gaga's concert. Close to as being there as possible. There are no breaks. The only thing I wish is there to be more backstage/after/before the concert clips. Still, Love GAGA!"
2,Talk tooooo much !!!,I like her performances but...why she talk too much in the concert?? It really make the show sooo boring. Honestly her performances were great except the talking part.
1,Xerox,another CHEAP knock off from lady xerox. BOO!GET SOME ORIGNALITYif you missed it on HBO you certainly aren't missing anything buying it. save your $$this is really realy cheesy.she has no talent AT ALL.
2,Fake,"This performer is very talented and puts on a good show, but I am of the belief that it is realy a man posing as a woman. Perhaps Lady GaGa is a transvestite and we are all being deceived. I have seen pictures on the internet of what looked like male parts. I'm positive if the pictures are on the internet they must be true, :-) . An operation would account for the missing parts of recent pictures, but when I look at the face I can't help to think it's really a man, i.e. ""Dude GaGa"", LOL."
3,Great Concert...,"So I've been to plenty of Gaga shows since The Fame era, before she actually became huge.This was an extremely entertaining show and shows Gaga can command a stage for sure.The setlist was great, no complaints there.My biggest problem with this show is all the yelling. There is so much yelling from her part I felt like I was in church being preached to!Overall loved the show and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of pop music."
5,#1 Fan,"I was so excited to see this on DVD. I don't have HBO so I was watching the bootleg version on you tube. I attended her concert in my hometown but I was on the floor, right by the railing - which is amazing. Sadly, there was also a lot I missed not having the advantage of seeing the whole stage. Now, I get to watch it at home and relive the memories of being at The Monster Ball myself."
2,"Boring, looks like a cheap copy of Madonna","the cd version is much more interesting, creative, innovative. As for her presence on stage, looks like an old movie, not entertaining at all. She tries to convince, but just can't. Only recommended to those really big fans, concert goers, etc."
3,I felt a little uncomfortable watching this,"I like some of Lady Gaga's songs like Bad Romance, Judas, Born This Way and Paparazzi so I bought this thinking I was going to get a concert along the lines of Gwen Stefani or someone but this had a lot of gay stuff that made me uncomforable. She was doing a song called Boys Boys Boys ( I think) and there was a bunch of gay dances that made me uncomfortable to watch. Also, Lady Gaga went off on rants about gay people and a gay unicorn and I had to turn down the volunme for fear my neighbors might hear the gay rants and get the wrong idea about me. I know there's an explicit and edited version. Does the edited version have all the gay stuff removed. If So I think that's the one I should have bought."
1,Boring...,"The whole concert lacks of charm !, The coreographies are so stupid !,, it is like those modern dance , that rich people pretend to understand !, hopefully she will gone with the time....."
1,"Lady Gaga Looks Great ,Very Entertaining","The only thing I didnt like was,the constant( Swearing GODS name in vane)I dont understand what advantage she thinks this brings..? Other than that this is a Great show ."
2,Show was Boring. Some performances are entertaining.,"Let me just tell you what it was that I did not like about this concert, she talked too much. It seemed that she had a long story almost after every song she performed. The costumes were ridiculous, what else can we expect from her. But some of the performances I must admit were fun to watch. I would have enjoyed this DVD if it wasn't for those long speeches she gave, some that had no relevance to the show. I get that fans that look up to her might enjoy hearing that stuff, but I just have to say that not everyone is interested in hearing a whole book on her adventures in Madison Square Garden. The only speech I remember, and did not mind was her sharing how she used to visit the arena and now is performing in it. The rest of it, I completely forgot and should have probably just fast forwarded through it."
1,Defected product,I have to return this item. First it did not fit my 5300 Winix model and then the carbon filter is leaking all over the frame and the package plastic bag. Good thing is Amazon's return process made it easy for returning defected product.
3,"Overall a good book, but too heavy on the quantum physics","I have been trying to use this text for an undergraduate course in solid-state devices at the University of Texas at Tyler and have found that the material is far too advanced for juniors in electrical engineering. Singh goes into too much detail in quantum physics for the needs or interests of the typical junior electrical engineer. It would be best kept for selective use in senior-level and graduate courses in solid-state physics where it would likely be an excellent text. If you are looking for a more-introductory treatment, I would highly recommend Ben Streetman's time-honored and tested text (which I will use the next time I have to teach this course)."
2,"3 stars for graduates, 2 star for undergraduate.","This book is too advanced for an introductory of semiconductor. The language is ok. The author seems to explains everything with minimum sentences. Sometimes, I read those signs and I don't have any idea about it. Author did not explain it. I think author should expain every sign in an equation to make sure students can understand that equation. Another problem is the mathematics in this book. Many book would give references in the end. But this book expects u know everything( mathematics and some field and waves, without giving any references. The worst part is example. Author did not explain examples completely. It is jump from one equation to another. You need a high intelligence to learn from this book. the barrier to too high for an junior student."
2,Too much info about Rock's Movie Plots,"I was hoping for a comprehensive biography of Rock Hudson. While it is an acceptable depiction of the actor's life, I was disappointed to see how the author padded with book with detailed information about the plots in Rock's movies. I don't need a rehash of movie plots; I wanted information on Rock himself, or if discussing his films, the backstory behind them. Anybody who is a fan of Rock already knows the story lines to his movies.The author does provide an interesting argument about how Rock contracted AIDS, believing it to be from blood transfusions when he had his open heart surgery, rather than from unprotected sex.If you want an overall general biography of Rock Hudson, this is a good choice, but not the ultimate Rock Hudson biography."
2,Major Dissapointment,"While not being an obsessive fan of the Cabela Series, I have been a fan nonetheless. Most recently I enjoyed Dangerous Hunts for the PSP, and though rather short and limited in scope, it was a fun game to play. I expected a great deal more with this game, but instead felt like it was a big step backwards. This time you are able to navigate via vehicles throughtout different regions in Alaska (trucks, snowmobiles etc), but the control is quite frustrating. The animals/game are less than engaging and the game itself it outright boring. One fun feature is the shot cam where you follow your fired round from barrel to destination in slow-motion. Otherwise this is a game that I find to boring to finish, and feel as though you may just want to hold out until the next Cabela release which I am sure will be better....I do not think it could be worse."
3,disappointing game,This game has an energy bar are you kidding me. Imagine you in Alaska with an energy bar. (Person in game.) I'm walking in Alaska oh I'm so tired because I'm walking. key word walking. (me) there are too many invisible walls (guy in game) Kerpow what the hell is this in the forest you've gotta be kidding me what the this is crazy. (me)Hopefully this is helpful to you.
2,What Am I Shooting At?,"I picked this game up in the $10 bin at a local store. I have since sold it on Ebay. Having said that, it is worth that price and nothing more. I enjoyed the hunts and strategy of the game. The graphics, however, were horrible, and it is almost impossible to tell what you are shooting at. Tracking is just about useless, and you are penalized if you shoot a species or gender that you do not have tags for. Overall this game could have been so much better. I expect more out of future Cabela installments."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK,"I read through the 500 formulas and thought the 556 formulas would be a better book, very disappointed on the content of the book."
4,Rock Solid faith,"A great little, easy-to-read book that applies basic gardening techniques to one's spiritual well-being. Whether you are an avid gardener or a beginner, a spiritual person or just trying to improve, this little gem can give you the push in the right direction. Having just finished building a rock garden (using almost 24 tons of rocks!) I was given this book as a gift and truly enjoyed its common sense insights, its brief history of rock-gardeing in the United states, and its practical gardening tips."
3,Non-Christian orientation distracting,"I have read a very large number of books about the Camino de Santiago-- the pilgram road to St. James at Santiago de Campostela, Galicia, Spain.This one is particularly distracting because the writer has an overlay of non-Christian magical beliefs not to my taste."
1,A Neo-Pagan Book,"A Neo-Pagan BookThis is a neo-pagan book. Most of the chapters begin with a pagan initiation, whose spirituality consists of an ego trip of feelings.The book contains some elements of distorted Christianity tossed in to confuse the reader, who expects to follow in the footsteps of the classical pilgrims, on their journey to Santiago de Compostella.Nausicaa"
5,An alchemical journey!,"The setting is the famous ''Camino de Santiago'' across Northern Spain -- a journey which has inspired legions of pilgrims over a period of many centuries. The fantastic setting is only the beginning, however, as many a life-changing event have happened to those brave enough to make this lengthy pilgrimage and complete it. Paulo Coelho leaves the reader almost breathless at times with details of his own experiences along this historic path, from tentative beginning through to the surprising finish. Even for those hailing from other spiritual paths (i.e. non judeo-christian) this book will provide a thrill as the message of ''Fighting the Good Fight'' in search of what's important in life is one that speaks to all of us. Magnificently written!"
5,Just fantastic...,"Dear friends readers who just bought or want to buy this book, I think it is worth to read it even twice and have it in your home library. It can really change your view to life, peace, love, passion, belief...Enjoy."
3,No magical revelations,"I'm not sure what I expected this book to be, but I was hoping to find some inspiration that would make me want to take my own pilgrimage. I didnt find any mystical answers or a sudden inspiration to follow in the footsteps of the author. However, to be fair, I did find some thought provoking gems buried within its pages."
4,Finally Got Into It,"Took me a while as he developed his theme. Had read 'The Best Way--El Camino de Santiago',by Bill Walker, which was very entertaining. This is a very different book--much deeper, but worthwhile in the end. Now I'm ready for this August!"
4,THE BOOK OF THE LIFE,"First I want to say that it was great to read this book because I learned something new and its very important for me. This book is too diferent and the others books that I read because all the time gave advices but this book it was different because when I was reading and I finished each chapter I analyzed everything and the same time I remembered something important in my life. The best thing that I learned in this book is that we still our goals, we need to make effort, to have time and the principal faith in God and we are going to do it. Also, it was great to gave a opinion in different ways like love, death, enthusiasm, marriage, etc. I guess that we always need to express what we feel in everything I mean, we need to say everything that we think,want,etc."
2,A spiritual story which left me thoroughly confused.,I did not particularly care for the overly dramatic and spiritual presentation of the subject. I was looking for a more practical report on El Camino which would give me mileage between refuges and information about the towns and villages along the way.
3,Swords and Santiago.,"Another of those ""path to enlightenment"" accounts (ala Shirley MacLaine, Lynn Andrews, Carlos Castenada) in which the candidate is put through a harrowing and confusing series of trials by his enigmatic spiritual guide. The recognition of life's great truths, which the pilgrim has actually known all along but refused to acknowledge, is the ultimate goal and the way to know oneself and the purpose of one's life. That's what this book is about, with little information about what it is like to walk this famous route or arrive at the cathedral destination.Described as dazzling and poetic, I wonder if something was lost in translation, as this reads in a somewhat sophomoric and clunky fashion. Books of this sort have their place, and for those who have not encountered any of them before, The Pilgrimage can open the mind."
4,Silvia Guzman: Montebello Adult School,"Dear Readers, I read the book,""The Pilgrimage,"" the book was great and very interesting. I imagine how Paulo felt when he traveled the road to Santiago de Compostela, many good and bad things happened to him. I think he was lucky to find a good guide such as Petrus. He could learn many things from Petrus. To me the most interesthing parts were the RAM exercises, I'm practicing these exercises and they're helping me to have control with myself. I give my congratilations to Paulo for his grand courage."
1,Oh dear,"Silly, very silly. The Pilgrimage is a ridiculous confection of half thought out semi spiritual nonsense. Paulo Coelho claims to have walked part of the route, catching a bus through the mountains of Galicia, in search of his 'sword' in the company of a male spiritual guide. He enjoyed plenty of out of body experiences and wrestled with a dog, which was of course the devil himself, not one of the thousands of wild dogs in Spain.This book will and does appeal to a large section of society, and if your bookshelves are groaning under the weight of dream interpretaion and past life exploration books, then take a look at your Feng Shui advice guide and throw them all out and replace them with a slim volume of the Pilgrimage, it has it all - even tranced out dancing in a castle. I wonder if Paulo paid the 4Euro entrance fee to join his fellow Knights Templar for that?"
1,Occult,"I think I read somewhere the author is Catholic. Can't be a very good one or know much about his faith. I got this book on kindle for my husband after we both watched The Way, hoping it would add to our knowledge and desire to make the pilgrimage. He didn't even finish reading it. It has numerous strange brain exercises the reader is asked to try (and even physical positions, like curling into a near fetal position, face down, arms extended by sides). The last straw was the request to imagine Satan, the devil, in your head...that was the last straw. Catholics do NOT invite Satan into their heads; it is nothing less than dabbling in the occult which is always detrimental to one's soul, and a good source for nightmares. It has nothing to do with prayer or meditation on higher things. Very sorry we spent the money on this book; I would not even give it away. Into the recycle bin it goes."
2,DISAPPOINTING BUT INTERESTING,"I read The Alchemist by the same author, which, i liked very much and so i was very excited to read more of his books. I read the Pilgrimage next and found it disappointing and lacking the surrealism and mysticism that made me crave for more. The story is interesting in that it's about the author's pilgrimage. I found it long and almost tedious to read through his journey, feelings, and thoughts. I was relieved to have finished it. The good thing about having read this book is it made me want to take the pilgrimage as well - not for any soul seraching purpose but for travel and adventure. I think it would an interesting guide - comparing sites, thoughts and feelings."
3,The Alchemist,"The book, of course, is brilliant, how it arrived to me; the book was damaged but still 'good', as was advertised."
1,Awful awful awful. Just plain awful!!!!,"This book was just painful to finish. Pointless new age pseudo religious drivel. Coelho goes on a Catholic pilgrimage, wrestles with possessed dogs, hangs out with magicians and then dances around in castles pretending to be a knight Templar with his equally loony mates.This is supermarket spirituality at its very worst. A pointless book unless you are one of those ""All organised religion is bad so lets just make it up as you go along"""
3,A Private Journey to Explore Self,"Although ""The Pilgrimage"" is not Paulo Coelho's most exalted work, it is still a wonderful plunge into the mystical journey. In this book, he chronicles his own experiences on the road to Santiago de Compostela in the region of Galicia known as Celtic Spain. The journey is rich with allegory reflecting how we must face our own fears in order to engage in what he calls ""the good fight"". The Pilgrimage is reminiscent of Carlos Castañeda's apprenticeship with his mentor Don Juan. Paulo's guide is the enigmatic Petrus, who teaches him to face his own limitations and to break him from the ""modernist"" notion that our busy work is more important than exploring our inner world. There is a sweet discovery about the book that brings presence to a wisdom that includes mystical exercises worthy of our attention."
3,"Strange, interesting book","Once I started reading this book I couldn't stop. However, at the same time I thought it to be a strange tale, certainly not something I would expect from someone who would want to walk El Camino for religious purposes. Maybe I'm a sceptic, but the excercises struck me as too good to be true - I wonder if they would really work on someone who's trying to find some kind of inner peace. Anyways, I would recommend anyone to read it and maybe exchange ideas on it."
4,"Good travel book, interesting personal perspective","This was Coelho's first popular book, and as such denotes his evolving magical style. It is about his trip in the Santiago de COmpostela trek that goes from east to west across Spain. I found the travel perspective of the book to be fascinating, and since I read it I have thought many times about doing the trek myself.As for the personal revelation the author encounters in the trek, I foudn them interesting, not overwhelming. The lessons learned are presented in many different books aside form this one; what makes this book a little special, I believe, is that the story involves the reader in such a way that the lessons are driven effortlessly."
3,Coelho's First,"""The Pilgrimage"" is the third book I have read by Paulo Coelho, although it was his first. It was first published as ""O Diário de um Mago"" in 1987, and the first English translation was titled: ""The Diary of a Magus"" and was published in 1992. This is the tale of Paulo's own personal pilgrimage along the road to Santiago. After failing to earn his sword in his ordination as a Master of the Order of RAM, he is directed to take a pilgrimage to seek his sword there, as well as the wisdom he would need to use it.Despite being a more personal story, I didn't find it to be nearly as engaging of a narrative as ""The Alchemist"". Since I read the translations by Alan R. Clarke of both books, I tend to think that perhaps this is due to Coelho's improvement as a writer. That is not to say that this is not an interesting book. ""The Pilgrimage"" is still a good story, and for those who like Paulo Coelho, it is certainly worth reading."
2,a new age version of the legendary journey to Compostela,"I discovered this book during my first journey on the road to Compostela in 1991. All the young Spaniards had a copy in their back pack. The author created a New Age delirium giving the path to Compostela an image of witchcraft and the occult. During my three journeys on the road to Compostela ( 91 95 96) I happened to have met some of the key characters the author mentions in this book, and they were very unhappy with the author's version of the Compostela experience as well as with the use of their life. I disliked how the pilgrim gives up the road for a bus ride at the end of the book, which is a ""sacrilage"" once you enter such an experience."
5,The Pilgrimage,"To whoever likes to read: I read ""The Pilgrimage"" Paulo Coelho's highly book. I recomended this book because through this book I learned the inmense love that God has given to us. It's important to understand who we are, and what is our job in this world. This book shows us the good and bad things that everyone has in our interior. Also,I realized all the love that I have for my family."
3,The Pyranees,Interesting story. There is certainly a lot of history in that area. I just finished reading a good new book:The Sacred Spring of the Blood Royal: The Secret Order of the GrailIt reminds me of Coehlo's work but less self involved and better written.
5,Dewalt Saw Blade,Dewalt always provides quality products. This saw blade works very well in my circular saw and I will order again in the future. Blade was exactly as described and shipped very quickly.
5,Scary fun!,"While Rebeccasreads screamingly recommends HALLOWEEN NIGHT ON SHIVERMORE STREET for children ages 4 to 8, it can easily enchant any reader with a love for creatively creepy fun. This is one party kids & adults will want to read about over & over again, especially on those moonlit nights leading up to Halloween itself. Do try the whipped-cream-covered ants -- they were simply TO DIE FOR!A fun, bouncy, hair-raising, rhyming tale, illuminated by Randy DuBurke's wild illustrations of all the usual suspects you'd ever hope to encounter at this time of year!"
4,Sexist and missing some major gems from this genre but decent enough,As a female I found it a bit saddening that the collector for this absent mindedly just ommited many key female players and I was also sad that they did not include any Dock Boggs. I was dissapointed that they left Ola Belle Reed out of this. There is nothing more haunting or beautifully depressing than some of her tunes...but that is history for you. Women sometimes seem to be forgotten until years later. However there are some good tunes on here so it is worth the buy. Grandpa Jones is worth it enough but some other stuff I just wasn't feeling...
4,Works Nice,"These wall braces do exactly what they are supposed to do. Makes it a lot easier to line a wall with only one person. They are expensive in my opinion for what they do though. A product called a form leveler for concrete work does the same thing with a adjustable brace and a 2x4. The length of these make them best suited for 8 or 9 foot walls, where the form leveler is infinite with the length of the 2x4 and much less expensive."
3,Its alright,It covers the area described and fits as designed but the edges tend to curl up for some reason. Its ok though
4,A wonderfully creative book!,"This book was awesome and the only reason why I didn't give it full marks was because the titles of the characters did get a little confusing and at times i found getting them all straight was very confusing. I noticed that once i got into the book it got easier to understand,but i think that i missed part of the magic of the book at first. Young Lyewen was an awesome character he kept his wits about him and his story was a really fascinating one to follow. Overall this book was great and i would recomend it to anyone who loves stories from medivial times!"
1,Not sure where the positives are coning from ?????,As I stated I am unsure where the positives are as I just purchased this and ran in my 30 degree garage for over half an hour with no change in temp. I can heat the same space with a blow dryer faster than this thing!
4,"nice, but limited heating","I've had this heater for about a month so far (November), this unit has worked well and is quiet, but the heating capacity is limited. Granted, I have this in an underheated sunroom, and it will take the worst edge off the cold, but it won't bring the room up to temperature. What it will do is give nice radiant heat to anyone sitting moderately close to the front of it -- we have two chairs in the sunroom as well as a hot tub, and we put the heater right in front across from the two chairs.This is an effective supplemental heater only for a well insulated room and/or a warmer climate than the northeast US!"
1,Can't believe I bought it again,"I got one of these several years back. Worked fine at first, then seemed to lose all ""oomph"". Took forever to heat up and worked unpredictably. Periodically the overheat button would turn on for no apparent reason. I thought I might have a defective unit, and the design was so pretty that I bought another. Same problems! Didn't last more than two months. Don't waste your money. I can't believe these are still in production. Aren't there any quality control regulations out there?"
1,Not the best heater on the market,"I bougt this because it was quiet and had digital controls, I put this in my bedroom and have to have it set at 59 because it heats to 72 on the low setting. So I returned that one and got another one, but that one did the same thing. unless you get this as a supplemet heat for a large area, I would not buy it."
4,A Great Option - Thank you!,I wanted to voice my opinion after reading the lengthy slam of the Soleus heater. As far as product it has worked wonderfully for us and just in time to give our gas furnace a break (from draining our wallet). We have heat where and when we need it and are very happy with our Micathermic heater I purchased thru amazon.
2,tripled my electric bill,"I hate this heater. It heats really well, but costs a fortune to use. There is no way to set the heaters temp. It seemed to have a mind of its own. I live in a small 1073 sq ft home. My first month, December, my electric bill was $378. So I kept it on 1000 watts instead of 1500. The next month using 1000 watts my bill was $278. I have GAS HEAT!!!!! It's too late to send it back and I am bummed. I have bought several space heaters in my day but never have I had such a high bill. The highest electric bill I've ever have was $170 and that was a summer with over 100 degree weather for weeks. I think they weren't made the same. Some people said it didn't heat, but my did. It just cost a fortune."
1,Unhappy with heater I purchased,"I purchased 3 of these heaters, one for each bedroom. I was very unhappy with them and returned all for a refund. There were two problems. First, very little heating capacity. The $20 space heaters from Wal-Mart I bought produced much more heat. Secondly, I had purchased these heaters because of the wall-mount feature. I thought that would be cool to have them out of the way. The problem was that the back got extremely hot (couldn't even touch surface without discomfort). I called the company and they said that it was safe, not a fire hazard. However, upon calling two people (one handyman, one person in heating department at Lowe's), they did say it was a fire hazard, that the drywall and wood couldn't get that hot behind it. I was extremely uncomfortable mounting it to the wall because I was afraid I would burn the house down! It just did not appear to be as safe as the company was saying it was. So I returned all three and got a refund on all of them.Sallie"
2,Negative review,"Soleus Air HGW-308 Micathermic Flat Panel Heater]The reason we purchased 3 of these heaters was because the one we purchassed in Pa at Sam,s outlet store and are using is the greatest heater we purchased,it work,s and heats any cold spot in the room and I would rate it above 5 star,s. But the 3 we purchased that had the same model number did not come with front controls on it and the people using them said they only worked for a minute or two then shut off.It seems the control on the side of the panel that supposingly has a thermostat does not and this makes this heater useless. The one we purchased at sam,s club has a remote control and buttons on the front panel that control the temp and this kind works perfect,just stay away from the soleus heater with the side knob control."
1,It's a joke,"Set at the highest temperature, this thing couldn't heat a small bathroom. Waste of money. My cats and dog love to find a warm spot in the house. They can find the smallest ray of sunshine on the floor. They think this heater is just another piece of furniture. I was tricked by the high-tech sounding ""Micathermic Heater"". What a JOKE!!!"
1,"POOR QUALITY, FIRST TIME TRIPPERS ONLY","Very poor quality film, considering the amount of visitors to the Natinal parks every year, surely they could afford an new film (IMAX), the picture is very blocky and the coverage of each park is very limited, if youve never visited the parks contained on this 80min DVD before its worth a look, otherwise buy a nice book."
4,Excellent photography and information,"I felt the information provided for this video was misleading. We expected to get two tapes of video, instead we got one tape and a commercial. The one tape of video is excellent, and one we will watch again and again."
1,worse quote book ever,"only payed .01 plus tax so sent to Good Will. I love qoutes and have several books of them at home, but was so dissappointed in this one. They were short,stupid and of no wisdom. (maybe a couple) Wouldn't recommend this one to anyone. On the other hand I got it fast but not in the condition promised. I bought it used but, looking like new? No."
2,famous word review,"Some of the sayings are ok, but I was hoping for more thoughts with ""meat"" to them."
3,"Loved the movie since I was a kid, The quality of the VHS is bad!!!","Ok so after ordering a dvd of the same movie and only to receive it and be of bad quality, I went on to read reviews and found that some said that this original vhs tape was uncut and good quality so I proceeded to purchase it. Well, one thing was true, it is uncut and features the nunchuku scene among other scenes as well but I have to say that the video quality is terrible. My buddy at Motophoto did his best at transferring the vhs to dvd using a high tech vhs player and other filters to bring out the best quality and still couldn't save it. In other words, this version is still of equal bad quality as those bootlegs that are being sold out there. Hope the true master tapes will be released by the parent company some day, then we can get a good copy of this classic."
2,Good theme but more buzzwords and bull than practical advice,"I was disappointed by this book. While its central thesis (that MIS should include human and political considerations, not just technical ones) is valid and needs championing, I found the text repetitive, lacking in clear advice, and full of buzzwords used to restate the obvious. Mr. Davenport is clearly an expert on how to run MIS at large companies. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to glean applicable lessons from his book"
5,Brilliant!,"This 11th entry in the Outlanders saga ranks up there as one of the best so far. It was great to go back to the Anthill again, it's even more eerie the second time around. This episode contains some great character interaction along with fascinating insight into Lakesh and his past as well as some intense action sequences. The downsides such as the abrupt ending and some pretty blatant typos early on failed to diminish my enjoyment of this book one iota. Highly Recommended!"
2,Meh...,"This mix is not really that great. The aroma is very strong vanilla, but not a pleasant vanilla. It smells like a cheap vanilla candle. The flavor is very artificial, which surprised me when I reviewed the ingredients. I can't say that I hate it...but I really don't like it. I can't return it and I have no idea what to do with the other 5 unopened cans."
5,My personal favorite,"Enchanted Chai has become a personal favorite for me. I'm not a coffee fan, and hot chocolate is just too sweet. It's wonderful to have found a warm drink for those cold mornings. This powdered form is the perfect middle ground between hot tea and hot cocoa. It's worth the try. I'm hooked."
4,"A good history of the ""vermin of the skies.""","Although it's a little dry in places and could use some more illustrations and a few more photographs, the book does a decent job of introducing the reader to the history of asteroids, their discoverers, the implications for mass extinctions on earth, and the efforts being taken today to detect them and deflect them before they have a chance to make a bad impression."
5,Greatest,"Some time ago I was looking for this album. I had asked for a local store, but without results, now I have, and I have almost completed my collection"
3,a very capable but somewhat formulaic detective story,"'Nightwork' is yet another Brandstetter mystery by Joseph Hansen. Our favorite insurance investigator, Dave Brandstetter, this time chases down some nasty people involved with illegally hauling dangerous cargo in big rigs in response to the death of one of the truckers. Of course along the way we run into murder, a couple of bizarre characters, and a plot that never quite engaged this reader. The prose is fine but the characterizations have grown too soft as the Brandstetter series progressed. I also find the relationship between the lead character and his gay lover to be too cute, a little to much of forced side show. This sort of books pales compared to anything by the likes of Dennis Lehane or even Harlan Coben.Bottom line: a very forgettable book. Not recommended."
5,Beautiful songs by a great singer,"Today is Eydie Gorme's 80th birthday...Happy Birthday Eydie! If you can find a copy of this CD somewhere at a reasonable price, get it! Hard to believe this album was recorded over 50 years ago. Her version of Why Try to Change Me Now alone makes it worth is getting the CD. Great singing and beautiful orchestrations by Don Costa."
3,Order Carefully,"Since I am a fan of Dervla Kirwan, I tried for a year to get this DVD; however, when it arrived, I found that it was in German without even sub-titles in English. Oddly enough, it is possible to follow the story line, and Dervla's performance is delightful.Please use caution in placing an order for this DVD; make sure your DVD player will play Region 2 DVD's and that it comes in the language preferred."
1,Cheap and breaks!,"This is a great concept, but it doens't work. I used mine three times then it broke. The first three stitch ""staples"" tore the paper and looked awful. Even if it still worked I wouldn't ever use it because the nasty looking hole it left in the paper looked so bad."
4,Brilliant Caprice Basque,"Itzhak Perlman, a widley renowned virtuoso, does not always impress me. However, this recording certainly did. Although he tends to sometimes crash his bow down, there is a brilliance and a delicacy to his playing. The last movement of Carmen is clear and the intonation is good. The tempo of the third movement is too fast for my taste. The other work that I really loved was Caprice Basque. He has a certain disregard for the score (dynamic wise,) but the performance is wonderful. Sarasate was known for his intonation in the high registers, and Perlman's is great also. The part of this CD that meant the most to me, though, is that you can hear the passion with which he plays. It's difficult, even for the most musical of performers, to bring that through on a recording, but Perlman manages it - really well."
1,Trash,"I placed these into the AQ and in two weeks they were broken, due granted I do have two Oscars but still a product could be better than this."
5,Better then expected!,"This c.d. envelopes complexity and simplicity in a romantic and gentle harmony that reflects from the singer and the instruments into the listeners mind. Lyrically creative and musically in depth builds every word and breakdown perfectly. The highlihts on the c.d. are ""Better Run"" ""Meet You at the Mouth"" and ""Still Believe in You"". But the whole album carrys on gracefully and completes itself generously."
5,Great CD!,Just wonderful pure rock with haunting melodies that have the ability to put a smile on your face after even the roughest day. It's excellent and I think Army of Me has now carved out their own unique style. Why this album isn't all over the radio proves (yet again) how corrupt the mainstream music industry is. Do yourself a favor and buy this instant classic.
3,IT WORKS,"Not sure I would recommend this to others. It works, but is not meant to be used out of doors and it isn't really big enough to do much indoors. I do like the ""non chewable"" cord feature however."
5,Old cat loves her petmate heating pad.,"My old cat LOVES her petmate heating pad (10x20) the only time she leaves it is to eat or use the litter box. I like the heavy duty ""bite proof"" cord."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. I already had the bed it fit in, so I just needed the heater. My weenie dog is elderly and it really helps him through the winter. He loves it!"
3,Beware,Great item for heating a crate but beware my little 7 pound dog has chewed threw the cord were the pad and cord meet and has also chewed the corners of the pad which can become a fire hazard.
5,Cat loves it!!!,"Hey, our cat is living large. Bought this for installation under a small cat bed, which is located on a bench in our garage. Even thought the garage stays above freezing, this little heater turned his bed into a cozy warm retreat. Cat loves it and is always curled up and comfortable. Well made, no obvious issues with hurting or electrocuting the cat... of course, ours' does not chew on the cord.... which is designed and extremely well insulated. Great product, consumes very little energy, highly recommended.... just match the size of your pet with the available heater sizes."
3,Works good - needs on-off switch.,"The product does make our small dog happy to sleep in her bed. But it stays on 24/7 due to no switch (plug is behind dresser). We will put it on a timer eventually, Needs to have the switch.."
5,Pet Heating Pad,I purchased two of these to keep my four pups warm during the winter. They love them and we are all happy with their trouble-free operation.
1,My order,NOT happy at all with this order. First they got it wrong. Now its taking FOREVER to recieve the new ones to replace it. I need it for my puppies and I don't have it. This order I wish I just shopped local.
4,Buddy Warmer,My dog's new best friend! He used to sleep in a tiny little tight ball at night and now spralls out on his bed in comfort. My husband likes to turn the heat down at night and sleep under the covers but my dog doesn't stay under a blanket. I bought this bed warmer and put it in the plush bed I already had for my dog and he is very happy at night! You do have to remember to unplug it in the morning so it won't run all day. The one I had from last year finally died from being left on all the time day and night. If you unplug it during the day it seems to have a long life time and makes my dog very comfortable.
2,Photo Mis-leading,"The photo shows a circuit breaker type electrical plug, which was my deciding factor when I choose this heater. BUT the photo is incorrect; just a standard plug on this heater."
1,Good idea - poor execution,This product stopped functioning after about 6 months of usage despite all instructions having been followed to the letter. I resent paying good money for an unreliable product... explore alternatives before opting for this brand!
4,"Not thrilling, but solid -- 3.6 stars","With its terrific evocation of a small Southern town where everybody knows everything about everybody else, North has created a setting that is almost like one of the characters. Jenifer and Eric are solid leads. Their romance is not super hot, but it feels realistic (much more so than many romances). Jenifer is undestandably hesitant to embark upon an affair, and her journey into love is beautifully rendered. There's also a lovely thread about Eric finally coming to feel like he fits in.The mystery is woven seamlessly into the romance, and there are plenty of little details that add to the book's charm and realism. A warm, highly enjoyable read."
2,Corel DRAW 9 Graphic Suite Manual de Uso con CD-ROM:,Corel DRAW 9 Graphic Suite Manual de Uso con CD-ROM:
1,This is a piece of junk!,"I ordered this based on the rave reviews. I am very sorry that I did, because it looks like is should cost $5 at the most. I returned it, but only received half my money back! Don't be taken in by these reviews--this is a piece of junk!"
4,AGREE W/ WHAT A MISTAKE,"Goodness those were good times. What a mistake omitting ""Killing Time In The Crystal City"". My girlfriend and I bonded over ""Watch The North Wind Rise"" (from Hoppkorv) and wish only that they had played it that magical evening(s)."
3,What a mistake,"The album is good as I remember it but they left of the best acoustic song on the album (Killing Time in the Crystal City).This was a seven minute acoustic guitar workout. It was on the original vinyl album,but I guess time did not allow for it on a single disc .If you purchase the {Japanese remaster} of this album it comes with a Double disc with all the songs plus 5 extra songs from the concert, now thats worth it . Stay away from this incomplete album."
5,Finally,"Finally a complete version of Double Dose on CD! Great performance, great sound, so-so packaging, but this is a great Hot Tuna concert, which begs the question: Since this is now on 2 CDs, why not use the extra space on the 2nd CD to present material that couldn't fit on the original 2-disc album? Instead, we get 2 songs and then interviews on the disc, interviews that can only be interesting for the first listen, and after it's hit eject after the songs. Oh, what could have been!"
4,Verdi the patriot,"Giovanna d'Arco is an average opera compared with the rest of Verdi's works. I'm glad someone recorded it as it is rarely performed. Caballe is excellent in the title role. I think recording is the best because, as others have already noted, the sound quality is horrible in the Tebaldi versions. It's interesting to see how Verdi's music was developing at this time. The opera was a success, due largely to its themes and the Italian people's nationalistic feelings towards the Austrian presence within their own country. Verdi had used his music to inspire this movement and inspire Italian unity, which would come but not for many years later. Is it just me or does ""Ai Lari!...Alla Patria!"" sound vaguely similar to the main motif of the Dies Irae of his famous Requiem many years later? Perhaps he was drawing some inspiration for his later works from these early works."
3,If you like your Verdi to Rock,"This set has always been harshly criticized for Levine's conducting. It is said he drives too hard, etc. I think that complaint is somewhat unfair considering that this is about the only version of the opera around, and the negative attitude has not succeeded in the creation of a new version. So let's not worry about what people say for now, and talk about what you have to look forward to...Lots of rockin' tunes with quick tempos. But this is early Verdi, so it's important to move. Domingo sings a high C# in his first number, and Milnes (not unusually), sings an A natural in a duet with Caballe. So that should give you a good idea of what this set is about. Put simply, it rocks. It doesn't have the depth of a good recording of Bocanegra or Otello or Falstaff, but it will have to suffice for now."
1,recording quality,"This product does not perform as it should. Some tracks repeat as if there are scratches on the CD, and some do not have music on them (or so it seems). This is the worst product of this kind that I've hever bought. I will keep away from EMI recordings. They are crap!!!!! Can I get my money back?"
3,Good Grip (Good Gripe),"I have a number of Oxo Good Grip spulas. I like their sturdiness, balance, and feel in my hand. However, they all have the same weakness: too thick a blade to really get under foods such as cookies. They will definitely not scratch your cookware. But be careful not to leave the spatula resting on your hot frying pan because the good grip handle will melt. All of these utensils are well-balanced and won't slip out of your hand. (a boon for senior citizens_"
4,Goin' for the gold,"This was a surprisingly good movie. I enjoyed Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz, which I thought was better than this movie, but I still enjoyed this one. It is a typical underdog story with a lot of laughs included. This is definately a good renter but would be a good addtion to your collection if you liked Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz."
4,"Why do movies with the words ""run whatever run"" make me cry?","I love british humor, and this movie is the best comedy I've seen all year I think. I admit the title is kind of lame and I could see why it would turn people off from watching it, but it's worth it.I cried, I laughed, I was touched, enough said. This movie also has a very good ending, it's not a sappy, slobbery love fest like almost all the other chick flicks in the world have at the end. Another thing I liked about it was it captured something real, something most movies can't ever come close to grasping because it portrays a young man struggling through something a lot of people are dealing with, most movies aren't believable now, at least not to me anyways."

1,cliche,"i actually bought the movie because of a preview of it and it was of course, a cliche. it had 2 funny moments and the kids liked it, but it was very disappointing."
2,Only for runners who would like to waste an evening,"Afte watching this I told my wife that there was nothing vaguely redeeming or original about this film if you're not a runner. So cliche, such a waste of talent. In fact, even if you are a runner you will be annoyed at some of the fantasy such as Pegg and Azaria briefly leading the race, and Pegg being featured as a national star just for drudging through the race injured.Really just a waste of time. Watch if you are sick with the flu sometime and it's free on tv."
4,"""I'm Not Fat, Just Unfit"" ~ Love For The Athletically Challenged","The '08 cinematic release ' Run, Fatboy, Run' is a quirky, British film filled with humor, dry or otherwise, and lots of heart, kind of a lighthearted 'Rocky' you might say. It's one of those girl found, girl lost, girl regained story lines that have you initially rooting against the poor smuck (Simon Pegg) who eventually wins you over and has you rooting for him at the end. Lots of good entertainment value provided by Pegg, Hank Azaria and the lovely Thandie Newton. I guess you could call this one ""Love for the Athletically Challenged""."
3,"Simon Pegg was my reason to watch, but it's no Shaun or Hot Fuzz","Run, Fatboy, Run was funny at times, but it was also generic and a little too sweet for my tastes. Simon Pegg is a natural talent and one of my favorite comic actors, but even he can't make this movie anything special. The love story has been done what seems like a million times before, but there are enough amusing moments to give it three stars. I would skip it until you can watch it for free on TV."
4,Great Romantic/Comedy that delivers in all aspects!,"A great romantic comedy that makes you think about what motivates you in life. I thought it would have been a bit more humorous from previous attempts such as Hott Fuzz and Shawn of the Dead, but the movie more than made up for it in the storyline and believable characters."
5,Get this movie,"You should really consider this movie. It is cheesy and cheeky at the same time. It is not a Oscar winning film, no. But it is a good quality, very well written and very easy to relate to type of movie. I got it on sale as well.I have yet to see anything that Simon Pegg was in that wasn't brilliant.If you take movies too seriously, this is not the best movie for you. It is a very goofy romantic comedy, definitely good for a date."
5,A picture from these days,"This movie is great, its like a picture of our days where people over 30's feel like a kid, Simon Pegg is as funny as always. Definitively the great history. If you know somebody immature, irresponsible and egoistic, you must show this film to him.As people say: nobody knows what has until lost it."
3,Not bad,"Not bad for a film directed by David Schwimmer but this is definitely not Simon Peggs best as it fails to deliver the clever British humor that we saw in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. This film felt like David Schwimmer is an Anglophile gone Director that slapped together a cute film with many funny scenes however the film dragged on with cliche twists and a predictable but satisfying ending. The use of Hank Azaria as the antagonist felt like a waste of talent, how can he take one of the funniest people and make them a villain? I found it hard to believe and I felt Hank Azaria and Simon Pegg could've had much better chemistry together. Definitely a good rental but worth buying only if you are a die hard Simon Pegg fan."
1,Would not watch again,Just really found myself bored with this movie and how it fed off actors past hits to get anyone to even watch it. Sometimes it is okay to admit that a movie is bad even if you like the people in it. Just my opinion and this movie did not appeal to know if they should make it funny or dramatic.
1,Simon Pegg Good! ...Movie Bad!,"Being a huge fan of Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz (Especially Hot Fuzz!) I was expecting more of the same brilliant British humor...Instead I suffered through another boring, predictable, 'childish-lazy-bathroom-humor' type of movie. I kept thinking, ""It has to get better"" but it never did!The jokes were extremely lame, or the humor missed completely; it was absolutely painful at times to watch. And sadly, the ""human connection"" that should be felt in a story-line such as this was totally unbelieving or non-existent.Simon Pegg is an excellent actor and he managed to ""save"" some scenes with his facial expressions and comedic timing. But sadly, all-in-all the movie left me feeling disappointed, annoyed and ripped-off!"
3,"Run, Fat Boy, Run","After the delight of 'Hot Fuzz' I was expecting great things from this film, but sadly I was left slightly disappointed. There are a few funny moments (mostly the bits that were put in the trailer!) and Dylan Moran is as great as ever, but this film failed to live up to expectation. I found it rather lack lustre, with it failing to gain any real momentum. But as far as an innocuous Sunday afternoon comedy goes you can't really go wrong. Just don't expect many, if any, belly laughs.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,30 something coming of age comedy.,"""Run, Fatboy, Run"" is a pretty funny film, some parts flat and some parts very funny. Simon Pegg plays an English ""Slacker"" like he did inShaun of the Dead, and for the most part does it almost as successfully (almost but not quite). Instead of battling Zombies to win back the love of his life, this time he is battling a successful putz to win back the love of his life and his son, similar to Jim Carrey's role inLiar Liar (Collector's Edition).""Fatboy"" won't be a comedy eveyone will love, (it isn't terribly original) but if you like Simon Pegg, and enjoy British Comedy, you sound at least like ""Run, Fatboy, Run"" I know I did.3& *"
2,Wasted Money,"I did like the treatment of ""hitting the wall"" but the rest was void of value for me.... I wn't watch it again and I definitely won't let grand kids watch it...."
4,Fun Romantic Comedy,"It's Simon Pegg - but it's not a straight up satirical comedy? Don't get thrown off too much, the movie is still a lot of fun and good ole Simon. It's entertaining, and romantic - who knew Pegg had it in him? I bought it as a gift for a friend who loves his movies and it was perfect. Not bad for your own library either."
2,Disappointed with the script,"I wanted to watch something with a gay theme. It was an okay movie. There were some fine moments portrayed by Wendy but other than that, disappointing."
4,Live And Let Life,"Travis and Rhonda made for a good romance, without the romance. Travis drags Rhonda on a mission assigned by his dead partner, but it is Rhonda who fights for a sucicidal Travis to find a reason to live. This movie is well written and directed. The actors did a good job. Travis' angst and depression are not allowed to swallow the viewer because it is matched by Rhonda's zeal, pep and vulnerable determination. This was really a good movie. No big stars. No big budget. Just a heartfelt movie that never bores and makes you care about the characters. I took a chance ang bought it because of the write up on Amazon. It was money well spent."
2,A Bit Dissappointing,"Here is a road movie about two people with nothing in common who become friends after one sees the other, naked on a bridge about to commit suicide. She finds her self drawn to him and hence follows him unexpectedly to TExas so he can go on a scavenger hunt. Sounds really neato, wacky, and oh so hip no? Well if you said ""No"" you'd be right. The friendship of these characters just appears to a certain extent. The scavender hunt is played out by listening to tapes of the mans recently deceaced boyfriend who is sending him off to heal him after his death. The emotions and reactions seem more for plot than for reality. For instance, a person in the movie will get angry and walk away although this doesn't fit with the scene, this is to set up the other person having a wacky adventure trying to find them. I watched this with a few friends and we saw what it was going for but all agreed it had really missed it's mark."
5,A fabulous compilation of the divine one!,"AMAZON, please re-release this gem! It's simply fantastic!"
3,NOT A NEW REVELATION,"THIS WAS A FAST READ, AND ENJOYABLE . HOWEVER, THE AUTHOR ADDED TO SCRIPTURE ON QUITE A FEW OF HIS EXPLANATIONS FOR QUESTIONS RAISED THROUGH THE BOOK. I WAS A LITTLE DISSAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF SCRIPTURE USED TO BASE HIS CONCLUSIONS, AND THOUGHT TOO MUCH EMPASIS WAS PUT ON WHAT COLOR THE HEROES OF THE BIBLE WERE. BECAUSE YOU ARE EGYPTIAN DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE YOU A BLACK EGYPTIAN."
1,The Hidden Secrets are really well hidden.,The Hidden Secrets must have been left out of my copy of the book.
5,Love it,"I take this with me for fishing and camping - it's light weight and vented so you don't feel over-heated, and it keeps the sun off. Perfect hat. :o)"
3,Good for one trip ONLY,"My kids had this taken apart in one trip. It would have been fun, but its a bit flimsy. The pieces would have been better if they were magnetic. I will not buy another one. Lesson learned"
3,A Young Boy Grows Up,"The premise is great, and the book moves smoothly, but it put me to sleep after a couple of pages every time I picked it up. It took five attempts to finish it. The story offers kids a valuable lesson in raising their awareness about the world around them. This is a nice introduction to teaching kids to look at the world and ask questions in their effort to ""figure it all out."" The book is designed to reach kids at their level, offering them an avenue of exploration that has no limits."
3,Meh,"Meh, This prequel was not as exciting or as memorable as the previous two but it was ok. Alice experiences the loss of her pet and the loss of a friend."
1,STUPID BOOK!,I cannot believe this author is stupid enough to write a book discussing sex for teens! How stupid can you be? How corrupt is your mind?? I would never let my child or any child read this!!! This book deserves 0 stars!
1,NOT FOR YOUR CHILD,"Parents, this book contains HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE graphic sex content. And the School Library Journal says this book is for grades 4-6??? Not in my house. My daughter was distressed after reading the explicit dialogue. Unnecessary, classless and a cheap shot, Ms. Naylor. Shame on you."
3,Out of date,"This is a well written book, as are all of Rob Sheppard's books. However, scanning has changed a LOT since the book was written. So, I would class this as a great reference, but not up with the current technology."
3,The Pain I Love You For,"Reading Teckla was agony the first time, seeing our hero brought so low in his own eyes with very little in the way of redemption granted him, other than survival. I was furious with Cawti for her betrayal, and wanted to see Kelly, that Jacobin-in-embryo, made to eat the garbage that he was flinging around. At the same time, I gave Brust huge bonus points for having the courage to write it. Now, with Phoenix, Athyra, and Issola under my belt, I am inclined to be more charitable to the original story. In these books, Vlad seems to be dying to be reborn as something greater, which the end of Issola leads us to believe will happen. I still loathe Kelly and the guillotines he would doubtless build and doubtless justify (they always do), but I admire Brust all the more for taking an easily written franchise and taking it on the road less travelled."
4,Best strategy guide ever for a game,"I'm not sure if the guy above even read the manual, but this is NOT the same thing as the manual. Most of the content in the book was written by fairly expert gamers and contains a lot of great tips learned by the players through six months of beta testing and play balancing. It won't make you an expert, but it has a lot more tips than are currently available on the net. This is way far ahead of most gaming guides."
2,An okay book but not for hardcore multiplayer fans,I love Aok and play both rm and dm multiplayer. As a hardcore fan and as someone who has a zone rating of 1750 and has played many other games not rated the guide isnt very useful. If you are a beginner its pretty good and if you like the campaigns it is good it also has some basic rules and concepts. One thing I hated is that it has no strategies for deathmatch games. I love dm and it is fast moving and has tons of battles the book has no strats and i guess you just have to learn the hard way to win like i did. I wish there was a multiplayer book with advanced strategies but oh well.
2,"Strong single-player, not so strong multiplayer content","The book is well-written, but is pretty weak in the multiplayer/online content section. I'd like to see a book written by real online gaming experts. But it has a lot of great single-player tips."
2,Tatiana Parfum,"I ordered it for my mom who`s name is Tatiana. It was a surprise for her. I`ve read a reviews and took a risk to buy it. Be honest I don`t like it at all and I have a difficulties with a UPS to return it. So, I gave it to my mom. She said it`s fine, but probably she didn`t want to disappoint me. But we are all different and you will like this scent. Who knows?"
1,poorly packaged,I can't say anything about the product itself because I bought it for a gift. It was very poorly packaged; the actual perfume box was damaged. Very disappointing because like I said before I bought it for a gift and it did not look pretty.
1,Smells like an old lady perfume,I thought since the perfume was from Diane Von Furstenbergy it would be very nice but I was wrong. I read other reviews and thought I would enjoy it. I would have returned it but I apparently you aren't permitted to return perfume because it is flamable. The perfume was too strong and not appealing at all. I ended up bringing into work and set it on a table for someone to take for free. It smelled too bad to give away as a gift.
1,This simply doesn't smell good,Once again I got sucked in by positive reviews of a product. I tried Diane VonFurstenburg's new one and fell in love but didn't want to pay the $95 for it. I was hoping that maybe one of her older ones would be just as good and would hold me until I get my boyfriend to buy me the new one for Christmas. So this one was inexpensive and had good reviews so I bought it. BIG MISTAKE. It's very strong and it just...stinks. I didn't even try to give it away. In the trash it went...
2,Perfume seemed to change in the late 80's,"I used to love this fragrance, but in the late 80's it seemed to change and I did not like it anymore. Has anyone else noticed this?I wish the original fragrance would come back, I wore it when it first came out in 1975 until about 1987 when it changed."
4,sweet spray,"a special spray.not like the common ones I used.It really suits women in love.I found coco mademoiselle fit me better.Spray means one's scent or charactor from other aspect,I think."
3,Its them before they got really good.,"Blood Brothers is my favirote band and when i bought there 3 full length albums ""This Adultery Is Ripe"",""March On Electric Children"", And ""Burn Piano Island Burn"" i decided to buy this because i really liked ""Red Blooded American Girls"" when they played it live.However this album is very bland and it has extremely poor quality.But hey its still the blood brothers so it is better than some other stuff that is out right now.Fav Tracks:""Red Blooded American Girls"" is the best track on here and ""Gagged In A Casket"" is also pretty good.Bottom Line:Pick up there other 3 albums before this one.Or Download ""Red Blooded American Girls"" and dont buy this album, its up to u."
5,Great Book on WebSphere 5.0/WSAD,"After reading this book I found that it provided the most comprehensive coverage of WebSphere 5.0Application Developer that you will find anywhere. The book style is writtenin a practical ""How TO"" - ""STEP BY"" style where each chapter has a clearexample that you can follow and run.This book clearly explains hard to find information on how to integrateMQ/MQSeries with WebSphere, which is needed to communicate with legacyapplications. In my opinion, if you are anywhere from novice to advanced user,this book will be of great value as a resource and a reference.Some of the chapters I especially thought are very well done are the Workbench,Database, EJB development, XML development, Messaging and J2EE Deployment.I highly recommend this fine book!"
2,Another Bug Ridden Technical Book,"The book is already outdated since IBM DB2 Version 7 is no longer available for download, there are no errata to use version 8. After you get DB2 v8 installed then the real problems start in ch4 with a database example that does not work (I tried it 4 times so far). The worst part is you have to build the whole thing before you find out it wont run. I hesitate to continue reading on because I dont want to waste time with non-functional code examples. Another $55.00 down the drain. Dont waste your money - stick with the samples at IBM Developer works, at least you can get support for there when there are problems."
5,Payment in Kind,"This is a pretty good read. I know I had alot of suspects, and wasn't sure who was there at the scene, and I had an idea who was the killer. Boy was I wrong!"
3,Not one of Jance's best,"Jance is just coasting in this book. There is no character development, a thin plot and an unsatisfying criminal. Quite disappointing on the whole."
5,Solid entertainment,"First I must say in response to an earlier review, no the villian is not revealed early on! I don't know how she knew, but I didn't know until the very end! This was a good book and a fast pace read. I'm not usually a big mystery reader, but I really like Jance's style and most of all I like J.P. Beaumont. He is a great main character."
3,"Decent read, not spectacular.","Payment in Kind was the first J.A. Jance book I had ever read. It was mildly enjoyable and held my attention, although honestly there's not a whole lot to recommend it. The murder itself is interesting, but there aren't any clues given for the reader to follow for themselves; there is no way to figure out the murderer, and I suppose that when I read a mystery novel, I like for there to be clues scattered about that I may or may not pick up on. Having said that, the story moved on at a decent pace, and although the writing was a bit cheesy at times (Jance seems to be straining for a ""noir"" feeling here, although she never achieves it), the book is an easy and mindless read. I may pick up another Jance book in the future, but even if I don't, I'm not sure that I'm missing all that much."
1,A mess!,"This is one of my favorite road movies, but this dvd is a mess! The problems about this video are 2: First is the fact that once we play the movie, there's a constant voiced over commentary on it, And it goes on and on while the movie is played. It took me a while to figure out I had to change the audio settings to be able to watch it. The second problem is the movie is divided in chapters and it doesn't play them all automatically. The only way to go watching it is by using the remote control to move it from one to the next chapter. Frustrating and annoying!"
2,5-Star Movie; 2-Star DVD,"This was the first non-english movie I ever watched all the way through. The story, scenes, and actors were outstanding. DVD - Why would you release a foreign language movie on DVD without an english track? Also, I had problems turning off the commentary and cannot remove the sub-titles. Wait for the lower-priced VHS to be released. The DVD is not worth the extra money."
3,Too cliche,"Montenegro is great in this movie. That said the movie is too cliche with the boudn between an adult and a little kid. We've seen many of these movies (Cinema Paradiso for example) for better Brazilian movies try ""Pixote"" or ""O que e isso companheiro"" (For days in September). For lighter fare try ""A Partilha"""
1,A pretty bad movie,"I didn't like it at all. I was specting to watch a great movie. What a deception. Even though I am a brazilian, I have to consider that LA VITA E BELLA is much much better."
5,in a world of hollywood-produced mush...,there shines the foreign-film market. i cannot wait till this film is out on video for the masses. i saw it back in feb of 99 and i absolutely loved the stunning story-line of this brasilian film. it truly is a unique film and should be seen by everyone. i'd rather go see gems like this than anything hollywood can dish out.
5,Real people,"This movie ""reads"" like a novel. It is a journey that takes the viewer from the train station of Brazil, to the slums, and all the way to ""Anonymous Paradise""--where houses are no different from each other.I watched this film at a film festival here in Manila. This is an amazing piece of work. The main protagonists (Dora and Josue) are both flawed and real.Some would probably complain that the subtitles tend to become obtrusive. However, I wouldn't want this dubbed because it might take away the value of Montenegra's performance.Rent this, buy this--hell, steal this!!!"
4,"Great story, good performance, to-be-improved direction.","Fernanda returns to the silver screen with her signature laugh/cry capability. A new star seems in the making but a better director would avoid his bad intonation (as if he is always yelling). A great support actor, at the end, plays the kid's brother. Must see the ""other"" Brazil, which is NOT the 8th largest world economy."
3,"Great movie, horrid DVD","I would give the DVD 1 star, but the movie is so good that overall I can only bring myself to knock off two stars. Why in the world is there not an option to turn off the english subtitles. In the least, they should have also included spanish subtitles. Overall, I was very disappointed that Columbia produced such an inferior product. Unbelievable."
3,Perhaps one of the finest woman's role ever written or acted!!!,"What is so unique about CENTRAL STATION is that rarely,if ever,is a woman actress called upon in a leading role as a Dickensesque Fagin-like character,hustling the public,shoplifting,child-selling and running from the law.To see Fernanda Montenegro pull this off IS WORTH THE ENTIRE FILM!!!Some performances just simply are 100% spot-on.Such is the case here.As no one else could ever be Meryl Streep's Sophie in SOPHIE'S CHOICE,so no one else could ever be Montenegro's Dora.It just simply does not get better than this.Her performance is simply arresting.You'll love Dora and you will hate Dora,but one thing's for sure-you will see Dora totally and memorably brought to life by a true actress among actresses."
4,Does she have enough passion or what?,"As a chamber musician, I drool over the chance to hear a great cello. Here is my favorite piano composer (Chopin), giving Jackie a chance to shine emotively in the Chopin. The Chopin is so beautiful, written so late in his life, and with such a poignant Largo.Being a violinist, the Franck threw me for a loop, as I'm used to it being a violin sonata, not a cello one. No matter what, it's a tremendously beautiful work. (Admittedly, though, I'm still getting used to this cello rendition).Jackie's playing is emotive, and yet at the same time it's tasteful and not overwrought. What a difficult thing to do. I guess you just have to be a natural. Oh, well, my next life..."
5,The lady is crazy,"I dont know what the lady is talking about in the last review!! I also met this guy at a book fair and he was down to earth and knew what i was looking for in a story. Something fresh and new. It should be a TV series or at least a movie or something. Keep up the fantastic work. I know the first story was geared more towards a younger crowd, but i cant wait for the sequels which have a more adult theme. I do have to say that both myself and my kids loved the stories. Their friends have also been reading the books. As to Imabookworm who says she reads alot, maybe you should learn to understand the concept behind what you are READING!"
5,Philosophically Phunny!,"This author is one of a kind: intelligent, understated, thoughtful, unique, inspired. Many of his truisms are very funny, tongue-in-cheek. Many are simply a different perspective that gives you pause. It's not ususual to find that you have heard one of his thoughts popularly quoted for years . . . without credit. :- (( Enjoy! :- ))"
4,Good Value,"This boot is a good value. Although the boot does not have the vent hole filters or Vibram sole of the more expensive boots, it will last several years and the price is great. The lightweight uppers and the sole make it an excellent boot if you do alot of walking. It gives good ankle and arch support. Be sure to keep in mind this boot runs large. If you don't plan to wear heavy socks all the time you should probably order it a size smaller than your foot size."
5,Wonderful!,"This was the first Chaplin film I'd ever seen, and I was astounded by Chaplin's genius. His physicality was simply amazing. The famous scene when he sings in nonsense French is hilarious. Paulette Goddard was stunning.A great film!"
4,THIS IS VERY SPECIAL,"This brand new Classic Collector's DVD Box Set contains Disc 1; Fully restored film on DVD; Disc 2: containing special features including behind-the-scene footage and ""making of"" documentary. A brand new and exclusive soundtrack was created specifically for this collector series containing original music selections from the motion picture. This Classic Collection also contains a commemorative booklet written by an acclaimed Chaplin biographer and a collectible Senitype; A limited edition numbered image from the film and its corresponding 35mm film frame. A must for any collector or Chaplin fan."
1,Beware: not the original version,"Before someone else has to learn the hard way, I wanted to point out that this is NOT the original theatrical release of Modern Times, but the hack-job edited version Chaplin put together later in his career to appeal to the resurgence crowd. It's rather shameful that this isn't noted on the packaging. If that's is the version you prefer, than you'll be happy. The restoration is lovely, and most of the edited parts are available as bonus features. But for those who want to see this film as it was original released, it's best to look elsewhere."
5,A brilliant silent comedy,"""Modern Times"" is one of Charlie Chaplin's most memorable films. In this movie, the Tramp joins the ranks of the unemployed, and eventually teams up with a poor girl (Paulette Goddard) who's trying to make her way in the world. Like all Chaplin films, ""Modern Times"" features numerous slapstick routines that are just as funny today as they were 80 years ago when this film was made. This is one of the first Chaplin films that uses recorded sound effects and even some spoken dialogue in the form of a nonsense song, which was Chaplin's way of lashing out at talking motion pictures. Chaplin also composed the score to this movie, which includes ""Smile,"" one of Chaplin's most famous songs. This is a truly fantastic film that people will continue to enjoy for many years to come."
1,Cleanse does not produce gall stones,"I am someone who subscribes to natural healing. I did this cleanse, but I was extremely skeptical about the hundreds of ""gall stones"" that came out. I did a lot of research, and I am 99% sure that these ""stones"" are saponified oil olive colored by bile. This blog posting on Raw for Life explains a lot:[...]"
5,Amazing Liver Flush,I have followed the cleanse several times over the last few years and I have always felt the benefits. Every cleanse has produced hundreds of stones and a wonderful increase of energy as a result. I would highly recommend everyone do a cleanse.
4,SO Thankful that I got this book!!,"I just finished my first 7 day cleanse and I am AMAZED at the results.So thankful to have this book as a resource and am looking forward to the long term health benefits that come from following the steps within.I did not give it a 5 star rating because I think he could have been clearer on the breakdown of water to salt proportions, and glasses and it got a bit confusing there. But other than that...bravo!"
5,"Forget The Chick, This Is Hugh All The Way!!!","What a beautiful Man!! Hugh Jackman is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy!Yes, film is predictable and dirivative but Hugh is ,as always, a thing of beauty and a joy forever!!"
3,Pleasant and watchable,"Yes, I bought it because of Hugh Jackman. Then enjoyed the glimpse of the outback, and the sweet story of people growing in love because they like each other. Interesting that despite its being a ""romance"" the woman had a job, and a non-traditional one as well. Nice supporting performances and gorgeous scenery added benefits."
5,Too short! But wonderful!,"Wow! What a great series! I am truley sad that there is only one season of this Gundam series, as this is definantly one of the best in the Universal Century timeline.This series follows Amuro-...er...Shiro Amada and his squad of MS pilots otherwise known as the 08th MS team. Shiro, being a brand new leutenant in the E.S.F.S. (I think.) must prove himself to be a competant leader for his squad. Having next to no experience but a keen sense of duty and a little luck allows him to show his teamamtes what he is all about. However, the REAL theme of the series does not really become known until about half-way into the story. Allegiance and the idea of what an enemy is seems to be key plots in the story.Without a doubt, this is one of the best Gundam series ever made."
3,Solid RPG with a lot of potential.,"Make you own worlds, create your own quests, Control and run your own RPG online server, what more can you ask for? Nice quality graphics, sound effects, and music. Easy to setup and play alone, or as an online Multi-Player RPG. Great investment for any RPG fan..."
3,Hellrazor,"This is a great concept but built to light duty for profesional use. I broke the end off the handle in no time. I then bought the Trogan pv30, much heavier duty and better suited for pro's."
2,amateur,"i bought this soundtrack after watching the movie and hearing a couple clips of music that sounded interesting. well, just like the movie, it was a huge disappointment. the lyrics are dull to no end, and the music is cheesily amateur.the only bright spot on the album is the opening track, sung by paulie perrette's band lo-ball. but again, the lyrics are really weak and don't live up to the sound of the song."
3,dark and dank,"I bought this book as I thought there would be some practical exercises included to attain states of altra-consciousness. Most of the book (more than half) consists of the author explaining and justifying why you should use his approach to magic. The last 1/3 is his ""how-to"" which breaks down to fight as much as you can, have as much sex as you can, and consider flagellating yourself so as to experience rapture.Some of his psychology is accurate. But for the most part this book was not helpful to me. It is dark. My intuitive reaction was that this is not the path (at least not for me).That said if you are a ""HE-man"", into combat, into kinky, have an affiliation to Norse mythology or are just dark yourself, this might be the book for you."
4,great book,This is a great book. It has a lot of ideas. A must read for anyone wanting to delve into the left hand path
4,"Budget recording - not very good, but the only one available","This bargain-basement recording has more than its share of shortcomings. A competent but uninspired performance of the Saint-Saens is by far the highlight. But Britten's _Ceremony of Carols_ is sung in German instead of the original Middle English, and it comes off as something of a fiasco.The absence of liner notes means that you won't know what the choir or soloist is singing at any given time, so much of the subtle word-painting will be lost on most listeners. All vocal soloists are unidentified.I've recommended this recording only because it is at present the only one of the Saint-Saens available. But it's high time for something better. Naxos, are you listening?(Update, October 2008: The last paragraph was true six years ago, but thankfully it is no longer so.)"
3,Competent but uninspired,"There is nothing wrong with these performances other than they are uninspired, that they quickly become backgroung music you don't really hear. If you don't already know and like the Oratorio and Ceremony of Carols, these performances won't make you love them."
5,beautiful recording!,"I don't find anything wrong on these recording. Both the Christmas Oratory and Britten's carols are beautifully performed.It is of special interest Saint-Saens Christmas Oratory since personally, I had never heard it before, but after listening to it I can fully recomend it."
1,Batteries Dead with phone,Phone looks great and looks to have alot of features but the batteries that come with it to charge in the phone itself never charge making is useless. When I plugged it in the awsering machine was set to 2003 so I think because it's this old the batteries are long dead. I bought it here on amazon for 19 bucks new including shipping but if I had it to do all over again I would never have bought it. This time around I'll go to buy a new one at walmart or kmart knowing that it's new and the batteries for it aren't around 10 years old.
4,Very Important Book to read,"This book is truly special. It describes exactly what a ""Christian"" family does to ""change"" a gay son. Very well written, lots of emotions. A very good book."
3,"Content 5 Stars, Format 1 Star - Averages out","Lewis Carroll's contents timeless and fundamental and should be interesting to anybody with interest in Symbolic Logics or even simple logical problem solving.However, I am kicking myself for not looking at the published year and having been fooled by the snazzy cover into assuming that the presentation would be of contemporary standards. It is ditto reproduction of fonts and pagination from the original, which a contemporary reader would have a tough time keeping up. Just look at the Table of Contents befor you buy."
3,kindle user in Asia,"I bought a kindle DX, and registered. Now I can not download books from Amazon.cn, for it only support iPad or Android user, and can not download from Amazon.com, for it do not support Asia user. what a pity to be an Asian Kindle user!"
1,Locks up Kindle,"As other users have been saying, it locked up my Kindle as well. I got the Project Gutenberg version here (also free, of course):[...]and it seems to be working just fine."
1,Horrible,"There is only one thing I like about its recording, the orchestra. Dramatic idiom at its best, with the London Phil. But Kennedy is VERY messy especially in the third movement with his spicatto, its very uneven. Also, in the third movement, the passage of sixteenths with randomn octaves is so horrible out-of-tune I can't bear to listen to this recording. Much of the time, you cna't even hear the violin, it is subdued, exactly the antithesis of what Elgar meant for this concerto - for the violin to be a story teller. Well, the ""sage"" must be on something, because it is soooo sloppy. As a concert violinist I know these things. Don't buy this recording. Menuhin's his okay (he has a great tone), Heieftz is to apathetic, Zukerman takes to many liberties and cheats by not playing certain octaves - I hear that Hahn has made a recording. Shaham will make one soon, I hope. But until now, i haven't heard a very solid interpretation of this lovely and haunting concerto."
5,Gloriously played....,I have heard several recordings of this work over the years but this is my favorite. This is playing of pure passion and poetry...at times it brings tears to the eye...and Handley provides wonderful support. Wonderful disc!
5,Um...Uhhh....Ahhhh....Uhhhh...Ehhhh....UUMMM!!!!!!,"Yep. Thats how i sounded after listening to this album. I was reduced to stuttering out random sounds like a bafoon. As soon as i popped it in my cd player it made me want to quit playing guitar right there. There's no other way to describe it other than extremely technical post-hardcore. From the first track to the second to last, Protest The Hero keep you wanting more. The only drawback is ""Plateful Of Our Dead"" is a bit weak. An Amazing album nonetheless. Crushing breakdowns, INSANE guitar riffs, and technicality that would make Eddie Van Halen confused, and all at a blistering pace that literally beats you down and steals your wallet. All, while picking you back up and leaving you wanting more. These guys are right on par with other greats such as The Recieving End Of Sirens. I would love to see a concert with TREOS and PTH! So pick this cd up and enjoy!"
4,Some sweet tunes,"i got this after witnessing Heretics & Killers on the metal hammer dvd, had never heard of these guys before, and i was blown away by the whole cd, its really refreshing to hear a songer not afraid to go after those high notes, and sme seriously sweet riffs and beats."
5,A great album,Very impressive. Excellent guitaring and vocals. Great time signature changes. They sound nothing like Avenged Sevenfold. More of Coheed and Cambria style of vocals but much harder music.
5,Virtuoso's,"Heres a completely unexpected album. Protest the Hero blew me away when i first heard ""Nautical"" on purevolume. It was technically proficient, and gave me that awesome feel you get when you hear something genuinely cool. I bought their cd the other day, and listenning to the whole thing, I instantly decided that this is one of my favorite cd's of all time. Every song feels epic and has constant time change ups. And dont even get me started on the drum work....this guy is tight. If you are a fan of Avenged Sevenfold's ""Waking the Fallen"", then you will definetaly love this. I think a new sub-genre of ""epic-metal"" has began. Buy this cd."
3,"Second verse, same as the first...","This book was similar to the others in the series. Really, if you've read one, then you've read them all. However, that doesn't mean the book was bad. It was a nice bit of light romance. I enjoy this author's style of writing--it's light; it's humorous; it is optimistic and happy. Sometimes that's what I want in a romance."
2,Bad and then more Bad,How can anyone say this book was good. I love to read romances and have for a long time. But this book was so boring that I had to finish it hoping it would get better. I don't like to start one and then stop. I figure to give it a chance but it didn't get better. I couldn't even get interested in either character although the 2 stars I gave it were for the other characters in the book. When I got to the ending hoping against hope it was going to be a great ending. Should have known better. The ending left you hanging which reminded me of a book that a man wrote that I once read. It will not make me buy the next one. I think the author should give up writing. Or maybe she needs to read others to see how it is done. Say Rachel Gibson or Sherryl Woods.Don't buy this book. It is a waste of time and money.
5,Fantastic Story and series,"I haven't written a review in a while, mostly because I haven't read anything I really liked. This book had me going from cover to cover. I can't wait to read the third book and find out what happened to all Ms. Mccoy's fabulous character. I don't understad how anyone could say the story was boring. It was unique and very touching.Twin boys, a hunky hero, intrigue, a sweet heroine, jeesh, what more could you want?"
1,"If you enjoy the sound of static, buy this!!","The sound quality is so poor in this recording that it is difficult at best to enjoy. I suppose if you play your music at extremely low volume, or are used to listening on a poor quality stereo (think victrola sound), then maybe you could get past the static noise. Quite a shame, considering what a masterfully performed, complete set this makes."
4,A must have,"I was gifted this book by a dog loving friend who knew that I'd love it. And I did. While I found moving around it hard at times - the author knew what she was talking about so sometimes everything wasn't in the sequence I would have liked it explained to me. However, it is all there. I wish I'd had this book or excerpts from it when I bought my first dog 11 years ago. I did my best as an owner, but after reading Jean's book it became apparent that my lack of knowledge about the true nature of dogs meant I was wandering around in a wilderness - and unfortunately so too were my beloved pooches. Not an easy read but worth perservering - there are gems in this book that need to reach a wider section of dogdom. The sooner the better for both species!"
5,A must-read for dog owners and lovers!,"Finally, a book the de-romanticizes dog motivations and behavior and allows us to get an honest look into the minds of our beloved companions. I am a much better dog owner now that I have read this book, and isn't that the best possible outcome?"
2,Impractical guide for most aggressive dogs,Desensitizing dogs with distraction and extremely gradual socialization is a joke for most owners with aggressive behaviour dogs.The problem with this its impossible to control the environment around the dog sufficiently to control its exposure.It is unrealistic to expect a dogs to be buddy's with every dog that passes by.Too many trainers are hyping tactics designed to increase their puppyclass sizes instead of practical advice for walking a dog for exercise.This book is great advice e for owners with way too much time.
4,Makes you want to get up and train your dog!,"I liked most of this book, but was bothered by a few flaws. Donaldson seems to have a good intuitive understanding of dogs, which is probably why she can train so well and use clicker training so effectively. I enjoyed her insights into dog behavior and how dogs and people are truly different creatures. I was less convinced by the later chapters addressing specific training issues, more because they didn't seem to be follow in any particular order. I also am not quite as convinced as she is that dog's are 100% Skinnerian, behaviorally oriented beings.If you're particularly sensitive about your relationship with your pets, you may find Donaldson's attitude a bit off-putting. I found it humorous, and sometimes a little helpful to know just how silly I'd been."
1,Very unprofessional!,"Author seems unaccredited and ignorant. She is forcing her opinion on us without any concrete facts. While I agree with her on most topics, they are just plain common sense. But it would be a better book if she had facts and statistics to back up her claims.Please do not use the word ""cuz""; do not use more than 1 exclamation point, or random capitalization.This book is very hard to read. It is hard to decipher whether she is for or against something, it varies from paragraph to paragraph.I only read this, for a class."
1,Too technical,Because I do not have a degree in dog psychology I found this book to be very difficult to understand. If the author had written it to the common dog owner it would have been useful. I'll donate my copy to the library and maybe I can re-claim my loss.
5,This is the quintessential book on dog training. Period.,"There's vitually no book I have not read when it comes to training your dog or getting into your dog's head. And this is the best, it has no rivals.But it should be pointed out that this book is fairly geared towards those who compete w/ their dogs, this is not a book for those owning their first dog and are requiring the knowledge of the basics. If you are not up on the 'lingo' of dog competition or do not have a thorough grounding in 'Dog Psychology 101' you'll probably find yourself lost.However, that being said, I refer to this book again and again as it brought me light years ahead in the way I train my dogs. I compete in both Conformation and Obedience and I use every bit of what I learned in both fields.The only real complaint I have is that 'The Culture Clash' spoiled me tremendously. Every book I have read since has been a tremendous let-down.Bottom line? If you want to get inside the canine mind, this is the book to buy."
4,Interesting Insights into Dogs and Dog Training,"I found this book (1st Edition) poorly organized and badly written. However, if you're a solid reader who can get past these obstacles, this is otherwise a GREAT BOOK.Donaldson added greatly to my understanding of my dog and what I've been doing wrong in training him. It was a little off-putting at first, because her views of what dogs are -- and why they respond to us -- are so different from the views I'd previously held. Still, if you want to understand your dog, and get him to mind you too, this is an important read."
1,A bad author with good ideas,"Jean Donaldson is the most arrogant, condescending, and insulting author I've ever read. If you read this book BEFORE owning a dog you're safe but anyone who has had dogs in the past should be prepared to be attacked for past ""sins"".Donaldson's ideas are terrific. Her methodology is completely logical- she doesn't need to resort to name calling to convince readers that she's right. Obviously we're reading the book because we're looking for a new way of doing things, we don't need to be scolded on every page for the way we used to do things (which by the way was taught to us by professionals like Donaldson - if anyone deserves to be scolded it's her own colleagues!)If you're like me, and have trained dogs in the past using the ""method du jour"", I'd skip this book and find a different Positive Reinforcement book."
1,The Culture Clash,"I have read many books on dogs. This is by far the worst. It may have some good information in it if you can stomach reading through all the negativity. I grew very tired of reading how ""stupid"" us people are. She literally repeatedly used the word stupid and I found it insulting to the point that I quit reading the book and I am returning it to the bookstore. Any useful information would be difficult to refer back to due to the fact that the table of contents is so vague. You have to read through information that I found tiresome because I don't have any interest, for example, in reading in detail how to teach my dogs to play tug of war. Jean Donaldson has very strong opinions, and as you can see, I have very strong opinions about the negative way that she chose to write her book."
1,Methodology Clash,"The Culure Clash by Jean Donaldson can be broken up into three parts:The first of which is a statistical rendering of dog psychology which, to me, is very dry. Although well written, the first several chapters do little to actually shed any light on what really motivates canines or how to predict their behavior. The second third of the book over-emphasizes the need to positively reinforce behavior with treats and walks to the point where the text degenerates into kindergarten-level drivel. The third portion of the book seems to have been written with a thesaurus in hand, citing the pitfalls of under-socialized dogs while never advising any useful socialization techniques for adult dogs. Given the high accolades afforded to this book and the recommendation to read it given by trusted dog trainers, I was disappointed in the lack of useful content.The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs"
5,"If you buy only one dog book in your life, this would be it!","By understanding the mind of dogs, I am better able to train my own! Previously I believed that my dogs were out to please me, but now I understand that ""they are looking out for No.1!"" I've already learned the joy of clicker training, and her use of positive training kept me glued to the book. I've found this book particularly helpful in working with rescue dogs."
1,Figuring the right approach while my dog faces death,"I have found the reviews to this book very telling. Let me say up front, I have not read this book. But I am using a behaviorist from the most reputable vetrinary school in this region. Since my initial consultation, my dog has attacked me numerous times, biting me two times severely. He challenges me constantly.I am medicating my dog with Paxil, although there are no efficacy studies for aggressive dogs. The trainer who called all this stuff a ""fad"" in his review of this book is voicing my fears when I started this ""non-violent"" technique. If my dog could laugh, he would laugh at me when I drag him to his quiet room after he attacks me.Maybe for some dogs, the new ""non-violent"" approach works, but for highly aggressive dogs, I believe this approach might be very dangerous to the owner and fatal to the dog.And I am sick of trainers dismissing the other techniques as dated, or cruel, or medievel."
1,"Female late teens from Dallas, TX","When I read this book I felt I was being lectured to. The author seemed to think that only she knew the right way to train dogs. She presented a good argument for what she said but there were so many contradictions in her book that I became confused and doubtful. The reviews to the book on amazon.com were so different it added to my confusion. The good part is that it caused me to do more reading to understand what was being said. I found other books that spent all their time telling how wonderful their way of training was with little or no practicle advice. The books that helped to get a better understanding and didn't spend all their time saying how wonderful they are were written by Carol Benjamin, The Monks of New Kete, Karen Pryor and a new author Captain Haggerty who is very funny and explains so many different things."
5,It really works,"I lend out lots of books to friends and neighbors. This is the only one I make sure is returned. Within a few weeks of bringing our shelter pup home, she was agressive and totally out of control. Among other problems, the choke collar seemed to enrage her and I couldn't figure our why! After reading this book I RAN out and bought a halti harness and a huge bucket of treats. The results of positive reinforcement and intensive food reward training were immediate and dramatic. Now the days of choke collars and alpha rollovers are are in the past and I think (I hope) my pup has forgiven me for my bad judgement. I can't reccomend this book strongly enough. I feel like it has allowed me to understand my dog (as much as a human can)."
1,Horrible!,"I am furious at myself that I wasted my money on this book! And, I bought it on Nook, so it's nonrefundable. The money would've been better spent buying my dog some treats! Reasons for not liking? Almost all that are listed as a one star here.The reading is hard to follow, the author comes off as condescending, the philosophy is bogus, etc. The only reason I bought it was due to a suggestion from a friend."
5,positive dog training,"Great book on positive dog training! It was a very fast read, very interesting and gave a lot of insight to how many people treat their dog and how people actually should treat their dogs. The book explained how people generally are interpreting what their dogs are thinking to mean the wrong thing, and how we actually should read those behaviors. There are a lot of examples throughout the book on ideas for training dogs, and then a chapter on basic behavioral training at the very end."
3,"It's okay, but there are better options.","The book presents Dog training the right way, uses the correct methods and provides good information, but there are contradictions and ideas about cognitive abilities of dogs that simply do not bare scrutiny. This was required reading for a program I am taking, although slightly better writing than Karen Prior's efforts and far less condescending, the writing is self serving and lacks the science to back the claims made by the author in some areas. Most of the writing has been covered before and better. Most trainers have a personal style, bias, and experience that contribute to their own take on training but generally speaking there are not many different ways to teach sit, stand, down and wait, this book is no different, if you've read a good book on positive training you can likely skip this one as it offers nothing 'new'."
5,Great read and invaluable insight!!!,"The first edition of this book was the basis for training my now 8 year old dog. Using her methods and insights, my husband and I raised the best behaved and happiest dog I know (I'm not biased or anything :). But that aside, her points were pivotal in our mindset in raising our dog. I read everything out when we decided to get a puppy and Jean's book was the easiest read and best book to guide our training. My husband still refers to her book 7 years later. We've loaned it out so many times that it's dog-eared. I'm so glad she's put out a 2nd edition because the last person never returned my original. We've got a new puppy to raise and I'm so glad I'll have the latest edition to brush up my mindset. Ignore the bad reviews, Jean has written a classic, must-read for dog owners who truly want to understand their dogs and train them the right way."
3,take what you want from it and leave the rest,"Has some good concepts and some I don't agree with. and it could use some updating. ""Take what you want and leave the rest"""
1,Just opinions & where is the science?,"After reading just 10 pages, I decided that it would be waste of my time to read more. First, she states that dogs are incapable of observational learning. Well, I just wrote an article that talks about observational learning in dogs by citing scientific peer review journals. So, J. Donaldson didn't get that right. Perhaps the research about observational learning in dogs came after she wrote Culture Clash. Second, she states that dogs are incapable of abstract thinking, etc. Now, how does she know that? I doubt that there is any research to date that is able to tap into a dog's cognition. Studying human cognition is complicated enough. But dogs? Anyway, for someone who is into science, this book is a disappointment."
3,Wade through the muck to find the good info...,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews of this book that criticize the tone and disorganization. Donaldson's hypocritical diatribes against any sort of training that does not agree with her's is distracting and unprofessional. Additionally her militant ""positive-only"" philosophy is just as much based on outdated theories as dominance theory is.I'm always wary of experts who spend more time criticizing than providing info to back up their claims.That having been said, there is a lot of good information in this book...especially for someone who is about to get a new dog. I especially appreciated the information she provided about dog bites and animal behavior. Too often people adopt cute puppies, and expect them to miraculously be social, friendly furry little humans. When they become unruly adolescents, they are surrendered or euthanized."
1,Condescention Clash,"Ms. Donaldson's book drips of condescension. For example, on page 61 she tells the reader to ""pound this into your brain: dogs are animals.""If you think your dog is a person, and you need a pompous author to point out to you over and over that it is not, this is your book.If you are a dog lover who wants to develop healthy and fun behaviors between you and your dog, every other book out there is a better choice.In addition to the number of wonderful dog training books out there I recommend you consider reading Stanley Coren's book ""How to Speak Dog"". He will explain all the things the dogs ears say by their various postions, he will explain the meaning of head position, tail movement, lip curl, etc. Mr Coren is respectful to both animals and to readers.His book is especially valuable when you see your dog interact with other dogs. No book on training will tell you what your dog is thinking like Mr. Coren's."
5,Review of Arthur's Celebration,"This is a bargain for those who enjoy the TV series. You get 4 episodes for the price of three. Great family viewing. In this DVD you get: (1) Arthur's Birthday-about Arthur and Muffy's conflict when both decide to have their birthday celebrations on the sameday; (2) Arthur's New Year's Eve-about Arthur, Grandma Thora, and D.W.'s celebration of New Years Eve; (3) Grandma Thora's Appreciation Day-about Arthur and D.W.'s planning and putting on Grandma Thora's Appreciaton Day, only Thora doesn't know about it, and they forget to invite her; (4) D.W.'s Perfect Wish-about D.W. birthday celebration taking her from preschool years to Kindergarten, and her perfect birthday wish, much to Arthur's dislike."
4,Classic Forties Noir,"If 1940's mystery noir is what you like then this is a good book for you. It has an attorney mixed up in a murder mystery involving an mysterious brunette, a blonde bombshell and a mean broadway producer. Lots of guessing whodunit and the hero seems to keep getting himself in deeper. It is an easy enjoyable read."
2,"Tame, dull video","After such hot releases as ""Playboy's Freshman Class"" and ""Blue Collar Babes"", I expected better from Playboy than this. It does have some very sexy girls, but almost all the scenes are nothing but girls alone on screne dancing. There is vaguely implied lesbianism in two scenes, but nothing nearly as sexy as in other recent videos. Even the single-girl scenes are very tame by current standards. This video might be a good Playmate-style feature, but it's certainly not worthy of the ""Erotic Adventures"" title."
1,Entirely too much salt,"I tried this product when it was marketed under another brand and found it to be quit good, even recommending it to a friend. This iteration is entirely too salty.A note to Frito Lay - This is a chili mix, not Frito's. Adjust the salt level accordingly."
3,good film beware animal cruely,It looks like a good film. Two men trapped on a base camp for trapping. One is them is an unhinged macho type. Of course he is trying to push one of them over the edge. I got nervous about having to watch animal cruelty because of course the other man cares about women and the sled dogs . It began to get ominous and a peep at the title of a low review here warns of animal cruelty so I will. However it IS a well acted and scripted film.A comment under a one star review here states a real dog was brutally beaten and screaming in pain for the sake of filming. People aren't so stupid they don't get insinuation so why film it for real. ? In fact what is imagined tends to be worse so there is no excuse. I can't see the difference between censoring straight-up porn. for films geared for the general public and it being illegal to inflict pain on animals for the sake of movie-making.
2,Oh my god,"Saw the film yesterday. Thought it would be a kind of adventurous trapper-film. It isn't. It's a nervewrecking psychotrip. You won't stop for almost 2 hours wishing for Randtaeds (one of the trapper) death. Hard to stand through the film. I wouldn't recommend it for adventure-film-freaks. Frankly it's boring. Still it's not a ""bad"" film. But I bet: noone ever saw that film twice. One time is more than enough. We're all happy... very happy, that Randstaed finally died. What an idiot. Oh my god."
2,be forewarned,"This was depressing and confusing and utterly unredeeming. And those are its good qualities. The first half hour shows promise; the rest of the movie fails to deliver anything but...depression and confusion, and again, there is nothing, no character, nothing, that is in any way redeeming. Utterly bleak. And did I mention confusing? You get the idea."
3,Vegetarian Times magazine,"I sent the Vegetarian Times magazine as a gift and it renewed it self with out me realizing it.Please do NOT renew it again.Thanks, Jayne Guntherwas sent to Melissa Ogunsuyi in CT"
2,still waiting,I have been waiting for my magazine to arrive in the mail. Just wondering why it is taking so long.
1,Disappointment.,"I ordered a subscription to this magazine at the very beginning of January, 2011 and have yet to recieve a single copy. It is now March 18. I am very disappointed in this waste of money."
3,Way over the Top,"I ordered this magazine because I wanted good vegitarian recipes to try out. I was not prepared for all the anti-meat, anti-killing animals, and anti-anything except for vegitarianism. The recipes are great, the content and editorial junk is not."
3,Shame on you,"Shame on you. This is the second time you have tried to ""automatically"" renew my subscription to this magazine. I spend over an hour on the phone trying to cancel this automatic review. You finally tell me it will not be renewed and now I get yet another automatic renewal. Do not renew this subscription! The magazine is very nice but your sales tactics are very undesirable. CANCEL THIS SUBSCRIPTION OR I WILL CANCEL ALL AFFILIATION WITH YOU. Do NOT automatically renew anything for me, especially when you give no option to cancel an automatic renewal. Pam Westbrook"
2,eating is not a religion,"Vegetarian Times is an OK magazine. The recipes are expensive and time consuming. If your obsessed with your diet and being a vegetarian with a preachy, in your face, pin a medal on my chest attitude you will love the magazine. I simply don't eat meat, not practice an extreme religion."
1,Rediculously slow!,"The one start rating is for Amazon, NOT the magazine. I purchased my subscription the first week in September. It is now December and I am still getting emails from Amazon that the subscription has been delayed. From now on I am going to the Vegetarian Times website and ordering it direct. Love the magazine!"
2,"Okay for students, novice cooks. Lacks any depth","In my opinion the more advertising in a magazine, the less you can trust its content. I didn't do an ad pages check but I imagine Vegetarian Times is about 75% ads. I primarily picked it up for the low cost investment ($7) to inspire some vegetarian meals and it satisfied that goal. However, between the ads and ""lifestyles advice"" soundbites there are painfully few actual recipes and approaches to cooking and even many of those are hawking merch from the advertisers (e.g., ""1 30-oz can Muir Glen Crushed Tomatoes, 2 cans Eden Organic Beans""). As an experienced cook and conscious consumer, I find this unsettling. It's not a BAD magazine, per se, just kind of a waste. You're better off buying ANY vegetarian cookbook, even if you don't know how to cook, and flipping through this at the store (you can read all the lifestyle tips in 3 minutes)"
3,"Too many ads, too little content","I like the content in Vegetarian Times just fine, but there are so many ads that almost half the pages are full page ads (This is in addition to smaller ads on other pages). I know that the ads help pay for printing the magazine, but it's ridiculous to have so little content vs the advertising."
4,very good,Very Good. Lot's of good info. Good Ads and good article's. Like a lot. A Very good Mag. Buy it you will like it.
4,Vegetarian Times,I have gotten some great recipes to serve my vegetarian granddaughter and my vegan grandchildren. The illustration photos are beautiful and instructions are clear.
3,Some good recipes,"I'm not a vegetarian anymore, but I am a very healthy eater and love to eat vegetables, so I thought Vegetarian Times would be a great source of new recipes for me. It was okay, but Eating Well definitely gave me more recipes I can use. I've only received one issue so far, and found very few recipes that inspired me to tie on an apron and turn up the music in my kitchen. Perhaps it was just this issue, since it did feature a fairly large section on ""live foods"" and I've never been a big fan of the raw food movement. Give me my veggies sauteed and broiled, roasted or boiled! I'm looking forward to future issues and expect I will find quite a few recipes I can use, but for me, Eating Well magazine is a much better investment."
4,A nice surprise,"Let me start by saying I'm not a vegetarian, (and don't plan to be) however I do think we all eat entirely too much meat. I'm working hard to incorporate one meatless meal a day into my lifestyle. I ordered Vegetarian Times just to get some ideas and after receiving my first issue, I was inspired. I've made quite a few recipes and really enjoyed them, but more than that it got me thinking differently. Yes, parts of it are a little hippy-dippy, but I find most of the articles interesting and what doesn't suit me, I skip. I definately recommend it."
2,Vegetarian Times magazine,"It is difficult to rate something that I ordered on 02-17-10 and still have not received--not one copy! It has been over two(2) months now, and I believe that that is more than sufficient time for my subscription to arrive because Amazon said six(6)to eight(8) weeks arrival time. I am a dissatisfied customer at this point. Thank you."
1,Didn't get the magazine.,I'm writing this on April 1st. and I orderd on Feburary 18th. Still haven't received an issue.
1,Have not received the product,"I can not review this purchase yet, because I have not received a copy of the magazine as yet"
2,Disappointing,"As a vegetarian, and a busy person, I thought subscribing to the Vegetarian Times would provide me with a few meal ideas. Most-if not all-of these recipes call for rare/difficult to find ingredients, and a lot of prep work! Not to mention that most of these meal recipes didn't exactly look appetizing most of the time. It just wasn't for me. The articles weren't interesting, and the interviews were short and pointless. If you're looking for something to provide you with quick and easy meal ideas, I'd go with a cookbook."
1,50% advertisement!!!,i was looking forward to this subscription for the recipes but this magaizine is at least 50% advertisement and for the price it should have a LOT less!! i will not resubscribe very disappointed!!
2,It's erm okay...,"Just so that you know off the bat, the magazine is full of ADs. There's about one AD for every one and a half to two pages. This can get bothersome as the Magazine is rather short.But from what i was able to read, the information and recipes are great!Just wish there was more content and less ADs"
4,great magazine,"Great magazine. I highly recommend it for anyone eating / cooking vegetarian. I began eating vegetarian about a year ago, and my wife has been using this magazine a lot for cooking inspiration."
4,Fun and Informative Magazine,"I have been a subscriber for a long time. I really like their website and recipe search feature as well. Also really like their how to's, and that they label stuff, vegan, gf, etc... Wish they focused a little more on vegan offerings, or else I would give 5*... but will definately resubscribe once i am due."
1,VEGETARIAN TIME,"HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET, SO WHEN i GET ONE i CAN LET YOU KNOW. tOO BAD COULD NOT GET SHIPPED TO CANADA"
3,Nice for a new recipe here and there,"I am a vegetarian and I like finding new recipes. I like this magazine for that reason. I really like the pictures, too."
2,Have not received yet.,"Since I have not received my magazine subscription yet, I cannot review the magazine. I was told it would take 2 to 3 months to receive it. Not sure why so long."
2,Somewhat of a rip-off.,"I've been a vegetarian for 14 years, and always saw this magazine in my local Whole Foods so I decided to give it a try, as I'm always looking for new recipes. I so very disappointed. The recipes are so-so, and the already thin magazine is LITERALLY half ads. I actually counted. Page of recipe/article, full page of ads....with the exception of a page or two, it was literally 50/50.I'll stick to looking online for new recipes."
1,Do not buy it!!!,"1 It takes forever to arrive.2 NOT %100 VEGETARIAN.3 TOO focus on the political ethic of killing animals( I do care for the animals but its a magazine a about recipes not about animals)4 LOTS of pages full of products that are not vegeterian like a carnivore is going to be buying this magazine.5 Steps to cook are not the right ones .Overall just DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY YOU CAN FIND BETTER RECIPES AND FASTER ONLINE , OR YOUTUBE ."
5,Love This Magazine,"Just received my first issue of the magazine, and I really like it. My family is not vegetarian, but we do have frequent vegetarian meals in an effort to be more healthy. There are lots of recipes with very nice pictures. And they look fairly simple to make, especially for people who are on the go."
3,Informative Magazine,"I've been a subscriber of this magazine for many years. It's an important tool for vegetarian cooking, but a good resource for non-vegetarians as well. It has limited recipes for vegans, but most non-vegan recipes can be altered. The price was right for this magazine, at full price I would not have ordered a subscription."
4,Not Bad For the Price,"I purchased the cane for daily use. It works as advertised, clipping to tables and such.My only complaint is that the strap is too short to go around my large hands and was held on by a flimsy aluminum tab which broke during the first day of use. I plan on buying a new more robust strap for the cane as I like it very much. Also,it would be nice if they mentioned what size replacement tips will be needed as I probably will need to change it in a couple of months. Again, not bad for the price. Almost forgot, don't let the picture fool you, the canes main body is plain aluminum in color, not black like the picture would make you believe. It would have been nice to have the whole cane be black in color."
3,LCD display problem,Recieved the new Boston radio and seemed to work fine.Within 2 minutes the LCD display was not readableSound quality was good
2,Love Me Daddy,"A killer for a local mob boss, who is also the goon's surrogate daddy, kills his way through a long tedious book. There is time out for a little love interest with a woman who understands and aids his need to sow lethal mayhem whenever his ""daddy"" tells him to. Bloody meaningless shootouts (not fully explained), continue as the Miami mob trys to take over ""dad's"" Orlando territory. Our hero starts looking for ""dad"", who has gone missing, with lethal results for scores of unknown and meaningless characters. Its a one dimentional tale that never caught my interest. Unless you enjoy keeping track on your abacus of an ever rising body count with no interesting tale attached, give this one a bye for your own good. Life is too short to waste your time on books like this."
2,"Good, but illogical thriller","I agree with the reviewer below. This is an OK thriller, but the illogical actions of the ""hero"" ruin any realism. He spends much of the book on the run yet continues to return to a location he deemed unsafe (his mom's house) - this makes no sense. And too often, incidents are initiated for dramatic effect, yet never followed up on or referenced again in any true manner (the run in with the FBI agents in the car and the resulting aftermath is one example). Overall, a quick read but with no depth and requires a complete suspension of belief and logic. Perhaps with his second book, the author will plot a novel that entraps the reader, instead of constantly losing us through careless plotting."
5,A Great Read,"A very nice blend of Richard Stark, Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen ... hopefully we'll be hearing more from Mr. Gischler."
2,"Shallow, shallow, shallow","I like fast paced, violent crime novels, but Gun Monkeys is one of the most forgettable books I have ever read. Victor Gischler throws his main Character, Charlie Swift, at you with zero background, zero personality, and zero likeability. Swift is about as deep as a puddle of water, dumb as a bag of hammers, and as likeable as an out of control Rotweiller.I didn't care what happened to Charlie, I didn't care about his boss...I really didn't care about anything in this book. The best way to put it is the whole thing feels forced, like it is written by someone who wished they could have been a gangster, but in reality learned everything they knew from watching the Sopranos. Every time I picked this book up, I had to go back a page or two to remember what was going on; It is that forgettable."
1,These are a joke!,"Not low-draw voltage. Even if they say they are. Luckily we have two batteries. Within 20 minutes of use, we were dead in the water.The lights only projected about 7 feet of light on the water.And for marine lights, they should be pretty water tight. These were installed on our pontoon boat, roughly 2 1/2 feet off the water, in a place that only gets splashes of water (no worse than a sprinkle rain). The lenses have condensation... again, 20 minutes of use.These things are awful. If you want ""docking lights"" you need more than 7 feet of visability.... Buy a spot light, these were awful. I did give them one star though, because they turned on. HAHAHA"
4,A Good Read!,"Jerry L. Fletcher and Kelley Olwyler examine how you use paradoxical thinking - contradictory ways of approaching a situation. Then, they discuss ways to use your paradoxes to your strategic advantage. You can use their ""pendulum"" to help you recognize the positive and negative ways you express these paradoxes - so you can apply the positive actions to difficult situations. They invite readers to analyze themselves and resolve a current problem. The book can help you devise more creative solutions to personal and work situations. However, while the system is fairly straightforward, elements do seem complicated and may be difficult to apply on your own. We [...] recommend this book as a novel approach to problem solving and a worthy way to regard goal setting without the nagging voice of consistency in your ear."
4,Learn to play the Jorma way !,"Having always been a fan of Jorma Kaukonen and Hot Tuna, I was searching for an instructional video program that would teach me the Jorma style. Not only did I find what I was looking for, but Jorma teaches his style himself! A must have for all guitar playing Hot Tuna fans."
1,Not impressed with this product.,"I bought this for sore muscles. Does not do a thing, like putting on regular hand lotion and works about the same on sore muscles. Did not do as advertised. I would not waste another dime on this product. I have tried other products that actually work, so I know the difference. Do yourself a favor, buy something else. Only good thing about this product is no one knows your using it due to lack of menthol smell."
5,"""Para que nunca mas""","I am fortunate enough to know some of the people who gave testimony here. This important book makes us face the experiences and effects of exile. Anyone who wants to understand Chile and its people should read this book. At the memorial to the disappeared and politically executed in Santiago's General Cementary, there is a stone with the message ""Para que nunca mas,"" which orders us to never let such suffering happen again. As one of the contributors told me, we must know his experience so that we will not repeat this tragic part of Chile's history."
3,Yay - I guess,I was entertained for 2 hours - but then it ended. I found it rather boring as I sat there waiting for a chance to be apart of the action. It was frustrating to try to make your character do what you wanted him to do.
3,Good Episode: Bad Game,"Star Trek: Borg, like Klingon, doesn't really do much. You are a new Cadet who is assigned to a ship that is about to investigate the Borg. With the help of Q, you get to learn about your father and his battle with the Borg. All of this is very interesting, but there isn't much for you to do. Like the early game Dragons Lair, you just have to deside when to shoot, when to go left, when to go up, etc. If you like Trek, this is an interesting collectors item. Otherwise, it would be wise to skip this game."
3,Not really a toy...,...for rough play. The wheels broke the first time my four year old dropped it. The other parts seem to be a little more durable though. Maybe you should just leave the wheels off! But my boy still loves it and we had a fun half an hour putting it together.
2,Not what I expected,"My son is seven, and this was a challenge for him. In fact, his grandfather did most of it for him. The pieces did not fit together easily and the screws were small. Nice to look at now that it is done, but would not buy again. Too much money for the little we got out of it."
2,order up!,"These shoes are gorgeous and well-made. But definitely order up. The EU39 - which supposedly translated to a US9 - was extraordinarily tight and narrow around the heel and toebox. Granted, my feet are more ""US-sized"" than European, but still recommend going up a size if you're looking for comfort. Pretty high heel; almost too much for me."
2,Bad quality,"The quality of the picture was poor. It was very fuzzy, and at times shadowy. The actual show itself is a great show. Can't wait for the next episode."
4,FUN show,I love white collar but your streaming is not so great. it stops and starts A LOT. I work on my patience when it is time to watch
4,"Great, Witty Crime Show","This is a typical USA production of a crime show, a lot of colorful characters, great production values and interesting and quirky stories.Start from Season 1 and work your way up to Season 4."
5,I'm hooked & this was easy,"Got hooked on White Collar & found the only places to view the most recent past season was Amazon or iTunes. Amazon pricing was better, streaming came through without any hitches or glitches. It was all very easy. I've used streaming video before, but this was my first time trying Amazon. It worked great!"
5,good show,good show!!! really enjoyed the story lines and the drama. would like to see more shows like this one. have any suggestions?
5,Awesome Show! Must See 5*,"Great show, great acting, great plots, twists and turns. Keep the episodes coming! 5*+ Rating! AWESOME, Debonaire Cary Grant style!"
5,White Collar,"My husband and I are quite addicted to this series. We just finished season 3 on Netflix and put down our hard earned dollars to buy season four. The series is still going strong though the writers seem to wrestle more with what to come up with now. Often series get weaker as the seasons go on, but so far White Collar is going pretty strong."
2,Didn't get what I paid for.,"In my first effort to purchase, I was angered by the fact that I purchased the entire 10 episodes and only received 9 of them. Not sure I would do this again."
5,Great show!,"I started watching White Collar a couple months ago and now I'm hooked! Great story line, great writing, I can't wait to watch the next episode!"
4,Very good,"I like this series very much. It is smart and fun. The writers seem to be struggling more in this season, but still very good!"
5,Character-driven and non-formulaic,"The only bad thing about this show is its title. My brother insisted I watch it, and once I did, I was hooked. The acting across the board is strong, and for the most part, the characters deepen season-by-season. The interplay between (perhaps) ex-con Neal Caffrey with FBI man Peter Burke keeps deepening, and somehow the writers produce situations that the audience may have thought it wanted but, once confronted with the ""fact,"" finds instead that the ""reality"" is very different. Worth every cent to watch it."
5,Outstanding Cant Wait for Season 5,Never a dull moment. The writing of this series is brilliant. Epsidode 1 and 2 are my favorites. We need more series like this
5,Fun,"A fun and entertaining show to watch. Although it has its serious tones here and there, overall its a lightly toned show with humor and a bit of mystery as to how things will turn out."
5,You just don't know what they're going to do next...,"This is the kind of show I would recommend to my friends. It has its twists and turns, and keeps you watching...It doesn't have a boring episode in my opinion and the cast is really good!It starts off with him on an island and his best friend/partner from White Collar trying to track him down before others can..If you havent seen season 1 and you are just starting here I recommend watching the first episode of Season 4 and then immediately go to Season 1 to catch up. You won't be let down."
5,Best Show Ever!,"White Collar is my kind of show. As a near seventy woman, I don't have time to watch scary, depressing or stupid shows. White Collar has very little violence, no profanity or anything else that offends me. I love the characters- all of them. The relationship between Peter and Neil is extraordinary. The writers are to be commended by bringing humanity and soul to all the characters, even Mozzie. Of course, some of the events and solutions to their problems are quite unrealistic and unbelievable. I can see that, but I just dismiss it and enjoy the ride. I have watched every show and look forward to many more. Buying episodes from Amazon is a treat to myself!"
5,Great Great show!!,"Love all the ""White collar"" episodes! The actors and actresses are great together and the suspense is riveting. The only bad thing is that you get ""addicted!"""
3,Sub par episode,"I'm glad this isn't the first episode of White Collar I watched, as is could also have been the last, and I really like this show. This time, the plot seemed sloppy. Peter and Neal were obviously out of their element boxing. Sure, they both look good with their shirts off, but not so good that it makes up for a poorly scripted episode."
5,White Collar,"I think Matt Bomer is an excellent actor, as I consider all on the show. The emotion he shows with his eyes and face is what makes the show, as is the caring interaction between the main characters. We see Neal Caffrey's character growing(with a little relapse now and then) in every episode. Needless to say, I love this show and hope it continues for many more seasons."
5,TV's Best Bromance!,"This bromance seems to be back in full swing in Season 4! The show has just the right balance of action, mystery, humor, and bittersweet moments. I hope it continues another 10 seasons!"
1,One of my least favorite episodes of the season,"The show started out so good, but this episode was pretty low. I hope it picks up soon I don't like the tension between Neal and Peter. Geez they're has to be a little trust between those two."
5,It continues.,Such a great show. I cant wait till it returns on the 22nd! I want to know what will happen with the story line!
3,A bit pricey,"This is a fantastic show, but it's a bit pricey for a partial season. I don't know how often I'll want to purchase shows here vs just waiting for them to hit netflix. Disappointed with the variety of material offered through Prime, as well. More things like this should be included."
3,nothing special,"I was hoping for more. It is ok if you are sick, and have a day to lounge in bed, not high action or drama."
2,not worth the purchase price,"If you're paying to catch up on the series might want to go to the next one, this is just filler no substance, and I think the next program will show you sufficiently what happened here in their one minute intro"
5,White Collar Seasons 1-4,"We all love it and can't wait for season 5. Thought provoking, intelligent series that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat."
5,Amazing Show,"The dynamics in this show are quite amazing. They keep you guessing. Just when you think you know what is going to happen or you think you've got it all figured out something else pops up and you are completely baffled, bit in a good way."
5,one of my favortie shows,my sister told me about this show. she told me that i would love it and i do. its witty and give a fresh new take on the normal criminal show.
5,"Intriguing characters, engaging plot","Well done, addictive series. Fast paced drama that has a plot line that wraps up with each episode plus a running plot line that continues throughout the season (and season to season). Recommended."
2,I don't know why I keep watching,"I hate myself, but whenever I get sick, I watch this show. It's really very bad, and there isn't too much that makes it good. The characters are well dressed, but I don't know what makes me keep watching it. The episodes are clones of each other, and if it weren't for the incredibly attractive people, I think that I would have never made it past Season 1. When I watch this show, it just makes me hate myself and wish I were in better shape."
5,:),"Love this show! I cant wait to see more. I got hooked on it when netflix had it in my must see list based on other shows I am interested in, I took a shot and Im glad to have something to watch again. So many shows now are the same thing different characters, with this show you really dont know whats going to happen next!"
2,Jumped the shark,"I've always enjoyed White Collar, as silly as it is, because of its stylish take on NYC. But in the last few episodes, it's lost some of the features that anchor at least my interest. If anyone's paying attention, then:1. We don't need a psychobabble back story for Mozzie2. What happened to the women? Elizabeth is sorely underused; Diana is barely present; Sara is nowhere to be seen. These roles are all played by fine actresses who bring humor, class, and pizzazz to what is otherwise a Hardy Boys story. Bring 'em back! In fact, a few episodes where the boys are locked up somewhere and it's up to the girls to rescue them would help a lot.3. Is there a writers' strike on? The actors look embarrassed delivering some of that dialogue."
2,Meh.,I liked the previous seasons much better. The writing in Season 4 seemed to take a nose dive. It became formulaic and predictable.
2,Broke On The Second Use!,"We Bought One Set From Amazon & They Quality Seemed Good For The Price & We Used Them With No Issues & Liked The Fact They Were Metal & Not Plastic. I Wanted To Have Two Of Each Size Clamp, So We Ordered A Second Set. We Don't Use These Everyday But They Are Nice To Have When Needed. We Had a Job That Required The Use Of The Small Ones. I Went To The Tool Box, Grabbed them & Proceeded To Affix It To The Line In Which After I Squeezed It The Jaw Broke Off Cleanly. The Break Appeared To Be From A Casting Defect. I Would Not Buy Anymore & Look For A Different Brand To Buy In The Future"
4,Terrific Manual,"I found this book a terrific supplement to the manual that comes with the Pro version of MS FS2k. (I don't know if a gamer using the standard version would need more info that this book provides.) It picks up where the Pro user's guide left off, by showing you how to fly the planes like a real pilot. The book is a pleasure to read, as flying details are explained clearly. And the price is just right! :)"
2,"Not bad, but there are better choices.","While this book gives an excelent overview of real world flight, there is no coverage of the helicopter, extra, or sailplane. Also, the book describes a lot of stuff that is not in Flight Simulator 2000. If you want to compare real-world flight with the Flight Simulator world, this is a good book. Otherwise, there are better choices."
4,Perfect!,The couple whose baby I bought this for are really into unisex and non-traditional color choices for their first child. Looked everywhere online for an outfit that would strike all the right chords. This was it. They loved it!
5,For Directors by a Director,"Harold Clurman, who has directed many successful plays in his time, shares with the reader some of his wit and wisdom. Clurman breaks down his ""technique"" chapter by chapter to give the reader his thoughts on character analysis, rehearsals, etc. This helpful book is a great read for aspiring directors, like myself, or anyone already working in the field. Clurman's humor is woven through the book through his use of anecdotes and examples.An enjoyable, insightful read."
2,Not practical for 21st century American theatre,"I bought the book because I was so excited by the other reviews. Sorry, but this book which was actually written in 1972 by a British director speaking mainly about his (& his cohorts') British methods (which he notes are different from Americans), in a flamboyant writing style which I couldn't even understand at times...is worthless to me! This, in my opinion, is not practical for 21st Century American theatre. No doubt it was respected in its day, of course...but NOW is no longer ""its day"". The description's publishing date lists it as 1997--referring to the date of this the Fireside publisher edition."
5,Fantastic,"Makes a great cup of coffee or espresso. Works perfectly. Ordering capsules is simple and fast, too."
5,Very coherent indeed,"""Parallel Computing: From theory to sound practice"" can be a very helpful and easy to read too. I find it amazingly helpful for all theoretical and practical purposes and I would recommend scientists and engineers to buy it if they need a desk reference for any time."
4,"Funny Cide: How a Horse, a Trainer, a Jockey, and a Bunch of High School Buddies Took on the Sheiks and Bluebloods...and Won","This is a very easy book to read in a short amount of time, and very entertaining."
5,"Funny Cide, the best gelding of the 21st century",Funny Cide was an exceptional racehorse. The gelding came out of nowhere to win the Kentucky derby! that's worth writing about. His story was closely followed in a way that you cannot see on television or read in the newspapers everything that happened. A great book to read. Funny Cide outstandingly successes Seabiscuit as the underdog that triumphed in the sport of kings.
3,"Good read, but not truly a ""horse story""","Sally Jenkins does a good job of telling the success story of Funnycide's career leading up to the ""big three"", but it's not your typical horse story. If you're loking for the insight on the how's and why's leading up to Funnycide's victory from the horse world's prespective, you will be let down. This reads as a biography of the entire Funnycide team (still a story worth being told). It's a great read for non-horsepeople, but those who are into horses and the world of racing will be disappointed from the perspective it is written from."
2,"If You Know The Story Already, Skip The Book","Funny Cide was a great story, and every racing fan knows it pretty much by heart. Even non-racing fans were caught up in the wonderful story of this basically unwanted gelding's run for the Triple Crown.And unless you really want to know the details of the mundane lives of the ""plain folks"" who formed the syndicate that bought Funny Cide, then there's no need to buy this book. If you know someone who is just getting into thoroughbreds, then share this book with them. Otherwise, this book says nothing new."
2,1 ok 1 Bad One,I ordered 2 of these as extension cables for my PC sound card. (Headset/ Mic)One was fine but the other must have been shorted out and caused a constant hum in the headphone or feedback on the mic.
3,"Decent, but there is better...","While reading this book, I was satisfied with it and learned valuable information. However, once a good friend of mine - who is a criminology professor at Towson University - gave me a copy of Cullen and Agnew's book titled, ""Criminological Theory: Past to Present,"" I quickly became somewhat disappointed with Akers' book. Even though I did aquire valuable information from Akers' book, in comparison I felt the Cullen and Agnew book was much better organized and much more thorough."
3,Textbook,Contains a lot of information about criminological theory. Unfortunately it is written for someone who already knows a lot about the topic. Also the authors prefers to use 25-cent words rather than explain theories in a simple and direct manner. Interesting reading but bring your dictionary along to help understand the language.
1,I am very upset,"I am very upset at the fact that I purchased the criminology book on the 16th of September and my book was mailed on the 23 of September and I needed it for my class home work. Are you serious, I am a very unhappy customer. The book was supposed to be here by the 22nd or 23 the latest according to Amazon."
4,Toner,"The toner works, the shipping was fast, the ordering was convenient. Amazon's price is competitive, I just wish toner wasn't so expensive."
3,"Good, but...","I've always liked The Future Sound of London, particularly the 'Dead Cities' and 'Lifeforms' albums, but I'm not so sure about this. To cut a long story short, there are definitely great songs here with a real psychedelic feel, but on the other hand, there's a bit too much sitar and a couple of terrible songs that simply should have stayed out."
5,Excellent primer,The preface to this book says it is suitable for a college student or an engineer trying to get up to speed with real time systems. An excellent overview.
2,Too cursory except as a text book,"The preface to this book says it is suitable for a college student or an engineer trying to get up to speed with real time systems. The latter is nonsense. It may work for a college course where a skilled instructor is adding material but it is far too cursory to apply. The first 6 chapters are basic material for any curriculum on programming. The chapters that follow mention difficulties but give no techniques that can be applied. Nothing in this would enable a person, previous unprepared to do so, to write a real time system.This book says it eschews mathematical formalism for practical utility. What it lacks is both a formal foundation and practical utility. The exercises (completely without sample answers) are terribly thought out. The description of difficulties of real time job scheduling are a list of known problems and some references to other papers. Sample code included is too specific to be general, and too general to be directly applicable."
4,ESTA ES UNA OPERA MARAVILLOSA,"Si bien le puse 4 estrellas, ello es debido a ciertos personajes que me parecen no muy logrados, o cuya voz no es lo suficientemente buena para ranquearla con 5 estrellas. De todos modos, los duetos cantados por Pilar Lorengar y Wunderlich, son de antología. Están en los tracks 6 del CD 1, y 19 del CD 2. Relamente, la voz de ambos es de una belleza que eriza la piel. Muy, muy buena."
1,Not the movie I thought it would be,"I expected this movie to be the current version of ""Contraband"" and it was an old black and white movie. Wasted my money on this one."
3,So-so early Powell/Pressburger,"Conrad Veidt has those Caligari eyes that have always made him seem so sinister, and together with his thickly accented, nasal voice, they hurt an otherwise fine attempt at being a likeable hero. The movie itself has a British-era Hitchcock feel to it, essentially a light-hearted espionage tale that begins aboard a Danish freighter (helmed by Veidt) confined at a British port for examination during wartime, and then leads by train into London during a blackout. Veidt makes a good staunch captain, but his foray into romance with Valerie Hobson and the general equanimity of his written character don't jibe with his pinched appearance. Not as charming or engaging as it could have been."
4,A Bag for the Road,"The Roadrunner is a sturdy attractive bag. I'm substituting it for a backpack, and it's a great size to hold all the things I need for my hour long work commute on the train. I'm usually carrying lots of extra stuff like shoes, water bottle, lunch, reading material, music, and cell phone. The wide sling type shoulder straps are comfortable and adjustable. The outside zippered compartments work well to keep my small things organized. The only thing that would make this bag better is if it had more inside pockets or compartments. There is only one very small zippered pocket inside."
4,the antediluvian world,"Being a latinamerican reader as well as a student of the 19th egyptian dinasty, I have been delighted with Mr. Donnelly's treatment of the correlations between the native american and egyptian archeologies. This work becomes a magnificent base for the study of the hyperborean 1196 B.C. invasion, a theme of my deepest interest.I am of course interested in the other books in your Atlantis series. I highly recommend this book to the Amazon friends as an excellent historical review.Thanks !"
5,"AT-LAST, ATLANTIS EXPLAINED","This definitive work on the long lost continent of Atlantis is not only a classic of modern thought, but an overwhelming theory on the characteristics, beliefs, and world influence that Atlantis has had. I highly recommend Donnelly's Atlantis to any reader who is interested in social science or a good old Atlantean investigative report."
2,Atlantis: The Antediluvian World,"In general this book is very interesting and informative, but it is a little hard to understand and is very confusing. I had to read pages over and over in order to understand them."
3,Jeeves Collection,"Entertaining, but dated. I bought these books for light reading, and what I got is what I wanted, light reading."
2,Snapshot of bygone era,This is a snapshot of the early 1900s and the relevant topics of the day from the eyes of upper-income society.
5,very entertaining,British humor is so very fresh and entertaining. This book was very hard to put down. It was a real page-turner.
4,The Jeeves Collection,"I love Wodehouse! His writing is hysterical, and Jeeves is one of my favorite characters of all time. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a wry sense of humor and over the top plots."
5,Nice Mechanic Tool Set For The Weekend Warrior,I found the mechanic tool set to work excellent for the auto mechanic projects that I performed ( I am the furthest thing from a professional mechanic ). I probably wouldn't advise a professional mechanic to purchase this set but I'm sure they wouldn't anyway. The tool set is well made and very sturdy. The only gripe I have is that one of the locking tabs on the case broke the first time I closed it so now the case has only one locking tab ( something Stanley may want to fix it the future ). I give it five stars because for the price it's an excellent buy.
5,Works well,I always try to buy name brand for my printer. This worked well for me and would recommend to anyone else. Great price also.
3,Getting People to the Polls Takes Effort,"Surprising conclusions...except, not really.It is good that some of this stuff has worked out, but a lot of it could be articulated by most people who spend time on GOTV. Political contact works better the more it is like a face-to-face conversation about information relevant to the person's life.Hence, door-to-door canvassing is the most effective. Not surprising.Phones come in second. Not surprising.The more conversational and informational the phone call is, the more effective is. Still not surprising.But this book is also a somewhat daunting reminder of just how difficult a good GOTV effort is. Virtually every one of their models pans out to about one additional voter for every hour of voter contact. Boy am I looking forward to next weekend."
4,Invaluable book for campaign workers,"This book is very important for campaign workers for the simple reason that it provides statistical proof of ""common sense"" assumptions about campaigning. Perhaps more importantly, it also demonstrates to first time candidates & campaign workers that some highly-touted gimmicks DON'T work and are a waste of money. It seems to me well worth the price of the book to know how not to waste a campaign's time & money."
4,Finally: Facts instead of guessing,"This small book does not much, but it does, what it claims, and it does it in a scientific manner. After pointing out the importance of voter mobilization, Donald P Green gives an overview of five commonly used ways believed to increase voter turnout: Door-to-Door Canvassing, Leaflets, Direct Mail, Phone Banks and Electronic mail.For the ones used to local campaigns (even outside the us), nothing of this is specifically new. Green however backs his claims about the influence of any of the five ways to increase voter turnout by more or less robust field research results. So he delivers facts (or at least probability...) instead of guessing. This is what makes this small book an outstanding one in comparison to many ""campaign manager manuals"" which commonly end up telling a bunch of anecdotes about past campaigns."
4,Pleased with book,"To my knowledge, this book is unique in that it reports on scientific survey designs which lead to conclusions about the effectiveness of a variety of techniques."
3,"Mom of a race car lover, Cincinnati OH","I bought this for my four yr old son, knowing that I would help him build it. He loves anything that has to do w/ race cars!We built it and it was going together very well, untill we had to screw the wheels on. The screws didn't hold the wheels on, they kept coming off. You'll need to uses longer screws. A couple of the axles were a little warped but still worked. My son plays with this w/o the wheels. It is very nice, it is too bad they don't supply you w/ longer screws."
3,Lots of patience and a strong drill needed,"We gave this to my 4 year old son today for his birthday. He was thrilled and couldn't wait to help dad put it together. Unfortunately that's when the excitement ended. All the screw holes were too small and had to be drilled out and this was quite difficult to put together. No way a child could have done it.Once it was all together though he is having a great time playing with it and it should be durable and fun. If you buy this, make sure to have a drill handy and explain to your child that mom or dad will need to do most of the work in building it. Our son did pretend to use his own plastic drill, but could not even use the screwdriver at all himself since even with drilling, the fit was very tight."
1,COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM THAN DESCRIBED,"I will give the seller a chance to rectify this problem and I am hoping for a call back tomorrow. But so far, I am completely disappointed. I ordered this specific toy race car because of the red and blue colors and because of the number 4 on it!!! My son's birthday is February 16th and wanted to give it to him for his 4th birthday! I received a red/orange car with the number 78!! This is absolutely devastating for me. I am hoping the actual sellers will work this out with me and if they do I will be happy to change my review!"
3,Solid . . .but for a collector,"You're not buying the guitar. . .you're buying the signature. Paul is endorsing Washburn/Lyon guitars because they are cheap and marketable to the masses. The idea is to get kids interested in MUSIC--not video games or drugs, or being couch potatoes. . .and he does this by signing some guitars, and using that fame to sell these cheap guitars.If you want to learn to play the guitar. . .this is a good kit. But there are better kits: the Strat Pak from Fender/Squier is better. But, remember, if you are buying this. . .you are likely a collector.I bought one from e-bay: Number 25 of 7000. Came in with a knob broken. I've decided to rebuild mine with better humbuckers, better electronics, strings, etc. I bought the guitar for the signature. . .not for the guitar.Once mine is rebuilt, I'll frame it, hang it with my other Kiss stuff and NEVER sell it.It is worth every penny they've asked for it."
5,Off the chart,"I would give this 10 stars, if I were able. This book is a classic, and after reading it, you can undestand why Hesse refused the Nobel Prize for Literature. I have loaned and purchased copies of this book since the early 1960s. This latest copy I bought for my oldest grandson. It's a book like The Little Prince, The Rubiyat, This is My Beloved, and some others that I still buy for new friends and family members who do not have a copy. I think it should be in everyone's library. What? You haven't read Siddhartha yet? What's taking you so long?"
1,Drive Size Not Listed,They do not list if this is a 1/4 3/8 1/2 or 3/4 drive set nor do they list if the sockets are sae or metric........
5,Great arrangements!,"I have been playing the violin for a little over 3 years, and will be playing at my first wedding in a couple of weeks. My teacher and I have both been impressed by the quality of the arrangements and the variety of the pieces."
4,Disco bom.,Disco bom. Boas músicas. 'Realmente para quem gosta de rock and roll. Me fez lembrar um pouco do Iron Maiden (guitarras gmeas excelentes). Sou do Brasil e aqui o rock também é muito apreciado. O. G. SINHORI.
4,This is a good book,This book allowed me to have the confidence to write a macro that would produce a resume tailored to the ultimate recipient. The final product was a Word macro that read external text files. It worked marvellously proving that the adage that networking for a job can have the effect of turning friends and acquaintances into enemies.
1,PePe le Pew,"Maybe that is not a fair title, but when you pay a lot of money for a perfume, you hope that it doesn't smell so bad as to offend anyone. But, I must admit that it could be the wrong chemistry for me and may smell like the musk, vanilla that it claims to be for someone else. Thank God for samples."
4,Remakes and Remixes from camp spanish duo,"All disco fanatics should be familiar with the Spanish duo Baccara and their classic camp hits from the 70's notably Yes Sir I can Boogie and Sorry I'm A Lady.This is a 1999 remake cd featuring one half of the original duo and a new partner rerecording and reworking some of their original hits and one or two new recordings thrown in for good measure.Some of it works very well ""The Devil Sent You to Loredo"", Parlez Vous Francais,(sung in French this time and without the funny original English Intro vocals) and Sorry I'm A Lady, whilst their biggest hit Yes Sir I can Boogie while still danceable has had its original bad pronunciation vocals cleaned up so it loses some of its charm.Still its catchy, danceable, listenable and (laughable) Euro disco at its best."
1,Daily Surprises!,"With this calendar, each day you will be surprised by how the beer descriptions leave you with absolutely no idea what Klein was drinking. Was it good, bad, .... was it beer? The writing is awkward, repetitive and formulaic, as if he just switches words between descriptions based upon thesaurus searches. He's also quite fond of using obscure words that ultimately reduce the clarity of his descriptions. Well shoot, here's what fails to disappoint"". ""Hearty, bouyant, and crackling, Domino pilsener is a treat for those who appreciate a delicious pilsener beer"""
5,Central Oregon is Not Just for Seniors and Skiers,"This is a book for people who are worried about traveling or settling in Bend, Oregon, with kids. Fear no more. McCage has collected information about enough child-friendly activities in Bend to keep any family happy. This handsome and appropriately priced small volume has advice on the outdoors, arts and education, entertainment, and annual events, as well as offering tips on kid-approved dining and snacking. It also features black and white photographs of the area as well as cute pictures of her young son Joseph enjoying ice cream and playing in the Sun Mountain Fun Center."
1,This synchronizer doesn't work with Palm TX,"I own a Palm TX pda which synchronizes by USB or Bluetooth. I got this to synchronize by USB to my laptop computer. The original one had a depressable button on the topside of the pda connector cable. This one doesn't. When you set up the Palm Desktop, it walks you through the process until you get a screen saying ""press the synchronization button on the cable."" There isn't one, so I couldn't go any further. The net result is that I now only synchronize to the desktop by BlueTooth and can't synchronize to the laptop at all. The older button style USB cables are on eBay, but only as part of a package of other equipment which I already have."
1,Palm TX Sync/Charger/Data Cable,This item simply didn't work at all. This item is NOT like the item that comes withthe Palm TX.
2,Amazon I hope will send the right item THIS time!,"I would HOPE, I get the ordered item, the past two times I got the wrong one,without a sync button for the USB connection!Amazon said that it was an ordering error, lets get it right this time!"
1,Does not work with Palm TX,"Does not work. Did not recharge my TX, can't test if synching would work, but i doubt it. Computer didn't even recognize it."
1,Not what I was expecting,Very flimsy and certainly not an XL which I ordered. I would pass on this product. Very disappointed in it.
4,Comfy and streachable,"I was worried the pants might feel like sand paper, but they were awesome and feel great while doing the various moves in Yoga."
1,don't buy this pants,"Simply, these pants are heavily overpriced. They're made out of chip synthetic material (and not from natural materials as this company promotes on their official web page). I bought XL size pants and after first delicate washing and drying, they shrunk to a medium size, so I gave them away. 60 dollars for nothing... Especially, if you're 6 feet tall (or above)."
4,Beautiful,"I have this CD on tape. I've always thought that the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis was one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written, and this is a beautiful recording of it. If you're someone who also likes the Vaughn Williams ""London"" Symphony, then I'd give the CD 5 stars."
1,Bad transfer.,Such a good performance to be wasted on such a bad transfer. Had I known how lousy a copy this was I would have saved my money and purchased the Marengo version. The best copy I've seen so far was by Image Entertainment on laserdisc but...
1,Cyrano de Bergerac - Alpha Video DVD -,"This a great motion picture. The source material for this Alpha Video DVD is an old tired 16mm print. Sound is as muddy as the picture. The screen actually ""crawls"" with grain. Contast is bad - no detail or resolution. The experience of Jose Ferrer's Academy Award Winning performance is ruined by the quality of this DVD. I don't know why they would manufacture it - and I know NO ONE should buy it! Someone should find new source material like IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT - their Laser Disc was pristine."
1,Bad dub,"This splendid film was never the best looking movie ever made, being done on a low budget in black and white, but this so-called ""enhanced"" edition is so badly transferred to disc as to be virtually unwatchable."
1,I'm so sad.,"I've waited for a release of this movie for twenty years. "" BUT "", the waiting was invain. My old VCR (worn out) tape may not have as good a picture, but at least ""it has all the words"" !!!! This video skips the most important offencing words. What, is this show rated PG now when it comes to words like ""Barbarian""? ( Before the duel at the theatre of Burgogne ). And further on it skips and goes mute in the most intricate parts of his verbal attacs. I am very sad and will have to keep searching for a complete rendition of this ever so romantic and amazing show."
4,Great except for one flaw,"This is my favorite movie of all time. That being said, it is a very good copy of the movie, except for one flaw. At the beginning of the movie during Monfleurrie's intorduction on the stage, there is a 1/2 second hiccup in audio/video.Other than that, fantastic. 5 stars if not for the flaw."
2,NOT THE BEST TRANSFER,CYRANO IS A GREAT MOVIE. THIS IS NOT A GREAT TRANSFER... IF I COULD I WOULD TRY ANOTHER COMPANY FOR THIS DVD. I WILL NOT BUY FROM ALPHA AGAIN.
1,Wonderful Movie--BAD BAD copy of it! Get the VHS!,"I don't know what this company thought they were doing by putting it onto DVD but they made the sound quality of this amazing film so bad you can't really enjoy Ferrer's incredible delivery of lines! If it wasn't such a hassle, I would have returned it and just stuck with my VHS copy of the film. LOVE the movie--hate the DVD."
5,Stunning,"This is ALWAYS on my cd player. I find myself carrying it to my car, on plane trips, to work. The Nitin Sawhney track Homelands (Joe Claussel Dub) is just mersmerizing with the haunting flute solo. Other great tracks include Nusprit Helsinki's Trying, Thievery Corp's Une Simple Histoire, Indica's Classic Sounds. This CD makes me reminisce, recollect old bitter pills and calms me all at the same time. Music for when you are in motion or just chilling in your own plane of reality."
5,Pure pleasure,"Jenny Agutter was Bobbie in the 1960s television series, and over thirty years later in this made-for-TV version she plays the mother.This is utterly delightful, and I found it a worthy successor to the 1960s series. The acting is excellent, especially that of the children, who very much carry the story. Jenny Agutter is just right as the mother trying desperately hard to cope when the bottom has fallen out of her world. In the smaller roles many fine character actors, including Richard Attenborough and Michael Kitchen, add to the richness of this film.Heartwarming, with an ending that made me sob, even though I knew it was coming. A pure pleasure to watch."
3,"A nice little story, good for the whole family","A good family movie. I found this reminiscent of Anne of Green Gables or the Avonlea TV series. Except this is set in England, not Canada. But along the same time period. (late Victorian or Edwardian) This movie is also more about the children in a family, than the adults, as the Avonlea series was.These children faced hardship, but they did not allow this to break their spirits. They kept hope, and despite their own troubles they had concern for their fellow man.Jemina Rooper played the oldest daughter, a young teenager. Jenny Agutter was the mother. We also saw David Bamber and Sophie Thompson in supporting roles. Several of my favorite BBC actors!I enjoyed this enough that I would now like the see the older mini series based on the same story."
3,The Railway Children (DVD),A real old fashioned story where right triumphs over adversity with kindness & caringMasterpiece Theatre: Railway Children
4,Strong effort in remaking a classic,"This is a valiant effort to remake the 1970 film based on Edith Nesbit's novel. In comparing the two, the new version features more ""emoting""; things which went unsaid but were implied in 1970 are now told to us rather than shown. This is to the detriment of the newer version.In spite of this, it is still a beautifully presented tale appropriate for the entire family; I think the production team was quite brave to even attempt a remake."
4,A Railway Classic,"This 2000 Drama classic was shown on our local PBS station under the Masterpiece Theatre title. After viewing this movie, once again Masterpiece Theatre has done itself proud giving us a thoroughly enjoyable and quaint look into the past. The actors and actresses were well chosen and performed well in telling us the story of three young children and their mother taken from rich to poor for a temporary, but unexpected time during the absense of their father/husband. I enjoyed this film very much. The story was simple and easy going, no huge, tramatic drama, but rather with less complex problems of earlier years in history. I find this type of film much more enjoyable today, in a much harder, cold world where we live surrounded by far to much devastation and tragedy. We all could use more films portraying elegance, manners and gentility. A very relaxing film and great stress reliever. END"
5,Excellent overview of Gorecki's work,"This book is an excellent guide to the complete oeuvre of Henryk Gorecki. It covers Gorecki's earliest compositions, his work during his radical phase, and his return to tonality. For those interested in the life and work of this composer, this book is an excellent introduction. Some musical background will be helpful, though."
1,Horribly biased,"Barnes spend the entirety of the book resorting to scare tactics and ""truthiness"" about the actual way diseases came about, how they will continue to kill us and inevitably bring about the extinction of mankind. She blames the advances of civilization for every disease known to man. She cleverly mixes cited facts and her own assumptions to make the reader think that she's presenting unbiased truth. It is clear that Barnes would prefer for humanity to fall back into a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and reduce the human population to a few roving bands scattered around the world."
3,Next to thousand,This is an eminent collection of information about many diseases mainly infectious ones and its written history. Unfortunately the information presented is far off the Human evolution.
4,Great Resource,"I'm a fourth grade teacher with only two years of experience. I found the book to be very helpful, especially the interview/observations. I was a little frustrated at the small class sizes in the model teacher's rooms, but the ideas and information were excellent. Be warned that the editing was done poorly. I would recommend it to 3rd through 5th grade teachers."
2,"""Good Guys"" make for bad Biographies.","As a baseball fanatic, why wouldn't I read about one of the greatest pitchers of all time? I think the book would have been a lot better if Big Matty wasn't such a boring guy.I was hoping for some sort of foul play, foul language but there was nothing. A lot of "" boy, that Mathewson sure was a heck of a guy"" and ""I wish we were all like Christy"" If you want to read a boring book with little to no excitement, pick this one up. However, if you want excitement and emotion, head towards Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Satchel Paige or Hal Chase."
2,Mathewson-Lite,"There is not enough baseball detail in what could have been an interesting book. Seib's efforts to set the career of BIG SIX in a broader context is laudable, but misses the point for a book this brief and this short. Some people devote their lives to the history of the world's greatest game. Seib is not one of them. The mechanics of his prose will not put you to sleep, but do not linger in the mind either. But the glaring error of this book is selling Christy short. Seib can bring himself to devote less than two pages to one of the greatest World Series performances in history, where Christy spun three shutouts. While some baseball books devolve into pitch-by-pitch tedium, more detail here is demanded.If there is a better Christy book out there I will consider reading it. Do not waste your time with this one."
3,A Baseball Bio -More or Less,"The Player is an enjoyable, quick read with several charming stories about Mathewson and his time. However, there is surprisingly little detail about games and achievements and the year to year growth of Mathewson into a great player. Seib does mention the year he pitched 3 shutouts in the World Series and a few other astounding achievements, his incredible accuracy, his college years, his relationship with McGraw and others. It is also nice to see all this put in the context of the time but too often the context is often close to irrelevant in its detail and Mathewson gets lost in the mix. One also expects a summary of stats but none is included--a baseball fan expects that much on the back of a baseball card. Surely a page of the book could have been devoted to it."
1,I think this is copyright infringement,"I'm pretty sure this is illegal. The watchtower bible and tract society of new york owns the rights to this book, and gives them away for free. You're probably going to get sued."
1,I sold my soul to satan,What I expected to be a scary movie turned out to be a bunch of losers too lazy to do the work to achieve what they want. Instead they were making bargains with an entity. This was reality T.V. gone bad. Lizard Lick Towing is more interesting than these guys. Bad! Really bad!
5,Slow acting fuses,This was a great purchase. Have a portable air compressor that plugs into a cigerette lighter. The fuse blew in the plug and could not find the unusually small size in any store or auto parts store. This outlet had the correct size. Saved me from having to buy a new compressor. Fuse worked great.
3,"""Awesome stuff from a great racer""","I'm glad I checked these tapes out and listened to them. If I would have started reading the book, I doubt I would have finished it. What a great rags-to-riches story. Bobby Unser has lived quite a life. There is so much a person can learn about success by listening or reading about his adventures on, and off the track. My only complaint is that many, if not most of the stories were repeated many times. Other than that I highly recommend these tapes. I enjoyed them."
3,It was fun,"It was fun to play a Klingon and feel the honor and glory of the culture. I never thought that they had so much going for them. The adventure itself was wierd, and not much happened, but it might have been a good episode."
2,What a terrible game!,"I'm a big fan of the series, but anyone who has not played this, don't even bother spending your money. I bought this game today, and have already finished it! Where is the excitement? There are no battles, no fights, and really no fun. What's next? Star Trek Romulan? I hope not. I should have learned my lesson after reading ""Kahless"" in the ""Star Trek"" book series. That was also bad. Let these two things be a lesson."
4,Nice product.,"This was my first experience through Amazon.com, it was good, They delivered the product on time. I recommend it. Thank you very much."
3,Didn't quite catch my attention......,"I didn't really enjoy this adaption. O'Connor just didn't fit the bill to play Emma. I never got any sense of passion or tension in her, she played it too flat. And a little over the top in some places. But never right on. It was only ok, nothing miraculous.The whole movie just felt ""wrong"". I won't be watching it again."
1,Didn't Like,"I'm sure that Ms. O'Connor is a good actress, but this movie wasn't good. I wasn't empathetic toward Madame Bovary at all. Dr. Bovary may have been a conservative man, but he didn't come off as cruel or otherwise deserving of a cheating wife.The story cut off suddenly and was otherwise tedious. I am sure that the actual novel was much better, but there was no emotion in the movie. Waste of time."
3,Where's the US version DVD?,"I saw this mini-series on tv and LOVED it!!! Emma is just SOOOO flawed in that she's constantly looking for romantic fullfillment outside of her marriage since her husband, although well meaning, is clueless about his wife's desires and needs (not to mention her extra curricular activities!). I only give this review 3 starts instead of 5 because I am utterly dissappointed that there is no US version DVD! HELLO???? What about those of us on the other side of the pond? We're not all illiterate and some of us do actually read classics like this and would like to have it for our collections!!"
3,Better don't know the original Black and White version,"I was very dissapointed. They really made this a cheap and boring version. Anybody who likes dramas like this should watch the 1949 black and white version directed by Vincente Minnellie....and then imagine it in color....Very sad, because I had great hopes for this movie!"
5,Simply Superb customer service,"I couldnt have asked for more. I had a tough schedule ( I was leaving US next week), and upon my request the order was shipped within no time.Thanks for the speedy and wonderful service. The customer care reps were just great.Cheers"
3,Lingo TR-800A Global 8 Language Translator,"I guess you get what you pay for and this item only cost me around $35. I didn't really need one of those translators with hundreds of languages, so the fact that this one only had 8 was fine with me. The problem is the tranlations from English into Chinese. It does give me some (not as many as I'd wanted) but the biggest problem is it doesn't give the tone mark. So I'm not sure how to pronounce it in Chinese and the tone makes a BIG difference in the meaning! So, it's not that useful for me, other than, I could get an English word displayed in Pinyin and ask a Chinese person how it's pronounced. That wasn't what I wanted, but I waited too long to return it while I was in the States and now am back in China. Oh well. Maybe I'll take a trip to Italy from here and then it'll be useful!"
3,Not Pleased,SOme of the translation words are wrong....I happen to know them. Japanese trans are pretty bad! It is very limited phrases. If the phrase you are looking for is not on the list then you will not be able to translate it.. You cannot type any phrases you want. It cannot translate that way.
2,Does not contain enough words,"I haven't used it while traveling yet. I am only interested in Spanish. I have a copy of ""The Cat In The Hat"" in Spanish. As a test I tried to translate it into English. If I didn't already know some Spanish it wouldn't have done me much good. It doesn't seem to do well with verbs and idioms.It was not expensive so I guess I got my money's worth."
1,i purchased on 5/5/2009 and....,i purchased on 5/5/2009 and it's now 6/11/09 and i have not got my order yet
4,The Cart was put before the horse,"Rene Descartes can go to a circle in hades for his mathmatics but his discourse on religion was flawed he had to first prove to himself he existed before he could prove God existed, there is the rub. He is justly regarded as the Father of Modern Philosophy because of the questions and problems he created. He helped to distinquish philosophy from science, which is a saving grace. This is a great addition to any library, since it serves to illustrate the evolution of philosophy in our civilization. I would also recommend Deism In American Thought by Woodbridge Riley and of course the Age of Reason by Thomas Paine."
2,"Good methods, okay read","Descartes' Enlightenment exploration of himself and the world in which he lives is easy to understand because his methods are easy to understand. This book is extremely repetitive and, by the time I finished reading it, I was surprised he spent all that time talking just to make a few points. I wasn't, however, blown away by his logic. It was simply an ""okay"" read and possibly even better for the time in which it was written."
2,It's not as good as they are now,"This seems like one of the first Dilbert books ever written, and as so, I don't think it's a very good read compared to the other currently available Dilbert books. This one uses much bigger frames for one; 4 frames per page, making the approximately 4 times bigger than the regular comic strips. This makes it seem like I'm a child reading a children's book, I must say; but this isn't the point.My point is that there are newer and better Dilbert books available right now, and you should read those ones that are also more relevant to today's business world, than this outdated one (even though not that outdated, as I said before and will say again, there are newer ones that you should rather turn your eyes to.)"
1,BEWARE!,"Adams must have been in a very brainless mood when the editors pushed him to do this book (OK, I am aware that $$ talks). I have read other Dilbert books and, believe me, this one isn't worth it. The best clue I can give: spend the money's worth of this book on someone whom you care about. You won't regret it."
3,"Extra, unexpected cost","I have already submitted a question to the seller, asking why there was an extra 12.70 Euros to pay to the postman on receipt of the package. So far, the seller has not replied. Therefore I am unable to rate the purchase properly until I get this answer."
5,Have Loved This Album For Years!!!,"We have had this album for 10 years. We first got it as a cassette, and have listened to it every year without tiring. The children's voices are beautiful, and the album is very professionally done. You won't be disappointed!"
2,not highly recommended product,"this is the one I am quite disappointed about. it came 3 days later than onther products I ordered from amazon.com; the condition of the cover was broken when it arrived ; and the songs are not what I expected, it is a bit out of date. I don't recommend others purchase it again."
5,Great Book,This book has a great method of brass instruction and has been an invaluable help in my trumpet playing ability.
3,Avoid this and get the Pearl,"If EMI's CD transfer is anything like what they did on LP, this set will be a travesty. I remember the amazing colors that the Victor LPs of this set had, in contrast to the Angel Great Recordings of the Century pressing. The Pearl set costs more than twice the EMI, but the sound is truly fresh and full, very much like a mint set of 78's would sound. Schnabel's Beethoven belongs in every collection as the definitive statement, but in a version in which all of its glories are revealed. The EMI won't do, get the Pearl."
1,the ecstasy and the agony,Beethoven 10/10Schnabel 10/10EMI's transfers of these legendary recordings 0/10 - worthless rubbish - my deaf cat could do a better job.Go for the Naxos - they know what they are doing...Unfortunately I am unable to give this no stars - how much it is deserved!
2,The first 100 pages: Gummed up Machine,"I have so many books to read that I have a strict 100 page limit: if it doesn't grab me by then I move on. This book would have been stronger if it had cut the first 55 pages and started at chapter 3. I really didn't get the first three prologues and the first 2 chapters to me didn't progress the story along for me to stick around. I really didn't care how Sharkey got to Vice; that he was there was enough. If the writer felt the necessity to let us know, he could have worked it in when he showed up at Vice instead of having a long, drawn out narritive. So just 2 stars from me."
4,Back to the club house.,"The sound suffers here because of the live environment. On the other hand, you can reproduce the ""club"" environment with surroundsound in your livingroom. If you don't care for Li'l Darling (as one reviewer below), then you just don't like the slow-easy-with-space approach of the Basie-Hefti alliance. Compare with Juggernaut: In a Hefti Bag."
3,A so so album.,"I was somewhat disappointed by this album. This is my 2nd Basie album while the 1st one I purchsed is ""AIN'T MISBEHAVIN"" which is FAR better!First the good news: The musicianship of this band is second to none and live performances are tough and exhausting.Why was I disappointed? The songs, especially the ones by HEFTI, are mediocre. Neil Hefti was an important arranger for Basie but not a good songwriter.The sound on this CD is not good either. You can almost not hear Freddie Green and the horns could be balanced better and the recording just sounds dry - no reverb, no echo - nothing.I'm gonna check out the VERVE releases and maybe some later live recordings of Basie..hope they'll be better."
1,Overstated and Disappointing,"From the description of the book and your 2 reviews on it,I ordered the book. I am going into the cleaning business myself and needed tips on just that. Instead I got tips on how to be a janitor. Not what I wanted. Paid extra for 2 day shipping. Highly disappointed."
4,Great foundation for learning financial planning,"Tools & Techniques for Financial Planners was the first book I read in my financial planning course in preparation for taking the Certified Financial Planner's exam. As someone new to the field, I was excited to read this book.The tools and techniques books have been very helpful to me in getting a firm foundation of their respective financial planning topics. I have been using them to study for the CFP exam. I also will be keeping them in my office for future reference materials. They are well written, well organized, and easy to read. I have the entire set. In the future, I would likely buy the online subscription to the books in order to have the most up to date editions."
4,Full of information but dense,"I received this book in the high hopes of having everything explained to me in clear English. For the most part, my expectations were met. The downside is that the reading is quite dense in most parts. In addition, being a Tax Professional, I found a few, minor errors in the Tax Planning section. Otherwise, the book has been a tremendous help in my studies to become a CFP(R)."
4,CFP Course 1,"Good book to form the foundation for the CFP training and exam. It's too expensive, however. My guess is that it is priced assuming most students get reimbursed by their employers. For those of us who have to pay for the book out of our own pockets, it is too expensive."
2,Why make it more difficult,"I find this book to be incredibly frustrating. If it were not required for the CFP class I was taking, I would find a new book and burn this one. In addition to being horribly written, the book is filled with bad information and old tax rules. I have been in the financial advice industry for over 18 years and even I am confused by the way this book communicates what could be easy to understand concepts. There are times when I have had to read a single paragraph 3 or more times to attempt to understand what is being said. I find that ridiculous! After discussions with others in my class, everyone seems to be having similar frustrations. This content is really not that difficult at all, however, this book is creating difficulty and confusion where there does not need to be."
3,Unsatisfactory,This package lack's two main features. It does not contain any help files and it does not compile. If I knew that it didn't contain help I would have never bought it. The package includes a basic introductory book which is not bad. Another book is included on the cd rom( this book is actually a more substantial one).If you have windows Xp I would strongly recommend to buy the vb.net standard.
3,"OK for starting, but missing some features","I was disappointed that the descriptions and reviews of this product did not point out that the software cannot compile (a feature of VB) and is missing some other features so that an upgrade to VB is necessary to gain all features use. Otherwise, the book and software are good to get down VB basics."
5,Highly Recommended,"Many conservative Protestants (as witnessed in one of the comments here) confuse their reading of the Bible with the Bible itself. For such folks, the notion of ""biblical Mormonism"" is no more intelligible than the idea of a square circle. This book is a direct challenge to such dogmatism. I will simply note in passing that, contrary to one reader who has left his thoughts behind here, neither Latter-day Saints in general nor Richard Hopkins in particular deny the deity of Christ. Nor do they exalt Satan to equality with him. Nor do they deny the concept of divine grace. They view such things somewhat differently from Protestant fundamentalism or evangelicalism, but that is all. A little precision here would help a great deal. Inflammatory distortions serve nobody, in the long run, though they may score a few cheap points in the tactical short term."
1,GS Wholesale Rating Manipulation,"It is a very disingenuous practice to write a 5 star ""customer review"" of a product that you are a seller of. Even if it is under the guise of ""Additional Product Info!"", it is still manipulating the rating system at Amazon, since customers sort searches with average customer rating and your products come out on top. Because of your lack of integrity as a seller, I will never buy a GS Wholesale product. I am also going to complain to Amazon about your rating manipulation."
3,"Good, but a bit cliche.","Okay, this cd was a must buy for me, because I'm an electroclash junkie. It's a decent collection, but it has some no-namers and some over played tunes. Felix da Housecat is awesome, but who wants to hear Madame Hollywood AGAIN? Also, it has Soft Cell, which was a good addition I think. Some good remixes of Information Society and Gary Numan, but overall a mediocre compilation. The 3rd cd is a mix cd of tracks from the other 2 cds. But...it's on Clepoatra Records. Alot of their other compilations end up being ""indusrial"" or industrial-dance trash. This is their best set, but not the best in the genre. I only reccomend this to hardcore fans or beginners not wanting to waste their money."
4,Electroclash - did you miss the point???,"this is a great electroclash albuma lot of reviews have missed the point hereelectroclash is a melting pot of tech , electro , acid house , funked up stuff a clash of stlyes two fingers up to ""standardised "" and pigeon holed musicthis is greatPassion is the new loud !!!!!!"
3,Not entirely 'electro',"While all of the tracks on this comp could be called electronic, some of them do not, in my opinion, qualify as ""electro"" in the sense implied by the title. If you're looking strictly for the quintessence of electro - filthy analog lines, crisp 808 beats, and of course vocoders - you might want to consider another compilation. But if you prefer a hodgepodge of electro and synthpop, this isn't a bad choice."
5,Moog lower ball joints,"Made by Federal Mougal, a respected name in car parts. Item made in Mexico rather than China and seems to be of excellent quality. Came with all necessary hardware for installation.This part was for a Nissan 720 pickup and the the local car parts store could not get the one for the drivers side. The Moog brand is drilled so it fits either side."
5,TOTALLY ENGROSSING !,"I had all but given up on reading, due to my exquisitely perfectionistic outlook on ""What is a good book?"".Thanks to Linda Lay Shuler's ""She Who Remembers"", I am, once more, on that neverending quest for one more morsel of ""pure and exalting literary quisine"".Not only was this book virtually impossible to put down, it transported me so smoothly into a world of it's own, that I found the journey back to my world to be one of the saddest I've ever made.I look forward to all sequels to this ""Native American Tour of Triumph"",in the further adventures of Kwani.Linda Lay Shuler has reserved a seat for me in her stadium of enthusiasts, and I will ever remain there,as ""She Who Will Never Forget"""
1,Completely trashy,"I bought this book because the cover looked good and I thought it was going to be a realistic story about the Anasazi Indians. What a complete disappointment! It started out ok, although the remote and supposedly sparsely-populated woods around where this tribe lived was like Grand Central Station, with everybody running into each other all the time. I could overlook that. But when she ended up in this other village and everybody started doing this ceremony where they got naked and ""gave birth"" to her and a rival woman urinated on her so she bit the woman's breast and then they got into a knock-down drag-out, I had had enough! What a complete insult to the Anasazi, and what an insult to the reader! I must admit I don't know what happened after that, I was disgusted and didn't read the rest."
5,Great Book,Great Book! Love it and have read it over and over. Lost my copy to someone who didnt return it...had to buy another lol.
3,She who remembers,"the book arrived in great condition and what a fantastic story, i couldn't put it down, and i highly recommend it!!. Kay"
4,It's Indiana Jonesesque with a female protagonist.,"Our neighborhood bar offers a free book exchange. We took it because of the comment by Jane Auel.(My husband loved her books.) I think ""She Who Remembers"" is a better story than the Clan books. The action takes place in 13th century America and creates a tale about the elusive Anasazi's. The story blends archeological data and Ameriand legend. It is action packed and a quick read. It hardly stops for a breath. I would reccommend it to any reader who enjoyed ""Mists of Avalon."
5,This book is the best in Southwestern Indian fiction!,"Mrs. Shuler is in a class by herself, she is the only author that I know of that received a nod from Mrs. Auel. This book is beautiful, filled with very colorfull characters and a gripping plot and the most wonderfull backdrop, the American Southwest.(I have been out there and it is as Mrs. Shuler writes it, the sky does go on forever!)"
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read!!!!!!,"I absolutely LOVED this book! It kept me so interested I didn't do homework for about a week! :-) I just finished reading the two sequels, and I still can't get my mind off of it. The book was compassionate, reveals a perspective of life often overlooked, and provides helpful insight as to the real nature of human beings. Although these people lived long ago, they are people, just like you and me, with the same wants and desires. I highly recommend this book to all, and I really look forward to reading more of Mrs. Shuler's novels. (P.S. Are these three books part of a quartet? or is this the last book of the series? And if it is the last book, will Mrs. Shuler be writing more? Please say YES!!!!) Thanks Linda Lay Shuler for writing the best book of all-time."
2,NOT Auel's Earth's Children,"I purchased this book due to numerous favorable comparisons of this series to Auel's Earth's Children series among the reviews - plus the favorable recommendation given to the book by Ms. Auel, herself. But this is not in the same league of Clan of the Cave Bear, or, even, Valley of the Horses. She Who Remembers lacks in the opulent detail of Auel's work - the fauna, flora, survival strategies including hunting, gathering and tool making, etc. This is a garden-variety adventure. The romances of Kwani, the protagonist, are shallow. The setting does not envelope the reader, transporting you back to a different place and time. Both the Earth's Children series and ""She Who Remembers"" are about extrordinary women who are set-apart from their own people and going on a journey of discovery. But there the similarities end. Auel's work soars, while Shuler's falls flat."
2,simplistic and slow,"While vacationing in Sedona, Az I went to find an historical fiction to connect me to the ancient inhabitants I was learning about in this incredible area.This book is not the connection I'd hoped for. While the physical environs were well researched and covered in her book, for me Shuler's character's were unbelievable and simplistic. The story was not interesting and I found myself easily distracted while reading. I finished it mostly because I was on vacation with few other options.Based on the many great reviews here, I ordered all 3 books in this trilogy but now have no real interest in picking up the other 2."
4,Kwani the blue eyed one,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book and the other 2 in the series. I am a fan of the clan of the cavebear series, and found this to be along similiar lines. This story has many different elements to it; theres romance, mystery, violence, suspense and so much more...... Give this book a try, if you like historical books you'll love it"
5,good start to listen to,"I am new to this kind of music and it's a good start to listen to this one.I usually listen to metal music but when I hear this album, my ears accept the tune :)I guess ""Meta"" and ""Storm"" are good introductions to Assemblage if You want to hear the band.I'm going to have all the releases of this band soon."
5,Tom You Peaked It All The Way!,I knew this day would come. Tom outdoes himself each release and this one is the pinnacle. The production value and melodies are phenomenal. The playful abandon with his vocals blew me out of the water! The lyrics are his best yet!! Don't wait buy this one immediately...it requires your ear this instant!Start to finish...genious.
4,Incredibly Inspirational,"As an artist, I find inspiration in music that doesn't take the average path, so to speak. Absolutely anything by A23 has never been a let down, and Meta is no different. Although I prefer previous works a little more (they were just a bit more fast paced), I would happily advise anyone to purchase Meta."
5,The Best One Yet,I have been watching A23 for years. This is the best album so far. It just keeps getting better and better.
2,Meh.,"I opened these and was a bit disappointed in them. There is a seem running down both sides of them, which makes them look really cheap. Washing them a few times, they have slight discoloration, and 2 of them have broken easily. Also, they are very very slippery. My husband and I are pro with chopsticks - having lived in Japan for 2 years, but these ones are difficult for both of us to use. I wouldnt recommend :( The only good thing about this is that the little holders are nice. And before the colors fade from washing, theyre very cute."
4,Great reel,"Good rugged fairly large reel, made in USA. I use mine for halibut and tuna. Always works with no problems, and being a Penn you can always get repair parts and they are easy to clean and repair. Not as nice as Penn Internations, but nmowhere near the price either. I have owned mine for a year or two and no problems."
1,Not Like They Used To Be,"I have been buying these pans about every 2 years. They were commercial weight, had very good non-stick properties and were relatively inexpensive. I was very disappointed with my recent purchase. The weight is less than 1/2 of the previous pan, the handle transmits heat rapidly (caution - you will want to put a silicone grip on it), and it is clearly of much lower quality. Already looking for a replacement."
2,very poor transfer,"I guess the story here is pretty fair: A teacher at a boy's boarding school is someone other than who he appears to be, and when someone finds out, he must protect himself using any means possible, including murder.The DVD though, seems to be the real horror here. There are missing bits, dialog and action jumps, and obviously some scenes have been cut, and not particularly well. Televista/Substance/etc. quality runs from ""not bad"" to ""really bad"" and this one, unfortunately, falls into the latter category. There are times when it looks quite good & then action & dialog jump ahead with missing words and actions that are very frustrating. Not recommended...I would like to see this film with a proper transfer, though. 2 out of 10."
2,Cash muddied by overproduction,"Cash's post-sun, pre-american recordings career has truckloads of great cuts, but too often, especially with 80s-early 90s recordings his voice is stuck into what feels like a casio keyboard preset. This is my problem with this Christmas CD. Cash's voice is cluttered up by hokey background music and there's way too much female chorus on every song. It's like putting Marlon Brando in the middle of a Kathy Lee christmas special skit. Johnny always gets 5 stars. Rest of the CD: one or none. I wish sun would have let him kick out a Christmas LP with just the Tennessee two playing a sparse background."
4,Cash on Christmas,"I'd like to know what the one reviewer thought he was going to hear when he got this CD. Not ""classic Cash""? I think it's very much classic Cash... just doing Christmas songs. The words ""Johnny Cash Country Christmas"" on the cover should be a clue to this.For the most part they perform the songs in a 'traditional' style. The only exception is ""Figgy Pudding"", which I actually find to be rather annoying as a screeching woman continues to ask for her snack. On a couple of the songs Cash performs very little or not at all, letting the womens' group take control. Not that that's a bad thing, though.If you love Cash's bass and want a nice, simple Christmas CD this would probably be a good buy for you."
2,A bit too...,"My family and I enjoy Johnny Cash's music throughout his career, and Christmas music is a seasonal pleasure for us, even though we celebrate Yule--it still all works. This album, however, is too far into the realm of sermon-and-Christmas-service to be palatable. Beyond that, the Carter-Cash clan singing backup, or rather, trying to sing, doubtless make this a jewel for their immediate family, but is too ""rough"" and discordant (honestly, these folks can't carry a tune in a dump truck) to be what I'd call ""pleasant Christmas music"" for general listening."
2,About time,"Johnny Cash croaks his way through Weather-Channel arrangements of such little-known Christmas songs as ""Silent Night,"" ""Joy to the World,"" and ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."" It's about time somebody recorded these numbers. Seriously, Cash's singing voice--while barely there--is pleasant as ever, and the arrangements are well-done in an instantly-forgettable sense. Your ears probably won't even notice that they've been there. A few tracks provide a little novelty, including the schmaltzy Johnny Bond-Tex Ritter narrative, ""Here Was a Man,"" which Cash puts across in his usual convincing manner. Only Cash could make such kitsch sound dignified. And there's ""Figgy Pudding,"" which sounds like an outtake from a Doctor Demento Christmas CD--fun, though the silliness would work better for me were it not so obviously planned. Note how the recording was cut right where the cutting-up begins. Slick, pleasant, and seamless, this collection is a worthy addition to any collection of unnecessary CDs."
4,OXO Pancake Turner,"Already owning the original spatula by OXO in this same color I thought this pancake turner would be a nice addition. It's a little hard to maneuver at first b/c of the size difference between this and the original size but once you get used to it, much better. I sometimes have a bit of a hard time sliding the spatula under the food, so I'd say that's a minor downfall. But considering it's size, it's great for taking a whole group of fresh baked cookies or goodies off a baking sheet and works great to transfer pizza too!If you've never used a nylon spatula or you're sick of the residue buildup on silicone spatulas... you have to check out OXO's nylon line. I still like my reguar OXO nylon spatula the best, but this one can definately hold it's own. And the price is pretty impressive."
4,Looking for a CD that's refreshing?,"Once and awhile a disc comes along that is just the whole package: plays easy in the car, and has something to say about real life (note tracks #4, and 10 for example). Tracks 3, 10 echo God's call on our lives; would play well on AC/CHR radio formats. The best compliment is that you won't get tired of listening to it because it has the right mix of light gospel/pop with some serious lyrics that speak directly to you. Produced by Seattlite Scott A. for Refuge Music--A refreshing new face comes to the scene, bringing an encouraging word for you. Get an extra copy to encourage your friend."
2,printer ink.,"You get what you pay for with these inexpensive third-party ink cartridges.Little dabs of ink may run off the cartridge if not careful.(never experienced that with the official canon ink.)Doesn't do well with photographs, but adequate for printing out text."
4,Great Biography,This is an excellent book about the life and times of Sousa. Short-Sweet-To the Point. It has great historical pictures of Sousa along with some cartoon drawings that enhance the story. I will be putting mine in my school's library for the student's to use on their biography project. A great book for an early reader 3rd grade and up.
4,Liked it till the last episode,"If you buy this series don't watch the last episode without knowing there will not be an ending. It was a ""to be continued"" episode and there is no second season."
4,The death of criminal minds suspect behavior!,Why do the networks do this to a show or any other show with the hopes it will gain a audience of interest witch in some cases it does and then pull it off the air just when it looks like it might show potential? This is nothing short of stupidity on the part of the network.They need to realize that it's their audience of viewers that make or break a show and not how deep they can pack their pocket with cash!
3,CM-Suspect Behavior,Ok. I liked the show. I really like the lead actor and admire a lot of his work. However Criminal Minds has been here long enough to establish itself. It has had character moves and yet the ensemble has survived. It doesn't need another show doing the same thing and doing it not nearly as well. There were just way too many comparisons to the original and the original stands alone in my mind...this show doesn't have the weight or the strength that Criminal Minds had coming out of the gate. They broke the mold with the original one and all the rest...at least this one...is just a copy and a fuzzy one at that. Sorry.
1,A woeful season,I have enjoyed immensely the original Criminal Minds but this spinoff was absolutely woeful. What in the world were they thinking to put Forest Whitaker in the lead role?? His character has the personality of a ball of clay in this season. It is hard to believe that he can even act.
2,A mistake that's been rectified,"This show was a disaster from the very beginning. I don't really blame the cast but they were mediocre. The writing was just dreadful. This show felt thrown together over a weekend by middle school kids. Thankfully, it's the only season."
1,This *IS* a crime!,"A coworker, who knew I enjoyed the original series, loaned me this spinoff to view. He didn't comment too much about it at the time, and now I know why. One word describes this package, ""appalling.""At times, it almost seems like this is supposed to be a parody of the original. Garofalo manages to consistently sap anything worthwhile out of any scene she appears in; I don't know who told her she can act, but they lied to her. The scripts are weak, and the direction is inconsistent. If someone hadn't seen the original, they certainly wouldn't want to bother after seeing this mess. There is precious little, here, to recommend spending your cash on, or even sacrificing shelf-space for. Avoid this if at all possible."
3,now i remember why this show didn't last,"I'd forgotten that this show didn't even come close to the original criminal minds. I really had high hopes for this, but pretty disappointing."
4,"Good show, just wish...","It was a good show, alot of twists and turns. I just wish if they were going to take it off they could have given them a final episode."
5,Tale of Annabelle Hedgehog,"My son had to read and complete a book study on The Tale of Annabelle Hedgehog. I checked first with our local library, but they said it might take several days to locate this particular book. When I had not heard from the librarian, I decided to go on amazon to purchase a copy of it. I did, and my son loved the book. I received the amazon purchased book in the mail before the library was able to locate it at another library. I'm sure glad we didn't wait!"
3,great action figure,"It's a great-looking action figure, terrific design. Unfortunately it is hard to find and not worth the obscene amount the scalpers ask for it. Scalping is a terrible parasitic by-product of the collecting marketplace, it's a shame Amazon lets scalpers sell through their site rather than selling the product themselves at a reasonable, retail price. Remember, it's a toy. Fun for the kids, once upon a time..."
4,3 year old grandson knows the names of all the dinosaurs,This is a version of a matching memory game. Our grandkids loved this and beat us playing every time. It is as durable as any card game and larger in size than a standard deck. This is helpful for small hands. I have noticed that they used it a lot and learned a lot at first but don't play it so much any more. That more be because of the phase they are in than the game. I think they will come back to it periodically.
4,Useful! Keeps my wedding pieces together...,"I bought this pretty early on when I was not sure WHAT I would or wouldn't be needing. My first wedding, no wedding planner hired and I ending up liking this. It has thick clear plastic pockets you can put samples of everything in (linens, dress colors, biz cards) and that comes in handy. Helps with some questions you should ask vendors if you don't know the basics (which I did not - so this and the internet)... and give you extra papers for words/ideas.... just half way through planning now and I am still using it. Its a good way to keep ideas, papers, samples, EVERYTHING kept together in a very pretty binder. (Plus if you get stressed and you dont want to think about it for a few days it hides away nicely too...)"
4,Engaged and looking smart,"This book is well-produced and has many helpful lists, folders, images and ideas. I used it as a scrapbook for ideas and inspirations throughout my 6-month wedding planning. Clear pockets help keep ideas and swatches organized. The best part is that when you come to a photographer, baker, florist or any other vendor with this smart-looking notebook/organizer, they know you mean business. Much easier to negotiate when you look well-prepared and professional. I still love flipping through and reminiscing."
1,Only OK,"When I first heard of the idea for this game, i thought it would be interesting. What I didn't relize is there is no ""cross-bredding"" of ships. You can't have a Galaxy Saucer with an Akira body with Defiant Nacelles. Also, they have four presets for each part, and not a way for you to design a totally new saucer. As aforementioned, since there is no cross bredding, you cannot make a new class. And, one of the true low points of the game is, since you are an admiral, not a captian, you just send the ship out and your ""capable"" crew does the rest. No Control, no nothing."
1,Really Really Bad,"This game is BAAAAD. I gave it one star because it is somewhat entertaining building your ship, but after that what do you really do with it? The missions are a joke, they look like a really crappy Flash website."
1,Truth Be Told,"Truth be told, this game is terrible. It might sound interesting to design your own star trek ships, but this game doesn't the worst job. There is no action after you design your ships -- that is, you can't really do anything with them. To shorten this up: Don't waste your money on this cheap program."
3,OK,"Half of the game was entertaining but the missions were boring because, you the player, DOES NOTHING WHATSOEVER in missions."
1,This game makes all other Star Trek Games look bad.,"I bought this game thinking it would be cool, Design your own ships and take em out for a spin, Not the case! I could do a better job using MS Paint, Major Dispointment! Dont waste your money here, If you looking for a Star Trek game try Starfleet Command, It rocks."
1,looks are deceiving!,"I'm 8 years old and I love Star Trek. It's one of my favorite movies. But this game is REALLY bad. All you do is chose the crew, add onto the ship... then sit around and watch the computer do the rest. To have any fun, I guess you have to know computers really well, and be a programer. But for me, this was a waste of (hard earned) money."
4,CD,"Since this was a used CD, I wanted to know that it was in good shape, which it was, with no scratches to distort the music. Also, I received it in a matter of a few days and enjoy playing it very much."
4,A VERY GOOD READ,"Shelby Foote, the author of the massive Civil War: A narrative, looks at one battle (Shiloh) through the lives of six soliders. Although the soliders may be fictional, the author gives the impression that these were actual soliders. Although this book is no Killer Angels it is a very good account of the battle at Shiloh"
5,"Shelby Foote,Shiloh","What a wonderful novel,by Mr.Foote RIP.Our nations great historian of the Civil War,War of the States or War of Northern Aggression.Whatever floats your boat.The novel is exactly its title, the battle of Shiloh of which,Mr.Foote knew so much about.The book follows history but Shelby takes license with the dialog but no big deceit taking place here because Shelby studied and knew quite well how folks spoke back then.Sure we have no way to know exactly but thats not the point of the book.I read it the first time while reading book 1 of Mr.Foote's 3 book narrative, when he got to the battle of Shiloh and described it i then read Shiloh.Awesome!I just re-read it and it is just as good as the first time.I absolutley loved it and highly recommend it!!"
5,I liked It,"I read this as a study in prose styles; and ended up reading most the book in one night simply because I wanted to see what the different guys experienced! The juxtapositions of the different narratives leads the reader quite naturally through the two day battle, But the real charm is Shelby Foote's natural cadence and uncanny knack for capturing the ""voice"" of the different character's from different regions and all so seemingly. I wasn't even interested in the civil war before this book, and my interest in the conflict itself hasn't gone up tremendously, but this little novel woke up the human side of it for me... it well worth the read."
4,History mostly from the private soldier's perspective,"""Shiloh"" by noted Civil War historian Shelby Foote, is set during the Battle of Shiloh which was one of the most important battles of the Civil War. In this Battle Ulysses S. Grant showed himself to be a fighting general, and the South was threatened with being cut in two. This novel is told from a first person perspective by various Union and Confederate private soldiers. Foote succeeds admirably in capturing an atmosphere of authenticity, which is buttressed by his thorough historical research and knowledge of the war. Foote is a noted pro-Southerner, but for all that this novel is pretty even-handed. It makes for an enjoyable and insightful read.This one will not teach the reader the strategic details of this pivotal battle. Instead, it tells of the battle from the perspective of those fighting it, clouded by the fog of war, often not sure of who was winning and who was losing. Recommended. RJB."
4,"Very good, but not as good as his trilogy.","Well done from the standpoint of a soldiers point of view. However, not quite up to the scope his exceptional trilogy."
3,An interesting approach to a battle:,"I highly regard Foote's earlier works as a author of the Civil War such as his Civil War Trilogy and Vicksburg Beleagured City. Encouraged by his previous books I wanted to try this one. I was a bit discouraged by a novel-like writing although each story is based from history and tends build a great feel and understanding for the battle. In comparison to his Vicksburg book, this can not be done. If you are seeking a book based on events, dates, places, people and casualties this book isn't the one. If you are looking at a fictional character's account backed by history simply to feel certain aspects of the battle this is a great book. It reminds me of Shaara's Killer Angels about Gettysburg though doesn't live up to the expectations set by such a book. It is a mere attempt at fictional characters derived from actual history to portray events. On a brighter note, the writing is descriptive and truly places the reader on or at the events written."
3,Gratuitous.,"If you enjoy war tales, you'll find this one well told. For myself, I cannot determine what the point of the exercise is. Mr. Foote thinks the War of Northern Aggression was ""the American Iliad,"" but to my mind, Homeric ethics are at least 2,000 years passe'. Neither the neo-Gnostic Union nor the black-hating Confederacy strikes me as wonderful (though I certainly think one had a better legal argument than the other), so I don't get too worked up over these events. (My ancestors all fought in the U.S. Army, BTW.) Skip this one."
5,Awesome descriptions and accuracy,"You can tell Shelby Foote really did his research before sitting down to write this book. The book alternates point of view from chapter to chapter from the Confederacy to Union soldiers. Throughout the civil war novel, their are letters from the soldiers to their wives which Foote obtained from old manuscripts. In my opinion, even the weather adds to the accuracy of the novel. The major turning point of this book is when Johnston of the Confederacy is killed in battle which led to the advance of lost territory by the Union. If you feel you like you still need more info. on this thrilling novel please visit my website at the following"
1,I read his two books by the same titles i beleive-,and they were fun to read-but they won't make you a winner at the tables. If you want to have an advantage over the casino you have to learn how to count cards. My blackjack bible is Blackjack Bluebook II by Fred Renzey.Good luck to all!
5,OUTSTANDING NOVEL,"Absolutely one of the best reads I have had in a long time. I wish there were more people in the real world like Gabe storm-- I would want him at my back every step of the way. A great book,,should do well, I can see it going to number one soon.Encore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,fast paced fun,"This book is a fast-paced, intelligent, action/revenge story that was a lot of fun to read. It's one of those books you won't be able to put down and will read in one sitting. If you like Elmore Leonard novels you'll love Thick as Thieves."
2,Meh,"Maybe I received a bad shipment but this salsa didnt live up to the rave reviews. Like another reviewer stated, it is pretty bland - especially for those who prefer something with a little more kick.Also, almost every plastic bottle in my shipment looked like it was about to explode and basically did when opening the tamper-proof seal. Result was splattered salsa all over the place. Not worth the hassle."
3,"Not good,not bad","This CD is not great,but it's ok. My favorites on this CD are Tempter and Heathcliff. I bought this CD because I liked ""The Passion's price"" very much,but I think The Passions Price is way better.Anyway',it's still not bad."
1,THE CHILD DEVIANT!,"No way, major suckage! The only decent album Diva Destruction has put out is Passion's Price. It's all downhill from there...and what's funny is that she wasn't even sighned to a label when she put out Passion's Price. I'm sorry, but the more you listen to this album the more you want to make a freisbee out of it."
3,A first read for Hempel,"This book is full of descriptive short stories. This caused it to be a hard to read book. With all the descriptive detail it forced you to slow down and digest what you were reading. I am at the point where I don't if I should move on or try another. I am left wanting more after every story though and you end up with more than you bargain for with the short stories. The novella seemed to repeat some details from the short stories so I would get confused and start thinking about the last story. All in all, it was a short and decent read."
2,Uninteresting and uninspiring,"I really didn't like these stories. The narrative voice wasn't compelling, and when I finished, I usually thought, ""And? So what?"" Not recommended"
3,"Good at times, but inconsistent.","Some of the stories in this book are really good, but others just aren't. Having read and been totally blown away by two of Amy Hempel's other short story collections, I found this a little bit disappointing. Stories are interesting enough, and pleasant enough to read but seem more generic than some of her earlier work. I felt like I could have read them and not recognized tht they were the work of this great author. Most disappointing of all was the novella. Long and rambling and if there was a point I didn't get it. For better books by Amy Hempel, I strongly suggest both Reasons To Live and At The Gates Of The Animal Kingdom."
2,What?,"Honestly, I am still trying to work out the plot. Something about an energy vortex, then an evil woman, then a dead woman, and a husband finding her, then an evil woman, a little girl, and then an ""I see dead people"" moment where I think everything is supposed to come together and it doesn't. Yeah, it was pretty confusing."
3,A just alright movie,The movie itself really isnt that great but the reason I picked it up is because Julie Benz is in the movie. I am a big fan of Dexter and she is in that show as well. I would not have bought this movie if she was not in it.
3,Darkdrive,"The special effects in the movie were well done. The acting was adequate but the plot was confusing. In manner ways it was a cheaper knock off of the third Matrix movie where the hero is inserted into the matrix, a term used in the movie, to solve the problem of the now bodiless minds of the prisoners exiled into the matrix until they somehow die or get deleted from it. The only real plus in the movie is Julie Benz but her role is far too limited to save the movie."
2,Confusing story,The storyline was confusing and hard to follow. How did his wife get into the Matrix? The characters were mostly two-dimensional and devoid of any feeling (or acting ability?). Tilda was the most three dimensional character and actually had a personality! Some of the special effects were interesting though.
3,"Great looking film, for a low budget sci-fi-er.","This disc is worth buying for the awesome commentary alone! Hilarious! Don't try to make too much sense out of the story, but sit back and enjoy the eye candy! Not bad at all!"
5,Artists in Crime,"A well written murder mystery. If you love Martha Grimes, you will love Ngaio Marsh. The author throws the reader into the art culture of the 1930's England and adds a murder to capture interest into the book. With careful reading and logic, you care solve the mystery too. If you get confused during the story, Ngaio Marsh places several summaries of the clues within the story. The murder mystery is a delight to read from begining to end."
3,Not good enough,Having never read any of Ngaio Marsh's books before I thought I'd try the chronological approach. Apparently this wasn't such a good idea as according to other reviewers her better work was later. The book was well plotted and intelligent but ultimately I found the social scenery a bit dated and finally got on my nerves. It did keep me interested and I was surprised at the end. All in all not great but worth pursuing further
2,Shame its been cut.,This is the one of the best Oliver Twist adaptions I've seen. Shame Masterpiece Theater had to ruin it.People should be aware (I wasn't) that this version is 36 minutes shorter than the one shown on the BBC in the UK and the CBC in Canada. I don't know why American versions of British shows always have great chunks chopped out but it's very annoying as it disrupts the storyline.
2,An ersatz production of a dickens masterpiece,"I was thoroughly disappointed in both Masterpiece Theater and its production of Oliver Twist. The lengthy first disk contained virtually nothing out of the original Dickens novel. The characters behaved and spoke their lines as if they acting in a contemporary period made-for-TV melodrama. Oliver's father's wife seemed to trying out her lines for a voiceover as Disney's Cruella Deville. As far as a realistic portrayal of early Victorian life, viewers should remember that any man who took an umarried middle class woman's virginity was not, and never could be, a gentleman. The prtrayal of the Beadle and the other characters in the workhouse scenes were farcical. I ceased to watch at this point. For a classic depiction of the novel on film watch the 1948 British production directed by David Lean."
2,Oliver Twist,"Surprisingly disappointing Masterpiece Theater miniseries. This rarely delivers any kind of exceptional performance, nor is the story organized and true to the book. The talked-about prequel effect was entertaining, but when I think of ""Oliver Twist,"" I think of a cheery, more adventurous character. Worth seeing, but not at all a must-see."
3,Disappointed for classroom use.,"Though well intentioned, it is odd that this Oliver is rated so high. As a movie story it is excellent; however, as an adaptation of the story Charles Dickens wrote it is quite poor, I believe. The story sequence is initially reversed distracting from Dickens' intent. Characters and their relationship to each other does not follow the original story; some characters are used in place of others! The script writers either considered themselves superior to Dickens and/or they never actually read Oliver Twist. As a literature teacher I am sad that this fine theatre does not hold true to the story written by the master Charles Dickens."
1,Manufacturer's Defect,"Waste of money! Disc one will not play past chapter four, it pixelates then freezes. This was my second attempt to get this version of Oliver Twist for my daughter, both have defective discs. We will have to try another version. Even using a DVD/CD refinisher to polish the disc has no effect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
1,What is this?,"All period dramas are ""based upon"" an authors work but I have never viewed any such as this that has the audacity to create characters out of thin air in order to make up for the ineptness of the screenplay. To add characters to a story based on a Dickens novel - the author and creator of some of the best known characters in literature is silly in the attempt and has no chance of success. The editing is terrible and it is accompanied by a dreadful splash of horns and reeds. Fagan is portayed as a clown/magician. The bumbling Beadle in this screenplay is a womanizing leering creature. Andy Serkis and Emily Woof, who played Bill Sikes and Nancy were fortunate enough to receive the one small piece of the film that is believable. Where is the Dodger? Alun Armstrong and Keira Knightly should have stayed away. The Masterpiece Theatre narrator that proceeds each episode seems to apologize for what you are about to sit through. Dreadful."
4,CD: Hawaiian memories,"The description of the item said 'like new' so I was surprised when it was a CD from the Phoenix Public library. The quality of the CD is fine, so I am satisfied with the purchase."
3,Rugrats Discover America,"The movie was cute, and my 4 year old grandson liked it. The only reason I gave it a low rating was because much of it included material similar to ""The Rugrats Vacation."" Also, one of the cartoons seemed to be more about the grown-ups than the kids, so it became less interesting to my grandson than the other shows which focus on the babies. As usual, he watched it 5 times in a row, so he probably would rate it a 4 star video. I feel that the earlier cartoons which are more simple and less slick are more entertaining and funnier."
4,The other brother Har. Pre. # 533,"Kathryn Randle was engaged to Rex Kingersby, Kathryn worked for the Kingersby's, so she took some time off from work with her bosses blessings to drop some of her things off at Rex's flat. Kathryn found him in bed with his secertary Maxine Vernon, and Maxine explained it wasn't the first time, but Rex assured her Maxine meant nothing to him.Kathryn has a thing about faithfulness, and she gave Rex back his ring.Rex was in an accident soon after that, and his older bother Nate came to have Kathryn's head on a slab.Nate and the rest of the Kingersby blamed Kathryn for Rex's accident, all except her immediate boss George.The Kingersby's stared to close ranks against Kathryn, but she hung in there, until the truth came out.I also like Susan Fox, Rebecca Winters, Essie Summers, Betty Neels, Diana Palmer and Eva Rutland."
5,Key to the understanding of literature,"This book is not only suited for people preparing their break-through as a science-fiction author. Itis as well suited for all who care about books and do not just simply want to consume them.Instead of reading tons of boring theoretical papers on literature, those people should ratherconsider reading this book. Besides a theoretical introduction, it contains commented short-stories.A very good mixture."
2,"Not much on writing, A lot of OK but dated short stories","When I saw this at the library, I was super excited. Like, I was thinking, ""I write science fiction. I love science fiction! OMG, a clever debate about how to do it well!"" Unfortunately, this dated (1981) book throws out some mediocre writing advice (nothing bad, but nothing you didn't learn in literature 101) and then reads like ""pimp my stories"". Like, literally, you'll get a page stating something along the lines of ""plot is important"", which then skips over to some random science fiction story. It was depressing. Like, I could see this format working if the editor stepped in from time to time and said, ""You can see how the plot builds in this section"" or whatever. But as it is, I'm just left with some generic device and a not so great story following it."
5,Best Space Game EVER!!!,"As an ""old timer"" when it comes to gaming - over 25 years - this is the best Space Sim - check, best GAME, I've come across since the Civilization line. It DOES have a tutorial. It is EASY to learn. The trick is finding the right add-ons for your ship, which require you to travel around the immense universe and deal with many different species inhabiting the X-universe. Best graphics yet. Fly ANY ship from an ultra-fast scout ship to a full-blown capital ship - carrier or battleship. Wage war, fight pirates, trade for credits, build factories and automate trading throughout the universe. Follow the story line (much better than Freelancer's) or follow your own path to fame and fortune. Freelancer took all of three days to beat. Five months later, I'm still exploring the X-Universe. And Egosoft keeps coming out with free add-ons for registered owners! If you want entertainment and value for your gaming dollar, don't miss out on this one!"
5,Excellent Game!,"This is really an excellent game. It is much like freelancer, but even better.Main Favorite Features:1. You can do anything, not just follow the storyline.2. You can fly around in stations, your own, or someone else's.3. You begin fighting when you want to begin fighting.4. Their are HUGE carriers and transport ships you can pilot.5. Time device allows you to speed up gameplay (good for long journies if you don't have a jumpdrive).6. You can leave your ship and fly in your spacesuit if you wish.much more!Main features that need improvement:1. VERY hard to make money as a newbie.2. Bad instruction manual.3. Kind of hard to get the hang of it at first, but if you stick with it, it will get better!4. Can't land on planets.I would suggest this game to anyone who likes a good space sim. If you even remotely liked freelancer, then you should definately try this game, or at least the demo. 5 stars!"
3,Super cheap but had to be replaced twice,"I bought two chargers for $2/each. One worked, the other didn't. I contacted the company and they told me to return the defective charger (at my expense) and they would send a replacement. The replacement came and also did not work. I contacted them again and they sent another replacement. That one worked well. My suggestion, order more than you need at these prices and save the hassle of having to return defective chargers."
1,Disappointing,"The fit between the charger and my phone is not tight. In order to make sure the phone is charging I must 'wiggle"" the connection until I am sure the indicator lights are perfectly correct. I have not had, and do not have this problem with my other chargers."
1,Wrong charger,Not the charger for the phone it was advertised for. More junk for the junk drawer. Daughter was very disappointed.
1,Just not right!,"The description stated the charger was compatible with my Blackberry though it was not. Not sure if my order got mixed up or if the product details were inaccurate. Consequently, I still had to buy another charger."
3,Wall Charger,I bought this charger for my Blackberry 9630 Tour. For some reason I could not get it to fit so I gave it to a friend with a 8630 and it worked fine. I don't know what the deal was.
1,This guy sucks absolutely.,I hate these guys absolutely. He shipped the product after I canceled the order next day. The company has no regard for customer satisfaction.
4,Blackberry charger review,The product works as stated... Wish theBlackberry worked as well........ Anywaythis is a great product compared to what you'd pay in the BNM
5,Great price and great quality,"I got this charger in the mail a few days ago. The delivery was really fast! It took only about 2 days to get to my house. It works and gets the job done. That's all I was looking for, the price was great too! Now I don't have to use my computer anymore to charge my blackberry."
3,disappointment,When I receved this toy It worked for only a year then it stoped working.I bought new batteries and it still didn't work. It didn't play some of my CD's.
3,"If you need something cheap, go for","These earbuds are okay if you need something cheap (like if your old headphones broke during a trip and you went to a convenience store to get a temporary pair), but try out a more expensive pair for around 20 bucks.The pads fall of the earbud part very easily and are hard to find and put back on. The sound isn't that good, but it'ss not horrible.I had some trouble trying to get the buds into my ears, but with the pads on, they didn't fall out."
5,Great Starter Viedo,I think this is a great beigners viedo for someone who is just starting to train thier reterieve
5,The best Manga book ever!,"I can't believe this series has ended! With a little bit of mystery, humor, and love, the Zodiac P.I. series has put a smile on my face! No. 4 is my favorite book, with my zodiac sign in it! Natsumi Ando shows her genius in each book in the Zodiac P.I. series! Lili was the perfect main character, and this was the perfect manga series!"
5,Enemy of the State DVD,"AMAZING MOVIE! And great DVD quality. No scratched, came wrapped in plastic. Good buy... 10/10!"
2,Okay for action. Acting not very convincing.,"Ever see a movie that takes you so far that you actually see the characters as someone really talking in front of you? Will Smith, Lisa Bonet and Tom Sizemore (amongst the others), are acting too hard. They weren't convincing enough to make me feel like they were real characters. Again, the action was great. But the acting was contrived and predictable."
2,A bit much ....,"This movie reminded me of why I don't watch slick, big budget, big star hollywood movies. Slick is the operative word here. Far too slick. The camera work was disractingly slick. There were far too many convenient coincidences to make it believable. As the movie went on, it steadily diverged more and more from reality. If all of these high tech spy tools exist (call me naive, but I doubt it) I doubt they would all have been brought to bear to such a degree on one hapless guy. The NSA geeks sure had hard time catching Smith. That's because, despite all their whiz-bang gizmos, they were mostly a bunch of incompetent oafs. Lots of gratuitous chases were thrown in to wow the audiance. It was hard to get up the mental stamina to follow the plot, since I didn't really care about the fate of the good guys. This just isn't how you pace a movie to artfully develop real suspense. It was quite a disappointment for me."
