2,POS,Can't for the life of me figure out how the thing mounts or is stored on the bike once you get the damn thing on. Who writes the assemblydirections for these things? Is that job outsourced too? English people! Plain English!
5,Masterlock,"This arrived on time, and works as advertized. What else is there to say? I did find the lock combination wheels a bit ""stiff"", but a little working them around seemed to loosen them up well enough.Good solid cable lock, decent price."
3,Hard to find,Purchased this entire CD for the hard to find Wednesday Lover and was worth the purchase. Gotta love that song.
4,Oldie but goodie,"Good cd, been looking to buy for awhile, had been a hard find for me . Wednesday lover was main reason I bought cd."
5,Fun Ideas,This is a great compilation of the projects that are in the Family Fun magazines. From outdoor fun to creative decorating for kid's rooms. I bought this for my wife as a present and she loves it and my 2 year old son packs it around with him constantly.
5,enjoyable,"my kids enjoy this game very much. yes there is some repetition, but my kids don't seem to mind. in fact, challenging games get them frustrated. the graphics are good, and luckily, this one works with my windows 8."
4,"It's good, it's fun, not my favorite of the Freddi series though","It's an adventure and takes logic problem solving for the children. But when they reach for a game to play, it's usually Freddi Fish #2 or #3 that's replayed."
3,A little disappointed,"After playing the superb Schoolhouse game, my daughter and I were excited to play this one. Unfortunately it was a pretty big disappointment. There are some funny parts, but it lacks the depth of the earlier game. She finished it very quickly and put it away for good."
1,Will not work on Intel-based Macs,"Although you will find no documentation that states this, Freddi Fish 5, like all the Freddi Fish games, does not work on Intel-based Macs. We have a new Mac running OS-X, and the software claims that it can not run in the ""Classic Environment"". I assume that this is because Intel-based Macs were not in the picture when these games were first developed. So, the software assumes that this unfamiliar operating system must be the Classic Environment. We're quite disappointed in the software maker, and those distributing this software (including Amazon) for not disclosing this up-front when advertising/selling this software."
4,GREAT FUN,"I bought this game for our grandson, but after trying it out decided to buy one for myself (I'm almost 60) and I love to play it. Besides which I can guide our grandson when he visits. This game offers such much - problem solving, puzzles, manners and most of all GREAT FUN."
4,"No coconut, but decent service.",The seller was unable to provide one exactly as pictured.I opted for a refund. Their service was courteous and prompt.
3,Lighten Up!,"An interesting collection of songs with some driving arrangements, Give That Dog Some Peace might well be titled Give That Listener Some Peace! because of the affected, nearly maniacal vocal style of Gabriel Dorman, who just tries to do too much with too little throughout the session. The saving grace of the CD, aside from the captivating lyrics, is that Lili Anel sings with Dorman on many of the cuts, and her voice makes things much more interesting. If Dorman would lighten up a little, he could make a killer CD. As it stands, he has made an OK one."
3,Go U Bears,"I knew Gabe in college, and his music sensibilities have never been better. This is great folk, with a bit of gospel. The lyrics are quite spiritual, as if he is searching for a comfortable place in this great big world. Waterdance is haunting; freedom the same. Check out his sophomore effort ""Kissing Sister."""
1,poor,The screen on this phone doesn't have full or appropriate view. The letters/numbers are not completely formed. The instruction for setting up the phone were not user-friendly. It still isn't working in full compacity for me after 1 month. I am not super impressed with this product. I wish I had kept the box... I would have sent it back.
2,Mystery but not a fly fishing one,"Interesting tale and holds up as a mystery. Fly fishing is a minor influence in the book. The river is the setting and an undeveloped prop, folks carry fly rods, and a few simple fly tying recipes take up space. For me the enjoyment of fly fishing mysteries comes not only from the development of the mystery but to what degree the river and art of fly fishing become woven in as characters in the fabric of the book. It would surprise me if the author is an outdoor enthusiast."
4,Firehole River Murder: Yellowstone Fly-Fishing Mystery Series,"This is well written, with intresting character development and storyline. The author knows the area and captures the ""feel"" of West Yellowstone. Enjoy!"
4,sims2review,My son has very much enjoyed playing this game. I am very pleased at how fast it arrived and it was in perfect shape.
2,"Really, really boring.","I got this game a while ago, and spent hours trying to get to the ""fun part."" If you are looking for a leisurely game where you can do a few quests, make friends, and fill your house with furniture, this isn't it. Finding out where to go is like pulling teeth, aswell as making friends. And even though I played the game for a long time, my house never amounted to more than a bed, fridge, toilet, and shower."
2,This Is The Worst Sims Game Yet,"The Sims 2 for GBA is not very fun. It's not even okay, what I hate the most is the new sanity meter. It doesn't show your needs separately, and when you have a need it goes down like crazy until you fulfill it but you don't know what you need until it pops up over your head. There are a decent amount of places to go to, but there's nothing really there or anything cool or interesting to explore. It's also very cramped and it sometimes feels like you're running around in a maze. There is not very much interactivity between people. You could make out with someone you just met, it's not realistic like the past sim games were. There aren't cool objects like in the Sims for computer and for The Urbz. If you want a fun sims game, I'd suggest Sims Bustin Out for GBA or The Urbz for GBA or DS. This game was a waste of money, and It isn't fun."
1,there is no point in this game!!,i love the sims for gba.. or the other ones at least... you can skip episodes and it just doesn't make any sence.. get the urbz or bustin out cause this stinks....
1,What's new in this 9th Edtion?,"The answer is nothing. This 9th edition is practically the same as 8th. This author must be the greediest man in the academic circle. Over half of the colleges in US use this book for technical writing, and he's still charging people almost $84 for it. Hasn't he made enough money with the 1st edition already?"
3,This book is better than what some reviewers write!,"This book is written well and is a useful tool to use when writing everything from a resume and cover letter to a complete proposal. It also give instructions on how to make a web page and scripting in html. Although I am sure that this material is very similiar to that of the previous editions, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to write better.I wish that I had not read the previous bad reviews and ordered this book in hardcover instead of a used softcover."
4,Great product for the price,"This is an inexpensive but for the money, well built case. I don't have any complaints. My Fender Strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isn't the most durable case (I wouldn't use it to ship my guitar) it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next."
3,a step up from a gig bag,"It doesn't look bad & the inside is nice, locked it is secure & protective, but it has a flimsy feel & the latch tabs take effort to align. I got what the sale price amounted to & it beats a broken, scratched or dented guitar. I wish I had spent a bit more time looking at others & had been a bit more generous with my wallet for the sake of a better case."
5,Guitar Builder review,"I've been building guitars for more years than I care to count and I've started putting them in these cases. It's a high-quality product for the price, and I never have to wait 6 weeks to get it. It beats paying 160.00+ for a name tag on a case.My guitars are custom high quality and I trust them to these cases..."
3,"Objective, if limited in scope","Msgr. Gamber's classic on the Liturgy after the Second Vatican Council is a work unique in the field because of the highly objective and unemotional approach which he takes to the issue. While Msgr. Gamber works out of the faulty proposition that the liturgy (and theology) of the Council of Trent was organic rather than recationary, he nonetheless makes an assessment accurate to his experience, and the experience of many others, of what worship is, should be or can be.One is left to wonder, however, what conclusions might have been drawn if Msgr. Gamber had more experience to draw from in study of either pre-Constantinian worship or Eastern Orthodoxy. Three stars for an objective effort."
5,Excellent,"I just got this bag in the mail and it is more than I expected it to be. It doesn't scream ""camera bag"", is small but has tons of storage, and is very trendy - something you don't often find in a camera bag. Bravo Crumpler!"
4,"Nice, but has been censored","I saw this movie on cable and was delighted when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, the movie on the DVD has been censored: after Michael and Faith went on a date, they returned home and ended up on the couch kissing passionately (no nudity at all) when they are interrupted by the phone ringing (Brenda calling). Brenda asks Michael what he is doing and he says ""Nothing (much)"" or something like that. Of course this breaks the romantic mood and Faith goes to sleep. This scene lasts probably 20 - 30 seconds, but some idiot (....) has deleted this scene on the DVD.But of course when you look at the back of the DVD cover you'll find this: ""Feature Films for Families - Strengthening Traditional Values Through Entertainment"". Morons."
1,Varga Girls I,14 drawings done by Vargas; His art work is unquestionably good. The price that people are asking is way over being reasonable for what you get.
5,Excellent,"When I read this book I thought "" This is one of the best books ever! It is so totally gripping and veeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrryyyyyy tense! "", and you will think so to if you read it. It is sort-of a mix between 'Point Horror', and SWEET VALLEY UNIVERSITY. It was very cleverly written, and was a definite can't-put-down book. Leah"
4,witchcraft,An evil witch sets out to destroy Jessica's life!It is exciting because what SVU book isn't?!
4,A Comprehensive Text,"The text is a standard reference on the theory of ordinary differential equations (it is not easy reading but comprehensive and accurate). Topics covered include: existence and uniqueness theorems for equations with various degrees of smoothness; dependence of solutions on parameters and initial conditions; singular equations; Sturm-Liouville theory (completeness of the eigenfunctions, convergence of eigenfunction expansions and asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues); asymptotic solutions; o.d.e's in the complex plane and much, much more. The text includes at the end of each chapter a collection of problems which extend the theory developed in the chapter and lead the reader to explore related areas."
5,This is THE book,"if you want to learn more about ODEs than just how to solve them. I took a course on ODEs in a german university more than 30 years ago and the prof chose Coddington and Levinson. It was tough but I am very thankful now! It is so different from all these new ""ODEs for Dummies-type"" books with colour pictures all over and matlab, mathematica, maple or whatever in the foreground."
5,BB King,this CD is great there are a lot of tracks I have not heard before. This guy is a blues genius.
1,"You're joking, right?","BB King is a legendary bluesman, without question. This CD doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of BB's now 50+ year career. Yes, you have ""The Thrill Is Gone"" and ""Paying The Cost to be The Boss,"" and even ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" but there is so much more.I think the most surprising (and aggravating) omission is ""How Blue Can You Get,"" which is one of his signature tunes, and ""Rock Me Baby"" which was always one of my personal favorites. All in all, you can simply not truncate a 50-year career into ten songs.BB deserves better than this. You do too. Go for the ""Ultimate Collection."""
2,poor,start level 5 pointslength -1 pointno pre 60's tracks -1 pointcrossover tracks (although I like Into the night) -1 pointresult = 2 points - do not buy
2,Item was returned,"Sorry but I returned the album. The seller DID describe the condition accurately but when I saw it, I was dissatisfied to the degree of wear and tear. If I was in a store and picked it up, I wouldn't have purchased it. I was also dissapointed when I had to pay over $13 to ship it back. I won't be doing that again.In all fairness, I must say that the seller was very willing to grant the return. and very courteous.j"
2,Not in it's claimed 'good' condition.,"I ordered this in 'good' condition, but when I got it, it wasn't. First of all, the cover was only attached by one of the three sides that should be sealed. Then, there was all sorts of gunk on the actual record that made it impossible to play. I had to work for a good 5-10 minutes to get it off, and it still wasn't completely off, but is for the most part, playable. I was very disappointed."
2,Quick review,"Many of the books in this series, although formulaic, are worth reading.This particular entry is just dull and predictable, with flat characters. I think that by the time this book was published the formula connecting the books was becoming tired.Try Royal Coach, Fargo, or the last two books in this series."
4,Interesting,"After having read all the reviews, I thought this would be a revelation. Most of the recording is background music of many old songs. The songs are nice to listen to, but sometimes they are too much of a good thing. There's a lot more of that than of the stars, and the many outtakes of the co-stars that never made it into the film are so-so. The sound is good (much better than the Harvey Girls) but the stereo remixes are mostly wishful thinking. Good for Garland's recordings. If you LOVE the movie, get it before it disappears."
4,Space Rock Classic : fasten your seat belt for a real trip.,"Yup, it was my teen years and I was in Search of something different. I got my original Vinyl copy of this album at a pawn shop and even though it had a warp in it and it skipped, I loved this album. My favourites include Brain Storm and Lord of Light. This is a very spacey album and it has a lot of energy. This will not appeal to everyone. But, in my opinion one of the best Hawkwind albums."
3,A so-so studio cd...,"Hawkwind is one of the great overlooked bands of the early 70s, their most creative period. Having said that, this particular cd is at best an average effort. It is likely of most interest to fans of the truly outstanding live hawkwind cd who want to hear what the studio versions of the songs on ""Space Ritual"" sound like. Sadly, the live versions are far superior to the studio versions presented here. This is particularly true for the opening track, ""Brainstorm"" which is a powerful song on ""Space Ritual"" but which here sounds weak and anemic. That is also true of the other cuts on the cd. The bonus material included with this re-release is also nothing special. There are better hawkwind cds - unless you are a hard core fan, you're not likely to be impressed by this one."
5,A great tool for small businesses!,"As a writer myself (Quicken for Dummies and QuickBooks for Dummies) and a small business person and CPA, I think I appreciate more than most people the skill and craftmanship of a technology writer who knows how to make the complex simple, the tedious interesting, and the painstaking fun. Peter Kent is in that small group of writers who has this wonderful gift. Buy this book--you won't be sorry! BTW, I especially recommend this book to small business owners and managers who want to use the Internet as tool for boosting profits and gaining a competitive edge."
1,Erroneous and Misleading Information,"We had high aspirations and scrupulously read this book looking for guidance, all to no avail. This book contains incorrect and misleading information. We tried the various links for additional data many of which were no longer on the web. Others that we contacted via e-mail the response was not what was designated in the book. Peter and Tara provide their e-mail addresses, but they neither respond nor answer questions. The only conclusion that one can draw is that they crank out the books just to sell them and make a quick dollar. They don't really intend to be there for the consumer. This book was a total waste of money. The only thing that it is good for is the garbage or fireplace."
3,"Cose, good writer, bad read!","I felt that the book was well-written; I thought that it would have gave a solution to the problem not just re-state the facts. If you plant o get this book, save your time; check it out from the library."
3,UMMM.,"Well after reading a chapter I thought I would check it out, and sorry but that is what I should have done, checked it out. It was on point but I was looking for something new, something different. I never found it, but I have read other works by Cose that was thought provoking. So it may be a good read but at a different time."
4,Life Lessons,"I just finished reading Ellis Cose's ""The Envy of the World."" I would give it 5 stars, but I think that Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" is the only book that I would give 5 stars. Cose's book is a present that every African American father should give to his son. I don't think that Cose tried to re-invent the wheel with this book. He eloquently lays out those things that African American men must do in order to prosper. If I am fortunate enough to have a son, I will make sure that I pass the book on to him. Mr. Cose has written a valuable and must read book for African American men. Even though I think that Ellison's book is in a class of its own, I think that Cose's book provides the same armor that ""Invisible Man"" does. Bravo Bro!"
5,"Black men, this book is for you! Get it -- NOW!!","Thank God! Where have you been Mr. Cose? This work is a breath of fresh air. Toni Morrison is quoted here. I tripped over this book by accident in a retail bookstore. Thought I would read a page or two. Ended up reading the entire book in the store! I purchased the only 3 copies from the shelf. Poignant, informative, well-written, focused, concise. Every Black man and boy in America should read this book. It's an informative read for Black women, too, especially Black mothers."
5,Irresistably charming...,"Fred Astaire's voice is irresistably charming, and Ginger Rogers' sultry vocals aren't too shabby either. This CD is very enjoyable. I am a jazz record collector, and in my opinion Fred can really swing with his limited but very charming and photogenic voice. This is an essential CD for any comprehensive jazz collectors music library. Recommeded."
4,useful.,"If you use muscle testing or want to start using it this is an excellant book to learn from. It has great information, history, and examples. I picked it because it was the oldest and hopefully closest to the original research. I found that it re-inforced what I had learned about muscle testing and helped me confirm that I was not expecting anything it could not deliver."
2,"Define ""Clinical"" Kinesiology","I haven't finished reading the entire book, but it was not what I expected. I deal with sports and applied kinesiology so I was a bit confused when the book described ""clinical"" kinesiology using non-clinical methods. Very interesting application and more suitable for those interested in a holistic approach."
1,Can we rate lower than one!,"BUYER BE WARE!!!The worst pair of boots I've ever owned. Tag sizing is irrelevant to actual shoe size. A left and right Wolverine boot may not be the same size even though they are tagged as the same. Overall, Poor workmanship and OVERPRICED. Contacted Wolverine with no response. Would recommend purchasing Redwing boots instead of these. BUYER BE WARE!!!"
5,Things Are Tough All Over,"One of the best movies ever. It is the 3rd best Cheech and Chong movie (1 Up in Smoke, 2 Next Movie). I laughed through most of it. It doesn't have much weed but it is very funny. I think everyone should buy it. i've never met anyone who didn't love this movie. cheech and chong both play 2 roles, and they do it very well."
3,"Hillarious, but not their best movie.",This movie will keep you laughing with the antics of these two dope-heads. They get into more situations than the law allows and get out of them easily. Comical all the way.
2,An overall okay movie.,"Cheech and Chong's: Things are tough all over. The people at Amazon movie sales said that it was one of Cheech and Chong's funniest movies yet. I think Amazon was totally wrong. I found just one part of the movie to be funny, and that's it. I wish I could send it back and pick out a different Cheech and Chong movie, but I already opened the package."
4,An excellent account,Marion Carl is another hero with an exempliary record as were Butch Voris Jimmy Flatley and many others. A very interesting and informative book.
3,"Super Cute, But Uncomfortable","I adore the look of these shoes--they're really cute. Putting them on is a different story, however. I live in heels and never leave the house without an extra 3"" or more, but even I cried uncle after wearing these around for a few hours. Get them for the look, but don't expect to walk around much in them."
4,highlander,"It arrived on time, was a wonderful gift for someone who liked to watch fantasy/science fiction with a touch of the past and the future."
4,Worth the price,"I'm happy with if, even if there are the some defects on some of the DVDs (most players skip it). I've been enjoying the commentaries as well. Great value added."
3,nice show,"Not one of my personal top 10 shows, but enjoyable anyway.I ordered this item and Highlander:Raven separately, only to discover that Raven is included with this item already. $30 wasted on a duplicate.The image on Amazon's page is misleading, showing only 6 boxes instead of 7. Hopefully this review will help others avoid that mistake."
3,"So, so Highlander Review","While the content of what I was able to view was very good, I did have a problem with a few disks. The last disk of season two could not be read by my player, Missed the season finally. Two other disks had individual episodes that would not read. Tried the above on two other DVD players, same results.Good quality picture on my 46"" Samsung HDTV. Decent volume stabilization across DVDs. Pricing was better than most competitors.Over all decent, Frank"
5,Wonderful Series,"If you were a big fan of the TV series Highlander or a fan of Adrian Paul then this is a ""must have"" for you! You can watch the characters grow and mature and meet some new and interesting immortals. The best thing is you don't have to wait for the season to be renewed. A good touch through out many of the episodes was the friendships and trust that developed between the mortals and the immortals. The flashbacks added history and background to the story and the characters. The cost per disc is fantastic especially if you buy it used. It came to less than $10.00 per disc at the time I bought it. I bought the 6 sets used and had problems with Saeaon 6. The shipper replaced it, no questions asked."
2,first disc was not playable,good series but the quality of DVD was not good first season half hard to play and stopped often.first disc unplayable
4,Highlander-The Complete Series Seasons 1-6,I like this show and i wanted to get to watch over and over when i can
1,Would have been a 5 if the discs worked,"Some of the discs just didnt work. They werent even recognized by the player. I tried a dvd player, a blu ray player, my XBOX, and a PC. All of which have played dvds or their respective discs fine any other time needed to. I dont know what kind of cut rate Chinese (as it said they were made in China) discs they are using, but they lost an easy sale from me with this one... Twice actually, because I bought a second one to try again, same problem. With the same discs as a matter of fact."
5,Excellent video!,"I am a 2nd grade teacher and have shown this video to my students for the past 3 years. It's an excellent teaching tool and is best watched in a stop and talk format. My students always have questions and I find that if I stop the film and discuss what we have just seen, they can understand the concepts presented. I have shared it with my staff and many have purchased it for their personal video collections."
3,"Good Movie, but too Intense for young children","My 6 year old daughter came home very upset after viewing the movie at school. The movie is very intense and portrays ALL White people as bad! The real life footage is too deep for young children to assimilate. If you let your kids watch the Simpsons, then they will enjoy the Cartoon Characters. As an adult, I did enjoy the movie, though I would never have let my child watch it without being present to explain everything. She said MLK touched her heart, but she now has nightmares because she is so upset about him being killed, and ALL white people being so very mean. I think this movie would be more appropriate for 6th graders and up."
1,poor excuse for an educational video,"Why anyone in an educational setting would choose to show this video is beyond me.While it condemns stereotyping of blacks, it is rife with stereotypes of Southern whites. Come on teachers - preview what you intend to show and then suck it up if it isn't worth showing and you don't have an easy planning period. You can always read them a good book instead."
2,A Very Useful Tool to Perpetuate the Cult of Guilt,I have just read the review by another parent who claims this movie made her daughter feel all white people were bad. My six year old also came home and proceeded to inform me how all white people were bad. I am petitioning the school to no longer show this movie to such a young audience. The vivid pictures were entirely too strong for such young viewers who have difficulty understanding the time reference. My children and others their age are not intellectually mature enough maintain a time reference. Should not be viewed by children under 10 and then only with in depth discussion!
1,Bigoted Stereotyping,"Although this film had good historical footage of Dr. King's accomplishments and efforts on behalf of equality and civil rights, it presented an unfavorable stereotype of white men. There were no positive images of white men, instead all were portrayed as the corrupt southern sheriff types, bubbas, klan members, Deliverance types, and ignorant and racist. What a shame that the film is a perfect example of the bigoted stereotyping it attempts to condemn."
5,A great teaching tool,"I just finished showing this film to my second graders. Not only did it hold their attention, but they learned quite a bit about Martin Luther King Jr. and America as it once was. The animated format combined with real life footage was extremely effective and captured my younger viewer's attention. Having characters that spoke the kid's ""lingo"" helped make this a film children of today can relate to. We used this video as a springboard to discuss Dr. King and his accomplishments. I highly recommend this video to any parent or teacher."
1,"NOT for Children - Should be Rated ""R"" for Violence","This movie is NOT for children. It should be rated R for violence. My six-year-old daughter watched this at school and it left her terrified. She is still very afraid and it has been one month since she saw the movie at school. Please do NOT show this in school or to any young children as it should have a ""R"" rating."
5,Great Movie,"I love this movie and use it as a teaching tool (third grade). I already had it on VHS, but wanted it on DVD. It is easy for 8 and 9 year old children to watch and get an understanding of the life of Dr. King and other events of the Civil Rights Movement."
5,Rebecca Paisley Never Misses!!!,"I loved loved loved this book. It had me laughing one minute and crying the next. I don't know how Paisley comes up w/ all the funny dialogue...it's hilarious. I have all her books and anthologies. Her ""Midnight and Magnolias"" is fabulous, so is ""Heartstrings."" I wish Ms.Paisley would write more romances. Her older books should also be republished. They are all fantastic! Pick up a Paisley book somehow...you will not be disappointed. You have my guarantee on that!"
5,Diamonds and Dreams,"Love this light hearted fun book!! Could not put it down once I began reading. I love being able to load on my nook and read to my heart's content. Rebecca Paisley is my kind of author, I love all her books!!"
5,Rebecca Paisley Diamonds and Dreams,"This book was reccommended to me by one of my favorite authors, Sharon Sala. I absolutely loved the book!! Couldn't put it down! LOL....very sleepy today! I was laughing all the way through the book! Run, don't walk to the nearest Amazon internet site and purchase this book!!!"
2,Not worth the trouble,"This CD is the filler music from the film. The background compositions the editor uses for transitions without dialog and occasionally under dialog. The absence of such music is what distinguishes an ""English Movie"" for people my age. It's pleasant music, and occasionally lively as befits the film, but not worth the trouble to buy as a separate CD.The CD ""You've Got Mail"" (as opposed to ""M@il"" in this title) provides the eclectic mix of vocals from several performers that complement the actors' performances so well in this movie. Get that one, skip this one -- and watch the movie again to see if you can spot when these cuts are edited in behind the action. That's the best way to listen to them."
5,5 Star Movie & 5 Star Soundtrack.,There are 2 Soundtracks. Get both. Music is fantastic! Great collection of playful songs that you will love hearing over and over again!
4,Bouncy Score -- Just like the Movie,"Cute score, and stands well on its own. Makes you happy to listen to it."
5,Fantastic Album!,"I mainly bought the album for the hits like Private Eyes and I Can't Go for That, but I was pleased to find that all of the tracks are really enjoyable!"
5,I CAN go for this,"This follow-up to Hall & Oates's album, ""Voices,"" was fantastic. My favorite songs are ""I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)"" and ""Your Imagination."" I loved Hall & Oates's ""blue-eyed soul"" then and love it still."
4,Very detailed look at the German aristocracy,"This book has the distinction of having very few characters that's not a member of the German aristocracy. Set in Prussia in the 1870's, it is a story about reactionary aristocrats trying to reconcile with their declining political and social importance in the wake of rising industrialization and sudden unification of the German states.On another level, it is a story of an unhappy marriage and ruinous adultery, written with fastidious details. The pace of the plot is very slow, and Fontane uses no less than half of the book as his exposition to the meat of ths story. Unfortunately, this will turn off a lot of readers, and remains Effi Briest's most glaring shortcoming. But for the more patient readers, this book is a masterpiece."
1,Painfully dull,"I recently had to read this book for one of my classes and the only thing that grew out of me reading this book was a very deep hate for it. The story itself is very dull, there is very little exitement, some one who might like authors in the like of the Brontes or Austin might enjoy this book, but other than that, it is very hard to get into the story"
3,Effie Briest,"The novel itself is outstanding, a subtle restrained account of the interactions of a married couple in the context of late 19th century Germany. But the edition was beneath contempt. It was printed from a computer, but the transcription was filled with errors of the most elementary kind. Evidently, no human being (or even a good check program) looked at the product. The letter combination, ""ue,"" was invariably omitted, and a number of strange symbols made German names incomprehensible. Further, the edition was not complete. Several passages were summarized rather than presented in the original."
3,"If you don't lose keys, it's OK","This lock is well constructed, and easy to operate (though occasionally you have to fiddle with it a bit to get it to lock), but there's one potential issue that Master doesn't presently address. They have made no provision to supply spare keys. The type of key used is a new design that can't be cut on any commonly-available duplicating equipment, the blanks are not supplied, and Master stated to me that they do not make duplication service available from the factory either. As a result, if you need more than two keys, this is definitely not the lock for you. Kryptonite uses the same type of key, and will supply additional keys for Kryptonite locks for a reasonable charge upon request (you need the key code number from the head of the old key to order them), so it's obviously possible to supply replacement keys of this type, but Master won't do it."
3,Good But Not Highly Recommended,"This was the first Judy Garland Video Biography I ever got. I received it as a gift many years ago. I got it when I was trying to research information on Garland on my early days of being a fan of hers. I learned a lot from this video. It basically gives you the HIGHLIGHTS of Garland's life.This video pretty much just cuts to the chase of her life. Where than most biographies of Garland today by A&E; and The Biography Channel don't just cut to the chase of everything. They gave you every specific detail a Garland fan would want in a 1 - 2 hour video. But this video fails to pursue that.The only time I would recommend this to any person is if they are a NEW fan of Judy Garland. But if you are like me currently, and have been a fan of Judy for at least few years of Judy, this is HIGHLY NOT recommended to you then."
4,Good read for passing time,"This is a good book for the water closet or a trip in the car if you don't want to look out the window. The stories are funny, Zelany does a good job of communicating his stories in 10-20 pages, and his ideas are fairly original.Two of my favorites are Unicorn Variations, mostly because I like chess and beer, and this story has both. The second favorite story is ""Go Starless Into The Night"", I won't ruin it for you, but I thought it was very intriquing.Of course, there are a few stories along the way that could probably be considered ""filler"". Most notably his triple short short stories ""fire and ice...a very good year"". It's a nice idea, but it just left me feeling like he was trying to experiment with a new style and hadn't quite got the hang of it.Overall, it's a very good shorts collection, worth the read, but just realize that there are a few stories that look like they were put in there to fill out the volume."
4,Not good enough,"It's not a groundbreaking book, sorry. It's fun and easy to read, and it should be considered more as evening relaxation. I like it."
2,luke-warm,"This book skips around alot in my opinion. Although Anne has finally gotten John to return to her childhood home and settle down she is very troubled by his restlessness. John on the other hand is plaigued through the entire book with inner conflicts- his love for Anne which keeps him on the island, his immense longing for the military, which he adores, and his hate for having to be a slave owner. These troubles keep up with John and, in my opinion are never really solved. I think Anne and John's immense love for each other is the only thing good about the book. And even that is shattered at the end. I was very disappointed when I finished this book. Some advice-Don't read the sequel!"
2,Major disappointment,"I'm sorry to say that this book was a major disappointment. Volume 1 of this series, while somewhat fantastical, was ultimately engaging and left me hanging for this volume. Unfortunately, the character's actions seemed without motivation and destroyed the skillful set-up of the first book. By the end, you are left simply not caring any longer."
1,Worst piece of junk ever purchased...don't do it,"This dresser is quite possibly the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. It weighs a ton, is so poorly made, the drawers are very shallow and impossible to pull out. I can't even believe Target would put their brand on this product. Don't waste your money thinking that this is a nice cheap dresser...it's a complete waste! Look at the reviews on Target...eveyone agrees with me."
3,not bad,"this movie is pretty good it tells a good story. I'm not a religious person, however i still enjoyed this movie. i got it for $4.00 so it way definately worth the money."
3,It was ok but...,"It was ok but not as good as the ""The Ten Commandments"", the acting wasn't that good either but because it was a bible movie it was still ok."
1,The Ten Commandments,This is not the original Ten commandments movie. I did not see any where before buying. It was a mistake. It is nowhere closer to the original one.
3,Bob & Tricia Henning,"I have to laugh at the other reviewers saying this and that wasn't accurate.Now who's to say what is and what isn't, unless you were there! Highly unlikely I would say.A different perspective of an age old question. We enjoyed the movie and for the money spent, they did a fine job.When the movie was over and I asked my wife how she liked it, she said it was good, ""but it's not an epic!"" Did anyone ever think that there could be another Moses? Just as the burning bush told Moses in the '56 film,"" I am, who I am!"" You KNEW who he was. To this day, when someone speaks of Moses, you picture one man. I don't have to tell you........."
5,The Ten Commandments,This version was very good. I wish the version with Charleton Heston was available in Blue Ray. But enjoyed this version.
1,Save your money,"Terrible script and mediocre acting is a generous description. If you are looking for historical or biblical insights to this era, this video is, from my perspective, the result of a poor imagination and a small budget."
4,NOT a remake,"First, this is definitely not a remake of the 1956 DeMille film. This story is complete in and of itself. It could have been named Moses with the in depth attention to his personal experiences. Fairly close to scripture and very entertaining, this is a biblical drama that might surprise you."
3,"Nice dusty, crunchy biblical romp","Can't hold a candle to Heston's 1956 defining 10 Commandments. But who cares! This new 07 version has heart. Well acted, historically correct on many levels, great desert scenery makes for nice dusty, crunchy biblical romp. Pharaoh's charging chariots on the dusty horizon is right on. Pure psychological Late Bronze Age warfare the Egyptians excelled in. Good mixture of humor, FX, and biblical drama. A good Easter season DVD."
4,My Review,This Movie was pretty good.It was in great condition.Not as good as the original Ten Commandments. The quality of the product was great.
3,Not bad but could have been better.,"This was an ""OK"" rendition of the Exodus. The cast is very good. The props and visual effects are top notch. The only problem I have with the film is that is strays from the Bible account of the story. Lots of things are left out or changed entirely. This is why I give it three stars. If you have never read the story of the Exodus in the Bible, I think you will enjoy it. However, I encourage you to read the Bible version of the story because its action packed and very exciting. Also, this way you get the true story with nothing left out or changed."
5,THE TEN COMMANDMENTS,THIS MOVIE IS THE STORY OF MOSES AND HIS MANY OBSTACLES ENCOUNTERED ALONG HIS JOURNEYS TO RIGHT THE ATROCITIES COMMITED TO ALL THE EGYPTIAN SLAVES. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE EPOCH STARRING CHARLESTON HESTON AND YUL BRENNER. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE MORE BECAUSE IT SEEMS MORE BELIEVABLE. I FOUND IT ENTERTAINING AND EVEN FUNNY AT TIMES
3,Good,"Some discrepancies from scripture; nothing too major, though... as long as you know the difference between what is in scripture and what the film maker decided would make a better movie. Great special effects."
2,Poor acting and Poor Representation of Scripture,"The only good thing about this movie was the special effects involved in the parting of the sea of reeds. Indeed, this was well done.The acting, direction, and the script was an absolute abomination from the reference point of any reasonable level of inspection.Now, I know that artistic license is usually taken in the production of such a movie, but if one wants to make a movie that involves some made-up items added to the actual story, then he should at least make it interesting and meaningful.You want to see a good movie? Then see 'Moses' starring Ben Kingsley."
2,"Functions, but you get what you pay for.","This charger functions as advertised and the price is right, but the battery doesn't sit snugly inside it, as it does in the Panasonic charger, so be careful not to jostle it. It's also significantly bulkier than the Panny charger. Build quality is what you'd expect. You get what you pay for. Gets the job done, though.Cta Digital Mini Battery Charger for Panasonic CGA-S005"
2,Not recommended,The metal coil/wire started rusting within a year. The numbers started wearing off around the same time. Really poor quality and construction - BROKE after about two years. One of the combination dials just broke and fell off while I was riding the bike. Now I have to cut the wire to get it off my bike.
5,"Great songs, charmingly sung","Great music, but you already knew that from seeing the movies.Only ""But where are You"" and ""Final"" aren't keepers.The sound quality...well, it was copied off the movies, so it's neither better nor worse than you might expect.This CD has the most of the music from the movies, so that means of the songs have the song followed by a good 5 minutes of instrumental-with-tap-dancing. Personally, I like this, but if you want ONLY the songs, you may prefer a different collection."
2,Boring!,"Usually, Caroline B. Cooney is enthralling when she tells a story, but throughout the entire book, I was bored, bored, bored. This book is actually three books in one, and all three were equally dull. The same discriptions were used over and over, and the characters were boring and lifeless, and it could hardly hold my interest. I am not one to not finish a book once I start, and that is the only reason I was able to finish. Please, save the money on this one and buy one of her better ones, such as Flight 116 is Down, or The Stranger."
2,Vampires Promise,"I didn't like this book at all, but the author tricked me a few times. I thought the book would scare me but it didn't so I gave it two star rating. My favorite part was the beginning when stuff started happening."
2,"Horrible, yet I still can't stop reading it.","Really poorly written. The stories are not developed well. Don't waste your time if you are looking for a new vampire book to read. Stick with the Twilight Series or Vampire Diaries.If I weren't compulsive about finishing any book I've started, I would have thrown this one out a long time ago."
3,Hawkwind's Blast-Off Into Space,"Marking a turn from Acid to Spacerock,Hawkwind's""In Search of Space""album chronicles the band's early,primitive beginnings. Utilizing standard rock instruments(-electric guitar,bass,drums, etc.)and an increasing number of electronics(-audio generators, effects,etc.)the album heralds the bands first excursions into the Space realm that made them famous.Solid drumming and bass work form the foundation of this album with Brock's hamfisted electric and acoustic strumming adding the ever important rhythm. The band's Electronics Gnomes add a complimentary ""icing"" of oscillator sweeps and sonic atomospherics to the rock proceedings. The tracks ""Shouldn't Do That"" and ""Master of the Universe"" being the album's standout cuts.Three newly added tracks add to this album's value.For more info on Hawkwind and the Spacerock scene visit the ""All Time Classics"" Webpage..."
4,Another one of Hawkwind's classics,"I heard this in about 9th Grade back in the 70's and I own the Vinyl copy. Master of the Universe is probably my favorite track. OK, ""Shouldn't do that"" does go on for a long time but it's a trip. This music will appeal to those that want to achieve a certain state of mind. This is spaced-out metal for those that like to explore the outer fringes of music. Not recommended for the middle-of-the-road crowd."
4,RIYL,"I live in Portland, so I was able to see these guys a bunch of times. I loved their live shows and with the singer doing a great Iggy impersonation it was easy to get past his flat vocals. The band has a new singer and a similar but new sound. They are called Consulate and I am having a hard time even holding this disk in my hand now. If you liked this band or are interested in some new music, do yourself a favor and check out Consulate."
5,This one is Classic Diana!!,"After being so disapointed with her latest Mira release, The Texas Ranger, I was so hoping she would return to her classic style in her new Silhouette, The Last Mercenary, which tells the long awaited story of Micah Steele, and believe me, if you are a true Palmer fan......You will be thrilled!! Palmer returns to her unique and familiar writing style which has made her a favorite among her fans. It was exciting to see the remaining single Hart brothers, Rey and Leo, make a brief appearance towards the end, with promises for their own stories in 2002!! Avid Palmer fans.....She's back!!!"
4,The Last Mercenary,I really liked the book. I had already read the other books with the same characters. It was a continuation of these men's lives.The ending is alittle corny. The beginning grabs you and keeps you entertained thru most of the book.
4,Loved the story,Great book. Diana Palmer has done it again. I just started reading her books and have enjoyed everyone.
5,The Last Mercenary by Diana Palmer,"I Gave this book the highest rating, because it is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read.The romance was wonderful, I cryed, I laughed. IT is one of those books that once you start to read it is very hard to put down.Diana Palmer is a wonderful writer, she has been Blessed in the writing field."
2,I am a DP fan BUT...............................,I am a long time Diana Palmer fan but this was a bit boring. It seems that there was a lack of drama and just a retelling of old bits of other stories. I am not exactly sure why so many of the latest works by DP have been disappointing. It was a pleasant light but not stellar. I could have skipped the book and just read the summary.
1,The Last Mercenary,I have to agree with the other reviews. It's time for Diana Palmer to switch it up. Same plot different characters. It's getting very stale. I think this may be the last book I read of hers unless she changes her same basic story plot.
1,"Please, please, please..","I am a big Diana Palmer fan but I am getting tired of reading about the same old dowdy dressing, ""virginal"" heroines who give timid a bad name. It is unbelievable to me that a woman (Callie)in her twenties could act as if she doesn't have a clue what sex is and in the next breath have feelings for a man who I felt bordered on the abusive end of the totem pole. Micah came off as an arrogant jerk which only made Callie look worse for the wear. I seen no romance or build up in this story at all and it took me a month to read it after putting it down many times in disgust. I hope her newer books hold more promise than the past few she has written."
1,Not so good!,"After having read ""Lord of the Desert"", which I really loved, I rushed to buy this book. The hero Micah is OK but the heroine Callie, Good God, her lack of information is so impressive and outrageous that it seems Callie had never been to school and had no access to any kind of information at all (that includes TV, radio, newspapers and magazines). Very disapointing!"
2,ONE FOR THE DOGS,"This direct to video release is another one of those rich people who die and leave their fortunes to the family pet and one of the relatives decides to kidnap the dog and demand a ransom and/or get ownership by making the kindhearted guardian look irresponsible. It's been done a lot of times and this is not one of the more successful attempts.Dean Cain doesn't look comfortable in his role as a bespectacled nerdish kind of guy; Dean needs to stay in action movies where his good looks and physique are better utilized. Tim Curry and Jennifer Tilly chew up the scenery shamelessly and although they're fun for a while, their shenanigans become redundant and overused. Bailey is a pretty dog and the kids are insufferably cute, but the movie is really rather boring. For younger kids only."
5,Algebra-success in 20 minutes a day,I am a homeschooling mother who is now in the process of teaching one class in algebra and one class in geometry. I did take these classes in high school myself but it has been over 30 years and I barely passed both classes. I had never really grasped some of the basic concepts and now I had to somehow get these concepts across to my children. I do have regular school books to teach from and have been able to do an adequate job but it has been a struggle until I found this book. The basic ideas of algebra are clearly laid out without alot of extra words that are sometimes found in regular texts. You are led step-by-step with tests throughout each chapter to make sure you understand each idea before you go on. A wonderful supplement to the regular text book.
5,Great Workbook,"My daughter is a struggling 8th grade reader getting ready for high school. We have been going through this workbook together during the summer months. Not only does this book have a good plan and layout for her to use but we also have opportunities for talking time with her. I really recommend this workbook for parents of kids who don't like school, smile."
3,A SECOND EDITION SHOULDN'T HAVE ERRORS AND TYPOS,"and this one has a LOT! The word problems are usually poorly written- i.e., ""Write an equality and then solve each word problem ... You ordinarily get paid $5 an hour at your part time job. You can earn $10 an hour if you work on a holiday. How many hours would you have to work on Christmas to earn at least $100? Let x = the number of hours of regular hours worked and let y = the number of hours worked on a holiday"". Isn't the answer, let's see- y is greater than or equal to 10 (hours)? According to the book though, the setup is actually 5x + 10y is greater than or equal to $100 and the answer is y is greater than or equal to -1/2 x + 10. Unfortunately, sloppy wording is typical of the word problems in this book.Having said that though, the book explains most concepts carefully and in detail. It has potential in a future edition if someone cleans it up and adds the missing concepts and details."
5,Saves alot of time and money,This book along with practical algebra have helped me become a great math student.
3,Helpful but could be better,"I'm reading this book to refresh my memory of math classes from long ago. I originally made it through calculus, but am finding now close to 20 years later I can't remember a bit of it. I actually liked math and did very well in those classes way back when so I may not be the target audience.Even so...some parts of this book so far are a little frustrating. Most of the examples are pretty straight forward..but then some of the problems they'll throw something in there they haven't explained yet, and the answer key doesn't explain it either. So then I have to go back and rework the problem till I get the same answer, and deduce the rules from the answer. Also the story problems are a bit unclear.Its got a nice clean layout, and good font. And.. ..probably an odd consideration ...but the paper is a nice texture for writing on."
2,Too many errors,"I used this book to help my students learn Algebra. Unfortunately, there are way too many errors in the book for it to be helpful."
2,Errors in Answers,"Although this book does a good job explaining, be careful - the solutions have MANY errors."
1,Not For Teaching,"The book and series of books are very good for improving your own skills but its layout does not lend itself for teaching. The answers are imbeded in the book and can not be removed or even covered up to test a student. The book could easily be redisgned to move all the answers to the back of the book and even could be designed for easy removal. Also, the online test are not chaptere based but more of an overall review after you have finished the entire book. I bought this book to add to my childs homework studies but was very disappointed because of its construction limitations. In fact, I bought five different books from math to reading and they all had the same construction pitfall."
5,"""Hey man, big stick!""","Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams is one of the best in the series. Here the far out duo have finally found the scam beyond their wildest dreams, selling ""specially mixed"" ice cream. Great sences, some of the funniest things about this one is the small talk between the two like the Hippie Retirement home and Voto Land. Really funny things are their underground pot garden and the whole idea of selling dope in a ice cream truck.Hilarious moments, save the whales song, making lunch, ""do you like yours medium rare?"", ""I can smell cops a mile away man, they smell like coffee and donuts."", ""Come on get after them man they want a big stick!"" Recomended for any C&C fan!"
2,The connection between Dave Williams and Jon Finkel,"They both made a decent amount of money playing Magic, then went on to make even more money gambling. Finkel is From New Jersey, Williams from Texas. I was not aware of any connection between the two of them in terms of being on the same team or similar. Eric Froelich, to my knowledge, was a friend of Finkel's and was a very young winner of a WSOP bracelet, and I believe got a slight mention in the book.The author is clearly trying to force a connectin between two things that have enough in common that people automatically assume more than the author says. The story isn't that compelling, and Finkel's attitude towards Magic these days is decidedly poor. There is no reason to glorify him at all."
3,Great Story Told Terribly,"Jon Finkel is a great guy with a great story. Unfortunately, that story is not told very well in this book. There are just so many things that are blatantly wrong, as this book is dying for an editor (I really don't believe Jon told his father that 4 in binary is 1100, as depicted in the excerpt from the book available on Amazon, as this would be a rather unimpressive response). The author also tries to force the story of David Williams into the life of Jon Finkel, which is clearly wrong as there is little to no relation between them other than spending some time together in the late 90s. I suppose this was to try to make the story sound more appealing, as Williams won 3.5 million at the WSOP in 2004, but it has nothing to do with the story. Jon's life is interesting enough without that, but not enough detail is included as the story goes off in various places with irrelevant information."
2,Not That Interesting,"Jon Finkel was obviously a very bright boy who grew up heckled and hazed until taking up a trading-card game called Magic: The Gathering. He initially flunked out of Rutgers, then re-entered and did much better. After his success transformed Jon into a cool world champion he moved into poker rooms, than a card-counting blackjack team, and finally to the World Series of Poker. In the process, he cast off his nerdy looks by investing in contacts and nice clothes, and losing about 65 pounds (from 250 to 185). When we leave Jon at the end of the book he is en route to a $2-3 million winning year.Little/no drama, and not that interesting."
4,Great price and great product!,"Does what its suppose to do, dont buy a clutch kit without this tool! You will need this to compress the clutch spring properly to take the retaining clip off."
2,barnett clutch tool,barnett clutch spring compressing tool works so so not all that impressed with came with 2 bolts witch did not work so had to modify it with different one hard time getting lock spring out beginning to wonder if it was made for a different bike than mine tool is made well have to see how much fun I have when I get ready to put clutches back in can hardly wait haha
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I have been looking for a Camera Gadget Bag for my Z650 Digital Camera and DCR DVD650 Digital Video Camera, and with this bag everything fits just right. All the Cables and Batteries and Battery charger for the video camera and the filters for the Z650. It was just what I was looking for."
4,Sachel for a Kokak Z980 camera,"Kodak Large Black Graphite Camera BagMy Kodak 2000 has a bag that is too small for the new Z980 camera. Subject bag is just the right size for the new camera. And it has pockets for carrying accessories on my photo-runs. As for me, this camera bag is a keeper."
4,camera bag,It was fine smaller than expected. But it will work for me.It arrived timely and packaged well.Dale
3,Large? Really?,"Bought this for the new Kodak Max camera I purchased. Bag is well made and padded. The camera with a wide band neck strap barely fits with all of the dividers pushed against one side. The outside pocket is just big enough for the charger . The bottom compartment is ok for cables, etc. Kudos to the vendor for shipping the item same day. Had to wait till I received the camera from amazon to write this."
1,Really??,"This DVD was not useful for me. I already knew the information and there was useless advice pointing to other DVDS. I didn't spend this much money to be pointed to spend more money. It's a waste of time and isn't even useful for professionals. If it wasn't too much of a process, I'd ask for a refund!!! If you see this Amazon, I'd stop selliing this DVD and make that company refund everyone who bought it."
3,Medicine Organizer,"This is ok. I recently took it with me out of town and when I arrive some of the pills had fallen out. This was kind of annoying as I wasn't sure which day they come from. Also, wasn't completely sure I had found all the ones that spilled out.It does it's job for the most part, but I now put it in a specific pouch so that at least if the pills spill out I don't lose them."
1,Don't waste your money,"I own this book. I also own the other books by this author. After doing some research on the author and this group, I am very sorry I spent any money. All kaleidoscope books by this author are just propaganda for the author and her business...the Brewster Society. The books leave many talented, and in some cases very influential, artists out. It is rare if anyone represented in her books doesn't belong to her group (there are exceptions, but only because they already had a reputation before Cozy wrote about them). A lot of good dealers are left out (on purpose), and a lot of great kaleidoscope photographers are left out. This is Mrs. Baker's idea of what the kaleidoscope world should be and not a true representation of the real kaleidoscope world at all! Save your money!"
4,Fantastic Illustrations,"Within a day after getting this book I had finished reading it. The book's strongest point is its illustrations: paintings of what artists thought the Vikings looked like; maps; and photos of Viking artifacts, ruins and habitats.The last portion of the book consists of excerpts from writings by or about the Norsemen.The text suffers slightly by being a translation. It implies that Weland the Smith was a real person. I doubt that the author originally intended to give that impression.I noticed a slight error at one point in the book. The number of doors in Valhalla magically grew from 540 to 550 in just a few pages!The Vikings are a fascinating subject, and this book does them justice. So if you are interested in the Vikings you will enjoy it and learn much as well."
4,Great,"I'm not a big fan of the Mamas and the Papas, but I do like several of their songs, making this an excellent buy.However, if you're a more dedicated fan, I don't suggest that you buy this particular compilation"
1,Instrumental very loud - vocal very soft,"The first two songs on this cd are fine. After that, the instrutmental section is so loud that you can hardly hear the vocals. I found the same to be true on the cd of the Greatest Hits by the Mamas and Papas. Very disappointed!"
4,A Great Addition to Your Library Unless You're a Completist,"If you only want an excellent sampling of this supergroup of the '60's, this is a fine, and economical addition to your library. It has all their most reknown songs, and, contrary to the other review, the sound is very good, albeit typical of the '60's sound. I feel that all of the ""20th Century Masters"" CD's are a good buy if you're only looking for a sampling of the represented artists. Sure, there are more thorough compilations, but they cost more too!"
4,"Good songs, but too few of them","One can hardly complain about the songs on this CD- all of them are wonderful. The problem is, why so few of them? Why would someone take a few songs from a great album and reproduce it with fewer of them? Skip this and go for the Greatest Hits instead."
4,Supreme Bowhunting Video,"In keeping with Stoney Wolf's tradition of fine videography, this effort follows avid bowhunters on their quest for the ultimate bowhunting challenge... taking big Mule Deer bucks in open country. The video is superb. Well filmed under difficult conditons and is the finest in outdoor sports. This is a ""must see"" video for the archer or mule deer hunter. It is accurate, and honest. The scenery is spectacular and the quarry is elusive, wary and everything you'd expect it to be."
2,"Some fun moments, but a little disappointing; the visual flow was horrible in the Kindle edition","This is the second book I've read by Tom Holt and was a little disappointed. I think the premise was interesting and there were some fun moments; it was a diverting read, but nothing great. The Kindle price was < $9when I bought it, so for the price it wasn't too bad of a read.There was one thing, though, that made reading the Kindle edition difficult: there were HUGE spaces between paragraphs. Now, I do have the typesetting on my Kindle one size larger than the font that came pre-set, so this may have had some impact, but it really broke up the flow of the storyline to have a total of 3 paragraphs, each only 1-2 lines/sentences, on one page in many places. I felt the visual flow could have been MUCH better than it was. This caused me to deduct a star from my rating."
4,rather fun,"Wish You Were Here has a clever premise, which I won't belabor as the other review has it covered. I found myself returning to each section eagerly to see what would happen next. It is somewhat different in style than Holt's earlier books- not quite as smart-assy- if one will forgive the expression, and the humour is well integrated with the plot and characters. The end of the book was, perhaps, not all that the development part of the book promised, but overall the book was so enjoyable that it was forgiveable."
2,Interesting but sadly outdated,"This book has sections on each room in the home, beginning with the kitchen, and proceeding to dining room, living room, bedroom, and bath. For each room it offers 3-5 different ""styles"" from country to contemporary, highlighting features that will magically transform your shabby room and furniture into a dreamworld, if only it were that easy... The authors give step by step instructions for one or two DIY projects that will be a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, almost all of these include contact paper, paint, or an incredible imagination.The recommended updates are a little out-dated -- particularly for the kids' rooms. The projects are all very superficial, and while they could be done cheaply, they would always appear to be just that: cheap. Some of the style comments are on target, but those can be found in any decent home design guide. This isn't one of the better books available."
2,rework/rehash of other book by same author,"Although it does not say on the description page,when I recieved the book I could immediately tell that it was similar to an older version (which I also had)The old book is called ""Automated Home Control"" , ""Design and Installation & Programming Manual. X-10 and Hardwired I/O Based Systems"" 2nd edition by Silent Servant Home Control Inc. 1998The book really covers the X10 controllers Stargate and CommStar, together with other X10 stuff from Leviton, et, all.It shows many wiring diagrams, but not programming.It has good ideas illustrated within it, but I do not find it worth the cost.I would say only for the X10 fan. Others should stay away.Stefan Decuypere"
5,Great Information,This is the only home automation book I have found that gave me over 140 reason to automated my home. It is well done.
1,Poor guide for the title subject,If you are looking for a step by step guide to automate anything in your home this book is not going to help you. It has very simple rough diagrams using 2 systems and is more of an idea book on what you can automate than it is a book on how you can do it.
2,not enough detail for city streets,"It's a good regional map, but your average guidebook has more detailed urban maps (I recommend ""New Japan Solo""). The subway maps look pretty good, but you can probably get those for free."
1,A useless collection,"I'll make this one quick.'20th Century Masters' has a few standout releases. Notice those: A FEW. This is not one of them. Muddy Waters is a legend, and to condense his career with the Chess label in just 11 songs, ESPECIALLY with at least 30 compilations that are better. Yes, what's here is great, but it's what's missing that's the problem. 'You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had,' 'You Shook Me,' 'Sad Letter Blues,' 'She's Alright,' and countless others aren't here when they should be.They completely screwed up B.B. King's edition, and Howlin' Wolf's isn't much better, but Muddy's edition is the absolute worst. Go buy both volumes of 'His Best.' Or 'The Anthology 1947-1972.' ANYTHING except this. This is unnecessary. I don't recommend this collection at all. It's MCA trying to cash in Muddy's name. This isn't even recommended as a starting point. Only recommended if you can find it for $0.01 in a bargain or cut-out bin.NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Was ok,"Ok I understand now how important these reviews are! I now use these reviews for all my purchases so now I find it mandatory to write now for every purchase I make:) [...]This unit was just ok in my book, I opened it up and it feels cheaply built, however it works (unless you spill beer on it, which I did)."

3,"Great hero, but the heroine didn't communicate enough","Lord Freddie is a wonderful hero. Everyone else thinks that Anne Webster had a child out of wedlock, and they treat her like dirt and call her names. Even her father treated her badly by the way he drafted his will. Freddie goes out of his way to treat Anne well. She was, after all, his first love.However, Anne has a secret. The child isn't hers -- but she refuses to share this information with the people around her. She had good reasons for not telling the local gossips the truth... but at the same time, she should have told Freddie!If you hate romances with overly cute children, don't be afraid of this one. Ian is adorable, but not cloying.I wish I could rate this as a 3.5 because it's not really a 3, but Anne's secrecy keeps this from being a real 4."
5,"""Girl"" Power","I am so grateful that my friend from the UK recommended Amy's first single JUST A LITTLE GIRL to me. It is refreshing to see and hear a new artist who is not afraid to be herself. The video shows her desire to stand up + be noticed, plus it has brilliant direction - kind of an Alice in Wonderland for 2002 kick. The song starts off gently, with soft vocals and backing piano - then the chorus erupts into rock. It continues back and forth, with quaint verses going into all-out chorus and back again. This is just the kind of song to listen to at the end of a long day, or when someone is patronizing you. I look forward to hearing more from Amy."
5,the best !! new and old for life,"Amy is the best I have heard from in a long time. She does what she want's & how she feels! She doesn't let anyone tell her how ""her "" music should be . ( Like alot of other singers do ) You can see in the type of songs she sings and videos she does that thats her & you can like it or not!! She is brilliant & the way she said the words to ""just a litte girl"" were ""Supposed to be the black & white of how people see ""just a little girl"". The verses are the white, girly & pritty & then the chorus is the black , more complex side."" Plus the part where she is in a coffin in the video ""thats the warning that you can't treat people like that . You'll get in trouble"". I can't wait to see what eles she has . But I think as long as she stays true to her self then she will be bigger then Justin & Brit together!!! You go for it , Love the video...."
5,No more miss nice girl...!:),All I have to say is... It's about time someone like her is in the music world today. I'm sick of Britney. Amy rocks!!!!:)
4,Cant live without it,I use this tool quite a bit and it works fine the only thing is the boots on the test lead can get in the way but if its too much you can make your own. If you work around rj11 and 45 jacks and need to trouble shoot you need one get it.
1,tomaphone,"This item is poor quality designed by someone who never used a buttset. The copper clip attachments are too small, and very thin copper. There should be a hole to stick the butt set clips in. I would buy the banjo."
4,works good,it seems that mixing your mood is the trick maybe keeping just a little wet but to much tends to create wet spots i have only used the white tip and three pares of gogles would be better because it seems to throw more out to the sides than an air hooper but i have had good results just stay away from the wet spots
5,Great Texture machine,I bought this to texture the sheetrock in my garage. Quickly learned the flow settings and started texturing right away. Had the garage done quickly and for the cost of the gun and premix. Saved me a lot of money. Ready for primer and paint the next day. Highly recommend for the homeowner.
5,Wagner Spray Tech Sprayer,We purchased this sprayer to do our main bathroom in our home and price wise it was great and a whole lot cheaper than getting a sheet rock person to do it. We love the ease of the product.
1,Another Chinese made inferior product,"Shame on Wagner for this poor product. I have never been impressed with Wagner products, but upon recommendation from my local Sherwin Williams dealer, I purchased this product to do popcorn ceilings on my apartment buildings. This purchase was to replace a Homax gun that has served me well for several years but just broke on me. Anyway, this thing is HEAVY! You'll be sweating after 5 minutes of hoisting this thing up in the air. It's messy, leaks, doesn't spray popcorn nearly as well as my old Homax did (and it cost over twice as much), and in my opinion totally NOT worth the money. The little electric air turbine is underpowered for ceilings where you have gravity working against you. Save your $ and get a Homax or Marshalltown if you are spraying popcorn. It might be okay for texture coating, but did I mention it's HEAVY????? For the price charged, I didn't expect to see made in China on the electric air turbine motor! What a pos."
1,Not worth the Money,"As a professional drywaller for over 30 years, I purshased one of these a couple years ago to replace using Homax aerosal for touch-ups. Pretty much a piece of crap. Consistency of texture material has to be just about perfect to spray anything decently. Won't spray if a little to thick or to thin. Won't spray premix sand texture (blows back through hopper). Would be darn near impossible to get a uniform texture. I,ve spent many hours trying different things to make this thing work decent only to be wasting my time. I should note that we have 2 truck mounted texture units with about 30-50 thousand invested in each. If you want good consistency hire a pro with this kind of equipment. Probably half of supposedly pro drywallers only use hopper guns or small equipment.They either don't know what consistent texture is or don't care. Needless to say, we stayed with the Homax aerosal. The Power Tex is now sitting at a local paint store for sale cheap."
1,Junk,"If you're trying to do repair work, this product is not for you. Get yourself an air compressor, hopper, and some sand paper. My first complaint about this product is the fact that air is forced out the nozzle the moment you turn it on regardless of the trigger. This only smears the plaster all over the wall the moment you spray it on. Secondly, the texture it makes is far from being consistent. In short... if you like things done right and care about detail, I recommend you avoid this product and probably anyone like it. If not, then enjoy."
3,Give me my air gun,"As a contractor, I bought this tool hoping that it would save me from having to lug around the air compressor needed for my old texture gun.When I used this tool, it just doesn't have the output of my compressed air unit. It works OK, but if you have a lot of spraying to do, it just takes too long.Now I only use it for quick patching jobs. But even then, it is usually cheaper to buy a can of texture spray and save the labor time of cleaning this tool."
1,dissatisfied,"This is a very poor product. I have been using products like this for over 20 years, I want my money back, Wheres my reciept, and where do i send it?"
4,Wagner Spray Tech 520000 Texture Sprayer Review,This Texture Sprayer worked well. I used it for a knockdown wall finish.It's worth the money for the person who likes to do-it-yourself.It was a simple more cost effective way of applying joint compoundthan an air pressure texture sprayer and compressor setup.
5,Excellent for small jobs,"If you have a small job and you don't want to deal with the air hose, compressor and larger texture gun, this is the ticket. It does a great job with minimum set up time. Pour the texture material in the hopper, plug it in to an electrical outlet and you are ready to go. Clean up is very easy and quick."
5,Wagner Spray Tech 520000,"Delivery was fast. Product well packed. I have already used it twice, once for wall texture and another time for ceiling. It was easy to assemble and use and a breeze to clean. I am very satisfied with the results and I'm glad I purchased this product. It will save me a ton of money in purchasing aeosol texture cans for my rental business repairs."
3,Works ok,I bought this item to touch up a few walls. As far as maching original orange peel texture I couldn't even get close. The consistency of the texture this machine sprays has a lot to be desired. I could never get a consistent pattern to spray out which was real frustrating. On the other hand this thing can save you a lot of money if you don't care if your texture matches correctly or you are texturing a new wall. It is simple to use and easy to clean.
5,Exactly What I Needed!!,Great Product for the Do it your selfer. I used it to do knockdown on all the ceilings in my house. Worked perfectly everytime I used it. Looks professionally done.
1,Saffron Tea,"Not the best tea I used, I will never buy this again, toooooooo expensive. It is simply not worth the cost."
5,THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED!!!,"Dearest interested listener,This CD, ""twenty years, seven months, and twenty-seven days,"" by lynchpin is without a doubt the greatest album ever recorded. It is 11 songs of pure, honest, intense, original, awe-inspiring, epic emo-metal-core. It will redefine your perspective on EVERYTHING. There is no band greater than LYNCHPIN. There is no CD greater than this one, ""twenty years, seven months, and twenty-seven days."" Without question, the gods of music were smiling upon this band. True and sincere emotion sweeps throughout the lyrics and the music, just as the wind fills the mast of a mighty ocean-going vessel. Honest to God, I swear to you, on my dog Virgil's grave, there is no album better than this one. PLEASE, for the love of God, buy this album! It will change your life."
1,DON'T BUY,The DVDs are in poor condition. Could not be worse.There are several episodes in wich you can even watchsuch many problems. If you want to see Xena don't buy.
3,kinda sorta,"There's nothing particularly wrong with the way the box or disks look, but once I tried to play them I found out that some of the DVDs don't work in my blue ray player. My boyfriend thinks they're bootleg, or just really badly made. We eventually found out that there's a 50/50 chance of the DVDs working if we first put a normal DVD into the blue ray player, let it get through the fed warning, and then quickly exchange the normal DVD for the Xena DVD. This can be very annoying."
5,My favorite TV show of ALL TIME! Buy it!,"If you love watching a brave, strong, incredibly gorgeous and sexy woman kick everyone's butt, with her cute sidekick/girlfriend, than Xena: Warrior Princess TV show for you!The production values, storylines (from campy slapstick to dramatic action) Xena Warrior Princess doesn't disappoint and to me is the best TV show EVER made (I am not exaggerating). I loved this series so much I bought 2 copies of the box set.My only complaint is that the DVDs have no closed captioning for the hearing impaired. I have moderate hearing loss and closed captioning would make this set PERFECT."
2,Xena,"I bought the complete DVD collection almost 2 month ago and when I got to watch season four , most of the dvd-s don't work"
5,Learning experience,About the series itself.. There is so much more to it than just some entertaining TV. It has a value for life. Everyones life..The message it carries is huge..Thank you for making this series!
2,Too Christian,"I was an avid Xena viewer when the show came out but forgot why I quit watching it until I purchased this collection. There are some great episodes ""A Day In The Life"", ""The Bitter Suite"" and a couple others. The acting, locations. etc...are great, it's the subject matter which I disdain. Being a mythology lover, I came to wish Xena had aced Gabrielle, killing of the Gods broke my heart and the ""Eli"" factor made me ill."
2,Not able to watch it in it's entirity,What I seen of the DVD's it was great but I wasn't able to watch all of them and the seller hasn't responded to my E-mails.
2,Be careful,"I bought the complete series in memories of my childhood. As I sat down to watch, I found out how bad the discs actually are. I couldn't play the first 4 discs of season 2. Normally Amazon is very good at handling these things. Since it came in a box set they wouldn't replace just season 2. They gave me a partial refund which rebought season 2. Season 5 on every disc had glitches. The discs were without scratches, but had digital issues and freezing problems. I would say I did not get my money's worth and am very unhappy on how Amazon solved the problem. I would never buy a bundle series again knowing that they will not replace the season that is defective."
2,Not new,"I thought it was brand new till I got it, because it was wrapped/covered, I seen fingerprints on the dvds..some worked and some didn't work on dvd player & same with the computer. It's says error. Maybe sure you order it if the format is ""region free"" and read the descriptions because it works anywhere. But I notice this is NTSC format though."
2,Poor quality,Many of the DVD's in this collection appear tarnished and will not play. I have placed them in several different DVDplayers and the result is the same. Again several discs do not play.
4,"The Journey, Not The Destination","If you are a die-hard, this set fills the Xena void quite nicely with some new featurettes, interviews and other extras. However, I was left feeling a little bit empty, since most (if not all) the audio/video commentary by Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor is the same that was found on the season sets. The tiny snapshot this 16-episode set provides is created by the fans, and we all know that no two fans are alike. Therefore I would only recommend this set as a bookend to the full series - because in the case of Xena, what was most important was the journey, not the destination."
1,"Good show, bad DVD","Got this as a gift. I was told the show was great, when the DVD worked. Some of the episodes do not play on some DVDs. So if a disc hs 5 episodes, episode 3 won't play, but the others will. I was very disapointed to hear this."
5,Xena - where have you gone?,"I grew up watching this religiously. I still watch it occasionally when I feel like I need to get away from it all. Yes, it is a bit tacky with silly musicals and sometimes ridiculous story lines, but I absolutely love Xena and Gabrielle."
1,I thought it was the 7th edition,"I thought this was the 7th edition, I looked as hard as I could but couldn't find the edition on it. I was looking at a hard cover 7th edition and this was listed under paperback for the 7th but when I got it it was the 6th edition. The preview showed the 7th too."
5,Desert Critters Camp Out,"Mona Hodgson creates lovable critters that interest children froom 4-7. She takes real desert critters and gives us views of their real lives. She weaves in desert native plant names as well as real places while taking us on another adventure. This time the nocturnal and diurnal critters learn about each other's feeling about the dark and light. They learn to trust their friends to help them enjoy the campout. At the end the book has discussion questions, follow-up information, words written backward and a message from the Bible. All in all, the book is a wonderful adventure for parents as well as children."
4,Love these Pedals,"After purchasing these pedals I attached them to my road bike. Since I will ride about 5,000 miles this year I wanted to try a new pedal. I put the cleats on a pair of my Lake road shoes. The first thing I noticed is the amount of power transfered to the pedals from such a wide base. I noticed right a way a postive difference in my pedaling speed. Since most of my rides are around 50 miles this difference was definatly appreciated.Word of Caution for those graduating from mountain pedals. If you dont get cliped in, forget about it. It wont be pretty. The slick surface of the shoe meeting the slick road platform ensures that you will slip right off of the platform. So be careful."
3,Quick and average,I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this book. I quite enjoyed the story but there was just something missing. I see that it was written in 1997 and so maybe it's just a bit old fashioned but I didn't find the story very exciting. Also I didn't feel the love story between the 2 main characters building up. in fact the H kept insisting that he didn't want to get married up to 80% of the way through the book.
4,i'm lovestruck ?,"why the Q mark there ? Hmm..to begin with, I am a fan of CHARLOTTE L. eversince i knew Harlequin books.. I bought all her books I can pay whenever I see them in bookstores.. One thing that upset me a little is I'm still looking for a couple who can outdone Judith & Luke of INFATUATION and Nicholas and his Lois Lane (I forgot her name !!!) of SCANDALOUS.. Sam and what's-her-name are okay, James and Patience are nice too..but I want more tension,fun and adventure !! Think U can do it for me,Charlotte ?"
2,Force too great; broke 3 out of 8 wires on Cat5e,"Like Hansel, I thought that buying Paladin would be the wiser choice in the long term. I should have been wary given that there were so few reviews on it.I have the punchdown tool on low impact setting. I'm using it to punch Cat5e cables into the keystone jack. It seems that the force is so great that a few wires broke when I punched it in. It caused me a lot of inconvenience just to troubleshoot the fault. I had to test the continuity pin by pin with a meter. I eventually isolated it to the keystone jack, and realized what caused it.I've tested the punchdown tool on 2 brands of keystone jack - monoprice and firefold. For both jacks, at least 2 of the wires would break if I punch it with the low impact setting. My cable is solid, not stranded UTP.Now, I just use this 50 bucks tool to push in the wire."
4,Nice,really is a quality built punch down tool. Only drawback is the length. It is difficult to use in tight places like the back of an equipt rack.
3,Purchased as a present,"Again, this was purchased as a present so can't say if it's good or bad.Category 7: The End of the World"
2,Quality of DVD not to expectation,"While the story is good and well done, the quality of the DVD itself was disappointing. Certainly offered no sharpness as one expects of digital technology. Also the scenes changed suddenly as though the whole thing was done from a Video tape of the production with the advertising cut out.Not good to watch at all. We were expecting the customary quality that one associates with DVD,"
2,World gone crazy... end of the world movie.. sort of.,"Of all the end of the world movie, this is the least convincing. It was actually shown on TV as a 3 night series at one point. It was not convincing then, watching it on DVD was definitely, boring the second time around. Save your money."
1,POOR WATCHING,This is a disappointing low budget movie with unknown actings who have very poor acting skills indeed. I would not recommend it in anyway shape or form. It is so boring u will certainly fall asleep.
3,A great review,The Amazon review by Bret Fetzer is very informative and great fun. I'm very sorry I'm not able to select 'by reviewer'.
1,Category 7: End of the world - should be End the Movie!,This has to be the biggest waste of Blue Ray technology yet. The acting was bad - the visuals were bad - the story was bad - need I say more!
3,quite good for a TV-film,"Global warming is a fashion theme. For me, without hesitation, the best ever in this kind is ""the day after tomorrow"".I give this film 3/5. It's a good score for a tele-film.good: specials effects, personnages-dialog are not borringbad: repetitions, a bit too long and sometime the feeling of watching a cheap production.The reason why I buy this film is Rachel Skarsten :D"
3,CATAGORY 7 JUST A BIT BETTER THAN CATAGORY6,"THIS IS A WATCHABLE MOVIE, BUT NOT QUITE WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR IT. IT IS A LITTLE BETTER THAN CATAGORY 6. SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER, BUT I NOTICED THE SAME SHOTS AS WERE IN CATAGORY 6. THIS KIND OF RUINED IT. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE BETTER, BUT STILL ""CHEESY"" BY TODAY'S STANDARDS LIKE THE NEWEST RELEASE OF KING KONG, WHICH BOASTS SOME AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS. I FEEL TWISTER HAS BETTER SPECIAL EFFECTS AS FAR AS TONADOES GO. THIS MOVIE DOES SHOW BETTER ACTING, AND A LITTLE MORE IN THE LINE OF NOTEWORTHY ACTORS LIKE ROBERT WAGONER, AND RANDY QUAID. IT'S A GOOD MOVIE, BUT FALLS SHORT OF ""THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW"". I'VE SEEN THE PREVIEWS OF REMAKES OF THE CLASSIC DISASTER MOVIES, AND THEY LOOK INTERESTING. THIS MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING, AND IF YOU ARE A DISASTER FLICK FAN, GO FOR IT!!!"
2,The never-ending story...?,"LOL.. When will this ever end...? Category 1, then 2, 3,4,5,6 and now 7..?I wonder what kind of ""super-duper"" storms we will see in Category 8, 9, 10... 34... 98.Well at least they picked a category number for the movie title.. so they can go on for ever. Imagine if they had titles like ""Storm"", ""Super storm"".. ""super-duper storm""... ""zzuper storm"".. ""so strong we dont have a name for it storm"" (I might actually have watched the last one.. lol)"
4,you will be blown away,a great conclusion to catagory 6. it makes us think what if? could something like this happen in our world? would we be ready for it? just too many questions. I enjoyed tornado tommy. he was great. my 8 year old son loves it. he is the big collector of tornado movies. thank you for making this movie available.
1,Save Yourselves - It's Not Too Late,"Unless you have already bought this that is. Even at $9.95 this is a serious waste of your money. Story is pathetic, acting horrible, nothing to recommned this title at all. Take your money elsewhere."
5,Category 7,"Love the DVD... guessing it was made for TV but it certainly made the grade as a great movie that I would reccommend - there are a few moments when the ""low budget"" of the movie show , but overall good"
1,please don't take this movie seriously,"I love a good disaster flick, but this one tasted like a child of Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth perspective. The weather CANNOT be controlled by turning off the electricity, and chunks of the mesosphere DO NOT fall from the sky. If it wasn't so politically charged with the nonsense coming from, sadly, a large chunk of the uneducated population in the world, I might have sat through the entire movie. As it was, I had a good book waiting for me."
4,"Really Cool,I Liked It!","I haven't seen any of the others in this series,butI really enjoyed this one. The special effects are awesome,and I really liked all the storylines,and the characters are well developed.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars,is because it isn't a movie that I would want to watch again,but that is because of my preferrences and so much going on,just seemed too ""over the top"" for me. No offensive elements here either. Definately worth a view."
2,"Typical Disaster movie with your cast of ""Hollywood Has-Beens""","This movie was ridiculous, goofy, funny, stupid and very entertaining. I always like watching other people suffer from phony disasters. It gives me that warm, fuzzy feeling inside; knowing that Hollywood still has a place for run-down, used-up, has-been movie stars like Robert Wagner, Randy Quaid, James Brolin, etc., Then again, if I were out of work and someone asked me to star in a disaster flick - I'd been stomping over the other ""has-beens"" like me, in a minute. It's money in the bank (Shannon Doherty needed it), so can you really fault these ""over-the-hill"" types for taking these roles. No! ""The Storm Of Global Proportions Is Coming"" - The Out of Job Hollywood Actors Are Coming....Let's hope they're acting is not the cause of the End of The World. Hooo-boy."
4,Review: Category 7,"I was slightly disappointed that only one actor was carried over from Category 6. Otherwise I enjoyed the movie, the special effects were fine and the story line worked."
1,The Worst Movie Ever! Don't buy it!!!,"OK. I'm VERY forgiving when it comes to movies. I suspend belief where others criticize. However, I bought the BluRay version of this movie and ended up stopping it just over halfway through. With so many used-to-be stars, you'd think it would be much better. Really, it's embarrassingly bad!Actually, it was so bad, I didn't even keep it. I threw it into the trash without watching the whole thing. This is the first time I've hated a movie so much! I've NEVER thrown away movies! Not even movies I didn't like very much.Don't buy this movie! You'll be wasting your money! If you do buy it, come back on here and share how bad it was so someone like me doesn't buy such garbage again! The average rating for this movie is about six stars higher than it should be, and I have no idea how that happened."
4,Catagory 7 - End Of The World,If you buy this you don't need to buy Catagory 6 - The Day Of Destruction. I have never seen a movie that had so mush of a previous movie incorporated in it as Catagory 7. It was almost like watching Catagory 6 all over again.
2,What? We're through the book already?,"Not a bad science curriculum, but you do the math. 13 lessons total. There are normally about 36 weeks in a typical school year. We tried to stretch it out as long as possible but we've already finished with this book in about 26 weeks....now what do we do for the other 10? Also, most of our projects either didn't work out (stuff died or didn't grow in the hut) or were so (yawn) that we didn't bother to do them. ( I find this to be true with most homeschool science curriculum, frankly.)In northern climates, best to do this one over the spring/summer when there are plenty of materials available and the weather is fav for outdoor exploration."
5,Love it!,"This is a wonderful, colorful text book. We are doing botany for first grade and it is my son's favorite part of the day. Use the accompanying journal to get the must from the book."
2,weak,"I'm sorry, the only song that really works is ""You Can't Sing!"" sung by a guy who can't. The rest is usually competent, but why settle when there is so much better out there?"
1,You have got to be kidding me,"I bought this book to take with me on my vacation for a good beach read. I should have left it at home! Boring, no plot, and the author tries to write from a women's perspective, and it's obvious that he has none. Seriously, Jay, you should stick to your farming."
4,Fun Read,"A funny book. Great for the summer. Light, funny and interesting since there really is a Madeline Island. WI."
3,Interesting story boring video,"The narrator has a great story to tell, which may be true or partly BS. Very articulate and detailed explanations. Interesting if taken at face value. But speaking of ""face"" more than half of the video is a very zoom-in closeup of the narrator talking and talking. It would have been more interesting had there been different camera angles or maybe step back from the camera a few feet. The repetition of the main points was a bit annoying, and could have gone into more detail and less repetition. Primarily photos and not much, if any, film footage. Full-length video is available for free download on the narrator's website."
3,Amazon Verified Purchase,The video was good. Not quite what I expected; I actually got a little bored with it. Perhaps I need to watch it again.
3,One Problem....,"The concept is great and audio quality is fine, but there is one major flaw...the tracks are all a hair too fast. My guess is that this was compiled from videos of PAL film transfers that are 25 fps, as opposed to the correct U.S. speed of 24 fps."
1,This product is not chemical free,If you're buying this product because you think it's chemical free - think again. It actually has more chemicals than other hair dyes found at your local store. Check out [...] to see how safe the products you are using really are. It's rated 8 out of a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most hazardous!
1,Pick the lightest color.,"Before Herbatint, my hair was strawberry blonde w/gray. I bought 7N (light blonde) and used it for 20 minutes rather than the recommended 40. It was at that point that the skin at my hairline started burning. When I looked in the mirror, my hair was a very deep brown. When I dried my hair, it was so dark. I spent the next week washing my hair with dishwashing liquid, different shampoos and even bought a semi-permanent light blonde to lighten my hair. Now, after two weeks of shampooing, my hair is looking more my natural color. I won't be buying this product again. If I could give it a rating of a minus star, I would."
1,bad product,"I bought this product for my mother in a nursing home. I've spent $15 with shipping. First of all it was not light chestnut but dark brown. The worse thing that after two weeks her pillow case became dark brown. Apparently, color started getting out."
5,Best Price for Herbatint,This is my favorite seller. Takes good care of customers and provides speedy delivery. Offers the very best price for this product. I know because I researched it. I am a repeat customer and highly recommend this seller.
4,Great product for those of us who need ammonia-free,"Bought this for the first time on the recommendation of my hairdresser and I really like it! (I can't use regular ammonia hair color b/c of scalp irritation.) Good, long-lasting color, easy to use, and I can get two root touch-ups out of one package. The only complaint I have is that I'm not a fan of the plastic gloves that come with it...but that's true of a lot of store-bought hair color. Unless you have monster hands, you're going to find them too big to be useful. Also, if you get two uses out of it like I do, you're going to need a back-up pair as it only comes with one set. Other than that, great! I'm about to order 2 more packages!"
4,I Like It,"Herbatint is one of the less toxic hair color products available and works pretty well. You may have to experiment to get the right hair color--light chestnut is more like medium to dark brown, and works well on me. The product does not come with a container to mix color and developer; I bought a cheap ketchup like container and use that. (Use hot water and soap to rinse it out at end to reuse.) The bottle is just enough for my thick, past shoulder hair and I use a comb to get the product through all my hair.My scalp does itch a bit while product is on it. Color is good, though--my hairdresser always comments on it. And, it does a great job of covering grey.Does fade a little sooner than I would like. Also, the conditioner that comes with the color works nicely but smells awful--super perfumy--so, unfortunately, I toss it.Recommend.Author, HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT"
5,Good Product,"I love the idea of a hair color product that doesn't have all of the toxic chemicals as the other drug store brands. Now it's not 100% all natural or made from plant leaves and baby's breath or anything like that as someone might mistake it to be. It is simply a safer alternative. It does dye VERY dark which I was going for but the box says to order a few shades lighter of the color you're trying to achieve. If ""Morticia black"" isn't what your going for probably go a shade lighter. Also I have thick hair so I needed two boxes. It does color well and holds up pretty well."
3,Lately takes forever to ship,"I really like this product and I have been buying it here for a long time.However, the last shipment takes forever to process and I had to buy another (cheaper) product from Walgreen's.To my surprise it is better. At half the price, it works better because the consistency is more fluid and it just covers the hair better.The new product has no ammonia, is at half price (regular price, not on sale), is a brand name and I like it more. I can see no negatives a week after I used it.I am not cancelling my order (didn't ship a week after I put it in) but I am switching to the new product."
1,Amazon needs to control their third party shippers,I see there are a number of one star reviews for this product that have everything to do with customer relations and nothing to do with the product. Add me to the list. I have no clue about the speakers as I never received them but I do know Amazon needs to look at what they put their name on when it comes to third party shippers. I got a notice that I had received a refund because I had returned the product. Lies. I never received it. Not sure what the game is but I don't appreceiate my time being wasted.
1,Amazon didn't follow through,"They advertsied this for $128.91 and free shipping. I waited two months for it to arrive. The week it was supposed to be here, I got a delay notice. I accepted and decided to wait. A week later, they cancelled my order. Now the substitution is twice the price of the one I originally ordered."
5,Great and Cheap,This is just what i need. I have a small (13x16) family room. This was the perfect speakers for my needs. At first i was worried...like any man i cranked the base to its highest setting hooked it up to my pioneer 516...turned on the reciever and was ready to blown away. After i replaced my windows i decided to turn it down to 5 (a setting that won't cause heart arrhythmia) After i tweaked the system they sound great...and for $100 i could not ask for more
3,A little weak,"From the reviews online, I expected more from this system. I was scared when I saw how tiny the satellite speakers were, but I kept hearing the reviews in back of my mind. I appreciated the included spool of speaker wire, but I was hoping for a color-coded system. Installation and wall mounting is simple enough, but the true test is powered on... The system does a fair job with movies, but music is not very clean through the subwoofer at all. Overall, this feels cheap compared to others I've heard. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this system to others, and would recommend the low-end Polk set or an Onkyo system."
1,Still haven't received it!,I wish I could tell you these were great speakers....but I've still not received them!
1,Seems like a good product..... But I am waiting forever,"I ordered these speakers in January and I am still waiting!!!! I ve also ordered the Yamaha 5930 AV reciever which arrived promptly but it is practically dusting on the shelf. Amazon has extended my estimated delivery to Feb 23. I would not be surprised if they decide to extend it further.I ll let you guys know when I get them, so you ve a rough estimate of where might be in the queue"
1,SLOW Shipping,"I ordered this at the beginning of December for Christmas, and I'm STILL waiting! The reciever came, but this is getting ridiculus!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I too would like to leave a review for this produce but I still have not recieved it. I bought this system in early December from All American Deals and still have not recieved it. They even advertised it as ""in stock."" Now the system is going for twice what I paid for as well!*Update 5/1/2007 and still without the system I ordered. I'm curious as to what's going to happen now. I'll wait 3 more months before asking for a refund. Stay tuned."
2,Only for those with a severe Need.,"After two hopeless hours of gameplay, the game does not deserve a full review. I wish the cartridge was reusable as digital camera memory!Pros:1) You can customize the door panel graphics of the car.2) You could unlock the Ford GT, maybe if you didn't own a copy of Mario Kart DS and were really bored.Cons:1) No DS Download and play option, only works with other NFS MW owners.2) Graphics under par for the series.3) Gamplay engine is hard to control.4) Customizing is limited and just a repeat of other Need For Speed releases.You have a choice, try some other racing game."
1,Stare Clear,"Check out the review on IGN. The cars have zero texture and the steering is clunky at best. A total travesty. Plus it is from the makers or Marvel Nemisis which is said to be just as bad. The sad thing is that the first NFS game on the DS was not half bad and had EA just tried to enhance that version, they may have had a hit. Instead they switch studios and the result is far inferior to the earlier game. Shame on EA."
3,An OK Read,"This book was interesting but not one that I would recommend to a friend. If you want to learn more about forensic anthropology, this is something you may enjoy. If you want to learn more about the raw emotions that were involved with these situations, this is not the book for you. The author spends more time talking about ""the break down of the team"" vs the grieving mothers who protest the search for their loved ones, familiy members searching through clothes to identify bodies, etc.She prides herself on the fact that she is always smiling, something I found a little off considering the circumstances. There are bloody handprints on the ceiling of a church where hundreds were murdered. It's OK to show some emotion.There are so many books out there that give a great view into what took place within these countries. If that is what you are looking for, I'd move on to something else.This is a good one to get from the library if you are interested."
1,"Shallow, Not Unlike the Graves","Arrogance does not begin to describe the author's perspective toward those with whom she interacts throughout her little adventure. Her insecurity is clearly derived from an inferiority complex - or god forbid a superiority complex - gone awry while working side-by-side with world-renowned experts in the human rights field. As evidenced in her tales, she does not take criticism well, and always blames personality flaws in others while devoid of any self-critique. Her negative portrayal of those she worked with is often shallow, and demonstrates that she learned little to nothing ABOUT her colleagues, while ironically failing to appreciate all that she did learn FROM them. Sorry you had to share a tent, but grow up, Clea; the real story is NOT about you. Your pettiness is a disservice to the victims who, throughout your book, remained buried under that chip on your shoulder."
2,Poorly Written Interesting Content,"I actually borrowed this from the library and thought I should write a review so that people don't waste their money on this one. I usually read 400 page plus books within a matter of 2 weeks. This one is 266 pages and I'm still struggling through it. I'm determined to finish it no matter what - but I have to say that the way it is written makes that really difficult. I was drawn to the book by it's subject matter, however as I go through the pages I feel that Clea focuses entirely too much on her relationship with her team mates and I just get a small glimpse into the lives of the victims she excavates. By the end of each chapter I know more about what she ate that day, the condition of the place she slept in and what the team morale was than I do about the circumstances of the genocide and the victims. In essence it feels more like a personal journal than an informative book about the tragedies in Rwanda, Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo."
2,"Complain, complain, complain","As an earlier reviewer pointed out, _The Bone Woman_ seems to be a journal that was fleshed out (no pun intended) to become a narrative. I found it lacking in several respects. The book was interesting regarding the day to day work of a forensic anthropologist. However, the interminable complaints - about ""management"" versus ""worker"", the press and foreign dignitaries visiting work sites (they are scenes of genocide, for crying out loud!), living conditions, and co-workers in general detracted from the book."
4,The Bone Woman : A Forensic Anthropologist's Search for Trut,"In-depth, touching and comprehensive book. Author deserves the appreciation on writing such a book at such an age. It was quite charming to look her in BBC HardTalk Extra as well."
3,Disappointing but worth reading,"The author had amazing and horrifying rich experiences from which to draw her truth, but it got lost amid a lot of random and irritating other bits. Nevertheless, she describes things that most of us will never have the chance to experience ourselves and we can definitely learn from, so I wholeheartedly agree with the last paragraph of the Laura Secor review printed above: ""less than fully realized..."" ""compelling and worth reading"""
3,David Dramamet,"Through studying David Mamet's theories, I came to realise that a character can be understood not only through what they do, but also through what they say. My style has started to incorporate Mamet's technique of having characters talk, often to each other, as well as to express themselves through physical acts like gestures and walking. The education in this book has convinced me to abandon my earlier style, where characters have wordless internal monologues while not moving for a play's 2 or 3 hour duration.3 stars."
5,review of Mamet's 3 Uses of the Knife,"Excellent text for actors, screenwriters, playwrights or anyone who may want to consider major social issues from a fresh perspective - highly recommended"
3,Interesting Horror Romance,"I didn't actually like this series, only made it through 2 books, though I found the basic plot interesting.An otherwise normal schoolgirl gets visited by Deimos, the devil, and told she's his bride. She tries to get him to leave her alone, but every time she's rude to him he does something horrible. She winds up in the middle of all these sad situations.It's very creepy. It's kind of a romance, I suppose, like that might be where it's going in the end, but I view it as a horror. More like a collection of short stories, because though the girl is in each plot, trying to help the unfortunate hurt/evil person, she can never really do anything and doesn't seem to learn much from the experiences (she keeps trying to ignore Deimos).So I recommend reading the 1st volume, anyway, because it's not a normal manga, and some of the stories make you think (mostly they're just creepy though)."
4,Olympus B01 4PE NI-MH Battery,A must have if you plan to use your digital camera a lot. I've used these rechargeable batteries for a long time with very good results and they provide good value also compared to having to purchase alkaline batteries all the time.
5,"A Modern, Comprehensive, Applications-Oriented Text","The author compiled this 550-page book because there is a real need for users to have a single-source text that clearly illustrates, in hundreds of recent photographs, machines ranging from slow-speed reciprocating to single-shaft, cost-effective, reliable, magnetic bearing-equipped integral-motor centrifugals. It correctly perceives the need to acquaint the modern reliability professional with highly successful 7000 HP multi-stage helical screw machines in dirty gas service and sees fit to highlight such items as leading-edge flexing pivot bearings, dry gas seals, swirl brakes, sophisticated surge avoidance systems, etc. Also included in the text are clear, easy-to-follow examples of performance calculations and graphic shortcut methods for determining upgrade potential and the effects of operating compressors under conditions that deviate from those originally specified."
5,Practical Indeed,"As a young compressor engineer, I need every advantage I can get and this book delivers with loads of information on all types of compressors. Very helpful for gaining a broad spectrum of technical compressor knowledge."
5,Simply wonderful!,This picture book is simply wonderful! I wish I had thought to take pictures like Mrs. Chao during the aftermath of September 11th. So many memories flooded back. I was full of patriotism and American pride when I finally finished paging through the book at 3 o'clock in the morning! Thanks so much for your inspirational pictures!
3,Excerpts from the Prose Edda,"While Young's translations are quite good, it should be noted that these are *selections* from the Prose Edda, and are not complete. Notably missing are large sections of Skaldskarpamal, or ""Poetic Diction"". This is a good edition if you just want the mythological stories, but having the complete Prose Edda is even better -- there are a lot of kennings and other details of the poetry that shed further light on the mythology.Fortunately, there is a good, complete, and inexpensive translation available, and Amazon also carries it -- the Anthony Faulkes translation."
5,Every page taught me more and more.,"I read this text while at university, and in the years since it is never far from my mind. I recommend it to anyone interested in literature, myth, language, or just exhibits an enquiring mind. What intrigued me the most was the skaldic verse form. To my mind it is the most complicated and creative form I have ever witnessed. Without this book, so much about Scandinavian mythology would have been lost to us forever. Snorri Sturlusson was certainly a special man, with a great gift and a proud endevour. Through his work, his ancestors are still breathing, and waiting in Valhalla."
3,Not the best translation available,Although a decent translation of Snorri's Prose Edda; it lacks the depth of the Faulkes' translation. Young only translated two of the three books of the Prose Edda; the Gylfagining and the Skaldscarpismal. Of all the translations of the Prose Edda only Faulks translates all three books and all three have important lore required by the earnest seeker of the lore of the Northern European peoples.
3,Poor Louis!,First Kenny G and now this weak collection. That sound you hear in the Big Easy is Louis rolling over.
4,A Little Brief but Still Quite Good Representation,"If you are looking for a basic sample of this lengendary trumpet players work, you have it right here. Blueberry Hill, Hello Dolly, Gone Fishing, and more all brighten up this disc. Anyone listening to this disc, can see that Louis was a legendary trumpet player and a fine vocalist in his own special way. Somes a gravely vocal style can be quite endearing. One could probably search out one of the larger sets if one wants more Louis, but as an intro this collection is quite good."
1,cliff double cd,"I was told in the advert that the cd cover was a little damaged. This did not make a difference as I was more interested in the sound quality. The cd came cover in excellent quality, but several of the tracks skipped."
5,Jessica Mc Clintock,"Jessica Mc Clintock is my favorite perfume. I absolutely love all of the products. I have always purchased Jessica in department stores, and this was almost too good to be true that I could purchase them on Amazon.com. I am so happy with the body powder. It's a nice size and will last a long time. It's such a silky body powder. My body feels so smooth and I don't perspire. The product is top of the line for me."
4,my favorite perfume.. now my favorite powder,"This powder is nice. Silky and smells great. Love this after a shower and layers well with the perfume. If you like the perfume, you will like the powder."
3,Just OK - Might be worth 10 bucks max.,"There really isn't much here related to singing, the content is mainly concerned with keeping your voice in shape physically and stressing the importance of warming up and such. One negative on the format is there are 2 chapters with several lessons each. From what I can see there is no way to play them in a continuous manner. The lesson ends and the DVD returns to the menu so you have to navigate to the lesson you want and press ""Play"" again. As some of the lessons are very short this gets pretty annoying."
4,Not Too Necesary,"I'm going to give this maybe 4 stars only because I think this guy is awesome, but this video is non-essential. If you can get it cheap, then go ahead. However, this DVD (although I got the VHS version) doesn't really help out too much. It's formatted with some cheesy acting (like blonde bimbos in those low-budget steakhouse commercials) and old effects. Truthfully, the few topics discussed in this video are more along the lines equivalent to ""skeleton notes"" of his corresponding book, The Rock N Roll Singer's Survival Manual. I haven't read it in full yet, but I think I should start soon! All Mark really does for this is visually show you a few concepts in the book, but don't expect to repair mirrors with your voice after watching this. It's alright. Just thought I'd give you a new perspective."
3,Dissapointed,Did not have all of the songs in the soundtrack. Especially the ones that I favored. Tried to return it and was denied.
5,Serving as Senders,Serving as Senders is an excellent eye opener for supporting missionaries. Every missions committee member and senior pastor needs to read this book. It is very practical and motivating.
1,Not a book for anyone interested in Traditional Archery,I was very disapointed in this book. If you are interested in Traditional Archery (Longbows & Recurves with real wood arrows) stay away from this book. It is very dirogitory to the Native American and Primative sytles of archery. I give it 1 star only because the scale won't go lower!!
4,Not Impressed,"I agree with another post that this book is primarily written for a summer camp counselor who is in charge of the archery course! I was probably dissapointed because I read this after reading the revised edition of Dr. Kidwell's book Instinctive Archery Insights. That book enlightened me, and helped my shooting, in ways I could never have imagined! This book, Archery: Steps to Success is pretty basic. If that is what you are looking for I guess it's OK."
1,There are much better books available,"This book is geared for beginners, but is really lacking. Line drawings are no substitute for decent pictures. Many of the explanations are so basic that they don't really give you any information at all. There is nothing in this book that can't be found somewhere else, such as the internet for free. I believe that anyone starting in archery would be much happier with some of the other books available."
2,One of the Largest collections of songs from Shirleys movies,"Even though ""Stand Up and Cheer"" has 60 songs on 3 CDs, the two volume ""America's Sweetheart"" compilation actually has 19 songs that are NOT in this box set...But since there are NO box sets containing ALL of the music from ALL of Shirley's films. This one seems like a good place to start, unless, of course you care about quality. See Gary's review for that...Tracks on ""America's Sweetheart"" that are NOT on ""Stand Up and Cheer""...Volume One: 2, 5, 9, 13, 17, 19, 23, 24, 25Volume Two: 5, 11, 12, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26"
4,Sikh Next Door,It is well done. Should consider adding the history of Sikhs in America since 1899. It will enhance education for students and the teacher
2,3COM USB NIC for Win98,"I received my 3COM USB NIC from Amazon.... and attempted to install it on a Compaq Pentium III running Win2000 and realized that on the 3Com package, it clearly states that the device is ""USB for Win98"" (a fact not specified on Amazon.com). 3Com's website does not contain drivers to download for W2K, so I am having to return the item. If you are running Windows 2000, be careful. I called 3COM for tech support (a long distance call) but hung up after 5 minutes of hold time."
2,"10Mbps, not Windows 2000 compatible.","It's not to say that it won't work, and that it won't work for you, but I think it was a poor product release by 3com, who makes many of the best networking devices out there. The 10Mbps only limits your connectivity option wether or not you NEED the speed or not. For instance, you might have a 100Mbps only hub, or a 10Mbps device might make your 100Mbps segment less efficient. Also, this device is not Windows 2000 compliant which makes it useless in my organization. If you run Windows 98, and are a home user, it will likely work for you, but I think the 10/100 Linksys product is superior and is less expensive."
4,Excellent,"This is a great book for the wordsmiths. If you love words, you will love this book. It tells you how many ways you can fashion words into your narrative, and some of the things you've been told you shouldn't do, you are going to learn are perfectly all right. If this book doesn't help you come off writing like a poet, nothing will."
3,was this version necessary?,"Sorry, anytime I see a bunch of demo and live tracks it looks like filler to me.Go hunt down the 1995 Japanese import of same that gives you the Love Bites album, Parts 1-3 singles and ""I Look Alone."" Now that one punks out to the max rather than the extra tracks here which are basically already available on Singles Going Steady."
4,free electric band a great album,"I don't know why this album gets so little attention. In my youth I loved this album, and have had Free Electric Band on casette for many, many years up until the present time. I've often scanned Amazon for this album, and reviews but to no avail until I spotted this. Every song on FEB is a winner - I can't speak for Southern California,and to be frank have never particularly gotten into any of Albert Hammond's music other than FEB. The title track is a fantastic number, and many of the others, though a bit pop-orientated for my current taste, hold up well and are very tuneful and listenable.One only ever sees compilations of Hammond, but I rate FEB has better than any compilation."
2,playability,so far I haven't been able to get it to play on any of my CD players. Haven't figured out why yet.
3,defective warning,Overall it was a good kit. The case wasn't the best design I've seen but it fit and all of the tools worked reasonably well. The Crimper (main reason I got this) was excellent and did everything I wanted it to.I ended up returning the kit because the RJ-45 Patch Check tool was defective.
4,A good resource,other reviewers here give good overall information - I just want to add that Grenz asserts the amillennial position so readers will be aware of what to expect.
5,"Fair, respectful, and just plain awesome.","Grenz took a bunch of books that would take too long for us to read and combined them into one amazing book that can give us the bigger picture in 215 pages of awesomeness.After reading Millenial Maze, you'll be more knowledgeable about the delicate topic of the Millenium/end of the world than 99% of the Christian community. All the juicy stuff is here: Israel, the Rapture, hermeneutics, arguments and counter-arguments, George Eldon Ladd, and the underlying worldviews embedded in each millenial scenario.Grenz is surprisingly fair with an already controversial topic that's all to easy to let personal biases creep in. He respects the different views on the Millenium without a hint of arrogance.As a reader, you can read this book knowing that his agenda is to adequately inform you of the different perspectives, show their significance to the body of Christ, and help you to see our present in the light of God's future."
2,...,"I definitely got an older edition than what I ordered. However, it worked for what I needed it for. I just needed it for class so I took what I could get. So far the book is interesting... I'm not finished yet."
4,How new is this product,would like to know how new is this product. Does it have any scratches when u say its refurbished. What are the accessories that come with this prodcut. Basically how new does it looks.
3,Good instant on computer,"I bought this to replace my older Jornada 680e since it has a faster processor and an updated operating system (although it is almost a decade old). It does everything the older Jornada 680e does, and it can play MP3 music too. The sound is teeny and has too much treble. If I was going to use it to take notes only, I would give it a 5 star for the battery life and instant on operating system. But since I bought it to do other things besides taking notes, it does not do them too well. Remember that the keyboard is very small; so if you have big or fat fingers, you will not be able to touch type on this unit. But if you have small hands, you can type as fast as a full size keyboard, a big plus."
2,Uses battery rapidly,It uses main battery rapidly. I have tried many batteries and the symptom was the same: the battery indicator went down fast (much worse performance than that of Jornada 720). Sent it back for repair. After I got it back nothing has changed. I would recommend Jornada 720 even despite of less RAM (it also looks better).
5,A classic old book has been brought back into print!,"This is a fascinating book that goes into great detail on cheating methods for many gambling games including slot machines, poker, roulette and craps. There are also discussions of three-card Monte, cheating devices, carnival games, counterfeiting, pool, horse racing, and ""miscellaneous schemes and frauds."" Protection is rich in visuals, including slot machine schematics and reprints of old news stories about cheating. It's a great reference work!"
4,Baseball with a little mystery,"Safe At Home is a nice light read IF you don't mind figuring out who the bad guy is 200 pages before our heroine. Gordon is an excellent author who writes very authoritatively about baseball and sportswriting. If she ever gets the hang of suspense, watch out."
1,a little awkward,I understand that this book is still being widely sold in LDS and Christian bookstores. The book's point of view is that homosexuality is something that can be overcome.It's interesting to note that each of the book's co-authors has subsequently come out as gay and lesbian respectively. This makes their theories ring more than a little bit hollow.
1,bent after a few uses,"was using it on my ar and after about 4 pushes, it bent at one of the joints.Switch to a coated wire pull through type and that worked way better."
4,Warren Sr.'s band provides a gem for trad-jazz lovers,"This is Warren Vache Sr. again, the bassist (not to be confused with his son, Warren Vache the trumpeter/cornetist). It's the band's second recording, but their first on the Jazzology label. If you like traditional jazz, you'll like this. It's that simple. There's some fine playing here, absolutely. Nothing really wrong with it. So why didn't I give it five stars instead of four?? Because there's a wee bit of oomph or something else I can't put my finger on missing that just doesn't take it all the way up to the Louis Armstrong or Sidney Bechet level. On the bright side, there's a very slowed-down, bluesy take of Jada, the likes of which I've never heard before for that tune. It's a nice surprise on an otherwise really good but ever-so-slightly predictable album. Enjoy."
5,GREAT CHARGER,"Lost my charger to my olympus 720SW, new one from Olympus was $65, after markerts where $49 at Wal-mart and radio shack.Found this one, great price and works even better.Thanks,EH"
5,Works Great...Charges the Battery just fine,While on vacation I lost my OEM camera battery charger and decided to buy this one as a replacement. It works as good as the original for a very substantial cost savings.If you need one..just buy it. It works great.
4,Great Charger for My Camera Battery!,"I love this battery charger. It always works perfectly fine, no cables to deal with and its easy. I lost the original charger for my camera and had to buy a new one and this has been a great replacement. I definately recommend it."
3,A Classic,"This is a classic look at English language structures that can be very useful for anyone teaching English to speakers of other languages. While the ""habit formation"" psychology of audio lingual method has been eclipsed by more cognitive approaches, it is still very likely that English speakers regularly use and reuse a definable body of structures. This group of patterns is very large, but it is finite. Chomsky did us a disfavor when he said that all language is infinitely creative. Theoretically, yes, but given that we don't invent whole new structures every time we speak or write, it may be useful to introduce language learners to the ones that occur most frequently. This book is a veritable catalog of the most frequently used sentence patterns of English, and very useful to the teacher trying to offer their students immediately useful target language."
3,as it was showed,"i received the product on time, in good conditions, as it was supposed to be according to the seller, so i cant complain."
2,Better saved for children.,"You think Chuck, and automatically you assume tough guy and beating people up or blowing people up...sadly, this is not the case here. This movie, I believe, was made for children. The only cool things I can recall are Chuck morphing into animals and at one point from a bird to a jump-kick. Hardcore Chuck fans should stick to the early MIAs and Delta Forces. However, if you want to introduce Chuck to your children, this is a great way, as it has extremely mild violence, no swearing that I can recall, and I do not recall seeing any blood."
1,Dosent even deserve 1 star,"Without a doubt one of the most pathetic films ever made. Extreamly bad acting, Stupid camera angles, Most of the time you cant tell what is happening. The transforming from animals to humans vice vera is the worst effect ever, Basicly you see a bird flying and in the next shot (About a second after) the hairy chuck norris is standing there. Punches look so fake its amazing, Incredibly bad directing makes it look like a 9 year old could of done better if he went into the woods with a cam-corder and some pals. The budget is obvisly tighter than an italien waiters trousers and the only reason chuck norris is in the movie is beocouse the film was made by his brother aron nossis! I really really, really really recomend not buying this film."
4,personal opinion,This movie was geared towards The People's Spiritualty regarding Mother Earth and that life consists of a circle. I plan on purchasing this movie but only when it becomes available in dvd format.
5,THRASH IMPACT IS IMMINENT !!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!! This is my favorite EXODUS album, and i gotta say one of the BEST THRASH albuns EVER!!!!!! while i totally like PLEASURES OF THE FLESH and FABULOUS DISASTER, IMPACT IS IMMINENT got the coolest RIFFS and the best vocals from the great STEVE SOUZA!!!!! Steve[s voice is AMAZING, it[s like a THRASH INSANE PUNK Bon Scott.....a, the legendary H team guitar duo is one of THE BEST!!!!!! GREAT GREAT album....the Mlps package is lame....well, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, EXODUS!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Impact is Imminent,"Happy with product.CD did not come in jewell case,just cardboard.Would have been happier with jewell case."
4,satisfying,"i did not know it would arrive in a digipack!!!!i thought a hard cover like i always recieve cds from you guysdigipacks are supposed to be for items not for sale (destributed for free)and the lyrics on the back of the fragile cover are too small i cant read them, noone can!!please don't sell me cds in digipacks again pleasssecd quality is very goodregards;Dima"
5,By Far,By far one of the best CD's I have ever heard or owned. You need to have this album in your collection!
1,Shockingly Bad Performance,"Not only do these batteries not last more than a couple of years (at very low utilization and certainly fewer than two dozen recharges since purchase), they also don't hold their charge for more than a couple of weeks after being recharged when they are a year old or more. I cycle through about a dozen of them for my mouse and keyboard, but when I replace the current pair with some others that I've previously charged, no more than a couple days goes by when I have to replace them again, it is pathetic.Buy Sanyo Eneloop instead, I have one of those to yet fail on me, and they are always ready to go when I need them, they actually hold a charge for more than two weeks."
5,Charged up,Not only was the price good but the product arrived quickly. Primarily use these batteries for wireless accessories and a digital camera and they hold their charge for a long time. Have increased usage time in comparison to regular over the ocunter batteries. Would highly recommend to anyone who may be considering rechargeable as an option.
4,Brand name rechargables,"These are Energizer brand rechargeables. I can't really speak to their quality compared to other brands - as this is the only brand I've purchased recently. I generally use these in remote controls, wireless mice, keyboards, etc. I feel much better about popping a newly charged battery into one of these rather than a whole new battery.They don't seem to last as long as conventional batteries - I certainly wouldn't put them in your smoke detector, but for frequently used items such as those I listed above, they are nice.I went with a brand name and a product that was priced competitively. When it comes time to buy some more, I won't necessarily buy the Energizer again - I'll probably read the reviews and buy the least expensive one out there with decent reviews. YMMV."
3,OK,Batteries received in good condition. They seem to not be very strong and long lasting as other rechargeable batteries. Good cheap option.
2,Cannot recommend since they do not hold charge very well,"I use rechargeable batteries for everything and I use mostly Eneloops and Amazon Basics which are good. They hold a charge well and I have recharged them many times. I did want to write a review though about these Energizer Rechargeable batteries because we can only buy Energizers at my workplace. These batteries do not hold a charge very well. Out of the 8 batteries only 3 hold a charge well, the other 5 die literally after minimal use. I use a Lacrosse battery charger and I know the bad batteries are supposedly ""full"". I have also purchased the AAA versions of these batteries and have encountered the same problem. I know Energizer makes some great products but I would not recommend their rechargeable batteries. I would stick with Eneloops or the Amazon Basics."
5,They should update the photo,"I just bought this before I found it says 1200mAh in the photo. But what I got are 2500mAh ones! I've teared the pack, otherwise I would have uploaded an image..."
1,Energizers don't stay energized for long!,I recently bought an Energizer NiMH battery charger for my Olympus D460Z digital camera and found that I have to recharge these batteries every 3-4 days. I did notice that these batteries are power rated at 1200 mAH. I know the ones made by Kodak are rated at 1450 mAH and the ones by Olympus are 1600 mAH and they both cost the same price ... . I'm gonna try the Olympus ones.
2,50% Failure Rate -- But They Reimbursed Me,"I've had good luck with other brands of rechargeable batteries before, but these by Energizer are a huge disappointment. I've had a set of four for just a year or so and to my surprise, two of the four have failed. There are no leaks and no apparent damage, yet these batteries will no longer charge and even after a full charge cycle, the power output is not even sufficient to power my flash. Checking them with a battery tester indicates the power level at just half the level of a full charge, rendering these defective batteries useless.I should mention that I advised Energizer via a cordial message. Assuming it's rare for relatively new batteries to fail, I provided the manufacturing lot identifier and offered to send the batteries to them for testing. But, no, they didn't ask for the batteries. However, they sent me an Energizer battery coupon that was valued at roughly the cost of my two prematurely failed batteries."
1,Not even close to professional grade,"Another example from the ""Age of Crappy"". Price can be the only excuse for Energizer's continued existence.That advertised 2500 mah capacity scarcely lasts an hour out of the charger.If you really need a WORKING NiMH rechargeable, buy Sanyo Eneloops. For a couple of bucks more you get a product with an order of magnitude better performance."
1,Doesn't hold a charge,"The batteries worked well for maybe a month. After that, they only held a charge long enough to power my bluetooth mouse for about a week.Cheep Walgreens batteries last about 10X as long, so that is what I'm using now until my eneloop batteries arrive (which have a 4.5/5 rating, so I hope they're better)."
2,"Old technology, never really performed","I had high hopes, but my wife complains about them all the time. She wants to toss the camera, but I now switched to newer technology batteries and it works now.They would not hold a charge while shelved and just never performed well.Buy the newer technology batteries that hold a shelved charge for a year of more.Not recommend."
1,Rapid discharge after full charge just sitting on shelf,"After a full charge and just storing them on the shelf, not installed, the batteries fully discharge after two weeks. I do not have this problem with Sony or Sanyo batteries. The Energizer batteries are the made in Japan versions. Save your cash and buy a different brand."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy. I don't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables. I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs. Needless to say, most don't work after a year. I couldn't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger. And today, my sons batteries died in his guitar, took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they didn't even last five minutes, and boy he wasn't very happy. I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store. Look for a better brand!"
1,Does not hold a charge,"I bought 8 of these, and they are utterly worthless for my needs. I'll charge the batteries for my digicam and GPS and they'll work fine that day. I used them 4 at a time in my camera and 2 at a time in my GPS. I did try switching them around to make sure it wasn't a problem with a battery or two, they all did the same thing. If I leave the equipment off for the day the batteries are dead the next time I try to turn the equipment on. I might as well just plug my equipment in, these batteries are not worth the cost.For what it's worth, the 2200 mAh Energizer batteries have been much better--they actually hold a charge."
4,Didn't last as long as I hoped,I used these batteries for my wireless mouse and gaming controllers.These batteries did not last as long as the usual AA batteries I had so I had to buy more of these to make up for itPros:Saved me money in the endCons:Didn't last as long as normal AACost me more upfront
2,Batteries are poor,"I used these batteries for my digital camera and was only able to take 3 to 4 photos before batteries died. However, I bought some different rechargable batteries and the charger worked fine on these.....so the charger works well."
3,What more do you expect from batteries?,"They are good batteries, very nice, nothing extrodinary, nothing bad. Get them if you need."
2,"Good at first, but stopped working sooner than Duracell","I purchased 2 sets of 4 Energizer 2500mAh rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. They all worked fine for a few months, but then I started having trouble with them. They were not holding a charge for as long as they did before in my digital camera (which I use frequently - 3 to 5 times per week). They seemed to go downhill rapidly. From the time I started having trouble to the time they were completely useless was only a couple of weeks. I have purchased many Duracell rechargeables (of various types) and have not had this experience with them."
2,Horrible,Either my battery recharger doesn't like these batteries (it seems to like other) or these batteries are horrible and can't hold a charge.
1,Good for a few months,"I specifically searched the web looking for issues with these batteries. They are great at first, but after a few months of using them, they just don't last.I have had the same issue with 2 different batches of them. I was starting to think it was the charger, but they only happened to the Energizers, and not to the generic NiMHs with a 2200 mAH capacity, that I've had longer than these Energizers that are still going strongEnergizer's goal was apparently to get the highest mAh number, at the cost of durability. Their website even cites half the number of cycles these 2500s have over the older 1700s...but I'm not getting anywhere near the 500 they say..more like 20 (to be generous)"
2,Dead after a week,I have to charge the batteries immediately before using them in my digital camera. Even if they lay around for a few days after being fully charged they will not power my digital camera. I guess I am going to the Sanyo Eneloop batteries.
5,always bought energizer,"The product was as shipped but in a crappy little envelope with no padding so the battery package opened a little but the batteries still work, no problems with them."
5,"Saves Money, Performs As Advertised",I was initially skeptical about the quality and duration of rechargeable batteries but no longer. I purchased 2 chargers which came with 2AA energizer rechargeable batteries. I have used the same 2 sets for well over a year and they have been recharged many dozens of times. There seems to be no appreciable decrease in power and I find them especially useful for the computer keyboard and mouse as well as high drain toys. The money saved has been significant and I will never go back to regular alkaline batteries again. Highly recommended.
1,Junk!!!,"I bought the Energizer rechargeable batteries for my little Sony transistor radio, which uses four AA batteries. Walgreen's alkaline batteries give me several weeks of excellent performance. When I'm lucky, I get about two days between charges of the Energizer batteries. Even if one saves money in the long run (which I doubt), they really aren't worth the bother. These are junk!"
1,These are the worst!,These batteries do not hold a charge. I have missed so many opportunities for amazing pictures because I've had to stop to switch out my batteries. I will not be purchasing these ever again.
3,Not what was pictured...,"The batteries that showed up in the package work fine and I am reasonably happy with the price.The problem I have is that the batteries in the majority of the pictures on amazon were 2500 mah (milliamp-hours) the batteries that I got are 2300 mah. I think that this is a major oversight on amazon's part, but not severe enough for me to return them."
2,Inconforme con el producto,"El producto enviado no era el publicado, es decir, la publicaciòn ofrecen baterias 2500mah y las que recibi eran de 2300mah. Estoy inconforme."
2,Mr,Only two of these batteries can still be recharged after only a few recharges.I can only hope the others last longer.
2,Doesn't hold the charge after a year of use,Usually my rechargeable batteries last longer the year before I need to buy a new set. Not this time. Maybe I just got a bad batch
2,Subject to catastrophic failure,"Currently I have five of these cells from the original dozen that I purchased. The failure mode for the seven discarded units has been the same in each case - complete and sudden failure of terminal voltage. Loading a piece of equipment with a complement of freshly charged Energizer NH15BP cells is no guarantee that the device will work an hour later when needed. DO NOT LEAVE HOME WITHOUT A SPARE SET OF THESE CELLS IN YOUR POCKET!In the approximately the same period that has seen seven out of 12 Energizer failures, the count has been zero for eight for Sony cells and one out of eight for Kodak units. This, in spite of the fact that the Energizer cells have increasingly been relegated to ""spares"" and haven't actually seen much real use in the last year or two.The Energizer cells were NOT from a single batch but were purchased four at a time over several months and even show some design differences in sealant colors etc. among the batches. Definitely off my buy list."
1,Terrible discharge rate,These batteries flat out do not hold a charge. We are lucky to have them last a couple of days on a fresh charge before dying out.Update: I complained to Energizer about the problem and their customer service was very helpful. They made reasonable efforts to make good on this issue.
1,Good Capacity/Bad Charge Retention,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands, I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries. I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience, as it depends what you use them for, but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use. They're nearly worthless to me. I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year, so hopefully those will work as promised. I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these. Try another brand."
1,Warning! High discharge rate,"After replacing my old Sony rechargeable batteries after 3 years of solid use, I wanted to go in another direction and bought these from a supposed battery-specialized company. At first I thought the reason why, after charging the batteries a couple days before, the first pair was at mid charge while the spare batteries could not even turn my camera on, was due to using a Sony charger. After that I bought an Energizer charger with another four batteries.Guess what? the same thing. The only way you can use these is if you charge them right before use (8 hours!) and practically makes no sense carrying a spare pair as they will not work when you need them.I really recommend avoiding these and going with Sanyo Eneloops, just as I did."
1,Discharge very fast,"Be careful. If you plan to charge and use these immediately, they're OK. If you plan to leave them on the shelf for a couple of weeks...they will be dead. Problem gets worse after about 6 months. High capacity is useless. My Rayovac's (1800 mAH) are much more useful."
1,"Buy the lithium batteries,","The Energizer bunny crapped a big turd when he made these batteries. I bought these batteries to put in my digital camera and my wireless optical mouse. After the initial charge, I put these in my Canon 540 Sure Shot digital camera and I didn't even take three pictures and they were dead.The set that I put in the mouse didn't fare any better either. I will say that the second charging did better in the camera, but the optimal mouse eats them like candy. They won't last more than a day in my mouse, and that is after the third charging now.Save your money. I recommend you purchase the lithium batteries more than these. Even the regular Energizer batteries last longer in the mouse than these rechargable ones do. Someone else might get better use out of them, but I sure didn't."
1,"Inconsistent capacity, only can achieve 50% claimed capacity","I give it a 1 star because there is no 0 star or neg.I bought 3 packs(12 batteries total) from Amazon. After refreshing and testing, only 6 batteries exceed 2200 mAh, 4 range from 2200-2400, 2 are at 2600.However, there are 6 batteries' tested capacity below 1300 mAh(1120-1300).Yes, you read it right, 6 are only at 50% of claimed capacity. I am returning mine."
1,"awful experience and totally cheating, i didn't expect that from amazon","it's really my first bad experience with amazon. the package is not like the picture in the ad.it's not written 250 times charging but what i got is just normal weak batteries. also, the package is really old and there was tear on one side.it's really disappointing cause i always told my friends that amazon is better and trusted. and i wasted a good chance to get better batteries and cheaper cause i trusted amazon.i can't even return it cause i'm leaving in 10 days.may i ask who bought commented on that item (did you really get it as expected and as they show it in amazon? because i trusted your comments) you know if ur not honest in ur comments it comes back to u away or another. i do hate cheating."
1,bad seller,"the description for the batteries were 2500 mAh but they wasn't what i received .. they were 2300 mAhwhen i send them to tell them that i wanted the 2500 like the description , they said sorry but it didn't say that anywhere .i had to copy a picture of the description and send it to them so that they believe me after not reply for a couple of weeks and me sending again they made me a refund"
2,"Great product, short life","I bought these for my Canon digital camera (A710-IS) and was immediately disappointed to find out they did not support both 110V and 240V input voltage. To counter this, I immediately bought some Sony batteries with the same specs that did have a 110-240V charger. I used these 2 sets of batteries through many trips.After 2 years, the Energizer batteries simply stopped working. They would hold a charge for maybe a few days then be dead, even with no use. The Sony batteries are still lasting for hundreds of photographs with each charge.I would not recommend these batteries simply because you'll need new ones within 2 years. Buy some Sony ones instead."
4,Good Rechargeable battery,"Overall works very well. Holds charge well. Gets 20 or so full recharge/drain cycles before starting to taper off on holding a charge. 30 or so is the limit. However, that's not a bad return on investment."
1,Dead,I have a whole bunch of these along with a lot of other rechargeable batteries and these ones are the worst by far. They only work for about 15 minutes now and then die. It's takes probably a year to get to this point. I could have saved money by buying regular batteries for the amount of use I've gotten out of these.
1,Don't waste your money,"As others have said, these batteries do not hold a charge at all. I have 20~ of these that I mostly use in Wii and Xbox 360 controllers, with 6-8 to spare for when one set goes dead. They're always charged as soon as they're taken out and then put back in a case with the other reserves. Often times it might be 3-4 weeks before I have to change some out, and at least 1/2 of the time the replacements are already dead.I have 4 Sony batteries in the mix, and as another poster has mentioned, I've also noticed that they seem to hold their charge much better."
1,Total Junk,Ok i bought these online 8 total..compared to my 1 year old rayovac rechargeable batteries these last half as much or less. i duno maybe they are bad batch or just junk..do not buy these..look else where/different brand
3,2450 mAh Instead of 2500 mAh,The batteries came within a few days.However the mAh rating was 2450 mAh instead of 2500 mAh as shown in the ad.
1,Brech phooey,"Don't hold a charge, don't recharge well compared to other brands I have. Worst, all are long term more expensive than disposables. Brech-phooey. Wish the manufacturers would improve this product. I like recharging as contrasted with using and tossing."
2,"Pictures lied, not 2500 mAh","I got the batteries in and noticed that they where not 2500 mAh, instead they are 2300 mAh. For a normal person this would not make any difference, but since I use them in off Camera Flashes, this affects the performance. I get less flash fires with these than with the 2500. I'm not giving it a lower star just because I CAN use them, but will not give it more because they are NOT the ones I require."
1,Disappointed,"I had hoped that the battery companies had finally gotten it right. I decided to spend the extra money on the rechargeables and was incredibly disappointed. Sure they were great the first 3-4 times I used them. But, now, when I recharged them for 6th or 7th time, they can't even get a simeple LED light bright. These are pathetic. Not worth the money."
2,To high self discharge rate,"As with a number of other reviews, my experence with these batterys was disappointing. They worked fine at first, but even when new, I noticed that they would be dead after a month or so. But as I continued to use the batterys, this problem got progressivly worse. By the time the batterys had about 30 charge cycles, afully charged set barly lasted a week sitting unused.If I have a planned shoot with my camera (a Canon powershot a530) the batters still work ok charging them the night before the shoot. But if the camera has been sitting around a cuple of weeks and I want to take some spur of the moment photos, I keep some disposable lithium batterys on hand. I also take the disposable lithiums as backups when I am out shooting.I am going to serch for a different brand of rechargables after my experence with these!!"
4,Everready 2.5ah rechargeable batteries,I have been using these batteries in a golf GPS. Prior to these batteries I would not get 36 holes (2 rounds). Mow I am getting 72 holes (4 rounds) with charge to spare.
4,Rechareable Batteries,"I have purchased these Energizer batteries before. They seem to work fine, butwhen they are ""dying"" permanently - you won't know this until the charger shows it cannot charge the batteries. Somehow there should be a ""life"" message so that you know it is time to order more batteries!"
1,self discharge over night to 0mah,"I bought this from Walmart for around $10 Bucks.First thing discharge and refresh from BC700 took over a day to get it fully back to it's life which is 1.4v 2400mah= super awesome.Put it into my Vivitar 285 and it's gave me a good 200+ shot at full power= another super awesome.Then fully charge it to 100% again and left it overnight, by the next morning it's completely discharge by itself to 0mah WTF? Ok maybe i left it out next to my TV? how about charge it to 100% again and leave it into my drawer? how about put it into battery case and then into the drawer?Well 0mah again by the next day. Will return this to Energizer.i should spend my hard earn money to some Sanyo Eneloop.Stay away from Energizer Recharge."
2,Buy Sony,This battery did not charge well even on its first day and do not hold charge long in standby. The Sony battery/charger combo I purchased was a much better investment. Don't waste your money on Energizer product.
4,Extra 4 pack.,I recommend having another 4 batteries and the recharger came with 4 and we needed more to have some to use while the others are charging.
5,powerful battery,i like my batteries and i got it with no interruptions. i like itu should guys buy some batteries.
4,Work as expected,"I am using rechargeable batteries most of my life (am from overseas), so I will do even over here where most is wasted.My 10 year old rechargeable batteries finally died, I bought Duracell ones first, they lasted 3 months, got replacements from factory, lasted less then 6 months.Then switched to Energizer ones. They seem to work fine. Don't have the full capacity as advertised but close (not 2,450 mAh, rather 2,122 mAh).Tried to format them with my computer charger (a computerized charger, not one of the cheap ones you can buy at every store), showed only minor improvement. Still, they work fine, and thus being NiMH's (no memory effect), I always completely discharge them before charging. So let's see how long they will last."
2,NOT FOR SPEEDLITE EX FLASHES,"DO NOT BUY THESE BATTERIES IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BATTERIES FOR YOUR FLASH UNIT.I bought these batteries to use for my New 430 Speedlite EX II. My fault for not reading that for EX speedlite flashes you want to use Alkaline batteries...But these batteries could definitely be better. Their discharge rate is very quick. You end up only using them for very light energy consuming items such as toys, remote controls or clocks... I would not recommend for cameras or other electronics that use a lot of power.For the 430 speedlite, I could only use the flash twice before I'd have to recharge again."
5,These are 2300 mAh not 2500 as shown in the photos above.,"I bought these for my digital camera. I was apprehensive at first because the last Energizer rechargeable batteries I bought didn't hold a charge well. So far, these are working great. Hundreds of photos taken after the first charge and they're still going strong. So far, so good."
2,Short lifespan,These Energizers just don't last very many charge cycles. My other brand of rechargable NIMH batteries last and last. It has happened over several packs so I just don't buy them anymore. I figured they would be at least as good as the other name brands but they simply aren't.
1,Doesn't retain charge,"Wow...These batteries are so bad they do not hold charge for more than an hour. In fact, one package stopped gaining power after a few attempts of trying to recharge.Great concept, poor product. With the expense of these and the poor staying power, it is cheaper to go back to the standard batteries."
1,High self discharge,I see also what others have been reporting here - these batteries have a high self-discharge rate (which gets much worse with age). Try something else - there are recommendations in other reviews
2,Okay in some devices...,"The AAAs I have in my remote controls seem to last a very long time on one or two charges; of course the power-draw of a remote control is minimal. In contrast, I have had many problems with Energizer AAs used in digital cameras. While some of these batteries keep the Energizer Bunny going and going, for no discernible reason, many of them start showing as ""bad"" in the charger (blinking red light) after only a few charges, meaning... pregnant pause... the rabbit died.*Update, 27 FEB 2012* I am still using 4 of these batteries (of the 16 that I bought), and while they continue to limp along, the Rayovac Hybrids that I bought at the same time are by far superior... The Energizers power my camera for only a few hours, whereas the Rayovacs that I bought at the same time are still good for several days of camera use.Day and night. Even if the Energizers were being sold for $.25 each, I don't think I'd go there again."
1,Use them quick!,These batteries (brand new) lose their charge after a couple of days if not used. The self discharge rate is much too high.
2,I've just replaced my set of these,"I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera, I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin, and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them."
1,Used Batteries!!! Not New! BEWARE!!!!,"I bought 2 packages of these for my son's Shake and Go Speedway. Afterwards, I realized that I would need 2 more batteries for the race track, so I went and picked up an additional package of the same 4 batteries from Wal-Mart. I put the Wal-Mart batteries in one car, and the Amazon batteries in the other and the track itself. It was very obvious that the ""Wal-Mart car"" ran faster and farther than the ""Amazon Car."" The Amazon-run car sounded like it was dying compared to the other car. Also, the Amazon batteries were much harder to open, because the plastic was SUPERGLUED together!!! Rechargeable batteries lose a little power every time they need recharged. You can tell that these had been used and recharged for quite a while before being repackaged and resold. The price was too good to be true, and I fell for it."
1,Completely and utterly worthless,"I bought about $150 worth of these batteries in triple-A, double-A, 9-volt and C cell, along with the offically-supported charger.I first spent a few days just charging them all up, so that when I needed a battery, they'd be ready to go. A couple weeks later, my remote needed batteries.To my complete surprise, they were all completely depleted. I tried again to charge them all. A few weeks later, my mouse needs some double-A's. Depleted again.They had better rechargeable batteries 20 years ago - these are completely worthless."
3,batteries NOT INCLUDED...,"Ok, maybe amazon should only have reviews of things over like [..] bucks because...this review will be like this...AWESOME....batteries are normally batteries, unless you happen to buy these, which are normally [..] bucks and I got them for a total of 8.33 and never even had to pay shipping...anyway they are a really long lasting accu AA battery....recommmended....will"
2,Not very durable,I own one set of Olympus and one of Kodak rechargeable batteries. They are more durable than this Energyzer.
1,Rechargeable batteries overheat,"I used these batteries once, and now they will not charge properly. I use a Kodak NiMH charger that shuts down when done. The charger operates well using other NiMH cells. These Energizer batteries kept charging overnight and would not stop. The batteries got very warm. I believe that they are shorted."
5,"Great Play, Great Acting, Great Film","Mr. Frayn's play imagines and explores the motives and view of Physics Nobel Laureates and close friends Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg as their relationship is shattered by Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark and the subsequent persecution of Denmark's Jewish citizens. The actions are repeated several times, with interior monologue giving several perspectives of what may have happened and the participant's motives and reactions. Each time we go through the events, we gain new insight into the two scientists and Ms. Bohr. Mr. Frayn's commentary adds more understanding to the play's construction and Dr. Heisenberg's family's interview adds more perspective to Heisenberg's life and possible motivation. The staging and wardrobe provide context for the play and the acting. The actors are all superb."
5,Very good essay,"This film is strongly recommended, explores some possible talks between Bohr and Heisenberg that could prevent Germany for building atomic bomb first."
5,cliff sings,"bought the long player in 1959 but lent it out and it was never returned,since the mid sixties i have been trying to replace it,with no success(saw it once at a record fair on sale for 50,went home for the money,but when i got back it had been sold.Although Cliff Richard improved with age,in my opinion he never got better than this album. ""Cliff"" was not as good as Cliff sings,but still a nice piece of nostalgia.Cliff Richard mixes standards and rockers,on Cliff sings which is a format which doesnt always work(Gene Vincents debut album being a case in point,great singer,awful disc."
3,Baby Cliff,This cd is very early Cliff Richard who I feel got better with age. I do not care for the arrangements of most of these songs which is probably why Cliff never made it as big in the US as he did in England. The only song I was really sold on was Here Comes Summer. Almost all of these are remakes of somebody else's tunes.
4,NEVER COMPARE TO PSP VERSION.,"Okay Nintendo DS is graphically weaker then PlayStation Portable.And the developers pushed both versions to the limit.So be fair,okay if NDS was as graphically strong as PSP you could complain-But not this time.BurnOut 3:Legends is actually one of PSP`s Best Racing games,acording to reviews-and suprisingly i don`t see any PSP FansBoys or girls dissing it like they would usually do-But GameSpots review was not fair.Recommended if you own a NDS,if u own a PSP get that one-If you have both consoles get the PSP one(that was NOT a fanboy comment)."
1,This game is not suited for small screen,"I have played this game on the game cube and it was lots of fun. When I bought my DS-lite system this was the first game I bought. After playing it a couple of times, I realized that it was a strain for my eyes because the DS-lite screen is so small. The game is very good but not on small screen."
1,why was this game released?,"This game is the worst game I have ever played, on any system, in the 25 years of gaming I know! this ds version takes the poop cake hands down. Shame on ea for releasing this game to the public and wasting our hard earned money let alone time! it deserves a zero! and should only be played with a labotomy!"
2,TERRIBLE!,"when I saw this game I went nuts,so when I got IT I put IN my ds immediately and started playing IT within 10 minutes I was bored and riped off so I went to game stop and traded burnout legends and the sims 2 ds whch i got riped off on too.So I gave my ds to my little 8 year old brother and im going to get a psp and burnout legends for the psp,overall IF you want a nintendo ds don't get one because the games [except super mario 64 ds]have poor and i mean pooooooorrrrrrrr graphics."
4,The ways that this game is good and bad:,"I don't own a PS2 or Xbox, only a GameCube [and a DS]. When EA took over the series after Acclaim went bankrupt, they were stopped being made on the GameCube. I was very dissapointed. But when I saw this, it was a great sight. I could get a modern Burnout game!THE GOODSAll of the race modes I wanted... I LOVE ROAD RAGE ^_^.THE BADSLacks in graphics and CPU AI a tad bit.I noticed that the reviews on Amazon say the game is REALLY good, or REALLY bad. I think some people are trying to compare it to other burnout games, or not.COMPARED TO OTHER BURNOUT GAMES: It just doesn't stand up to Burnout 2, 3, or 4 [revenge].JUST BY ITSELF: The second best DS racer I've played [#1 is Mario Kart DS].WORTH IT? For 20 bucks on amazon, yes.Thanks for reading ^_^!!!p.s. out of all of the burnout games I've played [2, 3, revenge, and legends [ds]], burnout 3 is the best!"
1,Difficult to judge this book,This is a difficult book to write a review for.I agree with most/all of what the author writes but found the style highly annoying. The book contains huge amounts of waffle and very little real advice.I am using Neurofeedback for personal growth and hopped this would have some practical advice. There was very little of this.I understand it is difficult with an area like this to not be a bit of a salesman but way too much sales going on here.
1,dear god!,one word for this: BORING! what a snoozer! I could barely read this and hold up my head! why someone would get enjoyment out of this is beyond me! yawn-a-rific!
4,Good reference material,A lot of help while choosing fixtures to remodel our Craftsman bathroom. I'm sure it'll come in handy for more projects in our house before we're through. A lot of fun to skim for no particular reason too. I just wish it were a little longer.
5,Prompt service,"When ordering I always get good service, response is quick and get my product on time. Thank you."
3,"The fat man is singing ""Oh oh oh"".","The Taste of Christmas compilation is a collection of holiday music from artists on the Taste of Chaos tour, with exclusive newly recorded versions of Christmas songs. These bands were on the 2005 tour and were mostly unknown at the time, and for the most part are still unknown now. The best known group nowadays is the Plain White T's. The songs are of varying quality; there are some good ones and some bad ones. I like the cover versions of ""Happy Xmas"", ""Last Christmas"" and ""The First Noel"" and the original song ""We Might Be Alone Tonight"". Of the songs that I don't like, ""Christmassacre"" is the worst. This is a decent rock Christmas CD."
4,yeah...,"overall, this is actually a great Christmas cd. i'd say its weakest point is sadly Christmassacre by From First to Last. i was actually pretty disappointed, because i'm a pretty big fan of them. the high points on the cd would have to be definitely right where it starts. Bert McCracken does an awesome job with Happy Christmas (war is over), and it shows how well he can really sing. Miracle of Christmas by Funeral for a Friend is a great song as well. then Bert McCracken is back with the rest of the Used on Alone this Holiday, which is an amazing song."
5,The transforming power of soul love,"The insights in this book are many and profound, the journeys fascinating, the changes tremendous and exciting.Soul love is more evolved, and develops as you follow the exercises to overcome fears, and judgments, the road blocks to true love. Soul love transcends personality issues, so you make a deeper connection.The exercises in this book are designed to open the heart, resolve emotional issues, and there are really wonderful exercises for combining the different chakras (energy points).I can feel warmth flooding my chest area as I do this. Since I have started doing these exercises people seem to be responding to me more positively. You also tend to feel more positive to the world.This author was recommended to me by two other people, and I am now working on two of her other books.I highly recommend this book.The message of this book is a positive one waiting to be experienced by the wider world. I think you'll love it and I hope you found this review helpful."
3,An Awakening Experience,"This is the second book by this author and I am enjoying this awakening experience. Soul Love opened my eyes to reflecting on love, how to love even those I have not had positive experiences with, and much more. This book helped me to see the love that is within myself and how to express it outwardly. There were exercises to help one get in touch with what is within, unfortunately, for me, this exercise was repeated in its entirety in most every chapter. I found myself trying to skip through and felt that perhaps it should have been just explained once or twice, then referred to or directed to thereafter. Overall, this book was very enlightening and I look forward to reading more in this series."
5,if you want to tap into you then get this series!!!,This series has given me more towards connecting with me than any other... read this but do the exercises because they work!
4,Valuable contribution to consciousness training,"I don't as a rule enjoy 'self-help' books. ""Soul Love"" was a pleasant departure and lucidly portayed. The information given had an implied authority that I didn't feel was altogether proven however what I did understand, has proved valuable. The information may not have been as 'digestible' as the wonderful and revelatory ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years"" by Richard G. Patton (goes into similar material in a more profound manner), but it did make me question my motivating force during normal waking hours. I would certainly recommend this book for anyone even slightly interested in the subject of energy centers and their impact on daily living."
1,"Reader from Reading, PA","I found this book to be nothing but alot of mumbo jumbo, I felt as tho I was reading the same thing over and over and got very bored with it. alot of it made absolutely no sense to me either, I found it to be a real sleeper! Altho I did enjoy the first book I read from her, called spritual growth, that book was very interesting."
4,Mom likes,"Ordered for mother to help with blood pressure reduction. She seems to be happy with the purchase. Definitely, the way to purchase in quantity, especially if no local big box store."
3,optimistic theory?,"Kepel's book is well formed, serious and weighty. He used variety of sources in different languages; articles and books in French, German, Arabic, Turkish and English, as well as websites, newspapers, and interviews. Kepel analyzes the Islamist movement of the last five decades and focuses on the recent events in Muslim world. In the first part of his book he could have made parallelism with similar movements in Islamic world in early years especially in the Cultural Revolution Chapter. Kepel also makes hasty judgement about the decline of Islamist movement. Based on the events of the last couple of years in Europe and the Middle East, the decline of Islamism makes Kepel's theory only optimistic."
5,Consensus,"Kepel's book is considered an excellent source on political Islam by a variety of sources. The reviews are true. In this book, Kepel gives a thematic and historical explanation of Islamism. His writing also gives recent events in the Middle East a context and continuity that they deserve and is often ignored by our soundbyte media."
3,"It's Ok, but not great","Good quality, the brightness is ok, not great. If you want more brightness, the 9 led for about 5 bucks are better. Also, the focusing intensity is one of the odds"
3,It's a flashlight,"I bought this little light to replace a Mag Light that died. It works, but no great shakes, but is fine for carrying in my vehicle."
3,Good but not great,"It's nice and compact with a solid feel to it. While not as powerful as a regular full size flashlight (more expensive though) it does have a nice clean light. The color and even diffusion of the light makes this led flashlight more usable than the brighter ugly yellow lights. When you use this light indoors it lights up a wide area and makes it easier to see than the tunnel vision styled focused lights.I recommend it for the glove compartment, looking behind TV's, or emergency lighting. I DO NOT recommend it for long term outage usage (except for battery life) since there are much brighter lights for less and batteries don't cost that much."
4,Get what you pay for,"I gave 4 stars because you get what you pay for. This is a quality built item with 3 white LEDs for the bulb. Its not the brightest thing by any means, but its small, inexpensive and well made. Best use is for short distances."
4,Great flashlight,"Perfect flashlight. If the butt end was smaller, it would be perfect. It barely fits into my sunvisor sleeve holder. Long lasting batteries, and great lighting. What else do you buy a battery for?"
3,"Good for database programming, but good for little else","This book covered a great deal on database programming, but very little on anything else. This was a dissapointment for me, since the title of the book was ""C++ Builder Unleashed"" and not ""C++ Builder Database Programming Unleashed"".It was also a nice reference on Creating Components and bypassing VCL Events and dealing directly with the Win32 API, although it didn't quite cover well on why you would want to do so.I bought this book because I was interested in some of the intermediate and advanced concepts that were not covered in Teach Yourself Borland C++ in 21 Days. I came back dissapointed, not any better off than when I started."
2,Disappointing...,"This was one of the most difficult books to readI have read in recent memory. The code is abouthalf way explained, disorganized, and errors abound.Trust me on this one. Try one of the other books.C++Builder is an awesome development tool.It deserves better than this"
2,Find the LEASH,"I expected more from this books after going through its contents. The database sections is invaluable for DB beginners, but the basics as far as ANSISTRING, STRINGLISTS, and/or integrating C++ Builder, C++, and real-world solutions to application development never rears its head. This book is not consistent and is choppy in its presentation. Overall, it is good for the advanced Visual C++ programmer as an intro to C++ builder."
2,"Tried 2 show how philosophical Charlie is, ! how to use BCB","Charlie covered a lot of interesting topics. However, there are too much preaching about his programming philosophy and not enough explanation on each topic. Many of the examples contradict his programming style."
3,Thrown together,It is obvious from reading this book that Charlie was rush. Several chapters contain references to Pascal syntax leading me to believe they were borrowed in large part from Delphi 2 Unleashed. On the positive side Charlie does cover alot of interesting material in this book and I don't regret spending the money.
2,Borodins books are good but not that good!,"I do hope that the price for that book is a typo. $71.66? You have to be kidding, Oh, I forgot. plus shipping!"
2,Not the same as QuicTrac Platinum 1.0,"which they don't make anymore......this shoe is supposedly made with the same last, but it is nowhere near as comfortable....."
4,Another good novel from Neil,"I have all of Neil's novels and this one rates close to being one of his best, with my favourite being 'The Innocence of Age'.A well read and intelligent author, do yourself a favour and add this and his other books to your library."
4,Psycho-Thriller starring Richard Burton Is Worth Watching!,"Richard Burton is my absolute favorite actor,bar none. I was pretty stoked to discover this film since I had never seen it,nor heard of it.Even if you aren`t quite the huge RB fan I am,you should still enjoy this psycho-thriller set in a British parochrial(sp?) boys` school.A bit slow starting out but does pick up and ""worth the watch"".Burton is at home in his role as the cantankerous,mildly-sadistic Headmaster of the school.Somewhat predictable but with a decent surprise ending--and one actually shocking scene! Recommended for all my fellow Richard Burton fans 100%!Worth buying it used for you non-believers,too! ;)Thank You for reading!"
2,Absolution Review of DVD,"It's great to find a hard to find movie on DVD, story and plot aside, the only problem with this DVD is that the video quality is quite poor. I'm not sure what master was used for the transfer, but the quality of the image is far below what we expect today from DVD releases. If you're a stickler for image quality, I would think otherwise before buying this DVD."
1,"really bad,,,,I haven't got my purchase and it's May 19",please send me the book asapit's really bad to do business like this
4,A Solid Primer,"Enlightened Democracy: The Case for the Electoral College is a solid primer for those who are either simply unfamiliar with the Electoral College and Election Process as a whole, or for those who would like to know more about our nation's great, democratic structure. Ross tackles the widely debated issue of the Electoral College by first providing a detailed background on our Founding Fathers and their decision to form such a process and then moving on to not only explain the Electoral College thoroughly but also to list its numerous advantages and past successes in helping our nation select a Commander-in-Chief."
5,Nawwab's Poems Close Gaps in Understanding,"If you have ever wondered what occupies the mind and sensibility of a 21st century Saudi Arab woman, The Unfurling is a must-read.Nimah Ismail Nawwab brings to the page spare language, keen intelligence, an open and honest heart, and a spirit that soars. Her poems-about family, culture, faith, tradition, and change-take us into an world unfamiliar to most Americans. It is no accident that Nimah Nawwab's first book of poetry, has been written in English, rather than her native Arabic: The Unfurling is a gift, a generosity, an invitation. It is also clear evidence that Nawwab is, at heart, a healer, a woman who understands what's at stake and what lies at the center of a peaceful world.Pit Menousek Pinegarwww.pitpinegar.comauthorNine Years Between Two Poems (1996)The Possibilities of Empty Space (1997)The Physics of Transmigration (spring, 2005)"
3,Not what the title leads you to expect,"When this book came out, I bought it right away. I was very disappointed- this book is not what the title lead me to expect. Chapters 1 -11 are about building a very precise scale model of Warrior. Chapter 12 is about ballasting the model, and a short epilogue covers launching and sailing. The author's craftmansship and technique is superb, but if you already have a book or two on shipmodelling skills, you'll probably find this material redundant. There is nothing about using a sail control unit to control the square sails. I know how to build static ship models, I wanted info about building a working model. This book does not deliver on the promise of the title! As a display model building book, I'd give it 5 stars, but as a sailing model book, it gets 1 star-- that averages out to 3!"
1,nano doesn't fit!,"Great idea, but poorly constructed. The plug doesn't come close to aligning with the nano. This company doesn't list any customer care number, so this is going to be difficult to get replaced...."
3,Incomplete,"If one is going to put out something with as definitive a title as Millenium Collection, how can they omit four of Diamond's greatest songs, Cherry Cherry, Kentucky Woman, Shilo and Solitary Man? I am sure there are other significant omissions too from later in his career (September Mornings?), and surely there is room on today's modern CDs to have included more than 12 songs. Don't get me wrong, the songs on here are great and they sound fine, but I am just very disappointed in the selection. A more appropriate title would be Some of Neil Diamond's Greatest Hits."
4,Classic Neil,"This has a nice mix of Neil Diamond songs, especially good for those who don't like everything he has done but prefer select tunes. There are several ""extra"" songs that I did not care for, things I'd never heard or that just didn't reflect his quality or style; it would have been better had the producers opted to use some of the songs they left out (i.e. Shiloh, Cherry-Cherry, You'll Be a Woman Soon).Overall, it's a great addition to my collection and very reasonably priced."
4,"The album ""12 Greatest Hits"" should have been","In Nov.1989 I bought a used vinyl LP of ""Neil Diamond:His 12 Greatest Hits"" on MCA.I was a bit disappointed that ""Sweet Caroline"" & ""Holly Holy"" were live versions.(It didn't even say on the cover or label these songs were ""live""!) Not that the live versions are bad,it's just that I expected the studio versions I'd always heard on radio.This Millennium Collection corrects that & includes the studio versions of those songs,not to mention far better sound quality than the LP.I would have liked to see ""Done Too Soon"" from the LP here but I'm glad they didn't include the inferior re-recording of one of his Bang label hits,""Shilo"". This is the best single disc album of Diamond's early 70's work for the UNI/MCA label."
2,"Lame, but tolerable","This is not Powers' best book. Quite the opposite, really. But it IS a fair, light read. I can't honestly recommend it to anyone but a hard-core Powers fan; his writing style does shine through at some points. If you see it used, pick it up, but do not base an opinion of Powers' writing on this book alone."
1,An early work for completists only.,"I've loved (or at least liked) all the other Powers books I've read, which is to say all but a few early ones. I finally found this in a used bookstore for $1, which is more than the story is worth. I honestly don't know how it got published it is so bad. It's not worth paying a lot for to complete your collection. Just keep an eye out if you have to have it."
1,a bad book by a great author,This is a bad book by a great author. Do yourself a favor by reading other Powers books first. Then skip this one altogether.
3,Surprised,"When I received the shirts and saw they were labeled ""Hanes"" I expected a real deal, but unfortunately, the shirts shrunk even in warm water..."
2,Disappointing operas,"Although the staging of both of these operas is stunning and the orchestra playing as well as the singers are top notch, theyleft me totally unimpressed. Musically they both lack ideas and fail at creating the atmosphere suited to their respective subject matter. The Zemlinsky I admired in his Mermaid Symph. and the Lyriche Symphony is nowhere to be heard. Ullmann is even a lessercomposer. His Broker Jug is full of recitatives and the 40 minutes of this opera becomes endless. However I thank the LA opera forbringing them to the attention of all opera lovers."
4,Feminism and Jayne,"You would not ordinarily expect Jayne Mansfield to be held up as a feminist model, but that's what Martha Saxton does in this unusual book.Martha takes the view that Jayne was a cluster of paradoxes - very intelligent yet ""played dumb,"" very down-to-earth yet adaptive to an extreme degree of glamour, very ambitious yet reticent in a strange way.I learned a lot about who we were in the American 50s because of this book, and enjoyed the ride - except for the very end of Jayne's life in the tragic auto accident."
3,is this really made to go with vortex bins???,"I'm amazed at whoever designed this product. When I tried to run the webbing with the eyelets through the bino attachment slots they would not fit. Even with Vortex Binoculars! I thought I was going to break the binoculars and injure myself forcing them through. Finally I used a pair of pliers to squeeze and flatten the the metal eyelets and they finally went through. I was furious with Vortex by the time I got done. (they do supply an alternate method of attachment but it's not nearly as nice and I expect a Vortex Harness to work with Vortex binoculars, at least anything other than compacts.) This is why the product is getting a three star rating. Once done the harness works very well. Too bad somebody was asleep on the job."
1,Laughs A-Plenty!,"I found this book in my local public library, and the title alone had me snickering in the aisle. God only knows what the mild little woman at the check-out counter thought of me. Released at the heels of the mid 80's ""Satanic Panic,"" the authors of this book warn the reader of the legion of Satanists that walk among us. Hordes of Darkness, indeed!Watch out! That girl in your 3rd period study hall, you know the one...she gets her clothes at that weird store in the mall and flouts convention! Stay away from her! She treads the Left Hand Path, and will lead you into a life of deceit and mayhem! I know what you're saying, ""Naaah, it'll never happen to MEEEE!"" Won't it? This book reads like a script from one of those '50's educational films. Buy it for the sheer kitschiness of it all. It's only two bucks and change.When you read this book, you'll know just how easy it is to go from being a casual Iron Maiden fan to baby killer and grave-robber! Don't say I didn't warn you, sinner!"
5,Absolutely Great!!,"Buy one of these. 3Com is the god of ethernet adapters. I have a Sony VAIO 3ghz hyperthreading technology computer and it's on-board ethernet port has suddenly started giving me slow speed (i'm on 2mb DSL and it was giving me 8kbps!) i guess it was due to corrupted drivers. I couldnt be bothered to mess around with it, so i grabbed my 3Com etherlink XL from one of my old spare computers, and now i have my normal speed back. Highly recommended!"
5,Does what is supposed to,"I have had no problems with this product. I have 2 of them, which I use in two different computers. They work absolutely fine."
3,I got this for one song,"I got this for the title track, which is a great song, danceable, groovin' etc. However, I was looking forward to seeing if the rest was any good.....not really. I can't judge the artist from the other two tracks on the disk....maybe her other stuff is ok."
2,Really not that good...,"Well first off I think the first two reviews are written by the creators... Who in the normal public writes THAT much like that about a movie? *cough* no one *cough*Roger Ebert has it right.. a ""demonstration"" theres no good story. All this is, is just a technically well done movie... yet 0 story or background etc... Some of the editing is really bad and there are huge jump cuts that dont match up to anything and look really off....I really dont think it is as good as people are making it out to be.. and people i've watched it with say the same.Some of the bonus features are a joke... but some are pretty cool.IF you want to kill an hour or so get this and run through it. At least you can get inspired to do something yourself after watching it. Interesting to see it after all the hype etc."
3,Just Okay,"The value of this product isn't the story or the quality of the production. It's the marketing. What these guys have done is take a pretty unremarkable story, dressed it up to look pretty, and marketed the crap out of it. I learned nothing from the DVD extras. I'm not saying that this is a crap product, though. I respect what they've done and look forward to broken the feature length movie."
2,Not all that glitters.,"I am not a professional film critic, so this is just my lowly indie film maker opinion (I believe most other comments on this site are from the filmmakers themselves, no proof, just a hunch)FILMPoor plot, poor acting, low end effects, GREAT MARKETING!SPECIAL FEATURESdefinitely worth the money if you are an aspiring weekend indie film-maker with your teenage friends......but if you are serious about learning how to pull off effects, or enjoy watching short films, well...you know that feeling you get when you're falling back in your chair and you catch yourself, and then still fall anyways? it's a lot like how you feel after you watch this DVD, and then glance at your wallet.Regards,"
1,Sima Hitch Slow and Missing Quality,"When you hold a Ipod in your hand you can feel the quality built into the unit. But pick up the Sima Hitch and you immeditately get the feeling that they skimped everywhere they could to build this thing.The first unit I got through Amazon was DOA on arrival in it's sealed box. The vendor took his sweet time to get back to me.I called Sima and they were very accomodating, I shipped the product to them and they returned it and they replaced it with a brand new unit.The Unit does NOT work on all USB devices as advertised - USB HARD DRIVES are ignored and unrecognized.The wheel is cheeply made and I dont think it will be long before it breaks.The Transfers are SLOW at best.My Recommendation, wait and see if they come out with a Hitch 2.0"
1,You Get What You Pay For...,"This product normally sells for over $100 and I purchased it for $18. It was presented as ""new,"" not refurbished or returned. Well, it arrived in a re-tapped package and didn't work. The distributor doesn't respond to emails and has no printed return policy.Buyers beware...you get what you pay for!Don O."
2,No hard drive,"It does what the description describes but other devices with same feature set are in $20 range, most similar devices in this $ range include a few GB of onboard storage."
5,Good Start,"I found this book to be great for the ""first time"" inexperienced Small Business starter. It is full of practical tips and examples. The web links it provides to informative websites saves alot of time on research.I greatly recommend this book."
1,Never received product,Going through a list of my purchases and I realized I never received this product. I'm sure it would've been great for my little one had I received it.
5,Geometry-success in 20 minutes a day,I am a homeschooling mother of 2 high school students. I have been teaching geometry but with great difficulty. It has been 30 years since I have taken geometry and it was not a happy experience then and a struggle now. We do use a regular textbook but they are not always as clear a I would like them to be. I have been using this book as a back up in teaching the basics. They are clearly presented and easy to grasp. Each chapter presents a concept with self tests to make sure you understand before you go on the the next idea. It is a great suppliment to our textbook and a good review for the GED test.
3,"Sufficient, but Not Perfect","My daughter was struggling with Geometry (specifically with proofs). This text allowed her to get a basic overview of geometric concepts before tackling formal proofs. This is great as a refresher course, although you'll need another source to actually practice the formal proofs.There were a couple of answers in the answer key that were incorrect as well, which can certainly be misleading for others who might stumble over that them."
1,HORRIBLY WRITTEN AND A WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this book hoping to brush up on geometry before school started, but the grammar is so badly done that I couldn't stand reading it. However, bad grammar isn't the reason why I'm writing this review, but because a lot of the math is contradicting, horrifically written and incorrect.If you are a beginner, teacher of geometry, preparing for a test or anything else that makes you want to buy this book, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. You'll have better luck with the ""______ for dummies"" series than these books, especially the geometry version."
1,There is little of geometery in this book,"The book lacks the essentials of a teaching, or a learning geometry textbook. Other posters found the book an excellent introductory geometry textbook. Perhaps that book helped those reviewers in their endeavor to learn geometry. My issue with their conclusions is that what geometry they have learned. The fact is most of the geometry books used in classrooms or in homeschool are plagued with errors, inaccuracies and false pretences, e.g. most of those books list a good number of postulates most of them are theorems their proofs are abound in the literature. Unfortunately those books are the pillars upon which this book is built.Teaching algebra in a book pretended to be a geometry textbook does not make the algebra geometry."
3,Buck Owens...early Buck,"Unfortunately, I did not notice that this was a cassette when I ordered it...my error, not the seller. As a result I have not been able to give it a quality listen. However, I was looking for a recording of Buck Owens doing ""Hot Dog"" to compare with his earlier recording of ""Hot Dog"" as Corky Jones. Same song, as good as always. Will transfer to CD to get more listening time on this one."
4,Standard work on the subject,"This is one of Kunz's many books on jewellery and gems and is a standard work on the subject - a must for any serious gem library or anyone interested in the history and folklore of gems. It is not intended as a handbook on how to turn your neighbour into a frog or tell the future from a crystal... I only give it 4 rather than 5 stars because, typically with Kunz, it is not fully referenced and it is very difficult to trace where some of his statements and quotes come from. An annotated version would be nice! That said, poor referencing seems usual with older books (this was written and first published over a century ago) and Kunz is not alone in being a tantalising mixture of copious research and frustratingly poor referencing."
2,Short & Pointless,"Is the writer a man or woman, I guess with a name like Chris it could be either but Im guessing its a man. It just didnt gel for me, the experiences of the female character exhibiting some of the traits & behaviour that she does after enduring shocking & traumatic abuse, also the characters in general are unbelievable & 1 dimensional. The writing style seems contrived while it appears to be aiming for clever & intellectual, it falls short & only succeeds in seeming vague & pointless, I particularly disliked the writers tendency to repeat certain phrases 3 times which happens a fair bit. Obviously I did not enjoy this story, though the subject matter may not be to everyones taste, it was the lack of depth in the characters & the writing style I found tasteless."
2,Disappointing,It was highly recommended as bright new fiction. I was very disappointed at its dark tone and theme of hopelessness. People looking for those ideas in a novel might like it better than I did.
3,no sample,i requested a sample. i love samples and buy or not based on that. all that came was reviews of another book. what's with that?
2,No project,"As his underground novel `The Virgin of Flames' (serious `Kitsch with Conviction' with Jesus as a Homeboy), `Becoming Abigail' doesn't transcend the pure facts, as horrible as they may be.There is no vision, no context, no frame, no (to use a big noun) message, only happenings.Yet, all the elements for a strong case were there: Africa, England, abuse of power, (in)justice, child prostitution, human trafficking.The construction of the novella is original with its alternation of the past and the present.But it doesn't raise question marks for the reader. It is only a summing up of this happened then, and this is happening now. It doesn't surpass an exercise in style.A huge disappointment from the author of `Song for Night'."
1,caution advised,"According to Thomas Hobbes, ""the life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,"" which also describes not only the main character of this novella but also the quality of writing. This is one of the very few books I'll neither keep nor give away, but simply discard, because it's so thoroughly unpleasant I have no further use for it and wouldn't wish it on anyone else. The style is episodic, shallow, and pretentious, wallowing in the worst kind of poetic indulgence. The minimal plot is a genuine downer. My only recommendation is to steer clear."
4,Cody's Review for Logitech Freedom 2.4 GHz Cordless Joystick,I was tempted to buy this joystick mainly because it was cordless. I don't like cords running along my desk. When I installed this joystick make sure to restart your computer because in the instructions it doesn't tell you to do so. You need to do so in order to move on to the next step. So after that little confusion everything worked just fine. It responds very well in my Flight Simulator X.Appearance:The joystick itself is the same size as the PRO version. The base is smaller and it has less keys. Also there was no grips on the bottom so it easily slides when you move the stick part of it.4/5
2,Nice Product But,"After a month of use it just stopped working, I changed the batteries and it will not be recognized by the PC. Go figure, you are probably better of with a wired product."
5,It's a Great Joystick!,It will function from across the room (about 6-10 ft.). Setup is easy. The flight simulators are a lot easier with this joystick. Great!
1,Perfect joystick -- until..,..the microswitches of the POV switch loose contact (bad solder points) or the X/R-axis potentiometers wear out (after 1-6 weeks). The latter just happened to my 5th (!) Freedom 2.4 after 3 weeks (the former doesn't happen if you resolder them switches after you unpacked the stick..) I'm done w/ Logitech until they change back to non-mechanical pickups for the X/Y/R axis (like the Interceptor.) I'd recommend the Logitech WingMan Extreme Digital 3D or (if you can get your hands on one..) the Microsoft Force Feedback 2 (red skin edition). Stay away from the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick -- the pot problem is worse w/ that one !(...)
1,Lack of quality craftmanship,"I have had no problems with any of the Logitech products (including their joysticks). This Logitech Freedom has given me nothing but problems. After using two defective joysticks, I lost my patience.The joystick wouldn't respond to movement right after I took it out of the box and installed the software. I liked the idea of having a cordless joystick, so I got a replacement. After 1 month with the new one (and not having used it in 2 weeks) one of the buttons stopped functioning. I have never had a problem with Logitech joysticks in the past--but this one has been a hassle! Save yourself trouble and money--don't buy the cordless!The joystick is flimsy and button placement is terrible. The only thing nice about the cordless is that beam range is excellent and it's a USB. Don't waste your money on this! (Unless you want to have a 'new' joystick every month)."
2,Product controls,"The Throttle control is to small and not in a good location on the Joystick. The different buttons are OK, but for use in Flight Simulator, they are not in a good location. Overall performance is OK, but not exceptional. I feel that the price is not consistant with the expectations of the Joystick. I expected more."
2,Maybe just bad luck....but,I recieved the joystick. It's really amazing....it feels great in my hands. LOOKS AMAZING. Installs very easily....doesn't work. For some reason the joystick did not recognize the reciever. It is currently on its way back to amazon. (great great customer service...really appreciate it :) )
2,STUPID BATTERY'S!,"Slick exspensive joystick. By the way you have to make sure the scencor reads the joystick for it to work. anyways I had the battery's go out on me in the middle of a flight. so my tip to you is either have back up key board keys for flying or get a new joystick.Good pc games:halflifeC-strikeBattle field 1942 (the ultimate war game)You can drive tanks boats, jeeps, motorcycles, planes carriers etc. helocopters too."
1,Not much use if it doesn't work,"Wireless is a cool feature, very convenient. The weight is good, grip is nice and firm, but the whole thing is not particularly ergonomic, though -- kinda awkward to hold with the other hand while you're playing. Real problem, though: this thing isn't built to last. At all. After a few months, it starts losing calibration, floating all over the place, with the twist function failing to neutralize -- rendering the joystick useless. You can't recalibrate it, and there's zero support from logitech, so suddenly the relative bargain starts looking like less of a good deal. Not getting a replacement -- check out some of the other brands out there."
5,Great product,"The instructions didn't mention it, but for Mac users it was a simple plug and play operation once the batteries were installed. After that -- start flying! It's being used for the ""Flyboys"" game for which it works very well.Thanks Logitech!"
2,Worked great .. for 2 Days,"Man I was So excited to get this , Took it out pluged it up Worked nicely.. had a slight leftwards pull that seemd to go away after i used the Clear clabrations utility I got from Logitec, however on day 3 it stoped working, would not connect to its reciever just sat there and Blinked ... So I said ok no problem ill go and look up the supprt information at logitec.. no help there , closest thing I could find for an answer was the batteries were going bad.. nope .. new batteries and still not working.. Ive since sent it back to amazon to get a refund and am now in search of a different model. I guess I should of red these reviews more closely.. ive found a few that said theirs went out soon after plugging in also .... Logitec ,, bad"
3,Interferance,"The corded version would be money much better spent, at least for me. I had major interferance problems with my ney iMac and airport extream."
4,Decent enough,"OK, I use this stick for space in a not-so-common MMORPG. I've been in space with this stick more times than not, that my friend often forget what my toon looks like. Anywho, when my first freedom broke, i went out and bought a saitek x-52, since its highly recommended. Well, it was so awkward I just hung up my wings till I found me another Freedom.my first freedom jsut quit responding to the sensor. I don't really know what caused it, but I love the stick so much that soon enough, I will be back into space flying to my heart's content!"
5,Cordless is the way to go,"This is on my kids' computer, and I never saw a need for cordless k/b or mice for them, until now. Great product. Easy set up and I trust the brand name for quality and support."
1,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004,"If you would like a really good joystick for MS FS 2004, don't under any circumstances buy this one! I've had it for less than a month and it's already going wrong. Although the idea is a good one the joystick continually loses the wireless connection, despite the fact that I've got the transmitter sitting right next to it. You also find that the buttons fire off with out you even touching them so, as an example, you'll be flying a plane and all of a sudden the gear will descend for no reason at all. My advice is buy a USB joystick and leave this well alone."
5,A good joy stick.,The Logitech Fredom 2.4 GHz Cordless Joystick was recognized by my Mac in true plug and play fashion. The action on the joystick is smooth and the build quality is very good for it's price. I highly recommend this joystick.
4,Works well with Fedora Linux,"I am not a gamer. I do like this joystick, it was very easy to install it in Linux."
2,Not for a Mac!,"This joystick is advertised as compatible with Mac systems, specifically OS 8.6 or later. In reality, it is incompatible with System 10 and barely compatible with system 9 since it has no applicable software for Mac. The advertising is wrong and should be changed to ""Not for Mac, PC only"". Very frustrating."
2,Wears out quickly,"Just as the other Logitech joysticks I've owned, the Freedom 2.4 cordless joystick lost calibration. Maybe not as quickly as the Attack 2 or the Extreme 3D Pro did, but the result is the same. I did get a couple of months out of the Freedom 2.4 before the controller stopped working properly. And I'm not even a serious gamer! Oh, and don't bother trying to contact Logitech about the quality of their products. They won't respond. I've tried 3 of their controllers because they've been all I've been able to find on the shelves here. Let the consumer beware!!!"
4,Easy to use and has great design,"Since I recently bought the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, I needed a joystick with features that the Logitech Freedom provides. It handles very well with its ten preset button fuctions. I just got another Pc game Pacific Flighters and it also works well along side the mouse. I'm happy no wires to worry about, total freedom of movement, sole attention to the game."
2,"Good Idea, but poor quality.","Logitech gets an A for effort and a D for execution for the 2.4 Freedom cordless joystick. I really like the cordless idea and the communications with the PC works well. It is a little overly anxious to shut down to save power, but push any button and it wakes up again.It is the buttons and potentiometers that are the problem. I am on my second joystick now because the first one lost two buttons to failure and the twist jumped around all over the place making my jet fighter fly really poorly. I have had the second one installed for about a month now and the twist is starting to go again.I hope Logitech takes the good cordless approach and adds a little quality to the switches on their next attempt at a high quality cordless joystick. They just got too cheap this time."
2,"3rd Logitech 2.4 Cordless i have used, lost responsivness","This is the third one that i have gotten, each time from a different supplier, i really like the cordless function but even that can get bothersom. For example, if your sitting on the runway for awhile, or holding a straight and level flight pattern, and you dont touch it for a certain amount of time, it goes into ""stand-by"" or something, which can get very annoying when you go to bank left and it doesnt respond, so you have to start pushing buttons or something.As well as, all 3 that i have used, have lost calibration in one or two areas, each time it was when i would put the stick in the uppper-left of lower-right corners, it wouldnt move, its a worthless stick from what i have noticed and i would never use it again, ill stick with my sidewinder"
1,Broke...,"Top ball with hanging hook split in half and broke immediately after I opened the package, so now I can't hang it which was the reason I got it."
4,"If you liked Dinner's in the Freezer, get this, too.","While the book covers much of the same material as Dinner, it's updated and expanded to include breakfast and lunch. It's definitely a different book. There's more information about regional produce markets, and a recipe index. I'm disappointed that there aren't forms to photocopy like there are in ""Dinner.""If you've never cooked in quantity, this book will take you by the hand and make it easy.Now, to be picky, the math in the benefits section leaves much to be desired (waaay overstating the value of buying in bulk), and an appendix that was promised in the bulk buying section wasn't included. Both of those bugged me, but it's worth the effort to go beyond these and other editing errors to get to the information."
5,Great Speaker System,This is a great audio system for the price. I bought these at least five or six years ago and they still work great! They get nice and loud when you want them too and the sub puts out pretty good bass. I would definitely recommend it and purchase them again.
2,"Horns, strings and backup-singers don't work here.","What a huge disappointment! Now I know why this title has been out-of-print for so long. What sacrilige to ruin 'Dreams' with horns. In fact, there are horns all over this disc. The Cowboy songs don't work here at all. I'm don't know what Mr. Allman was thinking when he chose this ensemble, but it just doesn't fly with this long-time ABB fan. Take away the strings, horns and those mixed-too-far-up-front back-up singers and this disc may have been far better than it is. I want my money back Polydor!"
5,Long-forgotten gem,"This is a 1974 New York concert by then-hot singer Gregg Allman and his solo band, fleshed out by horns and an orchestra, with guest shots by the forgotten Capricorn band, Cowboy, stuck in the middle to kill time while Gregg rested his trademark vocals, I guess. This came when ""Laid Back,"" his best solo album, was riding high, but this band doesn't dwell too much on it. They are tight, however, with their endings and middles and full stops enough to give you whiplash. Jaimoe and keyboardist Chuck Leavell are here, from the Allman Brothers Band. ""Queen of Hearts"" is the best cut, with the tempo just right, the vocals soulful and even the backup singers, which I usually hate, sounding right. This comes from the era when huge touring bands were the rage, like the Joe Cocker ensemble, Mad Dogs & Englishmen. You don't see this anymore today, so this makes an interesting artifact from a by-gone day. Musically, it has held up very well."
5,Great sounds!,I would definitely purchase more music from this group--great sounds and music that gets you in the Christmas spirit! Nice change.
1,looks great but.......,"The watch was delivered quickly, it looked great but after wearing it less then 3 weeks the leather straps fell apart. My son can not wear it any more."
3,On Mitchell's Federal Zone,"This work is recommended to the astute and prudent jurist or legal scholar as well as citizens seeking a thorough understanding in areas of jurisprudence and revenuing.Well written with thorough insights on subjects you likely might have felt aready in mastery of such as federalism, central government rights & states rights, waiver of civil liberties, and constitutional law. Composed in a manner that could aid many people and is probably easy for any studet of competency to understand. The Supreme Law School has done a great deal of original research and is the only legal institution I know of with a faculty conversant in global federalism and treaty law; which are absolutely essential to legal fundamentals.The work is my particularly recommended reading for law students & will quite disabuse you of your illusions. Whilst finding some matter explored and satisfied less than completely the volume overall stands as probably the most important legal work of the 20th century."
5,Perfect,"Just what I was looking for. Nothing fancy, just good meals for the family. Amazon had it at the right price, one click and it's at my door. Couldn't be better then that."
4,No complaints,"This man can blow a horn. Nice collection here, and sound quality is decent. One can see why King Oliver was so influential."
5,nice and useful backpack,"reasonable price and fast delivery.the backpack is bigger than medium size, but by putting too much heavy things in there will hurt your shoulder. good for a leisure day trip or no more than one heavy textbook."
4,Great Backpack,"I'm in college and so I often have to carry many heavy books at a time. This backpack works wonders, its strong and sturdy and is big enough to hold all the books i need. The strap never slips off like other backpacks. Not to mention all the compliments i get on how pretty it is."
2,New York Art Punk Copied and Pasted.,"I'll make this short and sweet; the editiing in this film really ruins its credibility. There are are a ton of awkward cuts during the interviews. The cuts become so frequent that you're not sure exactly who or what the artist is talking about or referring to. The first time I watched this movie, the edititng didn't bother me so much, but upon the second view, the director's bias towards certain musicians was clearly demonstrated through the copying and pasting of interview clips.just because it is an indie film doesn't make it profound or even good. I probably could have made this movie in my highschool intro to film class."
4,"Long overlooked, Bobbie needs a 2 cd comp.","The brilliant early work of Bobbie Gentry was a great addition to the American and pop country scene. This is a welcome cd, although her great overlooked Patchwork lp should be unearthed. Where is this great lady today??More tracks would have made this more satisfying!"
5,One Summer Eve On the Tallahassie Bridge...,"A big time ignored and underrated soulful delta bottom vocalist has immortality written all over that southern country style. Giving some credit where it is due. Some stations play ""Ode.."", but do you hear ""Fancy"" (another big Gentry hit) that much? Legend has it that music pushers wanted a hip brunette singer..like Cher...not southern country like Gentry. Gentry was also thought too voluptuous for where pop was going (obviously Cher must not have been percieved as voluptuous in the 60's)...little did those folks know that sszx sells more music than what was originally imagined. Still, those of us who were there know how talented Gentry really is, in addition to being a quite a looker."
5,One of the best pop/rock albums ever!,"This is a hall of fame thing. You need to own this like you need to have Born in the USA -Bruce Springsteen, or Chicago - 17 or Police - Synchronicity or Roxy Music - Avalon. This is a defining moment - duest best release and an album that they will never do again. Fantastic!!!"
4,A little watered down--they're best when they go one on one,"The kings of blue-eyed caucasian soul were at the height of their popularity when they produced ""H2O"" in '82. As far as listenability, this is one of their strongest records, but re-listens gradually shave off some of the glam to reveal watered-down, disruptive gloom. ""Maneater,"" which might be too sexist even for a battle-of-the-sexes piece, is mighty good, as is their ridiculously fresh cover of Mike Oldfield's ""Family Man."" The structure of ""Open All Night"" is superb, and it makes an uninteresting concept that's lost its appeal after being used two thousand times seem pretty catchy again. But whereas most of their older songs seemed to be intended for a specific person, this collection seems too broadly-directed to work as well as it should. The crown jewel is ""One on One,"" which is flawlessly produced, straight to the point, and delicious."
4,Good overview for restoring classic cars,"Jim Richardson, seen on the syndicated ""My Classic Car"" series writes a good overview of restoring cars. He covers how to choose a specific car and teh steps necessary for a bsic restoration. Of course a car nut will still want to read a more definitive book for their car but this is a good first step"
2,One of the weakest of McCrea,"Although Joel McCrea is always good to watch, this is not a good western. It is a very slow and predictable one. I recommend Wichita, Stranger on Horseback and Stars on my Crown."
1,"Poor Richard is ""poor"" reading",Not impressed with the information in this book. Chapters 10-13 were ok but nothing to write home about. Some good tips on low cost recruiting using the net but nothing I was interested in as a recruiter in CA.
1,Not impressed,Poor Richard should have stuck to his almanac. This book was not helpful to me in trying to recruit on the Internet. Surfing around on your own will provide you with more up-to-date information.
4,"Hey, this is a really useful book!","Well, I run a highly regarded job and community site for the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond, and I see a lot of stuff professing to help folks use the Net to find jobs. A lot of it is useless or marginal.This book is very useful, very realistic about all the job help out there on the Net. It's very down to earth, and to the point. It includes a lot of stuff, very current, which is hard given the rapid pace of change.If I were looking, and didn't know a lot about what's going on, this book would be perfect. It'll also be good for people who know a lot, since it offer perspectives a Net veteran might lack.The book also helps in unexpected ways, like letting people with DSL or cable modems know that they better do a little security upgrade.Again, I've seen a lot of stuff, and I really recommend this book."
2,Squirrels around here don't like it much,"I'm not sure why but it seems that the squirrels around my neighborhood (in San Antonio, TX) don't really like this. I've hung it in a couple of different, but easily accessible spots but the squirrels only occasionally sample it. It's been hanging for about six weeks now and it's not even one-third eaten. If I hang out a real corn cob for the squirrels, it will be gone in one day. I was also not very impressed with the metal hanger that comes with this. I recommend a better washer on the bottom and using something to secure the (too-small) wing nut."
3,Defective wing-nut/hanger-spike combination,The squirrels loved this log but I could not give it five stars because the wing nut is too big for the hanger-spike. It keeps falling off and getting lost in the grass.
4,"Interesting perspective, but beware pomo lingo","If phrases like ""always already absent"" and references to how ""Japan had assimilated the alterity of the other"" appeal to you, then you will love this book.But once you get past his trendy lingo, Igarashi has some compelling things to say about postwar Japan and how it has effectively supressed its war responsibility in modern Japanese consciousness. I particularly enjoyed his discussion of the Tokyo OlympicsWhile I would not consider this ""history writing at its best"" (see John Dower for that), I do feel the book is a welcome, if at times tiresome, addition to Japanese history studies."
4,I rated this 4 stars because:,I have this Dortmund Germany concert on a 2 dvd set that I bought online and it has some audio problems but it still sounds goodfrom a transfer of a show called Pop/Rock that has Ozzy Osbourne and The Scorpions and a few other performers on it and I think it's out of printbut I'm gonna buy this one now because I think the sound and video have been improved upon compared to the one that I have that I will not now sellit looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape.at the beginning because there are some tape lines in it where the image wiggles a bit but I noticed thedvd does this also but it's excellent footage at Dortmund before Janick Gers joined the group and when Maiden were young and hungry.
4,Vintage Iron Maiden !!!,"Both DVDs are packed with their own stuff, the first basically has the concerts. They are decent quality considering how old they are, but they are still cool. Disc 2 has a couple of documentaries, its cool to see how Iron Maiden came to be, and to see some of the old members and how OLD they really look.The ONLY thing I didnt like was that they play a lot of the same stuff in 2 of the concerts, they are almost the same, I just wish they played Strange World live in one of those sets, would have been awesome !!!!"
5,Everything for the casual fan to the harcore army,"This, simply, has it all - whether you are a casual fan or a more hardcore follower. I remember watching ""Live at the Rainbow"" when it was shown on Nickelodeon back in the early 80s (it was among the first of the home video concert releases. That was a jewel for me, because it was my first experience seeing Iron Maiden - on TV when I was 12. I'm more than a casual fan, but not quite the full-on devotee of all things Maiden...and this DVD is everything I love about them."
5,Where's Part 2 ???,Where's Part 2 ???This DVD package is too good not to have a part 2.I hope the band is planning to continue with a part 2...
4,Honda Odyssey Dash Kit,This worked well in my Odyssey. Looks like it came with the car. Good value for the price.
3,Arione review,"I have a Brooks B-17 for long rides but needed a race saddle. Found the arione a little narrow and hard but it does ok for 50 to 8ok road races. Butt is a little sore after, so hopeing it breaks in after a few weeks."
5,"Great ""home-remedies",This is both an amusing and useful book for those of us trying to garden the green way. I've tried a few of the recipes with success!
2,Kinda cute but....,"Many of the ideas are little more than old spouse's tales. Regarding some of the pest control methods, please see this paper: http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&context=vpc14"
3,It has some good tips,"The book did have some useful tips. I felt that she used some scare tactics in order to get her point across about doing things more naturally. She mentioned her sources but I kept wondering if some of the things she mentioned were a one time thing or if they were really potentially harmful (ie: chemicals and such). Like I mentioned, the book does have some useful tips and I learned a couple of things that I didn't already know."
3,Not so solid,"They need to work on their delivery more, they seem to have unique beats, which i do like somewhat, yet their delivery is all the same, harsh and sounds like they tryn to hard, at any rate okay album, not one i would have bought unless my friend had made me, try it out, i aint gone hurt you"
5,Definitive Jux does it again,"""Cold Vein"" was a hot cd. The ""Fword"" was one of the best tracks, along with ""A b-boys alpha"""
3,Well..,"The beats are gross! I tried letting them ""grow on me"" but I couldn't. Theres only like one song on here that has a decent beat.The lyrics however are a different story. The lyrics are AWESOME."
4,"""Hypnotic""","Within A world of dark undertones and ""Vast"" DestructionCannibal Ox Lyrically breaks the earth's wicked coreCreating poetic thought's, and verbal seditives as a true solution for the ""Cold Vein""...Listen to there Lyric's, and adjust your ears to forget about the rythem.Then you will hear exactly why I rated this albulmfour star's..Melodic Records"
5,The Gritty NY City,"Vast Aire and Vordoul's styles back each other up, with each one having a flair that keeps you listening. They compliment each other so well, with Megilah right on point, while Kramer slows it down to show you the point. Each track on this CD is a classic, and they are never offbeat or commercial. These are not your average rappers; the independent duo aren't out for cash money or the bling bling. Their lyrics hit sharp with each bar, and EL-P shows his skills with the best production I've seen and heard since Rza and the 36 Chambers. For years, there has not been any breakthrough rap artists, but when you hear the lyrics of this CD, it speaks for itself. There's nothing like it, and I'm sure Can Ox will continue, because a legacy can't end like this. This album shows their solo skills since they left the Atoms Fam and Centa of da Web, which are some of the sickest underground groups out there."
3,"Very good, but not original","There were some wonderful things done by Glen Gray and his Casa Loma Orchestra, and sad to say, some have not yet been released on CD's. I like the cuts on this album, but was carelessly enthusiastic when I ordered it. I didn't think to check on the label. Capitol was all the re-recordings Gray did in the 50's and 60's. While wonderful sonically, they are in no way as incredibly special as the originals which MCA (Decca) has not yet released. This is a crime, as the LP version of ""The Best of Glen Gray"" is a beautiful job of remastering and the results are really terrific. As old as they are ('30's), the originals are excellent. Next time, I'll be careful to avoid the Capitol recordings, and make sure it's the original Decca material. There's nothing like an original. Everything after that is usually an inferior immitation."
5,Great read,"Well written, early (1954) history of the channel Islands. Written during the pre-national parks designations, so a really interesting insight into what was going own in the islands at the time, as well as the pre-, and early history of the respective islands.....all of them. The author travelled to each island with special permission from the military and land owners, and the maps and photographs are just the ones one would want to interpret the text.The story of the last indigenous Indian on one of the islands (which was made into a Disney film, but is begging for a more contemporary treatment) is so incredible as not to be believed, but true.If like me you grew up in S. CA & looked out on the distant Santa Barbara, Anacapa or other islands and wondered what they were all about, the is your book."
4,"Bugskull - 'Distracted Snowflake, Volume Two' (Scratch Records)","Looks to be Bugskull's fourth CD release. Interesting: Bugskull was reportedly started as a solo project some years back by Sean Byrne (Count Five guitarist). It's noted inside the disc's front cover that Byrne wrote and performed on all eight songs here. Can't believe this title can be bought for SUCH a low price. It's well worth ordering. Tracks I couldn't get enough of were the droning opener ""Charmed Life"", the (sort of) space tripping nine-minute adventurous ""Broke Like A Ghost (Ice Ace Blues)"", ""West Coastin'"" and the title cut ""Distracted Snowflake"". Personnel: Sean Bryne-guitar, Phil Q.-slide guitar, Mark H.-organ, bass & moog synthesizer and James Y.-drums. Recommended."
1,Throw your money away,"I was drawn to the sleek design and thought the price wasn't bad either. I bought it for my office where it doesn't get much use (until after business hours). I am constantly fighting with static and station reception and have had to hang the antenna wires all over everything for a clear signal. Now, at about 8 months, the CD player has completely stopped working. This unit no longer reads, recognizes or plays any CD's not matter what I do. So, now I own a nice looking, static playing radio that if you're not careful will trip you up in it's antenna wires."
4,exactly what I wanted except for volume settings,"This is a great stereo for a great price- I am very pleased with it and I found that most of the reviews here were very useful and accurate.One thing that I was not expecting but that you should be aware of before purchasing is that the volume changes in preset intervals and there is a big gap between the lowest audible setting and mute - so that if you enjoy listening to music/radio very softly, such as when you fall asleep, you may wish to consider a different system or set it up in an adjacent room. (I lean books up against the speakers when needed)"
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I received this stereo as a gift a few years ago. We rarely use it because:-The remote stopped working after a month-Radio reception is poor-CD's skip constantly or there is the ""No Disk"" error-Volume #2 is way too loud for quiet meals or falling asleep to ( we've moved with it may times) and volume #1 sounds like it is no longer playing in stereo."
1,you don't even get what you pay for,"This unit is not very good at all. I purchased it because of the sleek design and fact that you could hang it on the wall. This system is only 10 watts. If you are a casual radio listener and don't have to crank it up, then 10 watts may be enough player. The CD player skips a lot. It doesn't handle slightly scratched cds well. It will freeze up and stop if you try to scan through the tracks too quickly. I've continually had a problem with the remote. The power button on the remote does not work. And of course my unit is just over a year old, right out of warranty. I've changed the battery on the remote already. A new remote off the site costs $45. I paid only $80 for the system. Save your money and do not buy this system. You will not be pleased."
4,Philips MC 235 Stereo System,We bought it for use by my wife in her hobby room. Excellent sound-great product!
2,Pointless in the dark...,"Great look, good sound - so if you are just using this as a radio and/or CD player then fine. But I was trying to use it also as my nightstand CD/Clock Radio - but the clock is only displayed when the unit is in ""Standby Mode"", which is fine, but in Standby Mode, the blue LED light turns off, so using this unit as a CD/clock radio is pointless. You can't see the clock unless it is daytime or you have a light on in the room, so what's the point of having a clock on this unit. Stupid flaw. Tried to talke to the 888-Philips helpdesk - their even more useless and stupid. Like talking to a bring wall. Returned this unit within 5 days."
1,Bad radio reception and staticky noise from CD's,"I got this unit from Walmart yesterday for around $70. It looks decent, but its sound quality, both from radio and CD, is so inferior and I don't think it's worth the money. Also the remote buttons are really hard to push down. I'm returning it tomorrow."
3,No EQ,"Great looking, good reception, cd performance, decent sounding but glaringly lacking a tone control. Only tone adjustment is a dynamic bass boost button"
1,Word's can't explain how bad,"This is one of the most disappointing purchases that I've ever made. The first day out the box the cd player started to skip, I figured maybe it was the cd, so I put in a cd that was brand and needless to say it skipped. I was so pissed. On top of that the nearly microscopic screen at the top came broken, it only displayed portions of the track numbers & time which drove me nuts. I couldn't get the AM/FM player to work at all, even after bringing it in to Circuit City and getting another one.The look is gorgeous & its very compact which makes great for storage or lack of space, but its embarrasingly awful. I couldn't believe that Philips would put its name on such a useless product. Don't be fooled by the modern design, its a piece of crap"
4,"Great for the casual listener, but not for an audiophile.","This is exactly what I was looking for. Its clean sound (at a moderate volume) is as beautiful as its modern looks. It doesn't have a lot of options for Equalizing, just a few presets like jazz, rock or classic. The face can be a little difficult to read from a distance and the laser seems somewhat sensitive to fingerprints and imperfections on the disc. Overall It's a great stereo for the price. Delivery from the seller was very slow, however, and the product was not shipped until I bugged them several times. Luckily, the product arrived right before Christmas and the gift was very well received."
1,Broken after 30 seconds,"We went to Circuit City and bought a Phillips MC235, brought it home, and set it up. We bought this unit for its sleek design and space saving abilities. The first disc played a song for 30 seconds before stopping playback, spinning the disc clockwise then counterclock wise, then stopped all together with an ERROR, then NO DISC error. This is an under $80.00 paperweight. All looks, no functionality. We are returning this unit to the store and buying a nice console unit. Brand - new out of the box - it broke! If you want a stereo that looks cool but you don't need it to playback CD's, then this is the unit for you! When your friends come over show off how cool the unit looks, but when they want to hear it in action, change the subject and go out for tacos. It broke within 30 seconds of taking it out of its factory sealed box. 30 seconds - that must be some kind of record."
2,4 years later...you get what you pay for.,"We got this unit 4 years ago. The antenna does not work very well, never did (we like to listen the radio). The cd works but a lot of disks that play fine in the new truck skip on this unit. We don't use the remote feature. The sound is quit decent and has a couple of preset modes like ""jazz"" ""rock"" etc. The mounting hardware was terrible, had to rig it so that could be mounted. Weird. It is not ""thin ""like they show in the photos, it is about 4"" deep. The speaker wire is very short, so had to splice on longer wire. The speakers do not have a way to hang them, so I rig them by attaching a hook and hung them from the ceiling. But it still works after 4 years so I guess its ok. Shopping now for a new one that has a good antenna."
3,Cool look but cheap & poor user interface,"I bought this item from Walmart about 3 wks ago, the cd loader is slow and makes a lot of noise. Take a while to read and play CD too. Not as compact as i thought it would be. The look is cool but comes with cheap design, the speakers attached poorly to the main part. The ""STOP"" button on my controller wont work anymore. I'm taking it back to walmart this weekend."
3,Decent system for the money but beware of the remote,"Unlike some of the other problems with the system that others have mentioned, my problem has nothing to do with sound quality. It's actually a nice little system if you're just a regular person using it to play CDs around the house and not a looking for some extreme sound quality. The problem that i have is that after a year the remote stopped working. Yes, I changed the battery and did other trouble shooting, but to no avail, the remote doesn't work anymore. I went on Philips website and you can get a replacement remote for $45, but that costs almost as much as I paid for the system itself. In other words, if you're looking for a low-cost stereo that's functional, this is a good system. However, note that with its low cost, parts are not likely to last."
1,This video is not for the beginner.,"I thought this video would help me start learning to hear and speak Spanish. I was expecting to see and hear some English words in order to relate to the Spanish words. There might be some later on in the tape, but I couldn't understand lessons 1 and 2 so I thought it useless to continue. This tape might be ok for the student who knows Spanish and wants to increase his/her vocabulary. However, I wouldn't know that because I didn't understand anything.PhD, Solid State Physics"
5,It's about time!,"For internet and investment novices like myself, this book is golden! Helpful, simple, step-by-step instructions put me on a level playing field with the Big Boys. I can't wait to get started!"
3,"OK on DVD-A, better on SACD","I agree with David, the previous reviewer: the sound quality of this DVD-A is disappointing (""Flat""). Last year's SACD sounds better (and to think I bought this DVD-A because I was slightly dissappointed with the sound quality of the SACD to begin with). DVD-A is an awesome format, but do skip this title. Buy the SACD instead. It may not have the three music videos, but it does have two bonus tracks that are not included on the DVD-A."
3,Good but...,not one of Sting's best albums. The CD's standout song is the duet between he and Mary J. Blige. Their Grammy win was much deserved.
4,Very fun book!,I thought that this book was very cute. It didn't take me very long to read becuase I really enjoyed reading it. I would not recommend this book to a tom-boy because this is a very girly book.
4,Watch out! If you already have Putumayo World Christmas...,"If you already have Putumayo World Christmas, four of the 12 songs on this album are duplicates from that album. I don't understand why they released another Christmas album while the other one was still available if they weren't going to put all new songs on it.That said, this is a great album. It's a ton of fun to hear songs from around the world about Christmas and a really good variety of songs from different areas."
3,Duplication and too much traditionals,"If you love world music, you're going to love Putomayo. If you don't know world music and want to learn, this label is an excellent start. They provide you with just a taste of a variety of songs.Christmas Around the World takes you from Haiti to France and back again. You get:Haiti--1 songUSA--4 songsCuba--3 songsBarbados--1 songFrance--1 songMartinique--1 songIt's a nice flavoring of all kinds of music and sounds.If you have Putomayo's World Christmas, you have 1/3 of this CD. If you are looking for different Christmas music, this is mostly world covers of traditional Christmas music.Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
3,Christmas Around The Block,"Putumayo has earned a deservedly fine reputation for offering unusual and eclectic music from various corners of the world, so this CD is something of a disappointment. Eleven of the twelve cuts are from North America, and of those, seven are from the Caribbean and four from the US. Only three languages are represented; English, French and Spanish. They could, and should, have cast a wider net. I should also mention that it runs to only about 38 minutes. Having said that, the quality of the artists and recordings is good and so, in its limited way, it is an enjoyable CD."
1,a billion the hard way by louie attebery,This books title promises so much more than it delivers....An extremely disappointing bio....lacks detail....we want to know how j.r. does business....this book won't give you any insight...dull reading....one of the first times i've read a book about a business leader that provided no personal insight into how this person does what he does....or thinks the way he does....too bad !! j.r. seems like a cool dude...would have liked to get to know him....!
1,First Became a Millionaire by WWII Contracts,"What has Mr. Simplot done for veterans, in Idaho, especially, and nationwide?Surely a man of his reputation, character, and background would want to leave a clear, well-defined legacy of 'giving back' to those tens of thousands of young American soldiers, sailors, and airmen whose blood paved the way for his early fortune and established his company.Surely his family line will want 'returning a debt to veterans' to be prominent on his historical record?"
4,The simplest approach to frequent grammar issues,This book provides help to solve frequent grammar questions. Your writing style will improve considerably if you apply the guidelines
5,Great resource for independent learners.,"My students work full time and don't have a lot of time or energy to do grammar exercises at home. They want fast answers that are easy to understand. I recommend this book for the clear explanations and convenient format, and students have always found it accessible. Well worth the investment--you'll use it as much as your dictionary at least!"
5,Marvelous web site by Jane Straus,"For anyone who wants to hone their grammar skills, this is an absolutely wonderful web site. I never knew anything like it existed and am so happy I've found it. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about being grammatically correct when writing or speaking. It's quite obious that Ms. Straus cares about the English language and doesn't want proper English to disappear. How refreshing!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book based on its glowing reviews -- hoping to use it as part of my grammar lessons with my children who are homeschooled. Needless to say, I was disappointed. It is not a grammar book for children. The subject content of some of the sentences were not appropriate and I found that it only deals with business situations, it is not a classroom textbook. In my personal opinion, it is not homeschool grammar material."
2,Impractical,"I have read this book cover to cover. Its motivational but really impractical. This books makes a lot of assumptions that are untrue. The book claim's to be ""scientifically"" applied. There is not one single reference to any psychological or ""scientific"" method outlined in this book. Its just the same theme that is harped by 1000s of book in the same genre. The bottom line is practice what you preach. If the author claims to be such an authority on seducing women. How come I've never heard of him in the media?"
2,Don't read about it...just go out and make it happen,Don't spend too much money on these books...just go out and go for it.
3,Rambling,"I could not finish this book. It is well written and in parts laugh-out-loud funny but the plot was too rambling for me. As the previous reviewer said, membership in the tribe may contribute to one's enjoyment - as a non-tribe member, much of the book was lost on me. I debated as to whether or not I should keep reading, but finally decided to give up. I have a feeling that had the subject matter been anything else, I'd have liked this book as I enjoyed his use of words. But that's like saying I'd like chocolate ice cream if it wasn't chocolate."
1,Membership in the tribe (or honorary membership) may be necessary to absorb its full impact.,"The reviewer that said the title of this review hit the nail on the head. It is difficult for me, a non-tribe member, to see how even a tribe member could like this book. Full of words, stories, jokes, stories and prose boring to this tribal outsider. It should be noted that I could not and did not finish this painful book. Perhaps it has some redeeming features in later parts of the book. Non-tribal members should read ""The Invisible Bridge,"" ""Sarah's Key,"" ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" ""The History of Love,"" or other quality fiction with tribal content for much better experiences.My main complaint is that I was not alerted to the nature of this book before I wasted my money. My bad."
3,Not much help,I found the guide to FF5 superficial at best. There is info on characters' abilities and stats. The guide doesn't tell you where to find weapons/items/magic and doesn't give you a good world map. You can find all the info you need on the internet. Don't waste your money.
2,It spends to much time explaining the easy stuff.,If found this guide very superficial. It's amazing that in Japan they have about 400 pages doveted to FFV alone while we get about 240 superficial pages for both 5 and 6. This book answers all the easy questions but is vague on many things that it should give more detail for. The beasitary is terrible for FFV. But what are you gonna do? This is the only guide available
1,Bad quality item,"About the quality of the edition only.Academic Press has done it again: charge you more than 100$ for a crappy book. That is, very bad quality printing, the text seems like if scanned first and then printed in a laser wich gives it a piggy typeface, to complement this the pages are glued instead of sewn. Very well done, overall quality and durability of a cheap paperback for only 115$."
2,Beware,"First of all the content adresses the subject well and it isuseful for someone in quantum electrodynamics. Similarinformation has been given in other books.HOWEVER.... I have to agree with the last reviewer. This bookseems to be a copy of the original book, even though cleanlydone ! ...outside cover cheaply printed on spine, no front print,inside pages are photocopies and not original quality pressprinting !!!! In all, it looks like a well done black market copyrather than an original Academic Press book.BEWARE of buying this version. Other sources might berecommended."
4,Still Applicable (mostly) for SO 5.2,"I agree that this is the most comprehensive review of 5.1. I use both 5.1 and 5.2, and this is in the main, applicable for 5.2 users. The included Adabas makes the database much better. Staroffice is not the only suite for Linux/FreeBSD, there is also Applixware. I like both. I only give it 4 stars because of the lack of the coverage of the new database."
1,Need advice,This book won't help me at all - I want to be able to write Macros which requires knowledge of starbasic and import spreadsheets into html. Where can I get this kind of information? Is anything written - in English?
3,"Entertaining, but - huh?","Writing style is interesting, the mood is dark and scary and defininely Lovecraftian, but the characters were a little sparse. Maybe I'm too black and white, but the whole book left me thinking, ""What just happened here?"""
2,A major letdown.,"I've now read 3 books by Caitlin. The first, Silk, was a blurry, scattered mess. It was also her first book, and read like it. The one I had recommended to me was Daughter of the Hounds. I read that, and it was so good, I even thought about giving Silk a little more leeway. Then I read Threshold.It starts out favorably enough. It keeps on going steadily, sometimes more interesting, sometimes less, but mostly building up tension towards what seems more and more like a good payoff.Then, in either a lack of ideas on how to end the story, or in a desire to be really ambiguous (I would vote the first one), it descends into surrealist nonsense. Some of the earlier story makes little sense, and some of it is actually cringe inducing. Then, it ends. Just like that. No explanations. No resolution. Just a vague attempt at implying that something important happened. I felt cheated. I spent my time, and invested my interest, in a book that ended up going nowhere and wasting my time"
3,Confusion,"I don't understand some of what I just read. I like the scary, creepy writing but I just couldn't connect everything and why some characters did what they did. I will read another of her writings."
4,Threshold,Great character development and deep story telling make this a great book to read alone and with just enough light to read by. Get it now!
1,some stories never end,"When I ordered this book I was quite looking forward to what sounding like a very interesting read. Then the book came and I read it. Even if you don't mind the constant present-tense (which I am not comfortable with) there is still the major drawback that it essentially doesn't end. After 240 or so pages of build-up it appears that some form of time travel is used to negate 90% of the story leaving the central problem untouched. The characters tended to be rather shallow, the story its self was haphazard at best and the ending highly unsatisfying. I would only recommend this book if you have no other option."
5,This book is the bomb!,"No kidding, Kiernan is hot, hot, hot. I loved her first book, Silk, but Threshold was more exciting and a lot scarier. The ending took me totally by surprise, and that's good because I hate horror stories where I can see the ending coming from a mile away. You definitely can't say that about Threshold! I can't wait for her next novel."
3,An annoying headache!,"I read this book. Actually, I tried to read this book. Several times. Each time I had to stop because my brain was going to explode from the complete lack of coherency in her writing. The problem with the book is the writing,the use of half-page long sentences with fused adjectives makes for a boring read. The characters are flat, the plot weak and the end is worse. But, this is her second novel so I won't give it a really bad rating. A lot of people like her style of writing but the long sentences makes the action ""molassesquick."" If you want to read this book find it in used bookstore or the library. Don't spend your cash on it."
3,Sophmore Novel,"Being a fan of Poppy Z. Brite, Dean Koontz and Caitlin R. Kiernan, I was thrilled when I found that Kiernan had recently published a new novel. I bought it, read it, and sat back to digest. I re-read Silk by Kiernan and discovered that I enjoyed her first novel (with its amazing writing and fantastic characters) a lot more than Threshold.The ending in Threshold was a disappointment and the characters were not as developed.I was expecting more."
1,Dry and Dated,A rather dated look at Japan's JET Programme. A few interesting facts and shallow gossip from the early days of the programme but nothing truly worthwile.
3,Importing Diversity - A Good Inside Look at the JET Program,"McConnell's book gives you a good behind the scenes look at the JET Program during its early years. It would have been nice if McConnell would have provided more depth than breadth, but his research does give you a good look at the program through the eyes of the national government, local officials, and JET participants. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a study of the JET Program from an anthropoligical perspective."
3,Beware that this is a history book!,"I currently live in Japan and know many JETs. I'm not too sure who the audience for this book is. If you want to know the current and future state of the JET program, you are not the audience. If you were in the JET program in 1988 or 1989 this would probably be good nostalgic material for you to reminisce over and laugh about. I don't question its accuracy and much of it is interesting to read (kind of like gossip because it focuses on mostly negative and sensational aspects of JET participants' experiences in Japan), but for most people I think it is just a reference book for when you need to know what happened back in the late 80s. If you are a prospective JET, I recommend that you talk to former JETs who were recently in Japan."
3,"Not bad for teen-agers, I guess.","The book treats us to a simplistic future world, characters with no complications, ultra-smart super-kids without the ""smart"" and the ""super"", and the WORST set of clues left by a bad guy EVER."
4,GRAY? Balding? Both?,"Here is a good, ""quick and dirty"" daily solution for graying/balding. I use it daily on my hairbrush for my beard. It works, and has worked for several years."
2,"Overpriced, uninformative","My expectation of what this book was when I was purchasing, and the reality of it were completely at odds.I did not purchase this book for a class, but instead got it out of personal curiosity. For the $40 that I paid, I expected much more: the book provides only formulas that are grouped by an ontology, but lacks completely any derivation, motivation, or explanation of the equations and symbols used.For a student looking to learn physics, this is not the book for you. For a researcher looking for a reference, this is overpriced and contains only trivial formulations."
3,old school,The nice thing about NiMH batteries is that you don't have to wait until they fully discharge to recharge them. The bad thing about this charger is that it only has one way of charging - 15 hours straight then it shuts off. Take my advice and get a charger that knows when to quit (then trickle charges while it waits for you).
3,Not what I expected,"After reading the reviews on this item, I ordered it as it was supposed to charge nimh batteries in 5 hours. The unit I received takes 15 hours to charge the batteries. Don't get me wrong, this is a good charger but I expected to get the fast charger, not one that takes overnight to fully charge batteries."
1,Please Answer the Question,"In Xai Li's review of 10/14/02, he/she asked if this batterycharger can be used to charge an AA or similar ALKALINE batter-ies. I have yet to see an answer."
4,Takes you back doesn't it.,From a time when songs were songs this CD contains some of the music that made the 80's the great decade of music it was.From the original Power of love by Jennifer Rush to Phil Collins classic love songs you will have memories flooding back when you listern to this wonderfully mastered collection of classics!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
2,A WASTE OF TIME,"This movie was a mere shadow of its legendary predescesor. Not only did it lack the humor and heart that made the first movie so great, but the ending simply recycled the climax of part one, which I thought was one of the most suspensful moments in movie history. Also, Leonard Maltin said it had ' considerable inginuity ' HA! The future hill valley is a rip-off of blade runner, the awesome way the wheels on the De Lorean flip up is another bit of recycled footage, and the jigsaw-like plot will turn your brains to pudding. On a more positive note, the acting is great and I'm glad they kept the original cast."
2,Not Memorable for the right reasons,"This just isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone unless they just wanted to watch the whole Back to the Future trilogy to say they had. This was the worst of the three movies in my opinion. I am not critizting the acting of Michael J. Fox or Christopher Lloyd, as they were great as usual, but they weren't given a whole lot to work with in this film.I am sure that after a few months pass that I wouldn't be able to tell you much about this movie. I would remember only that the characters traveled into an alternate present. This movie just isn't one that will stick with me for any other reason than that it was the second in an otherwise great set of stories.Watch it only for the sake of seeing all three in the series."
1,Miss it.,"Much too clever for it's own good, this film is a pyrotechnical shambles that lets down the reputation of the original."
3,Not that good,"Not that good like part one, but still a classic movie.Funny to see what they thought how 2014 will look like."
4,Antics run high,"Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson gave an entertaining watch in this sequel to the Back To The Future franchise. Robert Zemeckis embraces the fun and the antics and I really enjoy his ability to tell a story."
4,Great Sequel but drags on,"This sequel starts off wonderful, the future scenes are amazing, considering that this is 1989 that this is made, computer technology still at it's beginning stages, the things they did were amazing, especially when things on computers were really limited. The thing is that the movie, although being good is 143 minutes, over 2 hours and it does seem longer if you watch all at once. Some great things are done in this film, it is truly amazing how they did this film. Both beginnings of part 2 and 3 were shot during the filming of the first movie, because Zemeckis always had a trilogy planned, that takes a lot of guts and talent because something could of happened to Michael J. Fox or some other star during the those years, but again Zemeckis is talented and part 2 shows that, great direction in this movie and great CGI for 1989."
5,the best of the best of the best,"i swear 5stars aren't enough for a film like this . the twists &turns of the film are so juicy &funny,you'll have to have a completely open mind while watching otherwise you'll get lost in time..the first & second BTTF's are both equally brilliant,but the third was weak.. honistly,the best movies ever made are back to the future & roger rabbit"
3,"Thumbs up, thumbs down.","The DeLorean's hover conversion system was especially unique, and so were the hoverboards. I also liked the way the moviemakers portrayed the future (2015) . But how come in the alternate 1985, another family was living in Marty's house instead of Marty and his family themselves? Like, how did an alternate family get there? There's quite a bit of bad language in the movie :( . And some violence. But other than that I guess it's a cool movie."
1,I Wish This Would go Away,"Back to the Future Part II (1989) *1/2 |C--107 min.| D: Robert Zemeckis. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, Charles Fleischer, Elijah Wood. PGUnbelievably dark and joyless, lacklustre, bad, dumb, big flop, head ache of a sequel to the 1985 classic sci-fi film BACK TO THE FUTURE. It's bad, with just awful loser characters and a plot so thick and confusing that it's like trying to walk in pudding up to your knees. It's a foggy plot with too many twists and inventions to be enjoyable. It truly is a generic sequel, with bad effects, bad acting, bad directing, and a hopeless screenplay. It's as if the filmmakers just kept adding and adding to the hopeless story without any rhyme or reason. It's boring too. Nothing at all is appealing in this film. The characters are for the most part mean and unlikable, with very few virtues. I do not like this Sam I Am, not one little bit."
2,A STUPID!!! sequel for a great original movie.,"The first one was a great classic but this one ruined the whole thing.""WHY?""because:. Many HORRIBLE actings.. Biff steals and travel the time machine.. The costumes of Marty's future family were cheap.. Very confusing.. Many stupid jokes except whem Marty was almost hit by a family that lives in his house.The only thing good were the ideas of how will be the year 2015.Syonara,adios,goodbye."
3,The worst of the trilogy.,"Yes, it's interesting. Yes, in the 2nd film we see the DeLorean more than in the others. They also travel very much. But there is a thing that all you seem to ignore: the logicality of the plot. What is a ""temporal kennel"" (I hope all you will understand what I mean. In the Italian version Doc leaves Einstein in a ""Canile Temporale"".) I thought they (Doc and Marty) were the only people able with ""time"". This is only one mistake... but I have found many others... Because of all this errors, I can't consider this second film as the Best of the Trilogy. I'm sorry."
3,DOES WHAT A TIME TRAVEL MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO DO,"This sequel of the superb ""Back To The Future"" is a very earnest attempt to follow a winning formula up with a truly worthwhile effort in this sequel. Complex, yes, but interesting. Unfortunately, at times it gets a bit too mechanically contrived with the time sequence derivations, and I find myself mentally checking the continuity which detracts from the theme. Nevertheless, if you liked the first ""Back To The Future"" you will probably enjoy this movie. All the characters are present from the original and they are playing multiple generations almost simultaneously. After all, isn't that what a time travel ovie is supposed to do?"
4,DVD and one of kind flick,The trilogy needs to be on DVD. I will buy it on DVD and it appears many others will too. What signal does it take to put this on DVD. Fascinating storyline is worth watching the scenes from first flick from a different point of view. Figuring out the movie is fun too. Not at all comic but it adds something special to the triology. The first one has magic and comedy and the last one has a romance and comedy.
4,Back 2 the future 2,Remember watching these films growing up. Considering the film takes place in 2016 pretty funny to see how people thought the future would be.
4,Back to the future Fan,Daughter requested all the back to the future movies for xmas.we have not opened any of them up. packaging was ok and we hope they are all in good condition.
2,Horror Movie,"The scariest thing about this film is that the future will probably be just as shallow, confused, insulting, and commercialized as this movie actually is. If you can't tell the difference between this thing and the original you've already been infected! Welcome to your new world."
2,Must try harder,"This sequel to the original Back to the Future is far to complicated for its own good. If you get distracted for more than two seconds you have lost the thread.Back to the Future 1 was briliant, as was number three, but number two served merely to link the other two together.Save for the special effects that allowed Marty to see himself I cannot recomend this one.Bad as it was, the cast cannot be blamed for it, they all worked their hearts out."
1,"The kids thought this was dumb, so we turned it off.","The kids thought this was dumb, so we turned it off. That about says it all...We really enjoyed the first one, though."
4,Fun continuation...,"This second installment to the trilogy continues the story effectively sending Marty to 2015, then back to 1985, then back to 1955 all over again. While this one may be a little harder to follow, it is just as fun and comical as the first. Christopher Lloyd is tons of fun as Doc Brown and Michael J. Fox is great as Marty, future Marty, and Marty's son. Fox is a very talented actor and this movie showcases that talent effectively."
3,Sequel number one to one of my favorite movies of all time,"Sequels are never as good as the first. We all say it, we hear it. Well, it is true.But this movie is fun! Even if it is the most confusing of the series, jumping back and forth from the future, 2015, to the present, 1985, to the past, 1955. It leapfrogs all over the place.The futuristic sequences are great, I love Cafe 80's...I'm totally a huge 80's fan and product of the time and this movie brings me back...If you liked the first, you'll like this one..just as much fun. good family entertainment, despite a few swears here and there..it was rated PG!"
4,Inventive,"Unlike so many sequels intended for family movies, this vehicle never talks down to the audience or has a too thin plot--if anything it is too thick.Fox not only must go forward in time to save his kids from a gang arrest, but must go back into 1955 to regain a book that had been lifted from him by long time nemisis Biff. If he does not retrive the Sports Almanac from Biff, his 1985 presence will also be threatened by Biff's ""good fortune"".In an industry that has currently interpreted comedy as licence to make as many gross jokes as often as possible, the reunion of Fox and Lloyd reminds us that it is possible for people to be funny without resorting to crude humor.Fox is the usually likeable boy---and girl next door(he plays his daughter Marlene in the future segment)and even when his character does something really dumb or snaps at another character, the audience members cannot help but place themselves in his shoes."
3,Not as good as the first one!,This movie Back to the future 2 is kind of a mess but it is still good. The plot is a mess from the beginning. I like how they went into 2015 and how they see it at that time although I do think the writers could have done more with that plot. I say the down side came in the film where they have Biff mess up the movie by making the alternate 1985 with that stupit big hotel and making Hill Valley a dumphole. It's kind of sad to see it like that. Then they took this movie into 1955 again and that made it more crazy at times it is actually hard to believe that this plot came from such a fantastic first movie. Back to the future 2 is sorry at times and never lives up to the original or the 3rd. But is still good but could have been alot better.
3,Worst One of The Trilogy..,"This movie is the worst one of the trilogy. I dont know why but it just doesnt have the bttf make to it. It's still a good movie. But I won't spoil what happens, becuase then you won't have to watch it. So go rent it today."
4,At last!..............,"Have been looking for a copy of this CD for a long time for my son, who has special needs and has asked for it for years.Any that I did find, were at ridiculous prices. This was a second hand purchase, at a high rate for a CD, but much lowerthan was advertised elsewhere.The music is very good and with a couple of really catchy tunes. Anyone who has seen and enoyed this film will enjoy the music on theCD."
2,Textbook,"This book is useful for my class, but it is difficult to understand if you haven't taken speech classes prior to reading this."
5,Wonderful and informative text.,"I would recommend this text to all speech-language pathologists, OTs, PTs, parents, educators and anyone who works with children who use AAC devices."
3,Lots of info in a wierd order makes it hard to understand,As a student currently using this book I have to say I don't like it. My class has followed this book chapter by chapter so far and it makes absolutly no sense. I'm almost through with the semester and we are just getting into configurations! (Which would have been helpful knowing about three chapters!) The book has a lot of good information if you can understand it. Or if you are like me you have someone explain it to you.
1,Ipod Nano Fm Transmitter-wht,I did not want to rate this item but the review wouldn't allow no rating. This was the only thing my daughter wanted for Christmas; however the product was supposed to be for the Nano but did not fit it so I had to return it. I have yet to find a replacement.
5,Love it,"Using itunes to put music on the nano is easy and quick. If you want to use it primarily for listening to music or podcasts the nano is great. The nano is smaller in size than the ipod, and the screen may not be as good for viewing pictures. It now comes in many colors, so you don't have to settle for choosing between black and white, as I did. Many accessories are available for the nano,too."
1,a promising start but....,"the sirius mystery begins as a truly interesting search for answers to the seemingly unexplainable scenario of how an african people can have known for thousands of years very specific information about our solar system as well as the sirius star system. however, while it has a great start, the argument quickly loses its focus as it goes off on long tangents and spends chapter after chapter discussing minor details rather than deal with the heart of the subject. temple's ""evidence"" frequently stretches the facts very thin and often seems irrevelant. throughout the book, the author is also very self-promoting which detracts from the ideas he proposes. so overall while it had a very promising start and the topic is one for further examination, this book is not a worthwhile read."
2,Disappointing & Superficial,"I had higher hopes for this one. In actuality it is a highly superficially written book, which, except for the major story of Dogon's cosmology, contains little material analysis and argumentation for the main hypothesis offered. Especially the word ""scientific"" seems to be highly out of place in the title. If you like Hancock's writing, or similar paleo-archaeology stuff, this book will bring you quite some disappointment."
1,Did not address the subject matter,"To be perfectly honest, this book was a big disappointment. The book never addressed the issue of what was the NEW scientific evidence? After forcing myself to finish the book, I still didn't learn anything new. This book is a big waste of money and an even bigger waste of time."
3,a piece of the puzzle,"The book ,which was a gift so only skimmed, seemed too full of scientific terms and names not adequately explained in the first two chapters. It was dull for this engineer who is not an astronomer. Chapter three perks up and gets intresting and into the subject---so stay at it. The concept dove tails beautifully with some current programning on the history channel. The book fits nicely with many current and original theorists like Von Doiniken(sp) and contempories."
3,Kind of funny,"I usually love books like this. But it seems like half the book was spent bashing scientists and with strange paranoid delusions about the CIA out to get him. It could have been a good book besides these interruptions and the same information over and over and over and over. I mean, seriously. It was disorganized and honestly boring."
3,Rock a billy boy,"this is a very listenable album if you like Mel McDaniel you will like this album ""Blue Suede Shooes"" is not on the album the coreect title is ""Blue SuedeBlues which is defenitly the best song on the album and should have been a big hit it was a single"
4,A very practical guide,"I've purchased several copies of this text because is is incredibly useful as a bridge from basic theory learnt by undergraduates to practical hardware. Those who want a detailed reference for low noise amplifiers or phase lock loops will be disappointed, but those who want enough information to build and understand their *first* low noise amp or their *first* PLL or their *first* mixer, are well advised to pick up Hagen's very useful book.My only criticism is that I would have preferred the PLL or amplifier material to be contigious, rather than the ""revisiting"" approach selected by the author. This is a minor complaint."
1,Do not buy,"Book tries to cover all the important topics but is terribly lacking in details, the derivations are sketchy and sometimes unclear, and too much disparate knowledge is assumed of the reader. I cannot believe they use this book in a sophomore or junior level class."
2,Confusing,"I use this book as the standard text of my RF course at Cornell. Honestly, this book is only for casual reading.Though it covers many topics, but all of them lack in details. For instance, it use 10 pages to explain class A and B amplifier. After reading that 10 pages, I still didn't understand why they are named class A and B. While dealing with modulation, no mathematical details is provided (Does the author assume that we already understand that?) After all, I don't feel this book to be a textbook. The way it treats RF is like a computer magazine treats computer architecture. You learn there are CPU and RAM in a computer from the magazine, but you never learn how to build a CPU or RAM. You can't even learn how to build a full bit adder from it."
1,"Wow, its that bad","This is the second book I have ever reviewed, and only the second book I have felt the need to. You look over the reviews some good some bad, and think, hey I'll try it out. Well let me tell you don't. The book just has no real coherence. It has horrible illegible graphs, no schematics of circuits it actually talks about, and no explanations of the circuits it discusses. It is more a useful tidbit book, if you already knew everything in the book, it might give you a little extra. But man, the amount of information given is near zero if you don't know what's going on."
1,Radio-Frequency Electronics,"It seems that the author trying to show how knowledgeable he is on the subject RF electronics. But on a reader or a student's point of view, I had learnt little from this book. The book gave only superficial views, although it covers a wide area of subjects of RF. It's not a good book for students. So don't buy this book, buy others. Or even a dictionary of electronics would give you more things to learn about RF electronics."
5,Lizzy,"Although I am not a teenager I found this book very helpful (I did have to go on line to calculate my bmi, however). I didn't want to go on a fad diet, and I wanted to read something in an interesting format. This book teaches you to eat healthy for life and most importantly it helps you understand portion sizes. Unlike so many fad diets, it gives you the knowledge you need to make wise choices in the real world of food and drink (what to do when faced w/a plate of cookies?).The format is easy to read and understand. Again, I am not a teenager, but a young Mom. It has helped me already lose 1/3 of my goal post-baby weight. It teaches you to eat healthy, eat healthy amounts, and have a healthy lifestyle (excercise, etc). I love the fact that it has several pages that give actual sized, color examples of the serving size of pizza, muffin, fruit, mac and cheese, etc. I have definitly used the pizza cut out several times!"
5,Awesome book about being heathy/fit for teenage girls!!,I bought this book for my 15 year old that was trying to get fit and eat healthier. She read the whole book in 1 night and she actually taught me some stuff. She has been following the book for almost 3 weeks now and I love it. She has learned about portion control and how many of each food group she should consume a day and it's about being fit!!It's a lifestyle. I could tell her stuff until I was blue in the face but this book was key for us. Highly recommend it!
2,Iv'e read better,"This book was pretty interesting and i liked the talk about how we should love our bodies. The only problem was that some of the information was off. The BMI charts were not accurate and did more harm than good. Also, the recipes were not as good and just didn't make much sense. I really did not learn anything from the book. It says it is okay for someone who doesn't want to lose weight and just wants to be healthy, but that didn't seem to be the case. It all seemed to be about weight loss and not so much as just being healthy and maintaining a solid weight. All in all, I was not particularly pleased with this book."
2,Too bad I don't live in LA,"While reading this book I'll admit I got a bit excited. But when you get down to it, they really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. I felt the diet plan was very ""LA-esque,"" the requirements of which I couldn't always meet in my NYC suburb. On top of that, a lot of their meal suggestions go against the new and updated food pyramid, and many of their recipes have A LOT of fat in them. Bottom line, there are better choices out there to learn how to eat healthily."
3,Umm ok?,The book is okay and I am a teen and I found the recipes disgusting! Hello? It made me want my junk food...badly
5,Great weight loss book!!!!,Years back when I was in middle school I was constantly struggling with my weight. I had tried everything but it all failed until I found this book. Immediately I read through and created my meal plans and let me tell you after 3 months I lost 35 pounds and actually kept it off!!! This was a amazing book and planning on using it again if I need to.
5,Good guide and nutrition reference,"The first non-threatening, basic book about body image and nutrition. Covers all of the basics: recipes, meal plans, nutrition education sections. Good for parents of small children for their own education."
4,Description Needs to Be Changed,Product seems okay... but the description listed here should be updated. There is only one speaker MOUNT included in the package--not MOUNTS as listed here.
3,Black Canisters,I love the look of the canisters. I just wish that they had been bigger or at least one more canister that was bigger.
3,Good But The Title Is Misleading,"This is a great CD for what it is-a collage of two of the three Shaft trilogy soundtrack scores;whether the company couldnt get the rights to the middle movie of the three,""Shaft's Big Score""I don't know,but to call this the best of Shatft without O.C.Smith's main theme from that movie ans a piece at the end that was called""Symphony For Shafted Souls""which appeared on the original vinyl soundtrack is an grave injustice.The O.C.title song IS available on CD however,here on Amazon.Com on a CD entitled ""Pimps,Players and Private Eyes""a blaxploitation afficinado's gem.Yes,buy this CD,but its not all it could have been."
5,J.Butler,"It's great. I could not find one in area stores, so I was very pleased to find it for sale on Amazon. It arrived in only a couple of days with no problems."
2,Where's the magic?,Where is the magic? This book is less about mysticism and magic and more about comic talking monkeys. It reads like Friend's episode! David Blaine offers 10x more magic than this universe. Even Marvel comes closer to touching the magic with Dr. Strange than this poorly thought out drivel.
2,Logic would help,"I read this because it was a Prelude to Infinite Crisis, but the story defies logic. The Spectre is known in the DC Universe as the spirit of Vengeance. He is all-powerful, and can see into your soul and view the evil person you are. So it defies logic that he decides to destroy all magic because Eclipso (the very definition of evil) tells him to.In truth, I never really understood why Eclipso wanted to destroy magic...other than to create chaos. I enjoyed reading about some of the lesser characters in the DC magical universe, and for me that includes the wizard Shazam and Captain Marvel. But the book is light on understanding those characters, and the ending definitely leaves you with little understanding as to what has just ocurred.I have not yet read Infinite Crisis, so maybe in retrospect it will make more sense. Unfortunately, I doubt it."
2,Horny Spectre,"I had high hopes for this series. I am a big fan of God's Wrath, but to make the Spectre a horny nut in 2 panels? and then go buck wild and destroy all magic without much reasoning in an instant was ludacris. I understand that the Spectre without a host is pretty much untamed, and that the human host is what helped him make judgments, but come on.....Eclipso took a female form and made Spectre go crazy once aroused. The only thing saving this book was a chimpanzee.....shows how exciting this book was."
5,Mind-Blowing,"I had discovered this fact-dense book while digging through the stacks in a local university library, in an effort to find any information on the American Protective League. I also found a book titled ""The Web"", which proclaimed itself to be the official account of the American Protective League activities. Not willing to get my information from an APL membe, given the nature of the APL, I began to read Jensen's book with the hope that she would provide an outside view looking in. Within a few pages I realized I had discovered a goldmine of information surrounding the political and psychological dynamics that led to the creation of this state-sponsored vigilante organization and what perpetuated its existence for several years. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone wishing to gain a glimpse of the darker side of American society that probably still exists today."
3,Get the BBC version instead,The version you want is the 1954 BBC radio recording with Richard Burton. You can buy it on Amazon.co.uk for about $... and they ship to the USA. It is available now as part of the BBC Radio Collection. Richard Burton's voice is astounding. This is a book about Wales and you should hear it spoken by a Welshman.Label: Decca - PopASIN: B000026NW6The BBC knocks most other radio drama producers into a cocked hat and has for 50 years.
4,A matter of taste,"My partner and I checked the different versions available in our public library first: one with Richard Burton narrating, one with Anthony Hopkins and Jonathon Pryce (currently listed on Amazon as ""various artists""), and one with Dylan Thomas himself. For us, the Hopkins/Pryce CD won by a narrow margin. We felt the voices were better overall - including all characters, not just the main narrators - though the music numbers seemed a bit overdone, not as natural as on the Burton CD. Burton came second for voice. I can't now remember anything particular about the Thomas CD, except that it didn't seem as good as the other two.My recommendation: Explore what you can before buying, and note that the characters will take over from the narrators more and more as the story goes on. If you care how the music is done, check that too. Hopkins/Pryce remains our favourite, but I am just about to buy the Burton as well, having decided that both deserve listening time ... again and again."
3,"Good For Voice, Bad for Live Music","FYI: This microphone is for voice/lectures only, or line in recording such as from a stereo, its not for live music. Audio I recorded with it was often mildly distorted. Also, battery life is only an hour. So its not a good choice for bootleggers."
3,Belkins Microphone F8Z082,I am not to happy with the recording with Belkins F8Z082. I telephoned the Tech support for help and I was told that this Belkin F8Z082 Microphone is not compatable with new Classic iPod. And I was told by Belkin's Tech support this item is only workable with Sterio iPod and not Classic iPod.
2,no go,"The thing broke without any hard use. When it worked, it wasn't anything special. It just broke, and I don't even know why. It didn't feel cheap, but I guess under the hood it is cheap. Do not get this; it is definitely not worth it."
4,Great.,This product works great for my purpose of recording loud rehearsals with my rock band for personal review and file sharing.
5,Does the job!,"This product does what it says it can do. My girlfriend has been using it for two weeks+ for a summer class. It has certainly worked well and has definitely aided her studying.The only drawback, if any, you need to ensure it has a full charge before each use and charge it after. She takes a 1 hour and 20 minute class 4x a week and it will get her a full lecture each time.Highly recommend!"
4,Skippy,"The recording is super clear!! But for some odd reason it skips every now and then. And when you are trying to record music that can get annoying because sometimes it skips right at a part you really wanted to listen to. I would never use this to make actual recordings of things, I just use it to record lectures and some music rehearsals.. it gets the job done... with skips..Also it kills your ipod battery.. so if you are going somewhere you'll be smart to bring your ipod charger :)"
4,Great Product!,"This product is a very handy recorder to have in compatibility with the iPod. Very user friendly. Upon attachment to the new Nanos an additional option opens in the main menu entitled ""voice memos"" where you can begin recording, change settings, and access all of the voice files that have been saved. Upon connection to your computer, iTunes will open and it will automatically transfer the voice files to your music library. The only downsides to this product are:1. The recorder has capability of turning ""autogain"" on. This picks up a significant amount of background noise. If you are recording a lecture, the presenter's voice will not be disrupted, but it is a bit annoying.2. 1 hour of lecture will suck almost 1/2 of your Nano's battery power. During days of 3 hour lectures, I have to sit close to an outlet so I can run the USB through my charging computer so the battery won't die. That's a hastle, but the quality of recording is great.Highly recommended!"
3,Picks up extraneous noises from ipod while recording,Hopefully there is some work still being done to fix the problem of recording the hisses and clicks from the ipod's mechanism while trying to record live from this device. A stereo mike on an arm or connection seperate from the Ipod. Or some other method to buffer the ipod's noises. However the stereo sound and clarity is excellent.
2,Power hog,"I bought this recorder module for the purpose of recording classes at a music symposium I attended this month. There were 5 daily classes from 9:00 - 5:30. I was surprised on the first day to see the iPod shut down halfway through the first class with a drained battery. I assumed that I hadn't charged the iPod fully, plugged it in during dinner and prepared for the next day. Sure enough, after less than 2 hours my battery was dead again. I went out during dinner and purchased an Olympus solid-state recorder which lasted the final 3 days on a single AAA battery, including recording all the evening sessions typically lasting into the wee hours of the morning.If you have short things to record, this is a nice option, but it's hard to justify when my Olympus recorder weighs LESS and lasts FAR longer with no hard drive noise. My only complaint about the Olympus is that it records in WMA format which needs to be converted to play on iTunes."
2,"either defective or bad design, soon to know which","Pro's: the quality of the recording is very good. I bought it to record meetings and it does a good job at that.Con's: Max hour and a quarter recording time. Unit did not save the recording before the battery went dead. Would not charge while recording, even though it was sync'd with computer. Also, without the unit attached to the iPod, there doesn't seem to navigate to the stored files to listen to them.Belkin service turned out to great. I had bought this on ebay, had no receipt, they didn't care, authorized an exchange for a new one. I will followup this review to say whether it was the particular unit that was defective, or just a lousy design."
2,Poor Recording Quality,"As a classically trained musician, I tried several different means to easily record rehearsals and practice to augment my feedback. I was excited about this option, particularly because of it's extreme portability. The recording quality was sufficient for my needs (practice, not performances), but after a few months it stopped working properly. It would skip a second or two of the recording, often at inopportune places. Though, I see now, if I had read other reviews I would have been alerted to the possibility of this problem!Perhaps, mine was a fluke. As I purchased the item after using a colleague's with great success. Eventually, however, I tried another product and have been satisfied with a slightly less portable option. :-)"
2,Poor reception & not very durable,Title says it all - reception wasn't that great. I thought it would work well and tried a few times but ended up making it even harder to try to get some music on.
3,Good tool to record talks,This an good tool to record talks and also use for the Ipod touch for use as skype micworking goodi wish it had a camera toothen one would used of video chat !!thanks for your time
3,Belkin Tune Talk Review,"I purchased this to record my college classes. When I received the item all I had to do was simply plug it into my ipod, and it immediately recognized it and pulled up the menu for voice memos. It's so easy to set up and record! Once I am at home and want to review my notes I find it in the menu organized by date and time and press play. It's that easy. There's only one thing that I don't like about it. There is some strange mechanical sound that can be heard during the recordings. I thought it might be some power saving option that the ipod itself is doing, so I have experiemented with several settings and have not figured out how to make it go away. It is not during the entire recording, it comes up in cycles, but you can still hear the recordings. However the lectures are picked up loud and clear in stereo with very little outside noise. I would recommend this product."
1,Garbage poorly made,"Within 15 minutes of attaching the tune talk, while trying to adjust the gain the little plastic widget fell right out of the tune talk thingy. I can't comment on the use of the product since I promptly took it back for a refund. It is so shoddily made that while it might be a great product WHEN it works, I wouldn't spend $60 on something that fell apart in jsut 15 minutes. I am a 45 year old woman, not rough on electronics, so I can only imagine what a student would do to this thing."
2,"Good product, HORRIBLE tech support","Good product, neat, small, useful. TERRIBLE HORRIBLE tech support. Long waits while techie looks up the simplest of questions. They're totally unprepared for the job. And I was given simply incorrect information which I had to wade through with more calls even to find out it was incorrect. If you're not a natural techie, expect a horrible experience with their tech support."
2,The surface of product is with scratches,"The product is working perfectly. The packing was good, however there are some scratches on the surface of product. Can I refund or exchange it? What can I do?It should be a brand new product, isn't it?"
2,What has great audio pickup but skips constantly? Belkin!,"I've had this product for about half a year, and have been making recordings of high school band performances, friend's concerts, etc.And the SOUND QUALITY of the recordings and the evenness of the pickup is quite exceptional. HOWEVER, what good is amazing pickup when the audio jumps every 20-30 seconds? An awful and frustrating product that teases me with its benefits and leaves me anguished at its shortcomings.Am currently looking for something better."
3,appears to work good,"It appears to record great (did some test recordings with my 60G video ipod with case on). It's not playable in my iTunes window though, even by following the instructions. I have to re-read the manual or search online. Time will tell if it actually records sound."
1,It doesn't work !,"Excuse me I'm french and speak a very bad english. I buy the Belkin tune talk in US, because it's not selled now in Europe. I Don't know why.For the moment it doesn't work ! But I've a friend whom have the same Ipod classic and the same Belkin. I'll meet her in two week and I hope she'll help me."
4,Good Performer,Product works pretty good - no complaints. You plug it in and your off and running. I have a silicone case on my G5 and the tunetalk fits great. I use it for recording music lessons with my instructor. I don't think I'd want to record any live performances as the internal mic is VERY sensative so you pick up everything even with the gain on low.
1,Needs Work,"Easy to use. Sounds clear, very convenient. But..., great if you only want to record 9 out of 10 notes in your music. The fact that it always clips the recording, and seems to miss the essential parts of what you are recording, makes this product useless. Returned after two weeks of frustration."
4,GREAT!!!,"As a student at a top music conservatory, I use the 'TuneTalk Stereo' all the time!!! It's great for recording lessons, coachings, practice sessions, or actual recordings! The quality is very very good especially for the price and size! It fits perfectly into the bottom of my 80 gig iPod and is very easy to use! I definitely recommend this to anyone... especially music students!!!!"
2,Sk ps t o m ch,"Got it as a present. Plugged it in and began speaking.On playback, about once a minute, there's these little skips. Plus you can hear the iPod harddrive whirling.I haven't tried it with a plug-in mic, but the skipping is unacceptable."
1,Didn't work!,"I hate to leave this comment in a public area. I wanted to reach out to the seller directly, however I'm new at this site and don't really know my way around. I purchased this equipment in February. I accidently through out the box it came in before I realized that the item didn't work at all. When connecting it to my iPod, nothing would happen. I tried on my relatives iPod's as well and it just wasn't functioning. I'm so disappointed considering I was really excited about my new purchase. =/"
5,Great for recoding lectures!,Fast shipping!!!!Great condition. Works well w/ my ipod. Easy to use. Reasonable price.
5,Belkin Tune Talk is Awesome!,"I used this product for an entire weekend and it worked perfectly! it is idiot proof, all you do is plug it to the ipod and its ready to go. No programming or downloading or anything its fully compatible and ready for immediate use with an 80G Ipod you get 363 Hours of digital quality recording time- my experience was amazing- i would suggest this product to all college students, or anyone going to a conference, important meeting, or seminars- Steven Reckner"
2,Broke after using twice,"Seemed to record with good sound quality, wish it had worked longer than a couple days before it broke! This is disappointing, as is the Belkin technical support."
3,Low Battery life,"Low battery life affects quality and quantity of recordings.It was immediately compatible and functioned well. Then one day I listened to my lecture and it was so low, barely audible. I found out that the battery life would not allow me to record several lectures without a recharge. Maybe it's not best with my Apple Ipod 30 GB. However, when it does record fully charged, the quality is great and there's no problem."
4,Great application- needs some support,"I find recording lectures easy and the quality satisfactory. I'm pleased in general. I like that it uploads to iTunes automatically.My criticism is that the stand is poorly crafted, flimsy and not well thought out. I don't trust it will stand up. A second problem with the stand is that if you want to have A/C power the adapter plugs into the bottom of the unit, making the stand useless. When I queried Belkin's tech support they had no sympathy and suggested that I lay it down while recording. For lectures this is not a good solution for me. I want the microphone pointed at the speaker, not the ceiling. Good product, needs a better stand."
4,Belkin TuneTalk for iPod 2G,"Bought this to record clips from our band's rehearsals; no intention to do anything very hi-fi, just to get an idea on what's happening there. And this toy does the trick - it's good enough quality, works with a single press of the button, iPod recognizes it automatically and opens the recording application, no need for batteries or setup acrobatics... so couldn't be much easier.IPod creates your recordings as .wav files which you can then convert to mp3 in your computer. Only thing that I would have liked was that the recording would be straight in mp3, to make it even more simple. .wav is an unnecessarily big format for this purpose and quality isn't that great anyhow with this sort of equipment, so no need really ..."
5,AMAZING sound quality!,"I bought this attachment to the iPod in order to record some official school IEP meetings for which I needed legal documentation--so pretty important stuff. Now, speaking as a person who didn't even know what an iPod was when my husband got one 2 years ago, this was pretty easy to use. You just plug it in at the bottom and push the button to record. Push again to stop recording and you automatically get prompted to save. The sound quality is wicked good. I had the machine sitting in the middle of a conference table and it was able to pick up all the voices around the table. The detriment to using a traditional tape recorder is that those things often pick up the white noise from its own motor running (and sometimes the sound of the vibration of its motor while sitting on top of the table) and the quality is thus compromised.I'm thrilled with this purchase. A price worth it's contribution to making my life easier.If you found this review helpful, please let me know!"
1,Skips,"The sound is great, the control is easy, but it's constantly skipping and loosing whole sentences with my iPod video. If I had noticed this issue sooner I'd have returned this, I can't even use it. I've heard this is just an issue with hard drive based iPods.If your iPod uses a hard drive and you plan on long recording, don't bother with this."
2,"OK selection, but the versions of the songs is not as listed","OK for the price, but a different version of the songs from what is listed on the CD is actually included. The two best selections, (my opinion) are The Reaper, and Heart of Glass. Though the long standard version is listed on the CD back, actually a very short verion is what plays. The Reaper is especially disappointing, the full version of 5:51 is listed but only 3:29 plays. OH well for ~$5 bucks I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Does not function,"After spending considerable effort on assembling two of these vehicles only to hear my son cry ""It doesn't pedal!"" My daughter could not get hers to work either.There is an apparant design flaw with the drive wheel. It does not sit properly and provides too much resistance. Akin to pedaling in mud or under water.I am disapointed because these look solid. Overall I am quite unhappy with my purchase."
3,better instructions needed,"typical chinese instructions, poor print and photos you can't make out photos at all, also stickers provided are wrong on 5 letters , its like the chinese print shop doesn't have a clue on the english letters, car is solid steel but could have a better drive design, only uses one wheel to drive from the pedal power, hard for a little 3 year old to power, would have prefered to find a vintage pedal car and restore"
1,cute but not very functional,"The Instep Pink Lady car is very cute, but hard to assemble and difficult for a child to pedal. Ours arrived with a bent back axle, but the Instep company FedEx(ed) us one overnight,only for it to be yellow rather than pink. The pink one will not arrive for a couple of months. Would not recommend this product."
4,adorable but stickers not pre-cut,"We just received this car for my daughter who just turned 2. It is just her size with the pedals in the closest position, and it seems to be of very high quality build. We want to decorate it with the stickers, but we were disappointed to discover that the stickers did not come pre-cut. So for each letter, poodle, music note, etc., we will have to cut them out."
5,Purchased for my daughter,"The product arrived days before it was scheduled to. That wasn't a problem but my excited daughter couldn't wait until Christmas to open it as a result! She was excited that she had gotten such a huge package (she was, admittedly 3 at the time) but no sooner than it was out the box she was more concerned with playing in the box than with the car! She's still a bit young to drive it (she's now 4) but she hardly goes near it. She's got an electric one that she prefers to drive now, but when the batteries on that one die and she has to turn to this one she'll learn the advantages! I'm happy with the purchase, but I think I should have got her a blue one because she actually hates pink! I'll get the spray paint soon..."
4,Cool car - a little tough to pedal,"My parents bought this for our 2 and 4 yr old daughters and they do like it. However, they have a little trouble pedaling for some reason. Could be I need to move the pedals closer. The finish of the car is excellent and it does get a lot of attention from the neighbors kids when they drive it out."
2,Disappointed,"I splurged on this for my daughter's 3 year old birthday because she loves riding bikes and trikes and she loves cars. She really wants to love this car but every time she drives it she gets frustrated. It is heavy and difficult to pedal and steer. It doesn't go very fast. It has a really wide turning radius and you need a driveway to be able to turn it around. She is not strong enough to stand up and pick it up to turn it around, so she gets very frustrated when she wants to turn around and come back. I wish I hadn't spent so much money on this thing. She is just as happy with a simple trike."
4,Personalization????,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She is a little too short to pedal it herself yet, but she loves sitting in it. The one thing I am disappointed with is the decal package. They only include two of each letter of the alphabet (no lower case letters). This was not enough to spell my daughter's entire name. I called In-Step to inquire about purchasing an additional decal sheet. I was told that it would cost $10 (including S&H). I thought this was a little expensive for a sheet of stickers, especially since I only needed a total of 3 letters. So, we opted to abbreviate her name (and still only had enough letters to do it on one side). Also, when the car arrived it was missing three of the wheels. Rather than go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon, my dad opted to call In-Step. They sent out the missing wheels which we received two days later. So, it proved not to be a major problem, but still kind of a hassle."
4,"Decent for buildings, great for homes.","The tone is a little weak when traced over the full 100m for Cat5e in my building, but all the tools work rather well. The tone works great over shorter distances."
3,"works, but...",Filter is clear and appears to be a good choice for a lens protector. It is an ultra thin filter which can help avoid vignetting. However the thin size doesnt leave enough threads on the front to fully seat a lens cap or stack a second filter.
3,Great for HD and DVD but not TV,"I don't know who writes these reviews but I have had this TV for a year and I do not agree with most of the reviews. Although I love the TV for watching DVD movies and for the HD, it is a pain to watch regular cable TV with it. I enjoy watching TV on my 15 year old 20"" Sharp TV far better. Since I like to watch alot of TV I am not very happy with it. I wish I had taken it back and tried the Sony widescreen instead, although I have no way knowing if it would have been any better."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!,"I bought this from Target and even though it says it is wood, it is not, it's some kind of wood colored tape that peels off. Not worth the $$. I bought it as a give and am too embarrased to give it. Hopefully Target will take it back."
3,Disappointing Display,We ordered this for a birthday present and upon installation we realized that the display is not great. On the scoreboard part of the display the 3rd player score is all distorted and is difficult to see what that players score is. We would be returning if we still had the box.
5,Every yogi needs this as a reference,"As I began my yoga teacher training, I felt like I was learning another language. Many of the words are completely foreign. Having this text book handy has been a godsend."
1,Yoga History,"This book is primarily concerned with the history of yoga and source texts, with very little attention paid to the practice of yoga. Of the hundreds of yogasanas, only a handful are covered (possibly as few as twenty) and there is zero coverage of yoga as it has evolved in the West over the past 40 years and no mention of Iyengar or Bikram. If you are a practitioner of yoga then you will find little of practical value in this book. If you are an armchair yogi with an interest in history, you will find what you want here."
3,Great and Satisfies the craving for Tropical Music,It delivers the Latin flavor that your missing in you collection. A must buy.
4,ONEGAI TEACHER,"i thought the book was cOol!but i not done with it.So.......ya it was good, I liked the caracters but I couldn't say the names good.The book i sabout a 18 year old boy named kei that doesn't know that he is going to and up marring he's teacher.(this book is not for kids under the age of 13,So for all the kids out there don't read this one. wieght intill your a lil' older.)Now he noes his wafe is half alien,But he doesn't care.He gets mad at her because she treats he like a 13 year old. She's jelious because she seen him with a nother girl.so she spys on him,and she go cought spyin on him so he got more mad at her.So......dats as far as I gots So BYE!"
2,Just for the consumate collector,"I collect all things Bowie, but I gotta say, Mr. Bowie doesn't have much to say in this collection(well nothing at all, really). It gives some great insight into some historical moments, but seems to focus on Trevor Bolder's discontent about the Spiders being disbanded. It just makes for sour grapes, really. There are no interviews with Bowie himself, but Angie Bowie does make a a few raucous appearances throughout the DVD. If I knew what this would have turned out to be like, I would have passed on this."
3,"Great show, annoying host.","I used to really like Anthony Bourdain. That was until I rented the box set of ""No Reservations"". You start to find out that he is really not as cool as he thinks. His jokes get old and he is like the kid in the back of the class with ADD. I still would recommend the show though!!!"
5,Best one yet!,# 13 is the best book of the senoir year series yet! The Conner and Liz thing was good but the Jessica/Jeremy/Will thing was great! And then the end of the book with the Tia thing! it left you hanging like all the others but it makes you have to read #14
5,It was great!,"If you love Liz and Conner together, you've got to read this one! It's by far the best one in the series so far."
1,Beware,"Parents, beware of this board game. It is cheap. The doll stands break, the playing cards are thin an hard to handle, and the directions for the game are so small. Get out your magnifying glass. Also, the close to dress the dolls are impossible to put on and once you do, they don't stay on correctly. My 10 year old daughter is a huge Bratz fan and has almost all of the board games and she took this one back. Not worth the money and the frustration."
3,ok....,this game is cool' dont get me wrong but I saw this in a store and they looked like lil' bratz!
4,We will be re-reading this tonight!,I always use these to reinforce important concepts. These books are great lessons that can be used again and again.
3,Love the bear family,My 5 year old likes the illustration and loves each member of the bear family. These books are a tradition I am happy to keep.
2,Manners,Did not love some of the wording in the book. I would have preferred a more positive outlook on manners but it did help my daughter gain a new perspective.
5,Wonderful!,"The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29. Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.This book is a great example. Almost all parents are familiar with the difficulty that kids have in learning and practicing good manners, and often have a tough time in teaching kids how to be polite. One of the best things about this book is that it's not just the kids who are the naughty ones, Papa Bear has some rudeness problems, and even Mama Bear succumbs to an issue at one point. It's great for kids to learn that manners are a lifelong skill that will always take a little bit of practice. This book is a wonderful place to start."
1,Doesn't fit,"Be warned. This filter doesn't fit into YORK furnaces. Not only it's higher than the enclosure, but it's longer. I've bought other filters of 16x25x5 size and they fit perfectly. This one measures 5.5 inches and over 25 inches in length, so it can't be fit in at all."
5,"Natural born, low-down, hard-driving Chicago blues","For those who missed seeing Luther Allison, this collection from the seventies finds him at the top of his game as a great old school blues man who pumped fresh energy and passion into some fine old songs from Elmore James, Robert Johnson and Buddy Guy. He puts his distinctive twist into each one, particularly his supercharged version of ""Sweet Home Chicago"", a song he used to close his shows during this period. Luther took over Freddie King's band after King's early death and he pays an intense tribute to him in ""I'm Going Down"". Luther had an electrifying effect upon his audiences, the women even more so than the men and he struts his stuff in his fine ""I Got Worries."" As a devoted admirer of Luther Allison since I first heard him in the early eighties, this album remains one of his four best."
4,not bad for beginning bass,i am a professional bass player and i have to say this is a very cost effective bass for those that want a nice punch to your music. it can't handle a mind numbing beat but it does well for the average beat.
2,get what you pay for,"Overall not bad.they don't hit too hard my wife was looking for a little more bass than her stock system but didn't want to over do it and these subs do the job.only real problem was the lights.the remote after about a week melted.smelled something burning and that's what it was.plugs into the cig lighter and the company was not too helpful.needless to say,she still doesn't have lights.that's the only reason for the low rating,almost started afire.other than that you def get your moneys worth"
1,waste of my money,"I saved up all my money to by a decent audio system so read reviews their were all OKso i decided to go with these subs, must say i made the biggest mistake.i hooked it up to a hifonics brutus 1200 watt amp and the left speaker just gave up in 10 mins of playing on half volumei would never purchase a pyramid product."
1,WORST SUBWOOFER EVER,"I literally was charged for this twice and I didnt even order it. The thing came in anyway so i sent it back. After that I was only refunded $49.51 cause it was claimed ""damaged"". Never again will i buy this or any pyramid products. Buyer beware!"
4,pretty good,"I have to admit that after reading some reviews on the maker of this I was skeptical... But I've had it hooked up for a while now an have to say that I'm not disappointed at all. I would recommend these for anyone who wants a nice bump to their ride, they're a head turner."
5,"So far, so good.",Haven't hooked it up yet but I'm happy so far. Item came earlier than expected and brand new and still sealed in factory packaging as advertised.
5,Great Product,"I got these speakers for christmas and I love them. I am a young kid and I must say that I am surprised to how hard they hit. They sound just as good as my friends sound systems, even better. I love the built in neon and how it pulsates to the music. I have it hooked up to a 300watt amp and they still hit very hard."
1,Horrible,This product sucked was not loud at all lights didn't work overall a bad product that's jus taking up space
2,"Sucks, get mtx terminators","If you're looking for subs that make your car shake or even your trunk, these aren't the subs, if you want subs that can be heard down the road or even the person next to you in traffic, these are not the ones. I had these hooked up to an 1100 watt amp and i could barely feel the bass, i even had a friend come in my car and asked me when i was getting the subs i was so excited about and i had to tell him they were already in there ha but these subs are good if your just looking for JUST enough bass to hear the beat clearly but in my opinion, i would go with the mtx terminators because its only $20 more. I ended up returning these and getting the terminators which kick real hard"
1,Ok craftmenship.,"After getting out of the box and inspecting noticed dust and wood chips in the viewing area and the mirror was dirty. Also, on one side the wall with a speaker attached was nailed in the wrong place making a gap between the mirror and carpet where you can see the bare wood. One of the plastic crome ports came off in my hands and had to be glued back on. Have not got to hear yet because the amp did not work."
3,Not a System,"Bassed on the description we thought this ""system would include the amplifier. It is not a system, it is only speakers"
2,Not working,I was unable to use these speakers because they did not work when I got the box opened. They had a funny smell comparable to an electrical fire smell. I have sent them back and was refunded fully and now I am waiting to get a different product.
1,do not buy!,First week they were all right but then the left one stop working and i hook it up with a 600 watt amp. now im thinking of getting the MTX 12 inch subwoofer with a boos 1200 watt amp.para los que ablan espanol bandpass subwoofers son una basura no recomiendo este producto ni para los principiantes la primera semana la del lado isquierdo paro de trabajar las tenia con un amp de 600 WATTS.
2,dont buy,"the subs delivered in a few days. hooked them up to a 1000 watt amplifier and the voice coils were messed up in about two days. neon lights never worked since the day i got them. replaced the subs inside with two 1000 watt 10"" pioneer subs and found out the right half of the box was not put together correctly and had nails sticking out so i had to fix that and still the box cant take a hit without making vibrating noises. im glad i only payed a hundred for it was a total waste of money."
1,This is the worse book I have ever read,I am a computer science student at F.I.U. and unfortunately I was required to buy and use this book. The book is extremely bad. First of all it does not give any anwser for any of the exercises. The explanations are so superficial that you never get the point right unless you get some external help. It has just too few bad designed examples for each theorem and definition (1 or 2). It seems that this book was created with the sole purpose of getting profits by requering students to buy it. I strongly recommend not to buy this book unless your are required like I was.
1,Awful Book,This is a terrible book. The author spends way to much time on unimportant/irrelevant example topics and does not give you the tools necessary to complete the exercises. Additionally the solutions in the back appear to be only for easy problems. Hope that you are not required to use such an awful book...
3,Not a good textbook,"This is the text book for our formal language course. This book really confuses me (and many other students). Our instructor does nice job to explain the topics in his own language, which is much easier to understand. This proves that there is a better way to make those topics more understandable. I don't want to say that it is not a good book. But it's not a good text book for computer science students. Instructors should read the reviews on amazon.com before them select the text books for their students."
1,Read my message before you buy,"I regret that I bought this book for my class. The book is required yet it doesn't really help me understanding automata. Even my professor tells me not to read certain sections. I guess he thinks the rest of the sections are okay to read. I have a test coming up next week and I can't believe I find myself searching for another textbook or study guide to help me understanding automata. If I knew this book doesn't fit me, even if it's required, I wouldn't have bought it. Because class is basically based on notes, not the textbook. I think if I find a book that can feeds my curiosity as a student, then I'll be happy. Hopefully I find THE BOOK before it's too late. What a book! Sorry author, you did a great job, but my level is not there yet!!!"
2,Not for an independent learner,"I think the book is ok for people who have access to a live instructor, or for those who already know the subject and want a review. The lack of problems with answers makes learning from the book difficult. Many of the exercises are pretty useless/worthless. More explanation in English of what is going on would also help the beginner."
2,It's ok,"The book was required for a course, and I found it to be pretty straightforward, if a little dull. It's written at a simpler level than Sipser or Hopcroft and Ullman, which might make it appropriate for someone who is a little apprehensive about the topic (although I think both of those are better books). My biggest complaint was that after finding the first two errors in the text (in an exercise solution and an example), I wasn't comfortable trusting the book to tell me what it meant. The errors were listed in the errata, so if you're using the book, print out a copy of the errata, and mark your book up. Finding these errors for yourself is a good test of your understanding, but it's also more pain than necessary. Use with caution."
2,Not a good book,"First off, let me say this book did not confuse me. It's just very poorly written. If this was the only Automata book I ever read, my review would not mean as much. On the contrary, I have read 4-5 Automata books and have taught the topic numerous times. I urge teachers and students to avoid this book. If you would like a great book covering this material, get Dexter Kozen's Automata and Computability. That book is so well written and elegant that it puts most of the other books to shame. It is one of the top CS books on my list along with SICP, CLRS, and a few others. In addition, the ""OLD"" version of Hopcroft and Ullman is pretty good but the newer version with Motwani is bad. Anyways, I hope this helps some of you who are looking for a good book to read."
1,This book is not useful in the understanding of Automata.,"I had to purchase this book for a required class in Computer Science. I don't understand how a book that has soo many bad reviews could be required for a class. I checked some of my answers with the Instructor's solution manual and even the manual was useless. For example, the answer for section 3.2 #1 says ""Routine application of a given contruction"". NOW, DOES THIS ANSWER HELP YOU? Don't think that this is the only answer like this, most of the answers in the manual are similar. No one even knows who the author's audience is... I think people who buy this book is because it's a requirement. I think that every University that requires this book should think it over."
1,Blackburn products are cheap,"Dont buy this product. I have the other mountain bike pump which is same junk just smaller. Its 90% plastic which doesnt hold up even with very occasional use. Save your money, get something else."
1,We want Season Three! Season Four! Season Five!,"Paramount, please, please release another season of Perry Mason in my lifetime. Forget the 50th Anniversary and release Season 3.......The customer may not always be right, but the customer is ALWAYS the customer.....Your customers are speaking, Paramount!!!"
1,Too Stupid To Believe,Were people really that stupid in the old days or just the team of this TV show?It seems that women were completely useless back then and the only thing they knew how to do was scream.And there seemed to be no love greater than assuming the one you love is a murderer so you must do everything you can to make sure the murderer never get caught even if you have to sacrafice yourself to protect the bad guys.Most characters in the show were simply too stupid to live and deserved to be in the terrible trouble they created for themselves.Can't believe it was such a big hit!
1,Disappointed,"I am an avid fan of the old black and white Perry Mason series. I only own one half season and it was expensive. I really want to collect them all, but they are too pricey. I'll keep watching re-runs on syndicated television until the prices come down. I was disappointed to see far more low ratings for this anniversary edition than high ratings. I won't buy it either."
1,Ridiculous,"Perry Mason (50th Anniversary Edition)I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who are a bit ticked at this ""half-season"" nonsense. The loyal Mason fan is being played along like a lying-witness on the witness stand. And these ""specials"", like this 50th anniversary item, are just a double-billing junket. I'll hold off thank you.Regards from Canada.Tony"
2,Perry Mason's Value Not Based on Nostalgia,"Watching the shows put together for this 50th Anniversary edition, I realized just how good the basic writing and story telling of the original series was. The closer the presentation got to nostalgia, especially the 1985 movie-of-the-week, the less I enjoyed the experience. It may be because I was only six-years old when the series debuted, but I ended up wishing this had been straight mysteries from Season 3."
2,WHAT'S THIS?,"Got the movie as promised, but was not real impressed with it! Definitely not worth the money! A bunch of garbage thrown together from several seasons that didn't make no sense! One wasn't even Perry Mason it was Betty Davis.. four discs an the third one was a bunch of nothing interviews that I had no interest in. Take my word, save your money!"
4,"All well and good,but...........","Lets get on with Season Three,Volume 1!For crying out loud,with the pacethey are moving,it will take 7 years to release all 9 seasons!By the time this special edition comes out in April,it will already have beenfive months since Season Two,Volume 2.Season Three should be out in April,not this special.While on this subject,this half season nonsenseis out of hand.Why dont they release the full season or two volumes atthe same time like they did with Combat?You buy both or you buy one andmost likely everybody will buy both anyway so release the volumestogether,this 7-8 months in between is just idiotic!"
1,Just Say No!,"As a devoted Perry Mason fan, I've purchased the last four half-season DVD sets.Yes, I grumbled at having them released as half-seasons, being expensive and having no ""bonus"" extras but I still enjoyed them and I hope the rest of the series makes its way to DVD.But I draw the line at this contrived ""Anniversary"" edition which is just a shoddy attempt to extract even more money from long-suffering Mason fans!Well Paramount, I ain't biting. You've gone to the well once too often."
5,Mason's 50th Anniversary--A Real Gem,"This set is awesome because,m it you don't plan to buy the whole series, it's the best value for your money, especially since it contains many notable extra features AND the only color episode of the entire series run."
1,Oh for Pete's sake,"Just release the entire series 271 episodes. Yes it may be high price ticket, but let us get it on DVD, if we can afford Gasoline we can afford The Complete Set of Perry Mason."
2,We Want Season Three! We Want Season Three!,"What gives, Paramount? Why issue this hodge-podge of episodes? I thought that maybe Paramount was trying to pull a ""cheap one"" by giving us a release that provided some of the remaining episodes that were published on VHS and DVD by Columbia House, but I found only three of these episodes were previously released by Columbia House. So they have taken the time and expense to release 9 episodes heretofore not yet released. Why not just continue with Season Three?!!! And release it at one time!!!I give Perry Mason, the TV series, 5 stars, but Paramount's release schedule Zero stars.Paramount, I hope you are listening!"
1,LETS GET ON ALREADY!!,I'm with some of others here. Let us get on with bringing out FULL seasons at once starting with season 3. I'm definitely NOT going to get this ridiculous 50th Anv. nonsense.
1,I Agree...Just Say NO!,"I could not agree more that this ""special edition"" seems to be a mostly exploitative move.I, too, have been a devoted fan of this series since it first aired (and I was a tiny sprout). It has a level of writing that's far more mature than any series on television today. So I was ecstatic when it began being released on DVD.But can't we just get on with releasing the series in serial order? Please. Don't encourage this cash-tease tactic by buying this set."
1,Please release all the Seasons,"Please release all the seasons before I lack the money or mental capacity to enjoy them.This pricing - dribble out model will probably not build momentum with the core fan base who will buy all the episodes if the other reviews are a fair sample, and will definitely not create new fans who view it as a differentiated, luxury product, which the Anniversary edition is attempting. Those of us who grew up with the series will buy it if the current DVD producers use the volume strategy while there is volume there. Whoever reads these reviews for Amazon and provides feedback to manufacturers should ask the DVD producers some hard business questions."
1,Will I live long enough to see all episodes on DVD?,"As smart as the people at Viacom think they are, they should realize that their audience for the B&W; Perry Mason's is limited. Most are over 50 and as time goes on may not be around forever to be able to buy the entire series. I suggest that Viacom release the subsequent years on a quicker basis, since once the baby boomers are gone, so will the demand for your product.Finally, I will not be one of those to buy the annivesary edition only to get duplicates in later releases."
1,NO!,"Uh, lets have Season 3 all in one volume, please. This is a waste of money and I for one am not going to go for it. With the now much shorter seasons, it is time to release the Season 3 in a single set. If it is released in two sets, going to wait for the price to really fall before getting them.As for this set? No way! Ever!"
1,GET BACK TO THE SEASON RELEASES!,"Plese, Paramount, it's time to start releasing Perry Mason series complete seasons more quickly!!! Quick dragging your feet! I've been waiting for years to get all the seasons on DVD. At the rate you're going, I will be long gone to see all seasons!"
1,"Paramount , are you listening?","Paramount, the greatest Perry Mason fans ever are trying to tell you something!!! We don't want this stinking Anniversary edition. All we want is for you to release season three in one volume immediately and then the following seasons at reasonable intervals thereafter. Is this that hard to understand? Hello ..........."
3,Inferior quality DVD's.,"I have been ordering the Perry Mason series as it becomes available and mistakenly thought this would be the same quality. I liked the concept and enjoyed the extras provided. However, I found the quality of the DVD not up to par. I had trouble getting my DVD player to recognize it and play properly. Most likely should have returned it."
5,The very BEST of the 9 seasons!,"Every episode that stuck in my mind from when I watched the series in syndication are in this collection, including ""Twice Told Twist,"" the sole episode filmed in COLOR! CBS really outdid themselves with this 4-disc retrospective on one of TV's most enduring drama series. There's not a scratch on any of the films, and they got Barbara Hale to introduce each episode. A must-have for ""Perry Mason"" fans!"
3,TMI,"As it turns out, unless you're a conductor (which I'm not) you don't need the full score. And you certainly don't need it in Italian. I kept it for the novelty, but couldn't use it in my role as a chorister."
1,Uh-Uh Uh-Uh Baby!!!! 0 Stars.,"How can Mariah release such a scary, horrifying song?? This s*#$ is scary. Mariah has lost her ability to sing. ""Gliiter"" is horrible and terrifying. Don't waste your money on this or any music from ""Glitter"". Don't buy the movie either. Charmbracelet is a better album although, I was suprised that Charmbracelet did well after the downfall with ""Glitter""."
1,WORST SONG OF ALL TIME!,"This has got to be the worst song in history. Amazon needs to add a zero rating to the rating selector so we can give it the true score it deserves. When I heard this the first time I thought, ""what has happened to the Mariah who had a great voice?"" It gets worse with each listen."
3,"Generally good, horrible battery","I bought this laptop last year at Best Buy for school. I was excited to see it was only 800 dollars so I thought it was great. I've had it for a year and it hasn't done anything majorly bad. However, my battery lasts only for an hour, and it takes a while to completely load when I turn it on (this could be my own fault though.) I wish the battery lasted longer because I bought it for school. If you know you will be able to plug it in then it's great. For things like school, I would invest in a centrino computer opposed to a celeron. They last longer.Anyone know where you can get a better battery for this one???"
4,TS-M45-S165 laptop,"I have three weeks with this computer. Up to now it has been reliable, fast and do not become hot on duty which is very important to me. The only thing I do not like so much is the screen size and shape, It is not square, it is kind of retangular, maybe because I am used to squared screen monitors that I find it weird."
2,What good is a laptop without software?,"I purchased this laptop in August 2005 with the understanding that it came loaded with Windows XP home edition.I found out that the software loaded was a trial version (good for 60 days)and when I attempted to enter the software's ""permanent"" keycode, I got an ""invalid keycode"" message.According to Toshiba's tech support, I have to purchase the software at an additional cost of $200.00.I could have saved some money and aggravation by buying a different brand. I would not recommend the Toshiba."
4,Where They Lay: Searching for America's Lost Soldiers,My husband was a part of this unit back in that Viet Nam era manning their radio's when they went down so it was a very moving book for him. It brought much closure for him and for us.Thank you author/s.
5,A brilliant book,"Mystery writing doesn't get any better than this. It's the sort of book you can read five times and always find something new. Thanks, Mike."
5,Solid amp,"This amp works perfectly. Had about 18 months now and have had zero problems. Using it bridged for an MTX sub, bumps pretty good. Upgrading soon to the 1500m mono amp for my RE Audio sub. I would recomend any Profile amp for sure."
5,Doesn't Fit Pro's Kit Punch Down CP-3140,"The blade is well made and it should do its job. I know this is for a Paladin standard impact punchdown tool. I bought the blade because I needed it for a Pro's Kit CP-3140 standard punchdown and the picture of the blade, on both Amazon and Paladin Tools, were similar to those of the Pro's Kit. Well, in the end it didn't fit. The body, shaped as a hexagon, on the Paladin blade is slightly wider or basically bigger. This is just a warning for those who think it would fit on the Pro's Kit punchdown tool."
4,Swivels,"Other reviewers are right. Even when it is in the stud, it swivels from side to side. Other than that, it looks good. Still hard to hide all the wires."
1,What a waste ...,I just wanted to see the movie I liked so much when I was a teenage. Apparently I didn't have a good taste at that time. This is less than a so-so spaghetti western. I would have done better with my two hours!
1,Turn off the sound !,"I don't know what the fuss is all about. The story is mediocre. The villains are hardly a challenge for the hero. The acting is B-movie standard. The music however.... The music is something else, let me tell you;There is this operatic voice of a woman that keeps telling the story as it progresses, explaining the emotions of the characters as the story unfolds. If that wasn't bad enough the lead character in his thick european accent starts joining in, singing backup about the pain and suffering he is going through. I either had to lower the volume or fast forward through most of the movie it was so unbearable. Do yourself a favour, catch a western where Ennio Morricone does the score like A Fistfull of Dollars or The Great Silence. This western was too painfull to watch with the sound on."
1,Total Waste of My Money,"A ridiculous, predictable film featuring the most annoying ""vocal"" theme song throughout the film. Keoma (Nero) is the half Indian son of a man with three other sons who dislike and are jealous of Keoma. The townsfolk are held under the thumb of bad guy Caldwell, and his posse. Well, Keoma takes care of them, along with a nameless woman he goes out of his way to protect. I was offended that the N-word was thrown about regarding the lone Black man who served as the banjo playing alcoholic who tries to help Keoma get the bad guys. A completely forgettable film."
4,Stand,"Very melodic and clearly has the right influence that is reminiscent of the ""Prince"" era. The tract ""Stand"" is a cut above. Overall, great album."
5,Great Chakra related meditation CD,"I really like this CD and listen to it every couple of months, though could do so a lot more often if i put the time aside. It is a meditation on calling up Kundalini energy through the chakras, and is largely an active meditation (ie seated/alert) rather than one you would do while lying down/falling asleep. The Sanskrit chants can be heard in the background with the core mantras for each chakra in the foreground as you move through each. As far as chakra work goes, this is my favorite cd/meditation by far, though i do like steven halpern for more passive work.If you are wanting to expand awareness and consciousness around your chakras, i would definitely recommend this CD."
4,Chris Live At Pizza On the Park,This may not be Chris Conner's greatest moment but any night listening to Chris is magical. Drop in to this fine set set from London in 1990 and you will not want to go home.
2,where are the pics!?,I bought the kindle version of this book and its missing the photos! Kinda pointless without the instructional images. Super disappointed.
4,Brings back the ibiza beach feel,"If you've been to the Sa Trincha beach bar in ibiza, you've heard jon sa trincha spinning some of the best beach music in the world fitting to this piece of paradise, playa de las salinas. these 2 cds contain original tracks of chilled out techno/reggae/i dont know you won't hear on any other chilled/sunset ibiza mix. while i really wish i could be one of the bead sellers who live there full time, i'll get by listening to these until i can go again."
5,Excellent,"I haven't finished the book yet, but the conversational style of Lucas' book make this a ""cover-to-cover"" read instead of JUST a simple reference book. This applies to his articles too, he regularly writes columns for the ""Big Scary Demons"" section on O'Reilly dot com. It'll probably make a great reference book after the cover-to-cover read.I get information that I can immediately put to use (new commands or new ways to use old commands) each time a read a section of the book.This book is well worth the bucks."
4,"If you really want to draw Batman, buy this book.","I went to 6 stores in search of this book because I was dying to learn how to draw Batman. Yes, I know, I sound like a loser, but to be honest, it's a great book. However, if you lack artistic abilities (like me) you'll struggle quite a bit on catching onto the drawing styles. I know this book is directed towards kids but I don't care. I like it. I just wish it were a longer book."
4,awsome book but...,This book starts out like a book for kids.but towards the middle it gets a lot better.I needed help on posses and 3 point angles.This book is a great book if ur a beginner or love batman like me....
3,"Decent for a while, but didn't last","I've owned the Kenwood wireless speaker module for a while now and it worked ok for a while, but its quality has faded over time. I don't know if this is indicative of other units or not.I've always been able to hear a little noise from the rear speakers if I have my ear close, but when the speakers were placed further away I didn't notice the noise.Occasionally I would hear a loud pop of static, but it didn't happen often. Recently though the frequency of these pops has become too much and I'm back shopping for a better solution. In the meantime I've had to stop using the rear speakers."
4,Works like a charm,"I set this system up, and put on Saving Private Ryan, specifically the Omaha Beach sequence which is one of the best DVD surround mixes out there, and it performed admirably.My only beef with the system is that the wires from the transmitter to your receiver are VERY short and not replaceable, so you have to position the transmitter no more than a foot from the source, making it hard to avoid interference from the surrounding machines.Give me longer wires, and it'll be a 5 star review for the next generation."
4,Great Substitute for Running Wires,"This item is a great way to get your rear surround speakers sounding great without running wires from the front of the room. I have hardwood floors and there was no good way to hide the wires. This has performed really well. It is not as good as wires, but it is pretty darn close."
4,No more wires across the living room floor!,"Instead of running wires across your room a wireless transmitter sends the signal from your tv / dvd /receiver to the wireless receiver in the back of the room. You simply plug in the wireless receiver in the back of your room, plug it into the AC outlet, and run the speaker wires from the back receiver to you rear speakers.The good: No more snaking wires under carpets , around coffee tables, along base boards. Very easy to setup and use and good sound. Mine is setup about 20' from the receiver and I haven't had any problems.The bad: none i have found!"
5,Worked Perfectly,"The Kenwood RFU-6100 Wireless Module for Surround Speakers worked perfectly for me in the finished basement, where running wires would have been very difficult."
4,Ormanent Storage Box,I thought the dividers would be sturdier than they are but other than that I am quite satisfied.
3,It is what it is I guess,It's just a large plastic box with some flimsy cardboard pieces (which you have to assemble yourself) thrown inside of it.
2,Flaw in design,"There are no sides to the layer trays, so you must empty a tray before you can pull it out. Otherwise, all of the ornaments around the outside edge fall out once you lift it up. You must empty each tray to get to the tray below.Also, flatter ornaments will slide underneith the dividers and will cause the tray to sit uneven, separtate from the bottom, and make a mess.Update: I created cardboard sides and larger bottoms, and taped/glued it all together. Now it works great, but unfortunately, I had to spend an entire evening doing this."
4,Ornament Storage,This box did just what I needed it to do. The only con I found was the flimsy cardboard dividers. They will wear out after a few uses.
4,Sturdy,Good size-so as not to get too heavy. Had too many layer dividers for me due to some larger ornaments but I just left them out.Worked out great!!
4,Strong Advice,It's hard to be everyone's friend. It just the dynamics of our society. But this book certainly points you in the right direction.
5,"On target for learning and understanding how to 'Get Along""","I highly recommend ""Get Along..."" to anyone interested in deepening an understanding of communications. Well written! 'Readable' and entertaining. It certainly deserves the 5 stars that Amazon gives it!!!"
2,Surface-Level Only,"For new teachers, this might be a useful book. It probably would have helped me when I started teaching (although at that point I found the Canters' Assertive Discipline, and that also worked). At this point, though, I found it shallow and lacking in the real substance I need to help me reach those last few students for whom ordinary strategies do not work."
5,OnMinute Discipline,"One-Minute Discipline provides a framework for management techniques, strategies, and ideas. Every teacher can find something of value in this informative guidebook."
3,Stear Clear,It's not enough that they almost encourage vandalism-they feel the need to fascilitate trespasing.Goofy belaboured humour is only really practical when youre a kid-this book tries too hard and achieves to little.
1,BUYER BEWARE-KEEP YOUR MONEY,"I found this PAINFULLY bad. It seems to me entirely thrown together to make a quick buck, and charge for total crap. I found NOTHING useful here. I use a Mac, and the entire ""tutorial"" itself is based on using a specific WINDOWS tool (disclosure would have been nice) - super old school and clunky. After a few minutes, wincing in pain, I turned it off."
3,NOTE: This is not the great jazz guitar player.,"I was looking for the great jazz guitar player. Frankly, it's pretty good acoustic folk stuff, but it isn't what I thought it was."
3,good,"The product shipped fast during the holiday season which is nice. I have purchased same product twice. Last one was broken soon after purchasing. And, I wish this one can stand longer."
2,Coin Wallet Purchase,Very disappointed in quality of item bought (made in China). Thin beyond belief. Exorbitant charge for S/H! Delivery as promised.
2,inexpensive change purse,I thought this item was a steal at $6.00. When I recieved the item I found it to be only worth the price. I will not be using it. I ordered another style for more money. The item is not worth returning. The purse is usable but very simply made.
5,wouldn't leave home without it,Very handy item. Also carry a spare key in it. Drop in a button or some other retreaved item to prevent loss.
5,Solid Item,I wanted something for my glove compartment into which I could throw loose change; this fits the bill.It is unobtrusive and closes tightly. I recommend this.
4,good value,"Leather is not fancy, but if you consider the price it is great value. I have it now for serveral weeks and it looks the same"
4,"""cost vs performance""","I always read the negative reviews first and after reading them for this product, I expected to receive some unusable trash. I actually was pleasantly surprised. The leader is not that bad and it will last much more than two weeks. I expect it to last few years. Shipping was slow. It took 10 days to get it, but I will still give it 4 stars for for the ""cost vs performance"""
4,Very Useful!,"This book is wonderful for the student who is learning on his/her own. My sensei also recommended it during my first college class. I started using it a year before I started any formal education in Japanese. Be sure to pick up the Handbook too! It provides 3 different dictionaries, two of which train you how to look up kanji in kanji dictionaries. Using the book will help the serious self-tought student and the ambitious classroom student to excell at writing. The only flaw is that it isn't that useful for learning to read, but there are other good texts out there for learning to read Japanese."
2,good imagination,This is probably one of the poorest written and organized books I've ever read. I got through it by shear determination. It has a lot of interesting ideas in it and I agree with much of what the author has to say.I am a believer in his message. He has great enthusiasm and imagination but goes off on personal tangents way too often. I would recommend this only if you have a great interest in the subject and can spare the time. The book could have been half as long. This lake is only an hour away from my home and I read the book it with a visit in mind. The book on Cohokia in central Illinois is much easier to read but of course only related not the same site.
3,"Zero Clearance Insert, Craftsman","These UHMW plastic inserts are satisfactory; but, not great due to the slight curvature of the upper surface. When trying to level the insert surface with the table saw, the center upward bulge doesn't allow the edges to adjust flush with the table saw top."
4,Satisfying End To A Very Good Series,"Michael Flynn concludes the near-future ""Firestar"" series in style. In the year 2017 the varied cast comes together to try to save Earth from impending disaster - an asteroid has somehow changed course and is now on a collision course with earth. The machinations of the previous novels all finally make sense, as there is now a team of dedicated, well-trained professionals perfectly equipped to attempt an intercept and diversion of the asteroid. This novel ties up all the political and industrial loose ends, and gives closure to the character development (although it must be noted that not all endings are happy ones). Flynn embraces the near-future genre with all the deftness and imagination of Heinlein while adding a very definite hard technical slant. This series may not be great fare for those readers who despise techno-babble, but for the rest of us it's a satisfying feast."
2,Underwhelmed,"Well... other reviews made this game sound better than it actual is in real life.Out of the box one laser was way off target and impossible to adjust where it needed to point. My 12 yr old and I finally gave in and tried to play with a slightly off laser. Game play was 'ok' but we found ourselves 'massaging' the various piece positions to get a desired outcome. And, as others already explained, the lasers would go off randomly.None of my 4 kids (8,10,12, & 17) has touched the game since the first day we gave it the 'old college try'. The concept of the game has promise but this current version needs more work.Bottomline- not worth the $40 price tag."
1,NOT ACCEPTABLE.,"This game contains real lasers. Not a suitable game for children. First and foremost, a game for children should be safe to play. This one could blind your child, forever. NOT ACCEPTABLE. We returned our copy of the game."
5,"very good product, with a good price!!!","I bought this memory for my Dell Inspiron 640m Laptop, the computer works great, i already have 512MB dimm and with this purchase y increase it to 1GB, i'am very pleased with this transaction."
2,Unusable Book - and not for the content.,"This book might be wrought with ageless wisdom, colorful history and practical horse sense- but who would know! The type is way too small (and my vision is perfect) and the text is too far into the spine. That adds up to one unpleasant reading experience-IF you can even manage the arduous task of trying to read this book. Time for a major reformatting by the publisher."
5,Acrylic Globe,Purchased this globe for screened in porch light. The glass globes just do not hold up to the wind; break and shatter all over the floor. So far this acrylic globe has held up to the wind.
2,missing part,"sling is o.k.a.y. for the price but it came with missing part.i only had 2 ""sliders(buckle)"" (metal part uses to tie down) on the string instead of 3 (needed one on each ends for swivel + 1 for lenght adjustment). luckly, i had few extra sliders from other sling that i don't use anymore.Cartridge holder works. i holds the ammo tight.i didn't have time to try it on my rifle.. if it fails as the other guy posted, i will give you an update. (maybe i better stitch it after the swivel buckle before it fails... haha..)"
1,Low quality,I wouldn't trust the buckles on this sling to carry a Red Rider BB gun on a mile hike. This item is going back. I'm out $5 shipping.
1,Nice Bag But Way Too Small,"I should have read the other reviews better before buying the bag. Kodak has a nice idea, but the bag just isn't big enough."
2,Kodak Bag,I purchased this bag for my Kodak Easy Share 4330 digital camera. I thought the bag was going to be a lot smaller than what I received. I already have the Kodak travel kit so I didn't need another big bag and this bag is too big just for the camera.
2,Not as fun as we thought!,"This shark has to be assembled by putting on the fins and tail. Very easy to do, but now it can not be packed back in the box without taking is apart again. The cards did not shoot out easily at first, just make sure the red tab is on top, not underneath the cards. The object is to put the little fish on top of the big fish, there are many, many cards and a few of the fish are so close in size that it is hard for a small child to tell, quickly, which is larger. Also, the shark is used to change the color selection, but the shark looks just like some of the other fish. I had a hard time determining which one was the shark. My son was so excited when he saw the commercial, but we only played this game 2x since Christmas. I wish the fish rotated on its own, so you don't have to manually turn it to face someone, each time you want the cards to shoot out. Its an average toy to play if you just want to be silly and shoot cards at someone."
4,The obession of Victoria Gracen,"I like the idea that a person's life can change in ways they never expect, The inspiration to be kind and reach out to someone who needs you was the message of the story."
2,I'm past reading Grace LIvingston Hill I found,Loved her books and still have a few story lines I enjoyed as a kid but I just didn't feel up to the extreme emotional beat of her books. Flat characters.
1,WT* is this?,"I honestly couldn't even finish reading this, and had to stop near the beginning. It was really, truly, horribly awful."
5,The Obsession of Victoria Gracen,I have always liked Grace Livingston Hill. My mother had some of her books in her library and read all of them. I was happy to come across one that I hadn't read. Grace is a beautiful writer and I plan to go back and re-read her books.
3,The Obsession of Victoria Gracen,"It really took a while to get into the book. Unless I am without anything else to read, I read it bit by bit, but then dis continued , unable to hold my interest. It is well written but felt a little depressed just before the Holidays and did not like to continue."
3,Gentle story,"This was a nice easy read. A gentle,thoughtful story with a Christian undertone threaded throughout. A very simple story line with a very predictable ending."
4,Great for thick hair,Heats up hot enough to curl my thick hair i just wish it would heat up a lot more faster. love how you can control the temperature.
3,great iron,Maybe ive been spoiled from my marcels but i need an iron i could hurry up with one i wouldnt burn myself with in a rush.I only have marcels and for those of you that dont know they dont have the plastic tip to hold onto. Its a great iron for messy large curls it doesnt hold curl long though.It may be that i just have very coarse and thick hair.I love bed head and think its great for a wavy style.
3,Just Ok...,"I had a bed head already but it was a lot smaller. It seems the bigger it gets, the less curling it does."
2,"Big, Pretty curls...","well i was soo excited to get my new curler and so i heated it up and tried it out. I got really pretty big curls and i went downstairs to show everybody... and in the time it took to walk down the stairs, my hair was straight. Straight! and my hair is naturally very wavy. I do not recommend this iron. By the way, i got the 1.5"" hoping for big loose curls. It is a very pretty iron though."
2,lifeless curls,I read the previews before I purchased it and it seemed it would be the answer for getting mine and my daughters hair curled or at least a good wave. It does not do that though. It's kind of useless.
4,Tigi FAN!!!,This is a wonderful Curling Iron! Heats up really Quick!!! Highly recommend! I work at a salon and clients love the end result!!! Very good investment!
3,Not Bad,"May be I was expecting too much based on the other reviews, but I don't think that this curling iron is anything special. It does curl nicely and it's great that it has multiple temp settings, but I think that you can get other curling irons that work just as well for less."
3,It's OK,"I bought this curling iron in hopes that it would create big waves. Even on the highest heat setting and with product, it doesn't do much to my hair and whatever it does do is gone in an hour.A couple of weird things: there is no safety rest thing, so the hot barrel has to sit directly on the countertop, which seems unsafe. Also, the snazzy looking ""fiber optics"" or whatever are USELESS! They just indicate whether you have the heat on high or low, which is indicated (in degrees, not just ""high"" vs ""low"") on the dial. There is no indicator of when the iron is actually heated up to the desired temp, which in my opinion would have been a much better use of the lights."
3,Beware...barrel is HUGE,"I bought this curling iron because I have long hair (down to the bottom of my shoulder blades) and thought I needed a large barrel to create nice waves. Well, even with really long hair, the 1.5 inch barrel is way too big. I ended up sending it back and getting a 1 inch because the 1.5 inch was so big that it didn't leave any curl in my hair. That said, I really liked the iron itself and there's nothing wrong with the product...you'll just have to use VERY small sections of hair if you want to create curl with it."
2,could be better,This curling iron is a little bulky to use and the tip is not long enough and it gets hot.
1,Poor quality,I recently had to get rid of this curling iron. I bought it four years ago. The main problem with it was that it would burn my hair frequently even if it was on the lowest setting. There must have been something wrong with the heating element. Sometimes it would work fine and other times it would work really really badly. After four years it all of a sudden stopped working completely.
4,Great product for the price,"This is a great curling iron for the price. I have very thick coarse hair and most curling irons won't make my hair curl but this one works better than any I have ever tried. The ceramic barrel doesn't allow your hair to slide through which is great and much easier to get consistent curls. I still have to use a decent amount of hair spray to keep the curls but they stay pretty well. My only complaint is I wish the barrel itself was longer, but I highly recommend this product!"
1,"Badly made, but nicely packaged","UPDATE:I used it twice, and on the 3rd time I used the product.. it died on me! The lights were still functioning but it is not heating up! BAD BAD BAD!10May2010The metal was chipped off at some parts, perhaps due to long storage. However the curler was packaged very nicely. Do not let it come in contact with water, remember to wipe it dry after use to prevent rust!"
5,A lavishly illustrated introduction to human origins,"This is a beautiful book --- especially for the beginner. Easy to read, lavishly illustrated, and small enough not to be heavy, it introduces the reader to various ideas we have had about our origins, Darwin's theory of evolution, and the discoveries of various fossil humans. The introductory illustrations are especially striking because they illustrate the way our species has evolved from ape-like beginnings. These illustrations also graphically show the way culture has evolved along with our bodies. I feel this book is invaluable for a student of biology or anthropology, or anyone who wants an comprehensible introduction to a fascinating but complex subject"
1,Don't waste your money.,"There's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks. It's absolute junk. I put it into the cassette player in my car, and the sounds were completely distorted. The voice constantly skips, and the casette sometimes clicks. The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing, and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device. I've tried both sides, but still no avail. I plan on returning it if shipping doesn't cost more than the product itself."
2,If it were only in stereo,"I purchased this and then returned it. It sounded great...on the left side of my car. There was no sound on the right at all. When I would turn the speaker balance all the way to the right, there was still no sound. I tried this with my CD player and an MP3 player. Same problem. I don't recommend this item."
1,"I was not working, when I received it.","I received the package on time, but to shock, it was not working. To test if my Car casette player was not working, I put my friend's adaptor and that worked. This is just a piece of junk that I bought.I did not want to go through the pain to talk to amazon and pay for the return the more price than I bought it in.I may be the rare unlucky one to get a non-working piece, and it may be good for others, but I can only talk about me.If this review really matters to amazon, then they should compensate it to me."
1,Product Rip-Off,I recently purchased this item and when I first received it I looked at it and thought I don't think this is going to work...And sure enough it doesn't work. I have tried the tape adapter in mulitple tape players and it just will not work!! I didn't pay much for it so I guess you get what you pay for!! I know better next time!!
3,Very informative!,I found this film very educational. The history of the so called Ancient Astronauts was very entertaining and educational. I recommend this DVD to anyone who has questions on the Extra terrestrial and how they evolved in our world.
5,Provides a new way to analyze your garden.,"I recommend this book if you are looking for a new approach to what might be called the garden metaphor. This book provides wonderful definitions of the garden and the importance of place, but also gives practical ways to analyze faults as well as checklists and questions to help gardeners pinpoint where they might want to go. I found it helped to diagnose my problem areas and also pointed to some not so radical solutions that changed emphasis just enough to give my garden a whole new look. I highly recomment it."
2,Thin gruel,"This book would be perfect for serving fish and chips -- once you're done eating you can peer through the greasy pages for some post-lunch empty calories. not much here -- these fellers have essentially been nuked by The Onion and their work is kind of ""Onion for Dummies"" -- something as necessary as owning a home yogurt maker. Time for these lads to get some real jobs -- their ""modern humor"" has the distinct whiff of old hatband."
4,"safe, secure","I'm in the military so carry on luggage isn't always an option. This Pelican case has solved the worry of ""Is my laptop OK underneath that?"" or ""I hope that waterproof bag really IS waterproof"" There's room inside for my Macbook, the power cable and even an external HD. As for the case itself, it fits inside of a regular size backpack or alice pack or whatever."
2,disappointed,disappointed since the cd was scratched since it skipped. notified shipper with no action
1,Disappointed in Service,"I ordered the Daniel O""Donnell Christmas Tape for my parents before Christmas, and 5 weeks later had to order another one because they never received it. Then I ordered another one and had it delivered to them in Ct. and when they opened it, there was no CD at all in it!! My mother called me to let me know, they actually thought it was a joke, it was all wrapped like it was brand new, but no tape inside. I didn't know who to complain to, so I just took it as a loss, and will never order another item again. Very disappointed."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!,"There just aren't enough words to describe the way my heart feels when this man sings!His voice is just wonderful and soooo easy on the ears to. :)I have many (including this Christmas one) of his albums and listen to him daily, especially his""Song of Inspiration"".If your into a tenor voice he is the choice to make.Rose McCreary"
5,Loved this book but was lost,"I read the first book in the series, bound in darkness. I loved the first book and I discovered Dark Angel at my local Barnes and Noble. I immediatly began reading Dark Angel and about 1/2 way through the book, I felt extreamly lost and had no idea what was going on as new characters Siobahn and Tristan were introduced. Also, I kept reading about Isabell and Orlando being in Kivar's clutches. ""WHAT?"", I thought. Then I realized I stupidly skipped the second book in the series. With most series, you can skip certain books and still understand what is going on due to the backround information the author provides. In this series, that is not the case. I loved this book, but I wished I had read the second book first so I did not feel lost. A WORD TO THE WISE: read these books in order and please do not skip around. This series is worth it! ENJOY!"
1,Not as promising as I thought ...,"I was disappointed in this book. Vampire Princess meets knight who will break the curse for her kind; the summary was so promising, but I found the characters of Roxanne and Gareth flat and unappealing. I was bored in the first three chapters alone. I was not able to finish it."
2,a let down..,"I'm a bit disappointed. First, the document clip will only hold a single sheet of paper or a very light pamphlet. Even then, the document weight will occasionally pop off the clip attaching it to the screen. Second, the clip holding this product to my laptop screen is spring loaded plastic and very tight (yet not at all secure - a rubber or foam grip would've helped). I rarely use this product because I'm afraid this clip might damage the screen on my powerbook. Third, it is difficult to illuminate the document without washing out the screen."
2,They all sound the same!,"The same chord progression is used in like every song, as standalone songs these songs are decent enough but who can listen to the same song 21 times in a row!"
2,be careful,"was not exactly what I expected, some of the numbers are very good, others I could do without"
4,Boogie woogie,Delivery time on this was very slow I received products that a ordered a week after ordering this and received them in just 4-5 days. I haven't listened to this yet. I'm playing christmas music right now!!!
2,Not Even for Dummies,"The Dummies routine is becomimg a bit tiresome. This book offers very little to the user, besides simple processes that most people could figure out on their own.I once advocated the benefits of the ""Dummy"" line of books - but more and more - it appears to me that the authors and editors are just Cntrl-X/Cntrl-V(cut and pasting) parts of other books into the newer ones.If you want to get your feet wet and not expose yourself to a wonderful program - buy this book.But if you want to see the power of Star Office - look elsewhere and be brave and pick up a non-dummy/idiot book."
1,quick to crack,"My first grader plays with one of these balls every day, and is very disappointed to see them start to crack after less than two months. He is very diligent to keep them out of sun or rain, yet they haven't held up for very long. We have had to throw away 4 out of the 6. Champion made my son sad. :("
5,Great quality balls,"These are the ones you remember from the school yard when you were a kid. Solid construction and don't feel like they'll fall apart in short order. Kids have been beating these up for some time already, with no issues. Great multi-color pack here, too - everyone will get a color they'll like."
5,Excellent,Great!! I bought these for my daughters 1st grade class! Her teacher says they are just wonderful!! Excellent price!! I shopped around this was the best price for the amount of balls and the quality!
1,horrible product!!!!,Do not waste your money! The balls all crack the first time they are played with. It looks like a good buy but it's a waste.
2,The balls do not last long,"I bought 24 of these balls to give away as party gifts at a kickball birthday party. I stacked them in a nice pyramid and the kids seemed to like them. The ones that my boys and the neighbor kids brought home did not last very long at all. They warped or leaked. Good idea for a party favor, but not these particular balls."
3,Inexpensive but you get what you pay for.,"If you only plan on using these for a week then they are perfect. However, they all started going flat and falling apart. Build quality just wasn't there. I wouldn't recommend them."
1,All six are leaking and unusable after 3 months of light use,"I had high hopes for these! We home-school and so I wanted some tough, school yard type balls for the kids to play with. It made a great present for the kids because these look like giant gum balls. But after only playing with them a few times - here in California it rains most of January, February and March, they are all useless. Perhaps these were sitting around in a shelf and the plastic or vinyl dried out?I wrote to the store but had no reply. These are headed straight for the landfill, so sad."
3,so far - so good,"They look good but not exactly what we expected & were unable to use them, so they are in the box uninflated, waiting..."
2,Poor Quality,"Out of the 6 balls I received, not one of them are round. Even when gently inflated, the oblong nature of these balls is immediately clear. After use on the playground the warping/bulging is even more pronounced. My students can no longer use these balls after only 2 months because they do not bounce straight."
1,Didn't last even a month!,"These are NOT playground balls! Playground balls can handle... um... the wear and tear of the playground. We bought this set for our kids to use in the backyard - not even the daily use they would get in a school playground. Well, after less than a month's time (probably less than a week's worth of use if they were at a school), two of them have holes, and the others are splitting. No, we didn't overinflate either. We have other balls that have lasted us years. Don't waste your money on these."
1,"Very disappointing for outdoor use, did not hold up.","I was encouraged to purchase these balls by the high number of positive reviews. Unfortunately, our experience was in the one-star category. They simply did not hold up to outdoor use for us. They quickly developed cracks, the colors faded, and they became unusable. We were careful to put them in a ball-bin after use, and so it wasn't like they were left outside for weeks in the sun. We live in a dry, moderately high-altitude climate, and it seems like they have about zero UV resistance. Maybe okay for indoor use, or use in a humid, shaded environment ... but we won't be buying them again."
5,Sweet!,"These balls are excellent quality! They arrived at my house 24 hours after ordering, and Ive been getting great use out of them with no problem! We use these for an adult dodgeball league and they hold up great!"
2,"Poor Quality, Beautiful Ballerina","If I had know the recording quality of this performance was so poor I wouldn't have order it. Bad camera Production, out of focus at times, and unnecessary close-ups of the dancers.Save the Close-ups for the Bonus features not the actual performance."
4,"descent wires, nothing special...so far","i got to install this set yesterday to replace the aged regular ngk set i have on my 96 civic hatch. they are a bit longer than the OEM specs but not so much to be a problem. installation is just normal... nothing special versus OEM..meaning its easy. after installation, we go to start up... engine started up ok. i didnt notice anything special..engine sound the same... cold idle speed pretty much the same. road test...was yet to be done... i installed this last night and im too lazy to go out for a spin...so maybe i will edit this later on. again... descent.. nothing special so far.Update:No problems with the car running on these wire set. Was able to drive it for nearly 2 weeks and close to 300mi, didn't encounter any problem.For the price, these are good replacement for your worn out wire set."
4,Fast paced and lots of fun,"This game is extremely enjoyable in its short lived, 7-10 hour, single player campaign.The guns and blade moves all look terrific, especially her blood lust and slo-mo vision. The game is very gory and some of the slow motion death scenes are so over the top theyll make you laugh.However, what keeps this game from 5 stars is its repetitive gameplay, 3 settings and each level on the same setting is very similar, and its short gameplay. The game will take you 2-4 days to beat and sadly there isnt much replay value.But for its cheap price the game cannot be beat in terms of its quick and satisfying play."
5,dot it,"Having become educated in the field of political and social issues of justice, it was with great academic delight that Dawn Marcell's book came into my personal collection. Even more so, was it a greater pleasure to have met with her and conversed about the contents of her writting. She is a very rare and gifted author in that she is as genuine and dedicated to the education of the common person's betterment as anyone I have had the good fortune to meet.I URGE you, Amazon, to do everything within your power to promote this extremely powerful and revealing book. It has the potential of informing the common person of the truth that is so often covered up in our daily media. The American citizen needs to know what Dawn Marcelle has experienced."
3,Beautiful...but hold on to your receipt,"I love this watch case but I was surprised that it just stopped working after 6 months. It was still under warranty and they replaced it. They sent the ""newer"" model and I'm hoping they've fixed the issue. Make sure to hold on to the reciept if you buy it. You may need it."
3,Drama,The UPS guy did not bring it up to my apartment which is one floor up from the ground floor - he left it on the ground floor. Mind you I paid for shipping. The top shelf was chipped - being black furniture it was the first thing we noticed after taking it out of the box. The assembly was not easy. The instructions were confusing and there were more parts than I wanted to count. It looked better on the website than t did after it was assembled.
1,Don't waste your money,I guess you can't expect to get the hand-carved dresser of your dreams for $150 but COME ON - I certainly didn't expect drawer handles that were made of plastic. This rates up there with the top ten worst things I've spent my money on. Very cheap for the price tag.
2,Missing Parts,"Well the dresser should look ok once it is put together, but I have yet to find that out because I missing parts. They sent me the proper quantity of draw sides BUT they sent me 12 lefts sides instead of 6 right and 6 left ALSO the senter piece wasn't even the right color, it was walnut. Who packs these boxes anyway? I'd love to get paid for not doing my job correctly, what a life....<br /><br />Lauren"
5,"A better title would be ""How to play certain Heart songs""","I loved this DVD! I am a HUGE Heart fan and I liked the interview along with lessons on her guitar style. If you are looking for a basic ""how to play guitar"" DVD, this one is NOT for you. If you are curious as to how Nancy developed her style (hence the interview), and then lessons on how she played certain Heart songs, then this IS for you. I especially love the intro to ""Crazy on You"" and ""Mistral Wind."" Nancy has a very pleasant and playful personality on this DVD!I thought that the booklet that comes with the DVD was a BIG bonus!! So worth the $17.99!!!!"
3,It's a good value for the price,"I've purchased a few guitar dvd instructional videos from amazon and I was quite surprised to find one by Nancy Wilson. I recently ordered it, went through it, and found that (for the price) it is a good value.Nancy is very mellow when teaching the material. She shares some very useful tips on tuning and it was very cool to see how the guitar parts for a couple of my favorite songs are put together. A new player will get a lot of info out of this dvd.If you're a more experienced player, you'll find this a good value just for learning ""Dog and Butterfly"" and ""Crazy on you."""
4,A true voice,"Mia Doi Todd shares evocative details of a life carefully observed (and experienced). Heartbreaking and haunting, wonderful imagery, and intellectual, too. All the human themes are present: remembering a lost love, fear of love not lasting, powerlessness and survival."
4,Goddess of empty spaces.,"Todd punctuates her crystalline voice and the elegant simplicity of her guitar with silences, lulls, pauses and breaths that are more devastatingly effective than any backing band could ever be. Her songs are intricately crafted, charming and premeditated. Yet her dancing background serves her well as she tranforms her careful compositions into natural, seemingly effortless works of natural beauty."
2,Disappointing,"Having liked Manzanita a lot, I started buying up the Mia Doi Todd catalog. This is her first album, recently re-released. Based on the sound of Manzanita, I was really expecting a pure, simple, melodic album from an emerging talent. Instead, I found most of this a little hard to take, and a little weird (and it takes a lot to weird me out). She's trying really hard to avoid songwriting conventions, but she doesn't accomplish much in the process, in my opinion. Check out Manzanita or Golden State instead; buy this one only if you're really curious."
1,"So much confidence, so little consequence.","A feat of rabid and bizarrely calculated self-indulgence, which moves from the irritatingly specific to the ridiculously profound. Only a Yalie could foist these adolescent embarassments on anyone with a straight face. Unbearable live."
1,Horrific music--it's even worse performed live.,"mia doi todd's music would best be enjoyed by people who think inaccessibility and quirky musical mannerisms equal meaningful genius.Give me Catpower, Kristen Hersh or Joni Mitchell any day (incidentally, the reviewer who likened Todd's music to Mitchell's is obviously a moron).Be advised, steer clear of her live shows as well--unless you are mean spirited enough to find the (inadvertant) humor in her performances."
4,Great first time camera,I bought this camera a few months ago and love it. It takes great pictures and loads to the PC easily. Only draw back is theres no zoom lens. Take a look at the pictures taken with it in my webshots pages: [website]
2,"Bad battery life, poor driver support, serial only...","I got this for Christmas a couple years ago. The first thing I disliked was the battery life -- I'd run out by the New Year. Plus, Polaroid didn't keep up on writing drivers when Windows 2000 came out (though there is Linux/FreeBSD support via gPhoto), and the green view-finder light is annoying. Now I have a white iBook and there's basically no hope for compatibility, as my camera only came with a serial cable (not a USB cable). Polaroid's recent Chapter 11 filing probably means I won't get Mac OS X drivers any time soon (though Apple may come through in the next versions of iPhoto). If you work only work on a supported platform and like giving Energizer money, this still isn't the camera for you!"
2,Happy customer unhappy...TWICE,"I am sorry to say this is my third review. The camera changes so much this is necassary. I recieved the camera about a month ago. Read my other reviews for a deeper explanation(happy customer unhappy ones) Here we go: The LCD barely works anymore, most of the time you have to hit the side of the camera just to use the LCD. And when you hit it, the camera goes off, so you have to turn it off then back on. That's all that has changed since I bought it. The picture quality is grainy, reguardless of what anyone says. However, if you shrink the size of the picture to standard 35mm size it is crystal clear. Other than that, everything is okay, I 'll let you know if it changes."
5,THE BEST LITTLE DIGITAL CAMERA IN THE WORLD !,I BOUGHT MY CAMERA TWO YEARS AGO IN A WALL MART STORE . AT THAT TIME I PAID [money] FOR IT ; I HAVE USED THIS CAM. ALOT I TAKE ALL KINDS OF PICTURES WITH IT . I LOVE IT ; I HAVE TWO FRIENDS THAT BOUGHT THE SAME CAM. AFTER THEY SEEN PICTURES I HAD TOOK WITH IT; NOW I AM E-MAILING YOUR ADD. TO ANOTHER FRIEND WHO IS GOING TO BUY ONE. (I SHOULD BE A SALES LADY FOR YOU )LOLI HAVE THREE MEMORY CARDS AND I KEEP ONE IN MY CAM. ALL OF THE TIME; A VERY GOOD CAM. AT A VERY LOW PRICE;KATHY
1,Dissatisfied,"The camera does not work and it did not come with any of the attachment wires which is the main reason for the purchase. Tried to inquire with the seller with no response. Buying on-line is a gamble, be wary."
2,Sorry I bought it,I am sorry I bought this camera. It is not that simple to use. The camera comes with no instructions. In order to troubleshoot the set-up you must visit the Polaroid website. The camera must be hooked up and on before you can turn on your computer. Also the play mode is delayed @ 1.5 seconds. Polaroid should stick to making instant cameras!!!!!!
2,Happy Customer Unhappy,"I previously wrote a review of 5 stars, I was wrong. This camera drains batteries so quickly it is a joke. In less than 30 minutes you can drain 4 AA batteries, so you must buy at least two sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, however those take 5 hours to charge. The picture quality is not so good, it produces grainy pictures. But don't get me wrong, it does serve it's purpose, on email/www the pictures look fine.The LCD screen has a slow refresh rate but is very usable. In darker places, the viewfinder is blocked by a green ""ready"" light. But outside or in a highly lit room it's great.Buy this camera if it is your first digital camera, or you cannot afford a good one. Overall, this camera is suffice."
1,Literal Garbage,"I bought this camera approximately 2 months ago. After much use, I found this product to be literal garbage; as if someone had literally packaged a piece of garbage and sent it to me. The refresh rate on the LCD is horrible, not even worth using. Sometimes to get the LCD screen to work it is necessary to bang on the side of the camera. The viewfinder is blocked by an annoying green light and is off by a few millimeters. The supplied AA's last only about 15 to 20 mins. If you are unfortunate enough to buy this camera, get rechargeables. The picture quality is horrid at best, pictures turning out grainy and pixelated. Overall, buying a disposable 35mm is a better choice."
4,Great Camera,The Polaroid Digital camera is very easy to use and produces great results. The software that comes with it is alot of fun and makes it even a better deal.
3,Not too shabby,"This is a great product for the price. Yes, the batteries drain a little fast if you use the LCD screen too much. The resolution isn't professional quality, but it works for the average user. If you get an 8 MB SmartMedia card, you can take tons of pictures. Good lighting is a must - a lot of my indoor pictures haven't turned out too good because of dim lighting. I guess the flash is a little weak. Also, we've had a problem with the LCD screen - it stopped working after only a couple months. We had fresh batteries and all, the screen just quit on us. My mother in law had the same problem, but Polaroid replaced the camera for her (she just had to pay for shipping it). We're working on that right now. Recommend a Flash Path 3.5 floppy adapter - it works great for transfering files without messing with cables or anything."
2,Disappointed!:o(,"Im here reading reviews trying to figure how I can email my photos. I hoping maybe its just the SORRY software program that came with the camera. I have aol at home and have yet to figure out how to email my pics. Tried polaroid tech, have to say they were no help what so ever!Ive got a few ideas from other reviews to try when I get home that will hopefully work. One thing for sure I did learn was I need to go purchase rechargable batteries.Unless some of your suggestions work the camera is going back to the store Monday.All its been is one big headache!!"
1,Warning to Macophiles,I haven't had a chance to use the camera yet -- it just arrived in the Christmas Eve mail. I opened the box. Everything was looking good. I played with the camera. Then I read the manual. Windows only. Called Polaroid. I was up a creek. I've ordered Virtual PC in hopes that the camera driver will be compatible. But the solution isn't cheap. Est $180. Hasn't anyone at Polaroid heard of Steve Jobs? Will update my review after I find out if the software fix works. Keep your fingers crossed.
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL!,"Just received the camera today, and maybe it's just my luck,and maybe not, but the LCD Display is not working at all. Once I getmy problem resolved by Polaroid, I'll write another review and let's pray that it is a ""five star"" review! :o)"
3,That green LED,The Green LED in the viewfinder and fast drain of batteries are my only negative comments. I have had the camera for 6 months. It just is easy to use and I love the LCD preview screen. My first digital camera did not have that. The PhotoMax software is OK. I use another software package to store and sort my pictures. I am going to order the 8 M chip to store my Summer vacation shots till I get home
2,I could not agree more,"I bought this book under the pretense that it would help me understand the basics of the microcontroller (I am a design engineer with B.S. in Electronics Engineering Technology. I have programmed many z80s, but I wanted to learn how to program an ""all in one"" microcontroller). The authors does explain the basics of digital theory, microcontroller layout, and integration with the microcontroller quite well, but he totally blows it in the project/programming section. It's like he simply copied someone elses code without any guide to why the code was written in a particular way. Also, if this is a beginners guide to microcontrollers, he needs to change the projects in the book or change the name of the book from beginneer to advanced. There are only three or four projects and they are entirely to complex for the begineer to comprehend. I was extremely dissapointed in this book."
2,Little guidance on what to do with an uncooperative coparent,"This book was wonderfully insightful about how to handle co-parenting on all levels. Yet, it failed to offer ANY suggestions as to what to do with an ex-spouse that was not at all interested in cooperating. ...Maybe in the next edition they will address this very real reality of some divorces..."
3,Not for every situation,This book is geared toward parents who had at one point lived together raising thier child(ren). It does not address parents who separated during pregnancy or who have never raised the child together. Some of the issues addressed in this book are helpful (communication etc.) but overall it gives you the same basic information as every parenting or co parenting class.
4,"An important book, but a new one should be written","I enjoyed this book and bought it to do some research on the history of women within the conservative movement. Just so you know -- it is not really a history book, but contains multiple snippets from interviews given by women who were (and are) influential in the conservative movement. It was nice to get a book about conservative women, in their own voice vs. those written by those who do not understand, or respect the movement. However, as this book was written more than a decade ago, and is not a ""history"" it is perhaps time that a new, updated version is brought to market."
2,Squirrels won't touch it,"My squirrels don't like this at all. They are back trying to get into the bird feeder. However, I gave one to my mom in Ohio and her squirrels love it. Guess California squirrels are too picky.."
3,Good for winter,"The squirrels don't really eat this unless they are very hungry and nothing else around. I feed everything, birds, deer, squirrels. (spoil em really) They will last about 3-4 months!! I use them in winter only. They hold up well in weather, rain, snow, etc, but won't get eaten unless desperate. I have seen the deer sniff at em and nibble a bit only. The same thing goes for the yellow corn ones."
3,I Like it Better than the squirrels,"This heavy and compacted cob may last months. The squirrels sniff and nibble before heading to the bird feeder. I liked it, seemed good,but the squirrels, not so much. I guess I should take a nibble and see? I won't buy anymore unless the squirrels eat this one...."
3,not completely satisfied,"I cut this this up into small slices,to put in squirrel cage,(to live trap squirrels)along with bird seed with black sunflowers,in a small paper cup.the Squirrels did not seem to eat it very much.It might work better in the way the manuf.recommended in a log holder??"
2,"Great idea--if the squirrels didn't keep ""stealing"" them","Purchased in conjunction with the Belle Fleur 50116 Adirondack Chair Squirrel Feeder.Project comes with a pre-drilled hole on either end to screw on to the Feeder.However, in both instances of use, the squirrels ""figured out"" how to unscrew the log from the feeder and cart it away!Each log lasted no more than one night on the feeder. . .and we never did find what the squirrels did with it.This does not seem to happen when using regular corn.For that reason, I cannot recommend this product. Too much to spend for it to have such a short shelf life."
1,thumb's down,My neighborhood squirrel's wont touch these products. Very disappointed but little critter's are probably spoiled from the baseball peanuts I have been feeding them ... back to the drawing board.
3,Disappointed,"Very disapointed, the squirrels do not like this as well as the regular squirrelog. I am not sure if it the flavor or maybe my squirrels do not have a sweet tooth."
5,This CD ROCKS!,"I like the snappy drums, the smooth guitar licks and the high energy bass. The tambre of Joe's voice is pleasing to listen to and the lyrics are crafted like a Spider's web. This is great music for driving. I recommend that everyone keep a copy of this CD in their car - a MUST HAVE."
4,small town band makes good,"debut albums say a lot. while others have gotten lost in endless editing, pound & beers has maintained the integrity of their live performances. and quite simply, created an alubum that their fans are going to love.i fell in love with this band the first time i saw them perform. and though you may not have had the opportunity to see this energetic group play live (yet), i'd invite you to take a listen.these guys have offered up a truly inspired and imaginative album in a time when so much of today's music has become bland and bubble gum."
2,"Does not handle two 590 in SLI, 1200w PSU",I bought this for my main gaming machine and it does not work with two nvidia 590 SLI cards and 1200w PSU. I unplugged the computer and tried other devices and it works just fine. I believe the 1500w power rating is false or I have a defective unit.
2,Tech specs not well documented in product description.,"I have been reviewing a UPS device for use in a third world country, to bridge the gap between a full generator set and rechargeable lamps. Because my electricity service is very erratic and prone to brownouts, and blackouts I need a reliable source of electricity to keep at the minimum, the lights on, and the computer network running to power the VOIP phone system.The tech specs do not specify if the device will work with 220-240 volts and 50-60 hertz electricity. Nor des it specify if there is a alarm or amp hour rating of the battery backup."
5,great book,I love it. I bought this one for my 5 year old and he is not in Kindergarten yet but he is a capable home schooled child. The book it's easy but I like the critical thinking this book has to offer !
5,Daily Math Practice Grade 1,"I love these books. Repetition is key with young ones, and these seem to cover everything they need to know. I have been very pleased with the content."
4,Fantasy meets chick lit.,"I read this book a while ago and I really enjoyed it.I like books like this... with a fantasy element or twist on reality. It really makes what could have been an average book really stand out from the rest.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. If you like chick lit, even better."
3,Great beach read,"I was looking for something I could read on the beach for one weekend, and I got just that.The story is cute and interesting enough to keep me reading. It's not terribly deep and there seems to be some holes in the plot you can drive a truck through, but whatever. A good 6-hour escape."
2,"Don't expect oo much, and you won't be dissapointed","Well it was a charming little read; fun, creative, yet hardly up-to-snuff with what I would consider intelligent writing. I liken the level of writing to just-out-of-highschool, (maybe freshman college.) I do not expect to see a ""Best seller"" title on this one. But again, it was a fast, fun little bit of writing. I reccomend it for perhaps taking a break from serious reading, just some mindless humor and easy-to-follow story."
1,SHALLOW!,"ok, so I didn't expect depth, but there was a day when even the Smurfs put out a holiday album that wasn't total crap like this one is!it is more than shallow, it is short & painfully secular!there is NOTHING Christmas about this, except for the overtly PC songs..."
4,I found this book interesting...,"I found this book interesting, especiallythe 12 pages of book titles attributed to beingin Bruce Lee's ""library"".Really gives a snap shot of Bruce Lee's thoughts by understandingwhat he read and his thought processes.Bruce made it very clear that in the end individualexpression, self knowledge and a journey of questioningwas the path he wished those who wanted to follow hispath to follow.We are all on that path (journey of life) and it isdifferent for each of us.Thomas Keplar"
1,Do not recommend!,"Crimped about 30 or so RJ45's after that many of the pins on the RJ45's did not depress into the wires. It was also random at times, properly crimping pins and then not. Leaving one, two or three pins up. Recrimping would sometimes help but not always. Purchased an Platinum Tools EZ-RJ45 Crimp Tool and no more issues. Do not recommend."
3,Debbie Allen's Special Look,"Back in the days, Ms. Allen was a serious choreographer, i.e. Fame. In fact, she taught Janet Jackson how to dance when she started out with her self title LP, ""Janet"" i.e. ""Come give your love to me."" Both Debbie Allen and Michael Peters, bless his heart, he's no longer with us, are the best choreographers. Anyway, I heard ""Special Look"" back in 1987; it grew on me, though I didn't know it was Debbie Allen with the help from Kashif. If you want to dance your ass off, like I did, I highly recommend you get this CD. You choose your tracks. We all have a ""Special Look."""
3,just for fun,The Cd is not so good. But the Title track is fun. It was a child hood memory. I loved the video to the song.
3,Modifications needed,This item is installed but some modifications were needed. Two of the mounting points we not lining up right so I had to bend the bracket to mount it. After that it installed easily. There is a small gap at the bottom where it meets the original compartment. If your not picky it should the job
1,Sony BCV615 Camcorder/Mavica Battery Charger for DCRVX2100 and HDRFX1,"This I can not recommend. Although the price and shipping fees were reasonable and the item arrived on time, it does NOT work. I own one already and I know how to use it properly. I have attempted to use it to charge multiple batteries and it will NOT charge them at all. The unit is supposed to charge a battery until fully charged, then turn off automatically. It does not do this. When plugging a battery into it, it lights up indicating that it is charging. However, after charging 2 different batteries for over 12 hours each, it neither charged the batteries nor turned off as it is supposed to do. I have no problem exchanging the item if the seller contacts me as I do need a second charger, but I definitely need it sent back. I need instructions from the seller on how to proceed. Until the item is returned and credit paid back or the item is exchanged. I can NOT recommend the item or seller positively."
2,2.5/5 stars - Woods has done better!,"Ex-DEA agent Jesse Warden has seen enough of the inside of a solitary confinement cell to last him a lifetime. Or two lifetimes, which is the sentence he's serving after being convicted of a plan he was planning to commit, but never did. So when an old buddy shows up with a deal that could spring him from his hell behind bars, he's ready to listen.To gain his freedom, Jesse must infiltrate a dangerous and reclusive religious cult that has been stockpiling weapons and eliminating those sent to investigate.From the moment he arrives in the Idaho mountain town where the cult is centered, Jesse finds every aspect of life dictated by the group's eerie, imposing leader.The plot is clearly modeled on the Branch Davidian disaster, and while the reader was very good, the story was fairly blah and a bit predictable."
2,A so-so read,"This is the second Stuart Woods book I've read. The first was one of his latest attempts and I was underwhelmed. The main character was not well developed and there was too much ""jumping the shark"" in the plot line. Thought I should give the guy another try so picked up HEAT. The main character, Jessie Warden, was better developed and I actually liked him and thought he was somewhat interesting. The plot line was interesting, but I had this feeling I had seen all this on the nightly news. While this one held my interest better than the first book, it still was not a page turner as some have suggested. This is mind candy and best read when you are killing time in an airport or trapped in a hospital room waiting on a sick relative."
5,I really Enjoyed This Book,"I like his writing style. He's concise and doesn't use a paragraph where a sentence will do.A great plot line, well defined characters all combining to a great ending.A great beach, or airline flight, book."
2,"Not believable, but loved main character","Jesse Warden is an ideal creation. As such, he's too comic book for real life, but I like reading about people of such heroic inclinations and abilities who also like Beethoven. The book however does not live up to Jesse's form. It is a typical infiltrate the evil Nazis in the hills story, the kind of thing I'd expect from television, and is quite similar to a book by Lee Childs. In fact, I think this story is so cut from stereotype that it's fairly tedious and reminds me of the kind of bad television that's on late at night and you watch because you're sick and bored and feeling sorry for yourself. Woods writes well, but not compellingly. Read the first four chapters to learn about Jesse, then head for the hills, because after that it turns into saccharine candy and cliche."
3,a one hit wonder,"this is a good album,but the song that stands out the most is on christ the solid rock i stand.when i first heard that song i could not believe the vocal arrangements of the choir. simply outstanding. too bad it's the only song on the album that i really like,but you get what you pay for."
1,Not worth the Effort,"I read this book for my book group. I found it boring, the descriptions unrelatable, the characters mostly cursory and the writing almost insulting in the way it explains every little thing to the reader. I forced myself to finish this book, but really wish I hadn't. Although it was interesting to see the way the plot points tied together, I truly wasn't all that interested to find out. I could easily have put it down in the middle and forgotten all about it. I found myself skipping over useless descriptions of people and locations that were irrelevant to the story and added nothing. The story could have been told in half the pages. There were poignant insights and descriptions that were enlightening, but they were rare. I'm shocked to see so many people liked this book."
5,An amazing read,"As an avid reader for more years than I care to count, and as a former teacher of creative writing, I cannot praise The Sixth Lamentation enough. It is a remarkable blending of a modern, harsh story told in truly classical prose. I was fully enveloped in the suspense of the action while continuing to be overwhelmed by the beauty of the writing style. My immense admiration for this author is equalled only by my intense desire to read more of his work."
2,2006 Hummer H3,"Don't buy this product(HUMMER OWNERS) it just doesn't look good with a hummer H3 interior, maybe you could mod it, but it sticks out a little far. Maybe it's just personal preference ?"
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR HUMMER H3,"THIS DASH KIT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD ON A HUMMER H3. THE H3'S ORIGINAL STEREO AND CONSOLE IS A BIT ROUNDED. THEREFORE, THE TWO SIDES OF THE UNIT STICK WAY OUT AND DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AT ALL. I ALSO HAD TO TRIM THE PLASTIC A LOT. DO NOT BUY FOR YOUR HUMMER H3!"
1,Useless,"The book provides many samples of code that is incorrect. You spend more time debugging the books code then the learning of the lesons themselves. I could see it's usefullness if you already know actionscripting, but isn't the purpose of this book to teach it."
5,Amazing cameras,"I bought 2 of these to replace the standard cameras that came with my CCTV system. The field of view on these is almost triple what I could see with the default cameras. The colors are sharp and it performs beautifully in low light (much better than the so-called ""night-vision"" cameras that came with my system). These made the difference in turning my CCTV system from just a toy to a useful security and monitoring system. With just 2 of these under the front eaves of my house I can view the front door, entire front yard, and driveway."
1,NOT weatherproof!,Bought this camera for outdoor use since it was advertised as weatherproof. One rain and it was full of water. I am sure it would be good indoors but not outdoors.
3,As desired,"I bought this camera to replace an IR camera in my apartment window watching over my motorcycle while I'm at work. Price, shipping time, condition, and qualities, of the item were all as desired. The picture is not as high a quality as I would like, but there are few cameras anymore that are not IR. IR cameras looking through a glass window at night don't work so well, and I cannot mount the camera outside (apartments). It satisfies my desire (day and night surveillance), and connected as expected to my DVR setup."
1,Botties,The company that sends these are extremely slow.I think the S&H; is outragous. I will not use thiscompany again.Amazon you need to drop them!!!!!!
4,Sturdy protection,"Very good rugged protection for the D60 and improved grip handling and not to mention the over-all appearance of the camera. The lens armor is a little awkward though, couldn't figure out how to put it on a nikkor d60 105mm lens."
4,Good Protection,Really good sturdy housing for the camera. The lens protector is too bulky and actually casts a shadow when you use the flash. I dont use that part of the protector.
4,Great item!,Shipping slow! But armor is great! Easy to put on camera body. Lens protector falls off easy going in and out of camera bag. Haven't used camera much since putting Armor on. Someones review has cure for lens problem. Would buy from this seller again.
5,Great and inexpensive,"This is a great external hdd enclosure. Does the job. Was what I expected, good that it has an indicator light."
4,Rider in the Mist,"I'm not a huge fan of suspenseful novels, but they're growing on me...as long as it is a romantic suspense ;)Anyway, I thought to book was pretty good! It wasn't my favorite, but it kept me entertained. I liked the interactions between Aurelia and Marcus and some of the other characters as well. The characters had a good depth, which I'm not sure was developed fully...but I don't write, so I don't know a whole lot about that. I think some of their past could have changed their interactions a little bit, especially for Aurelia's character. Overall, I enjoyed the book though!"
4,Good Product,"Microphone records as promised, excellent sound, great quality. Price is reasonable, unfortunately, shipping and handling almost doubles total cost..."
3,NOT WHITE LIKE PICTURE,"I wanted a white mic, but it's black. It works just fine, though. Don't like deception."
3,"Christmas swings, Texas style!","If you like Texas swing, you'll like this one. I would have preferred a few more traditional songs, though. The Brazos Valley Boys are a fantastic band and really prove it on this one."
4,Let's party!,"This group takes Haitian music to another level. They combine the popular Haitian compas, with rap and reggae. I dare you to get this Cd and to not start dancing!! The group does an interesting cover of Michael Jackson's classic, ""The Girl is Mine."" My favorite tracks, are the Kanaval tracks. There are 3 of them on this disc. It makes me wish I could be in Haiti, celebrating Carnival myself!! I prefer when the group sings in their native Haitian Creole. I just think it is prettier. But, there are many tracks in English. If you really want to dance the night away, get this!!"
3,exciting moments and a motley bunch of vicious characters,"Catspaw Ordeal"" is a decent thriller, with some exciting moments and a motley bunch of vicious characters. The main character here, Danny Archer, is nicely presented and likeable enough. Edward S Aarons is always solid when it comes to plot, character, and dialogue. His main strength, though, is his ability to inject tension and excitement into a scene. Near the halfway point in ""Catspaw Ordeal"" there is a very well written scene set in the parking lot of an amusement park. It is only a few pages long, but it serves to highlight how great Aarons can be. If there were more moments like this one, this would have been one of Aarons' best books."
3,not sure..,"what to think.This is a really strange account! I'm not saying it's not true,at least not from the author's point of view.I'm only saying I really don't know what to think."
4,I believe,I'm going to keep my review of this book short and simple because I believe thats what does this book the most justice. I believe. I believe every word in this book and I have no doubt that it all happened.I know from personal experience that things like this are indeed real and happen all the time .Books like this are sorely needed to introuduce that fact into the public conciousness and let people who have experienced such things know that they are not alone. This is a lovely touching story and I'm glad the Author shared it with us.
5,Very nice,"I am not into religion that much, but I got this book for Christmas and it was very interesting and insightful...The pictures are great (love the colors) and everything about and around Shiva is very fascinating and enlightening..."
5,eye shadow,"Thankyou, it had become hard to find this excellent product.Still hunting for a pale grey matt eyeshadow. I cannot wear shiny products."
4,Good for a base,"My grandma actually bought this in Vintage Lace because she wanted something light and later decided to give it to me since she wasn't wearing much makeup anymore. I am usually not a huge fan of matte shadows but I figured I would give it a try since it was free and would just be thrown away if I didn't use it. I tan on a regular basis so just wearing this alone would be very frightening on me. Through experimenting I found that this is the perfect base for my eyelids. It goes on smoothly, blends well, and prevents my other shadow from creasing. I am sure it would look fine on someone with a more fair complection but I think it works great as an eyeshadow base. I would recommend it just for that fact alone. It also works for just a touch of color on the brow bone under the brows and is more wearable for everyday since it is not shimmery or shiney for work. Can't beat the Amazon price either:)"
1,Check Speco website,Check the Speco website. Buying from Amazon (as well as a whole bunch of others) voids the warranty. I don't own this so my star rating is not a valid picture. Just letting you know Speco does not honor the warranty if you don't buy from an authorized dealer.Great way to get your product out Speco and fabulous customer service!
1,A total disaster,I bought 2 cables like this. Neither one worked form day one. I got mad and went to Best buy and spent $30 for the same cable and now it's working. I do not advice anyone to buy it.
5,Coordinator of Client Services - Glide Memorial Church,"As a social worker in San Francisco running vocational training programs, the first thing we do is try to get our unemployed clients to perceive their situations in the most positive light possible - not always an easy task. The generous stack of books that the author herself presented to our organization in hopes of alleviating some of the above mentioned stress have been of great help with this daunting task.Personally, after thumbing through the chapters, I have not only over come any fear of losing my job in the environment of layoffs and downsizings, but now secretly await my own ""Time Off!"" - don't tell my boss."
3,Time Off! The Unemployed Guide to San Francisco,"Please note: This book contains an error. When visiting the Koret Health & Recreation Center, the Red Pass ONLY allows you access before 2pm (Monday-Thursday) and anytime on Friday-Sunday. You can NOT attend a group exercise class if time restrictions apply."
3,Reusable LCD Screen Protector for M600i,"PROS: Sticks on, stays on. Really reusable. Instructions on how to clean are included. Squeegy and cleaning cloth come in handy.CONS: The screen was initially hard to apply and instructions were not too clear. It's great that the screen is reusable because otherwise I would not have it now from the many times I attempted to place it on the screen. Bubbles will accumulate easily under the screen."
4,"good read, missing original characters though.","I've been a huge fan of the Fearless series every since I got the first book free with an Alloy order. I was really sad when I finished Gone. I don't really like how this new series starts when Gaia graduates college, because it doesn't really fill you in on what she did during her college time. And I really miss the original characters. I really hope Ed somehow comes back. There is a new romance, but Gaia and Ed are just right. But, it was a good read, just as fun and as has much wit as the original Fearless series. Fans will miss the original characters, though."
4,Out to prove herself,"In this series sequel to the orignial Fearless series, Gaia is now a college graduate. She is training to be an FBI agent.Gaia thinks the training will be easy, but is she wrong. She does well in the timed course, but not so well in the real life simulation. And to make training even harder, there's a cute boy intrested in her. And believe it or not he's a farm boy who is forcing her to give it her all. Instead of helping other people, she has to help herself. After messing up one too many times, Gaia gets kicked out. Using her own smarts, she gets back in on probation. She can only become a trainee again if she and her group can solve the murder in the reaistic simulation.I liked this novel, but was disappointed that none of her friends from the oringinal series was in it. I reccomend it to preteen and teens."
2,Memoirs are supposed to impact!,"With this review I don't want to say that Frank Mc Court`s life did not show any depth or meaning; just that the book should have shown it. Who cares how many women he slept with, or why they fought about? we care if the character learned;however, he keeps narrating events, almost no feelings, never any lessons. That's what you live for: to learn. It was suppossed to show the rising from a pathetic life, but it was more like passing to one way of living pathetically to another. And it was supposed to inspire me to fight for what I want. If my life depended on the quality of the writing or the story, I would have been already dead. PS: I bought this book for $5 in a bookstore. Why bother paying $20?"
2,Got a lot of money?,"This book has beautiful photos of very lovely Japanese-style homes, but I wouldn't say that it's full of ideas for how to find more space in your home, or how to easily incorporate Japanese design or features into your already existing home. I would say if you have a lot of money, a lot of space, and at least some land, you could use this book to rebuild and create the perfect Japanese home. And you're going to have to get rid of all (and I mean all) the tchatchkes, or else cram them all in your new storage space. Which is not a bad idea for us Americans (getting rid of them, that is). I would like to see a book with ideas on how to use Japanese interior design ideas to help create more space and beauty in any home, using the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi."
3,Japanese Architecture,"I just received my copy of this book a day ago. I was frankly a little disappointed. The book is well made but for me, ultimately unsatisfying. The rooms are traditional Japanese as I had hoped, but the photos while in color, are typically small and done in a non-glossy printing process that makes the colors look muted and dull. There is lot of detail in B&W drawing form of Shoji screen and Asian light-fixture designs. Still, I think the book cries out for bigger photos, glossier color, and a sense of life. Curiously, these are some of the things that are most notable in Japanese architecture. The rooms seem static and lifeless. It's not a bad book but it could have been done better so far as the photography is concerned."
3,A Japanese home - authentic,"The title of ""A Japanese Touch for your home"" is misleading. Don't expect a set of advice on how to add Japanese-style details to your home interior. Rather, this is a detailed guide of creating an authentic Japanese home, using the correct dimensions and materials. Starting from the use of shoji to how to built a room for the tea ceremony, from the entranceway to veranda - it's all there with pictures and plans.I am not sure if many people outside Japan would really go that far as to build a real Japanese house, but it is certainly an enlightening and interesting book, giving you a perspective of a culture and a way of life."
4,A Japanese Touch for your Home,"Primarily a picture book, but beautifully illustrated with abbreviated but clear, if rather journalistic, text. As advertised."
5,A picture is worth a thousand words,"This book has truly inspired and guided us in several aspects of design of a new contemporary house. As the credit card advertisement states, ""priceless.""The book is also quite attractive. It is not, as others have noted a how-to guide."
3,"Reasonable production, but strange selection","Playboy has always promoted itself as displaying ""the girl next door"" so I guess this project was an obvious one. No doubt many of the respondants were glamor-model-wannabes and given the pay rates they must get at Walmart who can blame them? I wonder about the selection criteria for the finalists presented here, though. I'm not a fan of tattoos, depilation and shall we say ""attachments"" - if you are then this is for you, but frankly I think the finalists look sexier with clothes on than with them off. A pity at least a photo gallery of other contest entrants wasn't included."
2,"Sorry, but I'm not falling for it","I don't know what Walmart these girls came from, but the ones I've been to only seem to staff homely, short, fat, goblin-like women. I smell a deception here. There's absolutely NO WAY IN H*LL that girls which look like this would have such a job. You'd find them working at espresso booths or something, where all the babes seem to be.I think in this case PLayboy is appealing to our ""fantasies"" of seeing ""regular girls from Walmart-type jobs"" naked, but they couldn't possibly have found such quality at one of the actual stores."
5,"Love Me, Tracie!!","""Love Me"" (my fav from this set) alone is worth getting this album.Strong beginning (""This House"") and actually, this album rides right along nicely with ""Save You Love"", the first single then dips into the sensual groove with ""Tender Kisses"" without un-packing any dance floor all while making a consious statement about homelessness and interracial dating with the video for ""Tender Kisses"". ""This Time, (Make It Funky)"" marks Tracie's 'rapping' debut, but as fun and dancable as the song is, hopefully she won't be doing a Michael Jordan/Baseball move. And of course, we wind down to the ""Love Me"" which is sure to pack more bedrooms than dancefloors (as it did when I was hanging out listening to R&B; with my friends in 1992). The music arrangements alone grab you before being fully embraced by the suductive delivery of Ms Spencer while still a minor. Classic R&B; love song!!Pick this CD up NOW!! Tracies best set yet!!"
3,Tender kisses!,"WOW, Tender Kisses was GREATTTTTTTTTTTT! What ever happen to Tracy Spencer? That one song alone, along with the video is the BOMB, diggity! :-)"
3,Make The Difference,"I agree with the previous poster that Tracie Spencer was a young lady who did not promote an overly-sexualized image to sell records, instead she hit us with that powerful voice that I fell in love with during her run on 'Star Search'. I'll never forget her heart tugging version of IMAGINE and how excited I was to see that translate into a recording career for her. Tracie has pure singing ability like her contemporaries of that era: Shanice & Stacy Lattisaw and these young divas with powerfully mature vocals definitely opened up the doors for the young r&b; divas who followed.This disc features a mix of beautiful ballads & uptempo dance tracks and although some of those tracks sound a little dated to the early '90s, Tracie's vocals make them a lot more interesting to listen to.My favorite tracks are: TENDER KISSES, SAVE YOUR LOVE, YOU MAKE THE DIFFERENCE, LOVE ME, SWEETER LOVE & THIS HOUSE."
5,Excellent,Received fast and in excellent condition. This is exactly what the kids are learning in school and it is a very good review if they already learned how to do the work. I would highly recommend this.
4,Well written but too easy,This is a well written book. The problems are generally easy and hence gives a boost to student's self-confidence.
2,Far below grade level,"I bought this for my son who has struggled with math in the past. I figured this workbook would help him with his math skills. While it is full of problems, I would say this book is geared more toward a first grade student. Many of the concepts he covered in second grade were not covered in the book. This book was mostly comprised of basic addition and subtraction. After a few problems, I have decided to use this book for his brother who is entering first grade this year. If it makes any difference, I live in Central Jersey, and we are in the public school system."
3,Daily Math 2nd grade...too easy for my second graders,"I don't know if my curriculum is too demanding, but I believe this Daily Math 2nd grade is way too easy for them. I would say it's more appropriate for first graders."
3,Looks like my son's 1st grade homework,I was hoping to challenge my son who is in 1st grade with 2nd grade Math since he finds his grade level so easy. My son is scoring at a 50th percentile for Math so its not like he's some whiz kid but this book ended up being too easy also. I guess I will try 3rd grade.
4,Power Tactics of Jesus Christ and other Essays,"An insightful and provocative, albeit pseudocynical collection of essays on psychothrapy, factors that facilitate change, and insight into the minds of change agents. I sgrongly recommend this book and Haley's other writings for people interested in careers in helping people. Haley is not like many writers in this field, and has a facinating point of view for the reasons people behave the way they do and how they can best be helped to redefine their own futures. Not for the timid or squeamish, and try not to be put off by Haley's pseudo-sarcasm; his intent is honorable -- to challenge the thinking of the learning ""helping professional."""
2,Dammit.. can we just have GRAY?,"To the eye this color looks gray, indeed.Unfortunately under studio lights, like Elinchroms (yes, i know about AB colour shifts, hence mentioning of brand), from certain angles it manages to produce all colours of rainbow..Meaning that color was achieved by mixing all sort of stuff, instead of just black and white.What a fun to fix that in postproduction when shooting colour (b&w; is fine for obvious reasons)."
4,Amusing at every level,"The book is not pretentious, nor designed to make you believe in hocus pocus. It seems clear that the author does not give a hoot if the reader believes her or not. She just want to relate very funny and amusing situations which she has gone through, the nature of her magic and some very interesting explanations about white and black magic (no formulas or spells are enclosed as addendum). From then you might draw your own conclusions.Mine remains the same. Life could be very amusing provided you always remember that when conclusions are established, you are running the risk to stop learning. My warm regards to Ms Bourne in case she still around this planet."
4,A Wonderful Road Movie!,"Ana, an educated art historian, and Aurelia, lone mother of two, are two women in trouble, one with the law and the other with drug trafficking thugs. Their paths cross as Ana asks if she can get a ride with Aurelia to Cancun as both attempt to escape their pasts. This is in the backdrop of a vicious serial killer that has murdered over 250 women and haunts all women in Mexico. Without a Trace is a wonderful road movie about the two women as they try to change their lives on their own in the shadow of a patriarchal society. Novaro creates a motherly environment as mother Aurelia breast feeds and nurtures her little baby, but also a tough femme fatale atmosphere with the women drinking beer in different bars. These two aspects of the women are brought to the screen with strong drama and comedy as the women venture for something better. In the end, Novaro creates a wonderful cinematic experience that both entertains and enlightens the audience."
3,Complex and at times confusing,"It's probably due to the fact that I'm not from Latin American nor have I ever been to Mexico (where the movie takes place), but this movie was hard to follow."
5,unfaltering tangibility,"Dean's ""First Course in Turbulence"" was perhaps the first collection of poetry I have ever enjoyed in entirety. I became a devout follower from the moment my brain first sundered his work; and had the recent privilege to hear Dean read from his new collection, ""Skid"". With an amazing gift for florid language, Dean still manages to talk about life in a manner that makes his content accessible to a copious amount of readers. What marks ""Skid"" as unique is perhaps its more personally oriented quality, when compared to previous collections. Dean manages to reveal chunks of his persona along with his commentary on the intricacies of life. Simply said, this is a collection that should adorn your bookshelf."
5,Intuition,"The book was somewhat hard to read because of the way the literature was written. Fuller writes with long sentences and verbs, and made up words. However, it was just very exciting to read and capture the mind of such a creative man. A diffinite keeper on my book shelf. I read it four times."
2,No good,"Kind of a waste of money. This did not fit on my Infiniti G35 with the JDM double din kit. I cut off the center piece now i dont think i could get a refund. It did fit perfect over the HU, but it covered more space than necessary. If you'd like to trim this piece and modify it a little more, maybe it would fit on yours."
2,Cheap,Got this for my 2004 Infiniti G35x. I needed to file it to fit. It is flimsy. I had to remove the middle cross part which was easy but it is just a cheap piece of plastic that was way too overpriced.
1,No on/off switch,These candles do not have an on/off switch. To turn them on you have to screw the bulb on and then loosen the bulb to turn it off. Way too difficult to use. I would not recommend these candles.
3,Good Candle -- weird bulbs,"These are great candles. They stick on the window nicely, and they're long lasting. The only problem is that the light bulb is really blue. We ended up having to buy new bulbs to put in because it looked really funny from outside."
1,battery needs to be replaced after 6 months,There is a manufacturing flaw with this battery. I've own 4 of these batteries and they all died at 6 months. The first 2 batteries came with my drill. My 3rd and 4th battery were received because of the warranty. The guy at Skil that handles the warranty was aware of some problem. I use to own a very old set of 12 Volt Skil drill batteries that last 5 years.
1,Too much for too little,The item was too expensive. The information contained in the advertisement made appears as if you would receive more than one unit. I did not even take the battery from the wrapper just requested a refund and went to a local store to purchase the item for about 60% of the cost. The service provide by Amazon was truly great.
1,Local retailers cheaper...without shipping also,"I come to Amazon to find bargins, however, the prices on these batteries are causing me to second guess the assumption that you get things cheaper online. Lowes, right down the street from me, has these batteries cheaper...and without the shipping cost or wait...what to say? shop around!Skil SB18A 18-Volt NiCad Cordless Slide Style Battery Pack"
2,Poor Batteries - waaayyy overpriced,Worst batteries on the market. Won't hold a charge for more than a few months. These replacement batteries are incredibly over-priced.Why in the world pay $60 for a battery for a $89 dollar drill that came with two of these??!! Ridiculous!
3,great,"I could not find this in the store only the charger, the salesman said they were going to stop caring the brand. I wanted both items so I just purchased them on Amazon for the same price if I had bought them in the store."
2,"Few Diamonds, Mostly Coal","I was quite disappointed with this anthology. The stories written by acknowledged ""masters"" of the genre such as Le Guin, Disch, Kelly and Niven read like the kind of material these talented authors would never dream of submitting. Joyce Carol Oates ""Commencement,"" her first sci-fi story, is extremely well-written but pointless. If I were the editor of this collection, I would have sent the majority of stories back to the authors for rewrites. There are a few gems, however. New writer Laura Whitton's vibrant and challenging ""Froggies"" shows us what might happen if we come to care for another alien species a little too much, and Rucker and Shirley's ""Pockets"" is both mind-bending and terrifying. I just wish Mr. Sarrantonio would have been a bit more discriminating in accepting stories for this collection. Gardner Dozois' yearly collection is the one to read; even on off years, his choices are better than these."
5,great product,great product...i would suggest if you have snakes you use this item because it does not injure your snakes but rids mites
1,Should be named Level 0,"Don't waste your time with this router. Trying to transfer files over a few MBs across the LAN would cause the router to lock up and it would stop passing all traffic. The only thing that would fix it was a power cycle. The router would also lock up and sometimes drop the wireless signal every day or two which would also require a power cycle. Also, channel 6 is the only channel available to use. This thing is a piece... I've tried updating the firmware to no avail. My model was H/W version 3.0."
1,Don't bother,"It arrived broken and I wasn't able to get either a replacement or a replacement part for the missing pieces. After weeks of trhing, It simply wasn't worth the hassle to try and get either, so I settled for a refund, but the entire transaction was unsatisfactory. Too bad, it looked like it might have been a good product, but we'll never know."
1,Good cable... for strangling people,"This is the worst VGA cable I have ever used. I have a 100 ft cable that displays better. Maybe because this cable only has a ferrite core at one end. At any rate, there were horizontal stripes of slightly brighter/dimmer color that would move up the screen, slow down, stop, and then start moving down the screen, ad infinitum.Pros: cable is sturdy, could be used to strangle someone.Cons: if you're not already blind, using this cable will make you want to gouge out your eyes and then strangle yourself."
4,Good video quality cable,"The cable came as expected. The video quality was suprisingly good i was contemplating whether to get hdmi or vga but the video quality of the cable sounds good enough already. There is a few kinks, sometimes the screen will have random lines however that is due to the computer and the screen you have displaying different solutions not because of the cable i suspect. overall good cable for the price would buy this one again if i need another one"
5,Perfect,"This cable serves the purpose I intended it for. The package was fully sealed and there was no confusion in the simplicity of the design. I didn't notice it in the advertisement, but the cable also has an audio jack attached to each male connector.I've been using this cable now for almost several months and I have no problems with it at all. The quality is fantastic on my 32"" LCD and there is no interference or problems to be noted. Overall, an excellent price compared to Best Buy (34.99)and a good quality buy."
4,10 ft monitor cable,"What do you say about a cable? Received in good condition with no visible defects. It plugs in at both ends. Only disappointment is when used there is a visible loss of signal quality but still very usable. I use it often to view movies, etc. from my laptop to my HD monitor. I bought it thru Amazon, a source I find highly reliable with excellent value and purchasing/ordering made simple."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this because I got a computer monitor for free and it did not have a cord. I figured a cheap one would work just fine. Boy was I wrong. The image was wavy and hard on the eyes. I got a different cord and now the monitor works great. This cord does work, just do not expect a great image."
4,GREAT VALUE-You won't be disappointed.,"GREAT VALUE- Anyone looking to get a good VGA cable at a great value, without waiting for them to be on sale, needs to buy this product! Works great and seems to have real quality."
1,Can't use it.,"I tried using this cable with two different systems. With one system the cable seemed to pick up electrical interference so as to significantly distort the image on the monitor, put the older cable back on and everything worked fine.With another system the computer couldn't communicate properly with the monitor, couldn't get the right resolution and could only get half the image on the monitor. Perhaps the signal weakened over the longer cable or perhaps something is wired different or there is a weak connection? Again I put another one of my cables in and everything worked fine.This cable was a waste of money for me."
3,Good item - Lazy Shipping,"The service was so LAZY it was shipped three day after my purchase,So I received the item in the last day.I live in North CarolinaThe shipping took the same time that tookMy iPod 4g arrive From CHINA !!!The product works great!But Don't expect HD like a HDMI cable !!on my HDTV my computer's screen looks really weird."
5,Cable,"Hey, it's a VGA cable and it's 15 feet long!What more could you say about it. it was made correctly, seems to be fairly well built, and it's working."
4,It is...,...what it is. A monitor cord. The price was great and it functions without issue. Great deal great product. No complaints whatsoever.
3,"Low quality coating, working cord","The plastic/rubber coating is kinda thin and weird looking/ old and outdated. Was expecting better quality material. Cord worked, so I'll give this a 3. I'm an aesthetics person. Not only do I want it to work, I want it to look good."
2,BAD SHIELDING,This cable has no 60 Hz rejection and will add noise to your video. I gave mine away and am searching for a better cable.
1,Poor Quality,"After hooking the cord up to an additional monitor, the color on the monitor would change to a different shade, almost a pastel color. I tried it on other monitors just to make sure that the monitor wasn't faulty. The fortunate thing is, that it was cheap. Don't buy."
2,Blurry,"I got this product to connect my TV to my laptop, but when connected to my laptop as well as those of my friends, there is a double image, a smear to the right of the pictures, which makes things difficult to see, and isn't clear at all. Perhaps it's the fault of something other than the cord; if i find anything, i'll update my review."
2,Maybe spring for something less cheap?,"I initially really liked this cable because it was so inexpensive and worked just fine with any TV I connected my laptop to. However, the first cable that I bought worked for a month or two and then my screen would randomly start turning blue, then yellow, then red until the cable stopped working completely.Thinking it was just that one cable, I figured since it was so inexpensive, I'd just replace it with another. The second one that I bought has been working fine for almost 5 months, but is now almost completely unusable and broke down much faster than the first one.Bottom line is I'd much rather just buy a more expensive cable that won't stop working in a matter of months than have to replace one of these every few months."
2,Cheap cable!!!,Do not buy if you want resolution higher than 1600 x 1200.. It does not support higher resolution. I ended up buying cable that cost me arounf $10.
5,Great,"I use this to plug my laptop or desktop up to my 46"" tv and use it for a computer monitor. Really awesome for movies and some PC games."
5,"Great, cheap cable","This cable worked great on a pc-to lcd tv setup. Length was sufficient, and a great price. Shipped quick. No complaints!"
2,"Fuzzy Image Projection, Shipped broken.","The Vga cable was, 10ft, and did connect to my computer. It also made it to my house on the last day of the delivery estimate. However the cord was cracked at the protection block just down from the plug. It projected a dull, fuzzy image, with all text looking smeared to the right. Whites were also dull grey, instead of white.Hopefully Importer520 resolves my issue with a new product."
2,Failed after 4 months of light use,"I had this cord for barely 4 months when it began failing on me, dropping colors at first, then completely failed to transduce video signal. While it worked, video quality was excellent, but I would not recommend this type of cable. Try a more reliable brand."
2,Poor Quality for a good price,"The video quality of the cable is very low. There is a definite difference in resolution between a good quality cable, and this one. The picture is fuzzy and cannot be fixed. For the price its a good deal if you can deal with the fuzziness!"
2,Warning to buyers,"This cable is not to be used if you plan to use the screen alot,I have a intense blur and its not to fun looking at day in and day out.if you just need this to test stuff or temp builds then yea this could be nice.PS. you get what you pay for!"
1,,I ordered a 12 foot cable and I received a 10 foot cable instead. I am very disappointed with this order.
4,Hi Res monitor cable,this item works pretty well. I use it tom connect my computer to a projector. For these purposes i couldn't ask for much more.
1,don't buy.,"bought 2 of them. both of them can't handle high resolutions, and is no where near hd. blurry picture. and apparently i need 20 words for this review. - this product sucks. do not waste your money on it. don't buy/"
3,It works,"It works.. that's all I can say I guess. I used this to hook up my computer to my 32"" HDTV which has VGA. on the factory 6' cable the computer automatically detects the TV's Resolution... But this one does not. so I have to set it up everytime. 3 stars only for the fact that it shows a picture.."
1,Didn't work,"Bought this cable to hook up my laptop to a flatscreen TV, but this cable does not work. The 4 ft cable from my desktop works just fine, but not this one. On top of that, when I tested this cable with the desktop and screen the image was blurry. This cable is a POS."
2,Not bad when it works,"I wanted to transfer the image from my laptop to my 42 inch flatscreen and this did the job nicely......a few times and now it doesn't. That's that. Bought mine from Importer520 for only a buck eighty-nine. At $3 to ship it back I'd be out $6. More than twice what I paid for the cable. That's the major downside with buying stuff online, S/H charges. Now I have ten feet of useless cable =/"
1,HORRIBLE CABLE,"I bought this cable as an alternative to the $26 Dynex cable I purchased from BEST BUY. When it arrived, I unplugged the Dynex and plugged in this one. I instantly noticed a change in quality.This cable has THE WORST video quality I'VE EVER SEEN!!!! The color was faded, the picture quality was very low. This cable is just horrible!!!"
1,doesnt work on a samsung ln40,"really wish i read some reviews before i made this purchase. nice cable, and length. my tv just doesnt recognize the cable."
3,Doesn't work for Samsung LN40A650 LCD TV,"I bought this to connect a laptop to my Samsung LN40A650 LCD TV, but the Samsung does not like the way the pins are wired in this cable. It is definitely the cable, because after trying 2 other laptops without success, I used another VGA cable that was previously on a desktop PC system. That one did the trick. With the 10ft cable I bought, the TV didn't recognize the PC input was connected. The VGA cable from the desktop PC worked, though I can only get up to 1300x768 resolution, not up to 1920x1080.This 10ft cable still works, because it is now being used for the desktop PC instead. Just don't expect it to work with LN40A650. You may be taking a risk with any Samsung TV from 2008/9.I also searched online about this problem, and it is a common. Apparently not all VGA cables are made the same way. This one just isn't made the way Samsung needs it to be. It will probably work with most other devices."
