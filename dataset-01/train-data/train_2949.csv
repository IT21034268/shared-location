3,The Great White Buffalo is Missing !!!,"It's hard to call this the ""Ultimate"" anything without that classic tune and rock radio staple, Great White Buffalo. A glaring omission from an otherwise stellar ""best of""."
5,the ultimate collection from the wild man of Detroit,"the ultimate collection from ted nugent is easily the best compilation from this great guitarist from detroit.it contains all his great hits from the 70's likestrangelhold,stormtroopin,snakeskin cowboys,just what the doctor ordered,free for all,hammerdown,paralyzed,take it or leave it,wango tango.ted's guitar smokes in each and every song in this brlliant compilation which contains some of the best hard rock music ever.the best part of this superb compilation is the excellent remastering which leaves this cd much better than his other compilation out of control.very highly recommended."
4,Good but not Great,"As a kid growing up in Detroit during the 70's who wasn't into drugs - Ted was my guitar hero. This is a pretty good collection for someone who doesn't already have a collection of the Nug's albums, but I can't help but ask; ""What about The Great White Buffalo?"" There is also no material from his Amboy Dukes days. It's kind'a hard to be a complete Ted Nugent collection without ""Journey to the Center of the Mind."" But this song will probably never appear on any Ted Nugent collection on which he has any say because he hates the words to this song."
2,Marvels - Marvelous!,"I bought this books years ago at an estate sale of a anthro. prof. at a local college. Estate and garage sales are a fantastic source of cheap books.I agree with the criticism of the Eurocentric attitudes, but hey Bernal Diaz had even harsher attitudes in his Conquest of New Spain - and that book is still worth reading.I often recommend this book to friends . If I had only been aware that it was out of print I would have held on to it.Time to look for another copy..........."
3,"OK, NOT GREAT",Cranky fell off his stand within a day. We superglued it back together and he seems to be sturdy for now.
1,Not as expected,This puller would not work on a 2004 F250 4X4 because the front differential housing is in the way of attaching any kind of air wrench to the puller. The pitman sits at an angle back and the puller has no room because of that angle. You can put a socket on it and tighten the puller but there is no room to tap the puller once it is tight. Don't waste you money unless you plan on removing the steering box also.
5,A Classic,"As I always say, you aren't considered a true gamer until you've tried Starcraft, HL1, and Doom. This game, a decade after release, is still being played by millions of people. The community is still triving and there are still tournements.Buy it. It'll be $20 that go a very, VERY long way."
4,Starcraft: the most awesome game!,"This is a completely awesome game. For players that have starcraft, this completely expands. 6 or 7 new units are featured with starcraft brood war. This pack also comes with 2 strategy guides that are extremely helpful in almost all the levels. There are many new cheats for those cheaters out there. I only gave this game four stars because it is so muych like warcraft II. It is played in almost the exact same way."
5,Holy COW,"Man, I can not get enough of these games. The RTS (Real-Time Stratagy) line of games is nothing compared to Starcraft and Starcraft: Brood War. You really have to think to be able to beat this. The computer sets traps, comes at you from every different angles, builds the right units at the right time. It's so great. And to top it all off, go on Battle.net and find some very interesting custom maps. I have quite a good archive and some of these map creators are AWESOME. The abilities you have in customizing these levels are astounding, and left up to the imagination. To put it short: Brilliant use of Computer AI, excellent creation schemes and objects, cool enemies and races, FUN GAME."
5,starcraft / brood warz = the BEST PC game,i have played brood wars for the past 3 years everyday for atleast 10 hours per night and after playing it soo much i decided it was the BEST game ever!! there is no other game that can compare! other games like counterstrike has no chance over starcraft!!
4,The Best Strategy Game ever!,"I have been playing this game for over 3 years and it still is not boring. Battle.net (multiplayer) is so much fun and their are so many different types of games. Starcraft has so many strategies and uses of its units that I am still learning today! This is a must buy, trust me you will not regret it."
4,Good old-fashioned shoot-em-up fun,"After being disappointed with several of the newer games out (Mideival Total War 2, Neverwinter Nights 2), I re-purchased an old favorite. It's not fancy and the graphics are nothing special, but Starcraft is a solid, fun game. The AI is limited but sometimes I like to set it to ""melee"" (everyone against me) and see how many computer-players I can fend off. If you're looking for unsophisticated shoot-em-up fun, nothing's better than Starcraft for the price."
1,Don't bother if you have a widescreen monitor or laptop.,"I'm not saying Starcraft is a bad game- but Blizzard has repackaged and resold this title to run on new PC's, but they fail to tell you that game only runs on a small resolution that cannot be changed, and that there is no way to run it in a window mode without using hacks that will not work with the ""new"" version of the game. This means that if you use a widescreen monitor or a laptop, the graphics are distorted and nasty looking, to a point where I couldn't play it. Shame on blizzard for not adding windowed mode in the latest patches- people have been trying to hack in this feature for years and the request seems to fall on deaf ears. If they don't support the game, they should stop selling it too."
3,starcraft,"man this game is awesome! play missions, kill the computer, or go on battle dot net and play aginst other players! be protoss(advanced aliens), zerg(harsh aliens), or terran(what you are human)!get new maps and kill the people! my last tip,GET THE BATTLECHEST! i give it 5 stars"
3,Fun but a bit outdated.,"This game is extremely long, challenging, and fun... but its a bit old.The graphics and animation are just plain old ugly.The 3 races in the game are well balanced and pretty interesting though.This game might have been great 4 years ago but for now Warcraft 3, also made by Blizzard, is the far superior game."
5,Amazingly fun RTS game that a FPS fan can enjoy,"I was never big into RTS games, my friend let me borrow C&C, I thought it was interesting but it didn't really sell me. I bought this out of all the hype and after enjoying C&C, it blew my mine, this game is old in my book,but the textures and graphics still hold up. The box is a bit overkill, I just want the disc and the code I could care less about the strategy guide and free WoW passes."
2,Classic or Geriatric?,"Just like Indiana Jones or Star Trek, this game is either a classic and undeniably awesome or a really old game and pretty lame. It's averaging 4.8 stars on the reviews, but from people that have played it since it was the cutting edge of RTS games. I started playing it well after playing games like Age of Empires 2 and 3, Age of Mythology, and Empire Earth. The feel of the game just falls short in my opinion. The graphics aren't impressive and it doesn't have the fascination of human history in it. That being said, I understand why people like it, but if you're reading reviews because you've never played it before, it's probably not your cup of tea."
5,Awesome game,"I've played pretty much all the games Blizzard made except this one. I bought this a month ago and it is awesome. Even though the graphics are from 1998, they're not bad. Great story and great campaign missions. I wish current RTS games would stick with great linear campaigns like this game did (read: the Dawn of War expansions)."
5,Well Starcraft is the best game ever made.....,"And the Battle Chest is even better. You can get both Starcraft, and Starcraft: Broodwar just about the two best games ever made, and both stratigy guides for a mere [dollar amount], I highly recommend this product."
5,starcraft,"this is such a good game i play for hours everyday its to fun to stop playing. i love blizard entertainment. all of the species are fun to play Zerg,terran, and protoss"
5,Great Game!,"This is a fantastic game, I have never played a RTS game before this and I was hooked instantly, gameplay is smooth with no choppiness whatsoever and it can be very challenging. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
5,StarCraft Battle Chest,"I got StarCraft Battle Chest as a present for my husband and he loved it and was immediately ""hooked"". This was one of the first video games he's gotten and by reading the reviews on Amazon, it seemed like a great choice - it was."
2,Good game with some key problems.,"This game would be good, but there are some prooblems with it, for exhample, you can ony select unets unets at a time, which is really annoying when you want to attack with more then nine. It also has tanks that are un-realistic and look cheep, which take away from the fun. My recomendation is to buy:Red alert 2 or earth 2150."
2,Red Alert 2 is much more fun to play,"Starcraft is a good game, but red alert and red alert 2 are much better. I have red alert on my old machine and i tried to put starcraft on it but it is so bad it lags offline and in missions. I wouldn't spend my money on it, so if you really want it get someone to burn it for you because virtuallly every teen has it. getting it burned isn' teven hard, as there are cd key generators online that will allow you to play on bnet. the graphics are a bit better than red alert, but the gameplay is the real difference. westwood games are just more fun."
5,sheer pleasure,this is the fourth time i have bought this product...between my grandson and three other computers...i have been playing this game since it came out..i am waiting for the new starcraft 2 to come out..and it looks like it's going to be better... but this one i have enjoyed for many year along with other players online for along time...
5,Good old StarCraft,"One can't go wrong with StarCraft. It has dated graphics by today's standards, but I can boot it up today and still be amazed at its clean-cut, mysteriously cool feeling. A simple RTS and with few units compared with today's 8- gigabyte monsters *cough-SupCom-cough*, but a game nonetheless which I have never tired of. Even as a gamer who plays all the new, big name RTS's, RPG's, and FPS's, I still say that this game is among my favorite of all time.[...]"
5,Best RTS Game,"Since my machine is not up to StarCraft II's specs, I thought I'd try the original to see how it works until I can upgrade my system. I am very glad I did, as StarCraft is an excellent and very addictive game.As with all earlier Blizzard games, StarCraft is a game of constant action, and it requires even more attention than most other RTS games. The 3 races are evenly balanced and diverse enough to ensure unlimited enjoyment and gameplay, as is Blizzards method for success.One must keep his eyes on all sectors of the map at all times, lest he allow anything to remain idle, or the let the enemy slip in behind his lines. With such intense action required, this game is easy to learn yet nigh impossible to master.The only complaint I have is the game is so durn addictive that I have spent entire days off playing the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys video games, as the price is easy to handle, and the game is impeccable."
4,Great Game,"StarCraft was originally acclaimed as ""WarCraft in space"". Not so. StarCraft offers its own individual flavor, and is very much necessary for understanding most of its sequel's plot. Still, multiplayer can be extremely lag filled, especially over slow school wifi. [...] can also be annoying at times, with bugs, glitches and adverts, but that is to be expected of any over-the-net play. Overall, StarCraft is not to be dwarfed by its older brother."
5,But it,"This game is great. There's no question. If you have any dought, just look at these posts. When I wrote this, there were 158 posts, the latest being in Feb. 2002. This game was realeased in 1998, and thousands of people are still playing it everyday. The game can not get old, with the campaign editor, the limit really is your imagination. Like anything online, you have to watch out for certain people, but if your careful its extremely obvious which games you should avoid. If you ever do get bored (highly un-likely) of this game, you can join a ""clan"", kind of like a club or online community for Starcraft players to liven things up. There is a downside...I actually had to sell my copy of Starcraft because I played it so much, this game is ADDICTING. Put a limit on yourself or you will find yourself playing way too often. Buy this Battlechest because you need the ex-pansion pack anyways and get in on a great game."
5,If you're a nerd.,"Starcraft has to be the best computer game I've ever played... and believe me, I've played them all. Diablo, Diablo 2, Red Alert, command and conquer, unreal tournament, thief, dungeon keeper, sims... Starcraft and Broodwar is better than all of these games rolled into one... u can play for 10 minutes or for 4 hours... it can be addictive at times... but its amazing!"
5,Awesome,Best game ever if you play on battle net get ready for people who lag alot the two strategy guides are pretty bad on multiplayer but good for single player the first starcraft is good but the brood war is a lot better you get a lot of new guys and maps good storline look for me on battle net 3.16rattlesnake
5,Superb Ending to A Superb Story,"I want Raynor to either kill Kerrigan or save her, but the only disappointing thing about the continuation of this story is that this question is not answered. Other than that... the game is perfect."
5,Starcraft best ever!,"Absolutley best game ever! I am currently playing Starcraft 2 but hey cmon who does not like the orginals!:) This game has everything, horror, action, drama, amd adventure! You will actually need to use your brain unlike other video games!:)"
4,"Starcraft, honest evaluation from a avid strategy gamer","Starcraft is excellent. Brood War is better, put them together and they are dynamite! Really Starcraft is getting a tad old now, but its a brilliant game even now, it may be out of fashion, but it is really good. With the strategy guides you can get online and play SC or BW right away with confidence, you may even beat me (I have a recond of 214 wins to 7 losses :-) Annyway, if you want a very good RTS game, buy this, you won't be dissapointed, the best thing about this is that with both packs, the story blends seamlessly, and the guides get newbies fighting with competence in no time. The only downsides are that the game is a bit old (but still a classic), and that there are not huge numbers of units, for instance in TA (another game I warmly reccomend), but its simple, its beautiful, and if you avoid money maps, a really excellent way to invest your gamer cash. Just don't play me on battle.net until you have won a few ladder matches. Abyss"
5,This game never gets old!,"Since it came out have been playing and between online or lan connected it is great. Adding levels or build your own, it's a great game."
5,STARCRAFT >>> BEST GAME SO FAR !!,"Starcraft honestly has to be the best game ever played so far ! With multiple levels of pure action and strategy it gets a 5 star rating for sure!! .. The best included feature of the game is the multiplayer support through Battle.net , Just load up the game > click multiplayer > B.NET and your in and ready to play in just seconds!! (which by the way is included for FREE when you purchase the game) , WHAT A DEAL! And here is somthing else that makes it sound just that much better , Purchase ""BROOD WAR"" and add many more deadly characters and levels to your single / multiplayer game (Brood War is awesome)! YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE TRUST ME"
3,Great games - don't work well on new machines,"I loved these games and was excited to play them again after having sold mine previously at a yard sale. The game however had problems saving games on the newer machines and you would have to complete missions in one setting, which is quite a spell for some of them. I also had to be a little creative to get to the higher level missions since it did not want to register if I completed one. It was great, but if these problems cannot be fixed, it is not worth the hassle."
4,Swiss Time Keeping as Mack Truck,"This watch is solid. Dead reliable. Feels as if it were made from a solid ingot of stainless steel. Bracelet and clasp are far more sturdy than bands on my Rolex and Movado timepieces. Just a workhorse of a watch. Really suprised at how much these things have gone up in price though. Oh well I got my first Tag Heur for 300 bucks... it just goes to show you, as things get popular they get more expensive."
2,Cushion Grip Denture Adhesive,"Difficult to use, Hard to remove, Good Cushion, Not much grip.Has to be very warm to spread in plate, also you want to warm up the plate before you try to apply the product, Soak in hot water, then dry plate, apply product. Product will take cleaning and brushing with out coming off.To remove from plate, soak in hot water and then pick it off, takes a little work to get it all off. I found I still had to use other adhesive to keep my bottom plate in place."
4,Better than the other stuff!!!,"If I have to use anything, this is the best. It lasts a long time and is not sticky or distasteful. I can wash my denture andit still stays put. They ship is fast and at no charge. I think it is a great option."
4,On line purchase.,"Since I have to use this product anyway, it's much cheaper and way more convenient to order it on line instead of at the local drug store."
1,Not what I expected,This stuff is not at all what I expected after reading all the good reviews before purchase. It was hard to work with and it became a complete and utter mess.Trying to remove it was a horror. I am glad I only purchased one Tube (which by the way went into the Trash Can)
1,Misleading Advertisement,"After waiting for a month for the product to arrive, I was very disappointed with the claims made by the Product.It is much worse than the normal denture adhesive I have been using.The product does not hold my lower partial denture at all, let alone holding it up to 4 days!Besides, the removal of the used product requires some effort on my part."
2,"I had high hopes, but nope!","This product made a comfortable cushion for my dentures, but it did not adhere well to my gums. The dentures rocked a little and on the third day when I bit on something firm my denture broke in two! This denture was nearly new! I think this product could possibly be useful if your dentures were way too big and you needed to fill in the gaps. Also, I think someone suggested adding fixodent on top of it so it will adhere to your gums better."
1,Cushion Grip,"This is the worst product I ever bought I followed the directions very carfully & it never worked, I thoughtwhen I bought Cushion Grip it would be A great denture adhesive, so i purchase four big mistake i tryed to get a refund but never did."
1,What a lemon of a product,I had high hopes for this one and it let me down. I think the positive feed backs are from the manufactor friends or something to make it sell. Do not waste your money on this one. The liner came out everythime I took the dentures out.
1,cushion grip,My husband is very pleased with our order of cushion grip. Amazon.com sent our order very quick and we are very pleased. We'll be ordering again in the future.
1,Holding in dentures,I purchased this product for my friend for a denture adhesive.I found it doesnt hold in the dentures. Its difficult to apply and not worth the money. I went back to fixadent.
1,SHAME TO AMAZON FOR SELLING THIS PRODUCT!,"I REPIT THE COMENT FROM BIG G OF SEPTEMBER 28,2011.WHY TO WASTE MORE TIME FOR THIS JUNK.THEY JUST E-MAIL ME REGARDING MY COMPLAIN SAYING NOBODY CLAIMED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND RECOMEND ME TO SEE A DENTIST OR MD (WHAT TIPE,MENTAL DOCTOR??)"
4,good alternative,"I have used this type of product before and have found it to be a good alternative to the expense of having dentures relined by Dentist. Even though directions say you should still go to Dentist as soon as possible and that this product is only a temporary solution, the last time I used it, it lasted 3 years. Being retired and on a fixed income, this helps a lot."
2,this stuff is worthless,I followed the directions exactly and this stuff would not stick. It is darn near impossible to remove from dentures once it is on.
1,Horrible,This stuff is horrible. It lasted all of 10 minutes and it peeled right off. Very disappointed and will not buy again or recommend.
2,One or 2 uses.,"The Cushion Grip worked great the first time I used it. Still worked the second time, but it becomes more difficult with each attempt because the product becomes firmer each time it is opened to the air. You are better off using a reline kit or just regular denture adhesive."
2,Cushion Grip,I bought it for my husband to replace Sea Bond. He wasn't happy with the product it all oozed out with in 24 hours.Will never buy it again.Sea bond was the best product on the market.
1,DON'T DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY !,"PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE, CANNOT GET IT REPLACED NOR A REFUND.DON'T DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE"
1,Yuck!,This was a complete waste of my money. I don't know who came up with this masochistic product. It tasted toxic. I'm talking straight chemicals and it was so gooey I couldn't even manage to get it out of my mouth in time to *not* taste it. It reminded me of that gooey chemical kids toy that you'd ball up and put on the end of a straw and blow iridescent bubbles with TIMES 100!! Don't bother *Note: I set aside in my bathroom drawer and a month later noticed that it had seeped out of its metal tube all over everything. Was its chemicals just it hing to escape? Scary.
1,product didn't work,"I bought this for my husband, he used it and said that it didn't hold his bottom denture in AT ALL and that only held his top denture in for a short time, maybe 8 hours. He followed the directions so that wasn't the problem."
5,Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive,Works great. I buy mine at Walgreens and they usually have it in stock. I have left it on my dentures for up to six weeks at a time before I have removed and reapplied it. I soak my dentures nightly and it does not effect the fit or cushion. Best product I have found for my comfort.
4,The best I've found,"The taste is a little annoying at first, and it doesn't really have any grip, but the cushion is the reason I keep buying Cushion Grip. Having a little between the hard plastic and my gums makes a world of difference in comfort. And it lasts for days, sometimes weeks. I've used it for years."
2,Not the Best,"This book is only okay. It does have some good ideas but if you are already in the business, or are currently in a theatre program, you probably already know most of what's in this book. It also seems to advocate a larger portfolio but in my experience it seems that smaller and more portable will prove to be more useful. If you are starting from scratch it's worth a quick read but I would borrow it as yoou will probably out grow the advice quickly."
1,"If you want to help the Qero, don't buy this book","I couldn't agree with the previous reviewer more. Although I've never been to Peru, I've been exploring Native healing practices for over 10 years, in several other countries. I've cooresponded by email with the author, and stopped when she accused me of taking a position I never took about healing practices, and refused to provide evidence that I had done so. This book romanticizes the Qero, and her role in telling their story. Conversations I've had with a Peruvian curandero who has studied with the Qero confirm that she has made errors in her book. Given her lack of both Spanish and Quechua, and all the above, she is clearly not interested in accuracy."
1,actual brush use,"This latest version of brushes have brissels that are just to soft and the wire bends to easy !The older version that I have used had stiffer brissels and must have had better cleaning capability , which I personnaly prefer .I am sorry I purchased a quantity ."
1,Wrong product,"What i received was not what I ordered. Instead of the standard brush refills, which I have used for several years, i received ""fine"" brushes, which may work for some people , but not for me."
3,interdental brush refills,These are not the same quality as the Oral-B that I last purchased at the retail stores. They are difficult to find so evidently this may be the only type left to buy. The brush part of the cylinder is quite small and won't last as long as the older ones.
1,Wrong Product Shipped !!,"DO NOT BUY !! These were supposed to be the Oral-B refills, but instead I was shipped the GUM refills that require a long, different handle. The GUM brushes are not as dense as the Oral-B ones. Absolutely false advertisement!"
1,Made for babies,"These interdental brushes are not the same ones you can buy at any drugstore. They are very small and I believe intended for children, but the description online does not indicate that. They are very small and wear out quite quickly."
2,Product not correctly described therefore ineffective,"The tapered interdental refills I was sent were much thinner than what I had been using and were of little use. On the package it says ""fine"" but the product description given by [...] did not indicate that they were not the regular size. I tried to twist two together but couldn't make them stay together."
2,PNY P-EFD512U20K-RF Executive Attache' Flash Drive,"For such an appealing look and style, it is a pity that this item is not more durable. The flash drive storage component came apart/separated when removing it from the USB port after just three weeks of use. I was really disappointed."
2,"Good idea, poor implementation","Unfortunately, the great idea here to combine pen and pen drive lacks, as a previous reviewer said, durability. My flash housing separated from the body of the pen and the actual pen portion stopped working months ago.. all in all a bit of a dissapointment"
3,textbook requirement,I had to buy this book for a class I was taking. Gave me insights on the DOC history so it helped me get through the course
3,Kingdom,"Reasonably well done production about a village solicitor and the antics he, his family and staff get into. Set in a marvelous seaside village which serves as a backdrop for the series. Average dialog and acting. More like, but not as good as Doc Martin. Not in the same class as Mapp and Lucia or All Creatures, though. An Easy going series making it easy to watch and easy to take."
5,Stephen Fry at his best,"""Kingdom Season One"" Is a tour of the wonderful, creative and charming actor Stephen Fry at his best. Set in a mid size contemporary English town, Stephen is the local solicitor (Lawyer) who takes on a fresh up start (I'm smarter than you) junior partner and proceeds to have us come aboard his classic 1965 Alvis TE21 Drophead Coupe and follow his adventures as he assists business owners, wives, shop keepers and a few occasional loonies in town. The writers must have had Stephen in mind for this series, it lets him display his unique charm, and whimsical wit. After viewing the first DVD I immediately ordered Season Two and Three and sit by my computer in hopes of season four."
5,Television 2.0?,"In Television Disrupted, Shelly Palmer does a great job at presenting the probable futures of TV. From broadcast to narrowcast, from linear to dynamic and time-shifted,from analog to digital, Shelly explores and tries to anticipate the response of ""old media"" (networks) to ""new media"" (networked). How will ""IP"" and user generated content overcome inertia and established advertising / revenue models? All fascinating questions in a well thought-out framework. In the end and as always consumers will choose and define what is to become a much richer experience known as Television 2.0!"
5,What's not to like?,"His first book, ZEN MIND BEGINNERS MIND, one of my first 30 years ago, I have read once every other year, and always find other things to guide me. It is one I give to beginning students; and it is often ""stolen"" and I just get another one. One of the best Buddhist teachers -- and this book is absolutely wonderful."
4,Prequel better than Sequel,"Although I could not fail to enjoy anything collected from the speeches and writings of Suzuki, this book was not as meaningful to me as the first book for which it is the sequel, Zen Mind, Beautiful Mind. It repeats itself more, but there is still much to be learned from it. It seems to contain more of Suzuki's humor than the first book, and has a casual feel as it is taken from his in-person lectures."
5,Truth Is Often Simple,"I first read this book 10 years ago when I began sitting. Indeed the book encouraged me to just start. Fast forward 10 years later and it is still a powerful companion. I've read other books, listened to other talks, even ""hopped around"" from place to place as I continued ""seeking""....but no one gets to the heart of the matter the way Suzuki Roshi does. He is funny, gentle, direct, and compassionate. He makes it clear. And you can feel the spirit in it. In the book he talks about eventually sitting with great Zen masters. Sit with everything. Wow. It's not just talk. Master or student, get it and find out for yourself. It can change your life. It certainly changed mine...and continues to do so every moment."
5,Uncommonly brilliant,"Suzuki Roshi always presented himself, though a priest, as a simple, common man.Reading his words, one realizes he was anything but common. He had a way of condensing the seemingly complex matters of life and spirituality down into brilliantly concise, eye-opening statements.He presented hundreds of short talks during his time in California, of which this and other of 'his' books are condensations. Not all of his words and ideas hold you perfectly entranced, but the gems are hiding in there, and well worth the searching.If you are looking for a guide back to infinite being - Suzuki Roshi is one of the few in which you can have absolute trust and confidence."
2,i did not say i did not like it.i rated it two out of five,"it gives a few reminders about things and that is useful to all sitters but either the editor or Suzuki probablyhas not experienced the perfect emptiness of the universe, and so Suzuki would have done better to haveallowed his own experience to be just that"
3,It is OK,Not the masterpiece of Zen mind beginners mind but ok I still can't get myself to finish reading it.
3,3 shards short of full chickenbucket,"This one comes up 3 shards short of full chickenbucket.Wedges binge sort of bootsy styleSome slices are krispywhile other coop sounds are sort ofmachine man maskatron like,sort of like when your face gets ripped offor going 3 directions at one time"
2,"Hard to read, not what I expected.",This was so hard to read I didn't finish it. Was expecting more of a biography than a collection of letters.
5,Sentimental Christmas,This is a CD of nostalgic Christmas songs from the 1940s and 1950s. Each of the songs are sung by the artist who made it famous. It's wonderful hearing the tunes of your youth.
5,Undiscovered Treasure,"Beautiful short pieces, reminiscent of Chopin, wonderfully performed. I find myself continually returning to this CD."
2,Much better recording available than this,"What you want is ""Just Might Take Your Life"". That is the higher quality recording of the Cal Jam show. Forget this one. That one smokes !"
1,Not what it appears to be,Sounds crappy. Would rather buy all the studio releases and be content. I wanted to sell mine or trade it 15 minutes after I had it. There's better Richie B. out there if thats what your after. I play guitar and was looking for something scorching but this was not it. Spend your cash on something else.
4,It's About Time!,"This book has most of the important facts about Godfrey's unique career. What a fascinating, if sometimes difficult, man. We who remember his shows, or who knew him (like myself, at age 18-19), have been waiting for years for this book. Mr. Singer could have dwelled on the scandals and tantrums and what not, but he chose to describe the broadcasting era and the man intelligently and fairly. Perhaps he could have expanded a little on some of the good things Godfrey did for many. It would have been nice to read the eventual fates of the various Little Godfreys. But Singer cleared up the false and terrible ""antisemitisim"" charges with common sense. No doubt Mr. Singer has enough good stuff left over for another volume on this important radio/TV/aviation pioneer!"
3,Future software upgrades will make this a great DVR,"This is a good DVR. Recorded images are very good even in low quality mode if you use a good camera. Time lapse is also good but rather limited in options. The computer interface works and allows you to download images to your computer. The problem with this unit is that the software really needs a lot of work to enhance navigation, features and reliablity. Owners manual did not match the software either. If your the only one using this (no employee's etc) then this might work if your computer literate. If your looking for something you can set and forget this will work--power loss doesn't effect configurations. You just got to be tolerant of the lack of features and buggy software before you get it configured the way you want. Software version I used was June 2006 or earlier."
3,Does the job. You need to teach the kids to be careful though......,This toy is a nice idea for kids who could have trouble with card games as the number of cards to be held increase. It is not completely intuitive and you have to teach the kids to slide the cards in a certain way and make sure that they do not mess up the two thin pieces of sponge/foam inside that act as the holder. You basically pinch the two discs on one end and that creates an opening for you to slide the cards in at the other end. The foam makes sure that the cards stay. My son uses it all the time when we play card games.
5,Great for when you have a lot of cards in your hand,"We play a lot of progressive rummy in my family, and when you get to the end of the game, having half a deck of cards in your hand is not uncommon. So many cards can be difficult to manage and has lead to many hand cramps. These holders are an excellent solution. They seem to be made out of fairly sturdy plastic. They also don't work like some of the other card holders I have used before. They use a spring that you push on in the middle to separate the holder to insert cards, meaning the two discs of the holder cannot be spun opposite of each other unless you want to break the holder. Not a big deal, just something different."
1,Disappointing,"2 broke the 1st day they were used. They just were not sturdy enough. Good idea, however, they need to be revamped a bit."
1,Cheaply made,"I purchased these for my friends and was very disappointed when the foam in the middle crunched up, making them useless. I guess you get what you pay for, but I sure wouldn't buy from this seller."
2,Lots of hiss,"Several years ago I bought a used CD of Mengelberg conducting one or maybe two of Beethoven's symphonies -- I forget which ones. The performance was great, but the hiss was too loud for me so I gave it away.Recently I decided to take a chance on this CD of Mengelberg doing Beethoven 6 & 8. The hiss on this CD is louder than I had hoped. I think I could have put up with it if I liked the performances as much as the ones on the other CD, but I didn't like the first two movements of 6 and the last two movements of 8. Some of that was probably because of the recording and/or the transfer, some might have been because of a bad note played here or there, and at least some was because of Mengelberg's interpretation. Too bad, because I liked the other movements. You might like all the movements, but don't buy this CD if you have a low tolerance for hiss."
5,billiant as calorie-free chocolate,"Melissa and Doug's line of wooden ""paper"" dolls are a stroke of genius. Gone are the frustrating days of ripped tabs and splinting creased cardboard dolls with tape and popsicle sticks. Instead, M&D bring us durable wooden doll forms with magnetically-backed wooden clothing and accessories that not only hold up to dressing and undressing, but also to reasonable creative doll play. I have this particular set at home and have seen several others in daycare centers and the homes of children I sit for. So long as you don't try to scrub down the fronts (picture side) of the various pieces with water, the images will last for a long, long time. The included wooden storage case makes keeping the pieces together quite simple, even during bedtime clean-up. This is one toy that has been brilliantly conceived and executed. Thanks, Melissa and Doug!"
4,magnetic paper doll,This was a great buy. My 4 year old daughter loved it. I got it for her 4th birthday. Only complaint is the doll doesn't stand up too well in the little wooden case. Other than that it's a hit.
2,"cute toy, but needs a better lid","My 3 year old daughter loves playing with this toy. It could use a few improvements though.- It would be nice if the doll were magnetic too so she could play with all the pieces on the fridge- The stand does not hold the doll upright, she falls out- The ""storage box"" should come with a lid that stays on the boxWe spend a lot of time looking for missing pieces due to the lack of a lid."
3,"Excellent start, so-so finish","The book starts off with the Parliament of the World Religions' Declaration Toward a Global Ethic, a very interesting statement, as it shows the common threads and ideals of the world's major religions. Most of the rest of the book though consists of numerous spokespeople from positions of political power or religious importance seconding the statement. After a while, it gets a tad repititious as one leader after another says, in effect, ""This is a good idea whose time has come."" While they may be correct, it does not make for thrilling reading."
3,Good ToTrue Christians,"Noonday Flower was an adventuous book that took you through the trials and tribulations of discrimination. It had very discriptive words that made you feel like you were right in their shoes. The only thing that I wasn't enthusiastic about was the fact that you could definitely tell that the author was a true Christian. I am not one myself, but I am sure that a Christian would really enjoy this book becuase it gives you the feeling that God was there to make the young girls life a better place. It may be true in someone else's eyes, but not my own. Overall, this book was something that really gave me a new perspective over racism and over my native area of Michigan."
1,Defective Coffeemakers,"I purchased this item because of the good inital reviews however, I have just received my replacement coffeemaker and it has the same problem as the first one I received.Look at the picture of the Coffeemaker. Do you see the metal plate that covers the buttons? That plate slides down and makes the buttons stick. You are unable to turn the coffeemaker on/off, press the up/down & timer buttons because of it.Additionally, the original coffeemaker failed to make coffee as programmed about every other time it was set?I would steer clear of this item. It's great when you can get it to work but because of the obvious engineering defects (see other reviews with the same problem)it is more of a hassle than it's worth; especially at the current price.I guess all the time and effort into getting a coffeemaker to tell the weather made the designers forget about basic functionality!"
1,Don't buy this item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The coffee pot came with the down and timer buttons stucked together. Sent it back and received replacement quickly. It was great when it worked, after the 3rd day it didn't come on as programed and the down button got stuck again. The weather display was neat, too bad it didn't work out. I think there is a design fault on the machine. But I have to say Amazon has great customer service, we received our replacement very fast."
1,Spotty Performance,"This review concurs with many reviews that the electronic functions of this coffee maker has fundamental flaws. The major flaw with this coffee maker is that it does not hold the settings if it loses the FM data signal. If the signal is lost the pot does not know what time it is and will not automatically brew coffee using the timer. We live in an area that has the FM radio signal, but the pot constantly loses the signal resetting the pot. I have been unsuccessful in making a pot of coffee using the timer mode.Overall the weather functions are interesting, the pot makes a good cup of coffee, but I want a pot that makes the coffee automatically in the morning. I have returned this coffee maker for one with a simple timer."
1,Buy something else,"This is my second Melitta Grind & Brew. I purchased the last one several years ago and it broke within 3 months. I thought I would give them a second try, but the results are the same. As others have said, the buttons get stuck, the timer gets canceled if the machine loses its FM signal, and the warmer shuts off after only 1 hour. Buy something else."
1,Caution before you purchase!,The eye catching feature that provides a weather report is only available in 100 cities throughout the United States. The company (Orange Onions)Melitta ME1MSB Smart Mill & Brew 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemakeris virtually non=responsive for a return - we returned the coffee maker two months ago and have heard nothing from them nor have we received a refund. Amazon should not be offering products from dishonest vendors.
2,Worked OK for a while.,"Made OK coffee, but broke after less than a year. This is particularly concerning given that we only us it once or twice a week. Also, this is the second time we have had problems with Melitta coffee maker in less than a year. In both cases, the grinding mechanism just quit working. That's what you get with cheap plastic parts. The communication function is pretty useless, other than setting the time."
1,Didn't work long enough to get money's worth!,I had the Melitta one and a half years when the heating mechanism stopped working which meant it didn't brew coffee. I called customer service and they said they wouldn't do anything about it since it was over one year. I paid $200 for it and feel it is unacceptable for it to only have worked for that amount of time and that customer service wouldn't reimburse me for any of the amount. What a waste of money.
1,Don't buy this product,"Do not buy this product unless you are sure that the FM signal required to set the clock is available in your area. This signal is different than that for weather radio or an atomic clock. Without a signal, the machine cannot be programmed.Also, do not buy anything from Orangesandonions. They have a Five!! day return policy!!! So if a product arrives during the week, as mine did, and you find out on the weekend that you don't get a signal but have to wait until Monday to confirm it with Salton (the manufacturer) then you are out of luck.This may be the shortest return policy of any mail order business I have ever dealt with.Also, these units are being discounted everywhere including Tuesday Morning."
2,Screen filter makes weak coffee,I bought one of these because I thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee. The beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber. This works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink.The problem I had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee. Adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it wasn't as full-flavored as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker.I ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder. If you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you'll probably end up doing the same.
5,Great Christmas Gift,"I gave this coffemaker to my fiance as a Christmas gift, and both of us have been happy ever since. Initially I thought we wouldn't use the weather function, but it has become very useful during our hectic mornings before work. My fiance also takes her coffee very seriously and has been impressed with the quality of the coffee from day one. We have recommended the Mill & Brew to all of our friends that make coffee in the morning."
3,Sometimes good is good enough,"I have owned several Melitta Mill and Brew coffee makers since its introduction and think it is the best coffee maker around. Most recently this Smart Mill and Brew is the only one available and I have to tell you, the older version was better. It took up less space on the counter, for one thing. The weather part of this machine worked for 48 hours only before it ""died"". I have not had any of the other issues mentioned about the stainless steel plate slipping, and of course, it makes excellent coffee. But please, bring back my old Mill and Brew - it doesn't have to be Smart!"
2,Warning - Terrible Service,I own the previous model of this same coffee maker. I enjoyed the coffee it made except for the fact that the filter allows some small grounds to make it to the pot.After a few months we dropped the carafe and broke it. Guess what? Melitta didn't have any more replacements. It's been almost a year and I haven't received a replacement carafe still (not because I haven't been trying).I had to buy a more reputable brand coffee maker to replace this one. Think twice before buying this brand or else buy some spare parts immediately!
4,Very cool,"This is the second one that i had. This one, the latest model, comes with an atomic clock and msn.com weather. the good thing about this is that every time there is a brown out, the clock resets itself so the automatic brew in the morning does not have to be reset. You have to be careful with the 1 cent little locking piece of plastic and the coffee filtering device. Other than that it works like a charm."
5,Melita ME1MSB Smart Mill&Brew 10 cup Coffeemaker,"I have had many expensive Grind/Brew coffee makers that were leaky, complicated, messy and a chore to clean (Qusinart). The Melita is by far the superior of the others plus ease of use."
2,A Turn Off?,I purchased this coffeemaker because I had the original grind and brew from Melitta. My only complaint was the pot has an auto shutoff of one hour. You cannot turn the pot back on unless you make a fresh pot and there is water in the machine. Too big of a drawback for me since our family gets up at different times in the morning.
1,Will not do timer brewing if FM signal is not strong,"As others have said, you MUST have a STRONG FM signal or youwill only be able do manual brewing. Makes good coffee butcleaning the reusable filter is more of a pain than throwingaway a paper one."
2,Defective,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a defective coffee maker, since the metal plate surrounding the control buttons does not leave enough clearance around the buttons, and therefore they stick. I went to the store and checked out the display model, and its buttons were stuck also!The machine also makes weak coffee, since you need to use much more coffee beans than recommended to get a decent tasting cup of coffee. The grinder does not have the capacity needed to hold all of the beans required.Needs improvement regarding the above issues, but it's very pleasing aesthetically. It would also be good if it had a thermal carafe."
1,"good for 1 year, maybe...","The Melitta ME1MSB Smart Mill's grinder stopped working 11 months after it was purchased. Now, it only makes sock water. It is a complete waste of money to buy a coffee maker that grinds and brews. My next coffee machine will just MAKE coffee. I will leave the grinding to an actual separate grinder. The weather machine was a nice novelty for the first few weeks but after that, it became a pain to wait for it to ""boot up"" because I unplug my appliances."
4,Entertaining Coffeemaker,"I really like this coffee maker, and it is entertaining as well. Fresh ground coffee and the weather, what could be easier. The signal is lost quite a bit, but that may be because of where I live. This coffeemaker replaces another Melitta I used for 6 years, and is even easier to use. I love it!"
1,Disappointed!,"I just received my coffee maker..this would be my second Melita, and I thought the little things that went wrong w/the first were my fault (plastic lock breaking on top of the grinder, coffee continuing to drip when the carafe was removed, unable to set timer)but I plugged this one in and was able to set the auto brew...until i wanted to change the time and the ""timer"" and ""down"" buttons became stuck and I couldn't do anything but watch the clock display go round and round...and NO COFFEE! Not a ONE!!!i couldn't even turn the unit on! this is going right back!"
5,Happy to have found this!,I was so happy to have found this cd. It is one of my favorites but I had mistakenly given it away with some donations. It was shipped and arrived very promptly and was in excellent (new) condition.
3,Might not be for the long haul!,"I bought this cake pan for my daughter's birthday cake. The cake baked evenly and came out smoothly, but instructions included say the pan will break down eventually. It's not made of metal or silicone, but I thought a product I bought to make cakes with should be able to make cakes until I don't need it anymore! So far, I have seen no sign of wear on it, and I used it 4 times in one night (BIG party).I did not follow the instructions on how to make the horse's body (I believe it was something about candy???) but it still came out wonderfully being decorated with different frostings and tips. Would make a wonderful cake for that horse lover in all of us!"
1,Wrong Color Sent,I opened the package from thegolfstore.com and it was the wrong color. Maybe you should have the color in the picture match the description. I'm looking at the color in the picture (black with white writing) and received a purple and yellow one!!! Doesn't make sense- please read description very closely!
3,just buy if you want a good looking athletic bracelet,"My 13yo son read the hype on this and ordered it, has been wearing it continuously and it has held up fine, including in the water. However, it has not done anything medically as claimed. So buy this bracelet if you simply like the look of it."
1,Outdoorguys is a rip off company,"I purchased, and paid for the Trizon, waited 15 days, with no arrival, and told by Outdoorguys I would need to wait 30 days for arrival. Item never did arrive. Amazon did issue a credit after 30 days."
3,ok not what I expected,I love the colors but the braclet is not what I expected It is a little small and not working as well as other products that I have
3,Trion Z for the boyfriend,"My boyfriend was very curious for one of those sports balance bracelets. When I saw how much was the one he wanted, i did some research. The one he wanted had a sticker... i mean a hologram that helps you yada yada yada, then I did their test which is worse than a street magic trick... I found in amazon.com Trion Z. Decently priced and it sells the same idea as the other one. He loooved it... but it broke in less than 2 months... I found that weird becasue it is for sports... but maybe a less contact kind of sport (he plays football). SO one of my gifts for our anyverssary was the one I am reviewing right now... he is happy with it, hasnt broken and he actually says that it helps him (placebo effect or no, he is happy and I am happy>)"
2,Did not work for me,I bought it with an open mind hoping it would work. I wore it 24 for hours a day for 3 weeks and didn't notice any difference.
2,Didn' notice a difference,I never experienced any improvement with this product. I have used magnets before but I think the magetic properties of these are too low.
2,no result,no result sow far. i will buy just for design. also poor i buy white+ black.. . ... ... .. .. .. .. .
3,Stinky,I used this daily however if you exercise the band will stink. I soaked mine in vinegar and washed it with my workout clothes. Also small band is very small. I have very skinny wrists but it was still way too tight. Other than that I do feel a difference wearing a magnetic braclet. It really help tingling in my legs and balance with yoga.
2,Golf Voodoo,"Once a gain I find myself a victim of hype & a few dollars lighter. Got caught up in the advertising & athlete endorsements. Wore it for a while & stopped. All I can tell you is that medium is tight for the average adult male wrist so, if after reading this, you are compelled to purchase make sure you buy a large :)"
2,Looked Nice At First,"Item looked nice at first, but after a couple of days of use, the bands twisted out of shape so they looked terrible and would not go back into original shape and looks. Getting it wet in the shower made things even worse. I have no idea whether it did what it was supposed to since I don't believe in that stuff. It is way overpriced and I would not recommend it."
2,Trion-Z Wrist Bracelet,"I'm not quite sure what I was looking for, possibly a miracle. Had shoulder surgery and I was hoping it would have taken some of the pain away."
1,Product is a Scam,"This product is nothing but a scam. It is well-researched that ionic bands perform no better than a placebo. There are no benefits of negative ions, nor powerful magnets. It is definitely not worth the listed price.Save your money and strap a rubber band on your wrist instead. Like theOfficial Lance Armstrong Yellow Cancer LiveSTRONG Rubber Wristband Bracelet."
3,50/50,believe in it or not it looks kinda cool. This version is better and worse than the original in that it holds the bands together better but gets stinky after a while since it is covered in fabric rather than silicone which the original has.
2,"It is, what it is.","Curiosity got the best of me and I purchased this item. It has no effect on your health whatsoever in my opinion, but it's a cool little sports bracelet. No big deal."
5,"I don't get it, but it works...","I had painful ""tennis elbow"" in my right elbow from lots of computer/mouse work and some golf. It was so bad that I was wearing one of those compression straps around my forearm to support the muscle, and I went to an orthopedic who found nothing on an x-ray and exam. He prescribed routine exercises, which I have been too lazy to do.So I thought I'd try one of these and I don't understand i, but it works. Within a day or two, the pain is pretty much gone and I have made no other changes in my life and habits. I have since bought these for my wife and both parents (in their 70's), and all have reported some joint or back issue that is now gone.There is another product called a ""power band"" that my wife tried and it did nothing for her. It ""works"" by way of a hologram that supposedly does something. (I have 10 holograms in my wallet (i.e. credit cards with holograms) and they haven't ever made my elbow feel well)....I recommended this product!!"
4,"May not work for me, but I like the look of it.","First, I'd like to clarify the size issue that many of the other comments address. I have large wrists, but I am female. I ordered the large because of the comments about them being too small, but mine is loose on my wrist - not enough to fall off, but enough not to stay in one place. I think maybe a medium would work for a large-wristed female, but a large might be needed for a small-wristed male. On the topic of whether or not it works, my (very intelligent) friend swears by hers, so I thought I'd give it a try. I like the look of mine, even if it ends up not working for me."
5,Believe it or not!,"This is not hocus pocus snake oil...It really works. I had tendonitis in my right wrist for months. Then I started wearing the magnets on my wrist at night...pain gone, range of motion and strength back. Truly amazed me!"
2,Not Even Good As A Fashion Accesory,I had pretty low expectations when buying this - if it didn't work at least it looks half way decent and I could still wear it as a fashion accessory. Here's the problem - it's made from some sort of elastic/fabric that absorbs sweat. If you get it wet or sweat the thing starts to smell after awhile. If it was made out of silicone you wouldn't have this problem. The funny thing is I did feel a little better when I started wearing this - seemed more relaxed (probably a placebo effect) - but it's a moot point because I can't wear this thing due to the smell.
1,Q-Ray sued by the FTC for selling this,"In 2006, the FTC won its case against Q-Ray for selling Ionized / magnetic bracelets and claiming they healed people. The bracelets were proven to have no effect beyond the standard placebo effect (You could consider this the power of positive thinking).[...]Q-ray was guilty of deceiving and defrauding its customers, claiming a bracelet would heal their pain.Companies are required to find that pain relief claims of these type should be supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence consisting of at least one well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical study.This bracelet won't help you. It's just another company defrauding its customers. And it is almost certainly illegal."
2,Looks cool - Does not work,"I bought this item because I was sold on the benefits stated on the TrionZ website. Mind you, I am not an avid golfer however I would expect to experience the benefits on and off a golf course. Well needless to day I felt no difference. The website states that it may take a few days to experience any sort of benefit. Well, after a month I had felt no difference. I've been wearing it for a year now and the reason why I persist to wear this bracelet which does nothing for me is because the colors of the bracelet are of my alma mater, no other reason."
1,Small magnet,Disappointing ...I thought there would be more magnets on the braclet. Along with the braclet they should send a magnifying glass so you could find it.
2,"Eeh..so, so","I purchased this bracelet to try to relieve my chronic pain. If it lessened it any, the effect was slight. I didn't keep it on at night because it was tight. Maybe that would have changed my results. Since I don't do athletics, I can;t attest to the affect on performance. For the price, you might try it if you're desperate.ProsPrettyComfortableNot damaged by waterConstightdidn't work"
3,Question?,"Not sure I buy into this idea that a bracelet can give you better balance. The product is fine, not sure of the results?"
3,Hard to tell,"First off, I have small wrists, but the medium was so tight as to be uncomfortable. Second, I can't really tell any difference. Other than that it's great. Looks kinda cool."
3,WOLF IN SHEEPS CLOTHING,"Coogans work is one of the best on the IRA in many ways; he writes in a scholarly fashion and makes some attempt at impartiality. However, readers should be aware that Coogan is of a strongly pro- Irish Republican bent. To those more familiar with the nuances of Irish History, the weaknesses of this account become manifest. He does liitle to emphasise how small the IRA's support base is, and that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland wish to remain British ( the 6 counties are not occupied!! ) Nor does he highlight sufficiently how the IRA is opposed by most Roman Catholics( many of whom they have killed for their opposition to the IRA) and condemned by all parts of the Church; he downplays its links to Colonel Gadaffi and other terrorist illuminati. Finally, in the post ""ceasefire"" situation, more needs to be said about ongoing IRA punishment attacks against the Catholic community, and the IRA's sponsorship of the growing drugs trade in Ireland."
2,not a complete or well written book,"This reminded me of reading, or writing, a grammer school research paper. It seems like it was researched in an encyclopedia. Everyone claims it is a ""great"" book, but I disagree strongly. The subject matter is interesting, but the book is sloppy and the author is pompous. As a reader I can do without self-serving references by the author to himself. It seems Mr. Coogan is the Irish equivalent of Forrest Gump."
4,excellent book,excellent book for any IMG who needs to know more about US system of medicine.I just got into residency program and this book has taken care of all my questions.I feel more confident in going into unchartered territory.
4,overall a good book for IMGs,"This is a book for the IMGs,by the IMG.It contains all the information of what to do in united states as an IMG to successfully pass USMLE and get in to residency match program.It contains information of difficulties an IMG has after he just entered residency.It introduces you to what is actually there in residency and what it takes to be a good resident.But it doesnt contain information on how to select your program or what to ask for in an interview which i found it in Iversons getting in to residency.Neverthe less i am proud to own this bookamaresh"
1,Good but no the tour at ALL!!!!!,"I was at the Tour in Dallas, yes Mudvayne did leave before the concert there, but they still should of used their actual concert songs, not some of another Tour. They also should have put Rammstein on b/c they WERE on the Freaking Tour, but not the CD. Strange. It is extremely to short and the quality of the Mudvayne tracks [stunk]. You cant hardly hear the words. I will never buy a tour cd from whoever put this one out. Dont BUY IT. One star b/c it has great bands, but lacks the TOUR it self."
1,"I do not have this CD (ignore the star rating), but...","Sorry, I guess I really do not have a right to write this because I don't own the CD nor did I attend the concert, but what about Rammstein??? They were on the tour, they deserve every bit of appreciation as well! Dont get me wrong, I like the other groups who played, but Rammstein should most definately not be overlooked."
3,It doesn't recreate the tour,"This CD is alright, but does not recreate the tour. The American Head Charge track is top notch, but the System of a Down and Slipknot songs definetely do not sound great on this cd. The Mudvayne songs are pretty decent, but I could care less about No One. The AHC and Mudvayne stuff are good, but the rest is average at best. The sound quality reminds me of the Tattoo The Earth Live CD if you have that. The system and Slipknot songs just do not sound good."
5,Living Beyond The Daily Grind,"""Living Beyond The Daily Grind"" by Charles Swindoll is a collection of readings from 2 of the wisdom literature books of the Bible (Psalms, Proverbs) to address daily life issues which threaten to wear us down.Several issues are covered in the 52 week devotion. Of course, the reader may want to shorten the reading period by reading more than one devotion on any given day. Some of the issues covered include:1. Compromise2. Uncertainty3. Divine Silence4. Worry5. Difficult People6. Feeling Overlooked7. Ritual Religion8. Sorrow and Grief9. Impatient Arrogance10. Laziness11. Imbalance12. Displeasing GodThese are just a few of the many topics covered. Typically, each devotion is around 10 pages, consists of appropriate verses from Psalms or Proverbs, and concludes with some reflections on the topic and how we may deal with the issue in God's strength.A great and encouraging read. Recommended."
1,Waste of money.,"Instead of buying this product. Go out and buy some spray bottles and some food coloring. There you go, you just saved a ton of money and got a better result. The bottles that come in this box leak, so you end up with stained winter clothes. There are only a couple of packs of dye in the box, so after one usage you need to go out and by some more coloring. There really is nothing to this product and what is provided is poor quality and flimsy."
2,Disappointed - Not much to this product,Great looking box - but not much inside. My kids were not engaged in making the snow shapes. The colored dye was fun to do - but we could have easily bought food coloring!
1,Does not work as advertised,"Nullo did not work for me though I took the maximum dosage advised.Given the fact that I did not have ANY reaction at all to taking the pills, I upped the dosage to the maximum daily dose(3 pills) in the hopes of reducing body odor. To say that I am very disappointed would be an understatement given the fact that I did not notice any reduction at all in body odor. I definitely will not be buying this ever again and will be throwing the few remaining pills in the nearest trash can."
3,work fine but..,"on each cartridge, there's a little tab at the top that can be opened. i figure you can empty the old charcoal and fill it with new charcoal and reuse the container. you can buy a large quantity of charcoal that can last you a long time and would be much cheaper than buying the cartridges."
4,Great pan!,"As always Wilton has great pans. I first purchased a couple of these pans many, many years ago and I have never been disappointed. My cakes came out easily. They don't appear to be a non-stick pan but the cakes always came out really well. Just to be on the safe side, if I think any cake I've made might possibly stick I put a piece of parchment cut to size in the bottom of the pans and I've never had a problem. I eventually purchased 2 more pans for other baking needs because 2 just wasn't enough. After years of baking in them, I finally had to replace a couple of them because they were pretty beat up from years of use and I figured it was time to replace them. I think after all these years replacing them with the same exact pan really says something for the pan!"
4,rare and innovative,"I am no jazz musician, but I think I can tell when a cat has some serious skill. Maulawi's only release instantly became one of my favorites. The music shows a wide-ranging palette of tastes. Each song is executed with a steady and high-level of energy. Street Rap is an opener for the ages. I mean it literally sounds like a weekend summer night in the inner city. Funky and frenetic. But pure genius. I was fortunate enough to find this gem hidden in a record store. If you are into rhythmic jazz this is one for you. Great, rare classic. For real. This album has a vibe that no other album I can think of possesses."
5,the perfect anthology! and a whole new experience,what a one disc anthology should be!great choice picks made by the founders themselves.not a bad song in the bag!this one covers all their true best and then some you might've missed.I was really taken by the 1989 demo of Outdone. the flow of the song is the best I have ever heard it before!every song is given a different feel than the albums gave. WHAT! you ask. the different song order I say. this disc as a whole feels really good all the way through. the album releases cut the songs open with a sharp intense blade showing the center meat of UT. 100% pure..........if you are a new or old fan of UT then this is a great disc to have. it's a whole new experience and a great introduction.
5,Excellent Anthology,"This is really the band that launched a million bands. I've never spent a whole lot of time listening to UT's early stuff, although I own it all. Someone did a great job of picking through it and putting a lot of great stuff together... a great UT mix tape. I still think Anodyne was their finest hour, but there is a lot here to recommend it, even if you already have the original issues. The acoustic version of looking for a way out is very cool, that was always one of my favorite UT songs, but I always preferred the acoustic stuff myself.My only quibble is with the choices from Anodyne... no ""Key to My Heart""??? Anyway, you should have that whole album anyway. I've been listening to this ever since I got it, it never quite has the impact of a five star CD, but I can't stop listening to it. Maybe it's just knowing what was coming next...My wish would have been for a reunion track. Come on, just one song, guys? Both your bands are breaking up. The time is now."
5,An American Masterpiece,"I have to admit I am late in coming to the party-BUT I am glad I am there now. Without a doubt one of the top 10 bands to have emerged from the US-this album is a perfect introduction to their amazing talent-check out track 12 "" Sauget Wind "". In a word a Masterpiece. I love Uncle Tupelo--"
4,?,"This has alot of good songs on it. Show me (or showishima) is a really good track, as is Zutto (Zutto Zettai). This is a definate must have for any person who likes Jpop, but to those out there who don't like Jpop, techno or disco, this type of music is not for you."
4,Eat This Book,"What a great read! The stories vary from the classic (Steinbeck's Migrant People brought tears to my eyes) to edgy noir to humor to speculative fiction, encompassing film parody, inspiration from 9/11, and more. I found it to be a very diverse read, with more flavors than Baskin-Robbins. Dig in as your cold scoop melts on steaming asphalt."
1,a retread,"A retread title to go with a lot of retread writing. Nothing new or exciting here, move on down the road - there's a lot of great travel writing to be found out there."
1,"Dull, flat, uninspiring prose","My reaction to reading this book was, very simply, ""So what?"" A book such as this one amply justifies the decision by so many publishers to drop mid-list authors. A previous reviewer recommended the work of Pulitzer and MacArthur winner James Alan McPherson, and I took his/her advice. I'm gratified and pleased that I did, because it's fabulous."
1,Transcendently bad.,"Every now and then a book gets published and then reviewed in some fairly respectable publications, and one wonders why. This is just such a book."
1,Ho-hum.,"If you wait, you can pick this one up off the remainder tables for a dollar in a month or two. Utterly forgettable."
1,"Small stakes, big verbiage","Reginald McKnight puts a great deal of effort into small-stake ideas. One looks for a pay-off after wading through so much descriptive verbiage, but there is none, and his leaps into big thinking fall flat. Too bad zero stars is not an option here."
1,So what?,"My reaction after reading this collection of short stories was, simply, ""So what?"" McKnight is not saying anything new, nor is he saying anything in a new way. I don't know what his target audience is, but I can say with certainty that I will not be among them in future."
5,A TWIST and a PINCH of STEREO!!!,I am a huge Sal Mineo fan and collector. I own so many versions of his songs but this cd is by far the best! It's about time Sal Mineo's music was released in excellent stereo sound. It makes such a dramatic difference. These songs were so popular in the late 1950's when Sal Mineo was one of the hottest movie stars on the planet and I am so so so very happy this cd was released!
4,Lots of fun and picture always changes,got this to refill my daughters present. the liquid goes quick so make sure to get a refill.
2,Blah,"Incredibly repetitive yet incessantly unclear, Rizzo's text is a bore. Find a different art direction book if you are seeking such information."
4,Great Book,This book was a great help to me. It is full of lots of useful information and clearly defines the role of an art director.
1,Give me that hour + back!,"Dear God this movie is AWFUL! You would have to go a long, long way to find such incredibly poor acting. This film needs to be deleted from any digital outlet that is mean enough to serve it."
2,did i miss something ????,"ok did i miss something ???? i cant believe this movie got an average of 4 stars...really ???? i kept watching thinking a huge twist was going to happen but nothing.....it kind of reminded me of 3 friends getting together to make a movie & also kind of reminded me of a really awesome show called ""the walking dead ""........hmmmm was this movie made before or after the airing of walking dead LOL & hmmmm who copied who LOL.........sorry walking dead dont mean to compare u - there is no comparison - walking dead awesome....this movie not so much......and what was with the chickens....i was so hoping there was going to be this really weird storyline with the chickens or the blood that was dripping into the trashcan from the dog or all those graves but...........well nothing........i guess i just didnt get the creativity...sorry..........."
3,"Great design, but not for everyone.","After getting my braces on and having this product recommended to me by the assistant at the orthodontist's office, I went out and bought a pack of this. While flossing is easier, the regular floss was a pain in the rear-end to use. As reviews have stated, the floss is more round than others causing it to barely make it's way through tight teeth. It took a lot of work to floss my top teeth and the floss did not even go in between my bottom teeth. It was painful and did not work for me, so I'm giving this product 3 stars since it may work for some."
1,Horrible product!,This stuff not only shreds but it also shreds off IN BETWEEN YOUR TEETH and gets stuck. There is stuff on other sites about it. I just went through a horrible experience and product support was terrible. They basically said it would not hurt anything to have it stuck there. Unbelievable!
5,James Harrion Book,I was amazed at the quality of this book and the price was exceptionally good. Amazon.com does a great job.
1,disappointed,This wasn't at all what I wanted. It was suppose to be the book that has all the little tid bits of things to do...such as lemon juice to clean...ect Instead I got a religious book. Not what I wanted at all. Ended up in the garbage!
3,my rating is 3.5 out of 5,"This book is useful for Hollywood actors but for those in the theater industry, its a toughy due to the fact that casting directors or collegiate judges want monologues from established plays and most of the monologues come from Shakespearean events, which is basically events where playwrights hope to get there name out.... basically, the plays aren't established. So if you audition for local theater or indie stuff, hollywood area productions.... great, but for NYC auditions, stick with something else,"
1,No help whatsoever,"This book did not help me at all. I am a young teen actress and I did not find any good monologues. A lot of them were for older actresses and actors and were really religous, talked about sex, or were just really disturbing or boring. Even though it says student, it is more for adults. I really want to return this book. It was a waste of my parents money. If I could, I would give it no stars. The beginning does give some helpful information about monolgues, but it gets really boring to read. DONT make the same mistake I made. The other reviews said it was really good, but trust me, it's not."
1,VERY SMALL,"NEVER THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE SO SMALL.- CAN HADRLY GET 4 LIPSTICKS TO FIT.- THEY SHOULD NOT SHOWTHAT PICTURE OF THE ""ACRYLIC DRAWER ORGANIZER""- I BELIEVE IT WAS A REAL ""RIP-OFF"", TO CHARGE ME $7.00 PLUSFREIGHT FOF A LITTLE PLASTIC BOX THAT IS 2"" X 2"" X 2"".-THE LEAST THEY COULD DO, IS SENT ME THE ACRYLIC DRAWER ORGANIZERS,JUST AS IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE.-I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE COMPANY TO ANYONE."
2,Rust-Belt Supervising Techniques in New Age Clothing,"This short pamphlet dwells more on disciplinary aspects of supervisor-employee sessions than on true coaching. It tries too hard to solve every problem in a one-shot encounter with an employee.The book pretends to be about improvement through coaching, yet the encounters described in each example have too much of the usual ""you-did-wrong-now-fix-it"" Theory X style of management that true coaching avoids.However, the examples are a definite improvement over the usual tactics described as the usual approach to employee performance problems. A better read, for only a few bucks more, would be COACHING FOR IMPROVED WORK PERFORMANCE, by Ferdinand F. Fournies. While Cottrell & Layton's book will get you to first base, you really need a long-term solution that will create self-sufficient, self-correcting workers."
1,Dn't bother - Poor quality DVD,I started to watch this DVD and was immediately concerned with the poor quality of the video. I have a 50 inch HD TV and the picture looked grainy and fuzzy. To make matters worse it stopped playing about 15 minutes into a 50 minute video. No matter what I did it wouldn't play beyond the first 15 mintues. Maybe I just got a bad one - but from what I could tell this product isn't worth watching.
1,Don't buy this DVD,"This DVD is not as advertised. It is a 10 minute video that repeats 6 times to have a so called 60 minute ""running"" time. I returned it to Amazon because it was clearly misrepresented in their product discription."
3,Oral B Brush,The brushes were too flimsy but it was an OK product. The handles came with two brushes in the package.
5,NEED,"Classics One WHITE: DEEN's first Maxi Single ever, shows you the power of Acoustic, Capella, and Christmas! Shuichi Ikemori, shows his powerful perfect singing tunes! DEEN's first single ""Konomama kimidake wo"" played in Acoustic Version, and 4th Single ""Eienwo Azuketekure"" in a Capella version. 3 special tracks of instrumental Christmas songs, and ""The Room"" a great DEEN style song. The last CD DEEN ever released in December, 1999, Christmas Time!!"
2,NOT TO GOOD!!,Compre este enchufle para mi televisor y computadora preocupada por los voltaje y pues al mes de tenerla se fundio todo el lado derecho de los enchufles una porqueria totallll !!!no la recomindo perderas tu dinero..
1,I should have listen to the other reviewers,"After only 6 weeks four of the outlets stopped working. I am not even going to return this item, because I do not want a replacement. I will find something else locally. Monster used to have a good name, but the last 3 items I bought all failed. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
1,Garbage,"I bought two of these from a local Monster dealer, Best Buy. One just died and the other started to buzz after only about a year of use. I also have a Whole Home Surge Surpressor on my electrical panel, so it would take all the hits long before it would get up to my TV etc., so they didn't die while saving me from anything.I took them back and got two new ones... one of them was dead on arrival and the other one had a broken receptical."
1,"Expensive, big and heavy",I would not recommend this product. I have owned it for about a year and have had 2 power outlets fail on it. Do some research and get a UPS device from APC who is knows for their surge products. This product is also very large so if you don't have much room behind the cabinet etc. review the dimensions first.
3,"Nice product, but nothing special","I figured if you're investing thousands in an entertainment system it doesn't make sense to be cheap with protecting it, so i pulled the trigger on this product. Contrary to Monster's claims, I did not notice a marked increase in picture or sound quality. Perhaps this is because both were very good already. Bottom line, it gives me peace of mind that my equipment is safe."
4,Nice price on Amazon (that's right Best Buy!!),"Digital readout is cool, kinda shows you that its working. The power at the outlet I am using varies from 120 to 126, so it should be helping. I'm not so convinced that the Phone and Cat-5 jacks (DSL/Internet) do any filtering. The information flows through the Phone and Cat-5 jacks whether the power strip unit is plugged into the wall or not. Maybe those are strictly for surge and don't filter. Not sure, anyway, great deal on a sweet power strip."
4,my second purchase of this item,"This saved my tv,cable box and Boise entertainment system when our town had a huge power surg. The protector took the hit but did not loose any electronics. The surg protector started making a high pitched sound so needed replaced. But it did the job."
5,"Buy it from Amazon, not Best Buy!!!!!!!","This line conditioner sells for $190 at ""Best Buy"" but I bought it new for $107 on Amazon. Same identical product. Don't get ripped off....buy it from Amazon.It is a great item, and I feel really good I have it on line."
2,The honest truth...,"My main issue with this item is the fact that the sockets for plugging items in are not straight, not only does this make it very difficult to actually plug an item in it has rendered two of the sockets on mine unusable because it was so out of line nothing could actually go in. Other than that like many Monster items though it may look nice and powerful, that is purely cosmetic, it is very over priced for what it is. I have not had any issues with the operation of the device other than the unusable sockets but there are many significantly cheaper devices that would have been better."
2,Humming noise and other noises,"Have had this for over 3 years and am now hearing a humming noise. Over the weeks that the humming noise started, it is not getting louder and louder and almost sounds line an APC unit when it is in test mode. Going to replace it with something else as I don't trust it now due to the noises."
1,way overpriced and will die in a few years with no costomer service,"I bought mine from best buy less than 4 years ago and it just started making a loud buzzing sound like a cold florescent shop light and smelled of ozone. I unplugged it and called customer service and they said that they have changed their policy of standing by the quality of their product to only standing by it IF you have the original receipt. Well that certainly isn't expressed or implied on the packaging.I've checked on the internet and this is a very common problem and Monster knows it, they just don't want to deal with it. $150 divided by 4 years is $37/yr. I am sure there are other products out there that can do as much as this did at a much better price. Heck, The extended warrantee at Best Buy is probably cheaper than this and everyone knows how much of a scam that is.Monster won't help you. They don't want to help you. They just want to sell you pretty turds at very high prices and move on to the next sucker.Avoid them."
2,Hums after a few years,"This product emits a humming sound after a few years. I don't know why but it's loud enough that you can hear it across the room. I owned two of these. Both started humming after a few years, so Monster is two for two on this problem."
1,Not Clean Power,I have all my expensive audio and video equipment plugged into this strip including my Martin Logans and Paradigm Sub. Every time we turn the fan off in the bathroom the Sub POPS. That sounds to me like the Monster Strip is not filtering out the noise in the line. I would never buy another Monster product to include there way OVERPRICED cables. All you pay for is the advertising and name.
2,Same problem as many others have posted,"I have had the unit for a few years. It has just started making a loud humming / buzzing sound. Called Monster, and they will only return with the original receipt - which I no longer have of course. Given that the problem seems to be quite common, you would expect the company would do a better job of standing behind it.I have purchased a lot of Monster products over the years. My expectation is that you pay more for them than comparable products, but that the quality is better, and the company stands behind their products. Apparantly, that is not true."
1,Total overpriced garbage,"I have had two of these power conditioners which I spent a lot of money on. Both have died without warning. I called Monster as my booklet says it is warrantied ""For the Life of the Product"" Thinking it had a lifetime warranty I called them. They told me it only had a 5 year warranty which is the life of the product. Give me a break!This product is overpriced hype for suckers that think they are getting good protection and filtered power. The only thing you are getting is less money in your checking account."
1,STOPS WORKING AND SHORT WARRANTY,"I bought the HTS 1000 to protect my home theater equipment. This weekend I started hearing a buzzing noise. I tracked it down to being the HTS 1000 itself. Four of the eight outlets are no longer working with the switch. They remain on whether the HTS 1000 power switch is ON or OFF. While the $350,000 connected equipment warranty sounds good, it turns out the warranty on the device itself is only FIVE years. Given the way that it failed (loud buzzing noise and outlets no longer working) it just really diminished my trust that it was ever protecting my equipment. If you go read the reviews on Monster's website itself you will see many people have had similar or worse experiences. Given that, I will be going with a different brand in the future."
5,Max,"Monster HTS 1000 MKIII is a great product to protect home theater electronics. I have bought a second Monster HTS 1000 MKIII product for my bedroom TV/accessories. I feel safe I did this again.Highly recommended if you have electric interference in your room or electric power problems in your area. Even if you don't, a freak electric problem could happen, so protect your expensive equipment. Monster has warranty with registration. Check their website monsterpower.com on warranty registration. I feel its quality control has a good history. Therefore I would recommend purchasing this product."
2,high price but low quality,Not impressed with the quality of this product. Upon receiving it and plugging it in for the first time I noticed a section of the red LED voltage display was burnt out and would not function. I did not send it back because otherwise it still worked and would have cost me return shipping and hassle to do so. Very disappointed with the quality and quality control (or lack thereof) with these high priced monster products. Purchase at your own risk...
2,"Not as advertised, Does not make channels clearer","The part about maker channels clearer and stopping the lines from the lower stations is false I think it made it worst since i had hooked it today since I recieved it. I unhooked the cable wires and just left the items plugged in and it seems to work better. So the part about making your viewing better is false. As a surge protector hopefully that is true and works and the guarantee about the equipment is true hopefully i never need to find out but I guess it could be a sense of security from surges. I think if I can return this product I will and get a cheaper one like Belkin or one that is warrantied for life. I think this is anexpensive piece of garbage, thank god i didnt buy it at Best Buy where its $80 more."
1,Dead in four months!,"I got this for my home theater and work for 4 months.Simply stop working.No lights, nothing to do. Dead!Try something else, because this unit did not worth the money!"
5,Monster HTS 1000 MK III,"The product is excelent, the handling and shipping the worst, shame on you Amazon, you are going down."
2,An overpriced piece of junk!,"I purchased this product hoping to protect my investment. Within 2 days it was tripping out & the voltage meter was reading 221 instead of 120 or so. E-maile Monster several time, but never a response. I will never buy an overpriced Monster product again."
3,Worked fine for over 5 years,"Bought this for my home theatre system. I've never used the system without this unit, so I can't comment about any improvement in performance, but after just over 5 years of use, it's recently started making a humming noise. The humming has now increased to a loud buzz that does not go away if I unplug all the components that are connected to it. When it's buzzing, you can actually feel a slight vibration inside the unit. Oh, well. I got 5 years of use out of it."
5,It really works!,"I gotta say that this thing is very heavy and big. The outlets are very hard to get a plug in. But once you do the plug is there to stay.I bought this because my picture didn't look as good as it should for a 2011 set. Once I hooked it up, the TV has a much sharper picture. Took the line bleed out as well. The sound from my TV also sounds a little better.Also connected my 360 and PS3 to this... They both seem to run a bit quicker and produce a little less heat.I love the voltage read out... Say's I have 122-124... But the unit did not shut off because my voltage is a little high. Which means that according to the manual that it's safe.Overall I'm pleased with this item. I just hope it gives me many years of service."
5,awesome buy,i was not sure if this was going to give my samsung a better and cleaner picture but was i wrong awesome ...
2,Power Bar Purchase Review,"I made this a present and bought it new from the site. It even said on all documents it was new. However after receipt it proved to be poorly packaged, like a used one, and there was no instructions manual, no manufacturer's info at all."
3,Monster Protection,"I have only been using this product for a few days and have had no issues with it so far. My only BIG problem is that when I opened the box from Amazon, it smelled like someone had blown cigarette smoke in the box and it came wafting out and smelled disgusting."
1,Wrong Item,"Monster HTS 1000 MKIII PowerCenter with Clean Power Stage 2 (8 AC outlet, 2 coax, phone & network). I ordered the refernced product however Amazon had associated the wrong product ID number which resulted in my not receiving the correct product. I returned and received a prompt refund. I also received a 25.00 gift certificate from the retailer. Mistakes do happen and I am satisfied with how this mistake was resolved."
3,infromative,I find the book very informative and helpful. I would recomend it for those who seek to take the MTA Train Operator test.
1,Nothing like the test,My NY MTA employee boyfriend warned me and I should have listened. This book will do very little to prepare you for the test. I can't even bring myself to resell it as I feel I would be giving someone who needs a job false hope by using it.Save your money.
2,"OK story, weak writing style","The book provided lightweight diversion when waiting for busses or when nothing is on the TV, the setting, storyline and characters were cozy in a twee, Olde English way, but the weak writing style really got in the way. The prose is littered with cliches and lazy terminology, including adjectives as 'lovely' and 'ordinary'. These words (unless used in dialogue) is inexcusable in a novel. I could not immerse myself in the story or feel concerned about what what happened next, although I ploughed onwards to the end. I also feel an opportunity had been missed to make Mike Sinclair, the rector more sinister and interesting. He was the best element of the story and held it (albeit a little) together. Sadly, the characters were flat and the story was too long."
4,Dark and Mysterious!,"I just finished reading this book. I've always been a fan of Barbara Erskine and this book lives up to her usual standards. It's a great read in the dark and the place she sets the book gives off a wonderful atmosphere, evoking witches and the Ward, a sort of pre-medieval protector of the village. The ending is quite suprising. My only complaint would be that we never find out where Hopkins is buried, or what actually happened to him. Sorry, I've gone and blown the book now haven't I?A great read and one I would recommend."
2,Annoying clicks and pops,"Easy to install, just plug and play. The stereo jack mode has to be attached to the wall, though. A little annoying if what you need is mobility.So, the USB mode is the solution (which is, as stated in a previous review, just like having an external USB sound card) but, first of all, it has interference with my wireless network. I could manage to fix this by adjusting the channel on the transmitter, but somehow the problem comes back every now and then.But, what really annoys me is that you can hear click and pops without any apparent reason. I don't know if it's something related to my Windows drivers or something, but I haven't been able to fix this."
5,One Of The Finest Recordings Of Brahms' 2nd Piano Concerto,"I am grateful to Decca for combining both recordings of the final piano concerti composed by Brahms and Mozart; the Brahms is one of the finest I have heard. Wilhelm Backhaus demonstrate why he was one of the most acclaimed pianists of his generation, performing with much power, yet capable of ample tenderness when the score demanded it. I'm greatly impressed with his superb technical brilliance, which he maintains throughout both dramatic performances. In Karl Bohm he found a superb accompanist, who leads the Vienna Philharmonic in one of its usual warm, vibrant performances. There is ample splendid chemistry amongst Backhaus, Bohm and the orchestra. And yes, the sound quality is surprisingly superb, inspite of the age of the original analogue recordings."
3,"Decent but predictable, a good read","I love Donaldson. His Covenant Series, His science fiction, his mysteries. That having been said, This book, The Man Who Tried to get Away is not so special. The main characters are too flawed in it, the plot predictable enough so I guessed who the main perpetrator was.Still, if you love Donaldson you'll like this book. I enjoyed it.Leon"
2,Incomplete and really depressing,"First of all - Ty wrote these songs while going through a divorce. And from the words, she must have been one heckuva woman to reduce him to some of the lyrics on this album.The best tracks are ""Funeral"", which is the hardest song on the album and could easily be a King's X song, and ""Better to be left on hold"", a very witty song about how his wife is a ""countess"" and other words ending in ""-ess"", but shows his utter helplessness in the breakup.The problem is that this album depressed me. The songs that caught on I would sing in my daily life and the hopelessness overwhelmed my attitude toward MY wife, which doesn't really need that kind of input.A good view into his ""muse"", using it for an outlet. If you can handle the fact that view, then by all means partake. But it left me wanting. Some of the songs just didn't seem polished or complete enough, and most are not really rockers."
3,Half of a double album set,"Back in 1986 Mr. Cassidy released a very nice 2-record set in the U.K. called ""His Greatest Hits - Live"" and this cd is culled from that release. In fact it completely contains sides 1 and 2 in the same song order. Unfortunately sides 3 and 4 had the better material and they're nowhere to be found here. ""I am a Clown"" and ""I'll Meet You Halfway"" are stand outs while the track ""Daydreamer"" turns into a bizarre and awful medley of songs he never recorded. Very strange. Hopefully one day the entire show gets released on cd because his live versions of ""Looking Through the Eyes of Love"" and ""Rock Me Baby"" are surprisingly good and are sorely missed in this limited package."
4,DAVID RULES THE WORLD,"I have never been to a concert of David, simply because he never toured in Holland, and being twelve at the time I couldn't go to the UK for it (if I even knew then that he toured there at all). This CD gives you (I think)a good insight of his live performances. Little out of breath on some of the songs, and unfortunately sometimes you hear his voice has 'broken', but there is real good atmosphere. In his book he writes of the screeming girls at the halls, and yeah, they are there allright!.If you're a fan and never saw one of his concerts, buy it. If you saw his concerts, buy it too, you will feel like you are in your teens again. Songs are great and you get the 70's feeling of this guy who rules the world.Antoine Peters"
5,a must for the DavId Cassidy Fan,i like the way he sang the song darlin and all the other songs that are on the cd.
4,Great Album! Misleading cover!,"This album has had 2 different covers and they both picture David at about 24 years of age. Which makes u think u are getting cuts from his,""Cassidy Live"" album. But infact these songs are from a concert in like 1986. Reguardless this album has songs from David's OOP album ""Romance"" which all sound pretty good. He sounds a little older and a little like he was ""licking the curb"" but I do not regret buying this album one bit. David gets a thumbs up, and too bad no one will release his other solo albums anywhere....."
2,"Quasi Helpful -- mostly fluff, though","I hope the author, who posted that rave review here, received his degree from UF in marketing because he's very good at it. He's not so good as a journalist.I went out of my way to get this book for my son who will be attending UF in the fall. While there are small bits that I think might be useful to him, the majority of the book reads like someone sat down with the recent Census data and a phone book for Gainesville.I was hoping for something much more in depth and informative ... for that ""insiders view"" that was so hyped. I was sorely dissapointed and will probably return it."
5,Bat Jamboree is a fixture at our house...,"...and we're a childless family. We recommend you get this in hardcover, as it's a definate re-read (like, lots of times). We love the mix of vaudeville, bats, and the whimsical rhymes. If something ""Wasn't quite as fun as 'The Corgiville Fair'"" (see the book by Tasha Tudor), then it often was ""As fun as 'The Bat Jamboree'""...only because the Bat Jamboree is only for several hours (vs. all day). We've bought several copies of BJ for diverse audiences. One copy we gave to an old vaudeville fan, and another to our governor's baby daughter (there were bats infesting the governors' mansion about the time the book came out). A third went to an employee of an old drive-in theatre. A joy for young and old. You'll be ""batty"" over it."
2,Ehhh,"Book came in mail quick. Thats only thing liked about this purchase. The book would be ok if wasnt in such bad shape. Pages were torn, stains on it, and written in. Wont use again."
2,Didn't last one day,I bought this for my 6 yr old son last Christmas (2005) and unfortunately they didn't even last one day. The inflatable ends just couldn't handle the rough playing of a 6 yr old and the seams blew out within hours. They are a lot of fun to play with and if the ends had soft foam instead of inflatable balloons I'd buy them again.
5,Lose weight and feel great...I do!,"The Alkalive Green has helped me tremendously within the last year. Years previously I was trying everything, I mean everything to lose weight. I had tried and failed every ""fad"" diet that existed, and was quite sure I had nothing more I could do to help myself...until I tried the Alkalive Green and an alkaline diet. I take this product everyday and eat right and I have successfully lost the 20 lbs I have been trying so hard to lose. I know there are others out there with this exact same problem and my suggestion would be to try the Alkalive Green and an alkaline diet and you can shed the pounds just like me!"
3,Not bad - not great,"Does the job, but no surprise or delight. Does not exceed expectations, but is not a bad either. Bottom line, it's OK."
4,"Vietnam: Journeys of Body, Mind, and Spirit","This is a great effort between an American and an Vietnamese museum to create an interesting book about culture and traditions among many of Vietnam's people. There are tons of photographs and information about the many minority groups as well as the national Vietnamese residents of this populous country. Holidays, ceremonies, and religions are covered in quite some detail. I learned a lot from this book."
3,"Good for FR fans, but no one else.","Reasonably written, lots of forgotten realms details about Thay and the Red Wizards. Which gives the story a great backdrop. However the characters arn't that believable especially towards the end. I didn't have much empathy with a honest heroic spoilt thief. And i stuggled with the lich at the end. Without giving the story away I can't say much about the story. Apart from the character choices at the end wern't beileavable. But up until then things were pretty good.If you want to read about Thay and Red Wizards. This book is a must read. Otherwise its ok."
4,Good book,"Not as good as Elminster or Drizz't but The Rogues series is good. They do NOT, however, have any real relationship to each other, so do not need to be read in any particular order."
2,OVERALL SCORE: (C-),"The hero is a whining spoiled brat.The story is choppy and difficult to get into.The character motivations are convoluted and not believable.[A person of extreme wealth who steals the property of other people so she can get a kick out of the danger that she misses in her spoiled-pampered-self centered life, oh and she's GOOD and moral too????]OVERALL SCORE: (C-)READABILITY: (C-), PLOT: (D+), CHARATERS: (D-), DIALOGUE: (C-), SETTING: (C+), ACTION/COMBAT: (C), MONSTERS/ANTAGONISTS: (C+), ROMANCE: (n/a), SEX: (n/a), AGE LEVEL: (PG)"
2,First Forgotten Realms Novel I quit reading 80% into it...,"I have read nearly every single Forgotten Realms Novel since the first one released, and there have been stinkers before.But this one is so loosely thrown together, and seemed to be written on the fly as she thought it up. When a huge war breaks out, a easy 'out' is given to the Character, and became so...irrelevant and I didn't care about the character in any way. This is the first FR novel I quit reading, and I was near the end of the book. I have read Veronica's other novel in the Spider Queen Series, and it was great, so It was just this story I guess."
5,"Good, but I Wish More Could Have Been Included","I was so excited when I heard that Jon B. was releasing a greatest hits album. I finally got the opportunity to buy and listen to it, and it's just as I expected: it's really good! However, the one bad thing about it is that I wish songs like ""I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)"" could have been on the cd as well. I know that not all of everyone's favorites could have been on the album, but the ones that were chosen work. Jon's music is always on point and there's nothing bad I can say about that. I really look forward to his next album coming out!Any fan of Jon B.'s music and R&B music should buy this album. It's music at it's finest!"
1,So someone got killed? Do I care?,"This is the first in the Pennsylvania-Dutch murder series, and one can only hope that the series improves with practice. By the time I was one-third of the way through, I'd slogged through enough whining about how the main character had been deprived of all the normal adolescent fun (proms, etc.) while her much-younger sister got all the experience (and then ran off and married outside the community) that I was ready to scream as loudly as the author has the characters hollering. To call the dialogue ham-handed is to give it more credit than it deserves. And the main character doesn't solve the murder -- the murderer conveniently attacks her and then confesses, outlining all of the steps in the murder -- no brainpower needed at all. Why bother?"
4,A witty and fun cozy mystery,"I'll admit, I never tried the recipes, but some of then did look good. That said, this is like all of the other Tamar Myers Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries I've read: fun. Good, guilt-free, laugh-inducing fun. Myers' sense of humor alternates between dry and over the top; but in the process she still manages to create fairly believable and consistent characters."
4,Who Knew the Amish Were so Funny?,"This is a wonderful book in a great series. I originally read this book when I was looking for new culinary mysteries. To my delight, I discovered that this was also a humorous mystery. I laughed aloud several times during the course of reading this book. The characters are all interesting, particularly the regulars, Magdalena, Susannah, Freni, etc. The author did a nice job describing the personalities of the guests and the ensuing friction between them. I found the homespun dialogue and descriptions to be enchanting and engaging. The storyline is fun and interesting, with a plot that allows you to figure out ""whodunit"" if you put some thought into it. The recipes included after each chapter is a pleasant plus. A thoroughly enjoying, cozy read that leaves you anxiously waiting for the next book in the series."
5,I love a good clean pun...,"Bought the book yesterday and finished it today! I laughed when I saw what is probably her real family's cameo in the book - her husband as the vacationing Chief of Police, and his wife, who is, obviously, our author... Mrs. Myers has a very clever way with words, and I will be reading more of her books. Thanks!"
3,En Vogue greatest hits collection,I was always a fan of this ground in the 90's...there aren't any singing groups like them nowadays. They can all sing and harmonize well together.
4,We don't need two Greatest Hits CDs with En Vogue,"En Vogue have done some of 90's best soulpop songs. Classics like ""Hold On"", ""My Lovin'"", ""Dont Let Go(Love)"" and ""Whatta Man"". The girl groups of today is not near En Vogue. I can't understand why anyone will release two greatest hits albums, and none of the albums has any new tracks on. But now they have released this one, and not even ""Riddle"" is on it. We want new music from the girls. Hopefully they will come back with a new, good album."
3,Just missing something,"Don't get me wrong, the idea behind this game is great. I just personally find myself speeding through games just to get to the off- season parts, then simply losing interest all together. The ability to play with any team throughout history is super, but the free agency and off-season signing parts are just not realistic enough. Basically if you pay any player enough, he will sign with you and no other teams will compete for super stars. By the end of the 1st season, you can easily have an all star team assembled. And I know the argument of real players going for the money too, but there are still some players who want to stay where they are despite contract offers. This game doesn't offer that at all, and the computer simply does not try to out bid you for any player, ever. Check out out of the park baseball if you want actual strategy during the off season."
4,GREAT BUT...,"...pratically unplayable from out of the box. When I first installed it many of the transaction screens were minimized and I was unable to enlarge them. The good news is there is an auto update in a pull down menu. The Mogul guys seem pretty good with the updates. There have been two updates in the last two weeks. The last update added visible ""overall/peak"" directly to the lineup and pitching rooster. The only problem is this update addded some bug to the play-by-play."
4,fun party game,"I used this game during a recent Casino party we had and it was a big hit. The races are exciting and people were actually up on their feet screaming just like they were at the races. I actually played this on a huge projection screen.The downside is that all the horse info is on the DVD so I had to make up paper programs myself for it, but I still would recommend it."
1,Mis-Labeled Soft Toothbrush - It is NOT Medium,"I ordered a few of these toothbrushes. Each one is labeled, ""Medium."" However, when I used one, I found that the bristles are for a SOFT toothbrush. FYI, although each one costs less than a buck, the seller charges nearly TWO BUCK TO SHIP EACH ONE !! This is even though all of them will be shipped in the same heat-sealed plastic bag. There's one other thing. This toothbrush does not fit inside the old fashioned ceramic tile toothbrush holder in my bathroom. Even though the handle may appear skinny in the picture, it's not skinny enough to fit in those old fashioned built-in holders that so many of us have in our bathrooms. Bottom Line: Don't buy it if you expect the bristles to be anything but soft. Don't buy it if you think two dollars per unit is an exorbitant shipping fee. Don't buy it if you expect it to fit in an old fashioned toothbrush holder."
2,Fantasy Trash Novel,"This is a shallow book which meanders in no direction with no particular point, the ending is trite. A fine book for light read and buying second-hand, not worth buying new...."
3,An interesting epic novel.,"It is a story, about an Englishman living in India when it was an English colony. He adopts an orphan baby, and the novel is about all this. How the boy grows up, etc. etc. You can say it is an adventures book. Nice to read, but nothing extraordinary."
4,Good Resource But Could Have Been Better,"This book will serve as a good resource for those seeking out high quality porn. But I would have preferred if the films had been ranked from 1 to 500 or perhaps chronologically from 1972 to the present. Instead it's an alphabetical list and makes for somewhat boring reading.The emphasis is on the most acclaimed directors such as Michael Ninn, Andrew Blake and John Leslie. So if your interest is in a particular porn star or a certain genre you may be disappointed. This is still a worthwhile purchase but it could have been much better."
5,A great mop,"I have both the dust mop and the regular mop from MysticMaid.I have re-ordered more of the regular mops as I have a small child inmy home and I need to mop often, you can use the regular mop wetor dry, I also use it to apply a clean and shine product to my nowax floor. They wash and wear very, very well and I know they havesaved me money and time. The Cloud Duster Mop is the best dry mopI've used on my floors. It's large fluffy surface grabs onto dirtand dust and keeps it on the mop, it also gets pet hair and if youhave more than one mop you can do a thorough job without having to puton another disposable mop and throw 2 away. I highly recommend thisproduct as I have bought and used many, many other mops before buyingthis line of products, nothing else compares."
5,The best so far!,"I have used many kinds of dust mops, from the old fashioned yarn heads to the Swiffer (and a Libman microfiber that I don't know what they were thinking). Swiffers were ok, but I really don't like using disposable items if I don't have to. The cost of these gives one pause, but I'm really happy with this mop. It works much better than a Swiffer and the mop head washes up beautifully (no dryer please, just hang to dry). I have two cats, an eternally shedding dog, and two, well, guys around. It really cleans up - really gets that fur and most of the dirt as well. I need some help around the house and others who've tried it out have commented on how well it works. It's very light, has a nice long handle, and is easy to manipulate. Despite the price, I would still recommend this mop head for the Mystic Maid. A great addition if you have their damp mop model."
5,Love this dry mop!,"This is the best dry/dust mop I've ever used on my floors. The amount of dirt it picks up (even AFTER I have just vacuumed them) is incredible. Makes the floors feel clean and spotless in between moping them. And, when your mop head gets too dirty, you just pop it in the washing machine with a cold water load and voila! Your mop is sparkling clean again and ready to attack your dirty floors!"
3,not that great,"Doesn't work as well as I had hoped, that static feature that grabs up dust,, I just don't see it happening here."
3,Put the Adjustment on the side of the strut then 5 stars!,"The adjustment for the strut is on the top and is extremely difficult and confusing to install, that being said once u get it installed it is an excellent product would give it 5 stars if the adjustment was on the metal body like the rears..."
4,Missing Great Song,"A good album with most of their classic hits. But I just don't understand how you can have an Isley Brother's Greatest Hits album without including one of their best songs, ""This Old heart of Mine"". A very serious omission if you ask me."
5,Listen all way through without skipping,Most people including myself buy a Cd and will skip through to listen to their favorite song but this soundtrack of their greatest hits is right on time. I love this Cd all of the music is treasure to have and I will enjoy listening to them.
5,Surprise ending,"If you like a surprise ending, this book has a touching, bittersweet one. A young kid does not have a great life ahead of him, and his story is written in a realistic, compelling way. The predictable ending would have him not amounting to much but the author puts an O.Henry-esque spin on this novel. A good quick read."
3,I BE A LIVE M.C.!!! (3.999999 stars),"First.......I'm a fan of Heather B. from way back when she was rocking with KRS-1 and BDP and before her MTV ""Real World"" fame. She has 10 plus years in the game and still delivers the underground lyrical heat. A friend said she sounded too much like Eve......lol.....after laughing at him for being young and dumb to underground hip-hop, I told him thats like saying Stevie Wonder sounds too much like Musiq & Glenn Lewis. This is her 3rd CD and I've managed to collect them all. If your looking for a lyrical female MC with battle style rhymes, metaphors and a host of top producers including DJ Premier, Pete Rock and more........then you need this.fav gems:Live MCYou Goin' DownI Will Never ChangeYoung Gifted and Black"
3,"Different concept than ""Takin' Mine""","Heather B was in a different place with this album. ""Eternal Affairs"" has less aggressive lyrics compared to her first album. I preferred the previous style."
1,Pulled away from window frame,"I used this product to apply shrink wrap to our windows for some added winter insulation. Unfortunately when heat from the hair dryer was applied (to shrink wrap the film), the tape pulled away from the window making it useless. I've insulated our windows like this for the last 3 years and it was my first time using this tape. I've never had this problem with other tapes in the past. I recommend looking for a stronger tape."
3,save heat or ac,Product works but it's not clear at all. Don't use it on a window you want to see out of.
5,perfect,"This was a very hard to find item for our son in Japan. He is very particular about his dental care, being so far from home, and we were unable to get these toothbrushes anywhere else. Quick response made this a perfect item to include in his Christmas package. Thanks."
4,Helpful guide :-),"Lonely Planet are always the source I go to when looking to research a new vacation spot. Their books are informative and helpful and they are compact enough to take with you if nessesary.The featured highlights in the book are places like Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, Hearst Castle, Point Arena Lighthouse, Griffith Park and Queen Mary - so they have the main points covered. They show you various detours you can make if you are travelling by car so you can see other places that may normally not be seen by you. They go into the usual information that they normally do such as History and Culture, and then it's broken up into sections like North Coast, San Fran and the Bay Area, Central Coast, LA Area, San Diego Area. I find that by the time they talk about restaurants and hotels and tourist spots in each town, there is pretty much nothing uncovered. For this reason, I highly recommend this book. It gives you plenty of places to think about when making your travel plans."
3,Attitude adjustment,"John Hartford was always able to make be feel better. I pulled this album out shortly after his death and found that could not quit playing it. Lively tunes that are loaded with fiddles and harmonies, Hartford delivers on every tune. The instrumentals are tight and the songs have clever lyrics that seem to be thoughfully composed. Only a couple of songs seem like fillers and several are memorable. I found the cd in a bargain bin and played it for my son when he was small. Like all of John's work the cd provided phrases that we have bounced off each other for years. I was looking to buy a copy for my son. Too bad its unavailable, but many of his albums have been reissued. Someday maybe all of his work will be rereleased. If you find it in a bargain bin, buy it."
4,Strong bluesy voice--,"After seeing the Commitments, I fell in love with his voice, if not his character. Bought this CD a few weeks ago and haven't stopped playing it since. Very mature sound, although he is still quite young. Don't understand why he's not better known..."
5,met all my expectations,"I bought this cd on the basis of Andrew Strong's performance in ""The Commitments"". I was certainly not disappointed! His song choices reflect the same kind of material from the film and he performs them very well. This is a terrific adjunct to the soundtrack(s) from the film."
2,a must buy,"After watching The Commitments, a movie, and hearing Andrew Strong's voice, I bought all two CD's available in the U.S. With this purchase of his third CD I was extremely pleased. Most of the songs were NOT on his other two CD's and for that I am grateful. I love his voice. I wish he would perform in the US."
3,"great cover, but the screws are hard to get in",something about the screws being flat at the end and so big makes them hard to put in. or maybe it's just our wall (it's kind of rough :/--but other stuff has gone in fine. I think it's just these screws. but the cover is a great fit.
5,About time we had some more Eazy,"Yeah Eazy E pioneered gangsta rap, started a whole revolution before pac and biggie and was also was the original rappin ceo. Eazy, along with Mc ren, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and yella brought us lots of unforgettable classics as the group NWA. Eazy also had a keen eye for talent and jump start the careers of JJ FAD, MICHEL'LE, THE D.O.C. ABOVE THE LAW, CPO, KOKANE, SYLK E FINE, BLACK EYED PEAS, FROST, HWA, B.G. KNOCC OUT AND DRESTA, BLOOD OF ABRAHAM, AND BONE THUGS N HARMONY. Eazy was one of the fathers of GAngsta rap and his legacy continues with this including 6 unreleased songs plus a dvd featuring some videos and a documentary of his life. R.I.P. EAzyE"
5,FROM GANGSTER TO GANGSTER,I am amazed or you can sayed shock becouse Eazy-e came out with another cd even thow he has been dead for six years now.I DID
5,Poster,"I am thinking about buying this because I just baught a great eazy e shirt a few listings under this one. If anyone who has this can you please reply and give me a discription of the poster. is it big, what kind of picture is it? Write back please. R.I.P EAZY E"
5,One of the best ep's ever made,"Not only does the actual ep have 8 tracks and all of them being absolute classics the best thing about Impact of a legend is that It comes with a dvd featuring heaps of the ruthless records families hit video clips and the dvd also features a autobiography, a ruthless records mega mix and has unseen interviews with eazy-e. This ep is a must get for any Eazy-e fan."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has a great dvd with film-clips, lost footage, a ruthless records video megamix, a documentary & lots more. It also comes with a cd with 8 new songs. Every song on the cd is awesome. It also comes with a booklet comic and also a poster. This is one of the best albums i've ever bought."
5,The Godfather of Gangsta Rap Still Lives On,"I have never been a Huge Eazy-E fan. The only other Eazy-E album I have ever owned was Its On(Dre)187um Killa. But when I first saw this advertised, I knew that I would be waiting at the doors for the store to open on release day. Impact Of A Legend comes with so much more than Amazon advertises. It is a new cd called The Godfather of Gangsta Rap, With 6 new tracks. It also comes with a DVD that has a biography, 10 videos including Real Compompton City G's,Foe the Love of Money,BNK,Straight outta Compton. Most videos are UNEDITED TOO!!! It has TWO video games, a comic book based on Eazy's life, collectors poster, and many other special features on the DVD..."
5,One of the best rap dvds out there,"Unlike the other eazy e dvd (life and timez of eric wright), Impact of a legend is a masterpiece. Along with welcome to death row, and the up in smoke tour dvd, this is one of the best rap dvds out there. Not only is it a cd with all new eazy material, it comes with a dvd filled with awesomeness. A documentary with so much behind the scenes stuff, it also has a discography where you can sample every song eazy e ever made. There is a whole bunch of video clips streamed together in an ultimate ruthless compilation. This dvd is so sick, any eazy e fan out there should buy this right away. It even comes with a poster in the booklet."
1,What a piece o',"Worked great for the first 5-10 times I used it, then the thing fell apart. Literally it fell apart....rings of bamboo that were supposed to hold the grids in, popped out, loosened and couldn't be put back together again. Unfortunately it's after 30 days so I don't think I can return it now. Maybe this one was defective because the other reviews of this product seemed very positive. I personally am very disappointed with it."
5,A delicious investment,"This has been a delicious investment. We have used the steamer for vegetables and chinese dumplings, and it's great. No complaints so far."
2,They send me the wrong size.,"A 18-month old baby could wear the one they sent me. My baby is 4 months old. I didn't bother to send it back. I guess I'll wait for next year. The product it self looks cheap. You get what you pay for. In my case, its purpose was only for a couple of hours for pictures. (Halloween). But still I wouldn't recommended."
1,It is much cuter in the photo than on a child,"We bought this for a neighbor who only put their daughter in it on Halloween long enough to get a photo with our son (Darth Vader). She's an adorable kid, but the costume was really boring. Good luck adjusting the large felt cap to fit. The robe is simple and you really can't tell what the child is without explanation; let alone keep in on a child. With so many cute costumes out there I wouldn't reccommed this one at all!"
1,princess leia outfit,"I ordered a size 0 - 6 months but the 1-2 yr outfit was sent to me instead. I now don't have enough time to return the product and get another in time. others seem to have the same experiences as me which is disappointing to say the least. The quality is okay, but they seem to have the habit of sending whatever size they have to hand, rather than the one ordered. it's a really great idea, but I don't want to wait a year for my goddaughter to fit into this."
5,Princess cutie,"This costume was a total hit among the trick or treating. At the party she was a total hit among the adults. The costume was warm and toasty for the cold temperature. It ran just a bit big, but otherwise it was good. Order one size smaller. The hair had to be modified so it would fit her head better. That is what the sewing machine came in handy for."
4,Very Happy!,Very Cute and Although I bought for 0-9 months it is a little big for newborns. 6-12 months would be better fit.
2,Costume nothing like expected,Well we were excited to get the costume because her older brother is gonna be Luke. The dress is a foamy white felt and all other reviews were right the head piece is awful. She looked more like an Ewok. Anyway we were gonna fix her hair ourselves but really wanted the white dress to be cute and it's NOT. Normally I don't do reviews but this costume deserved one because it is not what you are going to want
2,Buy it elsewhere,"Costume measurements are irrelevant to the product. It is describe from the neck to the bottom and in appear to be bigger than it actually is. This specific costume has an elastic band in the ""waist"" so the majority of the length of the dress stays in the upper part making it very bulky. The sleeves are pretty long as well in comparison to the real length of the dress. I end up sewing it up instead of changing it for a smaller size since all the shipping costs are not courtesy of the seller when exchanging the product. I also had to stich up the hair, it is big and does not have any elastic or any other way to adjust it.It is what we were looking for, however it is sold in Target as well, there you can buy it, try it on and exchange-return if you need to."
3,"Actually found the robe sized pretty well; good quality robe 4 stars, head piece is a throw a way","We just took our little one out for her first Halloween party. People loved her in the costume and got Princess Leia right away. We did not use the head piece which is awkwardly and cheaply made. It is not good at all. But the robe is a lightweight fleece material with velcro closures. We got the 6 to 12 month. Our daughter is 13 months old but very small for her age. It felt well except the arms were too long. But I think it was size appropriate.The velcro makes it easy to take on and off. Get some white tights, white shoes, and try to make your child's hair look as much like Princess Leia as you can. Because the head piece is, sadly, very poorly done. 1 star on the heaf piece."
3,Way too big,"This costume would have been great, but it was way too large. The wig for the 6-12 month costume fit my husband. Needless to say, we had to return it"
3,Sent me the wrong size,"When I bought this item I purchased the infant size, when it came in the mail it was the toddler size. When I called them they said they were out of the infant size and could not exchange this. They also said that I ordered the toddler size but when I went back and reviewed what I had ordered this was not true. I believe they had run out of the infant size and rather than not fill the order, they just sent me what they had."
1,Who ever sized these does not have a kid,My only complaint was that i ordered a 6-12 month costume and it looks like it was made for a 2-3 year old child.Very disappointing on the sizing.Other thoughts:The costume itself is made of thick material so it may be a little warm but strong enough to last.UpdateI ordered a second one from another company but same brand but this time for a new born thinking it would be smaller and it was identical. WTF! Now I have two costumes that i will have to wait until my daughter turns three before she can use. Im P Oed and my daughter doesn't have a costume.
4,so cute,"I purchased this princess leia costume for my very petite two year old that loves everything that her big brother (5) loves. Brother wore a deluxe jedi costume with robe. They were a hit at their preschool halloween parade. The costume itself is very cute and well made. Only complaint: Huge belt(had to cut about ten inches off) and huge headpiece. (had to sew a 3x4 inch dart at the back.) Fleece material a little too hot for southern california, but would be great for those of you who trick o treat in cold weather."
1,Sizing is NOT as advertised!,"This costume looked really cute in the picture, and it said it would fit infants sizes 6-12 months. Well, my daughter is 9 months old and she was swimming in it! The hat literally fit on MY head! This ""baby"" costume would be better suited to a five year old. I will be returning it."
1,"Poor sizing, for all sizes",I purchased two of these for my 9month old (new born and 6-12months) both were identical in size and could fit a 3 year old.The only difference in the two items were the tags marking the size.Dont waste your time it will not fit and seller make you pay to return.
3,Oddly sized,"I like the concept, but $20 is a really high price for a few pieces of felt. I ordered the 6-12 month size for my completely average-sized 9 month old daughter and the robe and the headpiece are really big whereas the belt is far too tight. Be sure to order early and try it on right when you get it so you'll have some time to alter the costume."
4,Too Cute,We put my daughter in this costume for her first halloween. It was adorable. Held up for us perfectly.
3,"So adorable, but still too big","She looked adorable in the costume, but it was huge. I may be able to use it when she turns 1 since it was so big. I had to sew the cap in the back to make the headpiece smaller and make it stay on. The outfit was huge, but the belt made it work. However, I live in south florida and the material was really thick and made her really hot, so I could only leave it on her for a little while."
3,HUGE!!!,"I ordered this item for my daughter who wears 12-18 month clothing. The product is really cute and well made, but she was swimming in it!!!! I had to alter it for her to wear it on Halloween. The head piece fit me (and it does not have elastic or anything to hold it on the childs head. So I had to sew elastic to go around her chin to hold it on)!! So my advice is to order a size down and get out your sewing machine!"
5,lots of fun,"I have a copy of this video and I love it. I love the fact that Rachel is real woman. In the video, she makes mistakes and jokes around with the instructor like she is in a real class. She looks out of breath at times and you can see that she has some fat on her body. I enjoy this video so much more than the ones with anorexic women with smiles plastered on their faces."
4,I cant breathe!! Rachel is a slave driver.,"Rachel is extremely focused and puts out maximum effort thru the entire video. She is not the least bit concerned about her hair or makeup and as far as I can tell it is a real session. Not some contrived peice shot over many days, to obtain some perfect unreachable reality. This video is highly adaptable, to many fitness levels and much more fun than aerobics. Dont delay, buy this video and get going."
3,Slow-learner paced kickboxing,"This is set at the beach with the instructor, Ed Monaghan having many years of martial arts experience & saying this has Muy Tai & another form in it.This is set on a Mexico beach & starts with basic very slow instruction to show you basic core form.The rest of the workout has Ed mostly watching Rachel's form, and only doing the work when showing a new punch, hook, elbow strike, kick, etc.He is great about teaching form & going a certain speed to keep you from getting sloppy and work on your form for balance & safety like a real martial arts student.I took off 2 stars because I don't want to watch Rachel's form, I want to watch the real expert. If he had another where HE was doing the work, I'd buy that.You can see more reviews at videofitness com"
4,Fantastic workout - Great Instructor,I love the Rachel Hunter workout and use this tape regularly. The instructor is terrific and really stresses form - he knows what he is doing 100%. How aerobic you go is up to you - what you put in is what you get out of it!
5,Everyone should read at least one of Frankl's books,"This book and Frankl's other popular book, ""Man's search for meaning"" offer a great deal of overlap. Yet I fond both extrememlty interesting and helpful. Frankl posits that we all have an innate tendency to mental/spiritual health which he calls the will to meaning. This is similar to the body's hedency to heal after any physical assault. He explains that good counselling focusses the will to meaning, or removes blocks which are preventing it from being expressed. Frankl's experiences in a NAZI death camp show how focussing on personal meaning and what little freedom of choice one does have, can enable mental health to survive even under the most pathogenic of circumstances."
2,find better for your money,"This album is a collection of many Sousa Favorites, true; but they are not performed well. I think the Paul Washington Marching Band should have spent a little more time in the studio before leetting this one hit the stores. In every song there are notable blips or cracks by trumpeters, trombonists, piccoloists, or all of the above. In many the feel for time is staggering, as if the musicians decided to each go at their own tempo. Even in that classic favorite 'The Washington Post March', there are major tuning problems.If you want a high quality recording of Sousa marches, buy a better CD.~C~"
1,Not as promised,Had high hope for this product. Have seen little if any results. Directions say rinse thoroughly. When I do this my hair feels like there's no conditioner on it at all & is very hard to comb through. When I rise sparingly my hair combs more easily but my scalp begins itching before the end of the day. So I feel I'm better off with out it.
4,Mesmerising Royalty,"Without being too critical of modern goth rock i can safely say that it is too often unimaginative and lifeless. However not a fan of the genre i cant say how this album would fare in that category but there is a definite dark, gothic side to this album. Scathing, powerful 'big black' -esque riffs are contrasted by frighteningly beautifull melodies. Heavily atmospheric, it sounds like the gloomier sonic youth of old treading paths with the attitude of type o negative. It is worth buying the album just to hear the singers voice as she is one of the best vocalists of the decade. What strikes you first is how emotional and pain striken it is and how she can change between sarcastically sickly sweet angelicness and the occasional scream. The guitars are noisy and the drumming is heavily atmospheric. This is a gorgeous album, but frightening. Dont expect thoughts of love happiness and serenity after listening to Taxidermy."
3,A Question,"I haven't gotton this album yet, but I really want too. Dose anyone know where you can hear clips of this music? Sorry for leaving a question and not a review."
3,Daily Life Depicted in the CSM,"This volume is worth the price for any Cantigas de Santa Maria enthusiast simply for the color plates (although many of these are repeats of those presented in the 1984 book by Keller and Kincade, Iconography in Medieval Spanish Literature). The index, a logically categorized list of specific aspects of daily life in the miniatures, is very thorough indeed and should be extremely useful for further research in Cantigas iconography. The short discussions about each general category do not delve very deeply, and are again only useful as a springboard for further research. Though the written content is not what I would have exopected, for those of us who do not have regular access to the facsimiles, this book is a major blessing."
5,Perfect Watch,"Liked it so much after owning the black one for 2 years, I bought the white one! Only way it could be better is if the alarm functioned better and it didn't need replacement batteries."
4,"Shows its age, but still a very good book","Birders have rather ignored this book, particularly since the publication of _Shorebirds_ and, now, Denis Paulson's new photographic guide. The identification information here is decidedly out of date, and many plumages go entirely undescribed, but Johnsgard's book is still a prime source for information on the range and, particularly, the behavior of many of the waders of the world. The illustrations are of variable quality; beware, too, the misidentifications of some of the photographs. But all in all highly recommended for the shorebird enthusiast, and to be had at a very reasonable price."
3,"3,5 stars","A nice effort by Porcupine Tree but definitely not one of their best albums. With a few exceptions especially with the amazing song Even less and some good songs like : Tinto bass + Piano Lessons, THe other songs are too average or even bad i can say. This is for really huge fans of Porcupione tree or compilators. If you are new start with Signify."
4,Everything was terrific,"As far as Amazon goes, the CD shipped in about three days, and was in perfect condition, so five stars there.As an extra note, the album itself is incredible, one of the greatest examples of prog in modern times.The bonus disc is nice too, however I don't know how necessary it really is. If you can find the regular one for a much cheaper price, just go with that."
4,moronic thoughts to go with stupid dreams,The album is on par with their earlier works which to me makes it a worth while investment. The DVD is somewhat of a mystery as to why they went through all the trouble to include as its content is lacking.
4,Greatest Music - Artwork Lacking,"I love these CDs. I have the original and the music sounds even better in 5.1, plus the extra material makes it worth buying, and of course Porcupine Tree are the best band on the planet right now. Unfortunately though, I didn't find the artwork and packaging to be quite as high caliber as the original. The artwork was printed on rough paper on this new release whereas the original was printed on nice glossy stock which makes the detail much clearer. I had read about the new improved artwork on their web site and I don't know if I agree with Steve Wilson's choice. However, the new artwork is interesting. I just wish that it was clearer. So I am giving four stars for the excellent music and extras - minus one star for the poor reproduction of the artwork. Looking forward to their first live concert DVD release this fall, Arriving Somewhere.... I saw them in concert last October (the same show) and they were awesome."
4,BUYER BEWARE!,"This is a good album. I would place it right behind the last three albums. However, if you don't have any prior experience with DVDA, don't get too excited about the second disc. It won't play on either of my DVD players or my computer. I would love to hear the extended version of Even Less, but I'm not going to replace my entire audio system and/or computer for the experience. If you don't have this album yet, you should definitely buy this, if only to get the original album (remastered) on the first disc. But don't re-purchase it for the bonus material unless you're sure that you have the technology to enjoy it."
4,"very good, even better things to come","This is one of the ""transitional"" albums between the psychedelic PT and the current PT sound, which I don't think can be easily categorized, besides calling it, rock, with metal, acoustic, and electronica elements.I want to call the attention of potential buyers of the double disc special edition. The second disc has a 5.1 mix and a high resolution stereo mix that can only be played with a dvd-a capable player. Only the dvd-video portion (Piano Lessons video, and some pictures) can be played on regular dvd players. When I finally get around buying a dvd-a capable player, this will be one of the first dvd's to spin."
5,Worth the Purchase Price,"One of the best PT albums they've released. This is a very different album from Deadwing in that it does not contain the radio-esque hits of ""Shallow"" and ""Halo"". However, every track is very well thought out and creative.....PT is always great for using space in their music to create atmosphere.Best Tracks:Piano LessonsSlave Called ShiverA Smart KidBaby in CelophaneTinto BrassPure NarcoticThe 5.1 disc is a real treat too, great bonus."
4,excellent,"As you can tell by all the other reviews, England's Porcupine Tree are a bit difficult to describe. Are they psychedelia? Progressive rock? Pop? A little of all of those, actually. Up until now they've been content to seamlessly mix elements of every era of Pink Floyd (Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, post-Waters) with electronic touches, but this is the first album where extended instrumental passages and trippy ambience take a backseat to actual songs. And what songs they are: ""This is No Rehearsal,"" ""Even Less"" and ""Piano Lessons"" are right up there with the best rock songs of '99, or even the '90s in general. Hardcore prog fans seem to be crying ""sellout"" due to leader Steven Wilson's increased interest in song structure, but don't let them put you off - Stupid Dream is a gem."
5,stupid review,Good material is tastefully remixed into surround. DTS surround or MLP makes this sound sweet. The redbook CD is also enclosed and care has been taken to make it sound as good as redbook can. Recommended to fans and newbies alike.
3,Ltd.,"This is one of the few Porcupine Tree recordings that holds much interest. This is decent prog-pop. Strong production. Solid rhythm section. Clever melodies. Suitable voice. Weak soloing. The best song is the instrumental Tonto Brass where an atypical use of flute and sax takes place with some nice passages. Steve Wilson has some talent and potential but he is in sore need of some serious woodshedding. He should take a page from Roine Stolt's book, disappear for a while, work on his guitar playing and make a return. Otherwise his work will be doomed to being that of the red-headed stepcousin to Radio Head and NIN (sans psychosis). Not essential. Look to the Flower Kings instead...Simon"
5,One of my favorite cookbooks!,"Sadly I lost track of this cookbook long ago and was delighted to find a used copy via Amazon. Recipes are simple and healthy but don't taste like ""diet"" food. I use it at least once a week!"
3,Which songs are on the album?,"I'm an avid Kenny G fan but none of the ""sample songs"" are the ones listed. I would really like to hear Songbird, etc. The tracks I heard are just ok but Hey, what is really on the album?"
5,more than thrilled!,I can't even come close to expressing how great it is to find this book. I've heard of this book all my life. I'd even found it on line. It's not the same as having one to hold in your hands and study. In this age I can access a book about my family history. I never dreamed this could be. Thank You!
3,very flimzey but beautiful,I LOVE TO DO PUZZLES BUT THIS BRAND WAS REALLY HARD TO WORK WITH YOU HAD TO BE GENTAL AT ALL TIMES SOO OTHER PEICES WOULDN'T FALL APART. OTHER THAN IT CONSTANTLY BREAKING APART THE END RESULT IS A GORGEOUS PICTURE.
3,Sigrid in her last with a major star,"Why on earth did they make this film??? It`s rather short on entertainment value u c - dear reader. However; as a study of mileue and character it survives.. if only just.... Some scenes with John and Sigrid(they did have an affair hehehe)are potent indeed, but they could have made so much MOOOOOOOOORE of it... It`s sad really...."
4,Wishing there was more!,"It seems like a long wait, but this recording of the swingin' herd has been worth it. Most of the stuff from Jazz Hoot is listenable (noted exceptions are ""bloopsi"" and ""sidewinder"") but the real thrill is listening to the 60's band in CD quality at what was certainly one of Woody's best live recordings. All of the musicians sound great and are right on top of the game as is demonstrated by the enthusiastic reception from the live audience at Basin Street West. You won't find a tune that swings as hard as ""Opus de Funk"" or ""Woody's Whistle"" and Sal Nestico's hard driving tenor solo on ""Northwest Passage"" is absolutly stunning. Now, if only someone would make a release of all of Woody's Phillips material from the early 60's!!!"
1,WON'T charge an Olympus 770SW - Beware,"Despite the title which states that this will charge a 770SW, I ordered this item and it WILL NOT. I got a charger that listed a different battery model than what the 770 has (40B vs 42B) and would not charge my battery.I contacted the seller through Amazon and after 3 weeks have still received no response, not even an email.I wasted my money - DON'T waste yours here."
5,Great Christmas Memories,Received promptly and was happy to have this classic to add to my Christmas CD collection.
4,classic,"its a classic, gave it as a gift to others (they asked someone to get it for them) & they really liked it"
3,Discouraged.,"Except for Whiote Christmas, it sounded pretty much likt the other one, I think I willl enjoy playing it next year."
5,Loved!!!,"I love this CD. It's just another classic. I will always love older music, mostly because it has soul behind it. This CD is a must have for any Christmas lover/music person."
5,Christmas with Bing!!!,"Bing Crosby, as one reviewer has written is Mr. Christmas. Ever since I was 7, listening to the LP of my Grandmothers, and now I'm 24, I've enjoyed Mr. Crosby's voice. Listening to White Christmas puts me into the holiday mood.All of the songs, Bing gives a reverance to each track:Adeste Fideles, always gives me a warm feeling as Bing sings each line. Faith Of Our Fathers, God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman, also gives that reverence of Faith and Joy.My all time favorite, Christmas In Killareny, a nice Irish Christmas tune, very upbeat and happy, makes me think of the early 1930's when Bing sang this, if only Christmas where like this...And in this year, after all that has happened, Bing's songs have a new meaning, and joy and hope that we look to....Merry Christmas all!!!!"
5,My Holiday Favorite!,"Out of the dozens of Christmas CD's I own, this is my ultimate favorite. Bing is the Best. This always gets me in the holiday spirit."
5,Love Bing Crosby,"If you like traditional christmas music, then Bing Crosby is the way to go. I love listening to his music while doing anything around the house, but it sets a very relaxing tone to whatever I am doing."
3,holiday music,good staple to have for xmas time - songs are a little crackly due to the recording but good background music for the time period...
3,CD,"When purchasing this product, I was under the impression that it was a record. I was trying to give my mom some records to use in our new record player. When receiving the CD I was disappointed. It might have been a flaw on my part and just not reading correctly or in enough detail, but had searched for Vinyl records and ended up with a CD. However, the CD was in great condition and is nice to have."
5,True Holiday Charm,"What can I say- Bing Crosby is a legend. His voice makes me jump into the Holiday Spirit. It's an enjoyable, beautiful written and sung Christmas CD. Whether you are young or old his songs will touch a sentimental part of your heart. A must have for your Holiday Music collection. Enjoy White Christmas with your family & friends as the holidays quickly approach. *** Happy Holidays !! ***"
4,Name Change,"For general information, this album (according to allmusic.com originally released - probably as 78 rpm disks - in 1949) was originally titled ""Merry Christmas."" The record I have (pressed somewhere near 1964 by the advertisements on the inner sleeve) is listed as Decca DL 8128.This is a good record. The main oddity is the inclusion of ""Faith of Our Fathers,"" an old-line Catholic, non-Christmas hymn. I never have enjoyed ""Mele Kalikimaka."" Bing was in his best voice, and the numbers with the Andrews Sisters are excellent examples of 40s swing. The album probably doesn't say much to modern listeners, being unabashedly religious, but represents a true Christmas classic from an earlier generation."
3,"Same Old, Same Old","This is just a reissue of the old MERRY CHRISTMAS album that was available since the mid-50s. The title's been changed, but the playing order is the same and the incorrect versions of two of Bing's Christmas hits are the same. ""Silent Night"" was a hit in 1935, yet its a much later recording that appears here. ""White Christmas"" first charted in 1942, yet the version here is the 1947 re-recording. ""Faith of Our Fathers"" isn't even a Christmas song! There's a better, 44-track collection of Bing's Christmas recordings for Decca that includes the correct versions of the hits as well as the remakes and excludes ""Faith of Our Fathers."" It's called THE VOICE OF CHRISTMAS and is available here: [...]"
3,As expected to certain degree,"Bought it hoping that it will come with many Christmas songs so that we can play it over and over again during the holidays. However, after I received it and played it, I felt the song selections are limited, the CD does not have as many popular songs as I expected."
2,way too small,"this was not what i expected. I thought they would be larger. if you want to use them, the ideal place would be for holding two zippers together."
3,Tiny and Not TSA Approved,"The picture is very misleading - I was very surprised they were so small. So I thought I might use them for luggage, which was NOT what they were purchased for - but they are NOT TSA approved, so they have sat unused for a year"
2,Tiny Locks,Locks were really tiny. Both key opens both locks. but again they are really small locks. I bought them for a luggage case and storage closet clearly I misunderstood the size.
1,TINY LOCK - THE PICTURE IS MISLEADING,"This is a tiny little luggage lock. The picture is misleading, and the measurement of the shackle (7/16) is false -- it's more like an eighth of an inch. I give it one star, for the bogus ad and wasting my time."
2,Good lock but Title Misleading,"I purchased these locks thinking they were larger than they actually were. The title for the item says it's a 5/8-inch shackle for the model 131T. If you look on the back of the packaging of the 131T model locks, you'll find that they actually have a 3/16-inch shackle which is significantly smaller than what is advertised. Its a good lock if you're looking for something that small, but just be warned that the size in the title is incorrect."
2,size matters,while these locks carry the major brand name they were not what i expected. they are large enough only for use on a brief case or something similar
4,Smaller than you would expect.,"Look at the dimensions closely. I found out after they shipped that they are small like luggage locks. But they're not TSA approved, so you can't even use as a luggage lock on airlines. If you want two keyed-alike locks that are bigger keep browsing down the list.Not a great choice for a locker shackle either.But they lock and unlock as advertised."
3,Nice lock for luggage,"I bought this lock thinking it would be good enough for a bicycle cable, but turns out the lock is really small. Too small for me to fit the cable through the metal U of this lock. I ended up having to buy a bigger master lock, one that is metal all around and that has a longer U bar. This little one from Amazon should be fine for putting on a suitcase I think. It doesn't have a number code for TSA, so not sure if airport security may end up breaking this lock if they needed to do a search. As long as the search is done in front of you when you have the key, that is fine. But if the search is done in a area without you, uh oh......"
2,Not As Big As I thought It Would Be,"This lock is very small and I should have known by the size measurements listed on the description of the item. I desperately needed a lock for the gym and this lock does work, but I don't think it is strong enough to keep people from breaking into the locker and stealing all of my valuables."
3,Cam Jansen,"...this one is about a famous television dog named Poochie and another person who had a dog named Cloudy. The two dogs looked exactly alike because there was ink on Cloudy. The owner of Cloudy switched the two dogs and was making a note that said I'll meet you somewhere and you have to pay me some money to get him back. There's a girl named Cam Jansen in this book. She has a photographic memory. There is also Cam's friend Eric and Eric's twin sisters. They were waiting for an autograph from Poochie. Cam says, ""click"" when she wants to remember something. She was the one who figured out that they were switched. This book is a great book. I think you should read it!"
5,Outstanding.,"Whenever .Ravi Zacharias speaks, God is in the room. Magnificent.. I suggest you read or listen to all of his books. The Spirit of God will fill your empty places, and beckon you to true wonder and peace."
2,"Great video, but DVD not good","I had this on VHS, but the DVD does not play very well. It looked brand new, but the playback was very problematic. I would not recommend buying this on DVD. If you find the VHS or can find it streaming, it is an excellent apologetics film."
5,"Fascinating, intensely absorbing entertainment.","I read ""The Way of the Tiger"" series as a kid... it was one of the most exciting, unbelievably inspiring and moving (!) reading experiences I have had, then or now... and I'm comparing to stuff such as the works of Victor Hugo, Ayn Rand etc."
5,The best expansion pack to date.,"How often have you gotten an ""expansion pack"" only to be rewarded with lackluster efforts from a development team that has simply moved on from the title? Brood War delivers almost an entirely new game for less than the original cost. As expansion packs go, this one is about as close to perfect as I've seen.In addition to ~30 new missions (with each of the three familiar races from StarCraft), you get more multiplayer maps and new units to explore and enjoy (roughly 2 per race). In addition to new units, many existing units have had their abilities enchanced or changed.Like StarCraft, you can jump into multiplayer on Battle.net and play with up to 8 humans/players. You can only use Brood War against other players who have Brood War (sorry! no mixing versions) -- so make sure your friends pick up a copy as well.If you liked StarCraft, there's simply no excuse not to own this."
4,Hybrid CD,"Although this disc is listed as a Windows CD, it is a hybrid disc that will work with both the Windows AND Mac versions of Starcraft. Great expansion set."
4,a very good game,"Starcraft(brood war) may be one of the best stratgy game ever produced.Ususally when stratagy games break the 2 race barrier the units become dull and boring and the originalty drops (cough cough AoEII).The units are original and when u first play it's always fun to build up the easy learned tech ladder,to see what u cna build.The gameplay is great and easy to learn,the recogmend what race u msut start first w/ due to story line purposes,the sotryline is awsome,THE MOVIE SEQUENCES RULE,i have to admit,sum missons can be rather hard,and DO get boring after repitiouse play,but that opens up a whole new sections of the game..multyplayer,this funtion allows u to play,over the internet,agaisnt other players,making rthe game infinitly fun."
5,The Best Game,The original game seemed kinda boring but this expansion offered more maps for the general user. I suggest this game for all players!
4,"GOOD, but..............","I used to like Zerg so much with guardians and hydralisks, yes! But when I played BroodWar, look what happened! When I attacked Terran, those holy goliaths will shoot missiles and man! It seems that the perfect balance they had in StarCraft was blown away... Zerg became too weak 'cause the guardians are meat to corsairs, valkyries, and goliaths! And the devourers are really not too good... they lose to scouts... and also, the Protoss became WAY TOO strong with the corsairs and dark templars.... if you attack the Terran early(like5minutes)with a few dark templars, they'll die~..... also, if the corsairs kill all your overlords, man! YOU'D HATE IT! StarCraft seems to be more balanced 'cause now, it became Zerg<Terran<Protoss>Zerg, but it used to be Zerg>Terran>Protoss>Zerg~! But it's still the best~~!"
5,Best RTS I've ever played,"As with all RTS games, the best value is multiplayer. Brood war also has a good campaign.Unlike some other strategy titles (Warcraft II & Age of Empires), the units for each playable group are extremely different in stats and pictures. Amazingly, the races are balanced. You will, however, eventually find that one suits you better.You can spend years learning the nuances of using the many spellcasters available."
5,--game of the year--,"Starcraft the original is one of the best games around the world today. Starcraft has itself won over 100s of awards throughout the world, by making broodwar it just expanded its collection of awards. The makers at Blizzard added new characters which made the game even better to play. With the Battle.net free connection what can you lose!"
1,nice game,"This game rocks! it is the best game other than half-life's counterstrike game but online this game is really cool and is fun for years if you play online. bottom line,GREAT GAME."
1,More money,"If you bought Starcraft, then you might as well buy this. It adds more balance in some ways, but takes some balance in others. Why do the Protoss get the ability to mind control? With a 200 unit cap, it means that a protoss player on a resource rich map can have 600 units, given that all three sides are played. Then can mind control a peasant and then build another sides buildings and units. As if the Protoss weren't already a bit more powerful than the rest.Still, it does add 15% more units. so instead of 12 different units, you can build 14 units. Also, each side has a way of efficiently eliminating large amounts of aircraft."
2,OK but not OK,StarCraft Brood Wars isn't really a great game. It took me just one game to love it but I got tired of it after about 8 months after I finished playing it. I got this game about 2 years ago.... Buy something more useful or educational.
1,I dont care to much for the expansion,"First of all StarCraft was a great game in my opinion untill the expansion came out. I play protoss and consider myself quite good but the expansion gives the Protoss and Terran some crappy units compared to the Zergs Lurkers! The zerg can get lurkers early in the game. So if your Terran or Protoss and your coming into rush them, you cant possibly win because the lurkers cant be detected unless you have a observer or something that can see burrowed or cloaked units. If your a Zerg player than Im sure you would love the expansion but if your a protoss player, than most of you probably wont care to much for it. Or at least wont be to exited."
1,I don't know what's so special about this game,"Starcraft brood war is basically the same as the original. All that's new is a few new units for each side and three new boring campaigns. First of all, it takes an eternity to build buildings. Big deal if protoss probes can build two buildings at once if each takes 5 minutes to build. Also all the construction units are way to easy to destroy and you have to build about 50 of them to have practically any resources. It takes an eternity to do anything except get your units and buildings destroyed. The only thing good about this game is the graphics are pretty good."
3,Great add on for any Starcraft fan,This exspantion pack increase the defensive and offensive cappablilities of alot of old favorites and adds some new characters to the scene. This is a must for any true hard core Starcraft lovin zerg smashin freak.
5,A must buy for any RTS fans,"The original starcraft revolutionized RTS. This expansion adds 6 units more abilties, lots of other modifications, 3 new campaigns, tons of more maps and add features. I think the best feature about the game is the multiplayer on battle.net.All 3 races are so different but yet so equal in strength. Just a truly superior mutliplayer game and strategy game in general. You do have to have the original to play the expansion though."
5,Brood War,this game is a little better then the first one but the single player was short. if u play on the internet then it will be hard to stay away from the computer.
1,Starcraft: Brood War,"I borrowed Starcraft and Starcraft: Brood War from a friend and the game is the best computer game in the world. What makes it really special is that you can play it on Battle.net. I couldn't stop playing it till I had to give itback. I like how you get to play three different races instead of just one. This really has a lot to do on Battle.net. I usually had chosen Protoss or Terran. I'm not that good with Zerg, though. Anyway, I just ordered them both and I can't wait to get them!"
4,Hmmmm.,"Junior?As ""Lars"" mentions, I too was expecting at least an ""Argo"" as one of their ""originally recorded labels"" for hits such as ""Let Me In"" and ""Music, Music, Music"" on the label if not a ""Rhino"", ""Collectibles"" or the like.I purchased this from the Collectibles web site a few years ago and figured it to be legit, although I questioned the flaws as ""Lars"" states.Nonetheless, the quality is just and the music soulful / R&B; and worthy. If you love the music from this genre, you'll appeciate this as long as you are not expecting any frills with the packaging or any liner notes. It does look homemade.For the Oldies collectors, If you know the major difference between the quality ""Ace"" label and the homemade style of ""Mr. Maestro"" label you'll fully understand."
1,Getto; Don't Bother,"I looked forward to receiving this CD, but unfortunatly it didn't play in any of my CD players. Not to mention that the cover print was a bad copy of a copy of a copy. I've been trying to contact the seller to return for a full refund, but have had not luck or response from them. I've written twice already. In my opinion, I just lost the price of the CD and shipping charges. Good Luck if you take a chance with this company (Magic-Memories). A getto operation. I'd give them ""0"" stars if I could."
3,It is . . . What it is . . . .Love it or Leave it,"Tower of Power is one of the Top ""Show Bands"" of our time. Even as Emilio & ""The Doctor"" show their grey, the energy still radiates at high levels.For that reason, it's difficult to put this band in a studio and have the same experience that comes from one of their shows.Missing is the sweat and gyration of the crowd, smell of stale beer, and trance that comes from ""all that FUNK"".I ""half listen"" to most of the early cuts, and then ""turn up"" the live versions. This CD is worth the price, if only for the classic ""What is Hip?""Thank you Tower of Power"
2,Tower Of Cheese?,"I bought ""The Warner Years"" Tower Of Power CD and loved it. Hearing ""What Is Hip?"" for the first time was like getting hit by a truck full'a funk. I was very disappointed when I listened to ""Soul With A Capital S"" because these songs are nothing like the older T.O.P. recordings. They're weak and cheesy by comparison. I felt silly listening to songs like ""Funk The Dumb Stuff"" because the song was so lame! Bad lyrics, boring song. The bass playing & horns are still good, but the drums are kinda standard and these songs don't get you moving like the jaw-dropping classics on the Warner CD....Obviously the later T.O.P. recordings weren't that great."
2,Does not fit 91 suburban,This product shipped very fast. When i got the product i new instantly that it wasn't the right one. If you have a 91 suburban you now that the year on this had tons of the new stuff and the old stuff. Chevy couldn't decide what to put on this thing. This harness is for a newer body style. 92 and up. It will fit 88 and up on the trucks.
1,Confusing.,"This was a text for Dr. Shaner's course when I took it back at Furman University, and it hasn't improved with age. Still reads as incomprehensible, with a tangled semi-colloquial writing style and real-life examples that never connect with the text. I was never sure whether it was the subject matter that was unclear or Dr. Shaner's inability to convey it. If I didn't know he had written it in English, I'd have assumed it was at least partly translated from the Japanese via Babelfish.In any case, avoid this book. There have to be texts on the subject that do a better job and are more of a pleasure to read."
3,Not for strong chewers,"This did last my pit bulls a few months, but then the puppy was able to chew the top in half. On the bright side I wrote to Planet dog and they are sending me a replacement of a stronger toy( for my aggressive chewer). I like their company, the toys are safe, not made in China and they donate to service dogs."
1,Like Butter,"My 11-month old pit mix's teeth sliced through this toy like butter. If you have a power chewer, stick with the Extreme Kong or Nylabone products. I recently got the Nylabone Ring-Giant and he loves, loves, loves it...to chew and run around with. Just found out about a blue Kong that is supposed to be 25% stronger than ones bought in the store and ordered it...it came in and we'll be testing it out today."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS TUFF BULB,"My dogs don't like this as much as the Tuff Bulb. The treat opening is smaller, and the thickness of the walls of the toy make it really hard for them to chomp on it and break up the treats inside. It sits in the toy box while the Tuff Bulb is out every day! Sorry...cute looking, but not a dog favorite!"
3,smaller than expected,thought this would be the same relative sizing as the large orbee ball on rope -- my 4 month dobe will be able to swallow the large by the time he is 8 months -- sorry i also ordered the medium.
5,"So Far, So Good!","I first saw this toy in a store a few months ago and my first thought was that my 11 month old pit bull mix would destroy it quickly (she is a power chewer, btw). Over the past few months, I have found that toys holding treats work very well for my dog, so a few weeks ago, so I decided to try it. Well, like a previous reviewer stated, I found this toy is more durable than I thought! Not only does my dog work to get treats out of it, she also will play with it empty, which has been the case for her Kong toys. It seems to be flexible enough for her to chew continuously, yet tough enough to stand up to her powerful jaws. In other words, this toy is great as a treat toy and as a chew toy for my dog, justifying its price."
4,excellent set of classic disaster movies,"My wife fights depression by watching disaster movies, and she considers this a very nice edition to her growing collection. I don't think you will be disappointed."
3,"Very ""B"" Movies","For those of us who like ""B"" movies this was a good 6 pack. A couple of the movies were very preachy, but I guess that goes with the times."
3,what I expecterd,It was a good collection for a rainy day I purchased it for one film which I missed the end of on tv
2,Not happy,"Old and not very good B- rating. The visual effects are cheap, not believable. Acting is lousy with a few exceptions."
4,Taming Bi-Polar a Good Read,"I actually haven't had a chance to read it all, but what I have read has been helpful, applicable, and written in a language that is easy to understand. I look forward to reading the rest of it."
2,Not patient-friendly enough...,"As a newly diagnosed patient with bipolar, I ordered this book hoping for some real life insight. This was definitely not the right book.There is an overload of scientific information in this book. I don't care which snyapse relates information to the hippocampus, etc. I just want to know how to fix and it!Not recommended, unless you want a sterile view on a most uncertain disease."
4,parent of bipolar sufferer,Absolutely fabulous reading a huge help for both sufferer of bipolar disorder and their family as we battle to come to grips with this darn disease.
5,Psychology Today: Taming Bipolar Disorder,"I purchased four of these books...one for each of our daughters and myself. All four of us are so grateful to have discovered this comprehensive and reader-friendly help source. One of our daughters has just been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. We've been riding roller-coaster emotions with her. ""Taming Bipolar Disorder"" reveals the complexities involved with the disease, and presents hope through health resources and even provides a nutritional support section.I highly recommend this publication to anyone who has or knows/loves someone with, Bipolar Disorder."
2,Fulton Boat Trailer Guides,"I was extremely disappointed to find out that the 90 deg. angled pieces that mount to the trailer frame are made of Schedule 80 PVC and not aluminum or galvanized steel. The uprights are Schedule 40 PVC and I have no doubt that a year or so in the SC and FL sun will make this system so brittle that it will break under normal use. The bolts, brackets, and spacers are fine. I was away and my son had already received and installed them for me when I returned home or I would have returned them. I see these guides as a very poor investment for the money I paid. No more Duncan for me."
5,Quiet & Reliable,We have had this fan for over a year with absolutely no problems. It is unusually quiet. Because of its design it will fit in small spaces. It moves a considerable amount of air without the noise and size of a box style fan. It's worth the extra money.
5,Super Quiet Fan,We've had this fan since early October & we've had NO problems whatsoever. The price is definately worth every penny.
2,junk,"The remote stopped working about 10 minutes after I got it. Day two, the fan clicked loudly when turning one of the directions. Day four the fan clicks even when not swiveling. I e-mailed customer service and no reply for a month. I just called and had to wait 45 minutes for a rep."
4,Not what I was expecting,"I listened to this album for a long time at a listening station at Tower Records. I was expecting to hear a bunch of moaning and such but was instead pleasantly surprised to hear a great ""smooth jazz"" sounding album. I would call it a mix of ""lite-jazz"" with a little bit of ""Enigma"" thrown in but without all his annoying yelling. It is more edgy, I think, than just a typical smooth jazz album. The rythms are very cool and I would consider them along the lines of groove. I didn't hear any talking and such but I only listened to about half of each song. Various instruments like keyboard and guitar lay out cool, darker sounding melodies. This kind of music is not what I'd expect to hear with a title like that and I will be embarrased bring it up to the counter but I think it'll be worth it."
4,Great book for any one entering the wedding photograpy.,"This book cover's everthing from what you need to expect for equiptment, pricing, sales, poses, insurance. A good all around book for the aspiring wedding photographer."
1,The quality says it all,"Unless you are an absolute beginner there is nothing here making you a better photographer. Mediocre photos all over the book, Save your money, don't buy this book!"
5,Steve Sints wedding book is excellent!,"I highly recommend Steve Sints wedding book. I have been a photographer since the mid-70's but have never photographed a wedding. When I reluctently agreed to photograph my nieces wedding I sought out advice of fellow professionals. Many pointed to Sints book as a good starting place.I bought the book expecting to end up with more questions than answers. But after reading it I know I had found all the information I needed in one book. The book explains everything about the process of photographing a wedding. There are photo lists, equipment advice, pricing information, and most importantly, dealing with the various problems that can occur. If you have never photographed a wedding before or if you are an old pro you can learn from this book."
4,Great book for beginning or experienced wedding photogs.,"This book is a great resource for both the beginning and the experienced wedding photographer. There's a ton of information on basic posing (including some photographs to show you just how it's done) and lighting which will come in handy to the beginning photographer. There's also a lot of insightful information about trends in the industry and the business end of the job that the more established photographer can learn from. I've been photographing weddings for 8 years and this book provided me with information and ideas that I've been able to implement in my own business. Kudos to Steve for another well written, amazingly useful-in-real-life book."
5,Very good book,"I thought this was a very good book. I would have to say it covered EVERYTHING you would need to know about wedding photography. I've viewed Denis Reggie tapes, visit wedding photography forums daily, and talked to a few wedding photographers and this book is just as good as everything I've learned everywhere else. You can not go wrong with this one.Please don't take my praise as to say it is the only book anyone would ever need, because like anything else, you should get information from many different sources. Make sure to make this one as part of your education."
4,Best Ponce Intermezzo,"The Ponce Intermezzo is the most tender and emotional of other interpretations around. And the Moleiro Joropo performance is just great fun. I couldn't find another cut that was very interesting, but those two are worth buying the CD. Marchena has a great heart."
2,Make sure your kit has ALL the parts,"The kit itself SHOULD come with 5 major parts: the antenna, the splash proof housing, the fm modulator, the mounting bracket AND THE SINGLE LEAD SKIFI CRADLE. I have found that many dealers selling this kit (at a discount) are selling kits that don't include the CRADLE and they don't even know it. IF your going to buy this kit, make sure it comes with the CRADLE!!!"
4,A book that everyone interested in California History should,"A good basic book in California history. An outstanding collection of maps of maps tracing the routes of early Spanish and Mexican explorers, early Indian wars, the Bear Flag revolt, and other items of interest to California historians."
1,Ridiculous Title,"How can anything this guy does be titled ""Best of""? Me thinks it would have been better to title it ""WORST of"". This guy just plain sucks! Can I say that? I sure hope so cause I'd hate to see anyone waste their money on this crap. You'll get more musical enjoyment from the sounds of three hungry cats."
1,Tone Deaf,"Much hype has surrounded G Love & Special Sauce. Don't believe the hype. The instruments are muddled. The tone-deaf singing and stupid lyrics are uninspired. G Love should leave blues music to real artists. If you want to hear talented musicians, spend your money on Jason Mraz or Jack Johson, or Red Hot Chili Peppers Californication"
2,"Needs a ceramic, not wood base","I used this brush for years (starting with the ""Rachel"" years of ""Friends""). But now we have brushes with ceramic bases, so hairstyles last much longer. Wish Spornette would make one."
4,Is Trance becoming a dirty word??,"I've seen the word trance so often lately that it must mean that the end is nigh...or maybe we just need to pigeonhole things ?? This is another excellent addition to this outstanding series. Whoever is in charge seems to know how to pick the DJs when they are at the peak of their powers. Dave Seaman has chosen a bunch of songs and woven them together into a great couple of discs. You can really get lost in here.Outstanding new tracks by Gloat and Meeker as well as a whole bunch of others will keep you grooving as you work, rest or play."
5,EP,"I am a huge supporter of Otep's music! If you're like me, than you can't go wrong with OWNing a copy of their EP! Tribe love and respect."
1,Let me explain my rating...,"before i verbally dessimate this album, i would like to state that i thuroughly enjoyed Otep's first album ""Sevas Tra."" however, i feel that losing a couple of band members and changing the music style in the way they did compromised the message front-lady Otep established in the band's breakthrough to mainstream ears. instead of praising creativity and freedom, the lyrical content is spent on assaulting the war (which i am also anti-war). i miss the groove heavy days that made Otep original. but if you like your music relentless, heavy and brutal (which i do) AND political, this is for you. i just never thought politics was artistic. art could not save this album for me."
5,"Fresh, ragging sound","Who said girls coudn't growl??? This band performed on Ozzfest this summer in the side stage, the thing that makes this band interesting and worth of attention is their lead singer, which is a girl who can rap and growl with a great power. The songs sound fresh and the disctintive touch of the voice of their vocalist, makes them unique.Enough said. GO GET THIS CD AND CATCH THEM LIVE WHENEVER YOU CAN"
2,Not Very good,"Well, I saw Otep at Ozzfest and I Must say that they are not good. There is no other way to say it. The singer is just a female who tries to sound like a male but fails miserably. No offense to females but I have yet to hear a female-led metal band who is good. Otep is just another Kittie wannabe band and Kittie isn't good either. So if you like Kittie then you will probably like Otep, but if you are like me then you need to go listen to listenable metal. If you want some underground metal go listen to No One, Crossbreed, Superheist or Adema, not Otep."
2,"Very thin, poor quality","I had another (store) brand of self sealing envelopes before these and assumed these Mead envelopes would be the same. I was wrong. These are made of thiner paper making it feel cheaper and making me concerned whether the seams would hold when more than a couple pages were inserted. Also, many of the envelopes were crinkled up in the corners already. I don't know if this is a manufacturing defect or damage from shipping. But I was disappointed. Only reason they are getting 2 stars are the price (cheap, but you get what you pay for) and the self adhesive strips work well."
3,Too Thin...,"These envelopes are alright for enveloping papers. However, they are very thin and you can see the text on papers through the envelope."
2,Corners do not seal!,"So it is obviously better then licking envelopes all day.The problem with this one is that the ""press-it seal-it"" does not go all the way to corners, and tends to leave them sticking up.I had to tape the corners down."
1,Very flimsy and see -though,"These envelopes are made from very thin paper. You can easily read printed text through the paper. The envelopes are also folded differently than standard envelopes and the sides of the opening stick up when more than a couple sheets of paper are put inside, making it difficult to seal."
2,cheap quality,I thought Mead meant quality. I dont feel confident sending 3 or more pages in these envelops.
3,It OK,"Nothing fancy just an envelope, not thing and not too thin, just ok. I mean wasn't expecting too much from an envelope"
3,good enough,good enough for everyday mailing..not the best quality but the price is too good to pass up for this size envelope..It does the job..what more can you ask?
1,Not printer friendly at all!,"Not a bad envelope, but as has been mentioned previously, the paper is so thin you can read text thru it.My biggest gripe is that I got these with the intention of using them with my HP J6480 AIO printer. Three paper jams and one driver reload later, I figured out that I had made a bad choice.The paper of which these are made is very, very thin and light (not like bond) and the texture is a bit slick and plastic feeling. They do NOT feed well in to the printer. They are so slick and thin that the rollers can't grip it.Lesson learned. For non-printer, low security every day use they would be OK.Just don't let them near a printer. Get good heavy bond type paper envelopes."
2,"Flimsy, flimsy paper!","Yes - those negative reviews are spot on! These envelopes are made of regular printer paper, folded into an envelope. I never thought envelopes could be made like this - unless you buy them from a market stall. Please, fellow country-folk, hearken the nay-sayers and do not buy these!"
2,"Not as pictured, very thin & no privacy","What you get is NOT what is pictured at all! First of all, you get a blue box, not the red one. Secondly, this is just a standard, thin envelope, without the printed lining for privacy you would normally see or like to have. I didn't realize until after I got it that there's another totally different kind of envelope out there. The adhesive is fine and good, I suggest not getting any envelopes without adhesives nowadays because they're just better & easier.If you're looking for better quality and privacy, you need to get theMead #10 Security Envelopes, 40 Count (75214). I don't know why it's only 40 count and not 50 for the same price, but this is the kind of envelope you would want to get."
2,Disappointed...,"This would be a great product if it were only a little larger. I wear a 34D or 36C, and the brababy is just too small for my bras. 2 of my bras have been dented after washing them with the brababy, which this product was supposed to prevent. I followed all the instructions, even trying it without the inner ""egg"" as recommended, but it still resulted in damage. Maybe those with smaller cup sizes will have better luck."
1,Buyer Beware,"Great concept-horrible in reality. Just as the other reviewers have written, the BraBaby clasp broke and ruined my $50 bra. Do not buy!!!!!"
1,Broke With First Use,Broke With First Use!!!!!Brababy clasp broke in the washing machine and the inner ball came out.We never found the clasp. Apparently our washing machine ate it up anddestroyed my expensive bra!!
2,Fine unless the input power is flaky,"I've had 2 problems with this adapter:1. If you use this with a less stable power supply (e.g. a generator) that's not load-balanced, it likely will fail - I've blown out 3 of these under such conditions and the GNX 3000 I use it with doesn't run on batteries and there's no protection circuitry in either. Note that other power supplies with other effects pedals on the same circuit did not fail and were fine. There's no fuse in either the GNX 3000 or the power supply system (which would be a nice cost-saving measure), so you're stuck with replacing the power supply. I recommend keeping a spare on hand.2. the wire/ wire support on the low voltage side isn't very good. If you transport it around and use it a lot, the wire will break eventually so treat it carefully.So, compared to other power supplies on other electronics, it's inferior, but it's the only choice you have."
3,Substitute,"i had to buy this again because the original cord got trimmed. May be it was because of the use, but i think the design is not adequate and continue failing."
5,best direct replacement for a gnx4,best direct replacement for your gnx4 same as factory half the price digitech will charge you for the same product very pleased
5,Helpfull product,"I am able to keep my gel polish on for much longer now that I start with the Bond Aid. I went and had my nails done and asked the manicurist what she was applying, she told me and I immediately ordered it. I almost aways do my own at home, but I was out of town so I had to pay to get them done, I am very glad I did now."
5,love this stuff - so happy to find it,This product was recommended and sold by my first dentist and took very good care of my tooth sensitivity problem. My second dentist didn't have it and I have been trying what they sold to no avail. My teeth are very sensitive to cold and sweets now that I have been off of Gel Kam for too long. Just started using it again and I can already feel a difference in my tooth sensitivity. Very happy to be able to but this product again without having to have a dentist's perscription or permission.
5,Gel Kam,Product arrived in timely fashion. No problems with the seller or the item. Very hard to find item that has been recommended to me.
3,quality product/very limited return policy,"I was very pleased with the quality and look of the leather tote when I received it. What I did not know when I purchased it was that they absolutely would not take the tote back after 30 days. The slip said they would send it back to you if you tried to send it to them. This would not have been a problem if it had been for me, but I purchased it in November as a Christmas gift. It would have been impossible to give the recipient the option of returning it or exchanging it. In addition, if you return it within a 30 day period they still charge you a restocking fee for sending it back. Internet purchases are tricky because you don't see the product in person, so a very restricted return policy makes it very unlikely for me to purchase from this company again."
3,Has promise,"I want to like this book and maybe by the time I finish it, I'll change my rating. I would have finished it yesterday, but 2 things stood in the way. The writing in the opening pages is choppy in an annoying way that could easily be fixed. By the time it smooths out you get to page 24 and the publisher makes you crazy. The print size changes on some lines. It made my eyes nuts. I finally measured it and found it varies from 1/8"" to 1/16"" either in heighth or width or both. It's not just page 24; a very speedy scan caught pg. 62 where the font varied within the sentence as well as from one line to the next. I may need new glasses, but that isn't the problem. I read about 6 or 7 books a month and this is the only book with the problem. I suspect the story is good. I'll pick it up again."
4,Medieval Lives,"An enjoyable read with a lot of facts not given in high school history. Mr. Jones is a noted ""Middle Ages"" scholar and his writing is easy to follow and insightful. He shattered a lot of my preconceived notions. I find the Medieval times fascinating, this adds to my enjoyment."
5,Great Book!,"For the beginning reef tank enthusiast this has been a great book. All the information you need to know is well presented, easy to understand. The size and layout enable the reader to look up information quickly. Lots of illustrations and great index to species and their care requirements.I highly recommend this book."
5,Great first book for corals,"This book does what it sets out to do, it covers the basics of coral care and propagation. It has valuable advice on which corals to keep and which to avoid. The book is by no means exhaustive, but will provide a great starting point."
3,Not for Divers but Good for Aquarium Keepers,"Reviewed for web site:- whats that fish.Not a book for divers, as is very limited on pictures, so no good for identifying while under the water!OK for the first time aquarium hobbyist for the basics on corals. Not many photo's!"
3,Good for Aquarium Hobbyist - Not for Divers,Reviewed for web site:- whats that fishNot enough pictures!No good for identifying corals underwater in the sea! - great for aquarium hobbyist.
1,Look somewhere else!,"first off, this kit is absolute garbage. Second, all the parts/tools are from the 99cent discount store. Can't tell you how upset I was when I open the box and see all the bs that was inside. I honestly flipped out, couldn't believe what I was looking at. So do yourself a favor and visit your local RadioShack, I bought a similar kit for $40 less. Its not the greatest, but its a 100 times better than this kit."
3,ALMOST wide enough!,"I bought these to put some horse pills I have to take. They ALMOST fit! I ended up splitting the pills and wrapping them in tissue paper and putting them in the cases. The Inside Diameter of the case (without the little insert) is .402 inches or 10.23mm. If your pill is even a LITTLE larger than that, look for something else. Other than that - for the $$ - these are great!"
3,okay,nicely made and good design. Unfortunately it is too small for most of our medications. I am sure we will still use them.
3,pretty cool,"really does hold money, but i wouldn't put a $50 or $100 in these - that would guarantee i'd loose them."
2,Not as shown,Ordered these items because of the 6 colors. I got 2 red and 4 silver in a padded envelope. They seem like leftovers to me. I would return them but it's not worth my time or effort. Very disappointed.
2,cheaply made but works adequately,"These work at least, but they are not of very high quality manufacturing.I was hoping for something that seemed a little sturdier than what these turned out to be.complaints:The o-rings are low quality and start to dry rot with in a yearThe o-rings are too thin and the capsule isn't machined to properly utilize the o-ringThe result is when you twist the lid on tightly enough the o-ring is shoved out of the gapThe plastic bottle inside the capsule is of very low quality.The threading on the bottle is very coarse and the lid doesn't really stay on welland the lid breaks easily"
4,Urns,These are perfect for holding ashes. I lost a pet and these were perfect. They are extremely solid. They have a tiny little bottle inside and the outer casing has a soft seal that makes it totally airtight and stay closed. I gave the extras to the vet. They were really grateful and plan to start buying them to give to others who lose a pet. Similar products which are designed for ashes are monumentally more expensive. Go for these.
3,"Cute and colorful, but teeny","I bought a set of these prior to a trip. They're made of colorful aluminum, and have a small plastic vile inside to keep what ever is put inside waterproof. Unfortuately these were just too tiny to hold much at all. With the small plastic vile, it might hold one or two baby aspirin, w/o the plastic vile, it might hold two Advil. I had hoped to use one for my medical history, but it was just too small. I can see where this would be great for geocaching though."
5,Geocaching Mania,"The items were exactly as promised, thanks for helping to spread the rage of geocaching!"
4,Silver only ID holders,"Item description says ""Assorted Colors (Red, Blue, Green, Black, Purple & Silver)"" but items only came in silver? Other than that they are as described. No big deal for me, but that is why I gave it a 4 start rather than 5 star rating."
3,too tiny,"I am a noob prepper, not sure what I was going to use these for but they were cheap and cute, and still are. They are just too small to do much with. My daughter said the vial inside the metal container looked like something to hide illegal substances, and indeed I don't know of any pill that would actually fit in there. Can take the vial out and then there is a bit more room in the container, still not sure what it would be good for, besides being pretty. I will update when I figure out what to do with them."
5,Great little products,"Perfect for storing anything small you need to take on the road - They each have a little glass vile inside that makes adding and removing products easy, and the top is slightly magnified to stick to the top, so there is no rattling inside. And the colors are very vibrant! Good for your purse, first aid kit, or anything you take with you on the go."
3,Sufficient,"The keychains are pretty cheap and will hold most pills if you take out the useless small holder inside the keychain. The color is easily scratched off and over time, all of the keychains are silver."
4,bit small,"They are tiny, but still hold a couple pills or geocache log. My nephew loved them so had to give him one."
3,Small Pill Holders,"I could not tell the size of the pill holders. However they are OK for many uses. They are light being plastic and will accommodate small pills easily, but not large ones."
1,Toxic warning!,"The product came with a creepy warning that ""This Product May Contain Substances Known to the State of California to Cause Cancer and/or Reproductive Toxicity."" As a result, I don't want to use this product for storing medications, and I wish Amazon had posted a warning notice with the product description. The purchase was a waste of time and money. I have also uploaded a photo of the warning label."
2,Cheap but so-so,Definitely cheap but you get what you pay for. Looks great when it arrives but one day in your pocket and it looks beat-up. You get what you pay for.
5,so glad i have them,these keychains came just in time to be stocking stuffers for my family and friends. they are very convienent they are really worth the money. i have yet to have noticed a problem with them. loved all the colors. i would reccommend these keychains.
4,a good alternative to save some $$$,"I had no problems with either of the mini tubes however you do have to be careful with tightening because the threading is not perfect. Still though, getting 6 of these for a lower price than 1 good quality one is hard to pass."
5,Excellent little containers,"I found these containers & thought ""There's got to be something cool & crafty I can do with them."" I was right. My ""TBT Carriers"" are selling like hotcakes.The variety of colors is excellent, & the containers are sturdy, lightweight, & work great!Whatever you use them for, I'm sure you'll find they work well."
5,Small Pill holders,"I would like to say the service and the quality of Amazon is nothing but excellent. The pill holders are better than I thought they would be. Compact and convenient the holder slide on your key chain, you always have your keys with you so you will always have your pills with you. This is a great product."
4,Very handy for organizing things,"This is a lot better than depending upon ziplock bags when you're going mobile. A lot of things in my travel bags get banged around and small item fall ot get lost in the bottom. Also, when bags start wearing holes (before you have time to replace them), things"
2,Questionable Quality,"The price was right, but the quality was less than desired. Two of the six tubes had such poor threads that they slip if you tighten them too much."
5,Perfect for my intended purpose,"I bought two packages of these and have given most of them away. Knowing the potential benefit of giving aspirin to someone having a heart attack, and having elderly family members I decided to keep some handy. I also know (first hand) the benefits of giving antihistamine to someone bitten or stung who has an anaphylactic reaction.I took the plastic vial out and pitched it. I wrapped 4 regular aspirin in a single layer of aluminum foil and that fit perfectly in the base, and two individually wrapped Zyrtec fit perfectly in the lid. I put together two of these and put one on each of my key rings. I gave my parents each what they needed to do a kit for their key rings and have given the rest to people who ask what mine is when they see it and remark about it being a good idea.At less than a buck a piece and taking up less room on your ring than a key... why not?"
3,Great Price but..,Pros...Great price and you get a set.Cons...the clear pill capsule doesn't seem large enough for alot of pills today. #2. I like to put money in mine in case I need it or if someone's in a jam and asked for spare change but each one without the pill capsule will hold 1 bill at once so I keep a $5 bill instead of a couple of dollars like I was planning to hold.
2,Small to the point of useless as pill holder,"To give you an idea of scale, you could only fit two old-style Contact cold remedy capsules stacked on top of each other, and that's extending into the cap - inside the raw aluminium shell. The shell is a fairly thin-walled vessle with a mini plastic capped vile inside. I somehow was not expecting this little plastic sleeve that you could probably put 3-4 baby aspirin in it. Pretty much useless for what I need. Unless you are carrying a single small pain killer, sub-lingual nitro, or alternative ""powders"" . This is not something I would recommend to someone who needs an ""emergency kit"" of multiple critical meds. Yes, I know it has the measurements listed in the ad, but I clearly was not able to properly translate how tiny that would be. I'm still sorry I bought these Barbie-sized containers. I need something twice this size."
4,Exactly as Advertised,"Great little keychains! It does take some finesse to get a bill to fit, but once you figure it out, it's easy!!"
4,Very nice for the price,"Mine were all fine. They are tiny, but as other reviewers have stated, the glass tube can be removed to make more room for larger tablets. They are a good buy. The size is perfect with the glass tube for some of my pills, and with the glass tube removed, for others. The colors make recognition easy."
5,Slim profile and a good value.,"I needed to keep just a few small pills on my keychain for emergencies. I'd seen something similar to these at the drugstore but they were bigger and clunkier than what I needed. The colors are pretty, but if you wanted to be more discreet, the silver would blend in with your keys and not be too noticeable. I would have been happy paying this price for one so having six is a bonus!Update: A few months later, I have given away all but one of my extras. Every time someone sees it on my keychain, they want one."
5,Sturdy,Good threads on the main capsule and solid connection to the key-chain loop. I use one for a single American bill and another for a pair of foam earplugs. Can't beat it for the price.
4,"These are great, albeit small.","I was looking for something small enough to be on one's key chain. These are great for that. They seal well and don't unscrew. My husband isn't gentle with his keys, so if they don't unscrew for him, it's a good testimonial. The liner is nice, but he needed to remove it in order for even small pills to fit. Works fine without the liner. A little bigger would be great, but the only bigger one I have found was about 4 times larger making too big to be on a key chain. I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because of limited size. The price was amazing for the set."
4,Talk about disfunctional!,"A wonderful compliation of letters, stories, perceptions and anecdotes of a historical family on both sides of the ocean. Their successes and failures are much like those of current times. The lives of these families during post-WWI and pre-WWII are shared in a comfortable familiar way, which brought me into the folds of the familys. Although slow at times, I thoroughly enjoyed the expeience."
5,Loved It !,"The amazing times in which they lived, their personalities and circles they moved in were told with a knowledge and insight that made me wish it would never end. Excellent reading."
3,Interesting women in interesting times,"Very well researched look at a fascinating era. However, I agree with other reviews. The story got boring at times. Certain historical tangents seemed like the author reminding us that he is a ""serious historian."" I'd like to see an edited version that tightens the story and focuses on relevant details."
4,A Great Sisters Story,"The writing is first rate and the sisters are fascinating and maddening at the same time. Fox tells all about his famous family but to his credit they all emerge with their dignity intact, well done. Packed with great photos but still would liked to have more."
5,Wonderful insight into a fascinating family,"Written by a grandson of one of the Langhorne sisters, this book is a fascinting account of the lives of all five of them as well as members of the next generation, such as Nancy Lancaster and Bobbie Shaw. It is also a good review of the politics of the time and a view of how the two world wars affected the family and England in particular."
1,boring tale about flakey mean people,"I had to quit reading this book approximately half way through because I had no interest whatsoever in continuing to read about these snobby, conceited and dull women. Don't waste your time."
1,batteries were dead,i had to buy new batteries because they all came in dead. then the alarm isnt all that loud. you get better ones at home depot. they cost more but they are alot better.
4,"Old, excellent collection of Reprints","This is one of a series, dating from the early seventies, of Aldine Annuals on biofeedback. Joe Kamiya, one of the first pioneers of biofeedback, and, in my opinion, THE pioneer of EEG biofeedback, edited these collections of wonderful early articles on different aspects of biofeedback, applied psychophysiology, self regulation and awareness.I have a set of these and still find the articles useful for reference. There was a burst of excitement and research back in the late sixties and seventies and these volumes saved them from the dust-heaps of old library stacks.I'd have given it a five star rating, since the quality is great, but we' are talking dated here."
4,Err...,"This guitar was a great value, as it was nice quality for a low price. Not as good as others i've seen, but still a good deal."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE,"THIS IS THE WORST SOUNDING GUITAR IN THE WORLD. I WAS LOOKING FOR A CHEAP GUITAR BECAUSE I WASN'T REALLY SERIOUS IN PLAYING AND I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER. THE AMP IS THE WORST ONE I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE, THE STRAP IS REALLY BAD QUALITY TOO, I PLAYED ON IT FOR 30 MINUTES A DAY FOR A WEEK AND ITS ALREADY FALLING OFF. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FIRST ACT EVER, THE BRAND IS REALLY CHEAP AND IS GARBAGE."
2,MY Future Guitar,"I REALLY want this guitar and i think it would be GREAT for me learning how to play an educational intrument, BUT my mom wont let me ...it STINKS!!!"
2,this thing is bad not in a good way,the problem is I have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite. P.S. has bad sound
1,NOT EVEY GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A TOY,"I AM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS, I NEED TO BUY A GOOD NAME BRAND FOR AN INSTRUMENT. THIS IS POOR QUALITY AND I RETURNED IT VERY DISPLEASED."
4,good enough for a primate,I am a chimp and I am just begining to learn to play the guitar and I believe that this is a great guitar to start with. I recommend this guitar for any parent who is teaching their child to play. The quality of this instrument is fantastic but I also recommend eventually getting a better one later on down the road. I also like poo because it's fun to fling.
5,coool guitar,this guitar is the best my mom is gonna let me get it on my birthday but she syas that i might change my mind but i wnat thsi won cuz it roks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't waste your money,"Was looking forward to getting book on design and info on a witches garden, but instead, full of info that I can find on google, with no design or structor of a garden at all. I actually found more info on google (free) than I did in this book. It is being sent back"
2,Dentist Says This Product is for Really Loose Dentures!,"""Sea Bond"" denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste, gel, or powder, the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist, I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case, the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However, dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, DDS"
1,didn't hold worth a darn,"I had high hopes for this product. It got great reviews everywhere I looked so I bought it. It didn't hold my lower dentures at all. Please don't hold anything against the seller if this review links to them, they did nothing wrong, but I will never buy this product again and I can't even give it away."
5,My Husband Can Smile Again!,My husband had trouble with his dentures making his gums sore and then he discovered Seabond. He was having trouble finding it in our area so when I was able to order it on Amazon he was happy.His gums are no longer sore and his chewing is much better.Thanks Seabond.
1,It was a pain to fit into Urban Wave stroller,"For the price of this item, it was a PITA to put on my stroller. Stretching it to fit into my First Years Urban Wave stroller was not fun. I would not buy this product again. It might fit better for other strollers but not for mine."
1,Waste of money,Out of the three stroller organizers that I purchased I found this one to be useless. Personally I think it pointless. Don't waste your money...
5,A MUST HAVE ITEM!,"If your stroller doensn't come with a parent tray, this is excellent to have! Holds more than I thought it would!"
3,just okay,the parent organizer is just ok - it carry's some things but is not the best organizer but not sure if they could make another one for this type stroller. But I need it and use it - so it works.
3,"It works, just not as great as I'd hoped ...","I have a Bugaboo Chameleon, and needed some extra storage; based on another reviewer [with the same stoller] I decided to purchase this organizer. It works okay... I can store my phone and a bottle of water in it, which is what I wanted. However it restricts a lot of the features of the bugaboo. For example I can only recline the seat 1 setting, I can't swivel the handle (switch forward facing to rear), using the brake is difficult among other functions in that area. All in all it's just okay, not worth returning but not really worth the price either."
4,"Great addition, little pricey.","I thought it was alittle pricey, but glad I bought it. I use it. There are two water bottle/sippy cup holders, one zippered pocket, and two other pockets. I bought for my Joovy Caboose sit and stand stroller."
5,flow,"I would sound so redundant stating CW's vocal skills..absolutely awesome, Love this Real Men Do, because its erotic and CW's vocals are so sensual....he does have an extraordinary gift of delivery..provoking fantasy with his voice and words. Cannot take Flow off repeat..CW is not subtle with FLOW. Yes the remaining tracks are excellent, however, I'm smitten with FLOW!There is no male vocal artist layin it down like this right now and this album is 11yrs old!! Come on Chris... your fans are thirsty for more of your music!"
5,R & B Classic...,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Williams, but I didn't know that he came out with this cd. I ordered this cd strictly off the strength of the comments from Amazon.com customers, and I am soooo glad that I ordered this gem. I cannot believe that this cd flew under the radar. If you didn't know before, this man can sang (oh yes, I said sang)! It seems to me that you can hear some pain in his voice when he's singing, almost like he was going through some things when he recorded this. This cd is absolutely wonderful. Thanks to all of you that reviewed this cd and ""convinced"" me to order it. I am not disappointed at all. :)"
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!,CW's 'Real Men Do' is wonderful his voice is still soulful and beautiful. All CW fans will enjoy this.
3,Bubble Maker,"This bubble maker is simply okay. Since it is a hand-held toy it is easy for kids to tip it sideways when playing with it. This causes the bubble solution to easily pour out and run down the sides, which makes a mess, but the solution can then get into the battery compartment and motor causing the machine not to work. You have to clean it and wait until the whole machine dries out before it will work again. If the machine is held upright it works great and generates lots of bubbles."
1,Definitely not worth the money...,"I purchased one of these for my child. At first a few bubbles came out, but then nothing but a mess. Not what I consider Little Tikes quality. Very disappointed."
4,YUM!,"Just ordered this book and I love it already. In addition to pies, cakes and other goodies, there is even a section with recipes for ice creams! So excited...will probably need to order a treadmill because of this book. :-)"
5,The best of Pacific Moon,"Uttara-kuru is fantastic! The album blends traditional japanese music with cool modern ambient rythms. ""West Wind"" album is also great."
2,Unfortunate-Again,"If you're looking for he skill and talent of the likes of Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya, don't, I repeat-don't look here. While having some interesting elements, East Wind and Prayer are the only Asian albums I have purchased that have woefully dissapointed me. I love eclectic blends of Asian music combined with true talent. Neither East Wind nor Prayer appeal to me as anything close to enjoyable and aren't even in the same category as Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya. Save your $$ unless you enjoy Hip/Hop/Fusion/Asian/Ornamental blends not altogether well executed.I found this album only somewhat more interesting than ""East Wind,"" but still altogether unappealing."
1,"Fine product, but isn't what is pictured on Amazon","I ordered this as a gift for a friend. First, $80? For 1 box of 30 cookies? Seriously? That MUST be a misprint. And the cookies arrived smashed and the bag was roughed up. It did not arrive in that beautiful box that is portrayed in the picture, and the cookies were a 1/4 of the size of those posted. SO disappointed that I feel taken advantage of on this product. They dogs liked them, but I am still annoyed that was was posted is not what I received."
5,Great System!,"I checked out a ton of travel systems in the store and this is the one I LOVE and purchased for myself. This one is incredibly easy to fold down, and way easier than others to fold back up. The infant seat sits securely with two clips on the bottom so it cannot tip. The pattern is also very attractive."
5,Love It,"I just love this travel system, love the color, style, and handling. I have been using it for almost five months now. I like the hidden compartment under the clock, I usually put my keys there. The basket underneath the seat holds my really big diaper bag. I call the stroller the Cadillac of strollers. The steering of it is so easy, folding and opening I can do one handed. I like the one handed levers to lower or raise the seat and basket. The stroller does great on not so well maintained country roads. My son likes just sitting in the stroller because he can sit up and see all that is going on. The stroller is a little heavy but I never have problems lifting it over the rear gate of our Aztec. Attaching the carrier to the stroller is very easy. Really like the locking mechanisms holding down the front of the carrier on the stroller. Putting my son into the carrier is so easy, only time he fusses about it is when he wants to be held and not be in the seat. I highly recommend this system."
5,Love it!!! But its a little bit heavy,"I love this travel system. It's easy to use, easy to fold, easy to unfold, cute, soft, and it looks great! However it is heavy when folded up to pick up. But overall its great"
5,wow,"Unlike the other books where the concentration camps are well known and they are all the same story, this one is uniqe. Instead of gas chambers and crematoriums the people in Bershad were starved to death and near liberation, they were shot. even after liberation the book is exciting and heartbreaking. do not leave it sitting on the shelves."
5,"Fun, delicious and nutritious!","These are great for my son as a snack, but as a mom - I love them too!"
5,I Like This Side of Philippe,"Philippe shines in this accoustic release, especially with his interpretations of ""Naturally"", ""Summer Breeze"", and ""I'm Not in Love"". Nineka Morton provides nice vocals on ""Once"" and ""About Time"". My favorite tune is ""La Valse Des Lilas"" and you just cannot help but tap your feet and get that neck action going! If you are a fan of Philippe Saisse, you must get this one!"
5,Great Suspenseful Reading,"I found ""The Last Star"" to be one of the best books I have ever read in the realm of Christian fiction. It seemed to provide just the right amounts of suspense and credibility. The technical descriptions surrounding the unusual star phenomena were very believable without being overbearing. As a reader who normally likes authors such as Clancy and Ludlum, I was delightfully surprised to find such a suspenseful and riveting novel written in a Christian venue. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I do hope that there will be more novels by William Proctor to follow!"
5,"Thank you, Mr. Rogers!","This is a wonderful collection of two DVDs from the Mister Roger's treasury of episodes. In fact, you buy one and get one free. Both are wonderful DVDs and I wish more was available out there for our kids. Let's just hope that the vaults with Mister Rogers's Neighborhood episodes from years back can be opened and released on DVD."
3,"it wasn't what I hoped, but it was interesting","this was an interesting book, but it really only scratched the surface of the issue of porn. It's a quick, light read."
3,A tough read,Ok this book was not an easy read. It was stories of pornstars and their life outside of what you see on TV. If you have never heard of Craig Gross you might want to go to the XXXchurch website so you can get a feal of what he is all about. I hope he continues to write.
4,For busy people who love their dogs,I bought this book right before I started a full time job. It provided useful advice on how to care for my dog and still have a life of my own. I loved this book!
2,Nothing I Didn't Already Know,"This book was not all that helpful to me. I needed some ideas to balance my busy life/job with my new dog. It is a nice looking book with some cute dog pictures. It provides some basic information for how to care for a dog, not really geared towards busy people."
2,Dissapointed,"This book was a dissapointment. If you have never owned a dog, it might be ok. I was expecting a little more on training. There wasn't even a section that really went into any detail on housetraining."
3,Ann Nesby 's Voice,"I have always enjoyed the richness of her voice. She reminds me of Mahalia Jackson. When they sing , they own the song. If she had better song selection, this lady would own the airways. I will continue to listen to songs on the albulm that I enjoy on the album."
2,scottishterrier,"The stones are quite nice but the bracelet is too tight. It needs at least one more stone to fit my wrist and I have a small wrist - about 6-3/4"". It is too tight to wear comfortably. The colors of the stones are bright - just like in the pictures. Please add one or two more stones."
1,Window handle,I bought this door handle for my daughter's Honda Civic and only lasted for a week. The treads in the handle where attaches to the door came smooth so quickly. It was not strong enough to overcome the pressure when you winding up the window. I will not recommend this handle for any one. It is waste of the money.
1,Do not buy this movie,This edited version has been cut up so bad that it doesn't even make sense. Look for the original version and get that. This one should be removed from the shelves for good.
1,DON'T BUY,this is the worst thing that could have been done. Take a 5 day mini-series and chop it to under 2 hours. You loose everything. Save up and buy the full 4 tape version... It is worth it...
2,"Tweak the hook mounts and get rid of the smell, then it's okay","My initial impression wasn't great. Upon initial assembly the two outer hooks slipped right through the holes that were supposed to hold them, but a few minutes with some strong pliers fixed that. But then there's the smell. I don't want expensive wool suits smelling like new vinyl so I aired the bag out with fans for a few days, along with an occasional spray of Lysol or Febreze to help. Once that was done, it's pretty much what you expect: a vinyl dust cover.It's transparent, which is nice, and it's easy enough to get into. Fortunately it's inexpensive, too. I doubt it would hold up under daily use, but for storing things you only access occasionally it's good enough."
2,I Is For Inappropriate For Younger Readers,"This book is unsuitable for 4-year olds even though the description says this is for 4 to 8 year old children. The Search Inside does not display the entire page and cuts off the sidebar which is very wordy and full of some interesting and some not so interesting facts, depending on the alphabet letter.I did not feel that some of the featured items were appropriate either. For example:I is for Ishiwho awoke one morning to findof all the Yashi tribe in all the worldhe was the last of his kind"
2,OK book,"Purchased from amazon to help with a class I'm teaching. Not a good book for the student or teacher, it would look good on the coffee table. This should be made clear in the description"
4,I thought the product worked very well and ...,I thought the product worked very well and already told my neighbor about it. It stayed much better than a different brand I've been using. I've already made the switch!
4,"If you absolutely, positively want to be 100% ...","If you absolutely, positively want to be 100% certain your teeth don't fall out, this is the product to use. I've used adhesive powders and there's quite a difference between the powders and Fixodent. With the powders I can detect some movement, and didn't have one-half as much confidence as I did using the Fixodent. The only thing I didn't like, and the reason I give the product a four-star rating instead of a five, is that the glue's a little hard to remove. But it's a small price to pay if you want to be sure your teeth aren't going to fall out!"
2,Informative but boring,"After the first 10 min or so, I can no longer give my full attention to what I hear. Not possible to really remember all the words while many words are not used in the real world. Nice to know but will forget soon enough."
3,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"""Sea Bond"" denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste, gel, or powder, the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist, I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue.

3,15 are great. . .30 packs would be better,"I've received 4 shipment's of these through the auto ship deal. They are great. Would be even better if they offered the 30 packs at alittle less than double the price. Alas, I'll probably have to wait till the standing inventory of 15 packs is exhausted. Who the heck ever came up with the 15 pack in the first place? 12 months in a year. . .DUHsteve"
1,Extemely Dissapointed,"Received watch as a Christmas gift and within 4 days it took on condensation under the bezel (could only be due to use in the shower) and within 24 hours after that stopped keeping time altoghter. Was purchased thru FineBrandWatches and have had nothing but trouble getting thru to them to return the item. Will be filing a credit card dispute , as well as a Better Business Bureau complaint until the matter is resolved. Very dissapointed in the company and the watch."
4,Reach Act Anti-Cavity Fluoride Treatment Rinse for Kids ...,"Reach Act Anti-Cavity Fluoride Treatment Rinse for Kids has a pleasant flavor that's not too strong or overpowering. My six-year-old didn't think it was too bad, even though she was hesitant at first. She doesn't like anything minty and this product passed her test! The measuring cup is an effective tool for measuring, but if you have more than one child you need extra cups. I probably won't buy product because of twice-yearly dentist fluoride treatments and the fluoride in our water."
3,My son didn't like the bubble gum taste ...,"My son didn't like the bubble gum taste (but then, he doesn't like any tastes). I found it a little on the sweet side. The package is very easy to use with pre-measured dispenser."
1,This Does NOT taste Like Bubble Gum!,I love the taste of bubble gum and I tried this Act bubble gum flavored flouride rinse and it did not taste like bubble gum at all! If this is susposed to taste like bubble gum then it's the taste of bubble gum that has had all of the sugar sucked out and the flavor is gone. It tasted bland and boring!
5,Fantastic Photographic Artistry,"Location Portraiture: The Story Behind the ArtBill McIntosh is a living legend. One of the top photographic artist in the world today. He has elevated photography into the equivalent of the MASTER PAINTERS centuries ago. His images take photography to the highest level. He is truly an artist whether he used a word processor, a scalpel, a tennis court, a paintbrush, a courtroom-whatever vehicle he used he would be at the top. Anyone aspiring to become a portrait artist will benefit greatly by purchasing this book. If you ever get an opportunity to attend one of his workshops or to view one of his exhibits I would highly recommend it. He has contributed to our profession more than anyone alive today. This is truly PHOTOGRAPHIC ART. And he is truly a master!"
1,wrong item shipped,The book shipped was the right title but was in English when the book ordered was to be in Spanish. The packaging also indicated it was to be in Spanish.
2,bad message,"I generally dislike the Junie B. Jones books because of the terrible grammar and Junie B's bad behavior. However, the books are funny, and my daughter loves to read them, so I don't make a big issue of it. We correct the grammar as we read along.This book contained a passage that really bothered me. Junie B. gets in trouble, and her mother asks her to apologize. Junie B. says: ""A 'pology is the words I'm sorry. Except for you don't actually have to mean it. 'Cause nobody can even tell the difference."" What kind of thing is that to tell a child?! I'm glad we were reading this together so we could discuss that idea."
1,How to talk like Honey Boo Boo,"This is a great book if you want your kid to talk like Honey Boo Boo. Seriously, this book is awful for beginning readers. It is full of incorrect grammar, made up words and the kid in the story is not exactly a role model.Examples of incorrect phrases:""Spying is when you be very quiet""""I hided in the dirty clothes hamper""""'Cause I quick hided in the closet!""This book can seriously harm or delay the development of your child's reading skills. I would avoid this title and series for any beginning reader."
5,funny stuff,these books are very entertaining.im in the 8th gtade now but when i read this it was hillarious. junie b is a funny character and Super cool i would of love to be her friend if she were real
1,Not recommended at all,"This book is written for beginning readers. I found it to be highly unsuitable and in fact would not allow my child to finish reading it, once I saw what it was like. The book makes a point of using poor grammar and made up words, trying to imitate the speech of an immature child, as if that makes for funny literature. Since children reinforce their language skill by reading good literature, this kind of book will hardly benefit a child. Instead it will reinforce impoper speech that we try to teach our children to avoid. In addition, it doesn't teach good morals either. At one point in the book, the child says that it is all right to have to apologize, because you can say it and not mean it and no one will know the difference. My six year old child found it difficult to read as she had trouble with sight words that were not actually real words like bestest and 'cause."
2,Read it on the internet,"This book is softcover and the contents can be read verbatim on the internet. Unless you need a bound copy, don't waste your money."
5,Great service!,This CD only had 1 song on it that I really wanted. But it was a brand-new CD. And as stated before the service was fast!
5,Great value,"This is a great wallet, especially considering the price. The leather is soft, but not flimsy. It's comfortable in the pocket, even when completely full. I like the extra ""window"" slot for displaying my concealed weapon permit, eliminating the need for a whole seperate bifold. There are two areas to carry bills, and the long, zippered pouch is great for carrying loose change, a feature most other manufactures have either forgotten, or decided to ignore altogether."
2,Bit Disappointed,"Bit disappointed with this wallet. When you start loading it up with cards and bills, it gets rather bulky. I'm going to start looking for another wallet."
5,Great!,Purchased this wallet for my husband twice. He likes it very much and it's actually quite durable. He has many items in his wallet so it does take a pounding but the wallet has never torn. Also purchased one for my father-in-law:)
1,You get get what you pay for,"I bought this wallet because it has lots of slots for cards (why don't other makers realise that the average male carries more than 3-4 pieces of plastic?). The price was nice, but after less than two months of use the stitching has started to come loose. It's only a matter of time before the thing disintegrates and I have to replace it - and it won't be with another product from this brand."
2,Not For Big Spenders,"This wallet belongs in a purse. If you own more than three credit cards don't expect to be able to close it tight, much less fit it in your pocket without tipping yourself over. I donated mine to Goodwill."
3,tri fold wallet,Received the wallet promptly. Nice wallet but it is very thick when folded so it's a little uncomfortable in the back pocket. But on the other hand there's plenty of room for cards etc.
1,worst cookbook I've ever used,"This is one for the used book store. I got this because the recipes were non-dairy. The author attributes her baking prowess to her Viennese heritage, but I didn't find any evidence of an accomplished baker in this book. Each recipe is preceded by an incredible write up by the author. Example: the author's recipe for chocolate ""buttercream"" frosting, ""When I first tried this, I thought it was chocolate mousse, it's that good!"". When I tried it, I thought it was just a greasy mess. I tried the recipe twice, just to be sure I was following her directions exactly. Other recipes I tried: her brownies - anemic, nowhere near chocolatey enough, vanilla cake - bland and boring, and genoise -dry. I've had much better results with regular recipes where I've substituted non-dairy ingredients."
1,Very disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers. The recipes don't work. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I bought the book. I tried the Hamantashan recipe - twice. The dough is nothing but a sticky mess. Refrigerating overnight does nothing but result in a cold sticky mess. It can't be worked with and it's a waste of ingredients and time. Obviously, there is something wrong with the recipe. A suggestion to the author - try it yourself, try working all the recipes yourself using the book. Presumably they worked for you originally. Something has gone wrong in publication."
1,My Most Favorite Dessert Company,I had such high hopes. I was very disappointed--especially since there is such a need for kosher pareve recipes. The vanilla cake was gummy. The Rich pie dough is missing a whole cup of flour-so beware if you make it. It will not turn out right. I am sure the bakery is wonderful but the cookbook itself is lacking--and seeing other reviews of this book confirms this.However I will say the pumpkin pie filling was good--even if the crust around it was not.
1,The worst cookbook I ever owned - do not waste your money or your time,"This is a TERRIBLE cookbook. I wanted to try several recipes from the book before I wrote this review and now I can legitimately write that it is the WORST cookbook that I own today. I am tossing it into the trash. The pie crust recipe that I tried was dry, tasteless and impossible to roll. Sadly, it is the basis for many of the recipes. The ""buttercream"" is greasy and disgusting and the cake recipes were dry. None of the cooking times were correct. This is a very sad excuse for a cookbook."
1,What a waste!,"ingredients, time, and money. I tried several recipes and each one was more disappointing than the previous. I returned the book and have discouraged others from wasting their ingredients, time, and money."
2,Not traditional American Negro spirituals mostly.,"If you are looking for the soulfull melodic or jubilation of traditional American Negro spirituals, this is not it. But it is masterful musicianship."
4,Great Book,"This is a great trivia book for R and B and Hip-hop fans alike. I liked it so much, I bought one for my brother."
4,Great for the price!,"I purchased this Bubblesaurus for our son, and he loves it. It is a little tricky to fill without making a mess, but the bubbles last forever. The bubble machine produces a nice amount of bubbles and is easy to use. This bubble machine works great with Little Tikes Bubble Solution, Miracle Bubbles, and Super Miracle Bubbles. Overall, I think this is a great product for the price."
1,works as long as you have the original bubble liquid,"My Son loved this bubble blower. It made tons of bubbles and he and all of his little friends just loved it. The batteries didn't die quickly like in other bubble blowers but what got this toy just one start is the fact that once you run oout of the ""Little Tikes Bubble Bottle"" that comes with the toy that's it! It is useless with other bubbles liquid brands and for some riddiculous reason Little Tikes does not sell refills of its bubble liquid that its bubble blower only seems to accept. I think the blower likes a thicker liquid and most others are much thinner so it doesn't coat the bubble maker adequately enough. So, in short, it only works as long as you have the bubble fluid that comes with the toy. After that, get something else. Or avoid the aggravation and just buy another bubble maker."
1,Worthless,My daughter received the lion one as a birthday gift yesterday. This thing is so cheap! It doesn't work at all. You are supposed to squeeze the handle until bubbles come out of it's mouth. I squeezed and squeezed and nothing came out. Not even a squirt of solution. It's also VERY messy getting the solution into the toy. Don't waste your money!
1,Terrible Bubble Blower....,"We bought this for my son and we ended up throwing it out. The other reviewers are right - once you run out of the bubbles it comes with, you are out of luck..."
1,Was not Happy,This one is very hard to fill without spilling and it leaks very quickly through the bottom. I used rechargeable batteries that i had to wash off after each use as they were covered in soap. And with all that leaked out my kids didnt get to use it long before it was empty.
3,Inspiring Read,"Although I have not read through the whole book, it has some great info and has renewed my interest in drawing the human form."
1,*ABSOLUTE CRUD*,"*WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS CD FOLKS! * I am telling you all, this is the WORST video game music CD I have ever purchased. I don't understand why this CD has any 5 stars at all! I am a musician, and you can trust me, this CD has the most irritating, strange, and sorry composition I have ever heard. Buy Chrono Trigger's or Final Fantasy VII's soundtrack instead and you'll be much more satisfied. The only reason why I bought it was to have a full Final Fantasy collection, but I NEVER EVER listen to this horrible CD. Do yourself a favor and buy something else!"
3,"Not Uematsu's best score, but it has its moments","_Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec_ is the orchestral version of Nobuo Uematsu's score for Final Fantasy VIII and, as those out there who have followed Uematsu's work know, it isn't his best score. Nonetheless, this set of compositions is rather nice to listen to, showing off the first j-pop piece which Uematsu has written, Faye Wong's ""Eyes on Me,"" and his continuing exploration of Latin choral pieces (""Liberi Fatali""). The orchestra manages to handle the pieces well, which is a refreshing bit of news after the poor-quality _Final Fantasy VII Reunion_. The only thing I cannot understand about this CD, is why ""Man with the Machine Gun"" was included, because it's the last track from the OST that the listening would expect to be arranged for orchestral performance."
5,Transformed into beautiful orchestrated music.,"I loved the Final Fantasy titles and couldn't wait to get a soundtrack of the music of them. When I got the music to Final Fantasy VIII, i got this CD, instead of the original soundtrack. I love the music on this CD. All of the pieces are turned into great music for anything and not just listening to for th game. All people will love the music on this CD, if they did or didn't play the famous RPG."
4,Not bad!,"While I normally don't pay much for music, this one intrigued me. I wanted to know what was so awesome about this soundtrack that would be worth so much money. After listening to the entire album through three times, I decided that this project was really not such a bad deal after all! The music grew on me; the more I listened to it, the more beautiful it got. While there was a lot of repetitive themes, the melodies were memorable and almost singable in the shower. All in all, this soundtrack was good enough for me to recommend it to my friends in spite of the price!"
3,conformed to his image,"This book is more like a textbook than a book that you just sit down and read. I'm sure I will find it valuable, but probably won't read it in the way that I thought I would."
5,Ephesians 1:15 - 23,Dr. Boa provides an indepth understanding of who we are in Jesus. He transcends religousness and captures the essence of truly following after Jesus - a clear discipleship of Jesus. He provides great insights on the pursuit of Jesus. Thru Dr. Boa's book you can begin to see the God who truly loves us and has our best intentions in mind. A real must read for those seriously pursuing Jesus.
5,An excellent guide to spiritual formation,Kenneth Boa masterfully coordinates the various perspectives in Christian Spirituality throughout history to present a well-rounded approach to spiritual formation. A must read for anyone involved in church leadership or discipleship.
3,Verify Size,"This review is on GBC 2001874 Designer Contemporary embossed presentation covers, olive with window. Purchased 2007 give or take. The size as listed on package is 11"" x 8.5"", the same size as most printer paper. Which makes the binded package seem sloppy because some of the pages stick out beyond the cover. Card stock - some where around 120lb. Not cardboard thick. Little flimsy, but not bad. Nice pattern, I like the window effect."
3,A bit of a letdown,"I like Mike Shepherd/Moscoe and have enjoyed the books set in this universe, with the exception of ""They Also Serve""; I was really looking forward to this after Mutineer, which I thought did a good job framing the series. I came away a bit disappointed. I still like Kris Longknife's character, and find her less wooden and more realistic than Weber's Honor Harrington. But does she need to be a prime minister's daughter and billionaire and now a Princess too? The whole United Sentients overlay and royalty structure seems ill-thought out and cumbersome. The book also suffers from some long dry spells that could use editing - the whole intelligence mission in the Arab quarter could have been dispensed with. For a space opera, there's very little space. I hope the 3rd book, in which Kris commands a ship, gets the series back on track and more like ""First Casualty"" and ""Price of Peace""."
4,Deserter,"This book flowed smoothly from start to finish. I enjoyed it, and look forward to reading more of the series."
3,Better than average but marred by plot inconsistencies,"In Deserter Kris is assigned to a Kamakize class ship to sort out the problems with smart metal technology.They come to a place where there will be nearly a month stoppage of work, at the same time Tom (one of Krfis'sfriends) takes off to a new planet looking for runs. He is with Penny who calls Kris to let her know Tom wasapparently kidnaped by Sandfire a hatchet man for Peterwald. How Penny winds up making the call as describedturns up mysteriously on turns up on Turantic where Tom was taken as military attache is one of several looseends in the plot that are glazed over.Overall a good read although marred by plot problems still well above average for the janre, because of theinconsistencies-another was a 15 digit phone number that only had 14 digits-I only gave it 3 stars."
2,Liberal Dogma,Good action. Good yarn. Liberal dogma gets thrown in for no reason. It does nothing to further the story line. Seems preachy
5,Will buy again!,I just received this ring and it is gorgeous. The weight of the sterling and the quality of the craftsmanship is unbelievable and for such a fabulous price.I will buy from this company again and again!
2,Not Sure If It Actually Works,The darn thing goes off constantly. The instructions are not very explicit or maybe we just can't figure it out. I don't think its worth it. But it could be fun pretending.
4,metal detector,"It arrived safely, it was all that it was said to be, however,in the heavy snow that we have, it is difficult to determine how effective it is!"
4,Metal Detector of Grandson's Xmas Gift,My grandson's said they like the detector's but got bored with them when they couldn't find anything. Their attention span is very short being 9 and 13.
3,American Hawks H.P Basic Metal Detector,I bought the product for my grand children. It is very difficult to calibrate it for use when I am not present.
1,It detects itself,The coil detects the metal handle. The only way I could get it to work was to disconnect the coil from the handle and hold it away 4 or 5 inches.
2,lost ring,"I bought this product because I thought I would find my ring I lost outside in the snow. I played with this product inside the house first, It picked up everything except jewlery. I also hid a ring under a rug to see if it would beep, no beep. So I took it outside in the snow and burried a ring thinking I was going to find it, but to my surprise no beeps for the ring. I have not sent the product back yet but I do plan on doing so. My dear old wedding ring is still lost outside in the snow. The only way the thing would make a noise is if a ring was touching directly on the ring. I did not like it but you can try it might not have worked for me but it may work for you."
3,METAL DETECTOR,I have only used it a few short times but it seems to do a good job for this beginer..
4,Great Value.,"My son received a metal detector for Christmas and was so excited, but we never could get it together to make it work. He was so disappointed when we returned it. I had been searching for months to find a replacement. I came across this one, read the reviews, and decided to give it a try. It was delivered quickly and easy to assemble. He started using it right away and loves it. He has been able to find lots of buried ""treasures."""
2,Metal Detector ok for small children,This is a small metal detector. I think it would be ok for ages 8 and under. The arm doesn't extend far enough for an adult. All in all you get what you pay for.
1,Metal detector toy,"This is not a true metal detector. After reading initial reviews which were all good, I bought this for my son. We burried some coins an inch down in the ground so he could have some fun on Christmas morning. The ""detector"" couldn't find most of them. It only seemed to work when we had it turned up really high , but then it would go off almost continually, even when there was no metal to be detected.Don't waste your money."
5,Muy Bien! Wonderful!,"This spanish'version El Fantasma de la opera is a wonderful ""adaptation"" from the original english version The phantom of the opera. The voices of the singers have the same powerful than in the english version. Except for Raoul who, when he sing, seem to miss some powerful in is voices sometimes. But except this, it's a very, very good cast!"
5,So Awesome,"This is really nice, The recording is great the Phantom's(Juan Navarro)is great , Nice voice Best Phantom I have ever heard, Sorry Michael Crawford you have a Clone in spanish and a bit better just for his deep,Rich voice of Juan Navarro.Juan Navarro sings just right, too bad he doesnt sing it in English.I dont know if he does.If they would of useJuan Navarro's Voice in the Movie for the spanish Version it would of been soo much Cool.Imagine Gerard buttler with Juan Navarro's voice,In spanish version Soooooo Hot lol.well.Great Singing.Christine(Irasema Terrazas)Good singing but her voice is just more mature,but good.Raoul(Jose Joel)Hes good but voice too thin.sings okReally nice music in Spanish.Its worth having this cd.I love it ."
5,SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS CD IN SPANISH,"I WAS SO LUCKY TO SEE THIS MUSICAL IN MEXICO CITY IN 2000. AND IT WAS AMAZING. THAT IS TRUE ,SOME LIRYCS SOUND FORCED BUT IT'S ONLY A FEW, IRAZEMA TERRAZAS HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE..."
5,One of the Best Recordings,"El Fantasma de la Opera is one of the best Phantom recordings. Although, there are some translation problems it, it is quite good. The roles of christine and the phantom compare as good as the original london cast. Spanish makes the love story of the Phantom soar well above it's origins in England. If you are a Phan than you must have this cd. It came on time and was in perfect condition. Hope this helped."
4,...and this girl's got SOUL!,"Not soul in the bump-and-grind ""unh! good god!"" manner, and not this look how good I can sing manner favored by today's songstresses (Toni Braxton and Christina Aguilera couldn't hold a single note steady if their careers depended on it). DUsty can knock 'em dead. Points off for so much of the ""top of the pops"" of the time...who needs to hear ""You Don't Own Me"" again? Some of the choices are inspired, though...her version of Lee Dorsey's ""DO-Re-Mi"" is an unexpected surprise, and her hits ""Wishin' and Hopin'"", ""I Only Want to Be WIth You"" (in a different mix) and ""All Cried OUt"" are here."
2,Not terribly useful,"I am studying Vietnamese in college, and I have found that this book causes more confusion than it helps. It does not cleary define words, and it is inconsistent when translating from english to vietnamese and vietnamese to english. I would definitely not recommend this book. However, I did give it two stars (instead of one) because it did contain some obscure words I would not be able to find else where (like 'Jesus freak'). :)"
1,probably the worst dictionary I have ever had to use,This seems to be made up of many obsolete words. There was no intoduction to explain how the Vietnamese alphabet is used - that it is in a different order than in English. It explains to the Vietnamese user how the English is pronounced but does not do the same for the English speaker.
2,There are better dictionaries out there,"This dictionary is just plain awful! Most of the basic words are present, but a lot of harder words are not. What good is a dictionary when some of the more complex vocabulary words aren't even defined in there? Moreover, there are typos on some of the pages. I don't know if every copy of this dictionary has this problem, but the one that I got had several Vietnamese-English pages missing in the end.While I still give it 2 stars because it was useful in a couple of instances, I would not recommend using it overall. There are many better, newer dictionaries out there."
4,Good ESL Vietnamese-English/ English-Vietnamese Dict.,"This is a good standard dictionary that can help any Vietnamese communicate with a Non-Vietnamese speaker and vice versa. It has been very helpful to my nephew,who is an English Second Language learner, in school and at home. It helps to explain to a Vietnamese user how English is pronounced. It's not the best or newest font, but it is readable. It is a simple good dictionary that helps to explain the meaning of words in Vietnameses and English."
2,Not as thrilled with this one.,Wasn't the kind of music that I thought it was. Maybe I'll like it more as I work up to it.
2,Don't buy this for France!,"I purchased this product for a trip to France, as the voltage their is 220 so a simple plug converter is not sufficient. However, upon arrival I found that this one does not work anywhere in France, as they have recessed cylindrical plugs, so this won't even plug in. I will say that the company did stand behind their product though and gave me an RMA to return for a refund, so this is not a criticism of them per se, just be sure that it is compatible with the plug style where you're going."
3,Sex and Mischief Abroad,"Strange, honest book of the young author galavanting around Egypt in an era of white men's assumed world domination.In a way, it is very much like Jack Kerouac's On The Road, with Flaubert himself as the freewheeling Neal Cassady. Actually, the two books could be an interesting comparison study. It would also be a useful reference for critiques of Orientalism and Colonialism.If you like reading travel accounts, this is at times a very engaging one. His tales herein have a powerful lingering effect. But the sex and masturbation and reckless fun got tiresome in a hurry. After reading this, I lost some respect for the man who was Flaubert, even though I continue to find his writing irresistible."
3,More on Flaubert than Egypt,"This book's value lies largely in the insight into the personality of Flaubert that it provides. The commentary on ancient Egypt is virtually nil. Flaubert's commentary on the Egypt of 1849 is rather interesting, but limited here as well. I was looking for more on ancient Egypt out of this book, but Flaubertistas may not be disappointed. There are a few photos and drawings of interest."
4,Voices from across the water,"This album feels like you should be listening to it outside on a cool autumn day. I don't understand a word but the emotion of the songs tell the story - a beautiful chorus of strong men shouting together, weeping together and joyfully going forth. A wonderful edition for those with eclectic tastes. =)"
2,So many errors!,"I made the terrible mistake of touring Idaho with an old (1994) edition of the DeLorme Idaho Atlas. Fortunately I had a whole sackful of BLM and Forest Service maps to get me out of tight situations caused by relying on DeLorme's information. The atlas shows roads that are not there, and does not show roads that are there. The land management boundaries are incorrect in many crucial instances, and sites are drastically misplaced.I very much like the additional topographical information in the new edition, but I also noticed they did not correct any of the cartographic errors. So-- fine for casual use or for general trip planning, but contact the BLM or Forest Service before you head out on the back roads."
4,Great way to research Idaho's outdoors,"For planning a trip to Idaho, what could be better than having topo maps of the whole state in one book? Locate trails and campgrounds, look up ranger stations and regulations, or just day-dream. Excellent research tool! I have them for every Northwest state."
2,Dull sound in these reissues,"I had high hopes for this reissue of the magical recordings by Schnabel of the Beethoven sonatas. The engineers did an admirable job of reducing the surface noise from the 78 rpm disks. But they took out the sparkle from the keys that can be heard on the ""Schnabel Plays Beethoven"" Pearl editions of these recordings, or the ""Beethoven: Piano Works"" Naxos editions."
5,With eyes wide shut,"The book is a comprehensive and concise record of the events leading up to the Independence of Zimbabwe. However, there is a vailed and or latent theme in this book that is disturbing, and that theme is the veiling of Racism by a racist , with the disguise of intergrating Africans gradually into main stream politics or the creation of "" Uncle Toms. This book is insightful yet needs to be read with wide open eyes."
4,"The truth of how the Vorster regime "" dumped "" Rhodesia","Having lived in the country and have had many facts hidden from us during the white regime, it is a real let down, to see how the Vorster regime let us down so badly and not letting Smith handle it with the Chiefs."
3,Fascinating Rhodesian History,"This is the classic Rhodesian book by its last leader. Obviously quite bitter, Smith nonetheless captures the players and the negotiations well because of his firsthand access."
2,Difficult to rate,"I really struggled to come up with a rating of the book. Growing up white in Rhodesia and then Zimbabwe I used to idolize Smith, but this book changed my view of him. It is not often that an autobiography changes your view of the author for the worse, but this one did. The book is okay but his level of arrogance gets very tiresome very quickly."
1,cost too much for the results,"I felt ripped off after I gave 37.00 a bottle for it then found out it cost 4.09 on another web site.Found another product called Secure that works much better,you can eat,drink and even clean your teeth and they stay in.It's 7.99 but well worth it."
5,A+ for product.....F+ to company for prices!!!!!,"Although this is a great product, I truly believe the company is taking advantage of the older generation by pricing this item so high. I do the ordering of the products for my Aunt but now thank God we were introduced to a compatible product called Holdtite that works great. I hope that everyone gets word of this new product and quit ordering from these people so they will have no choice but to bring their prices back down."
5,Slings & Arrows,"If you are involved in theater in any way, shape or form - this series is a MUST SEE. The writing is incredible, the acting is first-rate. Do not miss this ."
3,Slings & Arrows Gift,This item was purchased as a gift. Have no personal review of my own to state.Recepient has not offered any review of the item.
4,Slings & Arrows Is Not To Be Missed!,"Having attended the Stratford Festival in the past, this was a perfect compliment/send-up of what it could be like to mount a Shakespearean festival. Not only is this witty, well-written and well-acted; but it also provides short excerpts from Hamlet, Macbeth & King Lear. Just wish they had done more than three seasons. My only complaint is that the ""extras"" CD was not very informative."
5,Slings & Arrows Complete 3 Seasons,"Does it get any better than this? Witty, clever, at times hilarious, and also poignant, this Canadian series is a brilliant look at the theatre in general, and a Shakespeare festival in particular. It is beautifully acted and edited, and the absolute truth for an arts festival struggling to balance the demands of artistic excellence with financial survival. We fell in love with the characters and had a very hard time stopping watching between episodes. Great performances, great storytelling and great understanding of the artistic process. Highest possible recommendation!!!!"
5,Slings & Arrows - Or How I Remember Why I Left The Theatre,"For those of us who had a past career in repertory theatre, this series is a cleverly writtten and gloriously acted reminder of all that made us leave the business. For those who are considering working in reportory theatre, or any other industry that depends on disfunctional interpersonal relationships, blind luck and raw talent, watch this series first - before signing anything!The scripts are great, the story lines believable, (as in most of this DID happen to me at some time in this industry), and the acting is delivered by an ensemble cast of fabulous character actors who deserve recognition. The only problem, is that there are only 3 seasons. I want more! More to remind me of the sheer joy of performing, and more to remind me why I left the business for a more civilized creative career.This series is so good, I had to buy all episodes! Great dialogue, great direction and some of the best stories ever! Buy it, watch it, love it!"
5,Sublime!,"If there is a better television series produced about community theatre, I haven't seen it. This series masterfully touches every emotion and leaves you breathless. Even though the series revolves around community theatre, it isn't just for those thespians amongst us. It is for everyone. If you've ever laughed, cried or screamed in frustration, this series is for you."
5,THE Best T.V. show you never saw!!,"This gem is THE best t.v show ever for anyone who loves well written, well performed, well produced, smart comedy. If you love theater, better yet. This set consists of all episodes of the series' 3-season life. Slings and Arrows tells the tangled, torturous and hilarious tales of the lives of the artists at a regional theatre company in Canada. Each season focuses on the company producing one major Shakespearian tragedy. ... hilariously... and with moments of sheer sublime magic. You don't have to be a theater insider (though if you are- what a treat you are in for!) to enjoy this. It is goofy, sexy, romantic, quirky, brilliant and totally cool."
5,Slings & Arrows,I have recommended this to many many teachers. I would love to use this in the classroom to introduce kids to Shakespeare.
2,Is this Casual?,"O.K. I'm a huge Hieroglyphics fan, and I want to know what happened to Casual? I've been looking forward to this album for years and I'm really disapointed. Almost every song is about ""going to the club, lookin' for a woman to rub"". Not your typical Hiero sound at all. Just listen to the sound clips and see for yourself. What happened to the song ""Turkey and Dressing""? This song alone could have saved the album. I also believe that leaving the production on the whole album to Domino could have saved it as well. Hopefully on his future collaboration album with Del, called ""The Smash Brothers"", he will sound different.I'm sure some people will still like this album, but your average Hiero fan will be shaking his/her head in disbelief.If you want really good Hieroglyphics, pick up Pep Love, Souls of Mischief, Del the funky homosapien, or the family album titled 3rd Eye Vision.Casual gets 2 stars from me. Sorry Casual, but your not ""The Same O.G."""
5,new cas: ok!,"cas, along with every other member of the hiero crew, has had to reinvent himself. His flows are sick, and he commmands the mic with authority. Pretty much a polar opposite to fellow crew member Pep Love's recently released album, but nonetheless good. Production is once again different than any hiero album. Cas is the Same O.G. with a new twist"
3,Turn from hiero,"This is a nice gansta-club-lyricist blend. not the usual from hieroglyphics cru. almost the exact opisite style of hiero glyphics teamate del who takes a more abstract mind-blowing aproach to his subject matter--however tis is nice no real ""bad"" songs sounds like cas juss aimin to have some fun on this one. so in closing nice for juss kickin it but if you want somethin that you've never heard before and that will lieave you breathless pick up del's DELTRON 3030 on ark 75 records"
3,Not what I expected..but okay,"I picked this up just cause I really like Del and thought I'd try something else from the Hiero crew. I'd heard a song or two from Casual before but found myself rather disappointed when I listened to this....for me it was too ""gangstafied""..."
2,Not good for sensitive skin,I bought this soap because I use to like the Garden Tomato soap that Burt's Bees made. This soap is definitely not as good as the Tomato one. I thought it was a pretty OK soap until I started having an allergic reaction to it. I wish the box it came on had the ingredients listed on it so I could figure out what's in it that I'm allergic to. It might be a good soap for other people with less sensitive skin.
1,Anything about nothing & nothing about anything!,"For a real CFO, this one is actually too heavy to read through. As for the practician, although graced with beautiful charts and diagrams, it ain't provide any real beef, either. It is a sample of ""anything about nothing and nothing about anything"". Vague!"
2,Nice but..,"These panties are a nice material, fit when I first put them on and felt comfortable..but they wouldn't stay in place, kept sliding down, and I had to constantly be pulling them up."
2,A mid-20th century girl becomes a vet despite sexism,A girl grows up loving animals and decides to become a vet. A fictional story told in a non-fiction style with black-and-white photographs.
5,A perfect old-fashioned story,"This is a book that makes you think back to your own childhood. To times that were simpler, sweeter, and full of dreams. The writing is a dream, and the story is perfect for the little girl on your Christmas list. What little girl today, even in the age of computers and scooters, doesn't love a doll, one, doll, a special doll, more than anything else? Pamela Jane captures the mystery of childhood, the dream of dance, and the promise of the imagination."
4,Black Hawk Serpa holster,"This is deffinetly a good holster that is cheap and can be used if you are just going to practice at the range or if your are a investigator going on duty. The company that sold this item to me was Optic Sale and those guys really took care of me to get the order right. They need to get a rating of 5 out of 5 stars because of their awesome customer service. They worked on getting holsters for my whole department and gave me a great discount for law enforcement. I couldn't be more pleased with there level of professionalisim, thanks Optic sale."
2,Dont buy if you have a 92A1 or 96A1,"Even though the description says 92/96, this will not fit the A1 series which is fairly new. They do not have a hard case holster that will fit this. Thanks to amazon for the easy return."
4,great,"well made, arrived promptly fit my glock 19 like a charm I would recommend this holster to any leftie shooter"
4,"Blackhawk Serpa Sportster Holster, Size 03 (1911)","Great holster at a great price point. As it's not meant to be a conceal & carry holster, this paddle functions exactly as it should. The finger release trains you to keep your index finger extended past the trigger guard. You can't beat this holster for the money."
2,Not worth the money,"This is a deceptive product. The color in the picture is not accurate, the holster I recieved was gun metal grey rather than black. The lock release button does not work properly and I had to make modifications. Don't buy."
5,Secure and easy to pull,"This is the best concealed holster i've bought. It keeps your pistol secure yet easy to draw. It also keeps everything close to your body so that you aren't showing as badly with clothes. Another plus is the hard plastic keeps your gun from getting scuffed up when wearing with your seatbelt.I've also just found out that I can interchange with a shoulder or belt base with the same holster. same great holster with three carry options.The only downside is the inner hook that makes it so secure to stop people from grabbing your entire setup from you is a huge pain to take off. It's good and bad, a pain to take off when you want to but nearly impossible for someone to take it from you when your conscious."
4,Great holster,What I like about this holster is that it is very stable. It would be very difficult to accidentally pull the holster out while drawing.
3,Acceptable,"I am happy with this. A little bulkier than I expected, but works ok, and a good value for the price."
5,I LIKE IT,"I shoot tactical drills, Magpul, IDPA, and got to say it is a well designed peice of equipment. SAFE, STURDY, and EASY to use. Not comfortable while seated in a car though. The price is competitive, and favorable."
5,Nice holster,"Not much to say here other than it works great. I have a Sig Sauer P229 and it fits in there nicely. If you don't have a sturdy, good-fitting belt than this'll make your pants all wonky when you try to pull it out sometimes. It's loosened up a bit (in a good way) since I opened the box."
4,Ease of use,Great fit for my XD and allows for safe access to the weapon. The only draw back is the large (to large) belt clip. It is difficult to get on and even more difficult to get off.
3,good holster but....,Its a good holster but... it didn't fit my sig p250. The paddle is black so it kinda looks funny. I later found out that the 250 DC is the overseas model. So if you want one for the 250 use the sig pro 2022.
5,Great Value!,Very happy with this holster for my 1911. Fits like a glove and has a cool gray finish. Locks the gun tight and securely.
4,Good range holster,"Fair all around but great for the range holster, keeps weapon snug and secure. Not ideal for concealed carry due to it's bulkiness."
4,Great holster for the price.,"I would recommend this holster for any OWB application, including competition. I purchased this intending to get the belt attachment with it, but the paddle isn't too bad so I might stick with it. Some instructors claim the paddles move the holster a lot, but I didn't experience that in training/competition yet. My paddle magazine holster moves a lot more, but it doesn't have as many mechanisms to keep it steady as this holster does.The holster does have a bad reputation among some circles for being dangerous because of the locking mechanism, but I think that's the same crowd that thinks Glocks aren't safe because they have no safeties. It's all about training."
4,Great holster,Great looking and well built holster at a even better price. gun has no play when in holster. Only downside is that it might make minor scratches on gun.
4,Great holster but not for concealed cary,"This holster is perfect for range and also events such as 3 gun etc... Use this weekly and love it, it will lock your pistol in place with the slide forward or back and is very easily accessible when drawing."
3,works fine but glock fits loose,i have had mine for two weeks love the holster except that it has already put holster wear on my gun because it fits loose to a glock 23. the inside plastic bevel rubs right below the chamber. needles to say i don't use it often due to wear on my 3 week old glock
5,Great holster,"I bought this Serpa holster for my Gen III Glock 32 .357, it also fits my Gen II Glock 17 9mm, though about 1/2"" of the barrel protrudes at the bottom, which makes no difference. The weapons fit perfectly and draw smoothly. The holster is adjustable for cant angle by loosening the 3 screws that attach it to the paddle and the retention level is adjustable with a set screw. I actually bought this holster with the intent of attaching it to a plate carrier vest using the Blackhawk S.T.R.I.K.E. mount but now I'm considering keeping it as is for concealed carry. For the price, you can't find a better holster."
4,Secure carry holster,Good purchase for the price. Takes a little practice to achieve proper grip and finger placement for the draw but reasonable competence gained within an hour that will improve more over time. Provides very good security without the need for a strap - results in faster access. It's a keeper.
4,Holster for Glock,"This holster is very good at securig my weapon. The angle is adjustable to make is usable for both right side or cross draw on the left side. I found usin the belt clips to be more advantageous to me than the paddle in the pants method but, it works well both ways. I have recommended this product to a brother-in-law who has said he will order it also.I was very pleased with Amazon and will probably order other products."
4,Just as listed,"Arrived as pictured for my Kimber Pro Comp II. Snug fit, although, requires some trimming. The plastic was not trimmed after the injection molding manfacturing. Very happy with product. Would not use for concealed carry."
4,"Great holster, but not really concealable","This is a great holster overall. It looks awesome, and my Glock 19 fits solid. The operation is smooth and I like the Serpa mechanism which keeps it secure, while having a quick release.But, to call this a concealment holster is just not accurate. It is no more concealment than a standard hip holster."
4,Holster,"You can't beat the price. Holds my glock 21 safely and securely for outdoors trips, hunting etc.Stayed firm on my side while hiking brush during deer season this year..."
3,DOES NOT FIT NEW STYLE Sig P250C,"Just a heads up to my fellow P250C owners: This holster does not accept the newer style P250C with the square rail. I've searched all over trying to find a retention holster, and everyone loves the Serpa's so I gave it a shot. Gave it 3 stars just to keep in the middle as I'm sure it's a great holster for the right gun. We have one of these for a Kimber CDPII and it works fine!"
4,Weird fit on subcompact XD-9,"I bought the CQC Sportster holster for my XD-9 Subcompact and I'm pretty sure it'll fit every XD. My subcompact has about an inch-and-a-half of space for the barrel to the bottom of the holster.In fact I don't really have to lift the pistol out of the holster, I can basically just rock it back and it comes out, assuming I press the release and draw like normal (it still locks the sub XD in place). It's very quick compared to the tactical serpa I have for my 1911 (covers all of the slide, including rear sights).I'd recommend this, even if it is a little weird for my little XD."
5,Blachawk Holster,"Its a Blackhawk ... what more can you say. Just the ticket for my P220. Easy in and easy out. The side release button is in line with the trigger, so, as the firearm comes out your index finger is where it should be. Firearm is held securely in place by the holster..no worries there."
1,To small for Glock 21,"I have Glock 21 this holster is to small for this gun. Don't buy if you have this gun, pack says works with glock 21 but does not say which Gen."
5,I love this holster!,"I am really happy with this product. I dont write reviews, but for this, I will. My old holster was no good. My gun would get stuck when I tried to draw it. This thing is like butta'. Buy it."
4,Left handed gun,The holster is very compact and fits perfectly with my Glock model 23. I have used it with my regular belt and it works comfortably. Great price for the holster.
3,Well atleast the gun fits...,"This is not the quality that I am used to with Blackhawk products. This is about as cheap as you can get with a blackhawk holster. I personally just needed it to adapt my existing holster to left hand draw. This DOES NOT come with the belt adapter. It is ONLY a paddle holster. This is kind of sad, but it is the standard blot pattern from Blackhawk, so you can attach it to any other Blackhawk products, ie. molle mounts, belt mounts, shoulder mounts, leg mounts, etc."
5,Fine holster,This holster is excellent. I love that it's secure and that the pistol can only be released with a button press from your index finger. It's smooth and very natural.My 1911 fits in nicely and it attaches securely to my waist with and without a belt. It looks totally awesome. The thing is hard to take off though as it hooks very nicely into your belt. That is actually a good thing. No one will be pulling this thing off of you.Obviously a 1911 isn't the easiest of guns to conceal carry but it can be done with this holster if you are wearing a jacket. Personally I don't even bother. I like to open carry my 1911 when out in the desert shooting and when I'm on my property.Overall this is a 5 star product.
4,Paddle holster,This just what I wanted. I am very impressed with quality and the ease of use. I do wish they would have made space for the laser sight below the barrel.
1,Do not buy for a Taurus PT1911,"Do not buy this holster if you have a Taurus PT1911 as although the 1911 goes in smooth enough it does not come out. It's not the trigger guard retention, the holster internal size is too snug. I had to resort to employing a dremel cutting wheel along the top of the holster to free my gun and in the process slightly nicked the same. As mine is polished stainless I'll have to do some research on how to polish the top of the slide to remove the blemish.Pros: the price and it is well made.Cons: although listed to fit a 1911 with or without rail, it does NOT work for the Taurus PT1911 with rail.As I had to destroy the holster to save my gun, (liberally pouring oil down the inside did not work)I basically wasted the price of the holster and damaged my prize 1911 in the process. Understandably I am quite disgusted with this product and can not recommend it to anybody for a Taurus PT1911"
1,Holster does not fit as advertised,"Nov 22, 2012 Product Update. I was mistaken about the holster in that it does fit the earlier model of the Sig P250Compact but not their newer model. Advertising write up could have stated things a little clearer. Although the holster did not fit the pistol, there is absolutely nothing wrong with Blackhawk holsters. I carry my Springer Mil-Spec in one and love it.This holster was advertised to fit the Sig P250DC (Compact). Well, it doesn't fit the new version of the P250Compact. It may fit the old, I don't know but it doesn't fit the new. I will be asking to return this item. This is not a reflection on Blackhawk holsters. I have one for my 1911A1 that works wonderfully which is why I was looking to purchase another over the ill fitting similar functioning holster from Sig Sauer."
4,Blackhawk serpa level 2 holster,"This holster is very nice and durable when it works. When I first got it for my airsoft 1911 i couldn't get it to fit at all. After heating it up with a hot hair dryer and kept putting the weapon in and out it eventually loosened up and now it works very well! I would def. recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice holster. plus it is a Blackhawk holster, in my opinion the best brand of holsters out there.SWAT."
1,they shipped the wrong one !!,First of let me start by saying that the holster is great packaged well and brand new out of the box. I ordered the black hawk serpa holster for a Springfield XD but they sent me one for the Glock 22 !! dont know how that happend so i guess im out some money ?
3,Great price for what you get,"I bought this for my S&W M&P9. It fits well as described. It's a little bulky and while it hasn't been a problem for me, I'm not thrilled that the lock release is in line with the trigger. I was also a little disappointed that while my M&P22 fit this holster, it scratches the barrel whenever you draw. I will probably end up purchasing a different holster."
4,Holster,This is a good holster for the money. It fits my Kimber 1911 pretty good. It allows me to conceal it pretty well due to the fact it is a little adjustable but if you do not have a full size 1911 like mine there is about an inch of wasted plastic. It's also nice that it locks it into place and covers the trigger but when you press the release with your trigger finger it slides out and leaves your tigger finger right were it needs to be. Over all worth it.
2,..,Mostly a compilation album. Most of the songs are off Iron Man and Supreme Caliente.. may be a few original songs. The copy that i have doesn't have Winter Warz on it.. i dunno maybe they're different copies running around someplace. You can definatly find better than this in the Wu camp.36 ChambersWu ForeverTicalOnly built for cuban linxLiquid SwordsBrooklyn ZooIron Manall wu classics (no specific order) look out for the new Meth album and Masta Killa.
3,a compilation album?,"its a greatest hits cd made up of lots of songs that are far from his greatest.all these songs are from iron man, supreme clientele or bulletproof wallets.if you want to get into ghostface, buy ironman."
5,ghostface showers us with hits,"personally i dont write many reviews, but after listening to ghostfaces latests album i felt i needed to let people know how good it is, well its real good most properly the best so far this year in my view,even though it aint a new album as it has mainly old joints,but the new ones are great,especially ghost showers which flips in and out of tempo's with one the sickest beats i have heard for a while,how can mans forget all that i got is you which i think is one of the most heartfelt rhymes ever about hard times growing up,why ghostface realesed this album and not a full studio album?only the WU knowsoverall? most definatley worth money"
3,Sup Wu heads,"Dont buy this cd. For real if we wanted some mix cds we'd get them off kazaa, RIGHT? Get the Ironman cd, that is what made rap/hip hop what it is today."
1,Can Anyone Tell Me What's On This Disc?,Has anyone bought this CD? I'm interested but not willing to buy without knowing what's included? Is it a greatest hits compilation?
2,...a letdown...,"For the novice/beginner collector, this guide will serve as a basic introduction with lots of really great pictures and general information on some modern novelty candy containers. But for advanced/serious collectors, this guide is not helpful. The valuation on most of these items is, in my opinion, inaccurate and historically there are many great items that were not included or mentioned. The organization of the items is poor and the authors could have really used this platform to give advice and encouragement or helpful information to current/future collectors. More research was needed."
4,Good book,I gave this book to my Dad who attended Ole Miss at the same time Meredith was there. He felt the book was an accurate depiction of the events and has throughly enjoyed reading it.
4,"Wonderful writing, fascinating subject to see through his eyes","""In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War"" is the second memoir from Tobias Wolff. This one deals with his time in the Vietnam War, hence the title. Written 30 years or so after he volunteered to join the army - in part to give his writing a purpose like Hemingway's.Wolff's chapters can each stand alone as short stories. They are not action-packed, but moving, written by a now seasoned writer who has had time to reflect. Wonderful writing, fascinating subject to see through his eyes."
5,Almost O'Brien,"This is the second best book I've read on Vietnam. Only Tim O'Brien's The things They Carried is better. Brought back a lot of old, buried memories for me."
2,Not among the best of the Vietnam books,"There is something about Wolff that puts me off. I couldn't empathize with him in reading This Boys Life. I could understand how critics would think well of it--it does READ well. But as a person, I didn't like him. He carries this unlikablity (not as bad as Dubya, mind you) into In Pharoah's Army. I didn't like how he managed to become an officer in the Army. Somehow his book comes off as less authentic than other books about Vietnam. Compare it to Tim O'Brien or Philip Caputo (or even my own, Waiting for Westmoreland) and he comes out too detached and sometimes not entirely believable. I am not saying he ripped off Graham Greene, but he also shares a fair bit of style and tone with The Quiet American. Still, it may be worth reading if only to contrast it with the others out there."
3,An Opinion From a Teen/Student's Point of View,"I was given this book to read for a History report/research project. It wasn't a bad book. It had its draw backs. Didn't neccessarily draw my attention too much b/c it wasn't that interesting. It's not action packed with alot of fighting going on. Some parts were disappointing b/c you would get excited as to what was going to happen next and there was climax but no falling action. I would have to say the reason I did like it was b/c it was down to earth, a very honest book. IMO it was a little slow moving."
5,Another great memoir by Wolff.,"After reading ""This Boy's Life"", I had to read ""In Pharoah's Army"", even though I have no interest in the Vietnam War.The nice thing about this book is that even with a subject that I don't care for, it is told from an individual's perspective which can make or break any situation if told in the right way.Wolff comes through with this book too, by being very honest with his readers. He seems to be holding back a little more with this book than he did with his earlier memoir, but that appears to be more of a function of space and time considerations than of concealing information.Although there were things about his character that disappointed me, that made me like the book all the more due to it frankness.I hope that Mr. Wolff is working on a third memoir over the next phase of his life. I can't wait to read it."
3,A disappointment; pretty mundane.,"Wolff is a fine writer, and the book is certainly readable, but it added barely anything to my understanding of war, Vietnam, the soldier's life, etc. Frankly, I was disappointed, based on the previous work I'd read by him. Other Vietnam books, such as ""Chickenhawk"", ""The Things They Carried"" (the latter billed as fiction) and ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"" really put this one to shame, and I strongly recommend all of them, without reservation, to anyone who might be interested in this subject. This one you can skip."
4,Sony Shoulder Belt,"Belt is a little clumsy to use, because of it's design. It only has one connection point to the camera so it tends to spin and flop around. Not much can be done since the camera only has one point to connect a strap. Also, Sony should include a belt for their cameras, like they used to. It does work though, and there isn't much else that can be used on my camera."
5,Protects my Camcorder,"I bought this strap because I was concerned about dropping my camcorder or perhaps having it unintentionally knocked out of my hand when filming at a crowded event. I don't use it at all times, but when needed it has served me well."
2,Too much for a small camcorder,I bought this for my little Sony camcorder. It is too long and too big. I have a little camera case and the strap was taking up too much room. I took it off and went without one.
5,Blues de Kayes,"Someday I'm going to have to go to Kayes and hear the music on the streets. If Kar Kar's music is any indication, I'll be in for a good time. I thought I'd heard all the deepest blues till I heard Kar Kar. His guitar playing makes us realize that the people didn't start playing the blues on plantations in the American south, they started back on the savannas of Mali and continue from the streets of Bamako to Paris, and right here in California. By the way, if you ever get a chance to see Kar Kar play take it. I saw him in Berkeley and I'm still wondering how he gets all those notes out of his guitar."
4,I really like this product. I've tried just ...,"I really like this product. I've tried just about every mouthwash on the market -- some of them more than once! I found the Listerine Cool Mint a very refreshing mouthwash. It left my mouth tingly and clean feeling, yet it wasn't too strong. Some mouthwashes I've tried have been so strong that they actually seem to """"burn"""" your mouth. I'll continue to use the Listerine Mouthwash and recommend it highly. One other plus -- it's very competitively priced."
3,"great book, terrible printing",An excellent book that provides a concise review of diplomacy among the Great Powers during the period. This particular printing is not hard cover however and several pages were double printed or blurred in this edition.
2,Definitely out of date,"Time Out does a good job of detailing many options for what to do with yourself during your time off, but it is so woefully out of date that it mentions a few countries that are no longer in existence. It has very detailed information that must have been useful at the time it was written, but it can serve only as a stepping off point now. One would be better off going with something newer."
5,Huyen,"I love this book, its great if you want to knowabout the Tale of Kieu. However, I dilike the translation. I don't think they're right in some places. I don't see how they're translated from Vietnamese to English correctly. In some ways, they do not make sense."
1,A somewhat disturbing story,"This story is billed as being about growth and sounds like it's going to have some real content...the growth they are talking about isn't the spiritual or life learning sort of growth...it's physical growth...the tree grows and then is clipped into a shape the tree farmer...and then after it's been chosen to be a christmas tree and chopped down, it's then fashioned into a window. So what I read is, physically grow a certain way, let others physically change you so that you're acceptable...and then when you're no longer what they wanted you for, let them change you into something else...the lead charter is passive...not really a healthy message for children. There are so many wonderful stories in the Christmas genre, this is not one of them. I am returning this book."
1,Book review - not article,"This ""article"" was not what at all what I expected. Rather than being an article, it was really just a book review of Susan Fowler's book titled ""Web Application Design Handbook : Best Practices for Web-Based Software"". Whilst I wasn't expecting much for $5.95 I was expecting more than just a book review.Whilst the review is interesting, I would personally save your money and just read the editorial and customer reviews for this book which are free!Tania"
4,A Dentist Reviews This Product,"Polident is a good denture cleaning solution. It makes good on its claim to kill bacteria on the denture, as it has a mild bleach solution in it. Best to soak the dentures in the solution each night. This keeps the stain and ""smell"" of a dirty denture away. Never ever let a denture sit out on a nightstand without it being in water or denture cleaner, as the denture can dehydrate and warp."
5,Christmas In The Country... and Lovin' It!,"One of the best Country Christmas albums available.Track Listing:1. White Christmas - George Strait2. I'll Be Home For Christmas - Reba McEntire3. There's A New Kid In Town - Oakridge Boys4. Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow - Lee Greenwood5. Christmas At Our House - Barbara Mandrell6. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town - George Strait7. O Holy Night - Reba McEntire8. That's What I Like About Christmas - Oakridge Boys9. Christmas To Christmas (Loving You) - Lee Greenwood10. From Our House To Yours - Barbara Mandrell"
4,Most chapters are good...,Most chapters are very good. My interest is painting--I found that several chapters were just excellent instruction and tips-others were OK. Worth the purchase price to me...
3,"Promising, though the mix could be better","An entertaining live act, the debut album from Boston rockabilly band the Raging Teens falls a bit short of their fun live shows. Personally, I'd put the blame on either the mix or the mastering since the performances seem to be spirited enough. At 23 minutes and change, the album could have been a bit longer, too. Still, as a live act the band is tremendous and the next album will likely sound better."
3,Little Marines 1 Butchered,"Review for Little Marines Collection 2 Disc setI too grew up renting this movie over and over on VHS. They totally butchered this film with dubbed over music killing the original soundtrack! I read the reviews and decided to buy it anyway to see how it was changed. still same story, same good movie if you can live without the original music and (why the hell I don't know) the talent show with the dead friend Matt that was cut into a lil 30 second piece they made go well with this DVD version but vhs version was cooler with the bannanarama song! funny thing it mentions all the songs (original soundtrack) from the vhs version in the credits.I don't remember the music for Little Marines 2 but it seems they kept it the same.This DVD Set is OK but I recommend the VHS version with the original soundtrack for the first Little Marines"
4,Good reprint,"This book reprints several of the best essays from the editors' 1968 collection *Tolkien and the Critics,* combining them with several new essays by some of the best Tolkien scholars writing today. Together, they make a strong case for the strength of Tolkien's masterpiece on solid literary grounds (rebutting the main early critiques). It is very useful for my Philosophy and Fantasy course, and the papers are all accessible and interesting for the general reader. I can strongly recommend this book to all fans and literary critics alike."
4,Thought provoking views on Lord of the Rings,"I do not normally extend my reading of Tolkien criticism beyond that of Tom Shippey or Verlyn Flieger having come across a couple of rather woeful efforts at reviewing the Lord of the Rings. However, both these authors have contributed essays to this book, and I must say that all the essays here are fascinating and thought provoking. Even Patrick Grant's exploration via Jungian psychology (something I most certainly wouldn't normally be interested in) is quite fascinating. Basically, if you like the various works that Tom Shippey has put out on Tolkien or the Lord of the Rings, I think that you will find this book compelling reading."
4,Great critique of Tolkien's works,"This collection of essays is a great way to understand Tolkien's works in depth. I've read most of what Tolkien's wrote and have been working my way through the various critiques and analyses of his legendarium. Well-written, the essays give me things to think about and a reason to re-read the books."
1,No imagination was put into this.,"What a dissapointment! Sorma's Mirage of the East CD was such an incredible work of art, I've played it in the evening dozens of times. Then I bought this...It's the same tracks from other CD's but with a loud, continuous techno disco beat. The SAME techno beat, continuously, through the whole CD. To create this CD must have taken 4 or 5 minutes; program their other songs, turn on a boom box, and come back an hour later with a finished product."
3,Somewhat far-fetched...,"David Jason is entertaining as a thief with a certain sense of justice. His victims are all criminals and deserve what they get at Des's capable hands. But this series does not have the punch of ""A Touch of Frost"" and falls short of delivering a believable story. Some of the escape stunts that the main character pulls off are beyond David Jason's physical capabilities and left me shaking my head. With that said, I would not hesitate to buy another installment of the series."
2,two stars,"Rough Diamond did not live up to my expectations. The story was predictable and it seemed that I had seen this all before. There were no surprises unlike ""Frost"" the supporting characters were not believable or interesting.If you are a David Jason fan watch ""Open All Hours"", ""The Darling Buds"" or ""A touch Of Frost"". Rough Diamond did not make the cut."
5,inspector frost turns criminal!,"Having seen all the Inspector Frost DVD's I was needing a David Jason ""fix""......""Rough Diamond"" was perfect. 4 episodes of fun plots, a few twists to keep you on your toes. Loved seeing Mr. Jason in the beautiful clothes befitting a man about town.....then all the disguises and ""uniforms""....It was delightful to me, and my friends. Love Jack Frost, you'll love ""Rough Diamond"""
4,Nice Buy!!,"I did a little research on the seller at first by reading plenty of reviews. I don't normally buy from private sellers but i took a chance. As it turned out, the product was in great shape & played flawlessly. So i have no complaints. The buyer is happy & so should the seller. Thanks!!"
2,"Bunch of Classics, background sound ruins cd though","I am a HUGE warp brothers fan, and I anticipated this album greatly. A great compilation of Warp Brothers classics, but they played a crowd type ""sound"" in the background on loop. Its so easy to tell its not a real crowd, it ruined the CD. Too bad, could have been an incredible album."
5,Outstanding,This one of the best CD's I've listen to. The bass is great!!! The breaks are incredible!!! Best purchase I've made in a long time.Mike Gorycki
2,A Fantasy Scenario of Current Events,"If you like a book that is big on details of military weapons and short on plot and characters, this is for you. It has a slight resemblance to Tom Clancy, but Clancy has better plots and believable characters. Here, we have terrorists in submarines sinking ships, including a US Navy nuclear submarine and an aircraft carrier, in the narrow Straight of Juan de Fuca leading into Seattle, But the large number of well-armed terrorists that man the submarines are killed by five Special Forces soldiers led by a General. As a combat veteran, I had trouble with how five men could defeat such a big crowd of bad guys, but I guess our guys are supermen. The characters are flat, but there is plenty of action."
1,Such a dissapointment,This shampoo and conditioner did absolutely nothing for my unwanted warm tones and brassiness. I can't believe how much they charged me for a product that did not work. Really the only plus I can see about this product is its low pH. Do not waste your money.
2,Good for parakeets but too destructable for even a small parrot.,"The structure of the toy was maintained by thin plastic cords. Lucky the Red-Lored Amazon bit through these in five seconds flat. He did really enjoy spilling little beads all over. (At least he enjoyed watching me crawl around picking them up before the dog ate them.) Then, it took him five minutes at least to break the central top in half. On the bright side, I got several other equally fun, and slightly more rugged toys from this company also, and they have great prices. Good company overall. Buy several toys from them at once to save on combined shipping."
3,Ok toy,Made well but not good for large birds. The wood should be harder for large bird toys. While it was intact she loved it
3,Prelude to Infinity was disappointing,"I did not like this CD nearly as well as his CD ""The Infinite"" which I rated 5 stars. I was disappointed with ""Prelude to Infinity."""
5,A masterpiece,This is a masterpiece. The sounds are so angelic and beautiful. I have other CD's from his collection but this one is my favorite. Great for relaxing and meditating.
1,I was sent the wrong CD. Beware of this vendor.,"The music is not my complaint. The issue is that the wrong Robert Haig Coxon CD was in the package. I ordered ""Prelude to Infinity"". The CD itself says ""Prelude to Infinity"". The music on the ""Prelude to Infinity"" is actually ""Crystal Silence 3 - The inner voyage"". That is an album that was recorded in 1991.Beware of this buyer. I am rating this CD a 1* because it was either put together by mistake or by fraudulent activity."
2,printing,"I recently received a copy of this book and found the quality of the prints very poor indeed. Printed in China, they are grainy, at times out of focus and with limited colors on some at least. A few plates are convincing but not many. This a book reminiscent of the art books printed in the sixties and seventies with analogue printing technology. Given the quantum leaps in digital printing techniques during the last ten years, this is just unforgivable. Disappointed that Tom Rockwell let this pass as a book on his father's wonderful work."
5,A fantastic guide to the ideas and thoughts of a great philosopher,"Even though I do not agree with this philosopher's stand on war and socialism; nevertheless, as a free thinking individual, I appreciate Mr. Russell's genius and sharp wit. This 336 page tome covers a wide range of material with detailed comments on numerous topics. This book is organized in such a way that makes it a great read. Just look up the topic and it gives you the page number of the quote. This book has taken the comments and quotations from a wide variety of Russell's writings. Some of the topics include: Aggression, America, Anarchy. Anti-Semitism, Artistotle, Asia, belief, religion, books, courage, death, democracy, economics, and numerous other topics. This short review cannot do justice to this very interesting and informative book.In conclusion, This book is for anyone who has an intellectual curiousity.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Never Trust a Politician)."
1,Ripoff,"Not a bargain at all. Bottle was travel size, much smaller than I expected. 3.2 oz is really small! Purchase at your pharmacy or elsewhere, not here."
1,Over priced,You can buy a bigger size and cheaper at Target or Walmart for the same price (including tax). Here is totally over priced.
2,"Total waste of money, NOT RECOMMENDED.","okay first of all i used this product for 3 weeks... 2-3 times a daymy dentist recommended me this toothpaste to help me reduce gingivitis... so far i have not noticed a single reduction in thatworse yet it even helped the production of tartar on my teeth which my dentist also noticed.. i have a good oral hygiene habbit and i do brush my teeth 2 or 3 times a day to fight off plaque and cavities.this mouthwash is a hard abrasive.. it has alcohol which burns my mouth.. there is no need for alcohol in mouthwashand it leaves a funny after taste which is bad.i dont know why parents would allow their kids to rinse their mouths with a cancer causing agentoh its true alcohol in mouthwash is cancer productive, and by that i mean it can cause mouth cancer...we drink alcohol we dont swish it around for 30 seconds or upto a minute.. its totally different than drinking"
5,breath taking,"Listerine is the best product i know of that can do it all.You know after a good brush the icing on the cake is some good ol Listerine.And With this particular Listerine your'e good for 24 hours,now how great is that."
5,Great Book to Have and to Keep,-Beautiful pictures and wonderful presentation-Clear step by step instructions-Great tips on selecting and arranging flowers-Excellent floral arrangements-Great range of floral designs
1,"small book, in content and value",The author tries to exploit his name as author of the PGP softwareto write a book on the subject too. Unofrtuntely the book is ...insufficient. I found other books on the same subject much betterthan this one.
1,*** Buyer Beware - This company is not selling what they describe here. ***,"Ultralast UL-NP60 Camcorder/Digital Camera Battery Equivalent to Fuji NP-60 - SOLD BY EFORCITYI bought these a few days ago and needed some NP-60 batteries with 1200mAh capacity (as this ad sells).Package arrived and the batteries shipped are very different from the picture AND the description.Batteries shipped are 1000mAh batteries made by another manufacturer.I have told them the picture doesn't matter, but the battery mAh capacity most certainly does matter to me.Thus far e-mails to this company are offering another free battery (that is too small capacity wise) or a small percentage of the purchase price refunded (yay, getting the *wrong* thing on sale!).I am awaiting a solution that works for me and gets me either the batteries I ordered OR a full refund if they cannot fill the order correctly.Sign me Bait & Switched by Eforcity.CAVEAT EMPTOR! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,DOES NOT WORK ON JEEP CHEROKEE,"DO NOT BUY if you are purchasing this for a Jeep Cherokee. Amazon claims that it will work on your vehicle, but it won't. Not even a close fit."
1,Bb Alto?,I do not believe that this seller knows what he or she is talking about. There is no such thing as a Bb alto clarinet. This is a picture of a Bb Soprano clarinet. I'm not sure if I would trust a seller of clarinets if he or she does not even know the correct name.
3,Great starter for assessing in the beginning of the year,"I used 2 of the rubrics, one for writing, and one for spelling, they are great to use with primary grades, and the students did feel empowered assessing their own writing.I dont know if I could use it all year, its good for seasonal assessment, i.e. beginning of the year, mid-year, and year-end.Its the first rubrics book Ive used and purchased so its a great beginner, very easy to use. I wouldve liked to see more in the way of using them regularly."
1,Broke,This product broke the first time I used it. Not sure is it was me or the puller. I will buy a metal one next time. It's not a toy?
4,Magdelena is Very Funny!,"These books are worth reading for Magdelena. The books are told in the first person directly from her mind and mouth, and she is uproariously funny! The mystery in this book is not very difficult, but the trip that the reader takes to get there is such fun. In this book, the Penn-Dutch inn is taken over by a Hollywood crew for filming a movie. Even Magdelena gets involved as an actress in this one. But before they get much footage shot, a body shows up in the barn. Magdelena has to set out to find the killer (mostly because she's ""suspecto numero uno"", according to the less than brightest light that represents the law in Hernia.) It's great fun to read these books and to follow Magdelena through her life and acquaintances."
3,Filming at the inn.,"When Magdelena Yoder rents out the inn to a movie crew filming a horror movie she ends up with much more than expected. The town has tampled her yard in the hopes of getting a bit part, she and her sister are acting in the movie, and there is a corpse in the barn. As almost everyone in turn becomes the prime suspect Magdelena's logic once again amazes.The characters are always entertaining in this series, but the filming of a movie was just a little more than I could stretch my imagination to acccept. The setting is as charming as usual and I look forward to reading more in this series."
4,Useful for Gorrillapod,"I wanted a compact head for the heavy duty Gorrillapod (the slr model). This one has smooth operation, sturdier that you would think for its size. I use it with a digital SLR. Good value."
5,Great tripod head for slider,"It's great. A bit smaller than I had expected but still a good solid, sturdy head. There are some reviews that say it does not pan, that is not true. It does pan, you just have to tighten the base down to the bolt on your tripod. I tightened it down with some vise grips. I use it on a Konova 23"" slider. I am replacing one handle with a shorter bolt so it doesn't bump into the slider. Great build."
3,Good But,"The product is very sturdy. the only reason I am giving it average score is because the items description lists it as a product with three way movement with each one having its own separate lock. However there is only two adjustment handles/locks. One for the vertical movement from landscape to portrait position and the second handle controls both the up/down as well as the horizontal panning motion. I also did not find it very necessary to have a large handle to go from portrait to landscape. Should just be a knob type lock. But again some people would find it convenient in not having to handle their gear that is mounted. There is always two sides to the story, I needed three of them instead."
2,Paid way to much for poor quality tools in kit,I was very disappointed in finding out that the clamp meter in the kit is worth $30 so if you expect to make a living with the tools as well as need them for your hvac classes then I suggest you wait till school starts and get the instructors suggestion. A fellow classmate bought a clamp meter for $20 at Harbor Freight Tools store in town...sure it's junk quality but at least he didn't over pay for the junk tool...like I did.
3,A perfect component to the motion picture,"Based on the movie's original, uncut screenplay. Without giving too much away, The Sword and the Sorcerer delves deeper into each character's history, and helps to fill in many of the plot holes from the 1982 motion picture. Reading this novel after watching the movie will give you a much clearer sense of this little-known cult classic.If you're a fan of the movie, or if you're buying the DVD, I highly recommend picking up this book."
5,Beautiful Music,"There is really no other way to describe this music other than beautiful. It is full of soul at times, and light and pretty at oters. You cannot regret buying this CD for its musical value. It is also authentic Indian music made by Indians in the spirit of their tradition. You'll regret not having it!"
5,wet and wild fun,I'd never used lube before so i did my research to see which type was the best and this product came up. so i went ahead and bought it and used it the night it came. And i have to say that it definitely gets the job done : ) not sticky or anything and cleans up real easily. would recommend it to anyone.
3,"Decent lubricant, but gets a little sticky after a while...","My wife and I enjoyed this product well enough. It lubricates well, is clear, and (as long as you don't use too much) it isn't messy. Any extra does get to be a little sticky (like any that ends up running onto the inner thighs). So be ye warned. But we are happy with it. It works well and is a good price for it."
5,All time classic at a great price,"Got this using Amazon prime shipping for half the cost of what CVS charges -- a great deal. I use this lubricant between my cheeks, and complement the KY there with using Jo lubricant on my toys. (see my other reviews). This is the ageless, classic lubricant for your fun times. Water soluble, easy to clean, no fuss."
1,the lube your grandparents used,"We have moved beyond the sticky, slimy lube. Even KY has there own better lube. Try something like ID glide, or the KY intrigue, although that has to be reapplied more often."
1,Kills all feeling,This is not the same stuff that comes in the smaller 1 oz tubes... This stuff basically removes all sensation. I wish I could return this item for the lubricant!
1,Too Sticky and Gooey,I don't care for this product at all and threw it in the trash. The goop is too gooey and sticky. Pure vaseline or creamy vaseline works much better and is a lot cheaper.
4,Does the job,"Good price for a product that does what it's supposed to. I suppose there are better quality lubes out there, but I refuse to spend $20 a tube..."
5,Clear and concise,"As a psychotherapist, I am always interested in self-help books that might be valuable to myself and my clients. This book, along with Scott Wexzler's book, ""Living with the Passive-Agressive Man,"" are the two books I continually recommend to those people who feel angry and ""crazy"" in relationships and yet don't quite understand what is going on. This book is especially valuable because not only does the author define passive-aggressive behavior, he gives concrete ideas of how to constructively recognize and address it. Also, he provides a realistic assessment of the effects p/a has on a relationship and the difficulty one will have in recognizing and disengaging from this anger. Well written and easy to follow, this book is a valuable asset to anyone caught up in the tentacles of passive aggressive, or hidden, anger."
1,"Poorly written, disorganized","I found this book to be poorly written, disorganized, and contains some info that is just plain wrong. The title promises a lot. Had I known that the author was a pop tv psychologist/politician, my expectations would have been suitable lowered. The anecdotal (too many, too long, and too specific with no general conclusions drawn)lessons are just common sense. Read an excellent pop-psych book, like The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem. Then read this mess, and difference in quality will be glaringly obvious."
1,Vague and not very useful,"I found this book to be full of fluff and not much substance. It meanders all over the place and, rather than address passive aggressiveness head-on, is a general book about anger and conflict in relationships. I didn't learn anything new."
2,Mostly filler,"Not enough practical exercises to overcome anything. I was left with the feeling that the act of overcoming passive-aggression was hardly taken into account, and what was more important to the author was that he proved he could illustrate examples of passive-aggression."
3,Listerine left my mouth feeling very refreshed and ...,"Listerine left my mouth feeling very refreshed and clean tasting. The only thing I didn't like about this particular one was that it left a medicinal taste in my mouth after using it. A different flavored one would be much better. Otherwise, I liked the product; it did what it was intended to. I would recommend it to family and friends."
2,It's not a pleasant-tasting product. While the packaging ...,"It's not a pleasant-tasting product. While the packaging and bottle are attractive and the product labels are informative, the mouthwash tasted awful. I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family because there are many superior products available."
5,Effective!,"I hate using mouthwash but I do it because it's beneficial. I hate using painful mouthwash (hello Listerine) but it's worth it because I find this mouthwash really works better than any other I've tried.The ingredients hurt but it's worth enduring for half a minute. I find that when I use Listerine my teeth feel smooth & clean a great deal longer than if I just brush.I've used other mouth rinses for breath protection, but I use Listerine for tooth & gum protection. Seems to be really working & it takes care of any minor gum irritation or inflammation. Scary stuff but good stuff. :)The fresh flavor is very nice. I have yet to try other flavors..."
3,"I really liked the clean, fresh feeling my ...","I really liked the clean, fresh feeling my mouth had after using the Cool Mint Listerine. It does get rid of my bad breath, but that antiseptic taste of regular Listerine still comes through a bit. Overall, I'd probably recommend Cool Mint Listerine to friends, because I believe the Listerine family of products does kill germs and also heals minor mouth irritation."
5,Expectations Were Met,The Fasco blower met all expectations. I was most pleased that the instalation was very simple. The whole process took about 45 minutes. I have been running the blower for about three weeks. The unit is quiet and has not had any problems.
5,I wish I could give it six stars!,There should be more books like this out there. Col. Seymour was an important part of the revival of the Western Mystery Tradition and deserves to be remembered!
2,internet 101 for the fine artist,I received the 2004 version and the information was dated. Be sure and get the latest version. Fortunately I did not pay very much for my copy.
3,So-So,"I got this book cus i am some what of a collector of cookbooks, and all I have to say is that it is so so. I own alot of the food netowrks chefs books, and i found that all the recipes that are in this book, are in the books i already own, so if u own Rachael Ray, or Giada, or Tyler, or Bobby, and Paula books I wouldnt buy this, it is nice to see all of them in one, but like i said it is so so."
5,Memories,I am a Dutch guy who lived in the USA for 5 years.Food Network made me go out of my mind and having a book with the receipes of the best chefs makes me happy.AND the receipes are just wonderful.
1,Poorly Presented Procedures,"The only star I give this book is for the interesting comments from the collection of chefs presented in the book. Which, by the way, were the only pages printed large enough to read without scrutiny. I have returned this book and cannot recommend it for anyone to purchase without first picking up a copy and opening it. An eagle would need a magnigying glass to read the fine print of every recipe. Using such a tiny font for directions is an unkind joke on those who purchased this book with the intent of actually using it. I wonder if the Food Network ""favorites"" had an opportunity to see how their work was presented; I doubt even they would purchase such a useless cookbook."
1,Waste of Money,"I love to cook. I am an excellent cook. I am also a huge fan of the Food Network. I am not in the least bit however, a fan of this cookbook. The one and only redeeming part of this cookbook is the interesting short little interviews at the beginning of each different chef's section. Apart from that, the recipes were not worth the paper they were printed on. Why? Well, unless you are a dedicated seafood nut, then the majority of these recipes will not be to your taste. No less than 80 percent of the recipes in this collection are fish based. Finally, although I am impressed with what all these talented folks can do, I do not personally need recipes that I cannot ever fathom using. How about some down home normal recipes with a wee bit of flair? Being a foody, I am desperately disappointed in this cookbook and glad that I bought it on ebay cheaply. I will certainly be re-selling it today!"
3,I lap up all Food Network books...,Or I should say I used to. I bought this one without really looking inside because I had had such good experiences in the past with FN books. I haven't made one recipe out of this book. I was also dismayed to find repeat recipes found in the other cookbooks by the same chefs (I already owned)! It was like a compilation of a few recipes from already published cookbooks.If you want a good FN cookbook...buy the one that the people behind the scenes put together...it's called Food Network Kitchens Cookbook. It's much better than the celebrity chef compilation.
1,Good Not Great,"While it is interesting to have the chefs gathered together, I found the Food Network Kitchens recipes to be better written and better tasting (so far). I would suggest buying one of the Food Network Kitchen books and a cookbook from whichever of these chefs you like."
5,gift purchase,"Bought this as a gift for my neice's bridal shower. She had it on her Kohls registry but it was listed there as unavailable. Bought it here, came in good shape and quickly."
4,very pleased,"I purchased it for my son for xmas and he was very pleased. It came invery good condition and I was very happy. Thank you, joanne"
1,Disappointing,I wish I would have previewed this item in a store before buying. The recipes aren't very good or interesting. It's better to just download the recipes you want from the food network website. I will put it out at the next neighborhood garage sale.
5,"Oh, The Variety...",I love this book. Being able to have the varied styles and types of cooking in one place not only saves me money but helps me determine my own style of cooking.I've only tried a couple of the recipes so far but they've been do-able and delicious.
3,not that great,I was not at all impressed with this book. I have had it quite some time and haven't used it once. Many of the ingredients I can't even get. I live in a very small town and we just don't have access to alot of that stuff. I wouldn't recommend this one.
2,over the top receipes,I returned this book- it did not have any recipes that my family would eat.From now on when I want a recipe i will just Google it
5,Perfect for taking walks with your little one!!,"This was the perfect carrier for us - a little expensive, but worth it! Our little girl always seemed very comfortable as a newborn and then as she grew we turned her around so she could see the world when we went out for ""adventures."" It also has great support for the person carrying baby and looks nice too.I'll admit, I've never used a sling, but this carrier made me feel very confident. My baby was well fastened in and away we would go."
2,"The taste of the product started off okay, ...","The taste of the product started off okay, but left me with an odd taste in my mouth (I usually rinsed my mouth with water after using the Biotene). And frankly, it's hard to tell how this mouthwash was effecting the health of my mouth, without having checked with a dentist at the start and end of the Test Drive, but I wish I knew. This product doesn't feel as effective as plain old mouthwash, but maybe it's better for my mouth, since it has no alcohol."
2,Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash,"I've used mine for about a week and the verdict isn't in yet. The idea of this mouthwash is to coat the inside of the mouth rather than serve as a mouthwash. Thus, its designed to be a film coating product. It clearly states in the ingrediants it has oil in it and Alo vera as well.I don't think it sticks that long. I almost get as much out of just using mouth wash, brushing my teeth and then chewing sugar free gum."
2,"I found the mouthwash to have an oily, ...","I found the mouthwash to have an oily, waxy texture that wasn't very appealing. The taste itself was pleasant, but I dreaded using it because of its strange, residual feeling. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh, but the effects didn't last very long. It wasn't altogether unpleasant, but I don't think I'd purchase it."
2,Just doesn't last,"Biotene has a great flavor, slightly minty and very mild. Someone else said it was ""oily"". I wouldn't say that, but it is slightly viscous, slightly thicker than water but not like a syrup. Maybe as thick as a strong cup of hot cocoa. I imagine it has to be somewhat viscous to lubricate your mouth. And it does lubricate, pretty darn well for a few minutes. I doesn't last very long though, maybe a half-hour max. If it lasted longer it would be great.If you're desperate then give this a try. It can't hurt, and maybe it will last longer for you than it did for me. They also make a spray version which might be better because you could take it with you and reapply as needed:Biotene Moisturizing Mouth Spray 1.5 fl oz (45 ml)."
5,an excellent mouthwash,"My dentist recently gave me Biotène mouthwash to try. He said that it would help fight dry mouth--and it does! It's worth the price you pay for it because it truly does fight dry mouth. This is helpful when you have a dry mouth because of medicine you take or chemotherapy you must have--or any other reason.Biotène mouthwash uses a natural approach to keeping my mouth more comfortable--it uses ""bio-active enzymes"" to make my mouth much less dry. Biotene reduces plaque and bacteria buildup in your mouth, too; and I like that. It also contains calcium and a dash of peppermint for a pleasant taste; and that's wonderful!This mouthwash is perfectly safe; but I DON'T swallow it. I don't recommend you do that, either! If you have questions ask your dentist before using this product.Overall, if you have dry mouth for any reason--like I do--get this and try it out. I predict you'll be quite satisfied. You can order it here or you can find it in a drugstore."
1,This stuff is toxic!,"The second ingredient is propylene glycol, which is basically antifreeze!Google it and prepare to be shocked that this company put this toxic ingredient into a product that goes inside our mouths. As soon as it does it goes into the bloodstream, not to mention the smalll amounts we swallow.Unbelievable that this company can get away with this. The FDA is worthless."
4,Worth the money,"My hygienist introduced this product and I was happy to acknowledge it does work quite well as it was advertised. It keeps your mouth moist, soft and pleasant throughout the night. What a pleasure to wake up in the morning feeling so refreshed. I would highly recommend it to everybody who needs this booster. The money is more than well spent."
1,Makes my dry mouth worse,So glad (and sorry) to see someone else has a problem with Bio-Tene. Not sure why but it makes my mouth DRIER than it was before I used it.
4,I really liked this mouthwash. It wasn't as ...,I really liked this mouthwash. It wasn't as harsh and didn't burn like a lot of other mouthwashes. It was very smooth and the taste was great. I liked the idea of the added calcium. A really great product! Try it!
5,Loved it since its original release in 1972,"It was the summer before my wife and I married and Seven Separate Fools became our soundtrack for many days and nights ever after. This album touches all of the familiar notes of our emotions. It is thoughtful (Black and White), plaintive (Going in Circles), and sometimes just plain fun (Tulsa Turnaround). We're from Kentucky, so Three Dog's revved-up version of My Old Kentucky Home (ended with a semi-serious humming of Will the Circle Be Unbroken?) is one of our favorites. If we ever had a criticism for this album, it was that the guys didn't tap their fountain of creative genius a little longer during its creation to give us a few more cuts to satisfy our craving for more."
4,Remastered?,"Warning! While this is an excellent album by Three Dog Night, I can't find any indication that it has been remastered. It is listed on this Amazon site as having come out in the mid-90's when the back is copyrighted 1988 - identical to the non-remastered disc I bought around that time (including the same generic back-cover that MCA put on all their cheap cds in the 80s). I have suggested this same warning for ""Harmony."""
5,a must have cd,This cd spans the classics iv music career. If you grew up in the 60's and still enjoy listening to the music from that era this cd is well worth the price.
3,It's probably just me....,"It's probably just me...but I won't be a happy owner of a Classics IV CD until I get their album ""Song"" on CD."
5,Great Job!!!,"In my review of the other Classics IV ""Best of"" package, I complained about the lousy sound quality and wondered why there wasn't a Legendary Masters Series edition of this great group. Well, HERE IT IS! This is everything a Classics IV fan could ask for. A terrific remastering job and rare cuts long out of print. The sound quality is excellent. Don't waste your money on the other EMI ""Very Best of"" CD with the awful sound quality; spend a few extra dollars and hear the Classics IV as they deserve to be heard. You won't be disappointed."
4,Helpful piece for families who have children in hospice...,"This is a sweet easy read, not meant to be theological discourse for academic classroom. I have given and will continue to give many copies to those who are struggling with loss and disappointments. Chaplain Sallye A Hardy"
2,Not a good read,"Somewhat disappointed by this bookThe Author makes some suggestions of why we suffer, and a few I can agree with, but many are purely his thoughts without merit - stating things like "" perhaps God can't control certain things in this world"" -it's very easy for anyone to pick and choose select versus from the Bible to make most any point they want to convey, and the world needs to be very careful of this these days ...but taking in the whole context of The Bible, it clearly tells us he can and does.Suffering in life is a great mystery, not only to Christians but to everyone, and I'm sorry to say you won't find much help by reading this book....I would suggest a book to help you with your faith, so you will believe that God does control everything and you can completely put your troubles in his hands."
5,"Killer, behind you...my bloodlust defies my all my needs","Ooooh yea, I've done it AGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIINNN!!This is My favorite Iron Maiden album. Paul D'ianno really shines on such tracks as Killers and Wrathchild.Steve Harris on the bass, on, like, every single track, is completely amazing. If you've never listened to an album specifically for good bass, let it be this one. Also, Maiden's first, self-titled, album is another wonderful display of Harris' bass playing.If you're like Maiden during the Dickenson days, you will love this album."
5,Worth It For The Cover Alone!,"A great album with the best artwork I've ever seen, even to this day!It was the reason I picked up this album. I'd never heard of Maiden at all, but thought the artwork by Derek Riggs was phenomninal! And it only got better from there.I later grew to appreicate Maiden for their music. This album has a classical, punk feel to it, with a dash of metal thrown in. It would lay the foundation for greatness for years to come. And it's still a great album."
3,"average album, very inconsistant though","I really though that ""killers"" had some shinning moments on it but was ultimately muddled over all by filler. there are some really good songs here though such as ""wrathchild"" ""murders in the rue morge"" ""killers"" ""gehngis khan"" ect but it is too uneven for my taste, and some parts sound like they sacraficed creativity and songwritting for speed. it does deserve a respectable 3 stars though, because it does show the eventually greatness that would become iron maiden. they would go on to put out masterpiece albums after this. like i said before though, this albums inconsistancey kills it for me, this simpley isn't as solid as say ""piece of mind"" or ""power slave"" but it shows good effort and maturity from there first album."
2,Not very good as far as Iron Maiden goes,"I was very dissappointed in this album as compared to their records with Bruce Dickenson. The music wasn't bad, but Paul D'ianno doesn't hold a candle to his successor. Definitely not high on my list off favorite CDs."
2,"well, I don't know what to say...","I was so very disapointed, I never heard of Iron Maiden before, but this album ain't good. I should give it one star, but because of 'Wrathchild', i give it 2 stars. Don't buy this one, buy other album of Iron Maiden, cause I know some other IM-albums that are very good. BUT THIS ONE SUCKS!! It really isn't so good as some reviewers say it is. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
5,This is real metal,"Wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album. Its just that darn good of a song. But hey, the whole album is good. the title track is brutally awesome, especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd (iron maiden box set). and murders in the rue morgue is another classic. then there is drifter, and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan (who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort). Maybe not as good as their debut album, but still a masterpeice of an album."
5,Love it!,"I love it! But it is ""Treat Her Right"", so what could be bad? I was missing this from my collection and glad to have it!!Seller was great! Easy purchase, shipped quickly! A+"
3,I agree with D. Kastin's three star review....,"This cd is merely an appetizer for those who wish to discover mediterranean world music. Hopefully, this cd will propel you to buy the individual artist's recordings. Don't just stop with this cd! I agree that Cristina Branco's ""Fado"" style of music is missing here and the music of Portugal should not be overlooked in a world music compilation. I discovered Calic and Madredeus and a host of wonderful world music artists from the site cdroots.com. I would recommend any person desiring to discover world music, to stop by this site. Amazon doesn't carry a lot of the artists that you will find on this site. So, buy this cd to get a taste of the mediterranean, but by all means continue to explore and enjoy the vast array!"
4,Another awesome collection by Putumayo,Putumayo is really the premier world music CD producer. This album ranks up there as one of their best with tons of Spanish and Greek music to help you tune absolutely everything else out!
1,What a disappointment,I have LOVED all her other books but she has missed the mark here:1. First person point of view2. Trailer park3. Liberty is a child for too much of the book
2,Just read the end,"This book is all back story and really doesn't start until about 50-75 pages from the end. Save you time, read the end and be done with it."
2,Don't buy this because you like Kleypas' historicals....,"This book was such a bummer. I have read all of Kleypas' books prior to this...and this was a HUGE disappointment. I really don't like the first half of the book talking about her adolescence, and honestly, it wasn't as steamy as her historicals. I would classify this as a work of FICTION, but not as a romance. And a book being written in the first person seems akward to Kleypas...I'm not dissing the author...I absolutely love her...but it seems that historicals are not her thing. If you like contemporaries...and are not looking for a Kleypas style book...this would be good. I think it's getting harder and harder to find a good steamy contemporary that compares to the historicals. If anyone knows of a good one, let me know...cause this definitely isn't it!"
4,If you like romance you will like Lisa Kleypas,"I have just recently discovered Lisa Kleypas. I first read Smooth Talking Strangerand realized this was a third book of a series. I enjoyed it so much I went onAmazon and ordered the first two, Sugar Daddy and Blue Eyed Devil.I enjoyed all three. There is a lot of humor and romance. I couldn't put themdown.Although I live in the South, our weather has been quite cold. It was a perfecttime to cozy up and get lost in a good romance.At first I thought Sugar Daddy was a little slow and wasn't sure I was going to likeit. But then I realized you had to really know the history of Hardy and Libertyand the story really came together.I am partial to modern day books more than historical romance. In researching LisaKleypas I noticed most of her book dealt with historical romanaces and thereforeI didn't read them. I hope she does more modern day books also.Karen, SC"
5,LOVED IT!,"I love her historical books....so this one was a gamble, but I loved it! Started reading it at 10 pm, thinking I'd read a chapter or two and go to bed. I stayed up til 2 am, even though I had to wake up at 6 am. I couldn't put it down. Her characters are well-formulated and intriguing. I rooted for Liberty the whole book! Great ending. A real page-turner."
2,No Juice,"This book started off with an interesting story even though I am not a huge fan of the first person format. Liberty wasn't old enough to drive until almost 100 pages in and the book with large print was just over 300 pages! This story could have been beautiful about leaving your roots and then coming back. It was a bit cliched as well. Ugly duckling, swan, trailer part etc...I could not finish this book, I skipped ahead to the end to be able to see how it ended.I am a big Lisa Kleypas fan, after I read my first book, I finished them all pretty quickly."
5,Kleypas knows what she is doing!,"Another hit from Kleypas. This book had a young girl, who starts out with nothing and ends up with a whole lot. When she is young, her mom and her move to Welcome, Texas. She meets Hardy, instantly falling for him. However, he pushes her away. Her mother dates, and ends up with another girl, Carrington. Liberty seems more attatched to the sister than the mother.Something horrible happens, and Liberty becomes an adult in a blink of an eye. However, she doesn't let anything get her down. She ends up meeting the man of her dreams, only to have Hardy come back. Who will she choose?? Find out how it all unfolds and more!!! Can't wait to read Blue-Eyed Devil. I have it sitting here just waiting to be read!"
2,Couldn't get through this one,"The previous reviewer is right on the mark with her comment that it is questionable whether this book belongs in the romance genre. The romance kicks in at the end of the book as almost an after-thought. The writing isn't strong enough to be a literary coming of age story, so it's just kind of hanging out there as a big question mark."
3,a decent vacation read,"i want to preface this review with i went to hawaii for 3 weeks and finished the books i brought in the first week and and there was slim pickins at the country store. ok here it goes...this book is predictable. there is a little sexy parts that seem forced, repetitive and unneeded. kleypas seems to take her time to develop the story in the beginning and middle which but then it quickly concludes. almost seems like she ran out of gas and wanted to end it. if this were a movie i would say it wasn't the best but it was entertaining - you know the kind right?"
4,"Very nice ""gentle"" contemporary","I judge books based on their ""re-readability"" - I would re-read this one. It's nice (and unusual) to read a contemporary with little or no violence, no sexual abuse, only a very few F words thrown in, etc. But it's also very REAL. There's no villain in it - except maybe just life in general. This Kleypas 1st person read is a very ""sweet"" story of a girl growing up and finding happiness after a lifetime of hardship. It takes a while for the ""romance"" to kick in - but it's good when it finally gets there. You end up rooting for Liberty and hoping she makes the right choices."
3,It was just so-so for me,"I am a big fan of Lisa Kleypas and love all her books. I was really looking forward to reading her latest book. However, I didn't think it was up to her usual standards. I wasn't crazy about how it was written from a first person voice point of view. I wished I read from the guy's point of view and see what he felt. Also, more than half the book was about when she was a child/teenager and more history of Texas, and the romance did not begin until more than half way through the book. The romance part was fine, but I wish I was able to read the guy's thoughts and feelings. I felt the romance wasn't deep or detailed enough. Otherwise it was okay, and this won't keep me from reading her next books."
2,I wouldn't read anymore books by this author...,I wouldn't read any more books by this author if I didn't know what she was capable of writing. I really did not like this book. I have read all her other books and have loved them. It was a poor read.
1,Kleypas should stick to historicals,How does that happen?? An amazing writer can change genre and become less than average. I will NEVER buy another contemporary book from this author again.
3,Truely Disappointed,"I made the mistake of reading Blue Eyed Devil before I read Sugar Daddy and so I knew who the main character was going to end up with. It was a big mistake because she didn't meet him until what seemed like the end of the book. The story line had great potential for a hot and heavy boy meets girl, boy doesn't like girl, boy realizes that girl is everything he every wanted but it didn't quite make it. I had to struggle to get through this book. I kept feeling like come on all ready! The first 3/4 of this book was about Liberty the early years. Then when the romance begins it's rushed and done... This book was like that guy you had a crush on for a really long time that finally ask you out and he turns out to be really boring or just a big let down!"
3,Not tasty enough,"Liberty Jones grew up in a trailer, with her beloved mother, who did not always love wisely. There's a lot of time and detail spent on the years 14-18, and a lot of attention given to Hardy Cates as a romantic figure. And then in the last 70 pages or so, Liberty is suddenly 24, her sister is 8, and she moves into a millionares home to be his personal assistant.It's told in the first person and I guess that's why the second romance with Gage didn't work as well for me. He may have been very aware of her, but we only get her perceptions and she only notices him 50 pages towards the end.I liked this book, it was by no means a wall banger, but it felt oddly rushed towards the end. I think it was weighted too heavily towards her early years and there should have been more time and attention given to the later ones, to make this a really outstanding book. That being said, Liberty has a very clear voice and I enjoyed spending time with her."
1,SUGAR DADDY - SOUR FOR ME,"I felt it in my bones that this was going to be a disappointment to me. I have read all LK's Victorian romances and that is why I read her.The banter was gone. The smiles for me were gone. And I just cannot get into a first person because I feel it leaves no room to get 'into' the personality and thoughts of the other characters.All my favorite authors have been going to what 'sells' today and I for one am disappointed. I am an Abuse Evaluator and usually want these lighter books for a pick-me-up emotionally, knowing that love and romance still exist even in someone's active imagination.Too bad, Miss Kleypas. Here's a disappointed reader. Next time, it's the library for me."
5,Gage and Liberty,"This was a good read, and a good intro into Blue Eyed Devil which I read first. I think I would have liked a little more interaction between Gage and Liberty, for instance a whole chapter dedicated to New Years which apparently is when she got pregnant."
4,"Great ""Novel""-But if your looking for a typical Kleypas romance, this isn't it","When I heard Lisa Kleypas was writing a contemporary I was disappointed. I have read all but 2 of her books and love them. I couldn't wait for a new one. Then I started reading ""Sugar Daddy"" and was disappointed at first. It didn't follow the same formula as her other books and it took forever to get to the romance part, but maybe that was what was so good about it. Maybe the same old formula was getting a little predictable.Liberty Jones is a teenager for most of the book. I think my problem was I was expecting the same old thing and I didn't get it. What I did get was a great story with a little romance at the end. This book is exactly as it says on the cover: ""A Novel"", not a romance novel.I enjoyed this book a lot, but I hope Kleypas will not give up her historicals entirely. I just love all those corsets flying off and all that."
2,Story WAY out of proportion---,"The first 75 percent of this story reads like a teenage girl's diary of her struggles and disappointments and is suitable for a middle school audience. The next 20 percent is the same thing, but during her twenties. The last five percent deals with her love life and plays more like a soap opera. I wouldn't label this a romance but more of a human interest story focusing heavily on one young character. Narrator did have a little-girl's voice but it fit the adolescent theme. Glad when it was over."
3,A Little Too Saccharine,"I'm typically a fan of Kleypas' work, but this book fell short for me. The pacing is uneven throughout the novel. An inordinate amount of the novel is devoted to Liberty's childhood and the final chapters of the book are rushed. The characterizations also seem a bit unreal.Kleypas also does sizable amounts of information dumping. Whole paragraphs are devoted to: ""Texan Men"" or ""Houston Suburbs."" It's clear that she loves her homestate, but it's trite and unnecessary.It's still a good bit of escapism, but you might want to visit your library or wait for the paperback edition."
5,COULD NOT PUT THIS ONE DOWN!!,"This book was not what I would call a ""romantic"" in your face novel. The writing and story are so good I was not even disappointed that there was very little romance until the last half of the book. This is the story of a young woman named Liberty who puts her life on hold to help her mother raise her little sister Carrington and what happens in her life as she grows in to a woman. I have never read a romance like this and am going to read ""Blue Eyed Devil"" her next book in this series, and I bet it is as good if not better than ""Sugar Daddy"". Lisa Kleypas is one of my new favorite authors, I am so glad I discovered her! What a talent! Keep up the excellent writing!"
4,Wonderful mix of gritty reality and fantasy,"This is the first book in the Travises trio, but I read it last. And I liked it best. The first half of this book is more of a Bildungsroman than a romance, and it took a long time for Liberty to actually meet Gage Travis, but I really enjoyed reading about Liberty's life and who she was and how she became the woman who did eventually meet and fall in love with Gage.Once we get to the romance part, there's a liberal serving of Rich Businessman to counteract the Shy Virgin (Not A Virgin But Not Good In Bed version). There's a child (Much Younger Sister version) whose attachment to the romantic interest is an indication of his worthiness, and to induce ovulation. There are the fantasy elements that come with plenty of money - taking the Gulfstream to Paris, and the like. I love romances with rich, sexy, take-charge, sensitive heroes, so this isn't a complaint. Especially when they're this well written, and have such an interesting cast of characters."
2,Read like a V.C. Andrews novel,"..which is okay, if you like V.C. Andrews novels. I don't. I do love Lisa Kleypas, and cannot understand how a woman with the skill and imagination she has in spades could write a romance novel with so little in the way of romance. As other reviewers have noted, it was bothersome that a) the heroine was named Liberty b) she was a teenager for much of the book and c) is in love with someone else for most of the novel, too. It's not so much that LK weaves a story in which the heroine truly loved someone else first, it's that the ""real"" hero gets short shrift, practically tacked on to the end of the book. I was never emotionally engaged."
3,Too much story,"Ms. Kleypas is a great writer, but this story was too...just too many useless words. Hardy was great. But why wasn't he the main character? Why was he even there? It was a cruel thing to do to the reader. If I hadn't completed Smooth Talking Stranger before this one, I probably would have put this book down a second time. Three stars for the writing. Two and a half-stars for the amount of useless words."
4,Perfect Beach Book,"Slap some sunscreen on and go to the beach with this book. It's a perfect vacation read. You'll need the sunscreen because you probably won't want to put the book down. The characters are 3-dimensional, believable (that is, flawed like the rest of us), and warm; you'll like the main character especially. The plot (like most-all?-romances) is a bit Saturday-matinee, but isn't that why we read them?"
2,"Maybe, maybe not","Some historical novelists have been making attempts, with a lesser or greater degree of success, to go contemporary. I can understand why: there are many fewer constraints in trying to be historically correct, an author might need to refresh an imagination become bored. I like Lisa Kleypas' writing as a rule and she deals with a period that few other authors even attempt, with great verve and authenticity. So why a contemporary? I don't know, since this book did not convince me she should do it again. I just didn't like the story or the protagonists much. Sorry. I am convinced she can do better than this -- in any period."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading Lisa Keypas' contemporary story because I enjoyed her historical books. This one, however, fall short of the wonder characters and story lines as her historical work. I also did not like the writing in the first person narrative. This book is more of a young woman's self discovery into an adulthood rather than a romance story. I hope she will not stop writing the historical novels."
5,Sugar Daddy - So Good,"This is my first Lisa Kleypas book. I loved it! I laughed. I cried. I was glued to the pages. Her characters were so real. I felt like I was right there with them. Her writing is very descriptive and captivating.When I boughtSmooth Talking Strangerfor my kindle, I had no idea that it was book three in a trilogy. I found that out after the fact and since I do not like to read books (series) out of order I then had to buy and read Sugar Daddy and Blue-Eyed Devil (which I am almost finished with and loving). I highly recommend reading this trilogy in order since characters are carried over from one book to the next.The Travis men, what's not to love about them? Texans, alpha males, simply delicious. Strong females, women who can stand on their own. Survivors. Lisa Kleypas certainly knows how to develop her characters. Oh, and the lovin' ? Oh, so steamy!I may be living in Florida, but my heart belongs to Texas!"
1,So disappointed!,"First of all I didn't like that I never got the male view of the story, this would have helped while developing the character of Gage. Over half the book was dedicated to Liberty's feelings for Hardy and then all of a sudden she's in love with another man, a man she didn't even like from the start and knew for like 5 minutes! I was upset that Hardy was made to look like a selfish traitor in the end....he deserved a better ending than that. I would have preferred an ending with Liberty and Hardy, after all, I think they both deserved it after what they shared in their childhood/teen years. I was left feeling frustrated and expecting if not a Liberty-Hardy ending, at least a bit more romance build up between Liberty and Gage."
5,Great series,"This was the first book in a trilogy and it was a light read introducing the Travis family from Texas. I really injoyed this series. The love scenes in this book is light, completely different from the other 2 which have very passionate love scenes. Great beach or travel read."
3,a rather good story!,"If you think that the main characters of this book are Liberty and Gage, it's very difficult to understand why almost the 2/3 of Sugar Daddy is quite boring story about Liberty's childhood. You have to read almost whole book, before they even met and finally when something starts happening, the book ends. But the when they finally met, the good part starts and you will be sorry that it ends so soon! Good thing is their story continues in other books of Travis-series."
3,A little surprised by its brevity,"I didn't read the description too thoroughly before purchasing the book - I was a bit nonplussed to see that there are corporate annual reports that are thicker than this volume (it's only 76 pages). Essentially, it's a series of essays that outline the history of blackletter type and its significance in Protestantism and Catholicism vs. roman type. If you're a typophile it's a must-read in spite of its brevity - if you're a lover of history you might still enjoy it as the essays touch upon political forces throughout history (such as the Nazi's insistence to do away with all things blackletter and in so doing debasing the heritage of those who used it).Overpriced given its short length, but well-written and informative nonetheless."
3,I have used and really benefited from rinsing ...,"I have used and really benefited from rinsing with Listerine in the past, and I was hoping this one would be a little easier on taste. Listerine works great but tends to leave a burning sensation in my mouth. I found this Fresh Burst version was even hotter than what I've used before and I didn't care for the sensation. I would definitely recommend it for effectiveness, but if a very strong-tasting mouthwash bothers you, you won't be happy with this one."
2,Don't be fooled by the green color and ...,"Don't be fooled by the green color and the new flavor. When I received the bottle I was excited to test it until I put some in my mouth. The same old Listerine MEDICINE taste is there. It made my whole mouth numb. I had a friend try it too, and the same thing happened to him. I would never buy or recommend this product. The medicinal aftertaste lasted for several hours."
5,Rhinotek HP LaserJet,"Great quality, I don't notice any difference in print quality in comparison to the HP refills."
5,Very satisfied!,Product came to me in the condition promised and was shipped in a quick manner. I was extremely satisfied!
2,Dissapointed,"I love the debut album from the Fray and thought this guys will have a bright future. I'm disappointed cause this guys forgot the rule of gold for sophomore albums. If your first album did great you have high expectations among fans, take your time, but your second album MUST be even better than the first if you wanna be around for a long time.How are they suppose to be touring this year with a 7 song album which one of them (Vienna) was already featured on their first album???Damn so that gives us 6 songs 3 minutes long each one aprox. Of music...The songs are good but nothing out of the box to match their first album.Honestly this is not worth buying, just download the song you like the most or something."
5,Great Album,"I really like this album. This was before the ""How to Save a Life"" album, but the songs are just as addicting and easy to listen to. The lyrics are also well thought out."
3,Short but sweet,The debut EP for this Denver-based group is short but sweet and well-worth adding to my collection. The definitely set themselves apart from the fray!
2,What dosage,"Would be a great product if dosage was included in directions, we have no idea how much to give our 10lb cat."
5,great item,"the product was great, inexpensive and shipping was even faster! thank you my kitty feels so much better and it worked in just minutes. great product!"
5,perfect,The item arrived in perfect shape and right on time i am well satisfied.I would definatly order from this place again.
3,not bad,not a bad read at all but printing could be larger for those of us that have vision problems
2,Not white.....,The actual faceplate itself is fine besides the fact that it's not actually white. Ordered this and received an off-white (almost almond) faceplate....
3,Really limited information,"The format of this series of guides provides for really limited information, just a list of standard information about public campgrounds.We only looked at three campgrounds from this book, and in all cases the list of information about them had significant errors.For example, we stayed in space 25 of a campground listed as having 15 spaces; two campgrounds that we drove to were down dirt roads while the book stated that they were down paved roads; one of these was down a completely different road than the book said.These might seem like nitpicking complaints about insignificant details, but there is nothing in the book but insignificant details."
4,Excellent Guide for Both Visitors and Residents,"As a resident of Hailey, Idaho, I spend much of my summer hiking months and fall hunting seasons exploring the mountains and staying in campgrounds. I bought this guide because I wanted to get a better idea of what campgrounds offered for young families like mine so that I did not have to guess about the amenities or campground capacities. There are no bells and whistles here but it provides all the information you need to decide on which campground to try. This has almost all the BEST campgrounds in the state and only leaves off those that are either out of the way or fewer than 4 campsites. Even if you are planning on backpacking or camping in undesignated sites, this is a good encyclopedia to keep in your car if you are resident of the Gem State or a visitor passing through."
4,Camping Idaho,"I just moved to Idaho, so wanted to get an idea of places to camp. It's a good book, I got a lot of information from it."
3,The success that almost was.,"The Boeing 247 airliner was perhaps most important not for its advanced design and technology, but for what it inspired. The Douglas DC-1 and later DC-3 were designed for airlines that couldn't get the 247. They were larger, faster more comfortable and reduced the 247 to a footnote in aviation history.Still, it was quite a footnote. The twin-engine, all-metal airliner with retractable gear and a host of (for the day) advanced features pointed the way to the future of commercial aviation, setting a number of records in its own right.An in-depth look at a relatively little known airplane."
2,Not about bolting parts on,i was dissappointed because this book tells you about the parts that the world sells and nothing about installing it.it's a good book to see what in the market though.
2,not informative,"This book is good if you are looking for a list of available products for your car, but it is mostly advertising products for companies. It does not tell you about the product or how it works. It does not give you even the slightest idea about installing the product on your car. Again, it's a good book but only if you want a big list of parts for you car."
1,Partially hydrogenated oil,"Does no one care that these are made with partially hydrogenated oil? Not something I'd want to consume, let alone give to my kids."
3,Not for kids.,"These are yummy and physically appealing to little kids, but sadly they are really bad for them. Ingredient #2 is partially hydrogenated oil. I would love it if they would change it to something less deadly- as my kids love them.As it stands, I consider it the health equivalent of a pack of cigarettes in their lunchboxes. :-("
5,one legged willy's favorite big sandy cd,"one legged willy loves this western swing rockabilyl cd/ ive only got oen leg, but i know good rockabilyl swing music when i hear it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,Fun! Challenging! Sexy!,"Ok, maybe it wasn't sexy, but seriously, this is an awesome book. It is challenging, but without being too hard. It has many creative puzzles, some that I have never even seen before. There are also some well-known puzzle types, which I thought was a good thing. Think you are good at those newspaper crossword puzzles? You haven't seen anything yet! These puzzles are very fun, and it is a great deal better than sitting around and watching television. It is also a good way to pass the time. I honestly think this is a great book, and, in no way, a waste of money. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."
4,"Heartbreak Hill, a book for fans of all ages","I have just recently finished the book Heartbreak Hill and I found it to be entertaining but also interesting at the same time. I must disagree with the Kirkus Review. This book clearly states all the information that you need in a clear form. There is not confusion. I find the analogies in this book good due to the fact that it adds some unexpected humor to this book. Although I am a golfer, I did not clearly understand the Rider Cup until I read this book. It explained a brief history of the golfers and how they fared that year. It also explains how this is the single most important golf tournament of the year and also gives a brief history on that. Whether you are a huge golfing fan or a person who just wants to read an entertaining book, I recommend that you read Heartbreak Hill."
3,texture issue,"these mashed potatoes are a bit remiss in the texture department but overall taste is good, and preparation couldn't be quicker or easier!"
5,Oh Logic...,"I ordered this book for a college Logic class, and it hasn't disappointed. There's no getting around the somewhat boring text in this book, even though it is flavored by some humorous logic scenarios. But, I fault my lack of interest in the subject, and not the book itself. I've learned a lot from the class, and the book is essential.It arrived in great condition, even though I ordered it used, and it had a speedy delivery."
1,Caution::Understanding Symbolic Logic (4th Edition),"This book is beyond AWFUL. First of all, it is filled withthe most annoying errors.The manner in which material is presented is very scatter.Klenk introduces a basic concept, by analogy, with an advanced concept; however, the advanced topic is covered in future chapters.This book is no more than Symbolic Math(e.g., actually Discrete Mathematics). Klenk has a Degree in Mathematical Philosophy and if you don't then good luck and many sleepless nights are required.I highly do not recommend this book!!!"
5,Excellent textbook,"I really like this book. It's an excellent undergraduate introduction to logic for non-mathematicians. It's not dumbed down in any way. It's rigorous. The exercises are challenging and plentiful. Most importantly, it explains the basic concepts and tools of symbolic logic in a clear, unpretentious manner. (The 5th edition corrects the mistakes of the 4th.)By comparison,Copiseems unfocused and flabby;Bergmann & Moorcomes off as unnecessarily muscular given the level of the material.An excellent choice."
5,"Be lifted up, and drawn into truely beautiful music",I have recently discovered Secret Garden and have been totaly blown away. There style is not to disimilar to Clannad but with much more depth and feeling. I would recommend anyone to buy this album and experience somthing truely wonderful!
1,FBI Price to HIGH,"The price is way to high,you would think this series came out in 2011. A full season should be $30:00-35:00 dollars. They treat this like perry mason. I have bought 400 seasons from amazon of shows. good way to lose me. All most $100.00 per season they must be on crack."
1,AGAIN...FIFTY DOLLARS LIST PRICE FOR HALF A SEASON IS OUTRAGEOUS,"OUTRAGEOUS PRICE, AGAIN!! Two reason's why I wont purchase this.....first, the price. Second, they probably wont release the rest of the seasons. I'm tired of studios not releasing all seasons to a series. And at this price they wont sell enough to justify the second season being released on DVD. Warner should sign the rights over to ""Shout Factory!"". They can do it at a much fairer price."
3,Great TV series - been waiting to see it again for years,"The FBI was a wonderful TV series. As a kid, I watched it every week. Quality scripting, quality acting, everything that you would expect with the Quinn Martin moniker. I have probably keyed in ""FBI TV series"" on the Amazon search page about 100 times over the years. I was surprised to see it finally made available, a split Season One. The introductory price is too much to pay (hey, unemployment is at an all time high, disposable incomes at an all time low). I will wait until Season One is offered at a reasonable price, for each half of the season - offered together. Why not save us all the trouble, offer the entire series as a boxed set, in the $100 price range. What an entertainment bonanza that would be! I have seen the price drop slightly for Season One, Part Two. I will wait until a boxed set comes out, with the entire series. If not, I guess I'll have to give up this bit of TV nostalgia."
1,The FBI: Season 1,As a kid I loved this show. Now on DVD in 2 parts - what Greed.I have Ironside 1-7 and Mannix 1-5. It's in full box set. Whyon earth can they do that and for peats sake lower the price!!.
5,The Perfect Gift for Your Favorite New Englander,"I am a New England-born history and trivia buff. I thought I knew everything there is to know about my favorite region, but I never realized just how much I have been missing! This book is chock full of fascinating, well-chosen facts, written in an evocative style that is at times touching, often funny, but always interesting and easy to read. The attractions and destinations the author describes run the gamut from educational to more than a little wacky. The book's organization -- by region and town -- makes it a great reference guide to use as a day-trip planner, or to keep in the glove compartment for quick reference when you find yourself out and about with some time on your hands on a crisp fall day. This is the perfect gift to leave on the bedside table in your guest room, and to give to your favorite New Englander -- I wish someone had given it to me years ago!"
2,Low Grade,"The quality of the video was low grade. Although I thoroughly enjoy Bocelli's voice - the audio of this video was abysmal and did not do him justice. The concert was recorded live and outdoors and was, I hope, the reason the audio was so weak. It would be a shame if the Bocelli voice/sound is only wonderful in the confines of a recording studio.The personal information about Andrea was informative but overdone. I guess I wanted more music and less talk. My opinion - I didn't think the video was worth the purchase price."
5,A man who truly sings from his heart.,"I heard and saw Andrea Bocelli sing from ""A Night In Tuscany"" on PBS. He so touches my heart with his singing that I knew I had to find some of his CD's. I did just that and love the video and the 2 CD's I have. One is the arias and one is the Romanza. My son is now an admirer of Andrea's just as his mom is. By all means get the video and enjoy it on your terms in your house. You will love them. He is a great singer who will touch your heart!! You will never be the same."
4,This video was a teaser to see the man perform live.,"I had the good fortune to see Andrea Bocelli sing at the Hollywood Bowl at an extremely close vantage point. The air was heavy with electricity as celebrities and non-celebrities reveled in the sheer magic of Bocelli's performance. For me, the special moment was when Bocelli sang ""The Prayer"" to Elizabeth Taylor standing onstage with him. To naysayers of his talent as not pure operatic gymnastics, I say, ""You're missing the picture."" There might be more technically polished tenors in the world of opera, but none that can deliver the goods with such grace & poise. He is heaven sent. And for those who admire what he has accomplished, he is the voice of the archangels."
5,It stirred me to my soul,"Not being an opera fan in particular,the ""Time to Say Goodbye"" duet with Sarah Brightman was the first exposure I had to Andrea Bocelli last year.It immediately captured me,as it has millions of others,and I went out and bought ""Romanza"" I was skimming the television channels one night when I came upon Vermont Public Television and ""A Night in Tuscany"".I was mesmerized,transfixed.I couldn't move.I bought the video as gifts as well as for myself.I can't think of money better spent. The highlight for me was ""E Chiove"",the 12th piece.ACHINGLY BEAUTIFUL."
5,ANDERA IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE THAT TAKES YOU TO HEAVEN,ANDREA BOCELLI TAKES TO TUSCANY WITH OUT LEAVEING YOUR HOME.ANDERA SINGING IS LIKE A VOICE AN ANGEL. HE CAN TAKE YOU HEART AND SOUL WITH HIS PERFORMANCE. YOU CAN WATCH HIM PERFORM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS IF THIS WAS THE FRIST TIME YOU HAVE SEEN IT. SO SIT BACK AND LET ANDERA TAKE YOU TO TUSCANY AND FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS HEAVENLY PERFORMANCE. IF WAS ABLE I WOULD GIVE HIM 10 STARS. ENJOY
4,Beautiful and touching performance with Bocelli's friends!,The Fourth Tenor is moving in his words and music as well as the obvious commradery with his vocal counterparts (John Miles and Sarah Brightman). Wonderful story of his life and family intertwined with the inspirational Italian pop-opera of Andrea Bocelli!
3,Unfortunate,"Mr. Bocelli was fine and I especially enjoyed his rendition of Nessum Dorma. I thought the interspaced vinettes are not particularly interesting and detracted somewhat from his performances. Ms. Brightman also seemed to have some slight pitch issues, but these I thought are very minor.The reason why I rated this three stars isn't so much for the performances, which generally are very good. The problem is this dvd only uses Dolby 2.0 and it really does not do any justice to the Mr. Bocelli and his friend's vocal abilities nor the performances of the orchestra... it all sounds a bit flat.I would recommend renting this first."
4,"Great DVD, Appears to be Region 1 not 2","One star off because the region was not as indicated. It plays in my US player, but I wanted to send to a relative in Japan, which is region 2. I don't believe it will work on their player."
5,A beautiful performance!,"I have always been deeply moved by music to the very core of my being, at times bringing tears and actual pain in hearing particularly moving pieces performed. Andrea Bocelli's singing comes from within his soul and inner self, as demonstrated by his incredible expressiveness of what he is singing. He also has a huge lung/breath capacity, and to me unimagineable capabilities in controlling it. I am definitely not an opera officianado, but thoroughly enjoy this concert of familiar exerpts including some in duet with Nuccia Focile. The sections of the tape which are of him speaking of his home and family are especially endearing and much appreciated. Too often we put artists/operatic singers on a pedestal and fail to remember that they, like us, are warm human beings who treasure their homes and family."
5,#1 in Tuscany!,Listening to Bocelli in Tuscany helps me believe I am in love in the Thirteenth Century Italy!
5,"Sorry, ""expert"" singers...Viva Andrea !","I have loudly laughed myself reading the negative comments of some ""professional singers and experts"" who have added negative reviews about Andrea Bocelli, especially ""Figaro"" and his followers. All I can say is that when some people get to know (or seem to know) too much about something they lose the ability to enjoy good things. This guy Figaro recommends the Three Tenors...Well, I have listened to them...Carreras, Placido Domingo, I have listened to Pavarotti's songs, too...But, sorry, I had never felt anything special for that stuf... On the other hand, I have felt all kinds of wonderful emotions listening to Andrea's songs. If that happens because I am an ignorant about technical aspects of singing, I don't care. Thank God it happens like that! I had not been so enthusiastic about any other singer in my life as I am for Andrea Bocelli. Viva Andrea!"
5,Heaven,"If you have the chance to hear Andrea Bocelli sing in any form, TAKE IT!!! This man has a gift. I saw this program on PBS and was enthralled. The performances are heavenly and the landscape is beautiful."
5,Bocellimania hits the US.,The next phase of pop music for the baby boomers has hit the US.Bocellimania has ascended to the pop throne taking its place next to Elvis and the Beatles.Never has so many been attracted to such powerful and clear vocals and not understand the language .He has the unique ability to take an obscure tune and turn it into an enduring classic.His legacy is only beginning and I am sure it will be a long one.
5,A Night in Tuscany---Andrea Bocelli,"I think that this video is really good, it made me want to go to Italy. It also gave a great insight into this man with the most beautiful voice in the world. The scenery is beautiful, but the voice is the best. Thank you, Mr. Bocelli for giving me so much beauty."
3,"Exquisite performance, disappointing audio quality.","Mr. Bocelli is enrapturing and provides an exquisite performance. However, this is a very disappointing use of the DVD/AC-3 technology. While visually exemplary, the audio quality is clean yet barely above mono. The incredible locale could have provided a much greater sense of spending the ""Night in Tuscany"" had the transfer been accomplished correctly."
5,The most wonderful video I've ever seen and listened to!!,"Bocelli made us so proud to be of Italian descent!! What a blessing he is...he brought tears of joy to all of us on Christmas day with this wonderful video. This video is one you have to see over and over...it's addictive and beautiful!! What a God-given talent he has... We especially enjoyed the scenes of him and his family at the villa with his music in the background...He is an inspiration to all of us. His ""Romanza"" CD is just wonderful also, and we enjoyed so many of those songs on this video."
5,Superb,"We not only played this on our computer but we also showed this on our DVD player and the quality it superb, wonderful, not to mention how great Andrea Bocelli is. His duet with Sarah Brightman is very moving. I could not have asked for a better representation of Andrea Bocelli's music."
5,Perfect product,I buy this regularly and in bulk. It is the only lip product that truly protects me from chap lips as well as eliminates cold sores developing. It can appear a little greasy but its what I need. Some might consider messy because you must apply with your finger. it also can be addictive.
4,good overall,"I made the purchase only a few weeks ago. It was a 2011 product. (I wish amazon could somehow provide such information at the product description)The balm feels fine and has a gentle and nice smell. My only complaint has to do with the container. I wish it came in a tube or something similar, but not in a jar. But this is something I knew before I placed the order. I just felt it is more inconvenient than I expected.But if you are okay with the jar, I would recommend this product."
2,Terrible,"I really like lip balm pots, so I decided to give this one a try. The smell was so terrible that I ended throwing this lip balm away. Everytime I applied it to my lips, the horrible scent penetrated my nostrils, lol. I will never buy this particular product again. They have one that comes in a blue pot and I might give that one a try. I don't see how anyone could have gave this a positive review. It might be a good lip balm but the smell was nauseating."
5,I agree,"I use the blistex lip medex and I hate it when you reach the end of the jar and you have to use your nail. It makes my nails gooey inside so everything I touch sticks to them, but I still love it and use it everyday :)A*"
5,Recommend,"Yay!! I live by this stuff!! Was so happy they arrived super fast and without an problems. I was nervous ordering this product online from a source I didn't know, but the vendor was great!"
5,Blistex DCT,"I like this product. Keeps my lips from getting chapped. I'm really glad Amazon had this, can't find it at any stores near me."
5,Amazing Lip Balm,"My husband and I had recently been unable to find this product in our stores, and freaked out. We have both been using this product for years (he and I are musicians--and it doesn't break down your lip tissues like Carmex does). Also it is the perfect base for lipstick, and gives you a pretty shine without gloss stickiness. Heals lips super quickly. Cant live without it, so I was more than pleased to buy in bulk!"
2,Don't get too excited...,"I'm a HUGE David Foster Fan, and of course I had to buy this one as well, BUT... !!! This is NOT the David Foster you think it is. He might look the same on the cover, but the music is completly different. I know my Foster well!This is an artist who happens to have the same name. Though HE should change it, I guess he makes some sort of profit of it.Now that we have cleared the air... The album is not that bad. It's filled with nice songs accompanied by guitars. So if you're into this kind of music, you might wanna check it out, but there are so many other albums I would reckomend before this one. But HEY... if you wanna be the SECOND guy in the world to buy this, you just go ahead."
3,"A decent buy for the cheap price, but not moisturizing enough for chronically chapped lips","Just like listening to the Spice Girls, good old Carmex brings me back to my childhood. A classic standby, Carmex offers a refreshing menthol feeling and glossy finish - not to mention a price tag that's hard to beat. The consistency of the yellow gel is rather delightful - slippery enough to glide easily on the lips, but sticky enough to adhere for decent lasting power. I enjoy the signature scent, but keep in mind that it may not appeal to everyone. On the downside, Carmex doesn't provide enough moisture for my very dry lips. While the balm feels soothing when initially applied, it returns my lips back to their desert-like state as it wears off.Read more reviews at [...]"
1,crappy,warning: Spend a few more dollars and get a higher quality frother. It's too cheap and not worth the hassle to send back. Switch has malfunctioned and won't stay on.
3,wimpy frother,"On the battery operated frother scale, this one is cheap and that is really all you get. Not a very powerful one even with new batteries, so don't expect a nicely frothed cappuccino and heaven forbid you try to have a frothed hot chocolate with it. If you use a frother more than a couple of times a year, I'd really recommend going with a more expensive model."
2,"It does""t fly.",If you are Looking for an authentic type aviator hat with attached goggles which could stimulate a child's interest in airplanes this product is not it.
1,Waste of my money,Turns out that Apple does not support any Windows/Microsoft products like it states on the box. I can't run this on my iMac like I had planned.
5,BF Mac,"By far, one of the most entertaining and graphic-oriented game I have ever experienced. This is a very sharp game with an excellent story, amazing graphics and audio but most importantly a very addictive game. A must have for any FPS fan! I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
1,why would you sell a game that doesn't run in osx lion,when i received this game i put it in my mac and it said i can't play it because i have lion instead of snow leopard.
5,Great Game,"This game is one of my all time favorite games! Although the game's campain is just facing the computer on a map. The game makes up for it by the killer 64 player online and the 35 vehicles you can operate. The online play is simply awsome, you can spend hours and hours on it. Another good feature are all of the mods for the game. The best one is called desert combat and is a must have! With operating this game i found no problums. No glitches, or any kind of problums running it. Although on 64 player matches expect some lag. Over all if you love 1st person world war II shooters, and great online play. Then this game is a must have!"
1,DVD isn't recognized on either of my MACs.,If I insert it on the I-MAC it says I inserted a blank DVD. If I try to do anything it locks up the MAC. On my MAClaptop after a minute or so it ejects the DVD. Returning the disk to ASPYR. So is the game any good? Don't know can't even load the thing.
2,Classic but dull,"This Mac game is a ""classic"" but it is dull by today's standards. It is difficult to enjoy this type of game having played such awesome modern games. I could only recommend it for the beginner to gaming, such as my 78 year old dad. Still, beginners start with much better games these days. It is MUCH better on PlayStation."
3,Punkbuster problems kill online play,All worked fine till I started getting kicked out of games because of punkbuster issues that are apparently too common and hard to resolve. Ruined the fun.
1,"Poor graphics, poor game play, poor product","I have a MacBook Pro 2.66 Ghz, 4GB memory and the 9400 and 9400GT video cards. The problems with the game are it's very poor graphics, very poor gameplay and significantly limited scenarios. Your options in game play are constrained by the limited programming as are your ability to interact with other characters in the game. Save yourself the money and buy Call of Duty 2. It is vastly superior, but will require strict compliance with the recommended system requirements."
2,Not What I Thought I Was Getting. . . .,"I ordered this after playing, and beating, all of the difficulty levels of Medal of Honor and Call of Duty. From what I've read, this was supposed to be the motherload of WWII simulations.I installed it and played it today. It wasn't what I was expecting. I like the first person shooters, like COD. This was more of a, well, battlefield. (I know. Duh.) Anyway, if you are into playing online with a whole bunch of people and not really having story lines, per se, to follow, this may be for you. If you like shooters like COD and MOH--with a definite ""path"" to follow, you might want to rethink this.The game's effects are spectacular, but I just don't have the grey matter to figure it all out. I'm unistalling and going back to MOH. Battlefield does a whole bunch of things, including overwhelming me."
1,Nothing more than a compilation of papers !,"Even if some of the papers whithin the book are certainly important contributions to their field, my impression is that it does not justify paying that price for extended versions of the papers. The book by itself is merely a compilation of the papers but NOTHING MORE ! If you are interested, just get the papers on the web and read them, but don't buy this book !I hoped i would find some unifying ideas in the book, or even remarks in the extended versions of the papers but nothing... I really wonder how it got published. The only useful information is the extended references for every paper (hence i gave 1 star) ...but it's not worth the price of the book !I have been extremely disappointed because i'm used to very good work from M. Taqqu, including numerous outstanding papers, but this book is the worst i've ever bought. It does not deserves the name ""book""."
5,Great!,This was my first Nacy Drew book (don't ask me why I started at number 128) My mother suggested it to me because I love mysterys. When Nacy and her two cousins so to a skiing resort they think that it will be a great way to relax. But soon they find out that someone is there for more then just skiing. They are looking for something much more valuable and they are willing to kill to get what they want........
3,"""This is a Great Record""",this record is awesome. It has got a lot of really great songs with real meaning This is probly the best from destinys child yet
5,"Not too ""gingery""",Loved all the flavors. I'm not normally a ginger ale fan but this one is very drinkable and not too heavy on the ginger.
3,The coke flavor tastes better,"Ginger Ale wasn't bad, left somewhat of a bad after taste. The coke flavor is the best from Celsius"
4,"Good for the money, could be a little more sturdy","I bought this to support a small camcorder that had no method of mounting to a camera stand or tripod. This works just great, but that clamp that holds the camcorder is at its extreme width. This camcorder is the size of a cell phone, the clamp itself is made of plastic. A little bit of rubber coated metal would have went a long way to making this a durable product. I would and have recommended it, but expect to buy a replacement in 3 or 4 years."
2,Nearly Worthless.,"For those who already own chillout collections from Ministry of Sound, Hed Kandi, and Naked Music, there is absolutely no reason to get this disc. Sony Music jumps on a bandwagon that's already getting stale with this collection of downtempo grooves. For the most part, the songs in themselves are pretty good, but we get predictable artists like Moby, Massive Attack, and Deep Forest who have already appeared on countless other discs. If a label is going to release an album of this nature, then it should dig deep and include rare quality tunes that may be underexposed. To its credit, it DOES have Jill Scott and Maxwell, giving this disc a welcome, soulful slant. But a couple of other tunes are questionable. What's music from the film ""Titanic"" doing here, for example? I can't say that this compilation is a bust, but it does almost nothing to separate itself from the rest of the other chillout CDs that are rapidly filling up record store bins. It's chillout with a corporate twist."
2,not adhering well,had a small plastic gas tank leak that was too large for melting fix; thought seal-all was perfect; it's not
1,Didn't work for my problem,"Had to replace a gas line on a string trimmer that passed through the gas tank. The replacement hose was just a bit smaller than the original, allowing gas to seep out when the tank was filled.I purchased this product after reading the reviews. I cleaned off the hose and the area of the tank where it passed through with a good degreaser, let it dry for about 1/2 hour, then applied the sealant. Waited over 24 hours before putting gas in the tank. As soon as I filled the tank, gas began seeping from between the hose and the sealant instead of between the hose and the tank.Seems like it will be a good adhesive for other uses, just not the one I bought to use it on."
5,This stuff works,"I have been using seal all for around 8 years now. I first discovered it when I was working on my old motorcycle. I couldn't get a rubber part to block the main jets in the carburetors so I went down to the hardware store and found some little plastic plugs. They wouldn't stay put, so I went back and found seal all. I secured the plugs using the seal all and they stayed put even though they were immersed in gasoline. There really aren't a whole lot of products that will hold up to gas exposure, but seal all does. It is my lifesaver whenever dealing with leaky gas fittings. It has the viscosity of model glue, so it isn't real thick, but it will bond things together and cover small holes."
1,Too Crazy and Too Weird,I must be crazy but how can anyone romanticize rape? William raped a defensive cripple girl repeatedly and she falls madly in love with him. Maybe there is a rape fattish out there but I just could not enjoy or understand this book. As a matter of fact I've started to see 2 trends in the Writers books so far that I've read. One is rape and the other is 2 men sharing a woman. Too Crazy and Too Weird!
5,REVENGE DISH SERVE COLD,"I wait five years to get this book. I am very happy I got this book. The plot was intense. The characters was intriguing and some of them...what is word I am looking for...""psycho!"" This book have three seriel killers, child abuser, heroic hero, determine heroine and couple good sex scenes. The story was entertaining plus it have few ""ohmygawd' moments! If you a book to keep you on your toes and entertain you this is it!!!!"
1,True Love?,"Cheating wife, murdered children and rape do not make a good romance. Gave it 1-Star only because I could not give it a 0-Star."
4,Loved this book,I loved this book. It kept me suspended as to what William was going to do next. Love how it all played out in the end.To all my hood book lovers try this one. If like me you have gotten tired of all that stuff.
4,Kept Me up All Night..,"This book kept me up all night. REAL TALK. At some points I was caught up in the suspense of the killer then at other times I was caught up in Abagail and William. Then, to make matters worse her father was just a complete Well I guess he was just a guy that loved his daughter. This story had a lot of twists and kept you guessing. It also had me rooting. Rooting for William to get his revenge. Which he did at the end. This is definitely a PAGE TURNER and very very good read."
4,This game is very high quality,"this game must have taken a long time to make. the cinimatics are amazing. the thing that really persuaded me to buy the game is they have the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket doing the voice overs.this game returns to the old fashioned style of RTS while fitting in a bleep load of great features. one of the features is the ability to select a target from a menu instead of having to click on a target going 100 mph(which is very hard in this game). another cool feature is the ability to slect any of your units through a menu that has tabs for land, sea, air, spec ops, and builds. though this all might sound complicated it is actually very simple. if you want a ""real"" RTS than look no further."
2,Don't even bother!,"Whatever you do, leave this game alone. supposedly based off the U.S.'s military strategy sim, this game is awful. Units don't behave accurately (i.e. rifleman taking out tanks with their assault rifles), A.I. pathfinding is horrendous, and the game is filled with bugs, from simple sound loops to full blown system crashes. Real War's only saving grace is the cameos from Lee Ermie and the resource gathering system. Real War is nothing like real war, and is a waste of money."
2,The name should be Real Lame.,"I got frusturated with this game while playing it. Controlling your land most sea units is not difficult at all. It is similar as with any other RTS game.Controlling air units was a bit difficult. The air units move rather quickly, and for fast games, controlling all your units at once becomes a laborious task. A plane may be on an airfield, carrier, or in the air. Unless you are good at tracking all of your planes, it is difficult to keep up with all of them at once.The only good point in the game that I can think of would be the Briefings. The movies at the beginning of some of the misssions get you into the patriotic mood at times, and that is about it."
2,OK,"This game is OK. It could be better. First, the Units get stuckand they can't move. Then I have to destroy it and buy a new one. I also don't like how long it takes to load. The graphics are good though. There is not enough missions. Only 24, that sucks. It would be alot better if there were more levels. The last level for the US is the best. I hate how the computer always rebuilds the bridges. The vehicles are good. I would seriously recomend the COMAND & CONQUER series."
1,Totally Bogus,"This game is not realistic at all. It is the worst war game I have ever played and I consider it to be a total rip-off. It is extremely doubtful that the US military uses anything remotely like this for training as is claimed. There is very little strategy, you are extremely limited in what you can build, which means your opponent is following the same strat you are. For example, you can only build one large bomber (realistically called a ""carpet bomber"" in the game) so you can't experiment with differing air power strats, nor could I build more than one airfield. This game is little more than a poor copy of Warcraft or Starcraft but is not nearly as much fun, as challenging, or even as realistic (Real Bad considering those two are fantasy and science fiction)."
4,A near-real war game,"A good game, where you manage air , ground and naval units, many fights, but after you block the enemy's first attack, you can easily win.Its graphics are better than the game itself, but the game is amusing and nice."
1,Don't Believe the Hype!,"I only wish I had read the reviews for this game before I wasted $40 on it. This game is laughable. Sure, the cinematic clips are awesome...but if you want a war movie, go and rent a DVD. From a GAMING standpoint, this 'Real' War game is a joke.Good luck with the 4th Campaign mission called 'Allied Shield'. It is much too difficult of a mission, and hearing the Full Metal Jacket drill sargeant mock you after each failed attempt, you'll be left mocking yourself for purchasing this disgrace of a game.I will never buy a game by S&S; Interactive again.WORST RTS EVER"
2,Not what I was expecting from the hype.,"I heard about this game early on, from several preview articles. I was really excited to hear a real time war simulator for the public was being released by a company that had developed real time simulators for the military. What a dissapointment this is! Definitely an arcade experience. I'm giving it 2 stars based on the fact that its highly unrealistic... and that I was expecting REAL WAR. If you like RTS's just for a beer and pretzel fun time game... this is fine i guess... if you are anything of a serious war gamer... STAY AWAY!!! Stick with Operational Art of War or any number of fantasic war games produced out there instead!"
3,Only Average,This game was a lot more fun many years ago when it was state of the art. now the graphics look average and the gameplay is weak. it is very cheap however to buy
2,bad game,"nice interface ,handy zoomin ,and that's all,i couldn't tell wich are my planes from the enemies planes ,both are the same color .when you concure your enemy ,the game will turn out to be a hide and seek game ,it took me 20 minutes to find were are the hiding enemy soldiers are just to finish the game .simply don't buy it"
1,Good Ideas... poor implementation,"... Frankly, this program stinks. I wish I had read the gamespot review before wasting my money on it.Poor AI engine (troops can't self-navigate around anything)Poor Strategy (can't coordinate troops)Poor controls (guys... hot keys to get to HQ would be nice!!!)and the game play is sporadic (processor speeds up or gets hung on moving some troop around the field)Don't buy it. Period."
4,Good but not great,"First off all, I would like to commend SSI for attempting to create a game that is coincendtially related to today's events with bin Laden et al. But these are not terrorists like Al Queda. Substitute terrorists with Iraq or Russia and the game title will be more accurate. True they use use current military (late 80's to early 90's), but that is where the game drops off. As much time as they spent into the detail of the game (great graphics and no useless resource gathering), they forgot to place intelligence into the opponent. Numerous times, I can build a couple of jammers and launch a tomhawk missle attack into their base, airdrop some commando's and the mission is over in about 10 minutes (after I got the needed resources). The enemy attacks you in a lemmings fashion, absolutely no coordination. However, in light of today's world, I love dropping nukes on the terrorists as our boys are in the field mopping up the scum. Good game to get you in the patriotic mood."
2,PLM casts a short shadow,"The theme is the same, IT rules and is the source of management for a company. It is disappointing that even in this age and past experience someone believes that an IT solution is the only way. There is no data or research unless you believe that Ford and GM are examples of best business practices."
1,Slots II Shutting Down My PC,"Within a few days of loading this software, my pc started shutting down on its own. The problem became so severe that I couldn't even get it to boot up for about six hours and then it would only boot in Windows Safe Mode. Upon uninstalling Slots II, my PC is working again, but still shuts down 3-4 times a week. The games were great, and I would give them 5 stars, but the problems have been severe. Has anyone else had this problem?..."
5,What a great gaming software,"Wow we had played their previous version and had thought that was fun, but this sure topped their old version. New games, more video slots with those terrific bonus rounds. If you like casino gaming you'll love this software. It will bring hours of entertainment to you and your family. Their latest release(Slots From Bally Gaming) is also a five star hit. They all have realistic graphics and are easily installed on windows 2000 and windows 98."
4,Swindle is OK,"Maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of yellow or orange or whatever Swindle is, but I am not too crazy about this figure. Maybe it's because I already have Hound and like his looks far better. The only real difference between the two seems to be color and the eyes and symbols.On the other hand Swindle is very easy to trasform if you already have Hound you know the routine. His arms also seem more stable and did not come off in transformation like Hound's did.I'd buy Swindle at the cheapest price $(...) but I wouldn't spend more then that. There are far cooler Alternators to pick ahead of him."
3,Not bad.,The tunes were not as fast I thought they would be. It seems the music repeats itself and does not seem to make you want to move in your seat.My favorites:- Inside my Soul by Liquid People- Promises by Olav BasokiEnjoy the tunes.
3,I enjoyed my Test Drive tube of Blistex. ...,"I enjoyed my Test Drive tube of Blistex. I think what I appreciated most about it was that it didn't sting my lips too badly, as most lip treatments containing sunscreen do. Of course, my ideal product wouldn't sting my lips at all, but I suppose that's a future breakthrough! The tube can fit in my small pocketbook or pocket, making it very convenient to bring along with me anywhere I go. And, the tube will last me a long time, making it a better bargain."
2,I didn't like this lip balm. It left ...,"I didn't like this lip balm. It left my lips with a waxy feeling. Also, it seemed to only make my lips more chapped, instead of soothing and healing them. I doubt I'd ever buy this product."
1,Contains cancer causing compounds,"Do not use this product. Why?Made with Padimate O: The excited padimate O molecule reacts bimolecularly with DNA and produces indirect DNA damages, that are similar to those done by ionizing radiation. Therefore padimate o is presumably photocarcinogenic.Made with Oxybenzone: This organic compound has been shown to penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination, which makes this substance a likely photocarcinogen"
5,The Only Lip Balm That Ever Worked for Me,"I have very bad cracked, dry lips, especially in the winter. I also tend to peel the skin off my lips. I have had all kinds of lip balms, and none seemed to work for me whatsoever. (I really hate the waxy ChapStick)I bought this because I saw it at Wal-Mart and I thought, hey, medicated lip balm, and as soon as I put it on I felt it working. The entire day I used it a ton and by the next morning, I could already tell a huge improvement in my lips. It healed most of my lips and they felt wonderful. I have never been so impressed with a lip balm. It's not waxy and it heals wonderfully. The smell reminds me of Pepto Bismol, but it's not unpleasant. It doesn't take long to get used to and it's only noticeable when you put it on.Unfortunately, the way it works for me might not work the same for you. But it's definitely worth a try to find your perfect lip balm. And for me, this one is it."
4,Good story,"The book begins slowly, but within a couple of chapters, the characters become familiar and the story line begins to emerge. The myriad story lines come together at the end with an exciting climax."
2,"Definitely absurd, not so magnificent...","I have a well-calibrated surround sound system and was interested in this product as it seemed that it might be useful for showing off my gear.I can sort of use it for that...depending on the audience. If the audience has already experienced a decent 5.1 encoded DVD, this disc will bore them.The 5.1 mix seems ""sterile"" - as though the goal was to throw a particular sound exclusively to a channel. While it's true that putting 5 discrete sounds in 5 discrete channels will demonstrate a 5.1 system, half of the tracks on this disc seem to do nothing more than that. In that half, there's no depth...and frankly not much compelling content to listen to.The other half of the tracks do a decent job of showing off the audio system at-large, a scant few do justice at showing how powerful and immersive a quality 5.1 mix can be for the listener."
2,"All audio, no video","As Chesky has such a great reputation, I couldn't wait to get this video. Well it is a DVD, but it's not a video at all, just a music. It was a pretty big disappointment."
2,Dr. Chesky's Musical 5.1 Surround Show DVD,"I purchased this DVD to evaluate my new surround sound speaker system, inculding receiver and cables. I was disappointed first of all that this was called a DVD. I thought when you purchased a DVD you not only got sound but video to compliment the sound. If I had the option to review this DVD before buying, I would not have purchased it. I'm still interesed in finding a better DVD."
4,Hot! Hot! Hot!,I've read a lot of romance novels but I think this one was the hottest! I enjoyed this book a great deal. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it weren't for a sentence structure problem that seemed to run all through the book. It was hard for me to follow at some points for that reason. I guess I know now why they made us diagram sentences in school it's too bad the author was absent that year.
5,My God....,"In short your typical blackened death thrash only multiplied a hundred fold. The thing that stands out most aside from the brilliant riffing and solos, is Lindberg's voice. The man must gargle acid! he has the most venomous rasp that has ever graced the scene..."
4,Worth reading,A good read and reminder for all who are just starting to deal with this problem with little ones or for those of us with 9 year olds and up who still are dealing with sleep issues.
2,ferber or pantley books have more practical advice for infants,"this one is not a great read, i put it aside in favor of other offerings. the ferber book is very good because it explains sleep patterns and why you're not doing your kids any favors by indulging nighttime demands - but it was clearly not written by a man... it advises that letting kids cry so much they vomit is okay - yikes. the pantley book is a kinder gentler interpretation of the ferber method (although i'm sure she wouldn't like to be associated with him). the combination of ferber and pantley has worked well for devising a strategy to help our 6mo to sleep better."
2,Growing Giving Hearts,"I found this work to be very research based. If you are a full time fundraiser in the Christian community it has useful information. If you are on a church committee, I would turn to another resource for support and information."
1,you will never get to finish this game,"I can't recommend you buy this game. It is loads of fun when it works, but at some point along the campaigns it will crash one more time and you will not be able to get past it. This is after you have installed the patch. It is incredibly frustrating and not what you expect from mac games. Customer support from Freeverse is no help and there will be no work arounds."
3,Great game but a little glitchy,This is a very fun game. It almost never gets old. The only problem that I have come across is that the game has a proclivity to crash during gameplay. But luckily it auto-saves frequently so you don't lose that much of your gameplay. The only time this becomes a problem is if it freezes you lose all of your saved information for that mission or map so you have to completely redo it.************UPDATE******************The developers for Heroes of Might and Magic have released a patch that fixes all the bugs including the crashing and freezing.
2,Get set to ... Crash!,"I have been a fan of this game series since HoMM II. This installment is actually fun to play, for as long as it runs. It crashes. A lot. As in you will actually have to restart your Mac by holding down the power button at least once because the game will lock up and you won't even be able to exit to the desktop. Most of the time it just quits. Good thing it autosaves frequently, but I have had saved games crash as they are being loaded. At least a few of my saved sessions appear never destined to be finished because of this. There are no troubleshooting options build into the program. The so-called programmers ought to be ashamed. The mac platform deserves better performance. And for this we waited over a year."
1,No Registration Code,"My computer meets all the system requirements and I have installed the game but when I try open in it asks for a registration code. There is no registration code on the cover of the manual as suggested and I have never submitted an email for registration. I'm stuck, I hope I don't have to return the game."
3,meh,"the game is great. I love this series, but the mac version crashed like every couple hours of play time. super annoying. that was a couple years ago, maybe they've fixed the bugs by now, but it sucked before"
3,GAME DOESN'T SAVE,"I bought Heroes V because I have an iMac and can no longer play the previous ones on a Mac. The game runs fine until I try to save the game, it wont work. Any time I play I have to play the entire level at a time and I am not able to play campaign mode because of this. Does anyone know a way to fix this? Please Help!"
3,Yet another mixed bag,"Pro: 220 minutes to cover nineteen races. Nice to get the in-car for qualifying. Nice insight into the races, particularly the US GP and the Michelin-farce.Con: This DVD, without a doubt, has the worst image quality I've seen on any F1 annual DVD. Including the first one. A LOT of MPG compression and pixelation. It's even pixelated on the menus. Check out the first lap at Spa for a good representation. A cloud of MPG noise is in front of Montoya's car. The TV broadcasts looked better...and I'm stuck with DirectTV, which is saying something. I'm sure that there's lots I've missed- I've only watched about 20 minutes.For those in the know, I did a service-mode convergence adjustment on my TV two days ago. And my DVD player is a Denon DVD2900.It looks horrible. Maybe next time they'll spend 30 cents more and use a DVD9 instead of this single-layer DVD. You've been warned."
4,Good disc for F1 fans,"From the main menu, each race has one in-camera lap view, narrated by the driver onboard. These are not the pole laps like last year's disk, but an apparantly random selection. It was obvious that they wanted to have many different drivers contribute to this DVD, instead of just a few pole drivers. It is neat to see each driver talk to the camera, and in some cases it is hilarious what they say and do. Also, be sure and see the very end of the disk, it has some interesting items.Otherwise the disk has brief summaries of each race. I still think they could have put many more in-car sequences to make a really fantastic disk."
5,Great product!,I love this product and have used it for years - makes my hair feel clean and shiny. Evidently it's being discontinued which really disappoints me.
5,A good value,"This bag is roomy and seems well contructed. I think it is an excellent value, and it seems better designed and sturdier than similar hanging bags I have bought before."
5,Worth the Money,"This is a good sturdy, well made bag. I recommend it for garage or closet storage of your clothes."
3,Serves the Purpose,"This jumbo dress bag serves the purpose - however, nothing holds the hooks in place so I needed to use the ultimate accessory - duct tape. I took a small piece and taped each hook in place inside the bag. This holds the hooks ""up through"" the plastic and in place so when you're moving this item, you don't lose one or many hooks! Originally it was much like moving a shower curtain. Every time you take it down to clean, the hooks pop out to make a seemingly simple job a pain the arse. In addition, there is the evident smell of plastic for a time. I hung this out to air before using. Right now it's housing 3 long dresses and 2 coats. I purchased the cedar hangers for storage as well. It serves the purpose but must admit that I found another dress bag at a hardware store (such as ACE) for less money and the frame is much better than this one."
4,Dress bag,I'm sure it's my fault but I didn't realize the bag fits over the rod. That's complicated for my situation just now as it requires a lot of moving. I'm sure it will be fine down the line. These bags are really quite large & sturdy.
3,Garment Bag,"I expected the entire bag to be made of plastic so as to insure that no insects would crawl in, but I found out that the back of the bag is made of some kind of porous fabric.Somewhat expensive for what it is.I'm hard pressed to recommend this bag."
1,Didn't like it,"I gave it away. You have to shread the closet bar through the bag to hang it. Mine are bolted to the wall and I can't do that without a major job. I have several others but they hang from the bar, not around the bar."
4,Decent larger dress bag,"This jumbo dress bag does what it should do. Protects your dresses from dust. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the hanging assembly is not that great. It is actually two separate bars inside instead of one solid pole, so when I take out a dress or rearrange what is inside, the poles slip around and sometimes the hanger slips off the closet pole as a result, which can dump the contents onto the floor. Once your realize this will happen, you go slower and take care for this not to happen, but it requires two hands...one to steady the pole and the other to retrieve your dress. I think a single pole, like in smaller bags, would not create this problem. Overall a decent bag and a good big side to hold a lot of dresses."
5,great series,i just saw set one of this series and it was great.cant wait to see set 2 when it comes out. If you like mystery you will love this
2,Crosley Mission Stack-O-Matic Home Audio System - Paprika (CR72-PA),"It arrived defective so since it came from a third-part distributor, we are still trying to get it repaired before the warranty runs out. It was a Christmas present purchased 12/3/06 so it has taken quite a while to get responses from the parties involved. Crosley had no record of course and the distributor was slow in getting back to us (can't remember who it was). Bob Cunningham"
4,Very cute.,"My 2 year old son loves this chair. We bought it for a music festival and for the beach last April. The bag that it goes in ripped out at the seams almost immediately, but it doesn't matter to us. The chair seems to be constructed better than the bag was."
4,Kitty chair,"We love this (and the elephant) fold-up chair. It's so cute, and my little guys love sitting on it for a few seconds here and there. They also enjoy dismantling it (undoing little screws, taking the arms off of the arm poles, etc.), but that strikes me as kid-specific. The chair itself is sturdy, and would still be in perfect condition if our little mechanics hadn't taken such an interest in it."
3,well...,"I have this album and I don't think it is that great. But maybe it is because I usually don't like live-albums. Just give me studio-tracks by Sioux and Budgie. If you would want an album containing an impression of the live-tour, you'd better try the new one 'Sequins in the Sun'. A nice thing about this album is, that it gives you a couple of Siouxsie And the Banshees-songs live! Even killer-bside 'Tattoo'. But hearing Sioux sing live on a CD is nothing compared to experiencing the Creatures live. So only for collectors i guess, though some people might totally disagree with me :)"
3,"Overall, the taste of Listermint is much more ...","Overall, the taste of Listermint is much more pleasant than the Listerine products I generally use. The only thing I wasn't sure of is why it's called antiseptic. It doesn't say antiseptic anywhere on the bottle and it's alcohol free. I'd say that if you want fresh breath, Listermint works very well. If you want to kill germs and fight decay, you may want to stay with other Listerine products."
4,The Listermint Antiseptic Mouthwash had a pleasant minty ...,"The Listermint Antiseptic Mouthwash had a pleasant minty taste. It tasted less like medicine than regular Listerine. It also did a good job of getting rid of my """"morning breath,"""" and came in an easy-to-grip plastic bottle, which made pouring easy. Using just 1 ounce, this product would last a long time, and 1 ounce was ample to freshen my breath. I'd recommend it to family and friends."
3,This product has a strong minty taste. If ...,"This product has a strong minty taste. If you like mint, you'll probably enjoy this mouthwash. I found that it didn't particularly refresh my mouth like I wanted it to. This could be due to the fact that it's not a peroxide-based mouthwash."
2,Cute But Doesn't Stick,"I bought this border for my 4 year old son's room. I think the design is very cute and my son LOVES it! The reason for my 2 stars is because it does NOT stick to the wall. We had trouble from the beginning trying to get the border to stick. It would stay for a little bit but would slowly pull away, making the whole border fall down all the way around the room. After many hours of fustration I finally just used thumb tacks to keep it in place. I used blue thumb tacks so it doesn't look too bad but for $12.99 a role the dang thing should work perfect! 3 out of the 4 rolls I bought did not stick. I'm very disappointed! BUT, since my son and I really like the design and I hate having to return things, I am keeping the border. So if you like the border and don't mind thumb tacks, go ahead and buy it. But if you want a product that works like it says then I'd recommend not buying this border."
4,Very Good,There is no coverage of texturing characters (disappointing but maybe I didn't read the web page well enough) but lot's of useful photoshop techniques.
2,"good intro, but bad photoshop tutorials","The book started out good, but fell apart when it got to the Photoshop tutorials. The author leaves out steps and the results don't come out the same as the authors. There are some reviews on the second edition that indicate this hasn't changed."
4,Great for a beginner,"This book turned me from a hack into someone who could actually make textures in a reasonable amount of time. The book does a great job of how to apply all those photoshop tricks to quickly create amazing results. It also gives you a methodology on how to make your textures easily modifiable.The book mostly covers textures found in the environment. There is no organic character texture creation. There are also a couple technical flaws here and there with some of the steps. This isn't too horrid, you'll just get a slightly different looking texture here and there.Even if you can't draw a straight line to save your life, you'll learn tools and tricks to make some really nice results. The time saved is well worth the purchase price."
5,Fantastic book!,"If you are a budding texture artist, this book is a must get.All of the tutorials are done in Adobe Photoshop (CS I think) either way, there is a demo version on the accompanying CD.The book is split in to 9 chapters the first 4 of which give an introduction to game art, computer graphics technology, Photoshop itself and prepping textures, all of which are important and thankfully, have been covered really well without getting too in-depth.Chapters 5 to 8 all start off with a picture of either a concept painting or a finished scene and you will then be taken step by step through the texture creation process, creating all of the textures in that scene.The subjects covered are: Sci-Fi, Urban, Fantasy and outdoor.The final chapter covers game effects such as Muzzle flashes, decals for bullit impacts, weather etc.I have been making textures for a hobby for a number of years and this is by far, the best book of its kind available."
3,Good book for what it is,"The cover is slightly misleading, in that it implies you can go from a sketch to finished art, which the book isn't about. There is a disclaimer on page XIII about that. This book isn't a complete how to create 3D art, many things lighting, render / game engine, post effects, control the final image and this book doesn't cover any of those subjects.On the other hand he does 'demystify' the process of creating texures by showing how complex textures can be built up by combining photos, Epaint & procedurals. Even an advanced artist should be able to pick up some tips if they approch the book with an open mind"
1,"1st edition---good intro, but bad photoshop tutorials","I bought the first edition. The intro (discussion of textures) was OK, but the Photoshop tutorials weren't. There were steps that were omitted and the results didn't come out like the authors. It appears that these issues are present in this version as well.Don't waste your money on this book. Get this training DVD instead:[...]"
3,I love the way this kept my lips ...,"I love the way this kept my lips soft, but the smell is awful. I wouldn't use it for the smell factor but the results are good if you get past the smell."
3,This product works great on dry or chapped ...,"This product works great on dry or chapped lips. Put it on at nighttime and by morning, my lips were 100 percent better! The only downfall is the smell. It smells really bad and by putting it on my lips, I seemed to smell it constantly!"
5,Best lip balm ever,"I have bought so much different lip balm and most of it I haven't been able to stand on my lips. This is the best stuff ever and I haven't been able to find it anywhere for a long time. My lips were so dry they just hurt and I found a new pot of Blistex Lip Medex that got lost in an over-full supply area. I decided to type it into the search bar on Amazon and was I ever HAPPY when it popped up.Someone had only given it 2 stars and I had to read that review to check it out. The reviewer said it burned hers and her husband's lips. I sure find that hard to believe. It has a really cooling feel to it, but burn???This stuff is very light as far as texture. Some lip balms are so waxy and thick feeling on your lips. It has that cooling effect when you first put it on which really feels good. Within a few hours of putting it on I can be wiping dry, damaged skin off my lips to reveal soft, new skin."
5,The only one that works in the desert,"I've tried a number of lip balms and this is the only one that has worked for me since moving to Arizona seven years ago. I've consistently had problems with dry, cracked and peeling lips, but this Blistex product has cured that completely. It has a soothing tingle upon application, which makes you feel like it's working. The smell is a bit menthol-like, but not enough to irritate my husband who can't stand anything ""minty"". I don't mind it coming in a pot - just as long as it works and this truly does!"
3,Overall I liked the product. I liked the ...,Overall I liked the product. I liked the scent and the texture was creamy and went on sore lips quite well. It was soothing. I didn't like having to apply it with my fingers. I'd like the product 100 percent better if it were in a tube so it didn't get on my fingers.
4,The Blistex Lip Medex did help with my ...,"The Blistex Lip Medex did help with my chapped lips. I didn't like the taste or the smell. It would be nice if either, or both, of those could be a little more appealing. I also think I'd like it better if it was in a chap-stick form as opposed to the tube. But as for the product itself, it did the job!"
4,It was very easy to use. It seemed ...,It was very easy to use. It seemed to help my chapped lips when I put I'd tell friends how it worked and let them decide whether to buy it or not.
2,Both my husband and I tried the Blistex ...,"Both my husband and I tried the Blistex Lip Medex. A few seconds after we applied it, both of us had a burning sensation on our lips. We didn't like it, and we don't plan to use it again or recommend it to our family and friends unless we warn them first."
1,amature - dont watch this one,Very poor quality production. The most annoying part was the back ground sound track that often did not match the video. The narrator sounded like he was reading one of his old essays from high school.
1,Martin Luther: Roman Catholic Prophet,"This book by Gregory Sobolewski is virtually unreadable.It is a classic example of a work by a college professor attempting to impress his colleagues with how many references he can cram into a document. Perhaps he is attempting to fulfull a requirement to ""be published"" for purposes of either a doctorate degree or tenure within his institution.This book ""jumps from one thought to another"" without giving the reader any meaningful opportunity to discern or in any way understand the cohesion of thought.My recommendation -- Don't waste your money on this pathetic attempt.-- Michael Dolan"
1,Borrow from the Library...,"which is what I did since I'm in Central Europe and don't have an adequate English-language bookstore to troll. Had heard so much about the book and the author that I thought I'd give both a shot. I'm happy I didn't pay one cent for this absurd book about a deceased woman's former lovers. Who would buy this drivel?! The plot is unbelievable and the ending's ""twist"" read's like an intellectual Abbott and Costello ""Who's on 1st"" routine. But wait, I don't want to insult A&C."
2,That book got tossed out the plane by sister.,"My sister and I are French. She talks and writed better in the Enlish than me. But we neither of us do understand that book is calling itself all the time Amsterdam. Some peoples is calling is great book. Some people is calling it very bad. My sister she very much likes to read to us when I am flying the plane from place to place. Winter, why you throw that book over Monaco when we was passing over that fun country? Nobody going to be reading that book down there. They got better things to do!"
3,Too Clever For Words,"Not sure how or why this won the Booker Prize. With one exception, the characters are a mean-spirited lot, and the novel just oozes cynicism. A couple of very funny bits provide some relief. But if you want this author's best, read Atonement. If you want a more satisfying story of betrayal and back-stabbing, read The Pardoner's Tale by Chaucer."
2,Unremarkable,"Uninspiring characters, short-story plot in full-length form, and lack of depth. Completely unremarkable book that has me wondering what the Booker prize people look for these days."
2,Booker Schmooker,"The best I can say about this book is that it tries to be one of those lightweight satiric novels that established authors sometimes toss off when they need to get something into print. It reads like it took a long weekend to write, and it takes about two hours to read. I suppose getting the two disagreeable central characters bumped off in an abrupt and unlikely manner is some sort of happy ending. None of the characters are likeable (rabid right-winger; hedonistic dead lover; conniving tabloid sleaze editor; self-absorbed, vain composer) and are too thinly sketched to be particularly interesting. Finally, anyone thinking the book might actually have something to do with the city of Amsterdam will be in for a let down. Enduring Love and Atonement were pretty interesting books; this one is merely annoying."
3,Greater Expectations,"Perhaps it's unfair to expect more from a Booker prize winner but having read ""Amsterdam"", I'm determined to check out the other finalists if only to decide whether this book is deserving. This is not to deprive Ian McEwan of the accolades bestowed upon him. Indeed, ""Amsterdam"" is a superbly crafted piece of work, smart and stylishly funny. It's laden with irony and it cleverly explores the dark side of friendship. However, except for the brilliant and sadly comic ending, the characters are quite forgettable. In my book, the mark of exceptional literature is its ability to move me. ""Amsterdam"" is very good but certainly not exceptional. I am however motivated to discover more of Ian McEwan's works and I hope to be better rewarded."
1,"Booker, Shmooker","The only reason I bought this book was because it won the Booker. I won't make that mistake again. A silly, conceited book about silly, conceited people."
2,"Unlikeable characters, unlikeable short story.","This would be better classified as a short story/novella. I read it in a little over an hour. Granted the story is technically well-crafted and well-written, it's not a good book. It reminded me of an essay you had to read about a ""morality story"" example in an old literature book. The two central characters were pretentious, self-absorbed, and unrelateable. You don't feel bad for them at the end. The pages kept turning, but perhaps it was because I was dying to know what was going to happen... surely a Booker Prize winning book had to have some kind of satisfying ending? It had a satisfying ending plot-wise, but I walked away with very little. As another reviewer said, this should have been in a literary anthology or lit magazine, it doesn't hold up as it's own."
2,much ado about nothing,"well,i will advise potential readers to not get swayed by the impressive honour bestowed on this book.it is a very average read."
2,unreal; less than 'Enduring Love',"The book starts fine, the ending is abrupt and is not based on any reality, whatsoever. The policy in the Netherlands concerning euthanasia is not understood and ridiculed beyond recognition. His previous book has more depth and is less sketchy."
3,Not deserving of the Booker.,"I have to say that I am dissapointed in the winner of the Booker Prize this year. This is a good book. Don't get me wrong. I am just not sure that it is anywhere near Booker caliber. In comparison yo some of the excellent past writers who have won--Rushdie, Peter Carey, Graham Swift, Ishiguru, Roy to name a few, McEwan's work just does not deserve the honor that goes along with the Booker. Considering that his competition included two authors deserving of the Booker--Beryll Bainbridge and Julian Barnes McEwan wasn't even the best of this year's lot. A lot of people are saying that this is a make-up award for overlooking him in the past. The majority of his works just don't scale the heights of literary greatness. They use basic narrative techniques and shick tactics. He does write beautiful prose but his plots and characters are nothing spectacular."
2,Mercifully Quick,"Contrived, characters, flawed plotline, unnecessary descriptions of wine, English hiking and non-existent music end with shuffling invented in Hamlet. This won the Booker prize and people are going around saying om Wolfe doesn't write literature?"
2,A boring book.,"The hype for this book prompted me to read it. Amesterdam is filled with less than inspiring characters who lead incredibly boring, selfserving lives. The recently departed Molly was the most boring, vacant bore of all. I considered putting this book in the recyling bin."
2,A Real Disappointment,"Amsterdam was my first Ian McEwan novel. Several months ago I glanced at a review and when I saw it in the book store and noted that it had recieved the Booker Award I figured it was worth a read. Being rather cautious, I sat in the book store and read the first 5 pages which I found intriguing. However, it seems that the book went downhill from the moment I left the book store. I don't know what kind of criteria the Booker Committe uses, but I just didn't see this book as worthy of any kind of award. The moral dilemna that were suppose to develope just didn't happen. The story had potential starting out, but the author just didn't develope them. Frankly, this is one that I sure wish I had gotten from the library."
2,Not up to standard for a Booker Prize winner,"This is the first book I've read by McEwan -- unfortunately, it was also the first time that I've been really disappointed by a Booker Prize winner. The themes and moral issues raised in the book deserved more thougtful treatment than was portrayed by under-developed and uninteresting characters whom I never emphathized with."
4,Wickedly Rivetting,"This novel is witty, keen, full of social nuance, and sharply crafted. McEwan offers on a platter the paradox of differentiating betweenCONDESCENTION IS THE HIGH PRICE OF ART & LIVE AND LET LIVE.I wish he could have fleshed his characters out a bit more (by making the book longer perhaps), and the conclusion is straightforwardly Cynical. If its purpose was to leave a bad taste, the effect was right on. The concept of social Darwinism is alive and kicking.Overall, a solid work of art."
2,Prose over plot,"I gave this book 2 start since the nicest thing I can honestly say is that the book is grammatically beautiful...but I found myself umimpressed by the tedious way the story was presented. I cannot believe it won an award...It must have been for prose over content. The writing should not have been so self-important as to alienate the reader from the main characters. We really didn't find out enough about the woman that died in the opening scene, but after a while you figure she was probably better off than dealing with her husband and past lovers. They all had little personality and were self-absorbed. It made me wonder why she should have been involved with any of them. The ending of the book was more of a sigh of relief than a fitting ending. I would not recommend this book...I am glad I got it on sale."
3,"Enjoyable reading - no less, but no more","Well written book with an interesting story, centering on the theme of friendship and morale. But what starts off quite impressively turns farcical in the end - and too much so in my opinion. The outcome seems artificial and noticeably contrived. McEwan even starts to explain the ambiguities of English instead of letting them stand for themselves. I am surprised that this won the Booker Prize in 1999."
4,A short but enjoyable read,"The ending of this novel is expertly set up. There were clues strewn throughout the book but it might be difficult to spot the minor details. Amsterdam is a great book to pick up if you want to be introduced to the works of Ian McEwan -- arguably one of the finest writers in the world today. Also, pick up Enduring Love which was surprisingly omitted for the Booker's short list in 1997. Enduring Love is McEwan's masterpiece."
3,"Clever, sad and a bit disappointing","I bought this book because it was a Booker Winner. Rohinton Mistry it's not. Still, I found it enjoyable and the idea behind it very clever. The ending left me feeling let down. The idea, of course, was of a dark novel. But other than a few bon mots I took from it, I doubt this one will illuminate my life. Still, I recommend it because it's fast paced, funny, and smartly written."
2,Amsterdumb,"A beautifully constructed, masterfully written, but at the core, really dumb story. McEwan dared the Booker committee to give him a prize for Amsterdam -- and the committee took the dare. They should have noted McEwan's tacit admission that this novel, like Clive's promising Millenium symphony, just got tired and died."
3,Hopelessly contrived denouement,"If someone had handed this brief novel to me without telling me its author, I would have guessed it was the work product of another Booker Award winner, J.M Coetzee. Booker judges appear to favor novelists who write taut, economical and hopeless tales. While Amsterdam evidences a master craftsman's work in the use of the language, the denouement challenges even a good faith effort at the willing suspension of disbelief. The contrived close is impossibly, fatally flawed by its farfetched implausbility despite the remarkable set-up by the author. The author evidences extraordinary skill in his minimalist style. With only a few brush strokes the characters come alive and are true to life. I haven't read a more lush or imaginative rendering of the composition of music since Proust's rich renderings of the ""little sonata"" of Vinteuil as played by Morel. Bag the Bookers and turn instead to Pulitzer winners, who seem to offer some semblance of a glimpse of hope for humanity."
3,great musical insight,"I love this author. I preferred Enduring Love to this as I didnt always follow the characters and wasnt totally involved in this book the same way as Enduring Love. That may say more about me than the story however. I loved the insight into musical creation through the eyes and mind of Clive, the composer. Obviously, McEwan has studied composition, interviewed composers, or composes himself. Great insight and as a musician, I found this very interesting. Recommened read but I'd start with Enduring and I have yet to read Atonement which Time called the indisputable masterpiece of 2002. Cant wait.."
4,~Two friends and a funeral~,"Ian McEwan weaves a fasinating adventure revolving around two friends, one a composer and the other a newspaper editor whom go to a funeral of an ex-lover. The two men struggling separately in their own careers are forced to deal with their own egocentricities as they become intertwined in a scandal that will affect the future of a third man, a high powered Politician, also a former lover.Layer by layer the story unfolds as the connection they all share with the deceased will change their lives forever as the question of conscience versus ambition plays itself out with each one. It's a surprise at every turn and that is what I personally enjoy about the way the author spins a tale.May I suggest one of his other books, ""The Comfort of Strangers"" which is equally entertaining and captivating about a man and a woman that take a vacation and end up in something like the ""Twilight Zone""."
3,A bit too contrived,"I was not familiar with Ian McEwan's work so I didn't know what to expect. While I found the book mildly enjoyable, I must admit that overall I wasn't particularly impressed. I did really enjoy the character studies of Vernon and Clive. The author displays a keen understanding of their generation and class. However, I found the story itself to be a bit too predictable and the ending unrealistic and forced."
3,Another Booker disappointment,"This is certainly not Ian McEwan's finest work, by a long stretch. Compared to his rich, dark, engrossing symphony, Enduring Love, this is a mere bagatelle, an intermezzo. The portrait of the contemporary composer Clive Linley is well drawn, and McEwan does have insight into the creative process which transfers neatly to a composer. The book is very well written, as one would expect from McEwan, but in the end it amounts to little. It is humorous, but the book is not a comedy. It skirts deep issues like euthenasia and the influence of the gutter press without really probing them deeply or thoughtfully. A good, short read, but hardly prize winning material. Enduring Love was much more worthy of the Booker prize."
4,Really 3.5 stars (spoilers),"This book held me wondering at the end. Ian McEwan has wrote a book that displays his incredible ability to examine the flawed relationship between two friends, and the catalyst for their destruction. However, I didn't care about the characters at the end. He makes them rather unsympathetic creatures (one of them will not go identify a rapist because he has a symphony to finish), so he undermines his brilliant plot, and gives us characters who deserve the ironic ending."
2,Disappointing...,"Ian McEwan is one of my favorite writers, so I was doubly let down by the low literary quality of this book.Don't get me wrong. It starts out strongly. I loved it for the first half, dropped to like by the 3/4 point, and wanted to throw it against the wall when I finished.It's the ending that's so painfully bad. It's contrived, hurried, and predictable - three things I never thought I'd say about Ian McEwan.Such a complicated love story, with a dead woman at its center, should have made for compelling fiction. Add in a vain musician who's far past his prime, a newspaper editor trying desperately to save his own and others' jobs, and a widower aware his wife had had relationships with loads of men and that's a lot to work with.I read the book with several librarians who lead book discussion groups. Though a couple thought the ending was a natural extension of the book, most felt as I did. So, so disappointing."
2,Booker Prize??,"This is one of the most over-rated books I've read in a long time. McEwan is a skilled writer in many respects, but in this novel the characters and themes fall flat, degenerating into the most improbable and unsatisfying climax in recent memory. The moral dilemmas that confront these characters are completely lacking in subtlety and, though McEwan often nails small details in compelling ways, the big picture here seems pretentious and shallow."
3,"enjoyable, but not McEwan's best","This book read like a short story, and perhaps should have been such. I enjoyed it as a fun, quick, dark comedy, but it's probably not something I'll return to. I'm actually a little surprised that it won the Booker Prize."
