1,weird illustrations,"The story is fine - average at best, but some of the graphics are a little on the creepy side for me. For example, there's a scary troll/devilish looking thing on about the 7th page that maybe most parents wouldn't notice, but it's right at a child's eye level when you are reading it to him. There are a couple other things I noticed too.I also thought it looked like some of the graphics were inspired by Finding Nemo and not completely original."
5,Perfect for the job,"I am pleased I bought this whisk for my scrambled eggs in the morning. Less bulky than balloon-type whisks, it is perfect for a smaller bowl of mixables. It feels sturdy and is a breeze to use - more efficient than using a fork to scramble eggs. I haven't ever actually used the up and down motion of the spring like it was designed for. I just use it in a whipping motion because I really don't want a lot of air whipped into my eggs, but if you wanted a fluffy omelet or to beat a small amount of heavy cream, the spring action would work really good to get air in."
5,coil whisk,This will work well for making gravy without a lot of lumps. Thank you for offering a chance to purchase it.
3,Gravy Maker Whisk,"This is a great shaped whisk especially for making gravy. This one is a little small, but does work pretty well. The information provided in the desvription could have been more specific, so you could tell the size of the whisk."
3,Mini Whisk,"While it look exactly like the one we wanted to replace, it was alot shorter, we still like it though."
2,This is a child size!,"I have had one of these egg scamblers for years. Guessing one of my Grandkids must of thrown it out by accident.I expected this to be like my old one, since it looked exactly the same, and I didn't havemy old one to make sure the measurments where the same..What a shock to see this little toy like scrambler.Its a joke I think!I would use the other one for scrambling a doz eggs.This is good if you want to scramble ONE egg.I have quite a few whisks,and I do not consiter this a Whisk!As you go up and down with this it builds up the air, and gets Frothy eggs for scrambling, butbeing its so small, it only works for one or two eggs.I'm so disapointed, I'm sending it back.two Thumbs down"
2,Mine rusted,"It's weird how many reviewers go out of their way to mention that it won't rust, which seems like an odd thing to mention if yours didn't rust. Mine did.Otherwise it's fine, I'm careful with it now."
3,Chocolate?,"Where's the chocolate? When I could study the list of ingredients, I couldn't find any cocoa or chocolate. Not bad as a cake icing."
1,Don't buy it,"The packaging is so stylish and modern that I had high hopes for this CD ROM, but I was wrong. It's far too simple, the interface is ugly and the background music (which you can turn off at least) is annoying. And occasionally it even provides incorrect answers! My kids never use it and I'm sorry that I bought it.Where are the fun, intelligent educational software titles these days?"
3,Very delicate,This is a very thin delicate ring. The fingers are to long and ends have rough edges that allow forsnagging clothing. I have ordered from this company before and been happy - I love the designof the ring but would like for it to be thicker - the hand a little bit better designed even at a highercost. Not an everyday ring.
4,A balanced portrayal of a complex character,"Walter Wangerin deftly exploits many voices from varying strata of society, and of differing convictions, to portray how the famous apostle to the gentiles may have been viewed by his contemporaries. As with ""The Book of God"", Walter Wangerin's writing style is sufficiently engaging to keep the book moving along and make what could be a ""heavy read"" interesting and digestible."
5,Really strange... but it was a very interesting book!,This book was really strange from the begining to the end. This book kept me thinking about the how the murders were happening. It all started when two girls named Nicole and Lucy switched bodies and that was very strange because it was really strange. Nicole wants her body back because Lucy is starting murders.Nicole sees the police but she didn't murder her anyone at all. She asks her friends if they ever saw Lucy so she could talk to her about wanting to switch back to her own body again.She really wants her own life back so she tries to talk to her. She remembers that she is in Lucy's body but the police thinks that she did the murders. Then one day she saw Lucy and she was happy to see her.Then Nicole found herself at a hospital because she was having nightmares and she was suffering from hallucinations.This book was very strange because I couldn't stop reading it!
1,Scary,This is not like the classic r l stine books..I recommend it 4 young adults or teenagers. I read it and it's more violence then scary..r l Stine is suppose 2 write scary books not violent books.
3,The ending was genius.,"The ending was actually the best thing about this book. R.L. Stine is stealing my writing ideas. I had a short story written with the EXACT same ending as this one had, which is why I picked up this book in the first place. My friend/critic kept telling me about this conspiracy, and I knew I had to see it for myself. Yes, even though it's R.L. Stine, which brings back memories of being young. VERY young. I don't remember any of the Fear Street books, but I DO remember that all of them were exactly the same. A bunch of stupid little teens are murdered by the person you'd least suspect, meaning the person you'd MOST suspect, if you had the hang of the books. Switched, however, was nothing like these pieces of idiocy. It was actually a nice read. I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it. I AM amazed that Stine thought of an ending so much like one that I had though. It makes me feel somewhat unoriginal. Heh."
2,TO WEIRD,"The characters in this book were hard to relate to. Although throughout the book I didn't really mind it, I really hated the end. It really spoiled the whole thing and was dissapointing."
2,I was very disapointed with this book,I thought that this book was kind of stupid. RL Stine could of written a much more realistic story than this. An one other problem is is that when Nicole and Lucy switched bodies it happened too soon in the story. The only part I kind of liked was the ending but even that was kind of a snooze. So HELLO! why would anyone want to read a story with a stupid beginning and a stupid ending and an unrealistic plot? So overall this book was a HUGE disappointment to me. R.L. you are my favorite author and I know you could do a better job than this!
4,Great for the price!,"I first looked into these types of products because I bought better ones (Kim Hotstart) for diesel engine-generator sets that I manage, but didn't want to spend >$100. I found the build quality to be surprisingly good (but not great) on these and was pretty easy to install. I measured the cord length and mine was only 3.5' (advertised as 4')and just barely reaches the grill on my car.Just a quick note for anyone who may be concerned that 60/80W is too much for the battery at certain times of the year. I had this same concern (briefly). Look for a dimmer extension cord for lamps that will allow you to throttle down the power if you think you need to. Also, you should realize that the temps under your hood during operation are going to be much more than the highest temp that these things will reach just sitting there warming. I measured mine with an infrared thermometer at 115 deg F max (surface of the pad)."
3,almost a perfect product,"This electric battery blanket worked fine out of the box. However, the chinzy little wire tie they sent to hold it to the battery works poorly. This thing simply needed some velcro on the ends of the battery blanket to make it a very easy and reliable installation.Good try, but no cigar"
3,Kat 22200 80 watt battery heater,I wish it would have been longer as I have a big battery in my diesel and it only covers 3 sides of the battery. I only used it ounce so far so I have not given it a thorough enough test to make a rating on it.I do not know if they have bigger ones then I got but I should have gotten something bigger.
1,Failed after 5 minutes,"Very disappointed. I installed the heater, plugged it in, it heated for approximetly 5 minutes and quit heating. I thought maybe it was thermostatically controlled, so I parked it outside in 15 degree temperatures overnight. The next day I felt the battery and the heater and they were not any warmer than the ambiant temperature. The heater worked for about 5 minutes and failed."
1,Failed after one week,"This item failed after a week. Unfortunately, I did wait a month to notify amazon and it was too late. This item should not be sold if it has no warranty and no opportunity for replacement. Bill Simons"
3,Fly! - If you can.,"I have to say that Fly! Is a simply amazing simulator, with realistic flight models and some great features that others don't have. It's truly a joy to use - when it works. Unfortunately, that isn't often. From machine to machine results vary of course, but on my PII 300mhz, with 3d vid and 32mg memory, I found myself hitting the reset button about 3 times as often as completing a flight. Some I've spoken to have been unable to get the program to run at all. The patches that TRI have released have fixed some problems, but not nearly all, and they have a lot of technical work to do if they plan on getting Fly! Into the same league as FS 2000."
5,A flight sim that grows on you,"Though I started with Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2000 (FS2K) and Combat Flight Simulator, Fly! is my current favorite. Fly! doesn't have great beginner tutorials the way FS2K does, but it have the following advantages, in my opinion: 1) Fly's photo-realistic terrain beats FS2K at any altitude above 1000 ft. 2) Fly's cockpits and startup procedures are more realistic 3) FS2K doesn't have ATC, as others have pointed out. 4) Fly has a much better manual, though FS2K users can get similar quality by purchasing Ben Chiu's FS2K guidebook. 5) On my 500 MHz, ATA 66, Win98SE system at least, Fly! has better framerates and stability than FS2K. I can pull up as many secondary instrument, map, vector etc. windows in Fly as I want without stuttering."
3,Definitely Not The Best I've Played...,"From the beginning, this game starts off difficult. The cars in this game have particularly weird handling, the feeling just isn't right, especially if you play the previous Need For Speed games, on either computer or game consoles. I liked the graphic detail of the game. It was smooth and everything just flowed, no matter the high settings I set game options to have. Another feature about this game that I like was the selection of cars to race. However, I really would have liked to see some commuter cars that we normally see out there, to have cars that games like Grand Turismo has. I believe that would be nice. And also to have the ability to supped up the cars too. Those are what the things that have been missing in the Need For Speed series that I would definitely like to see in the future."
1,Need For Speed: High Stakes,Do not know anything about the game....... Could not get it loaded on any computer. Intel II450 32 mg video to a AMD 600... E/A WAS NOT MUCH HELP EITHER.....
3,Great but not so great,"This game is a fun game, only if you have a good computer with all of the requirements only a lot higher. When I play it, the graphics are terible even when I set them to the highest setting, and the races skip on you. This could be because of my computer, but I have a 98 hewlett packard. Besides the graphics and stuff, the game is awsome. You can download cars and tracks, and you can also win tracks and cars by winning the races against the computer. It keeps the competition going. There is also hot persuit where you can be the police or be run from them. If you are looking for a hot racing game I would recomend Need for Speed 3 or 4. I would not get Need for Speed High Stakes (4), unless you meat, or pass all of the requirements."
4,Great Game,"I am a fan of racing games. But I don't really know how detailed I can get on the reality of this game. I don't have anything to accelerate my graphics, and I run all of it off a labtop, so I guess I ain't gettin all of it. But what I do get is awesome! There are so many cars, and they aren't from just 5 companies, there is loads. They even got Mclaren in there. When you just look at your track selection on the main screen its kinda disapointing. But there are loads to unlock, maybe even more then they give you straight away. I own a sidewinder joystick from Microsoft but I find it really hard to use on this game. Downloading the cars from the wesite never worked for me and I have a DSL line, but I don't know about anyone else. Midtown Madness is better but this still is a really cool game."
5,Intenese,"I think this was a very good game,I have it on the playstation also! My friends and I race often and it is always a favorite, due to the INTENSE racing you can have on two player. NFS"
4,NFS HS : In a class by itself,"As an avid driving sim gamer, I love the NFS series. The latest in this series, High Stakes, has great tracks, good special effects, and a killer Hot Pursuit mode that lets you chase or be chased. But, I have to say, the cars could look better. I guess I have been spoiled by Need for Speed 3. Don't get me wrong, any of the NFS games are better than any sim out there, but I still find myself playing NFS3 more than this one.As with 3, you can download cars, or even build your own! And a great plus about High Stakes is that all the tracks that are in 3, are in this game. All in all, it's still a must have!"
4,Full of Challenge!,"This game has lots of modes like Career Play (buy cars and pay for the damage), Hot Pursuit (runaway from the cops or become a cop and chase speeders), Knockout & Tournament. You can race a Ferrari, Mercedes, Lamborghini, Porsche, Chevrolet, BMW, Jaguar, Pontiac even a McLaren. Plus you can download cars from needforspeed.com. Yet the game lacks graphical inprovement from Need For Speed III: Hot Pusuit (some tracks tend to be dark and gloomy). Some features are: you can listen to music from your own CDs, night racing & race a friend on the same machine."
4,Nice,"After my friend let me play the game at his house it was very, very fun. It's very cool how your car gets damaged, but you should be able to choose a ""no damage"" option. The grapics are great,but the Lamborghini Diablo SV looks like a monster truck, cause of the LARGE wheels(that's the weird part). The cars look more realistic in NFS 3. NFS 4 is fun to play because of the:skid marks, dirt smoke, the look of the damaged cars, and the variety of cars. The cop mode is also very enjoyable. For high speed action, this game is for all you car lovers."
1,Not really sure why,Not really sure why someone uploaded a picture of the CD when this is really about a book. If someone could tell me where to find the CD on Amazon...
4,an excellent overview of an important subject,"Nadine Strossen provides a chilling account on how sexual expression is under attack by a bizarre alliance of radical feminists and right-wing lunatics. She devastates the Mackinnon-Dworkin procensorship position, pointing out its glaring legal and common-sense errors. She shows how censorship harms women more than pornography, and how attacks on pornography quickly mushroom into attacks on all forms of sexual expression. Anyone who values his or her freedom needs to read this book. It is aimed at a general audience and does not contain too much technical legal analysis."
5,I remember this!,Stumbled upon this when looking for gifts and was dellighted to find this classic account. Nice to bring it to today's school child.
4,Very nice book,"This is such a neat book - the infamous poem is awesome on a plain sheet of paper, but the drawings in this book just make that poem come to life so very well. It's a very interesting, quick read, and an absolutely FANTASTIC way to introduce such a classic poem to your children. It's LOVED in this house and it's so much fun hearing it recited from memory from little ones. Great, great book, highly recommend!"
5,Treasure of Your Love,"Treasure of Your Love was one of the very first 45's I remember my momhaving. It has been a life long favorite of mine,and am thrilled to get this cd for my birthday.It is fabulous !!It is so rare to see anything by Eileen Rodgers.I just turned 59 and still have this tune in my head from childhood.The entire album has great sound and selection.I got the Blue Swing album also,very,very good also !Thank you Susan for this great set.The Big Hurt by Toni Fisher and Treasure of Your Love by Eileen were myfavorite childhood songs."
5,Eileen Rodgers,This album is the best music purchase I have made.I have played this album almost every day; it is now on my ipod;This lady has the best and most pleasant voice I have heard.The service from Amazon was also amazing. All the was from America to Australia in a couple of days - amazing.
2,Invites Comparison????,"The Review at the top says:""the author's work invites comparison with that of Robertson Davies.""Invites comparison? Anyone who has read ""World of wonders"" by Davies would , i think,upon reading ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" use a different term than ""invite comparison""...one wonders if Davies estate lawyers have not noticed ..."
2,Couldn't get into this book,"The story ideas sounded good, but in reading them, I was bored.I saw ""The Illusionist"" and really liked it. This is one case where the movie is better than the written story."
4,A Microscope on the World,"Amazon led me to Millhauser's work through a winding maze of postmodernist writers, and I was pleased to have discovered him. His trademark seems to be exhaustive inspection of detail -- the detail of a puzzle piece, a dusty corner of a library, the curves of a woman yet unknown. This volume is worth reading solely for the first story, ""A Game of Clue,"" which simultaneously describes a family conflict during a session of the classic board game, and the action of the episode of Clue itself, complete with the twisted seduction of Miss Scarlet by Colonel Mustard. Ultimately, Millhauser's stylistic microscopic detail grates on the brain, and it best taken in small doses. However, this author clearly takes great pains to birth his work, and students of fiction can learn from his carefully crafted approach."
1,Narrator is hard to follow,"my 1 year old loves the Ringo Narrations, he will not watch this one with this Narrator. The Narrator is all over the place, and his voices are dumb. I cant even watch it because it makes me go insane. I love the Ringo ones and so does my 1 year old. This DVD is going right up on Ebay."
4,Hot Tudor nights--hope it reprints or you can find it used,"Unlike Ware's The Binding Contract, I really enjoyed this book. The fiction was good, the erotica was hot, the resolution satisfied.There is a bit of time-travel in this, hinted at in the title. It requires no machinery, and is rather more like the process in Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return (in film, called Somewhere in Time). It worked without making me roll my eyes heavenward.I did roll my eyes heavenward for other reasons. The bdsm erotica was hot--not simple torture, where the woman is merely maimed as opposed to aroused and well-brought-off. The heroine has a love/hate relationship with the pain/pleasure switch, and the plot kept me guessing as to what might happen next or last.The only downside to this was that once Tab A was going to get near Slot B, it often seemed to be the same sequence of what gets handled how.I hope she writes more like this one."
1,"WARNING on ""Remanufactured toner cartridges""","Absolute garbage ""re-manufactured"" toner! When these are done badly they ruin the drum and that cost $140 to replace! My stupid! Bought one from Amazon seller bestofficestore. My laser drum was new and now it is ruined. I should have learned before that you have to buy REAL toner and not this garbage, cheap refilled ones.As soon as I put it in the first copy came out with a black stripe on one side. Nothing will fix it--shaking, corona wire, etc. It gets gloppier and ploppier until I have to take the whole thing out and shake to make it tolerable for a few more copies. It isn't worth is to try and save $30 with these and ruin a Drum. Then you need a new drum + new toner! Seller bestofficestore is a joke. More like worstofficejunk.Now I've done my civic duty to warn you."
3,"Wonderfully funny, but flawed","I read this set of five novels over last Thanksgiving, while cooped up in a car with the 'rents on a trip to visit my sister. It was my introduction to Wodehouse, and served me well in that capacity. I very rarely laugh out loud at books, and I did so several times while engrossed in this collection. But... reading five Wodehouse novels in two days makes you realize just how formulaic the characters and plots can be. Essentially Wodehouse novels are the literary equivalent of sitcoms. Very good sitcoms, to be sure, more on the order of ""Frasier"" than of ""Friends,"" but by the time you read the fifth novel in this book, you won't be surprised by any of the plot's turns. My advice -- don't read 'em all at one sitting, and you might enjoy the experience more."
4,Let Plum be Plum! As Always...Great Fun!,"I was more disappointed with the reviews of this book on Amazon.com than with the book itself! O.K., maybe it is ""post-war angst"", maybe it's the Long Island malaise, these stories are a bit darker than the ""classics"" of Blandings Castle or the Drones Club.But, dash it, they are Wodehouse and show an important part of his personality and the personality of his wonderful characters. Imagine a Jeeves-on-loan! Brilliant! It proves that Jeeves isn't only Jeeves at Bertie's side.By the way, isn't ""Bill"" Shannon (aka, ""The Old Reliable"") an lovely example of the modern, liberated woman! ""The Butler Did It"" also takes a deserved, but painless, whack at modern art.Don't let preconceptions tarnish what could well be ""five of the best"" from the master.I enjoyed them immensely."
5,The butlers definitely did do it!,"This collection of five P G Wodehouse novels is positively teeming with butlers, old butlers, young butlers, fat ones, thin ones, rich ones, poor ones, even some with shady pasts! The collection includes:THE RETURN OF JEEVES: Bertie Wooster loaned Jeeves out the Earl of Towcester while Bertie was otherwise engaged. Lucky for the Earl and his family that Jeeves was there to sort out the various star crossed lovers and shady dealings that were taking place in this stately English country home.BERTIE WOOSTER SEES IT THROUGH: Bertie returns and manages to once again need Jeeves to extract him from the clutches of Florence.SPRING FEVER: A delightfully eccentric British peer competes with his devious butler to romance the cook.THE BUTLER DID IT: A long ago tontine causes strange romantic entanglements.THE OLD RELIABLE: The usual Wodehouse madness transported to the glamor days of old Hollywood."
2,Not nearly as good as I'd expected,"I received this book as a First Edition selection from Book Passage in Corte Madera, CA. Big mistake. I couldn't fnish it. I returned it and bought Tobias Wolfe's latest. Then I read a few reviews...A. Waldman is married to Michael Chabon??You're kidding.He needs to help her just a tad more. A rather large tad.The story seems like it could be a good one, but the writing doesn't measure up, not IMO, anyway."
4,A quick and enjoyable read,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick, enoyable read that kept me interested right up until the end. I was invested in the story and the characters, even if I didn't particularly like all of them."
1,The Result of Literary Nepotism,"A friend gave me this as a present, and I'm wondering what exactly made him think I'd like this drivel. The fact that it's a poorly written soap opera? That it's full of clichés? That the one Latino character in the book is a poor Mexican who ""in desperation"" turns to a drug deal--and ends up in jail? That the mother in the book is a lousy one? (not that this is much of a surprise coming from an author who's made a career out of telling total strangers that if her four children died, she'd be OK; that her daughter was ugly when she was born; that her eight-year-old son thinks he's gay, etc.)Michael should be a nicer husband and help his wife with her books, since she can't write to save her life. Then again, if the author weren't Mrs. Michael Chabon, ""Daughter's Keeper"" would have never been published. I guess that's enough help there."
2,"No, no, no, no, no","Ayelet Waldman should stick to practicing law. As a writer, she's so obviously riding the coattails of her husband, Pulitzer winner Michael Chabon, that she's become a literary embarrassment. There are writing friends of mine who write FAR better than Ms. Waldman, but will their books ever get into print? Heck, no. In fact, it's highly doubtful they'll ever even land an agent. Did Waldman have any trouble selling her book? You can bet your sweet bippy she was ushered into the head honcho's office and plied with wine and jumbo shrimp - all the big guys aching to make nice over the wife of a justly famous man. The book itself deals with serious and important material, but Ayelet Waldman is not the writer who should be carrying this flag.Please, folks: don't waste your money. I gave it two stars for the content, but I wouldn't award even one star for the writing itself."
2,"Good plot, bad writing","The subject of this book is very important and told with a social conscience, but oh goodness, Ms. Waldman writes fiction like a ballerina wearing a scuba suit. I don't know whether to applaud her social conscience or ream her for what she's done to the minimum standards generally accepted in the world of fiction. A recomended read, if you promise not to think this is an example of wonderful prose or ignore the fact that she probably had a little advantage getting started. In time, her style may improve. Her heart is already there."
2,Not bad for a first draft,"While the concepts in this novel are admirable and even inspiring, I have to agree with the readers who have negative things to say about the mechanics of the writing. The lack of attention to basic principles of fiction is likely to make many readers cringe, as I did. It reads in many places as though it simply wasn't edited.Contrary to what a couple of readers have suggested, I understand Ms. Waldman did endure numerous rejections of this manuscript. I am however surprised that her publisher didn't insist on some more work before arranging for it to be printed. There are indeed many well written books out there (including unpublished ones) and there's not much point in spending your time with a writer who hasn't taken her readers seriously enough to learn the craft before marketing her work."
4,Glad I gave it a second chance,"I couldn't get into the first essay, so put the book aside for a while. I tried again, wasn't really into that particular story at any point, but kept on going with the book. Surprise - the rest of them were fairly interesting!"
4,Great continuation offering new information,Even seasoned veterans will have questions. This book does a great job at answering many of the questions we all may have about riding motorcycles. Everything from the basics to advanced riding techniques is covered and with Keith Codes name on it you know you are getting quality information. I recommend this book along with Twist of the Wrist I and the Soft Science to Road Racing Motorcycles.
4,Great info.,"The book is full of great information. I had a problem of second guessing myself to the point of error after reading the book. I recommend applying one principle at a time or better yet, after reading the book evaluate yourself then work on the problem area's one at a time. I also recommend getting the DVD, it is a great supplement to the book."
5,"If you ride a sportbike, you should already own this book","You. Sportbike. Riding. Canyons. Track days. This book is your bible, your guide, and holds the answers to your sportbike riding questions. What do you mean your don't have it yet? Buy it!!!"
5,Awesome info!,"I highly recommend reading Twist of the Wrist for any rider. It will help new riders understand the physics of how the bike works in turn dismissing some of the common fears associated with riding. It will also help more experienced riders become better in corners, thereby improving time and safety. I also recommend supplementing the read with watching videos on cornering techniques as it helps cement the ideas."
5,A PLOT THAT TWIST AND TURNS,"Following my first time at a track day - I was frustrated. I didn't have fun and I didn't know why. I was slower than most, despite my 169hp of Honda. I was close to giving up - thinking riding just wasn't my thing. Soon afterTofW2 arrived and I started to read. I went out on my bike and was immediately better. I went around bends, quicker, safer and got bitten by the bug. Two books and 3OOOk's later I'm loving my riding, learning more and am rereading this amazingly helpful book. Simply, anyone with a sports bike should read this book, but only if you want to get better."
3,Code's most useful text for street riders,"""Twist II"" contains the most useful information to street riders, out of Code's three ""twist""-series books. (""Twist of the Wrist"" and ""Soft Science"" are decidedly more racetrack-oriented books and aren't really applicable for street riding, but if you race then those will be useful to you!) Code's discussion of Survival Reactions or ""SR's"", and his explanation of the results of applying certain inputs (brake, throttle, steering) to your motorcycle, in various situations, are the two most useful topics of this book, and are worth the price alone, whether you race on a track or ride on the street (and make sure you never confuse the two! ;-)"
3,more of the same,"if you liked the first one, you will probably like this one too. I don't think it added a ton, but was still helpful, particularly in where you should ""spend"" your focus while riding."
3,Good Info hidden in horrible text.,"There is good info here on riding. But one must be prepared to dig it out from the mud. What is funny about the book is that Keith goes on to explain the meaning of words like ""depend"" etc. If I did not know the meaning of these words, I would never have started reading his book in the first place! Every chapter needs to be read over and over again to make sense of what the author is trying to say. If you are passionate about riding and really ready to endure any hardship inorder to improve, you can read this book."
5,read to ride!,"if you always felt there was something a little bit off about your riding but couldn't figure it out, this is the perfect book. the writing style is concise and to the point. the book itself is an easy read (the only knock is the grade-school definitions at the end of each chapter). totw2 goes much further than the first issue does and gives techniques that can be used in more universal situations than just the track. it also doesn't have the same condescending style that i felt the first book did.if you're riding a bike on the street or track and haven't read this book, it's the best investment you can make. even if you know 90% of all the techniques he presents here, the extra 10% can slice seconds off of your lap time or make you just that much smoother on the street. being somewhat skeptical of this book after reading the first one (which was a little bit repetitive) i am very impressed with the information in twist of the wrist II. and i've only read 3/4 of it so far."
5,We never graduate,"The more you learn about riding the better prepared you are to ride. Practice, practice, practice and then read some more."
4,A classic,"This is a classic book on riding but it could do with an update. A trip to his school will leave you feeling the same way, yearning for more track time to practice these principals."
5,This is THE book for understanding and developing riding skills,"There is no other publication that has been as well researched or well proven when it comes to the technology of getting the best out of a motorcycle whether it be for street or track riding.The techniques and examples included in this book have been developed by Keith Code over 28 years of in depth and personalized observation, coaching, demonstration and execution. In addition, all of the techniques laid out by Keith are utlized by Keith and his coaching staff at the California Superbike school - www.superbikeschool.com - AT EVERY SCHOOL all over the world. There is no better text, methodology or school - period!If you want to be a better and safer rider, whether on the street or track, whether you are 10 years old or 65 years old, buy this book, and then go to a school - you won't regret it!"
4,Very Informative,"I found this book to cover a different area to most ""technique"" oriented books. It was more about the how's and why's of what we do on a bike and how our understanding of them can make us better riders.Definitely worth buying and reading more than once."
4,"Great book, one small shortcoming.","Since everyone else already covered what this book has, I'll say what it doesn't have. It assumes that you're on roads where you can be assured of good traction. Almost everything I've read herein assumes so. As long as you realize this as you're reading it, it's excellent."
1,"Maybe good information, very poorly written book","This book maybe good for racers, but is of zero value to daily riders and is written very poorly. What these people need is not an independent publishing firm, they need a good editor. They preach a single rule throughout the first half od the book, and repeat it in so many boring ways, with so many boring examples that you do not want to read any more. The side notes that are scattered through the book have no connection to the text, the illustrations are irrelevant, and the stupidest of all are the asterisks, scattered randomly through the text explaining words such as 'Identical', 'Determine', 'Exception', 'Respect'....Conclusion: Go to the MSF training, Mr Code and Mr Chandler need to go to basic writing training."
4,"great tips, strange structure","Code's book is easy to read and very helpful.What I can't quite figure is the way words like 'force', 'emotional' and 'area' are included in the glossary, while there are some more technical terms that are omitted.Otherwise, quality stuff. Humorous, informative and well put together."
2,"If we rode like Keith writes, we'd all be dead","Terribly written book. Has many ideas and concepts I've tried and haven't found viable for me. HOWEVER, two chapters in the book are very worthwhile: 1)The 7 deadly Survial Reactions and 2) the chapter on visual directional control--the ""Two-Step."" These alone make it worth the price of the book. There are many books that teach motorcycle riding techniques far better, that you can actually understand because they aren't written by someone who must have spent his high school career flunking English. Glad it's cheap."
2,"A Needed Book, But Surely The Worst Writing Ever Published","This book has some definite merit; however, readers will most certainly feel that they have earned the knowledge it contains by enduring the book's oppressive style and format. Mr. Code's credentials as a trainer of riders sound impressive and he does seem to understand motorcycles, especially their road-racing aspects. His difficulty lies in explaining the principles and techniques he espouses in a clear, concise manner. Never have I encountered a book such as this one where the writer feels compelled to include definitions for words like ""goals"", ""purposes"", ""exaggerate"", etc. Perhaps the riders he normally instructs abandoned education in their quest for undying motorcycle glory. At any rate, if you can get beyond the book's second-class writing and worse illustrations, there are some ""gems"" of wisdom to be found. Take this book in-hand when you have time to concentrate on what is being taught in spite of how it is stated."
3,Why does the author keep defining common words?,"This book is helpful itself, but there is one thing I just don't understand, why is this author keeping defining very common words like 'force', 'design', 'standard', 'device', 'value', etc....does he have an unfulfilled dream of becoming a lexicologist?"
3,OK,You will lean something from this book. My only dislike is it reads like Cycle World and I am not a CW fan.
2,"If you're a beginner, do not buy this book","This book seems to be only for ""professional bikers"". I'm not a professional (or amateur) racer; I only use my bike inside the city and on highways, so why should I learn taking a corner at 150 mph! It does not cover the problems found in everyday city traffic, so I couldn't get any benefit from reading it. I do not recommend it for beginners and those who want to know more about driving safely in city traffic."
4,Product Review,This is a very good book. I ordered this to prepare for the tail of the dragon and it is on point thanks.
4,A must-read!,"A good book, written in typical Keith Code fashion.. He likes to get into theory, but it's good theory. I must have smacked my forehead at least 10 times while reading, as it brought to light many errors I've made. This is a must read book if you're serious about carving curves and being smooth and safe in doing so! While it is primarily track-based, he does go a bit into street riding, but what you learn is applicable to both street and track."
4,Don't Miss This One!,"I am always looking for the interesting, offbeat and original. This novel qualifies on all counts!"
2,icky,"Be warned! If you're going to read this book, there isn't one comforting, happy, or light moment throughout- it's a dark, dark world.I'm not against creepy lit- but this book overdoes it: 2 child molesters, a verbal/physical abuser, horrid family relations, centers around a morgue, a creepy narrator, near death beating, beaten to death prostitute, abused dog, a ruined child, & a wretched ending- all of this in 280 pages.I shut the book with an overwhelming 'yuck!'Not recommended!"
5,wonderfully twisted and surprizing,"One of the best books I've read all year. Wonderful, non-stereotypical characters, engrossing situations and full of twisted and quirky surprizes. The Best!"
3,still expecting results,"well, i bought this procerin foam like 1 month ago , just starting my new bottle so far i cant really see results but i know that it usually takes about 2 months to see some results from hairproducts, so will see what happens.. i can say its easy to use and its not too sticky.. and twice a day its not bad.."
3,A little disappointed,"I used to watch this show all the time and loved it. It must have been because I was married to an abusive man at the time. I am now blissfully single, and don't enjoy the show as much as I used to. Oh well....I will keep them in case I ever need them again! lol"
3,Not bad.,I didn't realize this was a made for TV movie... but it's not bad. I thought it had a alright story and the ending was good. Nothing great... but can't say I didn't enjoy it.
5,Great Movie!,The movie was terrific. My kids enjoyed it as much as I did and it arrived was aheaad of schedule in excellent condiion.
3,Remember....,...when this movie came out on cable? It brought back memories for my family as well. A little corny at times(maybe overacting)but overall good to have in your DVD collection.
3,Exciting movie with questionable ending,"Exciting movie, although not for young children. The end encourages revenge, which parents may not want their children to see. There is blood and gore, and shocking twists."
5,Best thriller movie I have ever seen!!!,"I was 13 when this movie played on HBO. This movie was a suspenseful, scary, exciting, make you wanna come back again and again movie. An excellent perspective as to what the human mind and body will adjust to under such circumstances. The will to survive and conquer is most excellently portrayed through each character. To the powers that be, Re-release this movie!!!!"
4,I've been looking for this movie.,"When I saw this movie I was young -10 yrs old. Probably too young to have been watching it, but I loved it, HBO back in the day use to play the hell out of it. The masks that the kidnappers wore scared me to death, especially Father Christmas. I would love to see the movie again, but on DVD -wishful thinking I know! If anyone remembers that movie good the way I do, you will remember the song that the children kept singing""I'm the king of the castle, who'll burn the dirty rascal, who'll burn the dirty rascal, who'll burn the dirty rascal"""
5,please re-release this movie,i remember watching this movie with my mom when i was young. i remember getting so scared at the thought of the characters having to swim under this rock to get out of the cave. it is a very suspenseful movie. i would really like to see this movie again. please release this movie so we can all enjoy it and for those who have not seen it yet get the suspense that i did.
4,Watch the packaging?,"Just an FYI. When I ordered the DVD ""The King of Rumble"" I was informed by your website that I could get another DVD to complete my collection of the history of Link Wray. This was a special 1/2 price deal so I said ok. It turns out that ""The King of Rumble"" and ""The Rumble man"" are the exact same product but with different packaging. The release dates are 2003 and 2006 respectively but the same product nonetheless. It would be a good business practice, at least for this product, to inform the buyer of this information.Regardless of this review I have had a great experience overall with Amazon and I will continue to purchase my media here.Thanks,Gregg Collins"
4,Great antenna for the price,I have purchased two of these Midland units and have been happy with the performance. Nice value for a low price.
1,Maybe I was just unlucky...,"...but mine broke after one use. This is not my first antenna and I am not particularly abusive of them, but the second time I put the antenna on my truck it did not work anymore. Maybe it was bad luck, but the Lil Wil I got to replace it is still kicking, so I'll be staying away from the Midland antennas for a while."
2,Average Performer,"Average Performer: 1. I don't link the way its installed and you have to leave a window open to use it. You need an antenna the most in the bad weather and if you can't use it when you need it the most, then what is the point in buying it. 2. Clarity is OK for the price."
5,Saved a buck!!,"I had an amazing experience on a relatively low budget. I've gone on vacation to various places and spent thousands of dollars but this trip, I was able to budget my money well and experience the best and brightest of London. I feel like I experienced more of the country because I wasn't limited by my budget."
3,Great examples with not so great examples,As a newcomer into the scientific writing world I decided to read as many articles as I could in order to understand how a scientist writes. As with most entities in the world there are two sides. Among the heavy science journals I found the collection of The Best American Science (and Nature) Writing of. . . whenever. These books gave a profound identity to the literary science writer. Such talent is important in these days so as not to cause separation; as if those who can stay awake through an entire article are a better being than the rest. I reached this book after two publications and having been ushered to the doorstep of science writing which shows one the importance of heavy data and equations. Though this book has some fantastic writing it only stands above the surface of an ocean of knowledge. It's good to read but lacks so much.
3,Unique and for a rasta girl or rasta man,I purchased this as a gift for someone. I liked it a lot myself and I would purchase another for myself ---if it had more weight so it would rest nice when worn. A black silk cord works great with this.
4,Awesome,Got my purchase quickly and love the product. Beautiful. Well made. Sizing accurate. Would purchase again and recommend to others.
3,Tiny camera,"This camera is small, but fun. The only complaint is the one button that controls the functions is in a spot that is easy to accidentally depress. Most of the functions have a code that has to be deciphered with a supplied pamphlet, which means you need to keep up with that to continue to use the camera.The supplied tether is a nice length and convenient. The case that is supplied is adequate for the camera, I only wish it were large enough to hold the pamphlet with the function codes.I do like the fact that you can chose between high res and low res images so you can control your storage space."
5,"Compact, delicate, hilarious","When Harold Bloom was asked which books he returns to most often, Bloom said:""I re-read Jonathan Swift's A Tale of the Tub twice a year, but that's to punish myself. It is, I think, the most powerful, nonfictive prose in the English language, but it's a kind of vehement satire upon visionary projectors as it were, like myself, and so I figure it is a good tonic and corrective for me.""In The Western Canon, Bloom says:""Tale of a Tub has always impressed me as the best prose in the English Language after Shakespeare's""These comments drew me to A Tale of a Tub and I was not disappointed. The hilarity flows and never grows repetitive or dull. No part drags. I highly recommend this edition because the notes are very helpful."
3,"A good, but constricted analysis","While Huffman succeeds in analyzing his subject well, he fails to take into account other possible explanations for the phenomena he examines. This may be be fine for an avowed Saussurian linguist, but for those open to descriptivist theories, Huffman's observations fall short of the mark."
4,"a great ""Grand Tour""","This is a great 'grand tour' of some of the virtues, at least the ones that Comte-Sponville deems important. Our views differ on theism and so too our views on the virtues covered. Intrinsically, this is a good detailed summary of the historical views as well to some degree. Much work went into this treatise, but much work remains to be done to fully understand the virtues, and their part in everyday life. If the reader is truly looking for a handbook on living the virtues in everyday life, in my humble opinion, this book will be of aid but will fall short on the answers.Still... an interesting interpretation that will give a different perspective.My Regards"
4,Philosophy for everyman,An interesting exposition on what the author believes to be the great virtues. I found myself both agreeing with and disagreeing with much of what he has written. One note: an unsettling number of non-sentences throughout (sic).
2,overwhelmed,I bought the book because I am interested in the subject but I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the references to other philosophers. It was a little too deep for me.
1,Moralism steeped in Relativism,"I was very disappointed with this ""acclaimed"" author's treatment of ""virtues."" For anyone who believes in absolutes or ""natural law"" rather than relativism when it comes to right and wrong, this is not the book for you. For example, the author explains that sex with multiple partners is OK, as long as it is ""safe sex"" and no one gets harmed. Christians, or anyone looking for absolute moral values, would prefer reading ""Written on the Heart: the case for natural law"" by J. Budziszewski."
4,To live Well,"What a wonderful idea for a book. To bring Philosophy to the masses...Of course one would wish that this book was written in English, rather than a translation of the stream of consciousness that the author passes on as good writing. If it is clarity you are searching for, this is not a terribly useful book. If you are willing to work with the book and be patient in translating what the author intends to say, then perhaps one could use this book as a basic stepping stone to delve more deeply into the essentials of good living."
3,Too much verbiage,There was too much verbiage and concepts explained in a too abstruse manner. These concepts couls have been explained in a simpler manner.
2,what was the point?,I am not sure what the point of this story was. It felt like a made for TV Lifetime movie. Not good at all.
5,A nice addition to the Christmas movies,"I have seen this movie 3 times now and like it more each time. The actors do a fine job of portraying their characters. Yes, the story bounces around quite a bit, but in the end it all comes together. What I just can't understand is why Robin Williams did not want his name in the credits! It is not on the DVD case , nor is it on the list of characters at the end of the movie. He is such a good actor, I wonder why he chose not to be credited...?"
1,WARNING: DON'T BUY A FLEXPAY DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"To think that I bought a movie by what they call ""flexpay"" that will soon after destroy itself within 48 hours makes you think twice about buying at Amazon.com!DO NOT BUY ANYTHING BY FLEXPAY!Now I have to pay to send this DVD back and actually spend double the amount of a DVD of the total of $11.47 -- that wil be over $20. and I don't even get to watch or even keep the thing! And that's a deal? I think NOT! Who thought of this rip-off for the consumer?This ruined my Christmas but at least I can save others from buying by this misleading buy disaster!"
1,Noel Flexplay DVD,"I watched this movie on TNT last night and it was very good.However, I do not find the Flexplay to be a very cost efficient idea. Maybe if Amazon offered free shipping, it would be worth it a little more.The movie is $4.99 and the shiping is $2.98, making the cost of the Flexplay DVD almost $8. You can rent 2 movies at the local video store and keep them for 2 days at this cost.It's a great movie, but Flexplay and the shipping isn't."
1,Noel,"Last weekend I bought the movie ""Noel"" at Walmart. I thought it would be a good Christmas movie for my family to watch. We love to sit down together and watch movies but this one was a disappointment. It was rated PG but to me it was more like a PG-13 rating. It had alot of bad language and scenes about sex and pre-marital sex. After about 30 minutes of the movie I finally turned it off, because it was offensive for my family to watch. As far as I'm concerned it will be going in the garbage. I consider it a wasted $19.99. Wish I had known about it before I bought it. Oh well, maybe this review will help someone else not make the same mistake. That is, if you care about what your family watches.Hope this is a help!Kim"
1,Encourages PIRACY!,"I found an ebay seller who had a bunch of these for a buck each plus shipping, so I decided to get 2- 1 to open and play, and one to keep sealed forever. Got them in the mail yesterday, and opened one of them- the first place it went was in my computer though! I won't give any more details because it's illegal, but suffice it to say that I made an exact copy of the content of this disc that WON'T self-destruct in 48 hours! Bet they didn't count on THAT!Putting more movies out like this would be a great way to boost sales of the supplies needed to illegally copy discs. This idea seems to have thankfully died out though, and most DVDs are priced reasonably enough so that you don't have to copy them unless you're a cheapskate."
1,Do you REALLY want a disposable DVD for $5?,"When used DVDs are $7-$9?Do you really want to create more toxic trash for landfills? Say no to these things, unless you want to see them on the sides of all roads..only not picked up like beercans because there's no recycle value."
1,Movie May be Great...Medium Stinks...,Noel might be a great movie. I'm interested in seeing it. But not on Flexplay.
4,"A ""real"" review","Usually, I find amazon reviews helpful. For this product, these posts are useless. It's amazing to see people's ulterior motives at work. To help others, like me, who appreciate more insightful reviews, I offer you the following link. It's a great article that objectively looks at the pros and cons of the various video rental models. And the good news is, someone working on behalf of blockbuster, netflix, flexplay or the studios didn't write it. I googled Flexplay and Noel and was amazed at how much buzz there is out there. Good luck!http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6596861/site/newsweek/"
1,"Oh good, more plastic to throw away.","Yes, okay, the disks can be recycled. Perhaps 10% of them will be. Even if they all are, it's not like recycling plastic is a hugely efficient process. It still consumes energy and produces waste."
1,A New Scam by Corporate Trolls: FLEXPLAY,"My comments are not aimed about the movie NOEL. This is not the type of movie I would pay to see in any case, but I am very concerned about the Flexplay concept. I love movies. I enjoy collecting DVDs and I do watch them over and over again. Some more than others obviously.I am slightly sickened by the thought of greedy media corporate ghouls sitting around their plush offices plotting how they might convince us poor fools to buy an entertainment product that self-destructs in 48 hours. If we allow Flexplay to become the future of DVD distribution, then we will have sold out once again to these greedy little suits. Stand up for yourselves and say NO to Flexplay!"
1,Review of flexplay,"Flexplay costs $8. I can rent most movies for ELEVEN CENTS!Hollywood video has a plan that you can watch all the movies you want for 3 months for $30. I watched 3 per day for 3 months, so they cost me ELEVEN CENTS each.Even if I want to watch the newest ones that are not included in that plan, there is a rental place near me that costs only $2.50 for a new one with an old one. Old ones by themselves cost 87 cents each.If I like a movie enough to buy it, I watch it over & over (every 4 months).Flexplay is a horrible rip-off for me."
1,Skip it.,Alan Arkin thinks the main character is the reincarnation of his former lover...a little too gay for me; not something I considered in line with a Christmas movie.
2,Cheesy,"Noel is a cheesy Christmas movie and a waste of a decent cast. I like Arkin and Sarandon, but the material they're giving doesnt allow them to do a decent job. All the movie is is bad, mushy lines that fit into a stereotypical Xmas movie. Walker and Cruz are also laying on the cheese, but I dont expect much from them."
4,Great grownup Christmas movie,"Love this movie! I watch it every Christmas & am touched every year by the message. Great actors, good mix of comedy & drama."
2,Would not want to watch this more than once.,"I did not purchase this on the medium discussed in most of the poor reviews (flexplay), but after watching it once, I don't think I would choose to watch it again. So it might be the perfect movie for a disposable medium.The cast and acting were excellent, and the story line ambitious, but many of the loose ends it tried to tie up and connect by the end of the movie were left somewhat unresolved. None of the stories, except perhaps the Susan Sarandon/Robin Williams plot, were strong enough to stand on their own. Presenting them as ""parallel stories"" did not work. And throwing in a few allusions to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" did not work either. This was a disappointing movie with some good talent."
5,Feel good holiday dvd,Saw it once and then couldn't find it until this year. Bought it to always have at my hands for the holiday.
3,FlexPlay is Great!!,"My thoughts....I don't understand the negative comments concerning the FlexPlay DVD's, its as if one person or group were writing the negative review ""Great movie, bad technology, ruin environment"". I look forward to a medium where I did not have to pay the late fees, or drive to return them (while poluting the environment from my vehicle). Our late fees are substancial with kids in the house. (Huge profits to rental outlet?) This would also be a great outlet to replace the online and local rentals - get them in the mail or local store and not return them. Let's have more first run movies, maybe at a better price, lower shipping costs would help too."
5,spirit of christmas,"This is a great xmas pic. The cast is incredible. Susan is flawless. Paul Walker is a revelation in a great dramatic romantic role. Penelope sambas! The stories are real and touching. Six very new york characters, each searching for someone on a christmas eve, find one another on christmas day. Great viewing cuddled up on the sofa with a date or the entire family. Cinematography and music are academy award caliber."
4,An Unconventional Treat!,"Perhaps the most interesting thing about Chazz Palminteri's ""Noel"" is its most unconventional screenplay. Since no one else has given one of the film's sweetest secrets away, I won't do it either, but suffice it to say that there's one more ""ornament"" in this cast.From a young man whose only happy Christmas was one spent in the ER when he was 14 after his stepfather broke his nose, to a lonely, middle aged woman whose altzheimer-stricken mother is her only company at Christmas, ""Noel"" is full of strangely different characters whose Christmas threatens to be full of emptyness, sadness and abandonment.Instead, their lives are transformed by the smallest, most seemingly insignificant acts of kindness-ones they perform for others. They (and we) learn that it is truly in giving that we receive the most.A sweet story, ""Noel"" only asks that we believe in miracles and promises that our faith will make miracles happen. A lovely tale."
3,holiday movie,It was moderately interesting with some slower parts at times. It was in the spirit of the holiday and had a hopeful ending.
1,Wish I could have like this.,"I really did want to like this movie. I had hoped that it would be a Christmas story, but I fail to see what it has to do with Christmas. It could have been set in any time frame and would, unfortunately, have been just as bad. The script was simply poorly thought out, so I can't blame the actors for the failure of the project. Some of the acting was not bad, but none of the actors had anything to work with, and I do not understand why some of these actors agreed to do these performances. I could not recommend this to anyone I liked. If you are looking for a heartwarming Christmas movie, stick to the old black and white Christmas movies. I'm afraid this one ended up in our trash."
1,Why won't it play?,"Circuit City lost millions on a somewhat similar concept to Flexplay a few years ago, though admittedly, CC required special DVD machines for their disposable disks. Why did it fail? A huge uproar over DVDs that would not play, requirement for special players, and a valid concern over millions of these things ending up in landfills and by the side of the road. Consumers spoke then, perhaps history will repeat itself. I'd rather rent or buy."
1,Self-destruct!,Self-destructing DVDs? I've got two words for that idea--In Sane! DVDs are already an overpriced media! And here comes someone with another idea to rip-us-off!
1,What??,I just didnt' get this movie. It is so discreet in what you are suppose to be understanding that I never did. I bought it thinking it was going to a movie of Christmas hope like the previews said but instead it was just weird.
1,Loved the movie on TNT but hate the Flex idea,"I really enjoyed the movie and I would love to share the movie with my mother. But guess what, she doesn't have a DVD player!!!So I guess it's Tough Luck ma!I would have it available on a NORMAL DVD also. The option should be the customer's. Whether to watch it in the movie theater, on vhs, or DVD, and how to spend their money and time!"
5,An absolute must read for every sincere believer.,"Tozer once again did an amazing job on this book.You will want it too be again as thick .It speaks to your heart and soul while reaching your Spirit with a healing balm of Truth.We truly need writers like him ,and less of the fluffy kind.He writes in a way that makes you search your heart,. I praise God for men of such convictions, we do need them in our day."
3,Nice book,"It's a nice book, full of truth. It's free which is great, it's slightly boring though. If you're looking to get something out of it then you will."
3,Great food...terrible price,"When I started buying this for my kittens it was $23/bag. When I returned a couple of months ago to purchase again and saw the HUGE price spike I took my biz elsewhere. The food itself, at least from the west coast plant which is where mine came from, is excellent quality and I fed this to my kittens and fed the dog food to my dogs. However I won't be buying it anymore since the price hike and I actually ended up switching to a local brand where I know exactly what is going into my ""kids'"" food and I'm getting the same amount for $1.50 more. Better deal all the way around.I suggest looking elsewhere for a different food. Chicken Soup is becoming more and more scarce."
1,WORST EVER!,"I purchased this item for my SUV. I installed it exactly as instructed to do so on the instruction page. I had it tuned by the guy at the local truck stop / CB shop. He didn't much care for this type of antennas either.This is the WORST CB antenna I have EVER bought!The range is minimal.The sound is sub-par.The antenna whistles in the wind and is very distracting and annoying!My recommendation ... BY SOMETHING ELSE!Sincerely,Totally Displeased"
1,Don't bother,"I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install."
1,Stay away,"I've installed this antenna per manufacturer specs and tuned using my SWR meter.Performance of this antenna is worse than bad. It looks nice, the hardware quality is poor. The performance is even worse.In open-highway tests, I was able to to QSO about a eighth of a mile--no more."
3,Typical installation,"I have installed numerous antennas and they are all a hassle to snake through the vehicle. Glue has its disadvantages but magnetics on fiberglass doesn't work. Performance is about what I expected, short range, but then most of the time I'm looking at the vehicle I want to communicate with and it works just fine."
3,So i'm gluing things to my car now?,"This is kind of a follow-up on my review of the cb radio I bought with this. Again, this was more of an installation hassle than I expected. If you buy this you just need to realize it means permanently gluing an antenna to your window. . ."
1,Glue on Junk,I purchased this antenna for the ease of installation But i should have spent more and got a better product. This antenna went on my back window of my pickup with easeand stays there but it just doesn't work.I sit in a truck stop with trucks talking all around and it sounds all garbled .I can't transmit at all! For me it was a mistake!
1,Poor quality poor performance,"Poor quality, cheap materials, cheap stuff, and poor performance, stay away from this and spend the extra bucks for something better."
4,Midland glass mount CB antenna,"I have had this items before, in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home. the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed. Works fine, just like the one before. A very eash purchase and fast delivery."
1,Fell apart,Base Mounted cleanly - but the antenna kept falling down no matter how tight i tighten the retaining screw. today i spot the antenna has fallen off and the screw is gone. So i wouldn't recommend this product.
4,Psychic reading,"I liked this book. It gives you some practical things you can do in your daily life to heal and keep youself safe. If you are a ""non-believer"" in psycic matters, give it a read and you may see some truth to it. Keep and open mind."
3,Not as good as it looks in picture,The hose looks just like the one I already had. But when I got it the fittings and material on the ends is cheaper otherwise it works fine.
4,Enjoyed this whole series,David Weber and John Ringo make for a good colaboration. They have never let me down. I always am on the look out for their next efforts.
2,Mr. St. James,"I'm surprised at the many good reviews on this book. Maybe it's just not my style. I enjoyed the book enough to read the entire thing, however, several times, I was tempted to set it aside for a book of greater quality such as Patricia Cornwell or Sue Grafton. I found the story idea to be compelling, but did not find the same with the writing. To me, it seems that he is trying too hard which makes the book almost childish. I did buy both of his books at a book signing and I intend to read the other one even though this one did not impress me. I find that the first book for any author is usually not the best one. Of course, that would be normal as a writer grows and learns during the course of their career. Mr. St. James has promise."
4,An Excellent Book!!!,Riley St. James has succeeded in creating believable characters in an enjoyably supernatural setting. Once I started reading I could not put it down. The characterizations of Fletcher and Jennifer were super as were the supporting cast like Chapman. Very believeable. I especially like the use of the evil and how it extracted it's revenge on the decendants. Very creative. I highly recommend this book for any readers and believers in the Supernatural and horror.
4,Legendary,"Mick Middles biography is an excellent and comprehensive attempt to catalogue the rise and fall of the legendary Manchester band. Fuller than John Robb's book - The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop - Breaking into Heaven: The Rise and Fall of the Stone Roses traces the roots of the band back to the early childhoods of Ian Brown and John Squire through the punk inspired Patrol era to the heady days of 1989 when the Stone Roses looked likely to conquer the world. The portrait of Gareth Evans, the Stone Roses' ebullient manager at the height of their success, is amusing and revealing, and the postscript on Ian Brown's up and down career since the demise of the band is also fascinating. A must for any true Stone Roses fan."
1,Gareth Evens Biography..........,"I thought this might be an insightful book about the ""rise and fall"" of The Stone Roses. Instead I received a literary course in band management. It's too bad Mick Middles could only speak to a bitter and hindsightful ex-manager to piece together such a complicated yet simple story. Had more interviews been done with the band I might have enjoyed the book. In short this book would be appropriate for anyone interested in exploiting a young talented band. For those who are interested in understanding The Stone Roses, buy another book."
3,Jonathan Carroll's writing is just like caviar,"Everyone tells you how good it is, and if you see it at a party you will almost certainly have some, but not many people will drive to the grocery store at midnight to get some.I enjoyed the book and it certainly is well written and contains some absolutely wonderful turns of phrase but it just isn't something that I can get really wrapped up in.The story basically just seems to go along until we reach the end. There are some revelations, some tragedy, some triumph but in the end it just really doesn't do that much for me."
3,"Lots of action, unrealistic characters","Lot of wild, zany colorful action. However, the characters (including the narrator) are flat and act with no emotional consistency. Despite the many ""profound"" realizations, insights, magical occurences, etc., none of the characters really change or develop."
4,would have been a 5 star,Its a wonderful set Iam very pleased with it my only problem was there was no cd in it. and I contacted amazon and they never got back to me so it really ruined it for me I would have enjoyed hearing the music.
1,Unengaging; Falls Flat,"I read all of the reviews praising this book and am puzzled. Maybe I've missed something here, but I couldn't even force myself to read the entire book. By the fifth chapter, I was completely frustrated by the ""flat"" quality of the main character. Unfortunately, the one dimension of the character is his idealism which is communicated to the reader via incessant lecture-like soliloquies. I wondered why I should care about this character... and never did find out.If you're looking for a good example of a writer struggling to find his voice, then this is your book. If not and you prefer more sophisticated and engaging writing, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
5,very good DEA book and software,This is the DEA book has many DEA models that you can apply with the software supplied. The software is an Excel Add-In which can be easily used. The book also has good intro. on DEA. It is a book for both DEA beginner and advanced users.
4,Go Tanya Go!!!,"Great show thats a bit over the top but its entertaining as Hell!Its sad to see a lot of the more familiar actors get written off the show but the new storyline and characters adds so many more new twists and turns. I can hardly wait for season 4 but someone has written it will take 1 1/2 years for it to reach our retail market but BBC America is already selling Season 4 and 5 in Region 2 which doesn't make any sense to us Region 1 fans. Also, bootleg copies are already surfacing on Ebay with enticements like unrated. If you can't wait then go to the footballers wives website and totally spoil it for yourself."
4,Excellent service,"The DVD was well priced and arrived quickly and sooner than I expected. over all, I was very happy with the purchase."
5,Even better than the First and Second!,"I loved it! I bought it from London I was really happy when I found out that they sell it there!There are many new characters and that made it really interesting... my fav. characters are Kyle & Conrad, they are really good.I didnt like the ending...maybe you'll do!I cant wait for the fourth!"
1,Sad,"I can't say I've read the whole book for one reason, the advice is horrible. The technique that Mr. McNeil preaches, to keep your feet together, is simply wrong. It's sad that such poor advice is still being published and unknowing beginners are learning bad traits. Keep your feet apart and learn how to ski."
1,A fundament FLAW!!!!,"There is a very annoying and fundamental flaw of this product - it scratches up the nice front housing of your iPodMini!!The new iPodMini have a brushed metal housing as compare to the plastic front that iPod original have. The iPodMini also lacks the rounded bottom edge of the iPod. Together with the fact that iPodMini fit a lot tighter in the iPodMini-dock than the iPod; the end result, is that this iPodMini-dock will scratch up the bottom part of the front of the your iPodMini.To *see* exactly what I mean, go to ANY Apple-store, and you will see that those displayed iPodMini have a MUCH worse wear on the bottom front housing as compare to the iPods they have in the store!So, BEWARE, if you are considering getting this dock! (What a shame for Apple's ID, industrial-design, team to come out with this after YEARS of good track record!)"
3,Beware = you might need a FireWire connection,"FYI - product description does not tell you that you need a FireWire connection if you want to use the dock for charging AND syncing (if only to sync, it'll work). My computer is not in good enough shape to be installing a FireWire port, so the dock is going back :("
2,Be aware,"I recently bought an Ipod mini and I was looking for a way to charge it while I was away on trips and I figured the dock could charge it as it says in the description. Of course I didn't read close eneough to realize that it doesn't come with any cables and you still have to be connected to a computer to charge it. I was looking for a way to charge it without a computer. OOh well now I'm stuck with a dock that doesn't really do anything for me that I could've done without the dock. :( I can say I feel this could be one of the stupidest purchases I've made in a long time. I would return the item if I could. Of course it does look nice in the dock, but I'm looking for more than just nice looking, I was hoping to be able to charge it without a computer!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to use so I didn't have to keep switching the sync cable from my computer to the charger and back again. This description is right off the apple website: ""dock makes charging and synching a simple, one-step operation."" Plus it comes with no cables, a total rip off. Basically it's a stand for your ipod it accomplishes nothing more than what your ipod started with. You can plug your stereo right into the headphone jack as easy as the line out so that is no big deal either."
1,"completely cosmetic, not functional","The dock only allows you to stand your ipod up while charging. The same charging cable must be used, and the $40 dock doesnt even come with a new cable. This is an excellent way to waste $40."
4,Necessary evil,"As another reviewer noted, the dock is necessary to play your music through a stereo. The dock provides the required 'line out' function to hook to your reciever. It also serves as a cradle for charging the iPod. A fm transmitter will also allow you to play the ipod through the stereo reciever, but what you get is radio sounding tunes instead of stereo quality.Another reviewer said the dock stratches the front of the ipod. I haven't yet had this trauma, and would probably cry if it were to happen. I push my ipod in at an angle, and it seems to avoid that nasty problem.My only complaint is that for what you have to pay for an ipod, it should be included and not a separate extra. Docks are included with ipods over 15 gigs, so why do the little guys have to pay more?"
4,A really cheesy movie filled with laughs and Judge Reinhold!,"Near Misses is the definition of a guilty pleasure. I know I shouldn't like it, but I do. Judge Reinhold plays Claude Jolbert, a bigamist who uses military reserve duty as an excuse to have yet another affair. He bribes one of his underlings at work, Colin Phipps, with a promotion if he stands in for him at reserve duty. When Phipps is captured by the Soviets though, everything starts to unravel. A series of Three's Company style mix-up's occur as both of Claude's wives come looking for him. And Americans and Soviets alike are made to look like bumbling buffoons. It is really funny and Judge Reinhold is hilarious. I know I shouldn't like it, but I do. God help me I do !"
3,"Great Book, But..........","This is a great book; it goes in great detail about security in all aspects of the computer industry. However it lacks one critical aspect, how do I do that? Like all network and computer professionals, I do not know everything, so when you tell me I should do something a certain way I'd hope that you will also tell me how to do it. With this book I found myself saying, maybe they will tell me what to do later, over and over, never happens. If you want to buy a book that's a reference manual, this is the one to get. If you are looking for a ""how to"" as well as a ""what to look for"" book, consider looking elsewhere."
1,Network Security Kindle Version,"Was better off buying Network Security Paperback, because the ""location progress"" is less friendlier than ""page viewing"" making chapter or page selection a hassle since page viewing is way more convenient than viewing a fraction of a page at a time. The kicker was the Paperback version was $35.88 vice the kindle version was $32.99, which for an epub format wasn't even worth the decision since Kindle is so unfriendly when it comes to viewing the content. Having to buy a Kindle reader to view pages is even less appealing, making the purchase of this book on Kindle a very whack decision. I will now refrain from buying Kindle ebooks and consider paperback versions regardless of the shipping cost and taxes."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT THE BEST VALUE","Yes, this edition of ""Microsoft Computer Dictionary"" has been revised and updated, when compared to the previous editions. Its 10,000 entries centered on software, hardware, and internet terms. They are easy to understand. But the fact that Microsoft stopped adding attached CD-ROMs (with this edition), without any significant price reduction is irritating. It depicts the company's insensitivity to the consumer needs.However, this is not a bad dictionary to use, if you will tolerate this latest arrogance. It contains some new acronyms on XML, Xbox, tablet PCs, and wireless network. But, be aware that there are other computer dictionaries in the market, which offer much more for less money: including attached CD-ROMs."
3,not as good as similar items,"Most of the attachments, like the whisk and swizzle stick, splash too much to be useful.The fan blade works, because it pushes the liquid down instead of up, so there's no splash.But the control, where you have to keep pinching the button all the while you stir is a pain. Especially to mix mousse, pudding or jello where you mix for two minutes.My old one (that I got at IKEA but don't know the brand name) cost half as much and did a better job, plus you could switch it on and not have to pinch the button for two minutes."
4,"frother works great, other tools useless","I bought this to use as a milk frother for coffee drinks. It works great. The other attachments are pretty useless- the beater doesn't have enough power to mix eggs, you could wisk just as easily with a fork. The other tools are even weaker. But as a frother, the stainless steel tool works great and is sturdy."
1,What a disappointment.,"I bought this as a gift. What a disappointment. I am sorry to say it is so cheaply made, it should not be on the market. The contact points for the batteries are flimsy; it's hard to get it into a position to make contact - never could get it to work. And to think that I bought two! I hope the materials can be recycled."
4,convenient liquid mixer,"This power mixer appears to be a good mini blender.It has the compact size making it very convenient for storage and transport.No bothersome cord when using the machine.It also has,suprisingly,alot of power for its minature size with the recommended batteries used.It also has versatile mixing capabilities with different mixing blades which seems to mix thin and thick liquids very effectivly.This mixer is priced very economical and I do recommend this product to anyone."
1,dont even spend your money on this item,"I was looking for a mini mixer that will allow me to prepare my protein shakes in the morning, this one seemed like the one my mom had when I was younger so I went for it. By the second shake it stopped working. I'm returning it, as soon as the ups page that amazon offers to see the return places finally appears, and and going to ask for a new one, just because I want to see if it is a matter of just one mixer or if all of them work as bad. But if you haven't buy it yet, well.... just don't buy it"
2,not happy,Never worked from the start....I advise to purchase a better quality one..I just ordered a new one on this site!!
4,pretty good,"This product is pretty good. At first I didn't think it would be, but when I started to use it, it worked fined. I use it to mix my protein drinks. Be sure to add water then the powder for the best use."
1,you get what you pay for,"Piece of junk. Lasted about 7 months, then the motor quit. One very dead duck. If you want to spend money to buy a new one twice a year that's your choice; but buy two at a time so you have a spare when the first one goes pppfffftttt. I'd highly suggest you be realistic, like I am now, and pay more for something that will last."
4,"When they say ""Mini"", they mean it!","I received my cordless mini mixer today, and was amazed by how small it really is. Those raspberries in the picture should have given me a clue. It arrived in a box the size of a 3x5 index card. I put in the batteries and inserted the whisk attachment, as it is the one I planned to use the most. This was fortunate, because there are no instructions as to how to remove the attachment, and I can't get it back out. Indeed, there are precious few instructions at all. I didn't expect much action, but the little gadget did a nice job whipping up some protein powder and milk in a small glass jar. Obviously this is not the machine to tackle mashed potatoes or cake batter, but it's easy to clean and takes up no storage space. Whether it will last long remains to be seen."
3,A Little Light Weight but Workable,"This product ended up about what I expected: compact, easy to clean, easy size to store in a drawer. I wanted it to mix protein powder in milk. However, it it's a little weak on the torque. You can make it work and I use it every week but you have to be patient. It is still better than trying to use a spoon to stir powder in milk. In a thinner liquid, this would work even better. The other thing that I would have done differently is make the attachments about an inch longer. Attachments are only 3-4 inches long. Depending on the size of the glass, you may have to fill it in a couple of stages as you blend. Two AA batteries don't give you much torque so if torque is what you need, you may need to move to mixer with a 110 volt motor. Amazon sells an Oster Handheld mixer for about $22 that looks like it fills the bill."
4,Mini Mixer,The Norpro Cordless mini Mixer was exactly what I was looking for small job mixing. The price was great and the attachments were an added bonus.
2,Beater is ...beat,"I bought this beater with one purpose in mind. To beat eggs for my morning omelet. This little guy is a handy size and simple to use, but not enough power to submerge in a bowl with two eggs and turn with enough speed to whip the eggs like a want them. It actually bogs down. Forget mixing anything other than thin substances (Ice tea) I got what I paid for."
1,Don't Buy It,This mixer very very weak. It can not even mix some corn flour with some milk!!!!! Although it is cheap but this doesn't justify the poor quality and the very weak performance
1,Dumbest thing on Amazon,"If they were giving these away, they wouldn't be worth the time to order it. Photo makes is look a lot bigger and better. Price should be the first clue as to it's uselessness."
3,Worth the price...but not exceptional,"It feels a bit cheap, looks a bit cheap...heck, it was cheap. But it works well has surprisingly fast speed, lacks torque (power to get through thicker fluids...definitely not shakes), but works as advertised."
4,The little mixer that could,These little mixers fit where the others can not go. I use the slim wand reaching down into the neck of a water bottle to whip up the tea mix I pour in. Great little mixer. Highly recommended. I bought three and gave two away to friends.
5,The Best Little Mixer Money Can Buy,"I've been searching for this little mixer since my original one wore out. I use it constantly! My favorite use, however, is mixing drinks and not just alcoholic. Buy one and you'll be amazed at the many uses you'll find for it."
3,Cordless mini mixer,"I don't know what I was thinking! This battery operated mini mixer just didn't have enough power for my use. So long as you don't try to mix anything thicker than water, it's great."
3,hand held mixer,"Generally I like this mixer , especialy for the price. As noted by others, it can splash in a regular mug, but will not in a tall latte type one. Also sometimes the twirler comes off in the liquid and I had to fish it out. But it is easy to put back."
1,What a piece of junk! Don't waste your money!,This item is a piece of junk! Once you put batteries in it... you will never get it out! What a waste! The battery compartment was designed by a moron! I can't believe that this vendor sells such a poorly made product. I can't believe that there were good reviews... these people are nuts to appreciate a piece of junk!
3,Good For Mixing Coffee Or Hot Chocolate,I'm on my second Norpro mixer but I really can't complain. The first one lasted me about a year of mixing 2-3 large mugs of coffee every day and 3-4 big mugs of hot chocolate a week which I think is pretty good for a $7 battery powered mixer. I've also used the frother to beat eggs for 3 egg omelettes. Don't expect a workhorse because it's not and don't expect much power but the motor wasn't the part that failed it was the switch that eventually died.
2,"Broke quickly, and never worked well","I've had a lot of milk frothers-- they last about a year and need to be replaced. So I tried this one. Not only did it not froth milk for coffee, it broke after a couple of months. I went back to my regular brand-- aerolatte-- which froths and lasts longer."
2,"Good while working, died after a month","The title sums it up. Nice product, strong for its tiny size, but it died after about 4 weeks of occasional use. Would not buy again."
2,Norpro cordless mini mixer,"This - item is so small, I am sure that it is not the sellers fault - but I don't think this could be used for anything other than a glass of milk with chocolate needing to be mixed in."
2,No power,"Its nice and small, and works great when you are not actually mixing anything.I tried to use it to scramble some eggs, it is not powerful enough to actually scramble them.This may work well for true liquids, but that's about it. Actually, I would just shake liquids, so I don't know what I would use this for."
2,"Ok, but not worth it",Attachments not easy to get on and off. Switch very tricky to work - very touchy. Good power for battery operated unit. Cleanability of unit could be much better. But I suppose it's what you would expect for the price.
1,quit working in two days,This mixer is not worth the money. I had it for two days and the motor froze up. The point of attachment for the other pieces is very weak and the power button looks like it could easily break. I loved the mixer for the two days it worked.
1,Do not buy this one,"I have had a Fit and Healthy Portable Drink Mixer for several years. I wanted another one for work. I purchased this item thinking it would be the same as the Fit and Healthy Portable Drink Mixer. It is not. The on-off switch does not move up and down as does the one on the Fit and Healthy Portable Drink Mixer, you press it. It is not well sealed, so I got water in it, it rusted and quit working after 2 weeks, so I threw it away and bought two of the Fit and Healthy Portable Drink Mixers. I can easily wash the Fit and Healthy Portable Drink Mixers without water getting into the on-off switch. My other one has lasted for years. Buy the Fit and Healthy Portable Drink Mixer if you are looking for a little mixer for vitamins and such."
1,This thing is a joke.,"This thing is a joke--perhaps it was intended for a child's toy? I tried mixing 2 eggs with a little milk for an omelet, and it struggled with that simple task. I could not think of any practical task for it, so I finally decided to removed my batteries (they, at least, were worth something) and banish it to the ""junk drawer"". While removing the batteries the thing fell apart in my hands, so I just chucked it into the trash.This contraption should be a total embarrassment to the Chinese who made it and to Amazon who sold it.My advise? Save your money. Do not buy this ""mixer"". If you need a cordless mixer, you might instead consider a Gizmo cordless mixer by Black and Decker. We have had one for years. Ours worked quite well for light mixing jobs until the rechargeable battery finally packed it in. I ordered and got a new one from Amazon, who should NOT be embarassed for selling it."
1,Cheap and hard to use,This product isn't worth even $6. It's cheaply made and extremely hard to use. You get what you pay for. Spend more and get a product that will work better.
4,Overall I like it,"This is a very easy to use tool, worth every penny of my investment. I have not used all the tips (I don't have a clue what one of them is for), but the one I was most interested in, the whisk, is quite nice. It takes a little finesse with thicker liquids, but still does the job for which I wanted it."
3,Great for a while,"This thing worked great for a couple of months, then died. Used it to mix protein drinks and the difference in taste was remarkable. Now I know why milkshakes taste so good. Couldn't beat the price, but if I have to buy a new one every couple of months, I will pay more for a better mixer."
2,Works well for several months but...,"Not a bad unit however when you replace the batteries problems occur. Like it does not work. Poor battery placement, hard to find."
1,Horrible little gadget,The mixer didn't work from the time I opened it. I didn't send it back as it would've cost more to ship than it was worth.
3,What the,"OK it is a cheapo but hey it was cheap to.Works great only complaint is there is no indication as to what way the batteries go in.BUT if you get them in wrong it just seems like ""Wow what a waste of money"" so reverse them and works Pretty darn good for the price.Maybe a bit too fast with good batteries."
2,Woefully underpowered,"Had one similar to this til I finally wore it out. This looks a lot like the one I had, but a different manufacturer. Very underpowered. Has a hard time mixing up anything much denser than water."
1,get what you pay for,Very poor quality. I used it once and it broke.Would not recommend to any one. it did not comewith instructions.
1,Do not buy!!!,"This item is a complete waste of money, dont buy or you will regret it. It didnt work when i got it. I added the batteries and it spun but even in something as thin as water it wouldnt spin anymore. I am so mad about this product"
1,junk,I always read reviews before a purchase. This mixer set is junk. spent about 30 minutes trying to get it to work then pitched it. do not waste your time.
3,Will not whip butter. Will whip egg.,I bought this to make whipped butter. This is not strong enough to do that. It will whip eggs and make milk froth easily and quickly though.
4,The Little Hand Mixer That Could,"I was nicely surprised that there were the different types of attachments included. Nice not to have to pull out a big blender for the ''BulletProof"" Coffee I bought this for. Looking forward to different uses too."
1,No power!!!,No not buy this mixer has no power to mix anything. It even slows down when trying to mix plan water. I would NOT recommend.
4,not bad,"for 6 bucks i got a mini mixer for my protein drinks, it mixes powders just fine. wouldnt try a much more demanding task though. only minus is its battery powered."
5,Amazing tool for such a small price...,"Other reviewers have evaluated this mixer's strengths and weaknesses, but let me just say that for the price (i.e., around six bucks) you owe it to yourself to get one. It is extraordinarily convenient to have this tiny appliance handy when you need do to a simple mixing job."
2,Worked great but broke fast,"I had a couple great weeks of mixing protein powder into juice, soymilk, or coffee for quick, healthy breakfasts, then the motor just gave out. Now I'm using a messy but non-electronic blender ball shaker which works fine but I did find this machine to be truly handy, I could mix right in the cup. Luckily Amazon has great customer service."
4,Mini Mixer,This product is exactly what I needed and works great for mixing a glass full of protein powder and liquid. I would purchase another one.
1,Don't order this item!,"This is like a toy mixer - not even 5"" long.It would cost more to ship it back so will giveit to the grandchildren to play with. Don'tlike it at all!!!!"
2,norpro drink mixer,very cheap product. i bought 3 of them and have used similiar ones for years. they will do the job but you have to constantly fiddle around w/ them by either helping the motor start and/or sliding the switch up and/or down to make contact. spend another dollar and buy a better one or get 3!
5,Small Wonder,"I got this little mixer for one very simple and specific purpose - to thorougly mix veggie juice powder (specificallyGarden of Life Perfect Food Raw Nutritional Supplement, 240 Count) with OJ quickly and painlessly. I use it 2-3 times a day, and it works perfectly. It's actually still running on the original AA alkaline batteries I put in it over a month ago and has lost only negligible power. Bottom line - it costs $6, it does exactly what it is designed to do and does it flawlessly. Can't really ask for much more than that. When it croaks, which it surely will at some point, I'll happily get another one."
3,met my expections,It's good and works for the purpose i bought it for. But the motor wears out in about six months.
2,Funny really,"I've been using the $2 Sharper image frothers for years, they last a long time and work perfectly in milk nuked for 30sec.This doesn't froth very well, but it does get there eventually. The drink mixer is sort of useful if stirring a spoon is just too much effort.The others are ridiculous and just try putting it to an egg...it just whines at you helplessly. Funny and for $5 I don't care too much, but if you want froth for coffee, look to something else dedicated and better."
2,Dissatisfiedc,I felt it was too small. I am sure it is great for the price but I was disappointed. The other reviews seem good
2,Broke after 2 months,Used the frother 2 to 4 times daily for approx 2 months . Motor started acting up. Changed batteries still acted the same.
1,OMG,"Couldn't believe this item was so ""mini"". Not have enough power to be very effective for much mixing of any kind. Pass on this one!"
1,Flimsy and easily broken,I broke this as I was taking it out of the package. I didn't pay much for it but I found it to be useless.
4,IT'S DEFINITELY A MINI!!,"I had no idea this ""mini mixer"" was so small when I ordered it. That said, it does what I wanted it to do, which is to whip up two or three eggs for an omelet or scrambled eggs. The inversion blender that I have (and love!!) was really too big for that particular job. This little bit of nothing does the job. I had a hard time figuring out how the batteries went, until I realized that the instructions were on the side of the inside of the casing. During the process of taking batteries in and out, while trying to figure out which end went where, I caused the plastic casing to separate somewhat on the seam. However, that's what duct tape is for, right!! Batteries inserted properly, duct tape holding the bottom together, and off I go, whipping up eggs tonight for those omelets!! I think the price is fair enough, considering that I paid no shipping."
3,mini-mixer,"The batteries were really hard to put in as there were no - or+ signs to follow. Also, when I put the mixer part in, it stayed in. The attachment & a part of the end that holds it comes off together, therefore, I can't use the other attachments. The mixer works well, however. Lee Ford, Scottsdale, AZ"
2,Doesn't mix very well,"Despite the reviews, this mixer did not perform to my expectations. I was using it to mix protein shakes but it barely mixed any of the protein powder. I moved it all around, pulsed it, and stirred it but it still didn't not mix it very well. It seemed like the motor did not have enough power. It kinda felt like a kids toy actually. Only reason why I didn't give it one star is because it was priced properly: cheap for a cheap product."
2,Extrapolating History,One of the great logical fallacies is to reason from a particular premise to a universal conclusion. Much of this book is based on that logical fallacy. Yes some people were starving and some planters were not planting food but extrapolating to a universal conspiracy of the rich against the poor is illogical. A Peoples History of the Civil War is not balanced. It is an attempt to make everybody with any power look evil and it contorts history to accomplish its goal. If you want to see the US Civil War through a Marxist lens then read this book but there are better books to read about the Civil War that give a much more balanced view.
5,Nellie Wildchild,"This was the first EMMA BLAIR book I'd read, I couldn't put it down. I have read 6 more of her novels since this one.She writes in the style of Catherine Cookson with more gutsy details.At first you'll laugh being out with Nellie Thompson and her friend Babs at Saturday night dances.Nellie falls for Frank, but he's a Catholic. Her father is furious; they want her to marry Jim.After Frank is forced to leave town Nellie relents and marries Jim, what a mistake she's made!"
2,Misleading title but otherwise good book,"A more appropriate title would have been ""history of fighter design"" Does not truly cover design fundamentals - more like a history of its development. Does note provide any new insights on aircraft design or an in depth look at how different tactics/ operations/ stratergy affected fighter design and how these needs and requirements were met with which design philosophy."
4,not too shabby...,"This book has lots of history, even about WWI & 20's-30's fighter aircraft. Unfortunately, the author is British so much of the history focuses on British and German aircraft, which most Americans (including myself) are probably unfamiliar with. The color photos are nice and overall technical content is enlightening. I do feel that the book would benefit from a chapter of technical material explaining things such as wing-loading and its importance and some light engine/propulsion theory as some terms are not explained effectively which makes the discussion hard to follow.Overall, it's a good read for someone interested in the history and development of fighter aircraft."
5,Easy to install and use,"Took only minutes to install, worked great in multiple computers of mine. Upgraded my old computer to usb 2.0 so I could load my ipod alot faster."
4,Decent Card,"This card works great if you need some extra USB ports. I bought it becuase I needed some extra USB ports for my scanner and printer. I have a dual-booted system with Windows 98SE and XP, and it worked flawlessly on both without the need to install drivers. All you have to do is plug and play!Only problem I have is that the card only has 4 ports. It may be advertised to have 5 ports, but the 5th port is internal rendering it almost useless. That aside, the card runs very well.Since I updated my PC I no longer need this however..."
4,The order of the poems matter,I give the book four stars because of Larkin's verse. However it is not clear to me that the editor has paid attention to the order of the composition of the poems. This is a matter often neglected. It is important when reading a poem from a book of poems--say High Windows--to know what poems surrounded it. The editor does provide the original order in the back--but the order of composition matters or rather the arrangement of poems that the poet produces matters--if Larkin wanted a certain order it was because he felt that the poems feed off each other in a specific way. Reproducing the poems willy nilly destroys the pattern of the poetry.
1,Misleading,Why does my version of this very book by Thwaites only contain 120+ of Larkin's poems and not the full 240 or so. Pretty lame to advertise it as otherwise Amazon. Pretty lame.
2,Lame Larkin,"I am one of a growing number that find Larkin lame and flaccid. You read, you understand, you move on. There is little to struggle over, nothing one wishes to reread. Simple poems of a lost England."
1,Horrible,"This poetry has no redemption or beauty. It is dry, sarcastic, dismal, and plain out unhealthy to the mind. It's not worth it. Read poetry that moves you to understanding, not this."
5,Prufrock,"The poetry explores themes of love, loss, loneliness, death, aging, and everything in between. Larkin unashamedly uses rhymes and iambic pentameters in modern times when these structures are considered out-dated and gauche. However, they only draw the reader deeper in the (deceptively) easy lines of the poems, lines which once you read, you could not shake off for the rest of your life.Larkin hasn't been the most prolific writer and what he writes is usually short, terse poems. He's bitter, selfish, and trapped in his own world but yet he is like Prufrock, the readers grow to love him, to empathize with him.The poems, arranged in chronological order, shows Larkin's progression as a poet."
5,Philip Larkin: Collected Poems,"I am not a poetry lover, by past personal history. When I told my wife of hearing a Larkin poem read and liking it, she decided to buy the book for me. Larkin's poems include some with stunning imagery and blazing emotion; his skills with lovely language are a marvel to me. I am not impressed with all of his poems, but some are so good I want to immediately pass them on. If you can find a sample of his work, I hope you enjoy it."
4,ok product,"generous size, somewhat stiff fabric, color as pictured. Quality is decent, although buttons fell off right after the first wash and dry."
5,Yamaha S115V replacement,"Perfect fit. I haven't been able to notice any audible difference between the Eminence Kappa Pro and the stock speaker. There are a couple cosmetic differences - stock speaker had a polished outer ring, Kappa Pro is all black. Stock speaker had smooth cone, Kappa Pro has several raised rings. Also, connectors are different. Stock speaker had blade type connector while the Kappa Pro has screw type connectors. I just folded the female blade connector in half with a pair of pliers and it fit intot the screw connector. Works great."
5,Eminence Kappa Pro 15A 500W PA Replacement Speaker 15 Inches,"I received the speaker in a couple of days. Much sooner than promised. It was packaged very well and received without any damage. I installed the speaker right away and used it that night at a job. Great value, price and above all it was received quickly and undamaged. Thank You!!"
1,I returned this book,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old when she was becoming a big sister. I loved the illustrations in this book and I liked the African cultural themes. I wish the rest was as good. The child in this book worries that his dad is not his dad anymore after a new baby is born. The way the dad reassures the child is by pointing out that their hands look alike and the child's eyes look like mamas. My child has not expressed worries about whether we are still her parents and I don't want to bring up such a disturbing thought for her if it is not on her mind already. Also, as I look around me I see many families where parents and children have differently colored, textured, or shaped eyes, skin, or hair. I don't want to buy books that teach my child that having identical physical features is necessary to be a family."
2,Seams opened up in first wash,"Very disappointed. Seemed easy to use. Used it to apply polish to car- worked well.But in first wash, seams opened up.Returning to Amazon seems straightforward."
3,O.K.,"Works fine if you are careful, one already has a tear in the seam after the first use.... I will use these but will go back to the foamie ones with my next purchase."
4,"Works, hard to keep a hold of","These need some sort of handle or part to hold onto. Dropping while waxing is bad, and these are hard not to drop."
3,"""Wash and dry as with any towel""? Not so much...","This applicator was ideal for both polish and wax applications. And indeed the fabric itself was easy enough to clean -- I did a little hand soak right after use, which got most of the oils off. The washing machine got the rest off.That said, I would note that this applicator did not make it through our front-load washer unscathed. After the spin cycle, the seams holding the foam inside the cloth split. In retrospect, I might have washed by hand and gotten fine results, but the durability of these applicators don't live up to Meguiar's ""Wash and dry as with any towel"" claim."
3,Work well but didn't do great in the wash.,"My boyfriend who is a mechanic likes these alot. My complaint is that among the 4 we used, the stitching on one came apart during washing. Next time I will put them in a mesh laundry bag in the washer to see if that helps."
5,Very Nice,These were much thicker than your average applicator which makes them nice. I was worried about them because they're white but they cleaned up really nice in the washing machine. I will buy more of these to replace my thinner applicators.
5,Works great.,Big improvement over using an old rag. The sponge in the center reduces the amount if dipping into the product
5,great product,"I got this product to go with the wax on helping apply, Yes I would buy this again, it does wash well."
5,what can one say??,"Meguiar's makes good stuff.not here to debate them vs some other makes.it works well enough to be classified as 5 star.of course, the entire Amazon transaction was exactly as expected.highly recommended..."
4,Percy Saves the Day DVD,"I bought this DVD for my 2 years old grandson, he just loves anything Thomas the Train, he almost has every word memorized, and this DVD does teach children about bad choices and making mistakes. I highly recommend it for all small children."
4,One of the greatest,"When I first played the origanal descent I loved it. I would play for hours, just staring at the screen. When I my friend said he had descent 3 I just had to try it out. I must say it is a great game. The graphics were slightly better than descentI. I also liked the robot allie who follows you around and helps you. The levels were however, much harder than those of descentI. also, the robots seem a lot smaller than they really are. When they should be 4 feet long, they look like 1 ft. But it is still a great game, One of the greatest sci fis i have ever played. If you are thinking buying this game, trust me, it will be worth it."
4,Excellent for fans; good for newbies.,"D3 is a worthy successor to the first two in the series and certainly takes it to the next level. If you enjoyed the originals, you'll certainly enjoy D3. Newbies are in for a bit of a learning curve, but it's worth trying out"
4,Happy Chef,"THIS IS A REALLY STURDY BASKET AND IT FITS THE MEDLINE 2 BUTTON WALKER JUST PERFECT.THE RATING OF 4* IS BECAUSE IT IS TOP HEAVY~~WE HAD TO ADD ADDITIONAL BACK WEIGHT TO IT...SO...IF YOU TAKE THE BACK LEGS OFF BY TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN AND PUT A SMALL LIGHT WEIGHT IN EACH LEG~~NO PROBLEM AFTER THAT~~IT TOOK A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT AND IT WAS SO EASY TO DO!NOW THERE IS NO PROBLEM OF TOPPLING OVER.WE HOPE THAT THIS'LL HELP FELLOW HANDICAPPED PERSONS THAT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, IT WORKED FOR US."
2,Basket for Walker,This basket would be great if it weren't so heavy. I put a couple of items in it and it made the walker top heavy and on one occasion the walker tipped over spilling everything on the floor. I do not use it unless I put in very light items and then I make sure I'm extremely careful while walking.
3,not as described,"product description was incorrect. amazon indicated the basket came with a plastic tray. it does not according to Medline, the company that manufactures and distributes this product. they indicated that they have never made a tray for this basket and that I needed to take my problem up with amazon. don't want to return it, my wife really needs the basket for her walker. I'll make something out of cardboard."
3,very big,This is a little too big for a normal size walker. It get's in the way.....It is well made.......but larger than any I have seen. If you are looking for an oversized one......it does install easily.
4,Did not come with a tray,"The basket is sturdy and was easy to install. However, it did not come with the clear, plastic tray that is listed in the description. That was disappointing."
4,Nice stable walker basket,"This basket is more stable on my husband's walker than the original one he had because of the way it hooks to the second bar on the walker. So far, it's working very well and we haven't seen any problems with the walker toppling forward. I would have given it 5 stars if it came with a plastic tray like the description says it does. The plastic tray from the old basket is too small for this larger basket."
3,walker basket,It is a good sturdy basket but it has no plastic tray and it falls off too easy. The last one I bought with the tray in it and different attaching system was far better.
4,Was not a perfect fit,Was not a perfect fit but we made mechanical adjustments to hook it onto the walker and it gets the job done...
1,Too heavy/need a second bar on walker to work,I couldn't use the basket because it was too heavy. Also your walker needs to have a second bar that goes width of the walker to be able to use it.
4,Almost perfect addition for my walker,"This basket fits perfectly and carries a lot, and also allows me to close the walker with the basket attached. If I was going to nitpick, I'd say it's a bit too large. It kind of gets in the way in tight spaces, but not enough to make me take it off! As for the criticism mentioned by some reviewers that it overbalances at times -- this is really a matter of common sense. It's a basket, not an anti-gravity device. Don't load it up with heavy stuff and it will balance just fine."
4,not for large walkers,"My husband has an extra large walker, and the bottom support openings were too narrow. It would help if the description included the diameter of the openings. I was able to use vice grips to widen the opening to the extent that it is usable, but it falls off if bumped. This would be ideal for a regular size walker, as it is very sturdy and good quality."
2,A WOMAN'S GUIDE TO SAN FRANCISCO,"I HAVE USED FROMMER'S GUIDES FOR YEARS. THIS ONE IS A POORCHOICE FOR THE GENERAL TRAVELER OR A PERSON WHO HAS VISITED SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE. IT ATTEMPTS TO BE TOO MUCH OF A ROUGH GUIDE TYPE GUIDE BOOK. TOO MUCH SPACE IS SPENT ON ""CUTE"" RESTAURANTS or B & Bs. THE LIST OF VARIOUS TYPES OF RESTAURANTS IS TOO SLANTED AND NARROW. I FINALLY FOUND A COUPLE OF LISTINGS FOR INDIAN RESTAURANTS BUT NONE IN THE BROAD GENERAL LIST AS AN EXAMPLE. THE HOTEL LIST IS TOTALLY LACKING. WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS FOR PURCHASE. ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!"
5,Works fast,"I'm easily discouraged by the whole process of dieting, but this one seems to be working very well for me. Fast weight loss...which improves my attitude about whether this whole process is worthwhile.Simple, easy to follow. Not real complex and a lot of common sense. Menus are easy enough for an old bachelor like me to follow."
3,Be Inspired by your Garden,"Plants and gardens have long been a source of inspiration for embroiderers, and for a blackthumb like me, embroideries of plants is about the only way I can guarantee to have them always.In this book, Thomasina Beck has managed to combine the two, with pictures of embroideries set in, of, and inspired by gardens.The book is well set out, and takes you through all the steps necessary to design your own garden-inspired embroidery, right down to discussing different techniques to portray folage and flowers.The techniques used to portray the various pieces pictured are varied, and I guarantee that every embroiderer will find some way to use her favorite technique."
3,Canoe cover,I bought this to keep excess water out while not in use. The zipper seam leaks and must be changed before it can actually be considered water proof as it leaks and fills with water. It was not worth it to me to ship it back for a refund so I placed the zippered part folded under the bottom of the canoe until I get a week or so of dry weather and can have a velcroed flap sewn over the entire length of the zipper to keep it sealed and less prone to seepage and filling with water.
4,Kayak cover,I am satisfied with the price and the quality of my purchase. The cover is a little big but serves its purpose in protecting my Kayak. I think it was made more specifically for a canoe then a kayak.
1,You must be kidding,"Every now and then I am completely puzzled by the positive reviews a book receives. In this case, regardless of a decent plot, the writing weighs so heavily on the book that it creaks and groans in an excruciating manner. The dialogue reads as if written by a teenage exchange student. It's not simply stilted and incredible, but pretentious and insulting. If you like your books filled with heavy handed symbols (a painter who can only copy the works of masters), conversation that sounds nothing like conversation and a strained sense of pretension, then this one is for you. For those lured in by the intriguing plot, save yourself a few hours and turn elsewhere. Anywhere will do."
1,Grossly over-rated,"I picked up this book off the street in San Francisco - it was the best-looking of a pile that someone had put out on the sidewalk. I should have left it there.The plot is poor, the characters pathetic. It's all very derivative. Even the ""authentic-sounding"" ""Ochos Rios"" is lousy Spanish. ""Eight rivers"" is ""Ocho Rios"" (no S on ocho) in Spanish. In fact, there is an ""Ochos Rios"" in Jamaica. Maybe he should have set it in Jamaica - there is certainly no sign that the author visited Uruguay - it might as well be set in Iowa for all the real local detail we get."
4,great book,This is a great book. There is nothing all that new about the grad student with a busted thesis but this book is a lot of fun. It reminded me of people I knew from college but these characters were clearly their own men and women. Nothing is wasted with Cameron's style. And the situation is more interesting than our own everyday lives but that only serves to concentrate the action. This is very believable territory and yet remarkable. I remember most of the book having read it some five years ago and I've read plenty of novels since then.
4,No proper research about Uruguay,"First of all I would like to say that I am from Uruguay. I bought this novel not only because I read good reviews, but also because the story happens in my country. This is the first Peter Cameron's novel I read. Although I liked the story, the characters and the way it was written, I found it disappointing that he knows almost nothing about Uruguay. I admit that this novel could have happened in any country in the world, just being distant from the USA. I think the place is not very important for the development of the novel, but once he chose Uruguay I think he could have done a better research about the country and our customs. He wrote several wrong statements about the country, the landscape, the food we eat and our customs. Even I know that while writing a novel the author can made up everything, those statements where disappointing for me."
2,Not very tough,"Item was as advertised but didn't hold its air really well --had to continually blow extra air in --""skin"" not as sturdy as I would have liked"
2,Detail without substance.,"Rarely do I wish a protagonist to meet an untimely end. Unfortunately this is exactly what I felt after about page 80. She runs away from the plot and ventures off into pseudo-intellectual ranting for the remainder of the story. I wanted to start from the beginning as I explored Ms. Kraus' work. But after this first novel, I could stand no more."
5,Fanx,"This is a great book, Do buy it. I concur with the other reviewers especially the Aussie woman. Chris, thanks for the honourable mention. Hope that 'Aliens & Anorexia' is an even greater success"
3,Out of date and pricey,"I checked 6 books out of the Hawaii State Library system after our latest visit to the ""kidney doctor"" to try to figure out what to cook for my husband. This book contains many delicious recipes. Unfortunately there are not many that work for someone diabetic with Stage IV kidney disease. His restrictions are no red meat, no fish, no dairy, low postassium. There are a couple vegetable recipes I am going to try; most of the others in here would require a lot of revamping to be useful to us.Suggestion: Cooking for David has a lot of recipes that work without modification because they include a lot of vegetables--and the ones my beloved spouse can eat!"
3,Really hard to change bulbs,"The lamp looks nice, but one of the halogen bulbs was dead on arrival and needed to be replaced. To replace a bulb, you must remove a ""spring ring"" that is holding a protective glass cover over the bulb. This spring is very hard to remove, making lamp replacement a major headache."
2,"great product, excessive shipping cost","This is a great product, but the shipping cost from this vendoris way too high. You can do better elsewhere. Hope Amazoneventually fixes this ...."
3,Too Many Subplots,"This book was fair. Considering its source material, I was expecting more from it though. There are too many subplots and it takes a very long time before the author gets to the actual narrative regarding the prisoners' goal. A lot of things happen to the characters that have nothing to do with the prison camp"
3,A Good Basic Review,"For those without any Strategic Management background (or those who have been out of it for a while), this book provides a good foundation to build your knowledge upon. Although it lacks the substance on application to Government stategic planning (or at least as much as I wanted to read about), the information provided helps see and extrapolate potential applicability to non-for-profit organizations. In addition, the time when the book is written (1970's) does not allow the author to explore the latest computer applications on the area of planning and to comment and analyze the latest fast growing/short turnaround technology companies. In addition to reading this book, I recommend expanding your reading further with a more recent book that may address newer companies and government agencies."
2,Very Basic,"The book was a very introductory level guide to strategic planning that would be good for someone who has little knowledge of the process. The book was published in 1979 and shows its age in recommending a full year strategic planning cycle. Most views today suggest this process should be condensed to a short period, yet still be made effective and be integrated with the budgeting process. Overall, as an experienced manager, I was disappointed as it brought very little to light that I didn't already know."
1,Same 'Ol Troubles As Before...,"Okay, this is my third and last review on this product. The more I use Pinnacle Studio 9 Deluxe, the more I hate it! This program can't handle intermediate/advance video/audio editing at all and is becoming a complete waste of time and money. If you wanna transfer your old grandma home videos to DVD, this may be okay, but outside of that, don't even waste your time or money!"
1,Horrible program,"This may make wonderful videos but the problem is getting it installed so that it acutally works! If you just install it like any other program, it freezes up your computer. Then you write to support and they make you jump through hoops-uninstalling/installing, taking out your sound card, reinstalling the drivers for both your sound and video cards even though they work just fine. I got a list of 10 things to do just to make this program work. If you don't respond within 48 hours, you have to start the entire help process all over again and it takes at least that long or longer to do all the things they suggest if you have a normal life with other things to do. I have still not been able to make mine work so I am now looking for a new program. Any suggestions?squirleyan@comcast.net"
1,"No Audio, Poor Audio Sync","I returned this program after countless hours trying to copy VHS tapes to DVD.I burned 4 coasters with no audio, video was fine. I spent hours on the phone with tech support and was given a different fix each time to try. When I finally figured out that when bringing up the volume control menu and selecting Properties then ""Recording"" I was able to burn the DVD with sound however the sync with the lip movement was terrible. I again attempted to copy a musical I created, the lip sync was even worse.After purchasing a book by Jan Ozer and trying to figure out how to correct the Audio Sync, I still lost the battle and returned the product to Best Buy for refund.Anyone buying this program is asking for a lot of headaches."
1,will not burn to DVD,"This program worked fine until the last step: burning to DVD.This omission makes it completely worthless. Of course, I have no idea how to get Pinnacle to help me. Does anyone know how to get this to work?"
3,survived my first real winter with just this blanket,"I moved from warm sunny California to Philadelphia a year ago and got this as my winter blanket. With just the furnace on low I stayed very warm and snuggly every night. Color is not properly depicted in photo (which makes it look like a funky gray purple blue) it really is an average navy blue color. The downside to this blanket (which is not shown in the photo) is that it is only soft on one side, the other side feels like used stuffed animal fur and is a lighter shade of gray blue. Invest in something more expensive if you want both sides to be korean mink texture."
3,Donnie Yen makes this a watchable film,"Crystal Hunt was a fairly poor film, perhaps due to lack of budget, but it was none the less an average film that you wouldn't mind renting, which is what I did.Donnie Yen makes this film and his fights against regulars such as Micheal Woods( whom was the muscular fighter that fought against Donnie Yen on the top of the building at the end of 'In Line of Duty 4') makes this film fairly watchable and merely a collection filler rather than a centre piece of a film collection."
2,not so good,I didn't like this movie much...it has a predictable story to it and bad portrayed fightscenes.....a shame the talented Donnie Yen is in this one......Because his talent is not being showed.....and this movie makes him look bad
2,not so good,I didn't like this movie much...the story isn't very good and the fightscenes aren't portrayed very well....very dissapointing from an actor so talented as Donnie....
4,A good beginning guide for a new geologist,A nice guide if you plan on going out into the field and exploring the world around you. It inspired me to get out of the car and do more walking so I could see geology at work for myself. If you were just looking for a book to explain geological places and processes in California it probably would not suffice. I would compare it to a travel book about the hidden places in a certain area rather than a general guide.
2,All the cliches are here,"All the cliches are here. Rich people looking ""down"" on the not so rich. Doctors looking ""down"" on lowly lab techs. Spoiled rotten rich daddy's girl who got him to pay for her education up though and including supporting her as a resident physician, Annick acts patronizingly as she is only looking out for you aka Bill O'Rielly.Annick has no worries or debts so she can afford to be magnanimous. She even flies to France on the weekends via daddy's private jet when she wants to get away from it all and once in while invites a ""poor"" physician in training along and then she and daddy secretly smirk at him as he takes in the personal jets and opulent hotels and apartments.The reader gets the feeling Annick even feels smarter than the administrative staff of the hospital because her father could buy it.If the author had Grady kill Annick instead of those children, I would have given this book a 5."
5,A +,"I thought this book was well written and very suspenseful. The author seemed well educated on the topic of biological weapons and the ending definently catches the reader off guard. All in all, great suspense. I haven't read Birken's other novel but I will now."
5,Plague- An excellent book on today's reality,"Must of us do not have an idea of what those with an evil mind are planing to do, this book carries us in a world unknown for the majority of us, exploring areas that in today's reality there is a need to know, in order to prevent it.Excellent."
1,"Plague: A Novel Of Bioterrorism by Gary Birken, Md","One word: ""...Crestfallen crestfallen creatfallen""Know I ask you, how many times do you expect to hear, use or read this word in a life time? Expect to see it - 3 times in this Crestfallen of all books. Avoid this effort...Scott Turlow of the medical profession - NOT!Reread Hot Zone. I wanted Simione Grady to put the 'ricin' back in the sugarbowl."
5,nana x three little girls,We bought this because lighting had taken out ours. It has worked just great and restored our computer to the level it was before. No problems at all with the item. Great shipment from the seller.
5,GI Detox,"I have found that this is a much more healthy way to get the fiber needed daily to maintain regularity. It has a very fresh and natural scent to it, and there are no additives, sweeteners or fillers added. Plus, it has probiotics in it that your intestinal tract can always benefit from. I just mix it with orange juice and drink it right before bedtime. Yes, it has an herbal taste to it, but not hard to get down at all. I would highly recommend this as an alternative to Metamucil, which is not an all-natural product."
3,A delight for young cowboys and lovers of fathers.,"A young cowboy describes the sights, sounds, and smells of a workday on the ranch. Apple's illustrations reflect the love and admiration between a father and a son with which Gardella amply fills the text. This book will especially delight children who treasure both a love of cowboys and a love for their fathers."
4,"Nice fit for the RAZR, but the swivel belt clip is huge","This is a very nice fitting case. It works better for women though who store their phones in their purse and have no need for the belt clip. For men, you're better off leaving the clip off and just storing the phone in your pocket. A non-swivel type clip might have been better for this. It really is huge and a little clumsy. The leather case itself is really nice, a great fit. It looks as good as it does on the photo. If you can do without that belt clip it's even nicer."
1,Junk,"I've had several cases, Krusell, Vaja and Sena but this has to be the worst of the bunch. Krusell has never nor will ever be in the Vaja and the Sena class but they've usually for the money been descent. The charging port was halfway covered by the leather! I tried to pull it up further so it would line up to the hole and the leather that's sewn to the plastic bottom ripped. GAME OVER! The clip that comes with it will not swivel either. Totally useless, waste of money. Live and learn."
5,Nice Case,"The case fits the phone perfectly. To all those complaining about the swivel clip, these cases use a system called multidapt which allows you to use a variety of different clips and mounts.See here:http://www.krusell.se/subCategories.php?grupp=6Consider the miniclip for a thinner profile."
1,Dont waste your money,I don't understand why so many people like this case. The main point of Moto Razr is that it is well ... thin. And this case makes it look really ugly. Especially when you use it with a belt clip it is bundled with. Don't waste you money!!!
3,A good qulity case with wrong clip.,"A good qulity case. Quality leather. Case was supposed to come with rotating clip, but came with spring clip. This was very disturbing. Since vendor was 3rd party, Amazon wouldn't switch clips. 3rd party vendor did credit for clip."
5,A case can't be better than this,"Krusell is a well known manufacturer for quality and perfect fit. This is no exception. I own a Krusell brand case for my Dell Axim and recently purchased this one for my Razr.Craftsmanship is excellent, stitches are very well aligned as well as opening for USB connection. It fits perfectly on my Razr. I looked at all available Razr cases before I bought this and realized I made a good decision."
1,fairly useless item,"I don't see what others have liked about this. It doesn't add any value -- doesn't make the phone easier to carry or use, doesn't add significant protection, or do anything else. I'd recommend getting a pouch with a slide-on clip, that holds the phone horizontally on your belt or waistband."
5,Slim close fitting case perfect for Razr,Perfect slim close fitting case and is well worth the money. The razr remains very thin since this case is wellcrafted. No bulk here and extremely stylish. Krusell makes the best cell phone cases in the world.
5,perfect case,"this case is perfect, It does not make the phone thick at all - otoh it makes the phone easy to hold. I was always afraid of it slipping off my hands otherwise. The clip is secure and swivels well.The craftsmanship and design are excellent, as expected from a scandinavian designed product. Not sure where exactly it was made, but quality is really high, does not look at all like a throwaway far eastern piece.I am very happy with this piece. I am planning to keep the phone for a couple of years, it should last that much tool hopefully.Only thing that they could have done differently is provide a cover for the LCD screen as wekk, but no biggie - i can put an old palmpilot screenprotector on that too. maybe it was to keep the phone close as flat as possible. Oh the elastic backpanel design is neat, keeps the cover on when the phone is open.overall, a very solid accessory, kind of hard to see these days, so full of cheap trash which floods the market so much."
4,best case so far,this really is the best razr case I have found so far the only things that could make it better are: rotating clip! and they really need to think of some way to keep dust from collecting in the plastic windows around the screen.
2,Alright,"I wanted a case that fit snug with a small clip. Unfortunately, the attachment for the clip kind of protrudes. Add this to the clip that is also thick and it sticks out on your waist. Kind of defeats the slim Razr. I bought a clip that was thinner but it easily slips off.The other bad thing is that it doesn't totally protect the Razr. As you can see from the photos it leaves the top sides exposed (near camera lens). So if you drop it then you can expect the Razr to get chipped.So I've had it over a year and it is alright but could be improved."
2,Belt clip is 2-plastic sided clip not as showing in figure!!!,"Hi, i bought this case 3-months ago and it was fine, later on the belt clip because its plastic the 2-sides got ripped and scratched so the case keeps falling from the clip which is annouying in some time the phone falls when it gets pressed by your side or belt.The picture shows the belt clip hooks to a round plastic thing, THIS IS NOT RIGHT! the clip you will be recieving is a 2-sided plastic edges that slide in the case, if one gets pealed then it will loose and fall.I kept on using the case holding it in my hand because the case is very helpful in openning/closing by flipping the phone and i needed that.Thanks,TOA"
4,Not Too Bad,"I just received my Krusell Case and I'm fairly pleased. Unlike reviewer ""Blakdogg's"" swivel clip(see image), mine came with a much smaller clip making it much thinner (purchased from JRs). It also doesn't rotate around.Just wished they had put a protected plastic piece for the inside screen. I would have given it 5 stars instead.Other than that, this is a good case and fits well."
4,highly enlightening,"After i read Master, I checked this out from the library at my college. Reading it was almost as fun as reading the book of the subject. Absolutely replete with valuable insights. Also, it never tells you what to think but just highlights the many complex questions and enigmas in this complex book."
3,Decent model kit for beginners,"As a fine scale modeller, I've learned that Revell kits tend to be more geared toward beginners. That opinion holds true for this particular kit as well: it's generally inferior to the Tamiya (1/350 and 1/700 scales) and Hasegawa (1/450 scale) kits, and has many flaws: inaccurate decals, insufficient painting instructions, and poorly proportioned parts (many are far too thick, even given the limits of styrene casting, and my deck was warped significantly). The 1/535 scale is absurdly eccentric: there literally aren't any other kits in this scale, much less aftermarket parts (like photoetched railings). That said, it's cheap as heck, and simple to build, making it perfect for a beginner. The historical value of this ship was done imo insufficient service; I'd expect a kit to have more than a single page factsheet that focuses only on the Japanese surrender. Beginners, keep in mind: paint and glue are not included."
1,Poor model of a great ship,"I don't normaly build battelship as I love building tallships sailing ships of the line. They seem to be more detaled, but I got this mainly because of the price and It is just what you pay for. Very poor model and very little detail. Could not recomand this model to anyone over ten years. It is a shame this ship desirves to have a better model than this one, but you get what you pay for. Best services did a great job getting the model to me and they can't be held responsible for the model. So I killed a few days doing this that is about all I can say for it. Get a larger scale and spend a little more don't wast your money on this one."
1,"Seriously, the instrustions are very poor","If you buy this product, it will tell you where to paint. but they wont color it for you.When i bought this, I thought they already colored the instrustion booklet so I can get an idea where to correctly paint. Sadly, this is a piece of Junk and if you buy this you would have to waste your time online painting the battleship the correct colors that the real battleship would be."
2,Revel 1:535 Uss Missouri Battleship,"Nowhere in the ad did it say this was a 'KIT'. It shows the model ship and that's what I expected shipped to my brother. Instead it is a package of many, many small parts which he is unable to put together. So, no, I am not please with this product and neither is he. He wanted a model, as pictured, because he was in the So. Pacific and saw the Missouri up close. He was greatly disappointed as am I, I feel I was mislead by your ad.Thelma Temple"
1,para nada,"esto no es una replica, es peor que un juguete barato. hace unos seis meses que lo compre y ni siquiera me he animado a ensamblarlo debido a la mala calidad."
1,useless book,"this book is totally disappointment, not much better than man pages: just show the functions' signatures, not much in depth useful information. don't buy!"
2,Not an especially good reference or tutorial,"It's been several years since my original review of this book. The short version of my review is that this book is poorly written and hard to use. None of the several engineers who have borrowed this book from me have liked it.Get a copy of ""The C++ Standard Library"" by Josuttis instead. It is a tremendously better reference and tutorial on STL, and an infinitely more readable book."
2,"disorganized, lack of sample code, not much there","I was hoping this book could shed some light on this subject, and I was wrong. If you look for some concrete examples then this book isn't it."
3,"dated, not detailed enough","Somewhat dated reference to STL, with general overview of STL concepts. The style is simple, general, and tutorial. I wanted a book at a higher level, and I was disappointed. While this book might help you use STL containers in straightforward circumstances, it doesn't contain enough theory to give you mastery of the topic."
1,Useless,You will be better of by reading manual from SGI website. It waist of money and time trying to buy and read this book.
3,"Good, but poorly organized","I am afraid that among all this 5-star stimations I would look stupid, but my major criteria for the book is whether you feel the stuff after reading. No, I am not. You will not find ""pseudo real-world"" examples, but the same a-la ""hello world"" is repeated again and again. Yet another book about STL. Not the worst one, but definitely far from being perfect. I do not really understand what is the big deal to explain STL - this is not rocket science!"
5,Compelling!,"I really wanted to get a better 'feel'of what my father, Herb Fish, went through during WWII. He was a Tank Gunner in Co. ""B"", ""Tiger Division"" from 1942-46 in the ETO, 3rd and 10th AD. It is hard to put such terror in words and describe them. You have to be there to really know. This book is an excellent overview, but nothing describes what our men in battle really went through. Thanks to all the men in battle who gave us all!! I applaud and Honor all of you."
5,This book changed my live,"yes, this book had changed my live, the way I think, live, act, etc. MUST HAVE AND MUST READ BOOK!! very good inspiration for everyone."
5,Synopsis,"A SECRET CHILD.... When Lucy Rushton's lover was killed in battle, she wed his brother, formidable viscount Drake Strickland, to protect her unborn child. the marriage tore her heart, yet after their vows were sealed, Lucy saw another side to her stern husband--a compassionate, captivating gentleman of substance who lured her in ways Jeremy never had! A SECRET LOVE....Duty bound to care for lovely Lucy, Drake never expected sharing his home would warm his cold, bare life. And when her eyes flashed with provacative beauty, sending an irresistable invitation, he longed to believe his wife's heart was wholly his."
1,That's what this book is about,"You know, that's what this book is about. It is jeolousy, it's deceitfulness, vindictiveness. You know, it's all those things. But I mean, God, what can Deborah Hale excpect when she is on top. It's like Napolean, you know, when he was king, and people were trying to constantly conquer him, you know, in the Roman Empire."
1,Drivers side gasket was short and thus leaked when installed,It was too short on the end that was near the firewall. When i placed it in the valvecover it would retract out. I kept having to stretch it and place it back in. I installed it anyway because my oem was trash. Leaked oil onto my header/turbo and smoke ensued. Not even going to bother with the passenger side.Purchased a Beck/Arnley and it fit perfectly.
4,Neon green eyes alien pewter pendant,"Item came safely, thanks. Cute pendant, I'll wear it for fun outings with casual wear. Well made, would have liked it a bit larger, as I'm into big pendants. Always like the pendants I buy from Dans Jewelers."
4,"The best available work on Biblical Numerology, IMO","John Davis explores the often mysterious realm of biblical numerology without ""straining at gnats [and/or] swallowing camels,"" so to speak. There are many other works available (E. W. Bullinger's ""Number in Scripture,"" Johnston's ""Numbers in the Bible,"" etc.) which are far too unreliable and utilize biblical numerology to explain or teach one's own dogmas. John Davis, however, approaches biblical numerology from a very open, birds-eye-view standpoint, and gives clear, concise examples of usage, history, and even the future of numerological interpretation for the bible student. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever had interest in biblical numerology.The book itself is small and at a good price; worth every penny."
2,Too small!!,"I had to return this set because the handles were too small for comfort. I am an average size person, I think only someone with petite hands would be comfortable using this set and even then the handles are rather fat and short...there are better sets to select from...I would recommend passing on these!"
2,Doesn't cut it,"I purchased this set back in January 2004, it's now March 2004. Initally, I was disappointed in the wooden tray - due to it's total lack of function. After using the cutlery set for about 1 month, the knifes all started to pull out of the handles. I would not recommend this item."
1,CHEAP!! This set will disappoint you.,Don't be fooled by the price. I thought I was getting a great deal. This service hasn't been through the dishwasher 5 times and already blades and tongs are falling out of the handles. I've had to throw 4 pieces away already. The handles are awful. Go with something that's all in one piece. I should have.
2,Oneida Pilot Slate Blue Set is not worth the money,"I bought this set about 6 months ago...in fact, I bought two sets. While the price was very attractive, I certainly hoped for better quality. Several of the handles have come off. Sure, I epoxied them back on, but the overall fit and finish are also very SUBSTANDARD. For a few dollars more, you can do much better. The best part about the set is the nicely made wooden drawer tray. Given a choice, I would have much rather had better quality in the flatware!!!"
2,Cute but Sheds,"The look of this stuffed sloth is very cute and realistic but the toy sheds like none other. Just brushing your hand over its ""fur"" will cause many many fibers to come off. May be good for putting on display on a shelf, but definitely not good for a child's toy."
5,This sloth is amazing,"Our family hides this all over the house, it's super fun and creepily life like. Love it buy it nao"
5,A surprizing find,My mom loves sloths and I bought this for her. She hung it on a tall plant where it looks cute.
5,good quality,Parts are of the highest quality. Installation was moderately difficult due to unrelated pictures. Very important to mock up your particular system before cutting any hoses or making any holes in your case. Performance is solid: 30C idle and 45C Max load. I am running QX9650 @ 4ghz. Also cooling NB and sb chips w/bitspower.
1,Will not work on a kindle without $15 a month!,"This book is a favorite of all three of my boys. We are traveling and looking through the kindle store it was available. Too bad for us, we are unable to read or listen to a book we found using the kindle, because I am not a member of yet another $15 a month waste of money. If this is ONLY for listening, it should not come as a choice to one-click purchase on my kindle. I was given an option to join a club or buy separately... why give the option if there really isn't a choice. I am disappointed Amazon. Kindle books should be available to be read on the kindle."
5,Great Great Book,I LOOOOVE This Book It is great and you even get to learn a little at the end:] My sister really loves these books and so do I.
4,This is a very good book.,"This is an excellent magic book. The instructions are good, and the photos help a lot. I can gladly recommend this book. But, one of the most helpful things about it, is that it gives the aspiring magician tips on how to keep the audience's intrest. With great tricks for friends and living rooms, this can be very useful advice. In conculsion, this is a very good use of your money."
4,An excellent book for beginners,"Although somewhat expensive for the number of effects it contains, the book is worthwhile since the effects chosen are excellent, and there is a good variety of effects. There is also a value to having numerous color photographs. Overall, I am happy that I purchased this book and can recommend it."
5,Excellent book,"I ordered this book on Amazon at the recommendation of a friend. I was very glad I did. I loved the Story, writing and the characters. The author put a very unique twist on the story of Dracula. The book represents a honest portrait of the brutality of the time period. The story manages to be VERY sexy without being corny. This is an excellent book for fans of Laurell k. Hamilton or Anne Rice not for the Twilight crowd."
1,Wow really?,"I thought I was purchasing white 6 x 9"" envelopes but to my surprise I received BLACK 4 1/8 x 9 1/2"" inch envelopes. I called but could not get transfered to the correct person, i left countless messages but no one retured my call so I could return the envelopes. I am very unhappy with their customer service. Dont purchase anythign you might not get what you thought you ordered."
4,ONE BUCKET,"I have to admit when I purchased this bucket, I thought I was getting three (as shown in the picture). Much to my disappointment you do only get ONE bucket. With that being said, a bucket's a bucket. The kids had fun playing with this and their other beach toys."
3,Product Vs. Service,"although the software industry has significantly evolved and this book is from far far away (2004), I decided to read it primely because of excellent reviews on the web. This book is for entrepreneurs and managers and despite the history lessons given by Cusumano he does an excellent job explaining, in details, the shift to SAAS (Software as a service).SaaS is an excellent business strategy that every software company should adopt. If you intend to provide a 'service' read this book and put emphasis on chapter 6: start-up case studies: software products, services and hybrid solutions.It surely helped me.Dror Guzman"
5,Un buon prodotto,"Bello a vedersi e funzionale. Per l'utilizzo che mi sono proposto è un ottimo prodotto.Funzionale, comodo e bello. Per il momento non mi vengono in mente lati negativi."
5,Midland 75-822,I used this devise for one day now and i am impressed.My expectation was very low before i bought it but i was surprised when Midland 75-822 was picking up conversations on 4 different channels from my house with original small antenna.I owned Radio-shack CB radio before and performance was not even close to Midland 75-822.Can not wait to try it with larger antenna outside of my house and also in my car with Wilson CB antenna.Thanks
1,"range too short,","be honest . if you buy this (CB transceiver radio) you're going to need a miracle to make if work. i tested with my girl friend.as soon as i walk away 50 meter from her, i couldn't heard anything and get any signali'm not sure how can people give 5 star review to this product.maybe they all use the external antenna to get better signal.sorry to say that not what i want. i use to have a motorola walkie talkie. work better that this like 100X time.sorry midland CO. i'm not try to destroy your reputation. quality is what we want."
5,this is the product to have for short trips,very easy to use and has a long range for communicaton. this is what you would want if you do not want to carry too much stuff.
1,"Poor Quality, Receiver Fails After Six Weeks","I ordered the 75-822 in May of 2006. The receiver went ""deaf"" in August and I returned it to Midland for warranty repair. They sent me a replacment in September, and by November the receiver had failed in the new one. The radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down. When the radio would receive signals, the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said. The transmitter in both units still worked. Don't waste your money."
4,Small and easy to use,CB is an enjoyable alternative to Mobile CB's where room in your car is at a premium. The mobile adapter combined with an external ant makes this radio a must for the car. Range is the same as with the bigger units. The flexable ant gives you a very short range.
1,Not worth the money,Was not worth the money range is very limited and very unclear to understand other party talking
2,Do not use this in case of an emergency!,"Most disappointing. Works, but does not work well. Coverage is minimal and frequencies are hardly used any more by anyone. I bought this for a specific use so it's OK for me, but don't use it on the basis of "" safety "". Use your cellular instead."
1,Not A Very Good CB,"The discription sounded good but after I bought it and put it to use, I found it to be ""not as advertised"" and returned it."
3,couldnt get it dialed in while mounted.,"I had this cb for a short time and could never get it to work correctly, except for in the handheld mode. I never got a chance to look more into it because someone stole it. I ended up with a uniden 520xl pro IIRC, and it works great."
4,"Very nice radio, if only it were waterproof...","This is the second radio of this model that I've owned, both adapted to and mounted on a motorcycle for Bike-to-Bike communication. When matched to a quality antenna, the range is better than I expected, perhaps as much as several miles. This is quite adequate for my needs. The ability to adapt the unit to the motorcycle's intercom system was a critical factor in my selection and this radio is easily adapted using the headset ports. The first radio got soaked in a rainstorm and quit working until I opened it up and dried it out, then all was well again and the radio still works fine. I just have to put a bag over it for protection from the weather I guess. The second radio is mounted on my new bike and I expect similar performance. I like the ability to convert it to a handheld as well but haven't had the opportunity to really use that feature much."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE,"After reviewing the opinions on this unit a friend of mine and myself decided to make the purchase anyway. There were 5 star and 1 star reviews. After several days of testing the two new units on our motorcycles and while on a 2,000 mile road trip we simply put the units in our saddle bags and never turned them on again. Both transmission and reception distances are shameful. Even when using No ground plane antennas. Straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about 300 feet. We also got the same results when transmitting and receiving from a motorcyle that had a built in CB. His Trans and Rec was great but ours was terrible. The unit is fantastic for receiving weather info but it should not be listed to communicate for 2 miles. 2' is more like it."
4,Handy radio.....,Purchased this radio as a hold over until I mounted my other radio in the truck. Worked fine. Speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows down.
2,very compact but was a waste of money,"I purchased this because of how compact it was however I barely got a 50 foot range with it. I asked the local CB repair shop if there was anything I could do to fix the range on it, they said get a real CB, the compact all in one handset units are not worth it."
2,Hoped for better,I purchased this unit for a road trip cross-country. I was very disappointed with the quality. If I could return it at this point I would. Range is less than 1000 feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle. I've had other handhelds in the past with much better reception.
3,Good for the price,Radio worked great for first couple of trips and then the car adaptor stopped working suddenly. Handheld still works but the car adaptor was a much better setup for me. Planning on buying a Uniden in car unit now and keep the handheld as a back up. Get what you pay for I guess. Will contact midland to see about a replacement for the car adaptor.
3,"Good performer, but akward buttons","I bought this unit to use in an antique car because didn't want to drill holes to mount a traditional CB. The car is 6 volt, so rather than use a voltage convertor, I bought a 12 volt compact rechargable battery pack and an exterior antenna, and together they work great. This unit is handy and performs it's function well, but the mic key is small and the channel up/down keys are directly above the mic key. Consequently, I frequently hit the channel key when trying to hold down the mic. Also inconvenient is the belt hanger - not the regular circular knob for a standard hanger that you find on a standard CB mic, which necessitated a homemade hanger! I got too frustrated with they key issue and broke down and bought a regular compact Midland instead."
2,OK if you want a toy,"Opened the box and was impressed with the appearance. Started to review each piece. The battery packs are a bit flimsy. Put the fresh AA batteries in one pack and 8 rechargables in the other and went outside to try it. Only heard static on the CB bands. Tried the weather bands and heard WX 1 loud and clear. Hooked up the radio in my car and connected the outside antenna, same result on CB bands. Tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results. Checked antenna with another CB and it worked.It appears that the Midland is a very attractive toy but not really a usable CB.Glad I bought it from Amazon so there is no problem returning."
2,"static, missing part","Overall this product was ok. There was alot of static and I had to turn the Squelch up so much I missed conversation. Also, the rechargeable battery pack had a piece missing. The controls on the reciever were ok, they could have been backlit for night time driving. And the lcd screen should have the option to stay lit all of the time."
2,Ineffective,"I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product. Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna. Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck. Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked. It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments."
2,"compact cb radio, needs better reception","Very poor reception with the factory antenna, I tried it with another antenna mount to the roof, it was a little bit better. I like it because it's compact and out of the way, good quality radio."
1,Bad experience with this one,"I purchased this touse between automobiles on the raod...Mostly to listen to the cross talk whn traffic backs up... the compact DC no battery attachment seemed like a good idea... However the unit definitely required an external attenna to function... it was totally worthless with the short one...even in battery mode.I was not satisfied with this unit because it did not function with the short antenna and returned it.One more consideration that I found uncomforable... this unit comes with two different battery packs, a standard AA and a rechargable AA. I do not know why you need 2 more rechargeables than regulars but thats not the point... why do I want to have to keep track of more parts? design it better."
2,Poor performance from Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB-Way Radio,"While unit did work occasionally, 98% of the time all I heard was static - breaking squelch and unintelligble audio.Radio is not worth owning."
1,Defective from the box,Purchased this cb from Best Buy. It would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle. Most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once I made a call to the company I figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb. After going through that it didn't work. I am sending it back and will not be reordering.
2,NOT SO HAPPY,"RECEIVED PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER,NOT HAPPY WITH RECEPTION,EVEN INSTALLED OUTER ANT.WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.MEANING PRODUCT NOT AMAZON.LOTS OF GREAT STUFF ON AMAZON AT REASONABLE AND FAIRPRICES.BUT WOULD NOT BUY HANDHELD RADIO AGAIN"
4,You get what you pay for.,"For $80+ dollars this radio is outstanding.It does not compare to the $500 ham HT I also own, but then it wouldbe foolish to expect it to."
2,MIDLAND 75-822 40 Channel 2 Way Radio,"Not what I was hoping for. Hooked it up to a whip antenna and took it on a trip to Tennessee following some friends. I know that tuning the antenna helps, but we had it working for about 3 city blocks with that antenna before we left and 0 blocks with the antenna that came on the CB. By the time I got out of town, I could haedly pick up my friends from 100 ft. Really disappointed in this as a Midland product. Would not recommend it to anyone serious about having good communications."
5,C.W. McCall approved,"A few years back my buddy Spider Mike got roughed up by some Bears. Well, we weren't goin' to have none of that. So, Rubber Duck, Pig Pen and Me we went out and got us some of these and started ourselves a convoy. When we tore up our swindle sheets and left them sitting on the scales they called in the Illinois National Guard. These things really helped out especially when they put a Bear in the air."
1,Do Not Buy,I got three 75-822 for the sake of communication for 3-4 miles. I got them just in few days due to my Prime account but hugely disappointed. These CB radio with stock antenna would not have more than 50 yards. Yes 50 YARDS. It is a piece of junk. I have not try with car antenna but that is not the purpose of use. I want some mobility and these were like toys. I would stay away from them.......
2,Midland 75-822 CB,"Works well if you can see the person or truck your talking with. The car adapter makes a lound screaching sound that the person you are talking to only can here, so it sucks! In my opinion I would try the Cobra before this one"
2,Depends on what you want it for,"I got this when I was driving a truck across country, but I was working for a jump-seat operation and was never in the same truck twice. I was looking for one I could easily take with me to the next truck, but this thing is simply underpowered. I still have not been able to get it to talk out more than a truck length, and the whole reason I needed it was for communicating with the dispatch office at warehouses to know when to get my paperwork.I will give it this much though, when it does work it sounds very clear, and it is extremely mobile. It's just not very long range."
1,Such High Hopes,"Even though the review's were just ok. I decided to order two of these for Christmas Gifts. Thinking they would be great when traveling rurally and out of Cell Phone Range! The first time we turned one on and off again...It quit working...Sent it back, the replacement was delivered promptly!!Unfortunately...They never worked unless in the same room...Tried them on the interstate and couldn't even get a trucker...The weather station does work however.I returned both units and was refuned in 2 days."
4,Neat Portable CB!,"This handheld CB is quite nice and certainly performs as advertised. The unit comes with everything needed to use with either batteries (easily replaceable batteries) or plug in to your vehicle. Within the proper range (which with the included antennae is probably about 1 mile) volume and clarity of communications are outstanding.The only reason that it only got 4 stars is to make sure those getting it realize it is not the same as a ""non-handheld"" CB radio. It is a great portable or back up unit, but it simply shouldn't be expected to have the range of a ""mounted"" CB. Some vehicles may also not some low grade engine noise feedback through the unit. This may go away when ""plugged in"". Also note that with a quick connection to a taller / external antennae, range also will improve.All in all, exactly what I paid for and am pleased with the purchase!"
5,Midland 75-822 40 chanel CB Radio,HeyGot this from Amazon great portable radio works in the car works mobil as well great sounds great weather great for travel information you can use it with or without the car antena same results its a great CB package all in one unit everythings right in your hand while you are driving makes it easy to talk on the road or take it with you when you leave the car thanks again great products
4,Midland 75-933 40 Ch 2 way CB,"Product is solid. The plug-in/portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil Wil.Reception is not great, a couple miles, but typical unless you plug into an antenna, again typical. full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature.Nothing amazing about it, nothing bad about it. Great back up when cell service is not available."
4,Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB-Way Radio,"Lots of accessories and parts...make sure you buy one in a box complete, not used.Limited use anymore, since most people use their cells, but has it's place on the long highway stretches of the U.S. still. Good backup communication."
4,CitadelBlue,This SMALL CB radio is great. I use it in the car hooked to my headrest with the Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX.
2,Thought it would be a great back up,"I was going to use it for in the car for the occasional time it would be good to talk and see what is going on. Fits in glove box easily, cables make it easy to power up. Reception is horrible with the antenna included. It can barley talk to others that are with in 15ft of stopped traffic.Do not have an external antenna so can not say how much that would help. But at that point I would just install a full size unit."
1,Range VERY limited; returned item,Range with included antenna was 100 yards with a known good setup on the other end. I have had walkie-talkies that perform better. There are better choices available.
5,Perfect for use on motorcycle,"Our motorcycle riding group uses some of these handheld CB units to communicate while on a ride. They work great! Not a lot of range, but enough so we can keep in touch while on the road in a group. We found that the MotoComm MC-751 headsets work well with this CB."
4,Midland's great!,"The radio is great. standard reception with the rubber ducky antenna is poor, but it's completely portable so don't expect great range with a small antenna. With the supplied pwr/ant adapter the signal is great with a 102"" whip; however, the Wilson 4ft silver load antenna did not work well at all with my Jeep Cherokee mounted on the bumper. The radio is great; a scan feature that works, the squelch works, volume's not great when traveling at speed with the windows down, Extra battery cases, everything works as it should. If you hold down the function button you can see the freq instead of the channels. Overall this is an excellent hand-held radio."
5,A neat little package,"I was pleasantly surprised with the compact size of this radio. It is a versatile little item: full-power 40 channels of CB, 10 NOAA channels (not available with all CB brands, but Midland seemed to recognize the importance of this feature), and an included adapter that turns the unit into a mobile. Be careful when you compare; this adapter isn't always included and could cost $20+. Also note it's range as a portable is limited, but then again, that's the nature of the portable CB beast."
2,"Great idea, poor ergonomics","I bought this CB for my Jeep in hopes of having a multi-purpose unit that would allow me to communicate well with other Jeeps when I was spotting them on the trails. It performed well, but the ergonomics were very poor. It has no hook that would allow for a convenient and accessible place to store the unit while driving. Also, the channel change buttons are very close to the PTT (Push-To-Talk) button, so I ended up changing the channel every time I tried to talk.I imagine that time spent with this unit would have enabled me to get comfortable with its ergonomics, but I decided instead to return the product."
1,Midland CB,"This was awful. I could get no reception at all while in my car and live in an area where there are 3 interstate highways and 2 interstate beltways. If I stepped away from a vehicle I could get periodic fragments of CB reception. I even pulled off the road into a rest area and the reception was virtually non-existent using the attached antenna. Only when I used a trunk mounted more powerful antenna could I get a signal. But then again, that defeats the purpose of having a portable handheld."
1,I don't recommend wasting money on this.,I bought this cb less than a year ago. In that time the LCD screen has LCDs missing so I can't tell what channel I'm on. It also doesn't get any reception at all after trying 3 different style antennas. I have used this maybe 5 times while off-roading and I would not waste my money on this thing. Not happy at all! Money wasted!!
3,"It's ok, but not what I expexted","It's ok, but I got it for my motorcycle, and although it is a perfect size, midland does not make a headphone for a helmet, nor a antenna for a motorcycle. So I have been shopping hit or miss,(mostly miss) for a helmet set that works with this radio and an antenna that I can put on my motorcycle. So far it has cost me more that the radio and I still don't have a full set up yet."
1,Does not work as described,"CB does not work as described. Even bought the Cobra antenna (27"") still did not work. Returned within two weeks. Amazon did do a good job on taking back the product and crediting my credit card."
4,Midland 75-882,"The item was delivered right on time and works great. Excellent small size! Reception is marginal with the flexi antenna, but much better with the SUV-mounted whip. I love the mobility and power flexibility; batteries, car charger, rechargables. A very versatile unit at a reasonable price. You can't go wrong with this unit; it goes everywhere."
5,Excellent,"I had one of these for several years before it died a natural death and will be getting another one delivered very shortly. It is highly convenient, and with an attached whip-antenna, I was able to reach just as many miles as someone with a non-handheld radio. And I love the convenience of having everything (all the controls)in my hand."
3,MIDLAND 75-822 40 Channel 2 Way Radio,"Cool little radio, transmits very well, but reception is very poor. low volume and what seems to be high level of background hum on receive. Not sure if i can live with it. Will come back and revise with full eval later."
4,"Not too bad, but watch out for faulty ones","When I received the handheld radio, it didn't work. Right out of the box. I talked to the distributor and they replaced it right away. This second one seems to work fine; without any drops, broken plastic, or anything else. I'm pretty confident if you get one that works right out of the box it'll be a fine piece of equipment."
4,Portable Midland 75-822,"Excellent product for travel and other type usage. It easily fits in my glove box or coat pocket. I am pleased with this product thus far. It has good sound and clarity. Many different options on the unit are available however, when in a vehicle an adapter should be included to securely hang in the vehicle. The belt clip is good but not when using inside the vehicle. I would recommend this product for purchase."
2,I Sent It Back,"It's a nice looking rig and it worked OK with a folding HT antenna affixed to the top. I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it. I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roof-mount antenna. Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles (verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end).As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio's jack, the radio's jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack. This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn't screw on more than 1/2 turn. This is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of QC.I sent it back for a refund. Spend another $35 to get a full-size name brand CB that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier."
4,Perfect,just as described what a wonderful gift this will make hope they like it they have wanted one for a while
4,Nice package,The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the lack of SSB on this unit. Otherwise is is exactly what I have been looking for. Newer trucks don;t have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on in.
4,c/b midland,after I received this c/b I took it along with me on a motorcycle trip with other motorcycle people which had c/b on there motorcycles. It worked but not like the installed ones but I didn't pay $750.00 for it like they did.
1,Low quality movie- in many ways,"This movie seemed like a cheaply made, run of the mill, dumbed down ""family"" film. The kids laughed at the part where the dog flies and when the other dogs attempt to fly- and that was about it.The storyline seemed to drag on with no real clear way that it all worked out- it just did (surprise!). The ""mild crude humor"" wasn't needed for the story and had the kids all turning to me with ""uh-oh"" on their faces. Kids can have a healthy sense of humor without the farting and playground humor.The parents seemed very out of place and awkward.FYI- there is a alternative lifestyle protrayed in the movie.I thought about donating it to the library, but then just threw it in the trash after we watched it (something I very seldom do)."
3,I actually give it 3.5!,"Okay, so I went to the video store to rent a movie, but I couldn't find anything that I wanted to see, so I rented good boy! I know it's rated PG, but why PG, I mean it doesn't seem like a PG movie, more like G, because it's a kids movie. Anyways, I like the movie, but it's not one of the movies I'd buy right away!"
2,Predictable On All Sides,"I just saw this movie and I have to say it is way too predictable which brought it down alot. I mean, the kid that doesn't fit in, two bullys, a girl that he likes later likes him, they're going to move and the boy hates it, the dog becoming his best freind, Hubble(the dog) later likes humans, Hubble tries to convince the Greater Dane that dogs and huumans should rule equally, and the list goes on and on and on. The reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because I liked some of the humor."
2,Entertaining,We watched this as a family and were entertained. Do we really need a token gay couple in every movie/TV show? This is a kids movie! Back off the gay agenda.
3,Can I have a cookie?,"I thought this movie was average. I was hoping it would be a lot more funny than it was. I would have to say that it was more cute than funny. I love the animals they casted, especially the little grayhound. This has been done before, but I thought it was more tastefully done here simply because all the voices fit so well with the dogs. I was also happy to find that there were extras on this DVD. There's a behind the scenes, a place where you can find out the type of dog each one is plus a little bit about them, a dog trainer showing how you can train your dog, and a few other things. You can see the people behind the voices of the dogs in this section as well. It was interesting to learn the information they had here. Overall, I would definately suggest renting this. Although I thought it was average, I might consider buying it since it was a cute story."
2,Good Boy is just okay,"Maybe okay is too positive of a review. This movie wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just there. Not a whole lot of humor in this story about canines from outer space, but it's still a nice, wholesome, family film. There are definitely some good scenes that children will enjoy, and the animals are definitely cute, but I can't recommend this film. It just did nothing for me."
3,Cute movie if nothing else is available,"I like Mandy Moore but this movie wasn't great, despite the range of cast members. It barely held my interest even though I can usually get into a chick flick pretty quickly."
1,I saw this on Netflix and want my money back,The worst movie of the year 2011. The acting in this film was a joke. They were basically reading the lines. So dissapointed in Mandy Moore who is a fine actor. I can tell she tried really hard. There were no chemistry between any of the cast. Awful director and directions. Even Mandy Moore was just reading lines. We watched it on Netflix and would like to get our money back : Yes. It is that bad. Please do not buy this movie.
3,Generic Romantic Comedy,"If you like a good cheesy romantic comedy, then you will like this movie. It's the generic plot line, but it's cute and kind of funny. I liked it, but I like that sort of thing."
2,"Love, Whine, Repeat . . .","I actually turned this movie off half-way through because I was tired of the same scenarios playing out scene after scene . . . okay, here we go again . . . I wasn't even the least bit interested to continue watching to find out what happened in the end"
2,"Love, Wedding etc.","Light predictable movie, Brolin doesn't make a good whiner over bad marriage, actor, it diminishes his craft. Seymour acts how she looks, a crone."
2,waiting for part two,Mediocre at best. Had higher expectations for this flick. still waiting for part two to be released. hope its soon.
1,Boring and Cheesy.,"Boring and Cheesy. Couldn't finish it. Characters that were boring, hair that looked awkward. It was horrible for so many reasons."
1,At a Loss for Words,"I am usually a vocal person with plenty to say, but this flick was so bad it has left me almost speechless. The script was so poorly written that I was bored stiff, the characters were so unlikeable that I didn't root for them or care what happened to them, and the acting grated on my nerves. It was free on Amazon Prime so I didn't waste any money on it, but I would like to have back that time I spent. It wasn't hip; it wasn't clever; it wasn't touching. Just a lame movie that tried way too hard with way too little."
5,Super cute!!!,"Its nice to see Mandy Moore again, and the couple are really cute together. Definitely watching again!!!! The movie was in great quality and had tons of great stars in the movie. Family enjoyed :)"
1,Nothing good to say about it...,"This movie is awful. The acting is pitiful, the script is ridiculous and there's nothing to keep you drawn in. I'm dissapointed, i was looking forward to seeing it."
3,A quirky view into marriage and familial relationships.,"This movie is not as bad as Entertainment Weekly made it out to be. It was touted as one of the worst movies of the year. I would not say that. I'd say if you are a fan of romantic comedies and glimpses into the lives of how different marriages and people operate, give this a shot. It is no where near perfect, and is definitely one director's vision into a movie like this. The acting isn't great either, and sometimes Mandy can get to be too much. BUT if you can rent it for cheap or catch it on one of the movie channels (Showtime is running it already), go ahead and take a chance and watch it if it's up your alley. It's only 1 1/2 hours, so hey, if you don't like it then you only lost 1 1/2 hours of your time. I just don't like movies that are actually watchable to get such a bad rap.Take a chance on this one; hey, you may actually love it!"
1,don't see,"This movie was seriously disappointing. The movie tries to be comedy, romance, and drama. It just doesn't work. There is no spark between Moore and Lutz. I find both characters whiney and immature. Whoever wrote this has no sense of how a real mature relationship works which should have been the backbone for this comedy nor does the writer have any sense of what a therapist should look like."
4,i like it,Was a very cute movie. I really like the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in love.
3,Good to pass the time,Cheesy movie but story of family and love so how can you not resist. If your it will help you pass the time.
2,drags,Not very good. The movie has good characters that never take off. I was bored and considered many times turning it off. Disappointing.
4,The stresses of marriage,"This isn't the funniest romantic comedy, but it works pretty well as a movie. The movie features the rocky marriages of a divorce councilor and her parents'. The ups and downs in the marriages seem realistic and not overly Hollywoodized - something I appreciate as a married person myself. The plot even had a few original twists and turns. I for one was actually surprised by the ending, something I can't say about another romantic comedy I've ever seen. Overall, not bad."
1,bad movie,"Agreed. I found this movie to be a huge waste of time. There is nothing good about this movie. The main actors have NO chemistry. What were they thinking here? Too, what 28 year old has their own psychology practice? So inexperienced and immature and no one to guide her? The polish marriage thing is super dumb. Too, the sister is new york accent and none of the others, and the mom british. strange. The director and casting director blew it on this one for sure and the script = bad. really horrible."
1,don't even waste your time,"I'm forced to put a 20 word review but there's just one word to say - ""HORRIBLE""!!! It has a good cast so not sure if it is the script, poor chemistry or bad directing."
2,Not seems like original battery,when battery die it just die instantly while original battery beep beep so many times i don't think this is original battery
3,a battery for Motorola RAZR,"The ""brand new original"" battery is not what I expected. Actually, it is a little better than my old one. anyway, everyone must realize that this price will not give you a complete satisfaction."
3,br50 battery,Company very easy to work with. They exhibited a willingness to cooperate to make things right. The product doesn't live up to my memory of the original battery that came with my phone. They offered a warranty exchaznge but I've sat on it so long that I feel wierd sending it back now.
1,Does not hold a charge,I would have been better off setting my money on fire and watching it burn in front of me as this battery is completely defective. It worked for one day and then stopped holding a charge. Caveat emptor! (let the buyer beware)
2,Not much of an improvement,"I have had my Razr since 2006, and it finally started needing a charge every 36 hours or so. I bought this battery because I understood that Li batteries lasted longer. Now it seems to need a charge every 48 hours, and when the indicator goes yellow, I get almost NO grace period before it goes red and dies. I have heard that a lot of folks have issues with their Razrs; I guess my time is coming!"
2,It is not what I expected,"I ordered this for my cell phone because my battery was running out by the middle of the day, well this new one does the same thing. is it used.?"
3,razr battery,Shipped very quickly. My husband and I each have an older razor phones-he needed one type battery I another. The new battery has extended the time we need to charge but it still seems the charge goes down very quickly. I'm not sure it's the battery-could be the phone is just getting too old!!!
4,Good...so far...,"Based on reviews of all the BR50 replacement batteries, seems very hit and miss, so I took a gamble with this one. I've had it 2 weeks. When I first put it in, charge lasted 20 hours, then I charged it up fully overnight, and it lasted 9 days, so thats pretty good. However, I do not use my phone a lot, no texting. I'll update after I've used it a couple more months. Some of these other reviews seem a little too glossy.UPDATE: 12/2/2012. Well, battery is still going strong, however no heavy use of phone, no text. Therefor a good deal for me."
5,Fantastic,It's better than having a new phone; the cost was more than reasonable and I still have the phone that I know and have always had. It lives once again. I'm going to buy another one today.
3,Not quite what I thought it would be,"I ordered 2 of these batteries for our phones that are going on 3 years of age with the original batteries in them. When they came in, I was disappointed to see that they didn't look like the original batteries. Oh well, if they work then who cares how they look. I installed them and fully charged them and then to my surprise, they ran down pretty quickly even without a lot of phone use. In fact, the original 3 year old battery charge lasts longer by a couple of days. When I contacted the merchant, he promptly refunded my credit card charge without any hassles. For that reason alone, I would give him a thumbs up."
2,Battery is not good at all,Battery is not good at all. The new battery could not handle vibration mode. The battery goes dies after 2/3 phone call receive in vibration mode
4,Replacement battery for Motorola cell phone,Takes charge easily and works as advertised. I have several of them just in case they become hard to locate in the future.
1,not satisfied,the item was not as described. It looked worn out and didn't work on my phone. i don't recommend buying this product.
2,Battery not so powerful,"This must be a second or a recycled battery as it does not hold a charge. For the price I paid I should have known! Oh we'll, could have sent it back but not worth the bother. My loss, their profit! Have to have a bad experience once every 100 or so amazon purchases!"
4,"Awesome Just like new,again.......","I was so surprised after I received my BR50 replacement battery, now my phone stays charged and there is no need to recharge constantlythank you I recommend this product anytime......Larry"
3,Great replacement!,"Battery was a decent price and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time. Not as good as the original but it brought my phone back to life, so it will do until its time for an upgrade. No way i'm paying full price for a new phone."
5,Good battery.,"This battery arrived safely packaged and with almost half charged. When installed it charged quickly, and seemed to hold the charge well. Doesn't overheat any more then usual, and everything seems to be in order."
2,Battery for razor phone,"I still have my old faithful razor phone. The battery was dying and it costs $ 27 to get a new one made.(they have stopped manufacturing new ones). I took a chance on this site for only $ 6 knowing it would be an unused older battery. It was, 3 years old, but 2 years newer than mine. It doesnt last more than a few hours, you get what you pay for. Sorry, this was a flop."
1,buyer beware,"I received the battery and charged it before use for 24 hours. I put it in my phone and it lasted about 1 hour. I called the vendor for a replacement and after a very long conversation they agreed to send a replacement. Then I received the wrong battery. Called, they said they would replace it but after 2 weeks I just filed for a refund. I wont order online again.MOTOROLA OEM BR50 RAZR V3 V3a V3c V3g V3i V3m BATTERYMOTOROLA OEM BR50 RAZR V3 V3a V3c V3g V3i V3m BATTERY"
3,OK Batteries for me,"I'm not a big user of my cell phone. These batteries are no where as good as the original but for 4 bucks what do you expect. I got 6 months out of mine and would have to charge about once or twice a week. For me, the battery is worth it. For a heavy cell phone user, maybe not."
4,spare batteries for Razor V3M,These batteries seem to be performng just fine ( so far). Delivery was prompt.
4,V3m battery,"I bought two of these batteries to replace my original which was about finished in my RAZR. They work very well. They do not hold power the same as the original, but they are very close (~80%). They are an excellent replacement for my dying original battery and for the cost, I bought two so I would be ready with a spare if needed. They shipped very fast and within a few days I had the problem of having to charge my cell after every call solved. I recommend them for these reasons; price, availability, and quality."
5,Worked similar to the original,Worked exactly similar to the original battery performance wise but at much less cost.DSG
1,Fraud,"The battery BR50 ( Two ) I recived are used don,t get charge, I paid for new batterys and I got used batterys.Can I do something to get my money back or new batterys?Thank you for your help.Carlos Cueto."
2,No Better,"I replaced a battery that was not holding a charge like it did new. This battery I bought as ""OEM"" is no better than my old one that is worn out. My original OEM battery held a charge for two days of my usage, This ""new"" will not last a full day."
1,this battery sucks,"I recently purchased this battery, making sure to get a Motorola instead of an off brand. The battery worked properly for about a week and now won't hold a charge for more than 4-5 hours. At the price it isn't worth sending it back, but I have learned my lesson. When your battery dies you might as well buy a new phone."
1,dead battery,"I bought this battery, and it is definately not OEM. The paper cover is clearly a poor copy and the battery was dead and would not charge. I finally got the phone to show charging, but after 24 hr on the charger the battery was still dead and disconnecting the charger resulted in no power at all. I tryed contacting customer support both by email and 5 different phone calls. All result with a recording and no contact and no return email. Do not buy this piece of junk.John R"
1,Battery life is only one day,Battery life is only one day. I have to charge it daily. I am not happy
4,BR50 Review,"Received product in timely courteous fashion. However, product wasn't holding charge initially. Tried recharging repeatedly with same result. I contacted seller, who showed concern. Seller replaced product promptly. The battery that was sent to replace my original purchase was fine, no problems, and is in service now. I would purchase another BR50 battery."
1,Battery for cell phone,"I received the Motorola OEM BR50 Battery in a timely fashion, but it did not work. I will never buy such a battery online for cell phone."
1,USELESS WON'T HOLD A CHARGE,THE BATTERY I GOT IS A WAIST ... USELESS ... DOES NOT RTECHARGE!NICE RIP OFF! PRICE TOO LOW TO RETURN ... POSTAGE COSTS MORE.
3,Nice Product,It arrived on time as stated. It works good like expected with no complaints so far. I will consider ordering from this site again.
3,Motorola Battery,First day felt good about my purchase but later on it was just working like my old one. Have to see if something wrong with battery or my phone.
3,Cheap and it works,"Shipping costs were very high, but the cheap price made it worth it...these batteries do not last as long as the motorola one that came with my RAZR....seem to take only an hr to ""fully"" charge up....these are not motorola batteries...they are generic, no name batteries"
2,Fast battery drain,"Battery had a cheap price. I guess you get what you pay for. Have to recharge every couple of days, and that is without using it much. My old battery still held a charge longer."
3,Cheap substitute battery,"I really would like to rate the Motorola Razr, because I hate it. It's so overrated. The original battery didn't last long at all, probably because I overcharged it when I forgot and left it plugged in overnight. Anyway, since I plan on getting rid of this phone as soon as my 2 year contract is up, I didn't want to buy a new (and expensive) battery from the phone store. The price of this battery, even with the shipping costs, is much lower so I took a chance. The battery works adequately enough and although I still have to recharge it alot, I don't feel so bad because it's so cheap."
2,Starting to fail after 6 months,I purchased this battery six months ago and it is already starting to fail. It has to be recharged almost every day. You get what you pay for.
1,"Works great, but batteries die too fast!","I got this battery exactly a year ago - in December 2009. Now it is dead. It can't hold a charge for two days when you even do not use a cell phone. It goes from full bar right to red just from opening the cell phone and dial a number. One ""Hello"" and you have the signal that the battery is low. It maybe worth its $5 dollars that I paid for it. But not more than that."
1,"One week ""new"" BR50, charge everyday","I bought one new BR50 battery. After one week, I need charge this new battery every day. You decide the quality of this ""new"" battery."
1,just horrible,"This battery makes you happy when you just opened the package. It does charge, holds the power for a few hours and dies. Considering the price of the battery, I don't think the manufacturer controls the quality, if you are lucky, you will get a good one, I suppose."
1,shady product,Delivery time was great (4 days) but the battery once fully charged last LESS THAN A DAY! What's up with that? This can't be a genuine product or at least not brand new. It appears to be new but it can't be. Glad I only paid $5 for it although truthfully its not worth more than $2.
1,Used goods - in same worn-out condition as the ones being replaced!,"I purchased two of these batteries, to replace the aging batteries in our phones. First, the package arrived with only one of the two I had ordered. After contacting the seller, and waiting two weeks, the other finally arrived. Upon installation, I noticed dirt and wear patterns on the battery contacts, indicating that these ""OEM"" batteries are in fact used batteries - out of other phones just like mine. They appear to be the same age, as they dies just as soon as the original batteries did. Oh well...ripped off for another $15.00 I should have known that a deal this good couldn't be true!"
1,Poor condition,"I bought two, only one works, other one can be charged but can not use, and I do not know how to return."
1,Doesn't even pretend to be OEM,"This has got to be the biggest piece of junk I've gotten from Amazon. It can't even pretend to be an oem battery because it looks nothing like the real oem, if fact it's so shoddily made that nobody even put a logo on it. I wouldn't either if my factory was turning out this garbage. It's a battery, so how bad could it be? Well, for starters, it's obviously too small and doesn't make good contact with the pins inside the phone. You move the phone at all and it powers down. So, it's kind of hard to even judge whether it's a decent battery electrically since it won't keep the phone powered reliably. (and no, the real oem battery didn't have this issue in the phone) Total junk. Avoid seller Cellular4all.I'd return this thing, except at the price it's not worth my time."
1,Won't hold a charge :-(,This is not a battery so much as just something to fill the space a battery would take and make your phone a little heavier than no battery at all. It would not hold a charge for more that 4 hours. Complete Chinese junk and I'm not talking about the boat.
1,Motorola Razor Battery *brand new* DOA,I bought this brand new battery for a used Unlocked Motorola Razor. The phone was going to be a gift for a relative overseas. The battery is DOA. I charged it first thinking the battery was drained. Four hours later the phone wouldn't power up. I put in the old battery and voila everything is working. I just wasted $5 and four hours of agony. Why would a seller bother to ship a battery that is dead without testing it. Don't buy from this seller folks.
1,Same old thing,"Extremely disappointed in this product. It isn't the sellers fault, but the Razor can't hold a charge longer than 35 minutes.I bought this battery in expectance that maybe it would be better. I was totally wrong. Thankfully I bought a new phone.Don't waste you're time buying a new battery,instead save up and buy a new phone! Trust me I did."
1,Bad Battery,I ordered this battery for a Motorola Razor phone.When the battery finally arrived I installed it in the Razor V3 and the phone screen said INVALID BATTERY.
2,Weak,"I began using my old phone because the newer one died. The battery didn't last so I ordered a new one. Unfortunately, it really doesn't last much longer and I need to recharge it daily even if I don't use it."
1,This is NOT an OEM,"This battery must be a used battery and NOT an OEM. After charging the battery up, it only lasted 2 days. That is if you didn't use the phone, but if you used the phone it lasted just over a day.After a week of constantly recharging it, it dropped to last then 12 hours of power, but again if I use the phone it died. I didn't get even 5 minutes of usage.Bottom line; don't buy any batteries from them again. It's not weard the price. Your better off paying extra money for battery from other company then this one."
1,"For $4 what can you lose? Well, $4.","My old battery holds a charge much longer, 5 minutes talk time instead of 1. This can't be a new battery. It's garbage. My advice: Don't waste your time or $4."
1,Cloned Garbage,"rip off cloned junk,Invalid battery error, voltage output way below 3.7v ,,,Amazon is out of line letting sellers like this rip off their customers.I should have known better, a $40 battery thats selling for $5"
1,won't charge,"Placed this battery in my Motorola Razr. Screen says ""unable to charge."" I'm returning it. Don't waste your money."
2,Motorola razor battery,The delivery and the price was fine but the battery performance didn't seem to be what you would expect from a new battery. It doesn't hold a charge very long.
1,Junk Battery,"Defective batteries, both batteries I purchased don't keep their charge or never get 4 bars after a full charge.On one phone I complete the charge with four bars, I turn on the phone and only get 3 bars.The other battery after a complete charge of 4 bars at night, then turn the phone off, the next morning I turn the phone on and get 1 bar without ever making a call, standby time less than 1 minute.These batteries are defective and are a piece of junk. Period"
1,Battery won't hold a charge,"Not happy at all. I could have just gotten a bad battery, but this one won't hold a charge more than a couple of hours. The one I'm replacing holds a charge longer."
2,2 out of the 4 I purchased did not work.,"I purchased 4 of these batteries and only 2 of the batteries are in working condition. So I would say 2 stars for the battery. It doesn't hold a charge and it says invalid with my phone. The ones that work, work fine though. Buyer beware."
4,Battery Good Battery,It is a battery a good battery It is a good battery IT IS A GOOD BATTERY It is a good battery It is a good battery
1,Junk Junk Junk,"I had the original BZ60 battery in my phone and it lasted for quite awhile, held a charge well. One day it died so I brought my phone into AT&T and they fitted it with a BR50 battery. Phone only lasts 2 days on a charge, junk junk junk - and this one probably wasn't a counterfeit, I can imagine how junky the counterfeits are!"
1,cellphone battery,"What was delivered to me I think it's not brand new, it's not working as it supposed to do."
5,Very pleased with it!,"Prouct was delivered on time, in great condition and working 100%. I'm very pleased with everything, form placing the order to reciving it."
1,Review of Motorola Original Equipment OEM Battery BR-50 For Motorola Razr V3 V3c V3i V3e V3t V3m Pebl U6 BR50,Motorola Original Equipment OEM Battery BR-50 For Motorola Razr V3 V3c V3i V3e V3t V3m Pebl U6 BR50The battery supplied does not hold a charge long enough to last bthrough a normal days use like the original did.
1,junk,"I bought 2 of these batteries. I didn't expect much for less than $3, but they would not even hold a charge for a full day on standby, or a full conversation."
4,Motorola Battery,"Got the item quick but there were no instructions on how to start it. At the moment, everytime I use my phone, it drains fast."
1,Do not buy this item. Battery does not keep charge,I bought this battery because of the price. It does not keep a charge and I doubt if it is a new battery as described.
3,just as I expected,"I bought this extra battery for spare use. It is just as I expected. The battery after fully charged lasts a couple of days under normal use. I received the battery after a few days,which is what I come to expect from Amazon-fast and efficient services."
2,Not what expected,"At first it took the seller a while to ship the battery, when it finally arrived and I put it into the phone and charged it - it does not keep the charge like previous new batteries I purchased. I have to recharge it every two days. Not satisfied at all."
1,Battery was useless within a week,"This battery was purchased as a replacement for the battery that went bad in my Motorola Razr V3 cell phone. Battery arrived quickly in what appeared to be perfect condition. Within a week after putting this new battery into the cell phone, the battery expanded, knocking off the back of the phone and rendering it useless. Instead of purchasing another battery, I purchased another cell phone. I would NOT recommend this Motorola product."
5,good solid battery,"very satisfied, this is simple really and it is expected to work, and this just did that, some of the 1* reviews had me scared, but I think I will attribute that to sheer bad luck of those buyers, the phone easily lasts for 2.5 - 3 days without a recharge, and its been a month, so its no first week works and then breaks kind of thing. If it breaks now I would think its well worth the USD 3 I paid, and end up buying another one. It shipped free for me too. Mostly wont break though.Really satisfied...."
1,pathetic battery life,Avoid this seller...I stupidly ignored the other reviews on the longevity of the battery life. I order two batteries. Each one took a charge for one day and after that they wouldn't take a charge. The look like the real thing but the quality is terrible. Waste of money and time. I won't get suckered into this scam again.
1,Don't waste your money even if its cheap!,"I purchased two of these because they were so reasonable. After trying both out, I put the old battery back in because they were so bad!!!! After a full charge I could make only one short phone call. Not even worth the low price I paid. These are garbage."
1,USED WON'T TAKE A CHARGE,BATTERY APPEARS TO BE USED. I TRIED TO CHARGE BATTERY IN RAZOR PHONE. IT WOULDN'T TAKE A CHARGE. I PUT BACK MY OLD BATTERY IN PHONE AND CONTINUED TO USE IT EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD ONLY HOLD A CHARGE FOR A FEW HOURS WHEN TALKING.
1,"scam, beware","Bought this battery and it didn't hold a charge. Returned it with self addressed envelope as instructed on the label and never heard a word since. I called and left several messages and got no return call. Bummer, for such a little item! I would stay away from these guys."
4,So far so good..,"I bought my battery from CCMACCESSORIES. So far this new battery is working well, but it's only been a couple weeks. Unlike my original OEM battery that came with the phone that proceeded to bulge out and never allowed the back cover to stay on securely, this one is not bulged and works fine.I charged the battery for about 30 mins in the car in the Off state to full. Then talked to my mother for about 2 and a half hours to test it. Afterwards it stayed full charged for another 2 full days, with maybe another minor call here or there. In the two or so weeks I've had it, I've only had to charge it 3 times I believe. I think it's doing well, and hopefully I won't have to append this review with a negative update later. :)"
4,Great cheap replacement battery,"This was my second purchase for this battery, and it works great! Such a cheap alternative to replacing it with your cell phone company! Save us from having to get new phones."
4,Good OEM Replacement,"After 3 years of solid use, my old battery wasn't holding a charge for more than a day with moderate use. After replacing it with this battery, my RAZR lasts several days on a single charge. The price was a lot less than other replacement options (e.g. BatteriesPlus wanted ~$30 for a replacement battery). Considering the low price, this battery was definitely worth it."
1,Bad bettery,"This is a disappointment. The battery won't hold charge very long, just as bad as the Motorola garbage. Stay away from this replacement and stay away from all Motorola cell phones."
1,The items is not sealed when I received it,Firstly the item is not sealed when I had received it. It was quite disappointing. After using the item I had realised that the battery that I had is better than the one I had received from Amazon. Overall my experience is the worst till date with this product.
5,Cell Phone Batteries,"The batteries have met my expectations, and I got them at an excellent price. I hope that they are available when I need them again."
1,used,Motorola Razr V3 V3i V3c V3m Original OEM Lithium Ion Battery BR50 SNN5696B (Purchased on 09/03/2008)by Motorola battery's had to be used fully charged 1 or 2 calls poor review no more amazon for me
2,Battery Died When Phone Was Dropped,I was pretty happy with this battery until yesterday. I dropped my phone on the ground (cement) and it wouldn't come on after that. I tried the phone with a different battery at a Verizon Store and it worked fine!I've only had this battery for 2 months so I will try to return it.
3,Phone Battery,Have only had the battery about 3 days..So far it is working just fine..I will check back later to tell you more about how happy I am that it is still working great..Thank you
3,Cell phone battery,The service and price were great. I charged the battery when I received it but am questioning whether I should have. It seems to loose its charge pretty quick. I need more time to check this out.
3,cell phone battery,"Ordered 2 batteries, one works great and the other one won't keep a charge. Oh well you get what you pay for."
1,Will not hold charge,"I purchased a battery for my mother in law because she refuses to get a new phone. Unfortunately, the battery will only hold a very minimal charge, with about 10 minutes of talk time."
1,Garbage,"Total garbage. Does not hold a charge. Will completely drain after 20 minutes of regular phone use. Last a whopping 2 hours when phone is on, but not in use. DO NOT BUY! Spend the extra money and buy directly through Motorola."
1,overheats when charging; not much duration for standby charge,"I bought two, but they sent three; took 4 weeks to get in mail, as they'd warned when purchasing; wrapped up to look like OEM, but I'm thinking it's a fake; people selling it certainly haven't responded to my complaints; works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs. Wish I could give them NO STARS on this one."
1,10 hours stand by time.,"I bought 2 batteries because they cheap and I expected that at least one will work as expected. But I was wrong! One battery discharged at about 10h standby (!) time, the other a bit better after 15h. It is not the first time when I bought ""cheap"" battery at Amazon. The result was the same. Just do not waste the money! It is just look like real battery, but actually is a peace of junk!"
5,Motorola BR50 Battery,"I purchased a Motorola OEM BR50 replacement battery for my RAZR V3 cell phone. This battery is an excellent replacement for the original battery. It arrived fully charged and it lived up to its specifications as to talk time and standby life. Regarding the seller, order turnaround time was very fast. I would highly recommend the seller to everyone and I would definitely purchase from this seller again."
3,Battery Review,I've had good luck with this battery. My phone will at least stay charged 2 to 3 days where I was having to recharge daily before.
1,good thing it was cheap,This battery was cheap for a reason. It only holds a 12 hour charge. pathetic since the original would hold a 48+ hour charge.
5,So much better the regular Pop Tarts!,These are so much better tasting than the regular Pop Tarts. They are small thick more filling like candy bar size Go-Tarts! The taste is so hard to explain it's just something you would have to try! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I cannot keep boxes in my home with the kids eating them too :-) If I buy Pop Tarts they sit and the Go-Tarts get eaten 1st!! No heating is required either! The crust is just right.. not hard..... not too soft!
1,Not so Elegant Clock,All I wanted was a nice clock with an hourly chime. With this clock you get a different ridiculous melody every hour along with the hourly chime that really cheapens the so- called elegance of this clock.
2,Sweater is a problem,"The costume was generally fine. The glasses and wig in particular looked great. When we were trick or treating and it started getting dark, however, I had to pop the glass out of the glasses as they impaired my daughter's ability to see; they're shaded, and would be better and more accurate if they were only clear plastic.The sweater, however, was terrible. It is a turtleneck, but the neck won't expand. We tried stretching it over her head and it wouldn't go. We had to go out and get another replacement orange sweater.Would not order again."
2,NOT GOOD,"I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. THE PLOT WAS GOOD AND EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW. I JUST COULD NOT GET INTO THIS BOOK FOR SOME REASON. THE ENDING WAS FUNNY THOUGH. I DIN'T LIKE CAMP OUT BUT IF YOU WANT TO READ IT, GO AHEAD!"
2,Camp out Review,"This book is supposed to be a mysterious thriller. I didn't like this book because it said it was a thriller, but it wasn't. It is exciting because of the killing, but it was too far-fetched and it would never happen. The book seemed like it had no plot to it at all. I liked the language in this book, but the grammar in the dialogue was really bad. The characteers didn't fit in with the book. That is why I thought it was dumb."
4,Great,"This was an excellent fantasy novel. Dunkle has a very fresh voice and presents a wonderful view of goblins. I recommended The Hollow Kingdom to my students when it came out and I will recommend this one as well. The only flaw was the foreshadowing of the third book. It didn't need to be in there for the story, and seemed very rushed. Dunkle should have waited for the third book to write the third book."
5,Two quests,"First, a disclaimer, I have know Clare since I was a wee little child and have been enthralled by her imagination for (mumble) years.On to the review:I just finished reading her newest book a few nights ago and can hardly wait for the next installment. I love the premise that both Seylin and Emily go on a quest, even though Emily doesn't quite realize that she is on a quest when she first leaves to find Seylin. As with her last book, Clare keeps turning our usual conventions of the heroes/heroines being the beautiful people upside down and inside out, hammering home the idea that physical beauty has nothing to do with what is inside."
5,Fabulous read!,"I thought this book was great, it's my favorite in the series actually. The characters are so well developed, they all deepen from the first book, the story line is interesting, and I loved how everything came together so smoothly. As I've said about the first book, I wouldn't recommended this series for younger readers or for sensitive people, but if you don't mind a bit of darkness (an elf girl slashes her face at the beginning of the book to make her unwanted to her fiance because all elven woman die in childbirth and there is some cruelty to woman in the book) I would highly recommended this series."
3,Hm.,"I very much enjoy the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy as a whole, but this book...not so much. It felt rushed and a little stilted; very much like a large and uncomfortable bump in the road between Books 1 and 3 even if parts of it were necessary introduction for the 3rd. Despite all their running and doing the main characters didn't do a whole lot of developing, so in that respect it felt like wasted time and space.Even so, it's probably not a good idea to skip this book. You'll miss a few things important for the 3rd."
3,"Meh, over-priced little-book","I was disappointed in my copy of Recipes for Better Sex. First of all, the book was very tiny. Barely fits in the palm of my hand. Second of all most of the suggestions are pretty obvious. Finally, and most annoying- the author has a page with a quote which takes up every other page, and as far as I'm concerned makes this book THAT much smaller.Okay, if you have no other sex advice tip books to refer to...But a cheap publishing trick to make a small book seem bigger. 3 stars. Average, but I'd look elsewhere for advice books on sexual matters."
5,I loved this book!,"This is a book that I couldn't put down. In fact, I spent way too much time one night (early morning) and paid the price in sleep deprivation the next day! The characters are all so full and vibrant; it's as if Ms. Hobb didn't have to create these people, they were already there and alive, just waiting for someone to simply tell their story. This is the mark of a fine storyteller. I can't wait for the next installment.I have not read any other of Ms. Hobb's books before; now I will go out and buy the other series. Thank you for a great book!"
3,The beginning and the end,"The first book of Mr. Hobb I have read. The book captured my interest with the first few chapters. In the middle of the book, I found myself frustrated as if Mr. Hobb were taking particular delight in kicking me in the teeth. He seemed to find specail pleasure in crushing any hope out of his characters and his readers. I continued reading only because of habit and a desire to see if he could possibly mangle his characters further. The end of the book did hold out hope that the next book would have the possiblility of becoming entertaining again. This book will not be on my reread list unless the subsequent books are better."
5,Great books!,"If you like your characters to have depth, reasons for what they do and to be like real people, no one's pure evil and no one's pure good, then these are for you. What I like about this series is not only that the characters are great, but also that she follows some of them, one by one. They get one chapter each and take turns, which makes you scream when the chapter ends and you want to read more about that person, but then you start reading about the other one, and scream when that one ends, but then it's her again and... Wonderful, full of imagination and originality. I love them.The only bad thing is two rape scenes. I DON'T enjoy reading them. I'm thinking about cutting out those pages. They feel unneccessary and I just hate such scenes. But that's the only bad thing about these books and they're worth it, I promise. Read the first book and if you still love them, keep reading even though these scener come later on, they are not in the first book."
2,Unbelievably slow and never picks up,"I almost never made it through this book. There were several times where I almost gave up on it. It moves very slow and while, there are some interesting things happening, not much of anything develops until the last two chapters. Even then, however, it doesn't deliver.It was pretty disappointing because I LOVED Robin Hobb's Assassin series. They are some of my favorite Fantasy books. So, it was quite a let down when I read this book. It's still written quite well and the characters are deep and unique, but the story just doesn't go anywhere.At this point I don't plan on reading the other books in this series and hoping that the Tawny Man series will resume what I liked about Robin's stories in the Assassin series."
1,Paperback ?,"I do not want paperback books cluttering my bookshelves. If you know of somebody that does, by all means have at it. The book that I am currently reading, the hardcover of this, is well worth the time of any RH fan. There is no need to read the Liveship Traders series to be able to enjoy this, but LSTs searies will addd additional flavor to this series."
5,Better than Terry Goodkind,"If you're looking for a long fantasy novel, this is a pretty enjoyable read. Better than Terry Goodkind.I should point out that it's not really a trilogy, but rather a single novel that's divided into three parts. So don't expect either of the first two books to end in any sort of way. You need to commit to reading all three books.Initially, the book is confusing, because ""Hobb"" bounces around from character to character, including sea serpents, and at first you have no idea how they are related to each other or the story. But it's worth the effort. Once you get past the first third of the first book, the rest of the trilogy is a really enjoyable read.If you never read the Assassin trilogy, you could read this and never know that you missed anything. However, the various events that happen in this trilogy kind of give away the end of the last book of the Assassin trilogy."
4,Ship of Magic: The Liveship Traders,"Months after finishing this book, I could conjure up the characters and wonder how they made out in the sequel. The author created an intriguing world."
5,Fantastic,I was hooked from the beginning of this book to the very end of this trilogy. Lots of adventure and unforgettable characters wrapped up in a story you'll never forget. I would highly recommend this series to anyone.
2,Not as good as Farseer,I read this after having finished the Farseer and Tawny Man series and was disappointed. Maybe the second book will be better or maybe I just like books that take place in castles better but whatever the reason this has not struck my fancy. I will continue so as to finish the series but I hope Hobb goes back to Fitz rather than follow these characters around any more.
5,"Wonderful fantasy novel - complex, graphic, moving!","At first, I thought I would not like this novel. I'm not usually a fan of novels that dedicate a small section to one character, then two pages later jump you to another character. I find them too chaotic to read. However, this is one of the things that keeps me plowing through this series! No more do I get angry that the story is jumping to a new character, than I find myself totally caught up in THAT person's part of the story. There is amazing depth to the characters in this series...there are characters to hate, many to like, many to feel great sympathy for - all of the things that make me like a novel! You learn small glimpses of these people's pasts that make you *just* think you understand them - then they turn around and surprise you with something else!This is definitely not a typical fantasy - no mages, goblins, orcs, dragons....oops...well...okay.....maybe dragons...but none of that other stuff! Truly an exciting novel."
4,"Ship of Magic (The Liveship Traders, Book 1)","If you are bored with Jordan, have given up on Goodkind, and are just waiting for Martin to finally get out the latest, this series is a nice interlude. It's a nice change to the typical fantasy series becauses it is mostly a tale of the sea. This series should have a broad appeal, but may not be appropriate for young readers. I highly recommend it."
5,"fabulous story, fascinating writing","This is my first Robin Hobb book, but i can tell you it wont be my last. Her writing style, though a little long winded, creates a colorful picture of the events happening, and is always interesting to read. You actually appreciate the level of detail she goes into.This story is heavy on characterization. Like many others have said, the characters are realistic, dynamic, people. As they are interwoven into the plot(s), you get a feeling of sympathy, disgust (Kyle!!!!), or even frustration. Hobb does an excellent job writing the cast.With an intriguing plot(s), a variety of intersting dynamic characters, and great writing, i dont see how one could be disappointed with this book. I know it's one of the most enjoyable books i've read in a long time! I cant wait to read the rest of the series."
3,"Too many words, not enough plot","I think Robin Hobb suffers from the same problem as Anne Rice. If you use 3 sentences to discuss a frown on someone's face, I think you have 2 sentences too many.This book is not 'filled with action' as the synopsis states. There was hardly any until the last 75 pages (unless you count all the times one character slapped another)! It wasn't even until the last 150 that I began to even care what happened to the main characters. Before that, they were simply objects acting out the plot. Every one of them was so whiny or melancholy, I couldn't figure out why I was wasting my time with this book. *I* would have loved to be the one doing the slapping.I would have gladly given this book 5 stars if it would have had about 250 less pages. I *will* read the sequel, but only in paperback.Luckily, I have George R.R. Martin's new tome to occupy me for awhile."
4,Great series,"This entire series is a great one with a novel (and I believe unique) concept about the ""Live Ships"".Great read... always kept me turning the page. I didn't ""like"" the turn of events in the last book, but it was... real. ;)Read it if you like novel sci-fi/fantasy."
3,Struggling,"Well, I am struggling with this series. I finished the Farseer trilogy and and wanted to read the Tawny Man series but I asked some Amazon readers and it was suggested I read this series first, before I moved on to Tawny Man. So I am just about to start the third book in this series. I had such a hard time getting through this book, the first of the Liveship Traders. I like the characters, but it just seemed so, so slow, and I was so disappointed because I flew through the Farseer books. Things picked up a little at the end of the second book, but I am not going to give up. I feel the need to finish all three before I move on, if I find I like the third book better, I will post another review on that page, with a little edit here. Anyway, I just don't love this as much as the Farseer books. That is why the three start rating. Just to make sound not all bad, I love the idea of the Liveships...really, really fun."
4,Great Concept,"This is the first book of Robin Hobb's new series. The concept is really cool, ships made out of ""wizard wood"" that come to life. Hobb creates compelling characters and has a great knack for storytelling.The only criticism I have is that I find the pacing of the story a little slow. There's nothing in particular I can point to. Perhaps it the internal dialogue of the characters. Probably I'm just impatient for the plot to resolve."
4,Enchanting new fantasy,"Sea serpents, pirates, sailing ships that are alive, a feisty female heroine who is bereft of her rightful inheritance by a cold, calculating brother-in-law, a young priest torn from his vocation and forced into a life he does not want, tantalizing, teasing hints about the Rain Wild River folk that leave you eager for more, and yes, even politics - this enchanting new fantasy explores new ideas in a genre that all too often plays the same old tune. Perhaps there is a hint of influence from Anne McCaffrey's ""Ship Who Sang"" series, but the ideas here are fresh. The characters are solid, their dilemmas absorbing, and you alternately admire, then are irritated by them as they develop."
5,Excellent stuff,"A fresh approach, and some new ideas. Women and men with attitude and 3D characters. A good dose of humour and a fair bit of mystery.What more do we need? Makes such a nice change from the fantasy titles nowadays that seem to be written to a formula. I just hate the wait to the next one. Publish soon!"
1,An Original Idea....but,"I have been an avid reader of sci-fi and fantasy for nearly 50 years---I consider myself something of an expert. It was with great delight that I started this first book of the trilogy. There were some great new, inventive ideas...where would they lead? The author laid out some of these ideas and many, many mysteries which we knew were about to unfold. But who could hang on that long? I have finished all three books of the trilogy and in truth there is a good story here. You will find it in the first half of volume one and the last half of volume three. The rest is filler---it took me two years to trudge through it because I really didn't want to give up---but how many others would push through that. And then some of the mysteries---especially the who and what Amber is -- is a two sentence delivery as her whole purpose for being at the end. I can only imagine with the loose ends such as this left that it is set up for a trilogy sequel ... ouch."
3,Had they been Farseers...,"If you liked the Farseer trilogy by the same author, then you might not like this trilogy. The Farseer trilogy is like Star Wars mixed with LOTR. This book is like....people on boats. Not much here."
1,For the extremely imaginative only !,"After reading The Farseer Trilogy which was very promising, I decided to take another chance with the author and try The Ship of Magic series. This first book is very silly. The concept of a liveship which speaks to it's occupants was intriguing but it loses it's appeal as the characters were very annoying, and the magic was very unsophisticated. I tried very hard to find some good in this novel but it falls short of anything spectacular. Only for the extreemely imaginative and open minded. If you have your feet planted firmly on the ground, this fantasy novel is not for you. Goodkind fans will find this novel a hard read. The Farseer trilogy is far better."
2,Bleah...,"I was really exicted that Robin Hobb had a new series out following the really good ""Assassin"" trilogy.But this was just plain bad. Whiny, uninspired characters that ruined what could have been a good book.If you must read the series, do so at your own risk."
2,Avoid,"I'd never read any of Robin Hobb's books before, so I did not know what to expect. On the basis of this, I never plan to read any more. I hated this horrible book, and sold it off as soon as I could. I gave it two stars instead of one because Hobb does have some imagination and writing talent. But her book is full of stupid, unpleasant people doing stupid, unpleasant things to each other for stupid, unpleasant reasons. And as for the storyline involving Malta - Yuck! This girl is fourteen, and Hobb is female herself! Where the story can go from here I cannot tell and do not care. Avoid."
2,Ssssllllloooowwww starting,"Since I only read 50 pages, I'm not sure that it is fair for me to review, but I have read some very long books and enjoyed them. This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far. Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts. This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read. After all, it is our actions that define us..."
2,AWFUL SUPPORT!,"The product itself is decent and prints well, but jams when you try to print envelopes. Or, if it doesn't jam, the envelopes come out looking crooked. I called tech support twice, and first they told me that they can't help me because it's not their problem that it's printing crooked, but a problem with the software...That, of course, wasn't true because I was using Word, which is good with envelopes. The next time I called they told me that the envelopes I am using are too thick, which is also total garbage because I was using the most standard #10 envelopes in the world! They were just totally unhelpful!If you don't plan on printing envelopes, or calling tech support, it's a very nice machine."
2,A slow printer,"My office gave me this to replace my HP laserjet 1300. I tried it out for a couple of days and reconnected the HP, and I now have it on a shelf gathering dust. It seems to go to sleep and has to wake up again. With long documents there seems to be a long delay after a few pages are printed whilst more pages go into memory. Whilst it may be OK for printing documents of a few pages, it's not up to my demands, and I prefer my dedicated scanner (Fujitsu Scansnap) and PC fax software anytime."
3,Brother MFC-7220,"This product is not exceptional, but average, and worth the price paid. The confirmation is slow to print for faxes."
1,It might be faster to scribe than print using this machine,"WHEN this printer feels like printing, the quality is acceptable; unfortunately, that's just not often enough. It seems to lose its microcode about 40% of the time, meaning you need to turn the machine off, wait a few minutes and restart it - and pray to the print-god that it will finally work.Sometimes I just hand-write a letter or memo instead of ""fussing"" with it.Very discouraging. Try another brand."
4,Take your minerals,I take this with other supplements and I don't know what effects/benefits it provides alone.But i have improved healthwise by taking this together with whole food multivitamins and omega 3 fatty acids.This product seems to be one of the best minerals around.
5,I recommend this product,"ConcenTrace is a simple way to get minerals you probably lack in your normal diet. It's easy! Just put so many drops- 10, 20, 40 (whatever you decide you need or recommended by your doctor) into a liquid of your choice. I happen to use Emergen-C....a fizzy fruity drink packed full of vitamins which comes in many flavors. I purchased both products here on Amazon. A+ for both."
2,Not feeling Good.,"I'm going to be making an update to this to be more accurate with my review because it has only been one day since I started using this product. I started this product with 20 drops (as instructed) in my daily consumption of reverse osmosis water (figured it be a good idea to remineralize the water with good minerals after filtration) which is about 80 ounces spread through out the whole day. As of right now after about 1 day and a night I feel pretty terrible. I'm extremely tired, agitated, irritable, and a bit anxious. I'm not really sure why this is, perhaps my body is adjusting or its a detox reaction. I'm very familiar with detox reactions so this could be the culprit but I didn't think minerals could do that. If anyone else felt like this in the beginning of using this product or knows why I might feel like this then I would greatly appreciate a comment from you."
1,"Bitter taste, made me sick and dizzy","This is a strong product, and it tastes awful.It contains a lot of heavy metals and It made me feel sick right after I took it. I had rapid heart rate, and nausea, which is not a good sign. Please be careful, and take at your own risk, it is not tested or regulated, who knows what's in it that makes some people sick.I reported it to the FDA, I am do disgusted with this company and its claims. Buyer beware, and read the fine print, it contains arsenic, and uranium... not good..."
5,Miracle elixir - goodbye to post-exercise cramping and beyond,"I perspire easy (profusely, really) during exercise, in particular. With the arrival of my 40's, so came post-cardio cramping (severe and sufficiently debilitating that I was strongly considering giving-up certain exercise regimens that I truly adore). One evening, after having played tennis, whilst awaiting the onset of the cramping condition (usually a couple of hours after exercise, despite being well hydrated), I patronized a health food store, and was introduced to ""trace minerals."" A four year relationship of bliss. That is, I could not more strongly endorse this product for muscle cramps. For what it is worth, very little, perhaps, I seldom recommend anything."
4,Keep healthy and active!,"These trace minrlas are amazing-just a few drops in our water bottles makes the difference between dragging and and being very alert and clearheaded, even after insufficient sleep. They really keep you going! i highly recommend these drops for your physical health and mental well being."
2,May help someone else better?,"When using the drops I noticed a definite change in the way I felt and not a very positive report either. I tried using several drops to a gallon of water and then anywhere from 1 to 6 or 7 drops in a glass of water. I tried about every experiment with the trace minerals I could and when using it with distilled water something just didn't feel right. It could be just my own body chemistry, I don't know, but I consider myself to be in fair to good health. I'm sure others have had a better experience with this product than I have."
5,This little bottle is Powerful,"This little bottle has alot of power, from cleaning out your system (to fight off virus'), to breaking up kidney stones. Whatever it is, if you are drinking bottled, distilled, or reverse osmosis water, you are missing out on your minerals, and this is a great way to get them. This is also good for your skin, place on at night, wash off in the morning. Your skin will look great, and it will clear up acne. (First time might hurt, but keep doing it, its cleaning out bacteria from your pores.) Its great use of what God has given us in the Great salt lake."
5,Fantastic Stuff!,"This stuff has done wonders for my son. He used to be thirsty constantly and would drink a tremendous amount of water, and then he also started to struggle to sleep for long periods at night. We suspected that he might not be getting the amount of minerals that his body was requiring and put him on this product. It was like someone had flipped a switch. Drinks more moderately now, and is sleeping great again. And so simple to use as well! We put a couple drops in every glass of water to get our minerals!"
2,Headache and taste,"I noticed a correlation between taking this and within 30 minutes getting a headache. Also, the taste (even the minimal serving size) was unpleasant. I give it 2 stars because I think the intent behind the product is good for those of us who like purified water and remove all the minerals. Overall, I was willing to get over the taste but not the headaches!"
5,JUST GREAT,Great product and great service. Couldn't find this stuff in any stores locally. Went to Amazon and got right to it.
3,Yuck,"We're waiting on other minerals to arrive. However, my wife needed some asap, this was the best stuff we could find. It helped her, but it tastes nasty. I mixed it with juice that masks the taste of this kind of thing, but it didn't work with this stuff. I won't say that you can't mask it; I can't say that you'll dislike the taste. It tasted like drinking cough medicine, I'll be happy when the other stuff comes in. You may not care how it tastes but I wanted to share my experience with it."
2,meh,"I'm a cyclist and because I do not eat a wide variety of food, I thought I would try this to get what I am 'told' I am missing in my diet. Personally, I did not see any benefit to using the product after a couple of weeks, nor did I 'feel' anything. I realize some folks like and they may feel there is some benefit, but for me...I am calling it snake oil."
2,Still tired after 2 weeks..,This product does not work on me. I did not gain any energy what-so-ever after taking the drops for about 2 weeks. I followed the direction as intructed. I guess it is just not for me!
1,Beware,"I bought this product and was surprised when I looked at the label and found that it contains lithium, a substance widely used to treat bipolar disorders and depression. Perhaps I am mis-informed (aren't we all these days?) but I do not wish to add this substance to my home-distilled water. I was already skeptical about the reports that distilled water is harmful because of the missing minerals, but for me this additive is not something I care to take my chances with. I've seen too much regarding the side effects of commonly used anti-depressives, and lithium is one of the most common. I've known people taking lithium and from what I could tell they were not doing well, whatever the cause and effect may have been. Lithium's metabolism is not well understood. I understand that lithium is always present in the human body at trace amounts, but deliberate supplementation is neither necessary nor well advised from what I can tell."
4,Bump Stopper Sensitive Skin .5 oz. Treatment (Case of 6),"This product work exactly as they said it would do, it stops bumps from becoming a problem after shaving, especially if you have sensitive skin. Unlike most other product that claim to do the same. This one works,I have no complaints , I would recommend it highly to anyone with bumps problems after shaving."
5,FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD,"This is not your usual romantic comedy. This one includes tales of mischief and adultery in a small English village. Tamara Drewe (Gemma Arterton), the town's ugly duckling has returned home after her mother has died to make the house ready for sale. She is a successful journalist who has been transformed with a nose job. The neighbor, Nicholas Hardiment (Roger Allam) is a successful novelist. He and his wife (Tamsin Greig) run a country retreat for a variety of authors who come for the peace and quiet. Glen (Bill Camp) writes about the life of Thomas Hardy, a life we find ourselves comparing to Hardiment.Tamara has her choice of lovers, both old and new. These include rock drummer teenage heart throb Ben (Dominic Cooper) and her old boyfriend Andy (Luke Evans) who dumped her when her nickname was ""beaky.""The movie was quirky and enjoyable. Mischief maker Jody (Jessica Barden) and fan of Ben provides us with the wild card excitement.F-bomb, brief sex, rear nudity"
4,Standard British fare with a punch,"This is fairly typical ""absolutely bloody hilarious"" British humor (which means an American will barely crack a smile) but Gemma Arterton is so sin-sational that 90% of men will rate this highly. Fans of Doc Martin will enjoy this and find it interesting, if not hilarious."
3,Body? Wow!,"The best thing in this film is the extremely attractive body of Gemma! The plot is weakish, the rock star boyfriend emetic, but it gets away with it. The main failing was that it was a Region 1 disc, and no info about this, and it made me change region once again..."
3,Spoilt by its language,What would have been a reasonably entertaining film was spoilt for us by the gratuitous (and totally unnecessary) use of the f word throughout the running time.
1,"Dumb, dumb, dumb................","I suppose in some circles a slight nod to Thomas Hardy will lift a truly bad movie to a higher level, but, for me, this wasn't nearly enough. I kept watching this ridiculous film thinking it was going to improve at some point, but instead it continued a precipitous decline into absurdity. If you have a tremendous ability to suspend disbelief and a moral compass which embodies the idea that repeated sex and adultery with random, inappropriate partners leads to happiness, then this is certainly the movie for you. Otherwise, it's a total waste of time!"
2,i bought this for my dad's x-mas present,"and i wish i never did. its cheap. right off the bat when i my dad opened it he play the last three 3 strings to see how it was tuned and all the last 3 strings broke, just like that.then we brought it up to the guitar shop to have nice string put on and have the guy tune it for us. and he said he has the same banjo in his book for 100 dollars cheaper."
3,Not really delivering the answer.,I thought this book would tell me the amino acids that build a brand - all DNA is built from just 4 such acids and I hoped that there was the same Watson & Crick insight - sadly no.It has some good building blocks but you are largely left to assemble them yourself.
2,you can find better,"I have been evaluating, and managing corporate marketing for years. too much fluff here. save your $10.00 unless you collect branding books."
3,its an ok watch,To be honest the watch looks much better on the site than on my wrist...I don't know what it is yet..but i dont get the same feeling...next thing the band looks very cheap...All-in-all its not a bad watch just not what i thought it was...thinking of giving it away....I did but other lorus watches - black - very nice!!!
4,Playfully Well-Written,This how to guide to playwrighting was packed with so many helpful tips that several readings are necessary to obtain them all. Very practical and helpful advice that makes this guide not only a must for aspiring playwrights but writers of all fiction genres.
3,If you want to be a playwright or just know more about plays...,"As a retired person, interested in reading, writing and lunatics, I purchased this book to help me with technical terms and tools of the playwright's craft. I am writing a play and the advice I received from friends is that I need to read plays and then read more plays.I've read plays, enjoyed each one and found that there is no one way to write a play. That's why I purchased The Playwright's Guidebook: An Insightful Primer on the Art of Dramatic WritingI find the Playwright's Guidebook to be very helpful. It is very easy to find information within its pages. Concepts are explained in a way students of the theater would appreciate. And I do.For anyone who would like to know more about plays and how they work, this is the book for you."
1,Pirates of the Carribean,"I found this game to be one of the most difficult, most poorly documented and least intuitive games I ever played.You start off the game with a crewmember to lead you through the start of the game. From there, you continue on your own. There is no primer on how to sail a ship. There is a minimal trainer on sword fighting but little feedback on how you're doing so you can modify your actions.After getting my ship sunk in a storm twice, getting sunk by random ships attacking me three times (including just showing up at my home port)and getting no feedback or instruction on how to survive those events or how to avoid them, I gave up and quit the game."
1,Not Sea Dogs 2,"Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves; Sea Dogs is one of the best pirate games of all time and Sea Dogs II had potential of being twice as better. Then Disney throws their moneybags that Bethesda to rush the release of Sea Dogs II and change the name to Disney's new movie Pirates of the Caribbean. Therefore we Sea Dogs fans now have Pirates of the Caribbean, which is full of bugs. The graphics are beautiful but it's so buggy that I cannot enjoy the game. I gave it a fair chance I wanted to see it succeed but I got so frustrated with the bugs in Pirates of the Caribbean that I destroyed the CD out of anger. I recommend everyone to not buy this game, instead buy Sea Dogs and send letters to Bethesda to cut your loses with Pirates of the Caribbean and make us a worthy sequel to Sea Dogs."
3,NOT Pirates of the Caribbean - just pirates,"This was purchased for a child, at the request of that child. Personally, I don't care for the game. It was clearly scraped together at the last minute to exploit the film - it's a generic pirate game with no distinguishing characteristics except Johhny Depp on the jewelcase cover. I rather resent that.In addition, it performs poorly with Windows XP, and there is no patch that I can locate. The 13-year old recipient of the game manages to make it work, but even he thinks it's a rip-off: fun enough, but nothing special. He's playing it while he waits impatiently for ""POTC II""."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"I must say that this is one of the worst games I have played since Outpost. The manual is utterly useless. It has hardly any solid information about the controls or flow of the game. The controls are non-intuitive and sluggish. The game play is very poor and kluggy. This game is so bad, I thought there must be a patch for it. But I was wrong. I am playing this on a P4 H/T with a GB of RAM and a G-Force video card. Unless you enjoy disappointment, avoid this game at all cost."
1,Bugs ahoy!,My computer is well within the minimum specs for this title yet I could not get it to run properly. Once I began a new game the thing would freeze. I've played many high end games on my computer with few if any problems. Please avoid as Pirates of the Caribbean has faulty (incomplete?) programing and might not work on your computer.
2,I wasted $50 on this.,"First off, there are like two games in this, which would make one think that it would be great.1. The RPG gameplay is pathetic, it is to hard, and at night, you cannot see whatsoever.2. You cannot defeat ships or even hit the ships. BAD!3. TERRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Oh My God,"Check it out, the ""gamer"" who swore how great the game is is from Bethesda! That's the same place as the company that made it, this guy's trying to sell his game on here! Shameful, dude."
1,"Worst game ever, period.","The controls are terrible. Once you get used to them, you realize that the combat engine is terrible. The graphics are nice, but so what? This game just isn't fun."
1,dunno,i got sum problem....installed the game...click on new game....there's a screen with the loading game...but it doesn't load at all...i've waited 1 hr but the game simply won't load...n then my system gets hanged...any ideas friends wat cud b the prob?my system requirements match.
1,Be sure your PC has the min specs - this is picky software!,"Be careful when buying this product - it states that it runs on many Window's platforms, but actually works on very few. The video and sound card requirements are pretty hefty. I made the mistake of buying this software only to find out I can't run it, and my laptop is less than a year old. Plus, the trouble shooting information is minimal on both the software and the official website. I ended up having to contact technical support. It looks like a great game if you can run it....."
3,"3 stars to bad, 2 to good","The specs are very picky i had to get a new card just to play it! The control is absulutly terrible. The game is perfect except for the control. Here they areleft click = go forwardright click = backwardsmouse x axis = steerThere is no straf left or right. graphics are superb. dont get the game for the playing, get it for looks. i suggest u buy morrowind."
3,It's no sid meyers pirates,"Beautiful graphics for ship sailing but tedious and not very interesting role-playing. I think the developers made a lot of questionable design decisions and there's not enough movie tie in - that's for sure. If you're waiting for a game that captures the adventure and thrill of being a pirate, Atari has announced the remake of Sid Meyers Pirates. This game is still -to this day even with all the flashy, first person shooters, etc. on the market, one of the greatest games of all time! So if you're selective about your pirate's games wait for sid meyers great pirates to come out, but if you can buy more then one pirate game then I'd say Pirates of the Caribbean is probably worth the money...or wait 6 months and get it on sale."
4,Great Pirates Game,"I have read some bad reviews and good reviews on this game before getting it..I have played it for about 3 weeks and completed the game...I think it was Great. The graphics, realism, sound, music score are superb. It is a nonlinear game with mini tasks to accomplish a main task. Definitely different from the 1st person shooter games I'm used to. The learning curve is extensive and you have to be very patient. The dialogue windows are corny but necessary. I recommend you read the manual twice and join GameSpot.com and get into their Pirates of Caribbean Forum....you'll pick up alot of tips. It's very important in the beginning to improve your skill points in Melee, accuracy and cannon....that's all I'll say on that. This game is definitely worth $19.99. Get it. If I can be of further help, email me at www.internaman@yahoo.com subject: Pirates of the Caribbean"
4,It has improved,The new charger for forerunner 201 has been redesigned to have an input range of 100-240 V. I damaged my original one in Egypt where the current was 240 V and the charger could not handle that.
3,Good Charger,"Charger does the job - charging the Forerunner 201 GPS watch.It would have been great to have a mutli AC voltage 110/220 transformer, or a USB connection."
4,A Wonderful Christmas Tradition,"I so enjoyed A Victorian Christmas Tea that I had to read this one too. The stories are so fun and uplifting. This is a cozy, curl up by the fire and read kind of book. Easy and enjoyable reading. It isn't overly romantic/sensual, for those of us that are more conservative."
5,great,My family is from this area so I got it for my brother for a Christmas Gift.I also love this book. great
1,it did not fit either one of my laptops,"I purchased this product in advance of buying a Dell XPS 17 laptop. I wanted to protect my new expensive laptop from surges. I actually purchased two in order to protect my older laptop as well. Well, too my dismay, once the product arrived I found out that NEITHER of them fit my laptop power adapters. They are absolutely useless if they do not fit modern computers and I would like to return my product for a refund, but I don't know how to do that really. If this was newegg they would respond to my review and tell me how to return it or replace it."
2,"Great concept, crappy quality","I love this concept. Its elegant and has the makings of a great product. Where this company has skimped is the internals, typical for low cost, made in China garbage. I own an IBM laptop with two prongs, it fit tightly and worked great for the first week. Then I noticed that it was beginning to develop some play. Well a few days later, it stopped working, either the contacts were damaged or something else happened internally. Anyways, I returned it to amazon and just ordered the APC Pro surge protector for notebooks. It was twice the price, but i'm hoping for ten times the quality."
2,laptop surge protector,"Surge protector is a great convenience since you can keep it attached to the cord and its handy when you need to plug in your laptop. But....it does not fit tightly enough into the cord plug and pops out if you inadvertently let the cord hang. I purchased 2 and had the same problem with both. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I ordered which described the same problem and I didn't report the problem in time to return it for a refund.TRC Lap Top Surge Protector 2 Prong 90473-10"
3,Light Regency Fairytale,"Just When He'd Fobbed Off the Last Brat, Another Appeared to Take her Place!Poor Lord Anselm! The dashing bachelor was forever plagued with dying relatives leaving their female children to his care. Indeed, he had squired so many a silly miss from schoolroom to marriage mart that he had sworn off women altogether.The current ward was far and away the worst. Cheeky as only a French girl could be, Yvonne de la Falaise had surely sent her papa to an early grave with her melodramatics and mischief. Thank goodness for her governess, Patricia Cottingham. So calm, so competent!But all was not as it seemed, or so Anselm learned and very nearly too late..."
2,Not my kind of game,"You know, I like RTS games in general and this one looked to be a good one. I read about it and checked a lot of online details about the game before I decided to pay full pop retail for a new game release. After about 8 hours of play I have to say that it's easy to play but not immersive. I just can't get into it. Novelty factor 2 hours then I lost interest. There is a lot of depth to the game but it is more work than fun when you get past the eye candy.Ran well on my computer at medium/default detail settingsOS: Vista UltimateCPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core AM2 2411Memory: 4098 MB DDR2Dual NVIDIA GPUs: NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GS in SLIIt could not handle high or very high detail. Frame rates dropped to unplayable during action. I have to assume that this game would not play well on older PCs. The game has a built in benchmark utility that was useful. I liked that a lot."
2,According to the demo,"I played the demo to World In Conflict. I would have to say the game is very much like the recent command and conquer with the aspect of troop limitations and gameplay. The gameplay is difficult with the idea that any fight could turn either direction. I still don't fully understand the complete aspect of the game. But for just a few hours play, I am going to say that the actual experience can be obtained through command and conquer. I will not be purchasing this game. I am entitled my own opinion, but feel free to try out the demo."
1,Overrated,"The game has amazing graphics, but it is being sold as an Strategy game, which it is not. Even when playing the multiplayer the game is way too fast, with players just massing units and throwing them to figth and die in seconds. The solo game is even worse, you can only play the very linear and predictible American Campaign, you don't have the option to play as Europe or the Soviets and there is no Sandbox option. This game promissed a lot and delivered very little."
3,World in Conflict Review,"As far as the game goes, I really enjoy RTS. Enough said.Other wise, make sure your computer can cook for you, brush your teeth and drive you to work before purchasing this game. My half decent computer barely played the lowest settings.Good game, recommend it not for the story, but for the elements of a RTS"
3,average game,"the game is ok,it has its limits like ya can't make your own custom games,ya basically have to follow the story line,i am more into games that you can have a straight forward battle,but to each his/her own,other then that its a cool game,maybe its better online against others"
1,World of Conflict Does not run,The web is peppered with users who cannot get this game to run on their computers and tech support is non existent. Both XPP and Vista are having issues with the game and there are many suggestions to fix it on the web none seemed to work. I run and XPS 1710 w/ Vista Business premium and the game would crash any time I picked a menu choice from the main menu. I would get a reloading resource and a stop functioning error. Bad programming and worse support. Demo worked fine.....
2,Too Much Money + scripted battles = 2 rating,"I think this games really limits what you can do - it doesn't allow you to deviate from the script. at all. It's kind of ""arcade"" in that manner and I guess that's why I don't like it. It's too much money for what it provides. There's too much competition out there and money is too precious for me to give this game a higher rating, even with its graphics."
3,World in Conflict,"What a redundant game. Eye candy wears off fast. Unless you are the best, you wind up helping someone else use the coolest feature of the game--thermonuclear weaponry. Got tired of this fast. Only plus was playing with my community, but that did not save this game. I gave it to my history class students; just put it on the counter and said, ""it's free!"""
4,Makes me miss the Cold War,"This RTS hybrid is a great take on alternative history. What if the Soviet Union had invaded Europe and eventually the United States in the 1980's? Before this game my only answer to that would be to go rent Red Dawn, but now I can actually take part in this great what if scenario. The gameplay is refreshing for the RTS genre and I like the reinforcement system, just order units and go. The story is absolutely great and with voice acting by Alec Baldwin whats not to like? The graphics are superb as well, environments can range from lush forests to cities to snow covered mountains and they all look great. The multiplayer component was fun for the limited time I spent on it and the mission editor is deep and requires some studying before attempting to use it. Overall a great game."
3,A Pretty Good Game BUT...,"I've been a long-time fan of RTS and RT tactics game designs and was pleased to get WIC. I've admired MASSIVE's approach to this genre through both Ground Control and GC2. Visually, this game is quite appealing but the problem is its overly frenetic pace. It is fully scalable so one can pull back to a global map or drill down to an individual unit. This was always the lure with GC and GC2 because the game was very exciting down close (the explosions, tanks rumbling, etc). The problem with WIC is the pace is so fast and so much is going on simultaneously that you almost always have to stay in the pulled back (global) view and that pretty much squashes the fun factor of an otherwise descent game. I would rather have it slowed down and bit and hoof it through the woods with an infantry squad once in a while."
3,"Strong opening, weak ending","It is good for ppl who doesn't own the original WIC, just $29.99 includes the expansion and the original game; however, for people who already owns WIC might find the expansion little bit disappointing. The expansion only has six missions, and 4 of the maps were from original WIC mulitplayer. Also, the soviet ending doesn't tell you much, and might leave you clueless. It is just feel like the later soviet side story is rushed to end(Strong opening, weak ending.) Cutscenes are top-notch like everyone said, it just need more contents. It is also sad many of those awesome WIC trailers video didn't make into the game."
2,Not my kind of game.,"This isn't what an RTS 'should' be. To that end, if you're a Starcraft/Warcraft fan, you'll find this game extremely close-ended and unentertaining. I became bored in the first 3 missions, and as impressive as the trailer or intro make it look, its much more dull and definitely not what you'd expect if you're used to base-builder RTS games like Age of Empires, Starcraft, Sins of a Solar Empire (the only good kind, in my opinion)."
4,Red Dawn 2,"This game is a blast to play. Being a Veteran who served in the 1980's, the Soviets were the biggest threat at that time and this game conveys that fact very well.The tutorial is entertaining; the Drill Instructor voice over is perfect. The game is easy to play and you don't have to spend a huge amount of time learning the controls. The game play and graphics are fantastic... I advise any potential player to read the box and make sure that your machine is capable of running the game.The only gripe I have is the load time between scenarios... a very minor thing compared to the overall game play. I highly recommend this game to any war buffs out there.... you won't be dissapointed."
3,Ok game. Didn't live up to expectations,"As the other reviews state, very little strategy. They just throw wave after wave of things at you and you watch things blow up. There seems to be no way to really ""lose"" because as your units get killed you can just ask for more with your reinforcement points.This would be a good game to get on the second go around after a price drop. Hopefully upgrades and add-ons will add a little more variety to the game.I find this one WAY less addicting than C&C;."
2,"Great graphics, but terrible gameplay","After being excited for several months prior to the release of this game, I was sorely disappointed after playing this game for the first couple of hours.The game is completely scripted and there is no deviating from the script. Each mission simply consists of you moving your units around to the designated spots so they can automatically shoot enemies for you. Simply put, there is no strategy in this game. The computer is looking for you to do something and if you do it, then you pass the mission.Those looking for a recreation of C&C; should go elsewhere. Although the graphics are great and if you have DX10 you can run dual-monitors, it simply does not make up for the $50 you have to spend to move tanks and troops around in a pre-defined fashion."
3,world in conflict,"Great game not easy to play have some control problems with windows 7, worked great on vista. will have to figure that out"
4,wwe fans must have,this game is great by far it is the best only like couple of things that need to be fixed like the season mode is to short and some of the people are in the wrong roster and why does batista look like a rat his face is wierd and another thing is mankinds entrance is wrong and why cant i use andre the giant in season ive allready unlocked him and there are not much weapons to choose from but i really like the buried alive matches and the other new ones and the blood rocks oh ya why dident thq put in that you cant go into another backstage arena great game
5,Casket Match's,In the Casket Matches there should be forcing the opponet that lose should not been on the game for a while or until the next draft lotorry or trade happen i hope this make it to Smackdown vs Raw 3(2007.thankyou jamie
5,Best Smackdown Ever!!!!!,"I have every smackdown ever made. This one is by far the best. The rosters are good the season mode is perfect and you can hear your guy talk to. The general manager mode is awesome you can even use legends. There are lot of good legends out of all my 80 PS2 games this is my favorite. It has a buried alive match on it a bar brawl and a fulfill your fantasy match. There is over a hundred different matches. You can create your created players entrance. There is probably 70 people on the roster. The ppv mode might be a little bit better it's pretty well the same. It has Hulk Hogan, Hollywood Hoagan, Hogan 80's, Andre The Giant, Bret Hart, British Bulldog, Stone Cold, The Rock, Mankind, The Junkyard Dog, and Ted Diabiase."
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is worth it i like it1)Buried alive matches2)more better bra and pantys match3)WAY SUPER BETTER GRAPHICSHEY i WANNA GO PLAY G.M modebut i think i am almost beating season mode and this is 3.3 hours i been playing it......ONLY!!!!!!!!! still WORTH IT
4,Its an okay game.,"Like most critics say. I believe in my mind that this is the best wrestling game that was ever made but no exactly the best in the statedment. Theres also troublesome especially when some things should & shouldn't have in this game. Like outdated wrestlers, The Rock(now that he sold out for movie crap), some unused matches(mainly FYF, PLB, & TLC), & other suches should not be in this game. But I Quit, Lumberjack, more created character slots, more features, today's wrestlers, & other stuff should of been in this game! But at least is moderate between good & bad! But its definately better than the first Smackdown! vs Raw, NOW THAT IS A BAD GAME & AN UPSET TO THE GENERATION OF WWE!"
3,The divas should have a right to play matches such as men,People who created smackdown vs. raw 2006! is horrible! the old games the divas can play most matches! now they can't play anyting! it doens't have to be realistic! for example girls can play hardcore or ladder or even 6-man tags! i know girls play six man tags! and only up to 4 girls at the ring! and the guys can have up to six! that ain't fair! I am a fan of the divas if there wasn't any i probably wouldn't play this game! in case you were wondering there are seven girls in this game! THey are1.Trish stratus2.Lita3.Torrie wilson4.Stacy Keibler5.Christy Hemme6.Joy Giovanni7.Michelle MccoolI think that Thq should improve and hope the next game they let these divas play in any mathes!
5,Greatest WWE Game Yet!,"This game is the best WWE game out there right now. The new season mode allows you to play two consecutive seasons without repeating the first season. Another new feature is the GM Mode. You can run your own show, pick what matches you want to have, and compete with the other show for ratings. The game also includes new matches such as: Buried Alive Match, Fulfill your fantasy, and Bar Room Brawls. One disappointing thing is that they don't have an Inferno Match. The most important part of the game is the selection of wrestlers. They include most of the last Smackdown! vs. RAW wrestlers except Matt Hardy, The Dudleys, and Rico. The new wrestlers in this game are: Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Jimmy Hart, Bret Hart, Andre the Giant, British Bulldog, Eugene, William Regal, Christy Hemme, Lita, Michelle McCool, and more. Overall, this is the best WWE game so far!"
2,I don't like it,"It's no secret that I'm no fan of new WWE wrestling games. I hate the fact that every new game only brings a couple new options. Meanwhile, the rest of the game is EXACTLY the same as last years WWE game. It's just a rip-off marketing strategy, in my opinion.At least this game has some wonderful graphics to make up for the lack of interesting new features. But the thing is, you don't need this game. Not just because there's already a million WWE games on the market that are all designed only to impress graphically-obsessed video game fans, but also because...The Playstation 3 happens to be responsible for the next generation of WWE games, and these games happen to have the best graphics to date. So, if you like graphics (and I know you do) just wait for the Playstation 3 wrestling games. Then after you purchase them, you won't care about Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 anymore *rolls eyes*."
4,GAME IS ON THE ROCKS.,"THE GAME PLAY ROCKS.GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME AND THE GAME IS INTERACTIVE.THE WRESTLER ARTRIBUTES ARE GOOD AND THE GAME HAS GOT IMPROVISED ON ITS REALITY AS IT HAS MORE STAGES OF BLOOD AND A FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE LOCKER ETC.IT HAS A REALISTIC MOMENTUM SYSTEM ALL COMBINE TO TURN THE SERIES FROM ITS ARCADE ROOTS TOWARDS THAT OF A SIMULATION.THE FURTHER ADDITIONS TO THE GAME INCLUDE A MORE ROBUST ONLINE MODE ,IMPROVISED CHARACTER MODELS AND FACIAL ANIMATIONS, A STREAMLINED CHARACTER CREATION MODE AND MORE INTERACTIVE BACKGROUNDS.DEVELOPED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE PS2 WITH USB LINK FEATURES TO ITS PSP COUNTERPART.IT IS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY."
2,This game SUCKS!!!,"You can't do anything! Season is the same stupid thing again, again, and again! The only thing differnt from Smackdown VS Raw is that Smackdown and Raw have two different stories. The commercial is a fake! John Cena had a baseball jersey, wearing the belt in his shoulders. Also the crowd didn't look like paper. In the game, Cena wears a football jersey and doesn't have another costume. The crowd looks like cheap paper. The only fun part was creating your character. Overall, this game is bull. Don't waste your money on it."
1,HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS GAME IS REALLY HARD AND STUPID. I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT GETTING IT BECAUSE OF THE NEW WRESTLERS. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE WWE SHUT YOUR MOUTH. BUT THIS GAME IS HARD AND STUPID. I DON`T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BLOCK AND HOW YOU DO THE FINISHING MOVE.I`M SO GLAD I RENTED THIS FROM BLOCKBUSTER. AND I CAN`T BELIEVE ALL YOU REVIEWERS FIND THIS GAME EASY AND FUN. CAN ANY OF YOU WRITE A REVIEW TELLING ME WHAT BUTTON DO I PRESS TO BLOCK AND DO THE FINISHING MOVE???????????????????????? I WOULD REALLY APPRIECIATED THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I submit--I've had enough!,"When you're as old as I am, I guess you shouldn't expect much from any game. But when you pay upwards of $60.00 for the game and the shipping and handling, you ought to get something that would keep you entertained. If that's what you think, you'd better buy another game. This game is as boring as the television shows it was aped after. Boring (not to mention extremely repetitive) storylines and simply unbelievable outcomes in matches. This game might keep 7-10 year olds happy for about 20 minutes.Anyone expecting anything else will be sorely disappointed."
3,SvR 2006 is okay not the best.,"when I heard about this game from friends i thought it was going to be amazing. Then when I got it I wasn't to impessed with it. I don't really like the graphics in this game. I mean yeah it is fun.I just don't think it is the best. The season mode is always the same. The only good people in that game are Kurt Angle, Triple H, and Batista. So this game is not realy my favorite of all the SvR games.The one cool thing aout this game is when you can unlock and be The Rock, Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, Andre the giant, and Stone cold Steve Austin. Other than that this game is kind of boring."
2,could be a lot better,this game is very overrated. the online gaming is horrible. people cheat so easily online. the season mode is pretty bad. i wish you could have multiplayer season and multiple seasons like in the old smackdowns on ps1.
4,This Game Is Missing A Lot Of Rosters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like this game but this game is missing a lot of rosters. When the next wrestling game comes out i expect to see Bobby Lashley, The Boogeyman, MNM, Mark Henry, Finley, Kid Kash, Viscera, Val Venis, Trevor Murdoch Gregory Helms(without the hurricane suit), The Gymini, Tatanka, Road Warrior, Animal, Brian Kendrick, Funaki, Ken Kennedy, Paul Burchill, Matt Hardy, The Mexicools, Simon Dean, Goldust, The Spirit Squad, Lance Cade, Ashley, Mickie James, Candice Michelle, Victoria, Maria, Sharmell, Jillian Hall, Kristal, and all of the other rosters thats on this game.And i also expect other legends like Goldberg, Brock Lesnar, and others."
1,wondering the matches and new features,"1. burried alive 2. fullfill your fantasy 3.6,5,4 over the top battle royal 4.no bra and panties 5. improved harcore like you can hit him with a ring bell or a 2-4 with barbed wire wraped around it.you can not lower there skills to season like you could before so its a bit harder. you can wrestle in ecw or wrestlemania 19 arena. it does follow the draft and does still have ppv mode and you can create an entrance too well thanks for taking the time to read my reveiw."
5,Most comfortable,WOW I am suprised. VERY comfortable. Very stable shoe.I love them!!! They are very sexy. I live in clogs and this one is nice and tall and most important to me they are comfotable. I wear them a lot.
5,So cute!,"I have nothing but raves about these adorable shoes!They give me NO trouble at all walking, and they are different!I'm a real shoe-a-holic, and I love it when I can find cute, comfortable, shoes that aren't ""cookie cutters"" (the same shoe every brand makes).I have 4 different pairs of Naughty Monkey brand shoes and I love every one of them!"
4,Prequel to Taash and the Jesters,"Ms. McKenzie's Taash and the Jesters is one of my all-time favorite books. Somehow I had missed Kashka and was delighted to see it in my local library last year. We just finished reading both books out loud to the kids (7 and 10). The twin cousin jesters are great fun, and I'm glad to learn more about them.In general, I think Ms. McKenzie has wonderful ideas, but I didn't like Kashka as much as Taash and the Jesters. The plot in Kashka was a little too convoluted, and too much time was spent on side characters that weren't particularly interesting. Also, it's not an easy book to read out loud. Still, if you like Taash and the Jesters, you will probably want to read Kashka, and you might even want to reread it. I would recommend starting the series with Taash, and if you are interested go back to read Kashka and the Golden Band of Eddris (I haven't read that book yet, but I'm looking forward to it)."
2,A nice buy for $30,"This laptop bag is nicely padded to protect you computer and has space fpr small things like, discs etc. The bad thing is it doesn't have a strap, handle, ot anything so you are not able to carry it anywhere which is a major turndown.....buy something with a strap or handle otherwise you will never be able to bring your computer anywhere."
2,nice design...but too small!,"I have a palm IIIe in it and the fit is VERY tight. In order to close it I have to scoot the stylus over to the side of the pda and then I can barely zip it closed. Not enough room left over to even think about putting anything else in it. It also doesn't have as much protection as I had hoped, the sides are floppy and the neoprene is not all that thick. Overall, I'm very disappointed."
4,Great case... Excellent price!,"I use this case with my PalmIIIx. It has plenty of room, and is soft and cushiony. I find that I can even leave the flip cover on my IIIx with room to spare. The interior pockets are great, but I've found them to be a little too small. Credit cards fit snugly, but my business cards are too long. They fit OK vertically, though. I also really like the fact that the case opens vertically. It's easier to handle. I've had problems with other leather cases falling out of my pants' pocket when seated. The neoprene exterior of this case clings to the inside of my pocket. It's never fallen out by accident. The alarm set on high is loud enough to sound through the closed case. I really like this Incase Designs PDA case..."
3,This case BARELY fits the HP Jornada 430,This is the best looking non-leather case I've found but if you have a Jornada you'll have to stuff it in there. It should definitely be excluded from the Jornada accessory list.
3,Buyer Beware,"This case really only fits devices that are the same size as Palm Pilots. Palm devices that are slightly larger - like my Uniden - just don't fit. It is a very nice case, I just wish it fit or that the size was actually listed on the advertisment and I didn't have to cross my fingers until it got here - so much for crossing my fingers."
4,Erudite revisionism on a massive scale,"Henry Kamen, a well-known expert on Spanish history, gives us a new look at how the Spanish Empire was created and maintained. He makes a good case that Spain (particularly Castile) could not have kept this enterprise going without help. Influential people from other European nations had an interest -- particularly an economic interest -- in maintaining the Empire. They supplied much of the money through loans and most of the military personnel as well. Kamen assembles extensive supporting evidence for his revisionist theory. His description of the Empire as the first example of globalization is intriguing, though that globalization was of a different sort from what we see today. The more than five hundred pages of text may discourage non-academic readers. The book includes some fine color plates."
2,Not an entry-level history,"I agree that this book suffers from poor organization and an overwhelming avalanche of detail. Kamen often shifts from one continent to another with no transition at all, only an extra line between paragraphs. A paragraph that presents an argument about one century will use as evidence an example from 200 years and a continent away. I am a huge history buff and patiently plod through even the driest field, but I found his text exceedingly hard to follow.Perhaps Kamen is an iconoclast blasting away at received wisdom about the Spanish empire, but I lack the background to say what arguments he is overturning here. If you are looking for an overview or general history of Spain, this book is not what you're looking for. Maybe I will come back to it when I have read some other works in the field and have a better grasp of the basics."
2,A misleading title.,"This book was not exactly what I was looking for, and not what I expected after reading about it on Amazon. The author seems to be more occupied with demonstrating how other peoples helped to create the Empire rather than telling the story of just how Spain raised itself so dramatically to world empire. I'd look elsewhere, as I am doing."
1,Another piece of Anglo-Saxon Protestant propaganda passed off as objective analysis,"Very disappointing; Mr. Kamen is another undercover Anglophile propagating Anti-Spanish and Anti-Catholic views fabricated by the English and other Protestant Europeans since the 1600s. His attempt to re-write history from an Anglo-Saxon perspective is nothing new to me. I have seen this type of stealth propaganda infecting my history books in high school and college. The argument that the Spanish Empire was not built by Spaniards is completely ridiculous and unfounded (another of numerous attempts to expunge all credit to the Spaniards)! Mr. Kamen will probably conjure up in his next book, that the Romans did not speak Latin but English and the Roman Emperor was the Queen Elizabeth with a bad hairdo!"
4,Heavy item.,Heavy cast iron.Evenly heat.There are no removable steel handles as product Features .Work great for my pizzas and other dishes. Like it.
3,Not really professional,"This DVD seems somewhat homemade. Very short movie pieces, a lot of bad graphics and required navigating in-between. Of course the stuff makes sense (All these training videos sound good). I have yet to finish watching it and see if anyhting good comes out of it..."
3,Pewter Silver Tone...,"well, now I know what that looks like - and I probably won't purchase anymore. Just not my thing. I purchased this for a graduation gift for a high school young lady - but found it just looked too inexpensive. Okay for what I paid I suppose, but disappointed not to be able to present it to a friend."
3,A good book that shows basic strikes and stances.,Phoenix-Eye Fist is a good book showing the basic strikes and stances of that system. It is filled with pictures to follow along with. The experienced martial artist may want a little more as far as the self defence goes. But don't get me wrong basics are everything! I am glad to have it in my library.
5,Switched review,Loved the movie. Very funny and sweet at the same time I would watch it over and over if I didn't have cable.
4,Funny,I love Jason Bateman. This movie had me laughing so hard. I've seen it a few times and I laugh every time. :)
2,Non-traditionally traditional romcom,"I thought this was going to be a movie about a woman making a choice to be a single mother. I thought it would be from her perspective -- the difficulty in making such a choice, the coming-to-terms with her singlehood, the joy of becoming a mother, finding friends along the way. Instead it was a movie from her best (male) friend's perspective, about how he thought it was a nuts idea, but because he had (secretly romantic) feelings about her, he would support his 'best friend' no matter what. In the end, it was not at all about her choice to pursue motherhood, it was about how best friends finally get around to speaking clearly with each other about their feelings, fall in love, and get married. Only to conventionally live in a nice, large suburban house while entertaining a group of 8 year olds at their son's birthday party. What was the hoopla and controversy all about anyway? It ultimately said that the traditional way - marriage - is the best way after all."
4,fuzzy warm loving movie,I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed the cast. This movie had humour and romance. Great ending.
1,Not good at all,I think this would be Jennifer's worst movie that she played in. This movie was not funny at all. It dragged and dragged. I want my 2 hours back and money back....lolDon't waste your money people...it's really not worth it.
1,Switch It Off!,"Bateman's character insists he's ""neurotic"" and anti-social, but he seems like Jason Bateman to me, nice enough but non-descript. I like him, but really: has Jason Bateman EVER acted? He's always just Jason Bateman saying things.As for Rachel, don't worry: the ""Friends"" reunion show can't be too far off.And, ladies and gentlemen: Jeff Goldblum!I guess what I'm trying to say is, why act at all when you're obviously boring yourself? Take a risk, Jason! Take a class, Jennifer! And Jeff...just take a hike.Pouring out an improbably-placed jar of semen that's just sitting on a shelf and replenishing it with your own while too drunk to remember doing it...well, gents, we all know how this would really go. ""Shooting pool with rope"" too subtle for ya?Flat, predictable, no characters, no writing, very little acting with way too much disbelief needing suspension. I'd say this is a ""chick flick"", but that would be mean to chicks."
4,Perfect fare for a long flight,Downloaded this movie to watch on a flight from Dallas to San Jose. It is sweet and an easy watch.
5,A favorite,I have always enjoyed watching Jennifer Aniston in any movie she has ever been in. She is truely a beautiful woman. Jason Bateman has been a favorite of mine sine the TV show The Hogan Family.
4,Pretty typical chick flick,I watched this with my wife and it was entertaining but not my favorite movie. Definitely geared towards the female crowd.
2,"Uh, ok?","The movie was pretty interesting until the the couple reunited. The son's role was very annoying and not a ""cute"" look for a child, nor his mother. A neurotic child does not make for a funny movie. The premise of the switch was not very believeable either. The movie was just ok. I wouldn't want to watch it twice."
2,Execrable,"I am predisposed to liking movies starring either Jennifer Aniston or Jason Bateman. This should have been an automatic win for me.This is an execrable movie. Painful to watch, and difficult to even want to care about the characters. Save your money."
1,The only likable actors are the kid and Juliette Lewis,"The main actors, except for Juliette Lewis and the kid seemed to be sleepwalking through the film. I didn't like any of them, and saw Jeff Goldblum Jason Bateman, and Jennifer Anniston as superficial, hollow characters. Anniston doesn't seem believable as this child's mother because of the way she acts with him.Compare this to ""Definitely, Maybe"" and you will notice the enormous difference between the charm, great direction, and great acting of that film to this soulless waste of time."
1,Not one of her better movies.,"This was not a very good movie. I tried to watch it, but after 10 minutes I had to turn it off. I am glad I did not buy it."
3,Interesting and less fluffy than expected,"The movie was fairly well put together and the acting is good. It was less of a comedy than I expected, but there are a lot of funny scenes and touching moments. Overall I enjoyed the ride but the movie ""felt"" somewhat flat. Enjoyable if you can rent it for cheap but not worth buying."
4,Much better than expected,I watched this as a concession to my girlfriend. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is good and Aniston is really a very good actress.
5,Funny,"Love Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston. Together, they're hysterical. He plays the neurotic/hypochondriac so well. It's a very entertaining, fun movie."
3,Mildly entertaining,"Unfortunately, its hard to connect with these characters as the actors really don't have any chemistry between them. Bateman's character is on the annoying side and grates on you through much of the film and, although I really like Aniston, the movie itself doesn't allow her to do much. The little boy is probably the best actor through this - It's too bad they couldn't have used him more. Some mindless entertainment on a rainy day. It's just 'ok'."
4,The Switch,I liked the story . It was funny. Good ending to it. I would tell people to watch it.Very good acting with Jennifer Aniston and Jason Batmen
4,A real feel good movie and a great NYC movie,I love NYC. I love Jason Bateman and I love Jeff Goldblum. This is a sweet romantic comedy with some really funny moments. It's a quiet little movie that warms your heart and it's just the right movie for a quiet night at home. It's one of the only Jennifer Aniston films that I liked her in. And the kid in this movie is really great.
3,Feel good and watchable,"A predictable, feel-good, chick flick is what this movie is. In-depth, heart-felt, moving is what it is not. It passes soem time on a Sunday afternoon and is perfect to do the ironing in front of, eat dinner or even hold a light conversation to. The storyline is clear before the opening credits start, but the characters are likable, and i didnt want to use the dvd as a frisbee, so it ranks higher than some other rubbish i have seen recently."
3,switch,"it's a funny movie. I like that i got a free copy online to watch on Amazon instand, its included with the dvd purchase. Its way cheapier to buy online than stores"
3,switch,"i would have liked it a lot better if it had,had closed caption for the hard of hearing otherthan that it was decent"
5,Great movie,I love this movie! Jason and Jennifer are so good and the kid is soo cute :)I laughed a lot. The actors are great and the story is awesome.
3,"Somewhat believeable, but then .....","This seemed almost credible until the climactic scene where the first sperm donor tries to propose, only to be interrupted by the real donor. I thought that was a bit lacking in realism. But hey, this is a movie, and a Jennifer Anniston movie, at that. This is about the 17th film that seems to revolve around Anniston's real life situation, i.e., perpetually in search of love and/or a child as she seems to creep into middle age. Screenwriters must be falling over themselves to custom craft these flicks so they can cash in. As usual with little kids in movies, the one here is a bit too saccharine for my taste. The ending, of course, is extremely feel good. This is a harmless piece of piffle. Go ahead and knock yourself out."
3,I liked Jason Bateman and the little boy together,"The first part of the movie really dragged for me. Mainly because Jennifer Aniston's character seemed really dreary to me. The whole ""schtick"" of the movie with the sperm exchange wasn't funny to me, but I really liked the result. The Jason Bateman character's relationship with his son really moved me. It's too bad it took so long to get there.That part of the movie would be a good family film but, unfortunately, the whole section with the sperm thing means I can't share it with my eleven year old until she gets older."
4,Not your average rom-com,"Though Jennifer Aniston gets top billing, this is really Jason Bateman's movie. He's the friend that wants to be more to Aniston. When she decides to have a baby on her own, he's disheartened to find out he's not on the list of potential ""donors"". Through a drunken mishap, Bateman is forced to replace the chosen doner's ""contribution"" with one of his own. Then Aniston moves away for several years. When she returns, Bateman realizes what happend while he was drunk, and that Aniston's son is really his. Meanwhile, Aniston has reconnected with the man she believes to be her child's father, and it starts getting serious, while Bateman's Wally gets closer to his son. Finally, as Aniston is about to get engaged to the wrong man, Wally comes clean. Aniston is furious. But after the passage of some time, she comes to realize that Wally really is the right man for her, and they finally become the family Wally had hoped for all along."
3,I can never look at Dian Sawyer in the same way,"Wally Mars (Jason Bateman) is in love with Kassie Larson (Jennifer Aniston) But he does not really know it. And the Kassie has more than friendship feelings for Wally but does not show it. Now Kassie wants a baby to beat the biological clock but not with her best friend Wally. So she chose a conception party where mutual friend Debbie (Juliette Lewis) introduces the"" Baster"" the original title of the movie from a short story. At the Party a drunken Wally performs the switch or the new title of the movie.The formula is common but the acting is pretty good. Excuse me if I do not go through the list of actors. However Thomas Robinson was exceptionally good as the offspring Sebastian; hope to see more of his acting in the future. Dian Sawyer may have a promising career also."
3,Full of laughs!,We bought it as a gift for our son to create a movie night basket gift! A bit raunchy but a fun movie.
3,Still waiting....,"So this is a cute movie about two best friends that happen to be of the opposite sex. Cassie (Jennifer) wants a baby and she wants it now! she asks her best friend Wally (Jason) to help her find a donor. Wally is a little narcotic along with being a hypochondriac and Cassie is, almost crazy in her search for a ""seed guy"". The whole movie I just kept waiting for something more. I'm still not sure what that something is but I feel like it over all it was a cute, heart warming, meant to be predictable movie."
2,don't even remember it,I'm coming back and doing a slew of reviews on things I purchased and I honestly only vaguely remember this movie. Not very memorable.
3,"2 1/2 stars - with Aniston and Bateman, could have been better","Yeah, well it's a bit of a disappointment. Really, there's nothing new here. The film is essentially a romantic comedy, with one gorgeous female (Jennifer Aniston) and one good looking guy (Jason Bateman) locked in a 12 year non-romantic affair when in fact they were made for each other. Unfortunately only the audience can see this and of course, predict the ending. The twist involves the switching of sperm used to induce pregnancy for our child starved heroine. Jeff Goldblum is the best thing in this movie, although I did like the kid too. Unfortunately the film is ultimately frustrating as the writer and directors painfully withhold the conversation that would have solved all the issues half way through the film.The nice Blu ray transfer is accompanied by several extras including deleted scenes, bloopers, an alternate ending and a featurette."
4,Enjoyable,"My wife and I sat down and watched this and we rather enjoyed it. We really like Jason Bateman, and both Jennifer Anniston and Jeff Goldbloom were enjoyable in this as well. This movie is funny and enjoyable, and of course a little touching as well. I would recommend checking it out! :-)"
3,Another Jennifer outing,"I love Jennifer Aniston so I see or buy her films religiously. I have to confess that I have been disappointed more than rewarded for my loyalty. In general her films have not delivered and this film is no exception. It tells the story of an average woman who does what is inconceivable a century ago but is accepted today: decide to have a family by artificial means, sidestepping the whole concept of a traditional marriage. She coldly and cynically picks the 'right donor' only to have someone less attractive as a sperm donor but with emotional ties to her substitute his 'sample' for the other man. The ending brings a modicum of justice as the person most devoted to her wins the 'race' to have his genes contribute to this artificially created child. It is a plot and scenario only believable today. Overall, it is a rather flat outing with a 'surprise' which would only surprise the most naive of filmgoers."
4,The Switch,I enjoyed it because it was so funny. They kept getting in their own way. Can't see the forest for the trees!
5,The Switch.,I love Jason Bateman. So I knew this would be funny. I've wanted to see it for a long time. Sort of a movie buff.
4,Good flick,"This movie is a good family movie. It's entertaining, funny & has its dramatic moments between characters. I would watch it again!"
3,The Switch,I really like Jennifer Aniston but I didn't especially like this because it leaned to more sexual contents than I like
4,Funny without the cheese,Jen & Jason are a great comedy combo... and the kid makes the flick! The script lacks the cheese factor that usually drags Aniston movies down. Loved this one!
3,A good movie to see,"""The Switch"" was a rather entertaining movie with a theme never seen before in a motion picture. It might be classified as a ""chick-flick"" but I found it very entertaining throughout and I think most guys will like it. The acting was good and I like both Jason Batemen and Jennifer Aniston. I would recommend this film."
5,Try watching it...its so good!,"After watching this movie in theaters, I was so confused on how/why it didn't make more money...it was so good! The boy is adorable, and it was an interesting new idea, and well acted!Try watching it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,The Switch,Excellent service to receive this DVD The Switch was a very good movie a nice family movie however first explained to your children about the facts of life? I feel possibly 16 to 17 yr olds should be an ok age to see this movie!
2,I really wanted to....,"Like this movie. But after the ""party"" I couldn't wait to find out what happened next only to be greatly disappointed. The rest of the movie wasn't really funny, and was predictable and reminded me too much of the back up plan even though they had different story lines. I usually like aniston and bateman but this movie just wasn't good. I couldn't wait for it to end once the Aniston's character moved back to NYC which was 1/4 into the movie. Rent before you buy."
2,Switch,"This movie started out pretty cute, but I started losing interest after 30 minutes. It is a love story without any passion, excitement, it was not even that humorous."
2,Slow Going,"This movie was very slow going with a predictable plot line. Aniston portrays a career womanwho suddenly realizes that her biological clock is ticking and makes a decision to have a baby.Although she has a very close male friend (Bateman), she picks a sperm donor (Patrick Wilson) fromCraigs List ads. Why would Bateman not offer his sperm in the first place is beyond me? But,later on he switches his sperm with the actual donor's sperm while drunk. That is another contrivedsituation. How can anybody not remember something like that? If there is one funny thingyou take out with this movie, it should be Diana Sawyer! Really! :)If you like heart warming movies that deal with relationships, this could be a 3 star or a 4 starmovie. Acting, casting, directing, it is all good.If you like action/suspense/special effects stay away from this movie. I hope this review was helpfulto you.."
2,"Interesting Concept, but boring","It was interesting I liked the characters, even the kid was cute in a nerdy weird child kind of way. But the action was not as interesting. To say the least it was pretty broing."
4,clean show,"Nice clean show, good story content, glad I rented it, relaxing show, more of a chick flick, liked the actors, better to rent than buy."
3,Only mildly amusing,"After reading the product description, I expected this to be a good comedy. However, although it was a nice enough love story with the ending I wanted to see, it had only a few funny moments and nothing uproaringly laughable. May watch it again once more before I'm likely to pass it along to a friend; probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd already seen the movie before purchasing."
2,Rather watch something else,"Depressing. Maybe later in the movie it gets better, but I could not last that long. Would rather watch something else or just go to bed, which I did."
1,Streaming quality is terrible,I can't believe how bad the streaming is from such a big company. I never have this issue with Netflix or VUDU or syfy are all far superior. I will give it another try but I have no intention of extending my membership if the quality doe not improve. And please don't try to tell me it is my computer set up because I am able to stream just fine on other sites
5,Good movie,"I was somewhat hesitant to watch this movie, because I thought it was just going to be another chick flick. But my wife and I with some friends watched it, and we found that it was actually a really good movie. I would recommend watching this. It definitely had us cracking up a few times."
3,Preview made the movie look like it was going to be funny.,Movie look entertaining from the previews but it was boring. The plot was all over the place and the movie got a interesting towards the end. The jokes were not really funny and the plot seemed to have no point. The main characters lives were all over the place. The main characters were best friends but end up getting into a fight and not speaking for like 5 years. I thought that the movie would have made sense and that it was going to be funny. It was kinda lame and I am glad I watched it at home. I would not recommend this movie.
3,WEIRD,This movie is weirs which is something I am not a fan of but if you are a fan of weird stuff this is definitely the movie for you.
3,Good laugh,"This wasn't too bad. I would say its about average with other romcoms. The acting was well done, i thought it was better than Aniston's, Along Came Polly."
1,Symptomatic of Illness,"Indicator #1:Sadly, how stereotypic have New York movies become in their artificial world that the rest of country (except Hollywood) find them insanely incomprehensible. Again, we have just another sex-neurotic romantic comedy (How many ways can this tale be told?) of dysfunctional, if not just plain strange, relationship challenged adults behaving like incompetent pre-juveniles. And, as a self fulfilling prophecy, Aniston again not only plays her self in her usual robotic airhead fashion but she also produces this film representation of herself. The ""I Love NY"" movies give us further insight into how the money attracting greed of Wall Street etc., can show no other side to itself and knows no other audience.Indicator #2:The quality of a movie is inversely proportional to the number of songs needed to fill and bolster it's content. In this case 24."
5,Grown Folks Music,"This DVD brings back a lot of good memories from the 60s and 70s.The image and sound quality on the vast majority of the performancesis excellent, although a few are just fair.This is real finger-popping grown folks music, that will haveyou up singing and dancing after the first 2 minutes ---its well worth buying!"
1,old school soul party live,I bought this cd twice. Both times it would not play. I was disappointed because I really wanted to hear the songs.
4,Good Classic,Good Classic singing . This was a real old school party with all of the good old legends tearing the house down.
5,REAL TALENT! GREAT DVD!,"it is so nice to see real talent. people who could sing 30 plus years ago and they still haven't lost a beat. and the orchestra music is breathtaking....real old school style. everytime i have my friends over(they are all older than me)for a dinner party or just to hang out, they insist i put it on and i am more than happy to oblige. nobody wants it to end, it brings back alot of great memories for them. i just love great music, too young for memories(smile).i have to get more copies to give as gifts.this is definitly a must have."
5,old school for real!,Enjoyed this DVD. It takes you back when music was music. Shared with a friend and she enojoyed it so much I let her keep it and ordered another one!
5,A Real House Party,"I saw this program on PBS late one night. Knowing I had to get up early, I couldn't turn it off. Turn on the surround sound and you've got a real house party. Loved every song, just wished it was longer."
2,Too much audience and band,I think that I also could have enjoyed this dvd more with all the performances by the artists if they showed the artists. Too much showing audience singing (look at Wilbert Harts Delfonics). If I wanted to see that much audience participation at a concert I would have just thrown a house party if I wanted to see people other than the artists sing.
4,Deluxe Blues from a Fine Player,Rick is in fine form in this 1998 effort. I would consider this to be one of his best recordings as a solo performer. The guitar work is especially good andrefreshing to listen to. Some of the songs show Rick's jazzier side and are really well done. Very nice. Highly recommended.
5,Still alive and well,And to think I used to see him play regularly in a bar on Long Island named Ubies OTJ's (on the job) that was 35 yrs ago..He was great then and great now..Pat Ednie
2,Drum Machine? Oh Brother,"If that isn't a drum machine, then Mr. Derringer hired the blandest drummer alive for this album (how disappointing from an old pro like Rick). If you can get past the ""cardboard drumming"" the music's not too bad."
5,Dial-A-Ghost,"Imagine what your life would be like if your guardians were ghosts. Oliver is an honest orphan who finds out he has inherited a fortune. Oliver's sneaky cousin,Fulton, wants the fortune for himself. He hires ghosts to murder Oliver. Due to a mix-up Fulton receives friendly ghosts instead of the murdering ghosts. The Dial-A-Ghost agency realizes their mistake. This leads to a tragic mistake. In order to clear things up they send the murdering ghosts to Oliver's home.Eva Ibbotson develops characters wonderfully allowing the reader to view them as friends and enemies with the characters. Fulton, for example, who became my worst enemy for trying to murder shy Oliver. I did not want to put this book down to Ibbotson's ability to end chapters suspensfully. I recommend Dial-A-Ghost to people who appreciate friendship, loyalty, and an exciting plot.(...)"
2,Dial-a-Ghost was an okay book.,"When I looked at the cover of the book, I thought it looked interesting but also something someone younger than me would read. I agreed to read it because it was on the Young Adult Book List for my English class. Eva Ibbotson thought up a very clever storyline although it really isn't my kind of book. I would recommend this book only to young people who like reading about weird, not very frightening, ghost adventures."
5,THE BEST BOOK!!!!!!!,"This is a GREAT book. I recommend it for any readers from nine up! It's exciting and funny. I couldn't put it down! If you liked Harry Potter, you'll LOVE this! An interesting, funny and ironic twist at the end! It makes you wonder weither there IS life after death. A must-read!"
3,Shoes were too small,"Shoes are beautiful. However, i had to give them to a friend with smaller feet as they did not come close to fitting me (yes i ordered my size). Very narrow. They are so no true to your size. Might need to order a size bigger."
5,"Once A Day, Clear Skin!",Length:: 2:28 MinsThis is just a quick review I did for the Cilinique Men's Face Scrub. Works really well for me (even in different climates!)
1,This battery is horrible!!!,"Do NOT waste your money on this battery. I paid $127 and it doesn't work. When I bought it, it worked for about 2 weeks, then it would not charge past 25%. I contacted Amazon, and they replaced it with another right away. They were great about it, however, the second battery won't charge at all! I have 2 other batteries for my laptop. Both are official Toshiba batteries, and they charge just fine, so I know its a battery problem, not a laptop problem."
4,"Great, but unexpected.","While ""Lover the Lord Has Left Us..."" is a great album in itself, it isn't a worthy follow-up to Tiger & The Duke, which is an absolute masterpiece. There are quite a few stand-out tracks, which include ""The Heretic"", ""My Horse Must Lose"", and ""Horses in the Sky"", but none of the tracks scratch the surface of what Tiger pulled off.We can only pray that TSOAF will work on another album and make it a bit closer to Tiger & The Duke."
2,"no, this is not that album you are looking for","So I love matt embree. I normally loves everything he produces, anything off his MDB record label.,However, I cannot recommend this cd. Musically, it just isn't all there; the actual ""songs"" are few and far between. Do yourself a favor; if you liked the tiger and the Duke release, buy yourself a copy of the Apotheke release, or even better; the new Rx Bandits cd; then download the few good songs off this album off itunes."
2,"Lover, The Lord Has Left Us","If anyone remembers, Tiger and the Duke was a great ""experimental"" album from a bunch of Equal Vision bands (mediocre bands might I add). It showed great potential from a bunch of ""artists."" It had a prog-rock feel. The only complaint I personally had with Tiger was the interludes, which are annoying. Roughly a year later they relaunch their website and announce a new album. Music elitists excited for what may come next. About a month ago the album was leaked, the album was over hyped and everyone was disappointed (for the most part). There were 2 strong songs, though. Skullflower and My Horse Must Lose. It's sad to say Skullflower's beat was changed, ruining the song on hte final master. If you want the best Skullflower, download the demo. This album is a shame, it's no good. If you are into noise and beep sounds, buy this album."
2,Yeah You Liked Tiger and the Duke?,"Sucks for you because this album is garbage compared to T&D. Sure, the album has some merit (the outstanding vocal section, some of the quicker paced songs) but that's not saying much. The rest is ambient noise, and most of that is dull. The sanskrit chanting is completely out of place. Fans of the old TSOAF will be highly dissapointed. RIP the complex polyrhythms and pounding beats."
1,Important Notice:,"This album is mostly ""experimental"" and ""noize"".If you like that sort of thing then you've come to the right place. If you don't like that sort of thing then keep moving. I was eagerly awating this album on the strength of their previous single, which is a song that I've played over and over. Obviously based on my rating I am not into ""this sort of thing"".I have yet to hear anything close to as good as that song on this release. I highly recommend listening to extensive samples/excerpts before buying this.I don't care for The Mars Volta but they are similar and better. If you want to go all the way simply get At the Drive In.That said, ""The Heretic"" is a decent track but certainly not a hard rock song. Get it from iTunes for $.99. Get the last track ""There Can Be No Dispute..."" if you like wasting money."
4,"Different, that's for sure","This CD is strange. It is completely different than anything I've ever heard before, yet I find myself starting it over each time the final track ends.Lover, The Lord Has Left Us is nothing like The Tiger and the Duke, but somehow that makes it better. It wouldn't have been appropriate for this band to release a CD that sounded the same has their debut. There are a good deal of filler tracks that some reviewers will write off as ""noize.""Like they are the first band to use fillers?Pink Floyd anyone?The Mars Volta?What this band is doing has been done before, they just happen to be doing it their own way. I appreciate that about them.The only thing keeping this CD from getting 5 stars is the lack of CD jacket/booklet. I look forward to seeing the art, the thanks, the lyrics. It would've been nice to have a translation of the Sanskrit as well.Other than that, a great listen."
1,Total ripoff,They call this music?Atonal. Impossible for me to listen to.I guess I should have researched it more.
2,The Law of Diminishing Returns,"I bought this candle around Christmastime, and when I got it, it seemed like a nice pine scent. Pine is the predominant note, but to make it ""sparkle"" Yankee has added some sort of sweet note, which is a little bit odd. This is one of those scents that the more I smell of it, the less I like it. The sweet note just doesn't go with pine, and it's getting really tiresome, really fast. Unfortunately I bought the large housewarmer. I'd recommend others considering this scent start with the tart or the votive. If you still like it when that's done, consider upgrading to the larger candle."
5,Bugs Bunny's Festival of Fun,"I bought this thinking it was a c-d when it arrived it was a VHS. I am sure it isOK but I did not send this video to my grand daughters for Christmas. I am sure itis good but wanting a cd it hasn't been played.G. White, Hardy, VA"
3,Italian Snow Helmet,"I cannot eat all the Italian snow that fits in this helmet. It's awsum, but sticky to wear later."
5,A Must Have Album,"Finally, after waiting for years, I have this album on CD !I have already have this album in cassete for years (more than 17 years as I can remember), I played this album very recently and I always enjoy the play by these four Japanese gentlemen.Their music is a unique Japanese Jazz (not a traditional Japanese music fyi), it is more like fusion jazz or jazz rock. As far as I know, I can not find this kind of music in western world. The Rippingtons maybe close enaugh to explain what kind of music that Casiopea plays, but it is quiet different. Casiopea plays more ""hard"" and have a very unique composition.This album was live recorded in 1985 in Japan, compiling their best tracks during those years. Since this album has been made in Japan, it is very hard to find in my country. Thanks a lot to Amazon & Caiman.com, finally I can have this !"
2,Do not get this for Devil's Express... Gang wars,"A nice collection of cheapo HK horror flix... real grade B, nah grade C movies... some I remember some I don't recall ever seeing... But I got this set to see one specific movie that was'nt on the this set and was mislabled on the box/disc itself [not any sellers fault]If you are looking for the '76 movie Devil's Express [also called Gang Wars] about an ancient demon in the NYC subways ... it is not in this sets [or solod seperately] Vol.3 .... The movie here is just called ""The Devils"" an entirely diffrent movie... so don't get it if you're looking for the Devil's Express/Gang Wars ..."
4,Nice Coordless drill,iI got a Chrome B&D anniversity 14 volt cordless drill. maybe 10 years ago and recently the original battery died an the drill gooes fine with the new battery
1,Battery has a 2 year warranty bought in Nov 2012 and is stamped with a 2011 date. Battery is old a purchase/,"Battery has a 2 year warranty, bought in Nov 2012 and is stamped with a 2011 date. Battery is old a purchase. Don't buy it."
2,Premature death,"After 2 years you better be prepared to buy expensive new batteries, because these babies will just die, and not only that, but they will take the charger along with them to the grave. Recommend getting another brand of cordless tool."
3,Better deal available...,"If you're looking to replace two batteries and a charger, as I was, don't buy them individually. Home Depot and Amazon both carry the Black & Decker CDC1440K-2. It's a complete drill set, but it comes with two 14.4V batteries, charger, carry bag, and small drill (good as a backup) for $59.99. Buying the two batteries and charger alone is more expensive than the whole drill kit, and you get another drill."
5,Works like it should,"It's a battery. It takes a charge, works as it should, finally loses charge and then you do it again. Good product."
2,Too much time on shelf,"They don't make these anymore, therefore, any one you buy is a shelved model. The one I bought must have been on the shelf for years. It holds a charge...barely. Should have just bought a new drill."
4,Anniversary battery tip,"Like many of you I could not find a silver colored replacement battery for my B & D chrome anniversary drill. I just ordered the standard HPB14 battery pack, which is black. Then I used a T10 Torx screwdriver (avail. at Sears, Ace, Home Depot, etc.) to remove the 4 screws under the case. Removing the 4 screws, the battery pack slips right out. Swap batteries and screw case together and you are done. No wiring, soldering, etc. Just lift and place. Now I have a (lame) backup battery for my drill as well. B&D should really make the anniversary battery pack, They must have sold a few of these drills."
3,Purchased Incorrect Batteries,"Although these batteries were listed as suitable for my Black & Decker Firestorm 14.4 V battery drill, they will not charge in my charger. My original batteries have three terminals and a heat sensor, which helps control fast charging. I now need to either purchase a new charger to suit my new batteries, or try to sell the batteries locally. Freight is too prohibitive to consider returning these units.Cheers Chris"
2,Take extreme caution,When you purchase this drill with battery and charger it says nothing about charging compared to the instructions that come with the replacement charger. If you run your battery down 0.6 volts below the stated 14.4 volts you will destroy the charger. Ni-Cad batteries can be cycled to prevent memory but don't attempt it with this charger.
5,Easy to use,"I bought this for precision measurements. It does just that. I use this in healthcare, as I need to measure EKG tracings for minute distances."
2,not quite what I remember,"When I was a teenager, yrs ago.... this was my fav! Not quite what I recall. Smells like an old perfume from my Aunts' collection on her mirrored tray on her bedroom dresser, that's been there a little too long."
1,Stay away from this game...,I've been playing this game for 2 years. It's riddled with bugs and Sony keeps making sweeping changes to the game instead of fixing the bugs. The latest sweeping change means that all my hard work put into attaining Jedi status was a complete waste of time. Sony didn't announce the changes until after they convinced many people to purchase their newly released expansion pack. This is one of the most deceitful tactics I seen a company practice to get money out of their subscribers. The game will soon be converted to a first person shooter for mindless hours of buttin mashing. I'd advise everyone to stay away from it.
1,Star Wars Galaxies: The Total Letdown,"I have only been playing the game for a short time, but I have quickly discovered the wasted potential of this game. The game is riddled with performance problems and server lag and especially extremely poor customer service for a subscription based game. Do yourself a favor, forget about this one and buy Battlefront II, you will be happier and save more money in the long run."
1,This Game Sucks,Dont buy this game they are so messed up right now.Go check out the forums of the game.
1,Too bad SOE does not care about its customers!,"You would think that a company would take into consideration the thoughts of its players. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the designers of the Star Wars Galaxies team (SOE= Sony Online Entertainment). They will charge you for expansions and then turn around and remove 80% of the professions that you have spent months developing. They do this with NO warning and will not refund money. They do not support the needs and desires of the playing customers. If there were ever an example needed of what not to do with your online customers, SOE could write the book."
1,"Not worth $15 a month, find a different MMORPG that is","Before November 15, 2005, Star Wars Galaxies was the most immmersive Star Wars game ever created, with a great community. Since SOE decided to completely revamp the game, and they've removed most of the things that made this game great. They removed their intricate and highly customizable 32 proffesion system and reduced it to 9 generic proffesions. They completely changed the combat system to a point and shoot system. It's hard to find people to group with to play the game now because so many people have cancelled their subscriptions. You won't find a lot of veterans helping new players, since most veterans have left SOE entirely and gone to play games from companies with much better customer support and respect, like Blizzard. Most of the things that made this game amazing have been removed, It's just too simple and generic now. Unless you're a very casual gamer, don't bother with Star Wars Galaxies. It's not worth $15 a month anymore."
1,Destroyed,"Used to be the most amazing game I had ever played. How the developers destroyed the game was heartbreaking. I'm now having fun with WoW, but just can't shake my nostalgia for the early days of SWG."
2,"Awesome graphics, terrible gameplay","As a life long Star Wars fan and a long time gamer I was excited about the possibility of ""living"" in the SW universe through a MMO. Unfortunately the bugs, poor game design and mismanagement by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) make SWG incredibly frustrating.If you want to gaze into some amazing graphics, visit the Lars homestead, see the palace of Theed, the abandoned Rebel base on Dantooine, then I say buy this game (and pay $15 per month for the experience). However if you're looking for good game play then stay as far away from SWG as you can."
2,Hard and Life eating game but fun with your friends,Let me first say that this is a great low price and now im gonna say that this is a huge game an enormus Galexy full of places to visit.BUT if you arnt willing to give up most of your life up to this game then your gonna stink at it when I got this game I played maybe once every todays and I kinda stunk at it.this game is confusing and LAGGY but i played with my friends that also had this game and there giving most of there life to this game they play maybe 5hours a day or more it was fun to hang out with them online but it got boring so I didnt play that much anymore so I quit sure my friends were sad but I didnt have to pay 15$ a Month so I saved money and my life so if your willing to give your life up to your Computer and Bow down before STAR WARS then go ahead butyou better have a good computer because it does LaggMAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
4,Been playing since day 1,"I have been playing this game since day 1 and have purchased Jump to light speed and Rage of the Wookies. Be advised that there are many people who like/love this game and are very happy with the new combat upgrade. It was a big change that took some time getting used to, but now that I have been playing on it for a while, I have to say that I like it much better than the old system. I am also a fan of the new combat icons. The game promotes hunting in large groups, but one is still able to do solo missions if they choose. Most of the bugs that I noticed have been worked out by now. If you are considering this game I would suggest checking out the forums on gamespot to get more player opinions."
4,Best of the Best MMORPGs,"I have played every single online game since the Alpha test of Ultima Online. I can tell you that SWG is the best of all of them. I have played SWG since it launched and now more than ever it is user friendly and a BLAST to play.Sure, there are lots of Jedi running around and the game is now level based instead of skill based. However, the only people who hate the game now are the ones who can no longer PWN everyone and everything in the game with 3 hits. The UBER ELITE players are now level 80 like everyone else. Deal with it, you whiners.If you like Star Wars you will LOVE this game."
1,Not worth it,"Many people loved this game, but it is basically bug ridden and unplayable most of the time. When it first came out and there were beta testers, we knew we were beta testers for a while. We didnt expect to be beta testers for a full 2 years and then have the game completly change, have to beta test that one, and then when that one starts working, have them change it and beta test the thing fully again. I guess if you want the experiance of beta testing a game for a 15 dollar monthly fee and being a QA tester for a buggy game and having to pay on top of that, than this game is for you. If not, there are many other stable MMORPG's out there that will not have a complete overhaul 2 times within 6 months, and then be changed from a great MMORPG to a console game, shooter game with no real interesting story or characterization"
1,More Crushed Dreams,"Initially Star Wars Galaxies had real potential for establishing a unique identity in the MMO world. However, this opportunity has been squandered. The game is being converted to just another First Person Shooter."
1,SOE Hates Gamers,"In the name of corporate profit SOE has taken ""Star Wars Galaxies"" and turned it from an enjoyable adult level combat and economics simulation into a mindless game for children. SOE ignores the wishes of its customers and has driven out and destroyed the veteran player base of SWG as a matter of deliberate policy. I have never dealt with a company more dishonest and abusive to its customers than SOE. SWG is worthless garbage, I beg you not to waste your time and money on this game.Thanks,Robert Kruck"
1,You CANT access the game. Do NOT buy this if you are new.,"These items should be pulled from amazon.after September 15th, 2011 all new star wars galaxies account codes are no longer able to be used. The game is shutting down on the 15th of December and new players are no longer allowed to enter the game.If you buy this you will not be able to have access to what you paid for so unless you just want the box then you should not buy this.Repeat: No one who buys a new cd key for Star Wars Galaxies will be able to enter the game and any account who has not been active as of September 15th 2011 will NOT be able to reactivate and enter the game. Please be aware."
1,False Advertising,"You can read all the other terrible reviews on the page for the vanilla version of Star Wars Galaxies to get a good idea what is going on in the community. I wrote one myself. All I have to say here is that if your going to buy this package for this amount of money, then have to sacrifice fifteen dollars a month to play, you might as well know that your not getting what's advertised. The box implies that you can be pretty much anything in the Star Wars universe profession wise, and this is definately no longer true as of April 28, 2005.Unless your into paying for a buggy game with now generic combat and huge expanses of no population in-game, I wouldn't waste my money on this sham. SOE is perhaps the worst gaming company ever put into being, and their exploitation of a vulnerable Star Wars community is sickening, especially when they don't even deliver a percentage of what they advertise."
1,SWG Runied my childhood memory,I was 7 when I saw my first Star Wars movie Im 35 now and I wnated to play in the Star Wars universe. SOE shot my dreams into space junk and all I could do was cancel my account.Just read the many reviews and steer clear of this game.From the top down it has a funk of death. I give it 6 months to live.
1,Severe dissapointment,"This game has spiraled into oblivion from Day1 never living up to what it was meant to be. Avoid at all costs.The game was fun for a while, then progressively the devs dumbed the game down. Now from 32 profession and open ended gameplay there are now just 9 professions. Originally we were assured player crafted items would always be the best, then with the addition of exceptional and legendary weapons loots became the best. Loot enhancers were the only way to make great weapons, then with some great wizdom the Dev team killed crafting in one swoop with the NGE. Now stats don't matter on components, enhancers are all useless and everyone will have the same weapons with NO DECAY. Player economy will spiral down even further as you only have to buy 1 of each weapon for the life of your account. Vets are leaving and the game is turned into a glorified FPS with playschool style crafting."
1,Don't buy this game or any other SOE Game including Everquest or Everquest 2,"This game is run by Sony Online Enterainment, they have poor customer service, the game is bug riddled and these bugs will never get fixed.SOE will at a wim change the entire game play overnight, with changes that are not what the established player base want. They are planning to change the game on Nov 15th from an MMORPG to an MMOFPS style game. This is not an RPG style game any more it is set to be a FPS style game.The playerbase is outraged at the changes. The main reason, ONE DAY after they release an expansion that SOE charged 30 US Dollars for they announce the change from MMORPG to MMOFPS which in turn renders more than half of the content in the expansion useless."
1,It's being dumbed down,"This was a great game. I spent a lot of time playing it and did quests, visited Star Wars locals and saw Star Wars characters. I liked this game I really did, now they are going to dumb it all down in the name of ""playability"". No more class trainers and leveling up just got insanely easy. It looks like 90% of the game will be Jedi in about 6 months of this update. It's going to be boring and the game will lose much of what made it Star Wars."
3,Good game for the right person,"This game is great for the fact that there is a lot to do in the game, and that you can have just about any proffession, but from what I have felt about star wars games, this is not like an ordinary star wars game, yes it is set in the star wars universe, but this game is made up of diverse people, not all being die hard star wars fans, so if it bothers you that people are not die hard into role playing, this might not be the game for you.oh and the guy with the dell, high speed is not always high speed, check your bandwith www.2wire.com and also dell in not a strong computer they are just cheap, and have 45% of the market. strong computers are home builds with real motherboards, not those all components built on the motherboard pieces of crap that dell builds."
1,Not worth your time...,"Game has completly lost its direction, was once a great game, but now its total crap. Thanks SOE!"
1,SWG was the best and now is the worst.,"Guys, I know you must like Star Wars if you are here but please don't buy this game. This game had some of the most unique ideas and best game play I have ever seen even to this day. After 6 months of the game being out SOE decided to start making it worse. Now with the NGE it is a completely different game from what it started as and is not even a tenth of what it was. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!"
4,emulator,ok let me start off by saying this game is not dead there is an emulator so look up swgemu on google and you should find there site if you go to the section about installing the game it requires the disks so do not try to take it down
1,Not worth the time or money,"This game should be ""the ultimate"" game. But SOE's incompetent managment of it have turned it into nothing more than a piece of crap. They're policy of doing more with less and consolidating all their games so that they play the same and cut down on cost, have turned this game into Everquest with a Star Wars coat. To quote PC Gamer, ""SWG has lost it's uniqness"". Instead of this game been driven by the love of Star Wars, it is now driven by greed. SOE constantly pushes away fixes to problems and content in favor or putting out expansions that no one wants to milk the franchise.Stay Away from this"
1,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,"Word around the industry is that Sony will be ending Star Wars Galaxies soon so think very carefully before you buy it.What I do know for certain is that the servers are empty and no one is playing this game. Take a look at all the negative posts, the only people 5 starring this game work for Sony!Things look bad for the future of Star Wars Galaxies."
1,Run fast and far,"Run away from SOE products. Run fast and far. They have begun to take SWG down a path that is guaranteed to alienate their playerbase.I see a few people here making the ridiculous claim that everyone who is upset about the Combat Upgrade are exploiters or leet dewds. This is untrue. The majority of people upset are non-combatants of all kinds. Crafters, entertainers, doctors... In SWG if you're not a dual mastery combatant the devs are essentially saying that you don't matter.There have been plenty of reviews here that tell the truth about how deeply messed up the game has become because of SOE horrendous design policies. Do not be swayed by the occasional glowing review. The majority of SWG veterans detest the CU because the game used to be much better. It used to encourage different styles of gameplay and now it does not.If you enjoy mindless, endless grinding to no real end, then this game might be for you. If not, run fast and far. Put your money into anything but this game."
1,RIP SWG 4/26/05,"CU killed SWG. subscription numbers don't lie. the only people still playing are people who are riding out the remainder of their subscription periods, it's really that bad. i managed to overlook SOE's total bungling for a long long time, but the cu even did me (a hardcore star wars fan) in. very sad to see such a strong franchise like star wars that was once a promising mmo (swg) get absolutely devastated like this one was by those idiots at SOE.the swg we loved (even with it's quirks and total lack of help/support from the morons at SOE) has been totally demolished. f you soe."
1,swg? that ended 4/26/05,"what a joke! the cu killed this game. trust me, save your money. people who love mmos left a long time ago....the cu finally did in all those who love star wars and kept up hope that one day SOE would get their act together. but unfortunately they just ensured the death of swg. well hopefully some time in the future a competent company can do a good star wars mmo."
1,Ruined by development,"For 1.5 years this was an OK Game that needed some touchup... Then, over the past year, Developers have ruined everything that made it special.Now, until they roll back this is an embarassment"
1,Loved it but had to leave it,"This was by far, the best MMO I've ever played. Granted I came in after CU but still I loved it and was part of CIO, a DJO guild. But because of the NGE, had to leave. There is nothing left to it. It plays more now like Unreal Tournament on a global scale with much of the substance that made this game the most unique MMORPG out there what it was. Smugglers can no longer smuggle, you're forced down one path, no more custom templates, etc. Sorry, pre NGE I would have given it 5 stars but now it's not even worthy of the one I'm forced to give it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"Sony has changed the game dramatically. The game is no longer a MMORPG, but a MMOFPS. People are leaving in droves. Do not get on this sinking ship."
1,Don't waste your money on this game,I have played SWG for over a year and a half and I have a level 80 Jedi. The game is great in concept but it never reaches a point beyond a Beta game. SOE and LA have seen fit to totally alienate the player base with screw up after screw up. They avoid fixing bugs and keep pushing out new product. My recommendation for any one considering this game is to start looking at other games that are not SOE produced.If you do buy this game just expect that you will be let down time and time again with promises made and always broken by Sony Online Entertainment.By the way they just released a revamped version of the game that is so full of bugs you can not play it decently.
1,A Great Game Destroyed,"This was a great game. I stopped playing for a while (lack of time) and while I was gone they completely redesigned it. The end result is aweful. So bad that they actually included ""Are there any servers running the old system? - no."" as a question on their FAQ.Whoever led the redesign needs to be blackballed before they screw up any other games."
4,Give it a chance.,"Ok, so I played the game before the ""dreaded"" CU. After the upgrade I was furious and all but canceled my account. After 2 weeks I gave it one last try and stuck with it. It's better now than it ever was before the CU. Plus, non combat professions are popping up every where. I see them all the time and am tempted to convert to non combat. This game is at it's best and from what I've read, it's going to get better."
1,Dubious,"I confess I have not read this book but have read statements by the daughter, Sherry, who Amy Neustein claims was abused by her father. Sherry has stated that the alleged abuse never occurred and that this book is a pack of lies about her and her father. A Google search to find out more might be worthwhile before you consider buying this book."
1,Duplication,"There is no ""box set"" as advertised and this book is a duplication of ""Growing Orchids"" by the same authors, just a different cover."
1,"Legal Forms, Contracts, and Advice for Horse Owners","I purchased the book with the intent of being able to easily draft contracts for various types of horse owner activities. I was not pleased with the example contracts. The book is very poorly done.For example, the partnership agreement was missing words and apparently sentences,and was missing major partnership points. Essentially,I determined that the writer never read the agreement once in print or ever drafted a useable business partnership agreement.A beginning law student not knowing anything about the horse business could do a better job drafting the example agreements than the person who attempted to write this book."
4,So where's the software?,"I bought this book, which has been very helpful for the start of my new enterprise... but.. the front cover says Software Version... am i missing something??? There was no software with the book. Am I to order it or something?? Other than that., very useful book.."
2,On Cover-Valuable Legal Advice for Transportation Operators,"It shows on the cover that there is Valuable legal advice for Transportation Operators amoung Riders, horse owners and so on. So I bought this thinking I get some great forms and advice for when I hauled other peoples horses, or delivered horses I sold. Forget it - not one form for the TRANSPORTATION OPERATORS for hauling other peoples horses. They should remove that statement - it was the only reason I bought the book. I was very disappointed. Book is a good book if you have a breeding or boarding facility. So if your looking for advice and forms on hauling horses - DON'T LOOK HERE SAVE YOUR SELF SOME MONEY. ALSO beware - there was a contract for cleaning stalls, but nothing for the person who just wants to ride in your arena or use your facilities and not board. Even though it is a good book I only give it 2 stars for mis-representing itself."
2,Overpriced.,"For the price, I would have expected to get a CD with form templates. The paper forms alone are good guidelines, but really not as helpful as I would have expected."
4,Mostly Good But Could Be Better,"This does everything you want in a digital weather radio and more. It uses SAME technology so you can localize warnings county by county, and you can customize the alerts for visual only, or visual and sound. It is even useful as an alarm clock, so much that it now serves as my bedside clock/alarm.It is very easy to program in order to localize the weather warnings, but curiously, it is laborious to set the clock and alarm. It's not that it's hard, it just takes more steps than it needs.Also, the clock display is downright irritating in that it shows ""PM12:00"" as an example. The am/pm could definitely be smaller.All in all, I'm glad I bought it. I just think they could have made it better and easier to use if they had put a little more thought into it."
4,great radio...but,"has everything you want in a weather radio.. but the light is very dim in the display, and the contrast isn't good in the lcd, therefore it is diffcult to read...very difficult and cannot be adjusted."
4,The Best There Is,"It's the best there is, the only one ... with SAME ability (an absolute must), but could be better.I can't complain about the weather radio, but the attempt to be a clock radio is poorly conceived. You can barely read the clock and the settings are awkward. The clock lighting comes from a 20 year old technology."
2,Awful to use!,"I've had this weather/hazard monitor for about 6 months now and it has been so much of a pain that I am going to give it away or sell it. We get flash flood warnings at least once every few weeks at 1-3 in the morning (and we are in no likelihood of being affected by a flash flood). There is no way to set the unit to only alert you to certain threats - such as tornados, civil emergencies, etc. So, if you have your county (or counties) selected, you're going to hear it if ANY alert is issued. Sure, you could turn it off at night, but that defeats the purpose. Setting the unit up requires following the manual, as does just about any operation besides turning the weather radio on or off (the thing REALLY is tough to use - and I work in research and development). I hope to find another unit that will allow me to set what hazards I want to be alerted of."
4,Weather radio,Very good product. Directions simple and easy to follow. We get a lot of severe weather in our area of Ohio and this radio has helped to alert us to several situations.
4,Works great.,"Since I have received my 74-200 it has worked very well. I have to admit I haven't used the alarm clock feature yet so I can't comment on that but the S.A.M.E. feature works as advertised and the reception is good even at a long distance from a transmitter. It even displays a replace battery message when the 9 volt battery needs replaced. Have had no more annoying alarms for counties well beyond my area in the middle of the night. The manual could be a little less confusing. For the price, this radio can't be beat."
2,This album is okay,"LeToya's album is a decent R&B; female debut and yes she does have great personality compare to some artists lately but her sounds are really no different than what's already out there.Out of all the tracks in this CD the ones that stood out to me was ""What Love Can Do,"" Torn,"" and ""Obvious."" It's great she accomplished her solo album, but please people lets stop fooling our selves."
2,i gotta say this...,"letoya did her thing with ""Torn"" and ""She Don't"", but the other songs on the album fall short. Sure, she got some club bangers but so does everybody else. She does a voice but she doesn't seem to use it to it's full potential. There feels like there is something missing from this album. And no, I ain't saying this because I like Beyonce; hell, if letoya really puts her all into her next album, she could be a real contender, but for now, she's alright. Many of the people giving five stars are just doing that because they don't like beyonce."
2,"Not bad, but not the greatest...","It's not that she can't sing because she obviously can, it's just that I'm not impressed with her album. Some of the songs have some pretty neat beats, while others, no offense, sound like they are supposed to be on a Destiny's Child Album. There really isn't a good variety of music selection. The vocals aren't strong, I feel that a lot of singers today shy away when it comes to showing their talent, and there are some who do it because they are advised to while others do so because they really can't sing. Would I personally go out and buy the album, probably not. Would I recommend it to others? If you like the sound and don't mind listening to vocals that sound like backups then your fine. Now, I know that sounds harsh, but as I mentioned in the title it's ""not bad, but not the greatest""...."
2,BEEE for real....,"This may have been a good album, but lets be honest she is not a good singer, did you now hear her performance on BET???? Her backup singers she get her record sales...I was loving her w/ ""Torn"" till I heard her perform it and not only was my heart torn but so were my ears. Come on now I don't care what kinds of songs she comes out with she'll never be on the same level with ""B"" I'm sorry:)"
2,She is... OK,"I bought this CD expecting much more from her with all of the hype she was receiving! There are only four good tracks out of the fifteen listed( Torn, She Don't, All Eyes On Me feat. Paul Wall, and Obvious) Out of all of the collabos she did the only good one is Paul Wall. If you want to just support LeToya then buy her album but if you want good songs then find someone who has it and copy the four tracks listed above."
2,"Bland, blase and boring","I really wanted to like this album, but the material is just so-so and nothing memorable. Besides ""Torn"", the only other compelling tracks are ""Obvious"" and ""This Song"". Letoya is talented, but this CD failed to make an impression on me."
2,Le Sigh....I just don't get the hype,"OK, ""Torn"" is a somewhat acceptable lead single, but what were the producers thinking when they crafted this middling, forgettable album? I think everyone is so caught up in the DC hype, and the additional hype of this having debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100, that they forgot the basis of a good album - the MUSIC.Of which there is none to be found here. Granted, LeToya definitely sounds better than most R&B; vocalists out there today (her desperate need to emulate Mary J.Blige is a little obvious though), but the material lets her down. The song ""Obvious"" is a wonderful showcase for her vocal abilities but then the rest of the album drowns itself in the common references to pimps, ice and clubs. I am so tired of that whole thing, seriously.LeToya is a novelty item in the market right now, thats about it. Does anyone seem themselves playing this five years down the line? I think not.Mildly recommended."
5,For my niece,"I have never heard of this lady before my niece introduced me to the music. Not bad at all. If you like her, buy it."
4,"Soft, Sensual, Richly Textured, Control, MEANINGFUL!!!","This is the first cd since Ms. Houston's debut, that I can listen to without skipping tracks. Ballads, R&B;, Hip-Hop girlie style, even the Intro and Outro are relatable! Toya's voice is pure, calm, and inviting. She doesn't over-sing, she delivers track after track after track. LeToya is a well-written, well thought out project. Her lyrics leave nothing to be desired. Her singing style is NOT contrived, in other words forced. Toya is a born Soprano, charming, intelligent, articulate, and humble...qualities evidenced by her music and presentation.Standout Tracks are:!!!Intro !!!everything in between!!! Outro!!!Excellent debut effort. LeToya was well worth the wait.**** rating because Toya has potential to grow into a solid five star artist if she paces herself and stays focused and grounded in her faith."
2,dime a dozen,"her voice is decent,but nothing on this album stands out. in truth when i first heard some of the cuts&heard the name Latoya I was thinking about Latoya Jackson. it ain't that far-fetched because both when compared to being associated with a More Talented&Dominat person either in Family or in a Group both aren't in that league. Le Toya is a Sexy looking Chick,but a dime a dozen act. oh about 99 other chicks could have done about 60% of these tracks. she has some personality,but doesn't have any stand-out tracks here. not Badd,but far from making you think&feel Beyonce has something to worry about. this is just a Ok Debut."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"This CD is horrible!! I wish I could take it back to Best Buy, or have Letoya buy if back from me. I am glad I only paid $6.99, matter-of-fact Letoya can have it back. I only like one cut ""Torn"". I have played the CD over and over and, thinking maybe another song will grow on me, and it hasn't NOT ONE!! This CD SUCKs!!!!! If you want to hear it, I advise you NOT to spend your money, download it or buy it bootleg!!"
4,Good,"This is a good album of danceable tracks from the ""H-Town"". LeToya has a sweet high pitched voice that sounds great over the heavy club beats. It is a bit ghetto but not in a bad way. She has a lot of rappers as guest stars so if you don't like that, beware. Overall, it is a solid buy if you like this type of music. It is not grammy material, but who cares."
5,Better Than?,"Song for song, this CD is much better than any CD her old partner with all the notoriety has released. There are three strong 5-star songs on this CD with many other interesting songs to support this overall 5-star rating."
4,Good first solo project,"I bought the CD when it first came out. On a whole, I like the cd. However, I pretty tired of everyone sampling everyone's work and I would love to hear a ""solo album"" instead of an album full of guest singers/rappers. I was disappointed in LeToya's performance on 106 & Park but I think most of that was nerves and no longer being part of a group. I think she'll have a pretty successful future, if she continues w/vocal training, know & work within her vocal range and select songs that compliment her vocal range."
3,"Loved the slow joints, not so much on most of the fast ones...","Good album from LeToya. I'm happy to see her do her own thing. This girl can straight up sing and its a shame we never heard her and didn't know what kind of voice she had when she was with Destiny's Child. Slow songs about relationships are definitely her strong suit. Faves include ""U Got What I Need,"" the hits ""Torn"" and ""She Don't,"" ""Obvious,"" ""This Song,"" ""Hey Fella"" (w/ Slim Thug, a banger) and the ""Torn"" remix w/ Mike Jones & Rick Ross, which is ridiculous and should be released on the radio...Next time she'll hopefully not feel the need to be so so Houston oriented and can lessen up on the Houston cameos and crunk beats, where she comes off much less sincere and personal than she does on the slow jams. At least now she's definitely on the map as a legit solo artist, and I'm excited to see what she does next."
4,Surprisingly pleased....,Ok people...lets get one thing straight. LeToya is having success because of who she is for one. Being a former member of one of the most successful girl groups of the past decade gives you a leg up. She has obvious star quality. The album is decent and produced well. He vocal capabilities are NOT and I repeat are NOT astonishing. She can sing...Yes. She's pretty...yes. But she is no better than anyone who was...is...or will ever be a member of the formentioned girl group (Destiny's Child). She will go far as long as she keeps letting people know that DC is in her past...dont dwell on it.
4,So Good So far,"When I heard ""Torn"" on the radio, orginally I didnt know who the person was singing it. I didnt realize who it was until I was watching CD USA. I was so suprised when I found out it was her. I had been waiting on her CD to come out for so long til I just gave up. When I bought her CD I was satisfied. The wait was worth it. She had been through so much, when she finally decided to come out on her own and stamp her name on it, she had to make sure it was on point. And her CD, is."
4,Great Debut CD for Ms. LeToya!!,"Letoya's new cd is off the chain!! she is really showing her true side on this album. Not only is she a good solo artist, she's a very talented songwriter. Letoya is here to stay!!"
5,D Child was about more than Beyonce,"Buy this album!!!!! This was a very good album from one of the lost destinys child members. This album was at the top of the charts, and its not hard to figure out why. This album has an old school sound especially on tracks like u got what i need, she don't and torn. Overall this album is a definite must have."
2,Not Bad But Not Great,"I bought this cd thinking it was going to be a good album. It's okay. The songs on this album are song that any other r&b; singer would put out. People want to make the comparision to Beyonce, but there is none. Yeah yeah she was apart of the Best Group Ever, but Beyonce as a solo artist is different, edgy. Letoya has talent but i think that she should have come harder. I think that the reason people are feeling this album so much is because we really dont have no new r&b; singers that do it except Mary,B& Alicia. Nice try Letoya maybe next time you will come harder and more original.Best songs: So Special,Torn,She Don't,Hey Fella,This SongActual rating **1/2"
4,I SEE A REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR,"[LETOYA] LOOK'S,SOUND'S,MOVE'S & PERFORM'S SO MUCH LIKE THE GREAT{AALIYAH} IT IS SCARY.SINCE THE WORLD LOST AALIYAH IN THE SUMMER OF 2001.I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A ARTIST THAT WOULD MATCH AALIYAH'S TALENT AND COULD NOT FIND ONE.THAT WAS UNTIL I DISCOVERED THIS CD & WATCHED LETOYA VIDEO'S AND IT BROUGHT BACK GREAT MEMORIES OF THE GREAT AALIYAH.NO ONE WILL EVER TAKE THE PLACE OF AALIYAH BUT LETOYA CD MAKES ME REMEMBER THE SOUND,LOOK & STYLE THAT MIGHT BE IF AALIYAH WAS STILL WITH US.I SAY GOOD~JOB LETOYA AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK;AND AS ALWAYS[R.I.P]:TO THE GREAT AALIYAH (ROME,NEW YORK)"
2,Not that good,"Let me first say that I was thrilled that Letoya came back. I got her CD because I wanted to show my support and I was hoping for something that would just blow me away. Unfortunately, this is not the CD. I already knew that ""Torn"" was a song with elementary type lyrics but they play it so much on the radio, I started to like it. Basically, the whole CD has that type of lyrics. The lyrics are not all that and the beat is ok, nothing catchy or something to consider ""the beat"". So, I bought the CD for 9.99 and turned it in to get 4 dollars which I was glad to get something, it beats nothing. And plus, I didn't want the CD cluttering up my car if I wasn't going to listen to it.And another thing, just look at the price Amazon is offering for it (7.99) and the price of the used CD starting off at 3 bucks. That says it all. If it was all that, the price would not be set that low."
3,OK...not great,"This album was ok...I bought it because I like her first 2 singles. I dont think it appeals to a WIDE range of people....Toya's lyrics are ""too street"" Everyone cant relate to thugs and candy paint... Also, there was no creativity in writing. Very teenaged choice of words; repeatitive words as well. Its not a waste of money...but buy it only on sale"
3,I'm Torn about this LP,"I was hoping for more...the production of this album is really all over the place. Most of the beats are rather wack. I found myself skipping tracks midway through the song simply because the beat was annoying. Ie ""All Eyes On Me"" and ""Gangsta Grillz"" the blend of the track and vocals didn't seem to be laid right. There are a few good tracks ""She Don't"" ""I'm Good"" ""U got What I need"" of course ""Torn"". Over all its an okay first release."
3,It's not bad,"It's a good album but not all that. To me it starts off kinda slow and sunny then mid-way gets dark and hella crunk, but then all the crunk fizzes out and you get a batch of bland boring ballads w/ an un-necessary remix of ""Torn"" But at her best this solo star really shines check out the poignant,well written ""What Love Can Do"" which boasts her best vocal performance. ""All Eyes On Me"" is fire but Paul Wall makes it hotter.The album could've been so much better but still needs some re-working arrangements, the sounds though are very 70's soul influenced seemed messed up in some parts, especially cause LeToya's voice fades as the samples go stronger.We'll see if she can maintain to stands on her own."
4,Solid Debut,"This is a wonderful debut by the talented LeToya. I was a fan of her's when she was with Destiny's Child and I was sad to see her leave. Her return to the music scene is very refreshing. Every song on her self-titled debut is solid and has great potential to be a radio hit. There are no fillers on this cd. Some of the highlights are ""U Got What I Need"", ""Torn"", ""What Love Can Do"", ""She Don't"", ""Tear Da Club Up"", ""All Eyes On Me"", ""Gangsta Grillz"", and ""I'm Good"". This is a great mixture of R&B ballads and Hip-Hop edge. I was very surprised that I liked this cd. Already I'm addicted to it and I never had to skip over a song. This album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Charts on her very first week. LeToya deserves all the success. I highly recommend that you purchase this cd. You won't regret it."
5,Letoya,"I love this CD. It is tight. This album is the best way to reintroduce herself to the world. This album is a quality mix of musical sounds and styles.She took the whole Screwed Up style and used it for an R&B; record like this one ""Gangsta Grill"". This album will put Houston on the music map. This album has been certified Platinum."
4,review,"First I have to say that the cd is fire, and I always was into her way before Beyonce took my eyes. I do have to admit that i burned the cd a while before it came out. What suprised it was the songs that didnt make it to the final product which were really good, and more up tempo. But there are a couple of songs on this cd that I havent heard though. Her next video should have been Grills. My favorite on her cd. Maybe that will be her next music video though. I heard that the other member Latavia is trying to do a music project now. Letoya is very real. She is who she is. True, she dont sing that well live, but cd is fire though.A few other tracks she dont not have on her CD are1. Im a Queen2. No More3. Tear the club up feat Bun B (club banger)Think a few more tracks, cant think of them though"
4,Pretty Descent CD,"I liked the CD. I don't play it often, but I did enjoy it. I hate the track with her and Paul Wall and was looking for the Torn remix that featured Slim Thug...but maybe that was only for the radio stations here in Houston.Anyhow, one can't help but to compare her CD to the old DC sound. Yes, I think Toya has a pretty voice, but she can't hold her notes long. That could be attributed to the fact that she hasn't sang in a while...who knows?I think anyone who buys the CD will be pleased. Hopefully she can maintain in the industry and people won't keep comparing her to Beyonce."
2,a better fitting title would be: herbs and their drug uses,"I have not really deep-read this book. I got it. I am working with herbs at every steo of my life, food, magic, charms, tea and cosmetics. This book - surprisingly - focusses less on magical uses or rituals even though some pointers are given but instead tells you on how to achieve trance and how they are useful as drugs ind the phychaldelic sense. NOT my cup of tea. NOthing I would subscribe to. So while it may be a good book for somebody looking for crutches in magical life too, sigh, it was NOT what I was looking for"
4,Good,"A different way to look World War II. It starts slow, but cruel at the same time. Got my attention. Not the best documentary I've ever seen, but a good one."
4,If it was only on Blu-Ray...,"Amazing footage as best as could be reconstructed, I suppose from nearly 70 years ago...It appears that following the 12/7/1941 after the incident at Pearl Harbor the U.S. could not ignore the World War II anymore and they had to get actively involved, so they erected the 8th Air Force Division if I'm not mistaken and from 7 pilots and zero planes they built a massive B-17 Flying Fortress (also B-24. & B-29) and P51-Mustangs for dogfights (air to air battles) fleet (the word Armada comes to mind). 26,000 lives were lost in both the European arena and the Pacific theater of war from the U.S. fleet... (more than twice the number of mobile infantry in the ground of both Utah beach and Omaha beach - Operation Overlord - The Allied invasion to Normandy)."
1,my worst dvd value ever!,wasn't expecting any more from this than hopefully some previously unseen (by me) footage. start. what the heck?! the aircraft all seem elongated and vertically compressed to the extent that it was bothersome. i slogged on figuring the distorted images would clear up. they didn't. complete bollocks. from beginning to end. i threw away the disc & kept the dvd case as a spare.don't waste your $$$. not even worth renting for a dollar.and no i wasn't using the wrong picture mode. my sony bravia has 4 pic modes. the only one i ever use is normal. no distortion mode.
2,Who? What ? Where? Why am I watching a guy in his living room?,"That is how i felt while watching this seemingly Hollywood movie style ""documentary"". The topic and picture of what you are watching switches around so much that you had better drink extra coffee to be able to pay attention to SOME of the nice footage in colour..but the rest of the time you might be watching some guy sitting in his living room talking about HIS personal expierience. although some of the the actual colour footage is interesting..you have Hollywood style enhancement of it..with movie style music in the background. etc.one might think they are actually watching a Hollywood movie instead of a documentary. shame."
4,P51's rule!,"Very informative movie, plenty of action, mixed with good commentary. I can't imagine what fortitude it took to participate in the air wars late in the war. Also, what an impact the P51's had! If you like WWII history and especially air battles, this is the movie to watch."
2,Great for Kids,"To all readers: Please be advised that this is a kids book for someone in the age group of 10 to 13. Needless to say as an adult, it is a very, very quick read and you probably already know most of the story if you were alive when it happened."
2,A short story,"Kantar has authored a brief summary of the Edmund Fitzgerald story. I was expecting a novel length work, not a 41 page synopsis of the available literature. The book is more suitable for children. Not worth the asking price."
3,Chickpea flour,I need to educate myself on more variety of uses for this product. I like it but don't use it much.
1,Delusions of grandeur...,"This is a badly written book by two people who are apparently proud of stabbing a naive executive in the back instead of attempting to rally the staff to solve his problems. They rationalize their actions as necessary to ""save"" Java and paint themselves as adept politicians whose inspiration is Lawrence of Arabia. Benedict Arnold would be a more accurate portrayal.I know many of the people in this book on a first name basis and I can tell you that the idea that these two saved Java is utter nonsense."
1,Java--the Inside Scoop from the Personnel Dept.,"A poorly written, self-serving saga starring a human resources employee with visions of Arabia (and of getting on the glory train of Java) and a bit player at the outer edge of the technology, whose exaggerated roles are not supported by the more carefully written histories or accounts of the project. It is primarily useful in showing the corrosive effect of the Silicon Valley ""success"" machine on those who live there but can only watch from the edge."
1,"Beyond amateur, typo-ridden, brutal grammar, repetitive.","This book is just laughable. From the laser-writtem typograhpy to the spelling and grammatical errors to the absurd references to Lawrence of Arabia, where do you begin?"
4,This is how technology really happens!,"This book will annoy many people by debunking the ""creation myths"" being spun around Java. It shows many otherwise unsung people trying to do the Right Thing, as they saw it; it fell to these extraordinary authors to weave those efforts into a real strategy amidst confusion, egomania, and myopic brilliance. That the strategy required stealth and influence makes the story, as well as their ultimate success, all the more remarkable. Thanks Rich and Jos, both for pulling this off, and for telling the story."
1,give credit where it is due,"Hey, its people like you who can't give Al Gore the credit he deserves for inventing the Internet!"
1,not working,This vacuum cleaner is not working.I tried this product in different cars to check whether it is the fault of my car.But it is not working in any cars.So it means this product is not working.
3,Black & Decker Dust Buster,Dust Buster worked and I was able to clean up my car but more suction power would have improved my rating.
2,Crevice attachment way too short,"I have been using this for 3 years. I can't get a corded one because I do not have access to any electricity plug around my car (I clean it in my apt parking lot).I did not expect this vacuum to be powerful since it plugs into the car. So the power is not that good but it is just what I expected.But I am disappointed because the crevice attachment is only a couple of inches. It is not long enough to reach the spots on the sides of the driver and passenger seats, at least not in my car (mustang), and I bet in many others too. Other than this, I agree with other reviewers, if blows dust around so you have to keep it very clean (which means clean the dust tank every single time you use it).Overall, not recommended at all."
3,just OK,"This vacuum is a little awkward, and doesn't get great suction. Good in a pinch. Wish it had a retractable cord, because it's a little sloppy in the trunk. Works well, good price, but probably wouldn't buy it again."
3,A little dissappointed,"Being a Black and Decker product, I was sure it would work wonderfully. However, I have used better products. It blows dust around and the filter gets clogged quickly."
3,"""Catch 22""","The vac seems powerful enough, but paraphasing the manual, the customer is to use the car's power accessory, without the engine running, but having the engine running may shorten the lifespan of the vac. Customer is cautioned that some power excessories in autos may not work without the engine running.Of coure this is not explained in the online discription."
3,Bonito y funcional,"Es muy bonito aunque parece que fuera desechable, echa demasiado aire (por el principio de funcionamiento) para lo que aspiraLa caja dice que trae la unidad principal, un esquinero, un cepillo para tapicería y un filtro, solo trajo la unidad principal y el filtro!"
5,Brilliant Design,"The Museum of Modern Art has recognized Bang & Olufsen for their design aesthetic, which they consistently combine with perfect utility. That is why I have come to expect the very best whenever I buy a B & O product. The A8 Earphones do not disappoint although they are deceptively simple. When I first held them in my hand, I thought that they looked well-made as I would have expected, but nothing extraordinary. I put them over my ears and fussed with the fit until they were comfortable, plugged them in to my iPod, and then . . . smiled.They are exactly what I was looking for: a great sounding bud-type earphone that remained in place as I worked around the house. As people have joked in other reviews of this product, you really do forget that you are wearing them. You will find this out the first time you put the telephone receiver to your ear and ask the caller to speak up, unaware that you are still wearing the earphones."
5,So comfy you'll forget you are wearing them.,"Desperate to find an earbud that would not hurt me more than my 5 mile runs, I shelled out $150 for the B&O A8. No regrets. Now the challenge is to get them away from the rest of my family so I can use them. They sound great and feel great."
3,Not blown away,"I just bought these headphones yesterday. I must say I'm a little underwhelmed. I guess I'm no ""audiophile""; I honestly can't tell much difference between these and the buds that came with my Ipod. It handles the high and low ranges much better (no distortion on bass - yea!), but mostly it's about the same. And those silly foam earpads - good grief, it took me 5-10 minutes just to get those on the earphones! And of course they fall off every time you take the earphones off. Couldn't they have come up with something that didn't require these things?But that's just my initial impressions. I hope to have a follow up review in a few months and will hopefully raise my rating to a four or five star."
3,"Decent, but better earphones are available","B & O's earphones are pretty decent, But Bose, Shure and Etymotic are much better. Bose is probably what you want if you are a bass freak + they cost $99 . Etymotic and Shure are Isolating Earphones and have a decent bass. IF you are going for either Etymotic or Shure , go for the Higher end ones. e.g. the wireless bluetooth based ETY8 from etymotic or the Shure ER-Latest version..B & O falls somewhere in the middle, Its design is quite different and it takes some time to get used to it. The sound quality is decent. But given a chance, I would not pick these up simply because the other 3 are really much better. Even sony's high end IE Earphones are pretty good."
3,Too complex for people beginning to cook with mushrooms.,"It should be edited so that beginners can better understand it. I will, however use it for reference. so there"
4,still in the dark,"Sure, great recipes. Interesting anecdotes. But there is a paucity of photos to help identify the mushrooms whose names abound. A page or two of plates giving mushroom photos with their names would go a long way. I am still faced with bushels and bushels of mushrooms I could buy, but no way to know even what category each falls into. Where I shop, mushrooms do not come with name tags."
4,multi-lingual instructions needed,"I bought this model boat for my father, who lives in Russia. I did not expect the instruction manual to be with so many pages. Now I either need to find him instructions in Russian (if they exist - Any suggestions?) or translate every page (there is a project for MY winter :). Also, the description did not say this is all plastics. If you're bringing this as a gift to someone by plane, pay attention to dimentions! This box is 30"" long, and most suitcases are 27-28"" max. I spent another $150 trying to find the largest hard-case luggage piece on the internet. I'm planning to lean the box in my suitcase under an angle, or I'll have to unpack the parts. I do hope that he will like the challenge and the gesture, and will have fun all winter."
2,American in 1812,"Old Ironsides, the oldest sailing ship afloat in the world, was never defeated in battle, but I'm having a battle with this kit. Parts shown but unnumbered and directions sometimes difficult to comprehend.If you plan to purchase this kit, construction will be much, much easier if you also purchase small tools with which to work. For example, when working with the ship's rigging, a regular pair of scissors are almost useless, even small ones. Small clamps will also be necessary to hold cemented parts together and in place while the cement (glue) dries.When complete, though, Old Ironsides will be something you'll be proud to display. And you'll learn some fascinating American history, particularly about the War of 1812.Worthwhile."
3,The remixes are lame.,"The original version is truly genius with its catchy horn riff and great production from Freakquency.But when other producers try to step in and remix it, the result is awful. Both remixes are pretty boring and don't fit the track."
3,brothers got this complex occupation...,"Okay.. so is this really a necessary purchase? I would say only if you are a fan. The ""Edroc Remix"" is definately the key selling point. It is almost more enjoyable than the original. If you really like the song ""Danger"" you will like this mix. The other remix was a bit much for me.. It sounds like having two radios on @ the same time."
3,Ridge Racer,"Really I can only recommend this soundtrack if you're a die hard Ridge Racer fan. Its pretty short, only 30 minutes. The techno found on here is very ""90s"" and it gives me a headache sometimes. There a couple of good songs on here but its so primitive in sound compared to the soundtracks of Ridge Racer here in the new millennium. For hardcore fans only."
3,Decent soundtrack.,"Ridge Racer V soundtrack is decent. There are few tracks that are really great and others so-so. For me, I liked those few exceptional tracks enough to buy the whole CD."
5,Exactly what I wanted!!,Anyone looking for a good pair of headphones to use while playing games or watching tv...these are great. I find them great to use at night when I want to watch tv without bothering others...and they are also great to play games really loud without bothering others. Anyone concerned about the battery life...don't be. I bought them three weeks ago and I am still using them about 2 or 3 hours a night and have not had to change the batteries once (and these are the batteries that come with them). Great purchase...exactly as advertised!!!!! ps...they're comfortable too....a good example of that is how often I fall asleep while watching TV....very comfortable.
5,Excellent.,"The sound from this headset is way better then I expected. I hear more sound effects then I even knew were in the game. I bought them so I wouldn't bother my wife with the noise, but I have found that I use them even when she is not home. She likes that I have them more then I do. Easy set up. No problems at all."
3,"OK, but didn't work well with XB360 COD2","I have to say most importantly: you need to hook it up as directed to get the best result. At first, I hooked it up in a way that I thought would work, but it didn't...that was my own fault, not the manufacturer's.So then I hooked it up as directed and it worked well....except for loud noises (specifically, firing a gun on COD2 for Xbox 360). The game sound was great until you fired the gun, then the sound cut out. I couldn't make any adjustments that made it better. So I returned it thinking that for the money spent, I should be completely satisfied."
4,"Excellent Sound, Mic not so Great, Pricey but still a good product!","This is a great product for $60 bucks not $100 which is what the initial price was and it keeps dropping. It does exactly what its suppose to do, gives you 5.1 stereo surround sound right at your eardrums without bothering or annoying anyone at night. Thats exactly why I got it for, plus I can also use it to watch regular tv and watch movies since it can be used with anything that uses RCA stereo outputs(the red and white wires that usually go with the yellow wire), As for the mic I don't talk much on live I just kick a**."
3,Okay headphones.,"These headphones are just okay. They work well I guess but are pretty cheaply made so I am always afraid that they will break. If I could do it all over again, I probably would purchase something with a little more of a quality feel to them."
2,Cant hear people chat very well,I got these headphones but while i was playing GOW i could only hear shotguns....No chat. Even with chat turned all the way up and sound effects down...Not happy and returned
3,1/4 GOOD and 3/4 Bad,"I bought this mic thinking it would be good for listining to the game and talking to your friends but the sound from the game was so loud that i could hardly hear any one. And the infared sucks you can bearly walk any where without loosing connection to you game, music, or private chat for the xbox 360. and the last bad thing is that it is not completly wireless you still have to plug in a wire to your controller to the mic. The only good thing about this mic is that it has good sound quality. so if you are looking for a good sounding game headset this is one for u but if you want to talk to your friends over xbox live do not get this mic go and get the actuall 360 wireless mic. I hope this helped with the purchase or non purchase of this mic"
3,Looks Doofy/Spensive,Pros:- works ok- works with xbox360Cons:- looks doofy- clunky- Expensive for a headset
2,Awesome when they work,Well when these worked they worked fine other than the fuzz you get if you block the path to the receiver. But after a few months things started breaking randomly on them. First my mic started going screwy and now I have to press down on the connector to even be able to talk. Plus I picked them up recently and twisted them just a bit and the casing on the headphone cracked. So if you want something that's going to last a long time and give a good sound don't choose these.
1,went through 2; didn't work.,"My first EarForce X2 didn't work-- the connection to the mic input on the controller is flimsy (they call it ""lightweight"" in the documentation).I returned it and got another. This time the connection worked, but even at max volume, it was about 1/5 as loud as my standard XBox Live Headset. Nobody online could hear me unless they cranked their volume way up.The instructions say to try removing the windscreen, turning the mic in other directions, and so on. That got me up to about 1/4 my standard volume.I guess if you aren't going to be using the mic, these are decent."
2,Not that good....,"I bought this one based on the previous high reviews, but I just didn't find anything memorable in this one...."
4,good print. great if you get it framed...,"I bought this gift for my boyfriend's parents, and they seemed to like it. That is all that mattered to me. I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger than it was when it came in the mail, though."
1,Everyone is allowed to have a bad moment once..,"I'm a big fan of Jan's music (see the other reviews) but this is his worst ever. It was an attempt to write and record an Arabic-disco album in one day. The bet was won, but fans were lost... Still there is one good song, the relaxed ""Blue in the shadow"""
5,Wonderful Hair and Skin Product,"I discovered this product in a mail order cosmetic catalogue. It's a wonderful product for both hair and skin. It smells good and it makes my hair and skin smooth and silky. I have ordered it several times. I wrote a letter to the manufacturer and I received a wonderful catalogue with all of their other products (hair, skin, and nail)"
1,Caution: Mybeauty Warehouse,SeaPlasma is fantastic stuff. I'm writing this review to caution potential buyers that MyBeauty Warehouse charges 7.50 to ship a single 8.50 item - almost doubling your price! Buyer beware.
1,Smells gross and does nothing.,"I have never minded a product's fragance before, but this- blegh! On top of that, it made my skin feel sticky, didn't improve my hair, and is all around pretty useless. For reference, I have long, thick, smooth wavy Asian hair."
5,low cost highest quality,"This is the best de-tangle spray I have ever used. I have very curly hair, and nothing works better. Believe me, I have tried plenty of product, many costing much much more. But I always come back to the most effective Sea Plasma!"
1,stinky stuff,I had high hopes for this product on my extremely dry skin and hair but it smelled so bad I almost gagged. I am glad others like it but it's not for me.
1,Smells terrible,Do not buy this product it smells terrible unfortunate for me it came from a private seller and would cost more to return.This product doesn't make hair any easier to comb thru and it smelled so bad I had to rehash my hair before I went out!!! Yuck
3,It's ok,"This sprays on easily and aborbs into my skin very well. I like how it doesn't feel wet or slick. The only thing I didn't like was the smell of it. Several people said they liked the fragrance, but I couldn't stand it and ended up throwing it away. I have tried other sprays and besides the smell, I will say it was the best one."
2,Could have been 5 stars but ...,"I have been buying this product for years. I use it on myself and children.I would have given the product itself 5 stars but ...I take a few stars away because half the spray pumps don't work and the customer service is atrocious. I called the 800 number on the back to ask for a new pump. The message says they don't open until 9:45. So I call back. An older man that sounds like he is in his living room tells me ""why don't you just take it back where you bought it from?"" Really?!Lastly, Harmon Face Value sells it for 4 bucks."
5,Awesome All Over Body Product,"This used to be sold in the stores. Cannot find it anywhere even in local beauty supplies. Why? Does anyone know?This not only helps before and after being in the sun, it is wonderful for face and hair. I would bathe in it if I could.As far as the reviewer, that said it had an awful smell, they must have something in their nostrils ... or maybe someone played a joke and added something to it before you used it.This product has one of the most refreshing scents, much like an ""ocean breeze."" very clean. I just want to know if it is ""safe to use on pets?""My Shih Tzu has dry itchy skin and would love to use it on his coat."
5,"Awesome hair detangler for long, curly hair!!","I don't normally write reviews, but I HIGHLY recommend this product.I have very dry, long, curly hair which gets knotted & tangled up quite a bit.I primarily use this product as a detangler after showering, and it's truly amazing, I can comb through my hair with relative ease!! It also has a pleasant, light aroma.Thank you for such a great product!"
5,UFO's are real but what are they and where are they from?,"I enjoyed the book it is well presented and edited. The book does not answer my question but that may not be possible.Even if you don't believe that UFO's are from another planet it is interesting to see how others react to unexpected encounters with something that should not be there.As a pilot, who once saw something I could not explain, I was fascinated by the book. If you think that UFO's are something made on this planet read the book it could change your mind, or even convince you that you are correct.I have no doubt they are real I saw something that was impossible for me to explain. But that doesn't mean they were from another planet or galaxy. If we are making them then we have technology I've never even dreamed of."
3,Never really gets off the ground,"As a believer in UFOs, I found this book in the library and thought that it would be a fascinating read about pilot encounters with UFOs. Well, yes and no. Some of the cases presented were truly fascinating and others were ho-hum. It could be due to Clark's writing style. He doesn't really appear to care about what he writes. His style of writing is lackluster and the reading comes across as such.For example, he will tell the story of such-and-such pilot; this is what he/she saw; the USAF investigated and came to so-and-so conclusions. OK. So what? Other stories, in which he appears to be interested, come across much better and exciting.Clark gives me the impression of trying to dismiss what he writes, so I wonder why write a book if you don't really believe in the subject matter.I thought the book would be much more interesting but it just never really takes off for my tastes."
5,Excellent overview,"This is an excellent first retail banking book. It covers all the topics of banking business, going from banking terms through Basilea, banking crashes or even a few notes on credit management. It's a perfect book for those who want to go through the retail banking world, or those who want to unerstand how the retail banking works. An state-of-the art exposition!!!"
5,Excellent History of Classic Tractors,"This book is beautiful. It is hardback and visually very appealing for any tractor enthusiast. I bought this as a Christmas gift, and I would buy it again!"
3,"its cool, but where are the greats?","They have the Aeon Flux, they have the Psychadelic Detective (""You'll never take me alive!"" ""I never said I would.""). But there is definitely some of the greatest stuff missing. Another reviewer mentioned the ""Der Mum"" shorts, I also think they should have included ""Running Man,"" and the rest of the Aeon Flux shorts. What about the short with the workers getting replaced by robots? They missed out on a lot of Cut-Up Cameras, too. This isn't a fans' choice, this just seems to be a random collection, which is sad, because Liquid Television was a truly great show."
3,"Good, but missing some key material.","This DVD has some memorable stuff, but where is some of the more bizarre stuff. Remember that bit with the postcards and that agent who narated it, starting off by saying, ""Dear, Mum...."", and how about that ""Istanbul"" video? That's why I bought it... because of those things!"
5,Wet shorts delivers!,"The first ever dvd release of this groundbreaking Mtv show! If you have been waiting like the rest of us for Mtv to re-air it your out of luck. So just buy the dvd and relive the good old days of Liquid Tv! With shorts like...Aeon Flux, The Dangwoods, Uncle Louie's Blind Date, Beavis and Butthead, bitchin' puppetized cycle babe Winter Steele and so much more. If your looking for any other title on awesome animated shorts look no more this is it!"
1,"Good Idea, poor design","I have had a battery free mouse for a few years, and the wife wanted one, I couldn't find the ""Inland products"" product so bought her this one,, But you shouldn't,,Don't waste your money, the USB cord (which needs to be attached, to the pad)is all of about 18 inches fully extended. (Do they make ""extention cords"" for USB cables,??Look around they have better ones out there,Ted"
1,False information,"To the people that have purchased this product and had success, good for you.For other considering purchasing this product should listen. There is no waythere is 30ppm of ""Colloidal Silver"" in this product. The max is 15ppm. Don'tbelieve me? Look it up or google it urself. There is something other then silverin this product if in fact a TDS test is showing 30ppm,if in fsct, consider having it testedto see what else you are ingesting in to your body. I speak for no company I make myown just thought I'd give a little FYI to the new Colloidal Silver people looking fora true product. Be well."
2,Taken for a medical problem,This product was recommended by a friend. A pharmacist told me not to take it. I could see the sense in that. Taking heavy metals into your body is not a good idea.
5,Barbie as Betty doll,I collect Barbie dolls. I also really loved Betty and Veronica comic books when I was a kid. This is the perfect combination. Barbie as Betty is a beautiful doll. I like that she is looking off to the side. It make her different from the other Barbie dolls. This is a good collectors item or to give to a child to play with.
3,Shebeest Sports Bra,"I like the fabric, the pattern, and how it feels during exercise. I do think the seams/elastic at the ribcage is disproportionately small for the size of the upper. When I put it on, I can hear stitches breaking at this line. Once on, it's a little big at the top. I purchased a shirt in the same size which is a little big."
4,Good product,"I received this product the day after I ordered it! It was easy to install and of good quality. Please note that this order is for only one of the wine holders (not two as is shown in the picture). I was under the impression that these were somehow connected when I purchased it- my mistake. Overall a good product, and would order again."
2,underpowered for any real application,"I wanted an electric string trimmer because I don't like the noise of a gas powered trimmer. A cordless trimmer appealed to me because I don't have to haul 100 feet of extension cord to use it.Even though my yard is very small (1/4 acre) and I have nothing but grass to trim along the house and fence, this trimmer was far too under-powered. It simply wouldn't cut grass efficiently. I also found the automatic string feed to be unreliable...I would always end up with about 1 inch of string and I would have to tap it against the ground to try to get it to feed. Also, I found the unit uncomfortable to use - it's poorly balanced due to the heavy battery.This season I broke down and replaced the cordless trimmer with a small 25cc gas powered unit. It is very noisy, but it gets the job quicker, easier, and better.Unless you have a complete phobia of gas powered trimmers, I would not recommend this tool."
1,Freedom to think,"""Catholicism frightens me ... enrages me"", writes the author. Now if I claimed to be a practicing Catholic, as other reviewers might, I would think twice about selling out my opinions without any substantive argument. C'est la vie, objectionable reviews are duly culled by well-meaning Jewish-leaning editors. The ones that remain look positively tame next to the editorial reviews above. I certainly hope that the author and her slavish fans can some day grow up into mature, responsible people. Chill."
1,Slavish intelligencia,"These creatures were spirits endowed with reason and will. Those who received them into themselves immediately became possessed and mad. But never, never had people considered themselves so intelligent and unshakeable in the truth as did these infected ones. Never had they thought their judgments, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions and beliefs more unshakeable."
1,Be happy,"This book seems to appeal mostly to doom 'n gloomers. Me, I could not get past the apparent lack of grammar-proofing."
1,Do not even think about it!,It's a completely nonsensical book. Don't pay much attention to a woman who thinks that India and Burma are Arab countries!
1,"Where is the ""Solutions""?",How can someone write book about a solution to a national problem where all they are doing is promoting the WPC product lines and some shallow Microsoft explanation of a server that can be found for FREE from the Microsoft Website. I could not find this book in the store to check it out before buying so I had to buy it. Don't repeat my mistake. Look for a more objective view and solution elsewhere.Is this ethical to charge money for this book??
5,Work just like the more expensive versions,Am buying another for the other set of wheels. Tried one set first to see and am very pleased with the results.Can't imagine paying 3 times as much for the heavier metal version.
3,Make Sure You Order the Right Size,"This product has more than one size. I didn't measure properly and ordered the wrong size. The instructions are OK, and it is somewhat easier to use than other, more expensive wheel chocks."
3,Small wheel stop,"Works on almost flat ground, you need to realy tighten hard to stop movement on slope. I would get the good metal ones if I do it again."
2,"Easy to use, but doesn't hold","The good: these patches go on easily and are a quick solution. The bad: perhaps my dryer runs hotter than those of other reviewers, but these patches simply didn't survive a washing. At first I assumed I must have done something wrong, so I tried a new patch and made sure to follow the instructions exactly, going so far as to use a stopwatch to make sure I ironed for the suggested time period, but one wash cycle later the patch had almost completely pulled off. I've since tried another brand of patch and it survived the wash without issue."
4,Easy to use,Never done anything like this before but product was easy to use and seemed to adhere well. Did what I needed it too.
3,Not bad,"Does the job, but mine peeled back. I've re-ironed it on my jeans, so maybe it'll hold this time. Still better than sewing, which I hate to do."
2,Didn't bond well,"I followed the instructions to a tee, but after ironing on the patch, thinking it to be bonded, the jeans were put on and the patch was coming loose around the top edge. I ended up just sewing it on, which was alot more trouble. At least, I had denim fabric."
2,Just forget the history,"If 'Gothic' means you forget all about accuracy and plausibility, then this book certainly merits the title.It's quite an enjoyable read, at least till about three-quarters of the way through, when the inaccuracies, anachronisms and implausibilities got too much for me.Inaccuracies: e.g. sowing wheat and barley in July, slave trade shipping Africans to England and then to the Americas, England in the midst of continual wars (had in 1741 just finished twenty years of peace, in fact.)Anachronisms: eg top hats, sovereigns, docks, shotguns, a tin roof ...Implausibilities: someone living in the opulence of the Ashbrooks would have a steward to look after the estate, and not need to train his son to do it. Riding shotgun (in fact it wouldn't be a shotgun) on a coach wouldn't be the sort of job you'd entrust to a half-wit.I'd like it better if it was Bjharrn on the planet of Sppljorrk. But the Disneyland eighteenth century is too much to swallow."
4,Very readable analysis of the pros and cons of managed care,"This book provides a very concise but complete discussion of the accomplishments, unfulfilled promises, and problems of managed care. This summary is useful for health policymakers and others especially interested in the subject but is written to be accessible to non-experts. The authors outline several public and private sector policy changes they believe are needed to make managed care more effective and acceptable. The book's strengths are its balanced view of managed care's pros and cons and its identification of often-ignored trade-off between preferences (particularly consumer preferences for unlimited choice of doctors and medical services) and the desire (on the part of employers and government, which pay most of the bill) to control medical care spending. This book should be required reading for everyone participating in public discussion of health care regulation and ""reform."""
3,"Heavy, heavy, heavy !",I was surprised how unexpectedly heavy the glasses are compared with the set I bought some 10 years ago.
1,Not worth the price,"Don't let the price fool you, this is a budget release! How it was listed at $14.95, I don't know! I bought mine directly from Amazon, and it had a price sticker on the cellophane wrapping for $4.99, and the quality shows it! Eight of the cartoons are found on the first Rhino DVD, and with much better picture and sound. The other five are only here, but with even worse picture and sound! Worse yet, all of the wrap-arounds are found on the two Rhino DVD's! Skip this, and get the two Rhino releases titled ""Cartoon Classics vols. 1 and 2"". Each is about the same price as this rip-off, each is a remastered full-quality release, and there is a link to both of them right here on this product page!!"
4,Just what I expected,"Since there wasn't much description of the product from the seller, I was little worried about getting the right edition. But it came as what I expected. So that is Great! However, I bought another used book which they just said ""good"" condition, but it was actually a better one than this product which was marked as ""like new"". I would really appreciate it if the seller put a transparent plastic cover over the dust jacket just like the other seller did. It will make it so much easier for me to take care of it.But still, overall it worth the money and I love the book a ton. Thanks"
5,A bit of feminism mixed with humor and a touch of satire...,"Angela Carter mixes satire and feminism to create an unusual but funny character in Sophie Fevvers. She is a non-traditional ""woman"" who burps and farts in the company of one certain man who ends up falling for this 6 foot two circus arialiste who sports dyed blonde feathers and an outfit of sequends. A very interesting look at life without men; circus clowns without a circus; etc"
4,Had Me Going Until the End :-(,"Most of the other readers here have gushed about this work. For the most part, I uphold the sentiment that this is an amazing piece of work--no pun intended. I give it four stars because most of it is genuinely impressive, but the story only holds up for the first two-thirds. Seems like I'm alone here, but I was profoundly disappointed by the last half of the third section, and ultimately that ruined the book for me. Despite the fact that it's all just one big fantasy, it got so far-fetched that I couldn't buy into it any longer. So be forewarned--it's not without flaws."
4,Earthily airborne,"Only Angela Carter could have devised the coarse golden character of Fevvers, the Cockney miracle around whom this tale spins. Girl takes wing, boy flies after, girl loses and gets wing and boy -- that's mad enough, but it gives not the least taste of the crumbled, intricate, and ultimately wonderful world of this particular circus. Carter's ability to interlace sharp doses of political and intimate realities into the mix not only teaches you lessons unaware, but opens you to a larger definition of what can be. Once upon a time, or somewhere right now, chimpanzees condescend to humans, monstrosities speak with wise prophesy, a pig manages a business better than her owner. So open up another bottle of champagne, and surrender. It will be rough, it will hurt, it will be uproarious. It will ultimately be wonderful. So is this book."
2,You either like it or hate it,"This text is very eccentric. I had to read it for an English class, and there was a mix of different reviews. Some loved it, some hated. I myself could not get through all of it (though I did make it to page 223). I suppose that the best way to tackle this novel is to realize that narrative is a big part of it, as well as is magic realism. The line between fact and fiction almost does not exist here. Logic cannot be applied when reading this novel. What is fact, what is fiction? Try to not distinguish the two while reading it and you may find yourself getting through it much more smoothly than I did."
4,A Book That Keeps You in Suspense!!!,"Mr. Lindsay's work can be greatly compared to the likings of Donald Goines and Walter Mosley all wrapped up into one. When I finished reading Prayer of Prey, the first thoughts that came to mind were of the the movie, Devil in a Blue Dress, by Walter Mosley, which was based from the book. So I would not be surprised if Tony Lindsay's work is not brought to life on screen because his writings just leave you wanting more. I am not a suspense thriller reader, but Prayer of Prey was excellent."
4,Great buy,"Colors were a little off from what was shown in the picture. Comfort and support is a little below average, but it's a casual shoe. I've gotten nothing but compliments on these. I like them and it appears as though many other people do as well."
2,Ho Hum!,I didnt like it and I returned these pair of shoes. They were ugly and didnt appeal to my taste. Not too comfortable either. I wouldn't recommend this at all. There are better looking shoes out there and this ain't it!
3,ok shoe for $20,Got this $20 for my boyfriend. He was disappointed that the picture isn't exactly as shown. The bottom and sides of the rubber portion of the shoe was orange color and not white as shown in the picture. If you don't mind the shoe having orange around it then its for you. Its not well padded like name brand shoes ie puma or k-swiss but you get what you pay for which is $20 on sale. The unlisted orange tag on the bottom of the inside of the shoe doesn't rub off on his white socks. The shoe feels like its made out of some faux leather rather then genuine leather...maybe because its cheap leather material.
3,Not what you offer!,"This product did not have the quality of the brand you said it was, actually I don't think it was real. Beside they were bigger for the size on it. Very dissapointed."
4,Really good shoes,I ordered these for my husband and my son. They both loved them and said that they are very comfortable.
1,Batter's glove shoe,"Good price, but cheap and unappealing product. Product looked betteron screen. Wore them once but never again. A waste of money for me."
3,Not as comfortable but looks good,The material used to make this shoe feels cheap. Especially since its from Kennoth Kole. I expected more but I guess people buy it for the look and price.The shoe is pretty light weight and feels thin on the inside. I would not run in these shoes or do any types of sport in them because they might break and doesnt feel comfortable.I would still buy these shoes again though
3,shoe from picture looks better..,Decent overall. Good as summer shoe because material is thin but so not alot of comfort. It is different from the picture. The bottom sole is brown/yellow instead of white. The back of shoe has the same color of the stripe instead of white. Paid 19.89 and definately not worth more than 20 bucks.
5,WOW!!,This book is one of the best Pike books to date. I mean it makes you feel like everyone was the killer even the victim. The story is very complex but with a very happy ending.
3,"A fast read, but predictable and not his best.","I decided to read this book for fun, and that's what I got. I was disappointed, however, that I could tell before the characters who had committed the murder. The turn out is almost ""normal,"" but it's still exciting. Some of Pike's other books would be better choices for the real adventure loving reader."
5,Unbelievably awesome,"I got hooked on Christopher Pike back when I was 13, but 6 years later I still read all his books religiously. He is one incredible writer. All his books are great, and especially this one, so trust me(and millions of other readers of Chris) and buy this book. You won't regret it. It's spellbindingly suspenseful and the ending is more than perfect."
1,not his best by far,"Ok, so I love Christopher Pike. I have read all of his books and have enjoyed every one of them except this one. I got the impression that the ending was decided by him at the last minute during writing. The story went VERY slow. The ending was not predictable, but that was only because it was SO unrealistic not beleivable. It could have never happened. I don't mean that in a supernatural sense either because this is not one of his sci/fi books, this story was supposed to be beleivable to the reader and it was far from it."
4,Interesting descriptions of Israel and of the Jewish law.,I thought that this book was quite intersesting and enjoyable. I dont know if all the locations in Israel is as accurate.
3,Superficial information,"This was not a very useful book. It had lots of hikes listed, but there were no maps of the hikes, only general location maps. Descriptions were superficial and did not give consistent information for things like elevation gain, distance, etc. Descriptions frequently added sidetrips or loop suggestions, but it was hard to figure out how long or hard the whole hike would be. The best part was the ""subjective"" information rating the difficulty and scenic aspects, plus comments about how crowded the trails could be, but this wasn't enough to offset the basic lack of good information. I did not feel there was enough information to plan hikes and know I could do them without buying separate maps, which is a pain when you are travelling and trying to go to alot of different areas and pick a few hikes in each."
3,Foghorn Outdoors Oregon Hiking,"The book is well organized by regions and has a good variety of trail descriptions. They rate difficulty of hike, the length of the trail, the estimated time, and the trail directions. The only thing I wished they would also provide, besides the regional map with location where the described hikes are, is a map of each suggested hike, that shows the layout of the trail, contour lines, and names of the surrounding peaks, rivers, lakes, etc."
3,a work of art!,"This is a beutifully made epic,directed (and photographed) by italianmovie genius Mario Bava.It stars the magnificent Cameron Mitchell,thebeutiful Kessler sisters,Alice and Ellen,and a great italian actor,George(Giorgio) Ardison.Mitchell and Ardison, had allready starred in another viking epic ""Thelast of the vikings"" Fairly good,but not as near as good as this one.The dvd features a superbly restored ,uncut version of the film.Get it!Christian Karlsson,Sweden"
4,"Wonderful, detailed book","Full of well-written, in-depth characters, Winter Passing held me captive until the last page. The suspense in this story does not lie in the present but in the past. What really happened? How? Why?The romantic subplot and the good guys vs. bad guys provide an amusing, if not page-turning, backdrop. The real story, though, is in the details. Present-day Austria comes alive amidst stories of the past. Holocaust victims and survivors, treasure-hunters, family legends, family secrets and unconditional love fill the pages.I was hooked from the first page. Definitely a must-read."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"This is a novel with some meat. A little history--enough to convey a message and pique some interest in the WWII era, two love stories, the value of friendship, a female role model and a mystery. Circumstances in the book bring Darby to a profession and an awakening of faith.I try to find books that I can share with my neices who are in Sr. High. Some Christian books geared to a little older audience have a little too much ""romance"" making me feel uncomfortable sharing them. This book did not cross the line, but still offered an ""adult"" read."
3,Jottings of an old hand,"I was disappointed by this book. I realised that Martin Rees is an experienced distinguished scientist and I hoped that his insight and experience would shine thru in Six Numbers. I feel it doesn't. The book feels like something written quickly to satisfy a publication deadline...written without passion...perhaps dictated in the shower with the details being filled in afterwards. I didn't find the central argument, that the numbers are too fortunate to have come about by chance, convincing."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"This book is full of repititious metaphors which seem to be designed to impress the reader with the author's knowledge, or perhaps to rouse mindless support for more research in cosmology. Although I agree with the author's sense of awe at the 'fine tuning' of our universe and his admission that it could not be found to be otherwise, I find that this book does very little to explain or explore crucial concepts which would have made this book imensely deeper without neccissarily introducing needless complexity and confusion. All in all, I get the sense that the author writes in the manner of a high school student, who writes the same thing over and over again in only slightly different words because they didn't get it quite right the first time, and in order to achieve a requisite length. A sumary of this book, however, would likely be quite enjoyable as a substitution for the real thing."
5,A Great Intro to Contemporary Cosmology,"I hesitate to recommend any book of popular cosmology, since a reader's enjoyment of the subject is so dependent on feeling comfortable with the depth of the author's mathematical analysis. ""Six Number"" is on the basic end of the math spectrum (though any discussion of superstring theory leaves my head spinning), but the author is able to convey the awe of current observational cosmology to the general reader without ""dumbing down"" the concepts.The book is short, but absolutely awe inspiring. He resists the temptation to wax religious and cosmic, but it leaves you saying: ""Wow, what does it all mean?""A great book!"
4,Just Six Numbers,This was my third copy of this book. I have an amateur interest in astrophysics. I also have a group of friends who share that interest. I purchased the last two copies for two of these friends. I was impressed by the depth of thought contained in Just Six Numbers. The author did an excellent job in explaining complicated mathematical/scientific laws into understandable layman's terms. It helped greatly to have at least an elememtary background in physics/mathematics to grasp the real significance of the discussions.
3,Interestig book,ACTUALLY I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY BROTHER. HE REALLY LOVED IT!THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEND IT TO HIM. Since he is in prison that is the only way he can get a book; it has to be from a book company. I can't just send it to him. It really means a lot to him to get the books that he really wants. Amazon is doing a great job.
5,Languid trippiness,"Think of Quebec as Mollusk II. They go for the goofy (""Happy Colored Marbles"", Hey There, Fancypants"") and the watery, dappled waves of the ethereal is everywhere. And of course, one song that is bound to have you shaking your head (""The F***ked Jam""). Great pot album, specially if your weed is nice and fluffy. This is a little browner than ""White Pepper""(what isn't?) but really, this is a groove more than it is an album, and the perfect one to light up to, barely anything to disturb the euphoria of a better world than the one you left."
5,Favorite Ween Album,I just love the progression of this album. Ween offers a rare look into the right side of your brain.. No matter who you are.
2,Not the best effort...,"I am surprised at all the positive reviews (especially the one from the guy who hasn't heard the album yet). I've listened to this album 5 times now, giving it plenty of chance, and only 2 songs have stuck out as good (So Many People in the Neighborhood and Happy Colored Marbles). The rest is really bad, especially when compared to other awesome Ween albums like The Pod, Pure Guava, Chocolate & Cheese, and the Mollusk.Buy a whole album for 2 songs? That's up to you."
1,I think it's over,"No joke - I actually listened to this cd while driving through Quebec. I just think it's over. It's sad, but true. It's just not as interesting, just not as funny, just not as weird. I still think Mollusk is best. Ohh well, I love Ween, but I don't like Quebec - period."
5,What a great album! Ween does it again.,"Do these guys ever do anything wrong? Quebec is yet another triumph for Ween. I'm have no idea where these guys get their ideas, but each album they put out gets better and more creative as they continue to mature and grow as musicians."
5,The editorial review is the most retarded thing I've ever read.,"Just say Quebec rocks just like all WEEN. Enough said. Where did this so-called ""critic"" learn to write anyway. Save your fancy-pants vocabulary for your over-socialized, intellectual wanna-be, wine and cheese crowd."
5,Pink Floyd + Beck + The Beatles = WEEN,"The Best Album Ever! I Was First Captured By Track #5 ""So Many People In The Neighborhood."" Being A Big Fan Of South Park and Knowing Ween is one Of Matt And Trey's Favorite Bands, I Decided I Must Have This CD. I Wasn't A Big Fan Of Some Of The Songs At First, But After Listening To This CD More Then Once I Started To Love The Starang High Pich Vocals on ""Happy Coloured Marbles"" And The Tom Petty Beckish Qualitley Mixed With Their Own Style On ""Tried And True."" And Their Pink Floydish (If That's A Word) Beatles Quality In All The Songs. Although This Review Probubly Didn't Make Tones Of Sense I'll Make It Simple BUY THIS CD!!!Ween Has Now Turned In To One Of My Favorite Bands. I Sugest This CD For Everyone. Thanks 4 Reading.:)"
3,MY PANDY!!!!,"it seems silly to even bother to write a review of this album considering that if you're a ween fan you're gonna buy it no matter what i say, and if you're not a ween fan you should start from the begining and get this one way down the road. but...... as a long time fan i gotta say that this one hasn't gotten to me right off the bat. i just bought it a couple hours ago and i've only listened to it once, and it pains me to admit that it kind of bored me. BUT!!!!!! that means absolutely nothing. i concede that ween is ten times smarter than me and i'm sure that after a few more listens i'll probably think this is the best album ever. ween needs to grow on you. i'm sure this one will, but after one listen.... whatever. it's ween. i'm not worried. i'm sure it's great. i think choc and cheese was the only album i liked right away. i'm sure this one will prove genious after a few more listens."
4,Live at the Roxy (import),"""live at the roxy"" is a great compulation of Brian's work. This import CD is also distributed in Europe. I got both, the US and the European version(with the extra tracks) If you already have the domestic version don't spent another 50 bucks. You better save it for a live concert of Brian and the wondermints. His PETSOUNDS tour beats this CD by far!!!"
4,Good product for the right projects,"The setup and cleanup is an overhead that makes this product useful only for moderate to large projects. This is true of $2500 sprayer systems I've used, however, so it may be endemic to power sprayers in general. I bought this for a house I'm remodeling, and I've learned to plan ahead and paint 2-3 rooms at a time with it to justify the setup and cleanup time. When the hose is pressurized, it is stiff and a bit ungainly, so you also need to avoid ""painting yourself into a corner."" The spray pattern is good. Bottom line, I've saved a lot of time and effort and gotten great results with this unit."
2,One-time use,"As others have discussed, this product is effectively a one-use product. I don't feel too awful since I bought a recon unit off eBay for less than $100. It worked liked a champ for my painting of a large farm shed. Then, as others describe, the pressure dropped significantly. I was still able to use it to paint another small shed, but it was slow going. As others discovered the primary problem is the outlet valve. I ordered two replacement ones for about $30 and thought that would at least allow me to finish the other buildings, but both of these failed within two hours. Experiences seem to vary with this machine; maybe you'll roll the dice and get 30-40 hours before replacing parts. The gun and operation are excellent, however, so I will probably upgrade to a 9140 or 1420 so I can at least re-use the gun and hose."
1,If you are going to use it once no problem,"I purchased this product and the first time I used it worked great, no complaints. However, I recently pulled it out where I had it setup for long term storage poured some paint in the reservoir and tried to prime it...nothing. Tried painting with it....nothing. Cursed at it....nothing. Wanted to kick it but refrained...I had to maintain some semblance of control. For what I used to paint with it...I guess it would had cost about the same as hiring a professional so I guess I am even. Hell will freeze over before I purchase another Wagner."
1,Absolute Junk-Dont Waste Your Hard Earned Money!,"Bought 2 months ago for my hubby to paint garage this month, so I cant even return the damn thing. We got primer on the shed and about two feet of a two story two car garage and the thing quit. Just stopped. We emptied the paint, cleaned the unit, primed it AND strained the paint just to be sure and started again, and got about another two feet into the job and it stopped again. Went down 22.5 miles to Home Depot and asked about the history of this unit, and they said it DOESNT HANDLE EXTERIOR LATEX paint very well. Well that is why I bought it!!It says it can handle that type of paint. What, are they just lying to make a sale?Bought a Graco, worth every penny. This Wagner is a hunk of crap."
1,Junk,The sprayer started out fine but quickly turned into a disaster.It did not respond to repeated cleaning.It would have been easier to brush and roll. I use an HVLP sprayer but I wanted something that would do a larger quantity than just a quart. I think this sprayer is worthless!
1,So so performance,"I bought this unit to spray latex paint. The first round with it went pretty well, but the tip had a tendency to clog even after straining the paint and the filter in the gun handle. Regardless, it had a 10"" spray width (no adjustment) and did a pretty good job. What I didn't realize was how much a pain it was going to be to clean the built in paint tray and associated parts. After the 3rd time using it I was cleaning the unit and the pump totally quit pumping water. I troubleshooted it some, but then I gave up and returned it for a full refund. IMO, if you need an airless sprayer, get one where it has a tube to go into the paint or a hopper/bin that you can wash directly in water versus this thing."
3,"Worked great, the first time...","Really liked this spray unit the first time I used it. Put on lots of paint and it cycled on and off as it should have. (Turns off when the preasure is up to spec. and on as you spray)It was totally cleaned and put away to be used for the next weekend. Problem then was that it would not get up to preasure (would just run constantly with a very poor spray pattern). Took all the paint out, throughly cleaned again but still the same problemCan't see spending almost 200.00 for a unit that works once. Will be returning it."
4,Overall very nice,"I really liked this painter, especially after struggling with the earlier Wagner power painters.As mentioned, the hopper design isn't the best and will not pump with less than 1 gallon in the hopper.However, to me the cleanup issue, isn't bad. I just filled with water and ""let her rip."" Cleaned up beautifully. One thing you must do is take the sprayer apart and be sure to clean it's filter very well. I suspect failure to do this was the cause of some of the reviewers problems.I would definitely recommend this product, especially for less than 200 bucks."
3,good but not great,"As others have said, it takes a LOT of time to get ready to use this sprayer and clean up after, even if you are using it outside, even with Latex paint. But results can be great when done. The specific problem I had with using it was the hose, which was so stiff and inflexible that I had to hold the hose with one hand and the sprayer with the other. Otherwise, the stiff hose just ended up directing the nozzle in any old direction."
1,Pure Trash,I can't believe all the positive reviews of this sprayer. I borrowed this from a friend and got less than a gallon of latex paint on the wall before it seized up. I needed to get my house finished so I went to the store and bought a replacement for the one that I thought I had ruined. That one lasted most of the day before it quit so I took it back to the store and they replaced it. I finished the job and gave my friend the nearly new unit. He told me that he had the same experience and the unit he loaned me had been replaced under warrany after 2-3 days of use. I could have painted my house with a roller in the time it took me fighting this sprayer.
4,Good unit,"Worked like a champ. There is a learning curve but once you get a hang of it it applies paint quick and easy. I did use the product Floetrol to help with the paint flow. Its worth it buying a hose swivel if you can afford the 20-30 dollars extra. The only complaint with this model however is that there is no pressure control. It only shoots one pressure which in my case worked fine. Overall I am glad I bought the unit, was able to spray the entire small house in one day, twice."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"THIS PRODUCT WILL WORK GREAT FOR ONE JOB...AFTER YOU CLEAN IT PROPERLY FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS ,OIL AS DIRECTED AND PUT ON A SHELF IN YOUR GARAGE....AND WHEN YOU USE IT AGAIN FOR THE SAME JOB (FOR ME,I BOUGHT MINE FOR MY FENCE TO SPRAY STAIN EVERY 3 YEARS)...THE DAMN THING WILL NOT OPERATE!!!...THIS IS A ONE JOB PIECE OF JUNK!!!...DO NOT BUY"
4,solid machine,"this is a good product. i painted the body of a large 2 story house in less than 2 days. it has a few issues, as others have mentioned. the output gasket blew on me after about 8 gallons of paint but i took the blown gasket to the hardware store and bought a few rubber o rings of the same size. has worked perfectly since then. clean up takes a while, but i do think i saved time. best for big jobs, but a good machine."
4,An A-Z reference,"If you want a book for microeconometrics such than whenever you need to look at a topic or subjects related to a topic, this is your book. If you need a very deep and comprehensive discussion about a topic, you need more than this. It may be not sufficient, but for sure it is a necessary book for anyone who does applied econometrics. I enjoy reading this book."
5,A thorough book bring you to a higher level of understanding Economtrics,"This is so far the most ""thorough"" book about Econometric methods and applications, bringing you with a rather ""pilot"" view to the Econometric theories and methods."
3,"Nice appearance, but poor stand up quality","Very nice boots, but they started to split in the fabric seems in the back of the boots - I would send them back for a refund, but shipping costs are too high to get my money out of it - they should really send me another pair in place of them as I only had them for 2 weeks and then they started to tear."
2,Cheap,I bought these boots hoping they would hold up and not two weeks after I received them they have ripped along the back seam. I was very disappointed.
5,perfect gift,"I bought this huge, beautifully bound and photographed volume of chicago architecture for my uncle, a transplanted native of chicago. He misses his city greatly- and loved this. It was perfect."
2,Potential that doesn't Pay Off,"I'm a second generation Nez fan, with a large collection of music and video of the man. I thought the book would be a natural extention of Mr. Nesmith's wit and intelligence. I was mistaken. The book is well written, but the story takes so many turns in so many directions, as if to hit a mark in every genre, that the story falls short. Perhaps the novel would have been better if it were a collection of short stories. In fact, I would suggest trying to read Neftoon Zemora that way...It might make more sense and be more enjoyable."
3,"Different, not a page-turner",I got this because I absolutely had to read something from Michael Nesmith. I think he has a pretty good story and maybe his next book will be awesome.
3,Confusion...,"I am a big Michael Nesmith fan and eagerly anticipated reading his book. It has a great blend of fantasy and reality, engaging characters, and is rather beautifully and intelligently written. However, the plot has so many twists, turns and bizarre happenings that I felt to an extent that the author was toying with me whilst congratulating himself for it. I was left with the feeling that I should have enjoyed this book, and was puzzled as to why I didn't. However, I do plan to read it again, just to be sure..."
3,what did you expect?,"Carlos Castaneda meets Tom Robbins...halfway.And 30 years too late.Join the amateur author now, as he utilizes decades of daydreams to reinvent geography, geometry, physics, optics, history, anthropology, race relations, and the social contract...or whatever else pops into his head.There's an outside chance you'll even be glad you did, at last part of the time."
3,Found Book . . . . only OK,"To be perfectly honest, this book was just okay. There were some GREAT passages in the book and some truly exciting moments, but I couldn't really get into it that much. Parts of it WERE a little boring, but others made up for it."
4,Is this what they call perfection?,"Well, is it? I strongly doubt it even though I found the book to be somewhat of a master piece, for who says what perfect is? Since I don't have a clear definition of the word 'perfect' I am afraid I cannot give it more than 4/5. As I'm not a Monkees-fan (though I admit my choice of e-mail address to be very Monkee-ish) I may not have expected as much from this book as all my fellow reviewers. To be quite honest I didn't think that much of Mr Nesmith before, but now I respect the man fully and found his philosophical points in the book to be very interesting and worth to think about. The book was very much like a painting of a circle. Very intense and spellbinding. It took me four hours, non-stop, to read this book and that has only happened to me once before ( with Ernest Hemingway's ""A moveable feast""). I read that Mr Nesmith is currently writing his second book. If that is so I will most certainly be one of the first ones to buy it!"
1,Pure drivel! A waste of money. Go back to music Michael!,"I cant believe this musical God gave up music to become an author. This is the most disjointed book I have ever read in my lifetime. The book starts out with Nez learning about this legend, finding love with Neftoon,becoming invloved with this child pornongraphy ring and ending up with the ATF raiding the place and taking Neftoon away from Nez forever. This is a horrible book and I wish I could get those hours back that I wasted reading the book. Beware! This is a strange book that is loved only by his most obsessed fans."
1,not very good,"I really don't know what can pass for spiritual these days, but this doesn't even come close. Probably was only published because of the famous name attached to it. Don't read."
1,Ugh!,I tried to read this jumbled book but it was agony. The author couldnt figure out what genre he was writing in. I do not recommend this book at all. Disjointed!
4,A story of the real 2012,"While the media pumps out apocalyptic science-fiction fantasies centering around the world ending in 2012, the story we don't hear about centers on the slow, continuous destruction of people and families in America other than irrelevant en masse news briefs on the state of the global hivemind. While the movie spends a lot of time with Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) and how his sudden loss of income affects him and his family, director John Wells made sure he didn't let the talents of the rest of the star-studded cast go to waste. Most notable is Tommy Lee Jones who is brilliant as a top-level executive struggling against the ""business-friendly"" policies of his company and what they do to the lives of those around him. It ends the way I expected, unfortunately."
2,Company Men,"Not what I expected for a great cast of actors. Kinda boring movie. If you were one of the many americans that lost there jobs do to recession cutbacks and you were in a large cushie company job, it will bring back memories."
4,A Hollywood Fable,"America no longer makes anything, and that's what's wrong with it. Or that is at least the message of ""The Company Men,"" a heavy-handed but nevertheless engrossing film about the cannibalizing of a shipping company, which is in itself a metaphor for the cannibalizing of the American manufacturing sector (hardworking and honest workers) by the financial sector (silver-tongued and slick-haired accountants). Everyone gives solid, credible performances (including Kevin Costner and Ben Affleck), and the movie moves at a good pace.It's a movie that's meant to pull at the heartstrings of all those millions of the angry and confused, and it works. But perhaps it works all too well -- the message is far too optimistic and simplistic for the times that we face. But it's Hollywood, after all."
2,"Bleak to the Point of Boring,","I have no qualms with watching movies that deal with hard hitting issues, but we are dealing with a sort of realized fiction that has to have some sort of spark to keep the viewer interested. The Company Men doesn't have that spark. The characters come across as cardboard cut outs of the problems that are going on today, they lack any sort of depth. From Affleck to Nelson, everyone here seems to be nothing more than a placeholder, couple that with stilted and unimaginative dialogue and the entire movie is snore city."
2,"""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie""","Here is a junky, TV-style version of the new millenium recession. It has all the hypocrisy and schmaltzy platitudes of a Disney Newseum, person-of-week report. There is Tommy Lee Jones as a saintly executive who is canned but starts his own business and saves all his old cronies from the poor house. (Happens all the time!) There is laid-off hotshot Ben Affleck, whose family loves him so much they even like living with the in-laws. (Downsizing is great for family values!) There is a really disturbing scene where Affleck chooses to work for his brother-in-law, Kevin Costner, instead of robbing a bank. (Pathetic!) There is one convincing character who manages to make it clear that suicide really is painless, but, in the end, it is just more pandering crap from the writer-director who gave us THE WEST WING."
2,Not that good,"I was very disappointed in this movie. In spite of the big name stars the movie previews are actually better than the movie itself. I gave it two stars because of the actors, don't buy it. If you want to watch it out of curiosity, rent it at the video store."
1,i could not watch it from my ipad,i tried to watch this but for some reason you cannot watch amazon prime videos on the ipad. i would ove to see the movie perhaps its time to use itunes
1,Company Men... not so good,"We were very disapointed in this movie. The language was awful! We thought it would be funny and entertaining; however, it was far from that. We would not recommend this movie, in fact, we have destroyed the DVD we purchased."
2,confusing title,"I was expecting to see the movie itself and not a kind of trailer. Don't know what happened, but I thoguht was downloading the movie."
3,Worth the time,"Good cast , good movie. Not one I will forever remember , but certainly worth watching. I'll put it on the shelf and maybe watch it in another year."
3,Up the Ladder and down the ladder ...,"Before my husband and I watched this video, my opinion of ""Company Men"" had been harsh,I would gather that most people have a bitter taste regarding big shots.This DVD lets the viewer see what happens in their world, especially how they treat each when hard times turn their lives up side down.The rug jerked out from under them.How they deal with unemployment, a complete change of their life style.Although, if I had given this any thought ... they step on people going up the ladder surly on the way down they get their's.It's about their friends, how much they really like each other, their wives and how they deal with their husbands downgrade.Toward the end of this DVD, opinions vary, I do not want to release spoilers, as I might if I continue.I enjoyed this DVD, probably not one I would watch again, probably not my first or second choice for purchase. 3 stars. But, did enjoy a different look through the eyes of another."
4,Nice Small Movie About Losing a Job,"A very relevant small movie about a group of men let go from a company. The men are all late 30s and older. The trouble they go through and the suffering is all very relevant. Quiet, soft spoken and true. Not a movie to spend a date night but one that needed to be made, especially when small movies aren't made very often in Hollywood anymore. Every actor is just right and there is not grandstanding to be had."
3,"Not bad, but...","...this movie is a bit exaggerated in some places and too preachy in others. One wonders what Ben Affleck's compensation was in comparison to, let's say, a carpenter who worked on the set... What I found amusing, though, is how the wealthy Hollywood types are out of touch with the real world. In the latter part of the film Ben Affleck gets an offer for an $80k a year and mentions that he used to make twice as much at this previous job. So let's see, here we have a guy who's been written as a $160k professional, and yet somehow he's living in an $850k house and drives a Porsche. That's stretching it a bit too thin."
5,Great movie,"Great actors, and true to life. The quality of the dvd is great, and the delivery was as scheduled. Its a great movie to had to ones collection"
5,AMAZING!!!!,"i would recommend this movie in a heart beat, right down to earth. i never write these but this one was worth commenting on"
4,Stellar Cast - a bit rushed at the end,"I found this movie to be entertaining, and the cast is top notch. The story is all too real with the tough economy the U.S.A. has been going through. Having seen it now, the pace of the story seems odd. There is so much time spent setting up the story and introducing the characters, that the end seems somewhat rushed and they tried to tie it up in a neat little bow and that just didn't work for me. I expected a little more substance after seeing the trailer.It's about corporate downsizing, loyalty, family and friends. The story is compelling but doesn't quite go anywhere. They could have rewritten the last 30-40 minutes and answered lots of questions that are just left hanging. If the price is right, get it. I did like it. Just don't pay top dollar for it. It is a little flawed. The cast can make up for some of that however. They are great. One thumb up!"
3,Too Much Like Real Life When Things Are Not Going Well,"This movie is too much like real life when things are not going well. It is a deeply depressing reminder that sometimes, people lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and the repercussions can ruin lives.Although I think the topic is unfortunately very, very pertinent to today (2012), it was kind of like watching a very sobering and downer news report of the economy tanking. The acting is first-rate, the story interesting, but ultimately, the movie was so real, it was not much of an excuse for entertainment. If I want real, I will watch the evening news or maybe a Michael Moore documentary. (I know, I know, movies can be about ""real life"" and still be quite good. I just was not in the mood to be reminded how bad the unemployment situation is.)"
3,I only saw the preview.,It looked kind of neat in the preview I imagine I'll see the movie eventually. So 3 stars seems fitting.
5,A MANDATORY WATCH FOR POLITICIANS,An unnerving insite into what is actually going on today in our Corperate world. Piercing right into the heartsof the hard working upwardly mobile corperate who are discovering that they dont have life made. Rathertaking the lessons from thier past or History...they choose to chase the dangleing carrot of materialism. Inthis film some survive and some don't. Tough times brings out the worst or the best in all of us. But for thegrace of God go I. A movie that hopefully will encourage all to look at what we are building our hopes ourdreams and our country on sand or stone. Loyalty does and can exhist. And it is shown beautifully in this Film.
1,"Bitter taste, poision in a bottle!","wasted my money! this product gave me a bitter taste in my mouth, made me dizzy, nautious churning feeling in my stomach, and sleepy. I stopped taking it when I found out it contains arsenic. (read the fine print on the bottle) Its pretty gross stuff, save your money!"
2,Don't last long...,"I have found that Trumark makes the best tubular bands. These lasted a couple of hundred rounds, about an hour of target shooting, and then tore where they attach to the left fork. These are supposed to be ""Magnum"" Power Bands. The Trumark heavy pull bands are much harder to pull and have tremendous velocity. My favorite bands are the Trumark RRT, tapered power bands I use for target shooting. Very long lasting, same pull strength as these Barnett bands and very good velocity."
1,peace of rubbish,The bands are too strong for the leather pouch. After I mounted the bands on my crosman copperhead the leather pouch broke close to the band attachment after only 2 shots. Returning it is more expensive that get another one. Do not waste your time and money with this peace of junk.
2,Weak and brittle,Long story short: less than 50 shots and the rubber band came off. The one dollar ones in gift shops are more durable.
3,Not 55 minutes long,"There are some good cartoons here along with some mediocre / bad ones. My main issue is the dvd does not have 55 minutes worth of cartoons, or over an hour as stated on the dvd publisher's website. Its got about 35 minutes of cartoons total, and a few comics panels to browse through."
3,well worth the price.,"This project is a real bold effort, and although some of it didn't do much for me, honestly, the stuff on it that DID was pretty gutsy. Its amazing what one can do with the resources we have, thanks to the modern miracle of Flash software. The cartoon industry should take a cue from this (and the ""Triplets of Belleville"")the Walt Holcombe cartoon alone makes the DVD worth buying.I only hope that this is a primer for a follow up from Bright Red Rocket that will be even better......."
2,"Love the cartoonists, but...","I recently bought this because I love the work of Tony Millionaire, Kaz, and Jim Woodring. It was neat to see them all, but at less than an hour and no ""extras"" I feel kind of cheated (although I shouldn't say that since I pretty much knew I would feel that way, but I HAD to see it.) It's almost like watching the old MTV show Liquid Television (I was heartbroken when that show stopped airing). Maybe rent it if you can find it at any store."
5,Would buy again,"This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas this year and she loved it. The only bummer was one of the valves was sticking, her instructor was able to oil it and get it functioning properly. The red color is very nice and will be exciting to see at her next school concert. Also the case sticks a bit when closing it."
2,The bezel isn't silver,The picture makes the bezel look silver and it's not. Can't ch age it either. Amazon did the right thing and gave me my money back though.
