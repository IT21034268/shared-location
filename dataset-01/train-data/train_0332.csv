3,Ain't It Always Like That?,"You finally get all the songs you want to hear from a certain recording artist and there's a passel of remakes in it? Sure, the songs have a charm of their own done again years later, but some people (like myself) remember every little nuanace of a favorite song, a small note on the guitar, the singer going a little higher on a certain note, etc. that recalled a time or times back when, when you and that special person were listening to the song when it was new. If you don't care about such little things, sure, the songs are good, yes, they are, so buy it. We ARE talking Don Gibson after all."
1,Disappointed,Not the original recordings and not spelled out in the ads. My fault I should have listened to the samples. Now I have to buy what I thought I was getting.
5,One of the World's Greatest Singer of Country Music.,Chet Atkins said Don Gibson was the best vocal that he had ever recorder with. Truly a great singer that I've never get tired of hearing.
3,British music in U.S.A.,"Although foreign music is making a comeback in America, I, and many others, still need to get used to it. Besides Grace Jones and Sugar Ray, Brittish music isn't all too bad. The songs were okay....some but they didn't really fit the movie. Just look at a picture of Ralph Fiennes in Avengers costume and listen to the CD. It's just not......them."
5,Finally!,"I was fourteen when Space: 1999 came out. I even bought the original Moonbase Alpha Manual that Starlog sold. (Didn't know it become a collector's item or I would've kept better care of it.) Anyway, I was always anxious to see this series in a collected form worthy of my hard earned dollars one day. Finally! My wish came through. I even invited my wife (who had NEVER seen it) to view it with me. We went through BOTH VHS box sets in a day! Sure, time has passed and I noticed NOW a lot of the scientific 'errors' but --hey! That's why it's called science FICTION! Taking this too seriously isn't the point. Space: 1999, ocassionally makes you think, cheer and worry about the good guys, and as far as wholesome family entertainment is concerned -- you can't go wrong! Buy it."
1,Poor SciFi and poor story line!,"For science fiction, this set is very poor. The stories are boring. If you want science fiction, get Babylon 5, Star Trek, and others, but not this over rated series."
2,A Scotsman Trying to Play It Like He Knows Los Angeles,"From referring to Santa Monica as ""Santa M"" repeatedly to having his main character claim that he grew up in Los Angeles, Brookmyre is miles away from any reality of Los Angeles. His thinks-he's-so-brilliant quips and cliches are tired and show him to be a dull imitator of greats like Irvine Welsh. The absolte funniest/worst part of the book was his made up translation of an ancient document found on the island of Crete, containing gems such as ""Often have I wondered, watching the rhytons being filled in sacrifice from a quaking beast's throat, would we do the same were it a cold, clear water that issued forth, and not this liquid jewel, this decorative prize?""In the end, Brookmyre's approach is too casual and cocky to be convincing and his prose is sub-par. Save yourself the 10 bucks of buying this book. Trust me."
1,Cheap quality and dim.,"I thought german products are good performance ( even if you have to somewhat sacrifice in reliability ), this thing made in india. During installation, one of the bulb housing fell off, so I use silicon glue to stick it back on. For 80W, these pieces of crap are dimmer than my old PIAA 51W bulbs. Amazon is so nice, they refunded me in full. I recommend KENSUN HID light kit also from Amazon, oh my, big difference."
2,Not impressed...,I bought these to give a slight boost to my headlights on back roads. The filaments are poorly positioned and give a spotty beam pattern. Nor did they appear any brighter than the bulbs I replaced in my 2002 Tahoe.Stick with a well engineered lamp like the Philips Vision Plus or Sylvania ExtraVision and you will be fine.Note: To those of you that put HID lighting in halogen style headlamps in order to look cool and blind oncoming traffic...STOP THAT! Get proper projector housings and be cool for real.
3,"Good quality, features could be better","This is a good quality lock as cable locks go (remember ALL cable locks are a minor deterrent). I bought it specifically to lock bikes to my Thule Hitching Post rack, and I selected the Thule so I could buy matching lock cylinders for this and my other Thule lock. However, this lock does not have a swappable cylinder, which neither Amazon nor the Thule website seem to tell you, so I'm glad I waited to buy a set. It could also be about a foot longer since it's kind of sold for use with Thule racks, and a little more length would be necessary to get it through two bike frames, all four wheels, and the loop on the Hitching Post. Still, it's worth the price if you're aware of the drawbacks."
3,good dive ladder overall,"I have used the Windline on dive boats over the years and the center column and cross bars works very well.For my own dive boat I bought the better built Garelick dive ladder instead. The Garelick dive ladder has a broader step that does a much better job of supporting your foot when all you have on is a neoprene bootie and or a swim fin and are standing on the ladder. The Garelick also has a foam inner core so if you drop the ladder it floats. The Garelick dive ladder has a white coating that has held up for more than 15 years of regular use. I doubt that the ""electro polished"" finish of the Windline will last as long.Overall both are better boarding ladders for divers or waterskiers than the traditional boarding ladders. Highly recommend with any ladder that you try it out on calm waters and with people around to give you an assist if needed rather than wait until it is a sink or swim proposition."
4,Lots of music for little money,"This is a lovely recording. I am surprised by the paucity of more recent, digitally recorded compilations of these deservedly sonic opuses. But if one must settle for an ADD rendering the sound quality of this EMI recording is excellent.The musical interpretation is lushly delicious et tres french, as it should be. The orchestra is crisp and professional.This is a fine addition to any CD collection to round out one's Ravel."
3,Excellent Intro CD,"Sloan's musical variety is perhaps their greatest asset. With the release of their latest CD, Navy Blues, their expertise has only grown to encompass an even wider array of music.Navy Blues - 5 stars!"
3,Not their best,"Even the members of Sloan would acknowledge that this is not their best album. Their original sound is all but lost under heavy overproduction that turned their song into something geared towards the popularity of early 90s Grunge. The end result is fairly dissatisfying, with the exception of a few tracks where true Sloan sound manages to shine through the grime. If you're new to Sloan and are looking for good early albums, I'd stay away from this one. Instead, look for Twice Removed, or One Chord to Another, which are all-time favorites of mine."
4,Can-Rock Classic,"Although this may not be Sloan's best album (most would suggest Twice Removed) it is an excellent collection of songs. Fans of My Bloody Valentine would appreciate this album as it is full of nicely distorted guitar work with light vocal harmonies on top. This album is similar to other sloan albums in that it contains excellently crafted songs but is quite different from other Sloan albums in style. Heavier, grunge-noise symphony replaces their later pop-rock anthem-esque stylings. Definetly an album that's enjoyable."
3,"Contains ""Tammy""","This CD contains the song ""Tammy,"" which comes from the movie ""Tammy and the Bachelor,"" said to be the best of the Tammy movies. The movie was released in 1957. I have not seen it, but the reviews indicate that it was set entirely in Mississippi. Hence the lyrics mention cottonwoods whispering above, a whipoorwill, a breeze from the bayou. I do wonder whether the tune itself, without the lyrics or with other lyrics, really originated with that movie."
5,Just a sample of her wonderful music,"Debbie is best remembered as an actress, but she had a major transatlantic hit, Tammy, which opens this short but high quality collection. Indeed, it is the only reason I bought this collection as British label Jasmine released a twofer that contains most of the songs here and many more besides.The songs are generally taken from the Great American Songbook, though Debbie occasionally recorded country songs here too, adapting them to her own style. Am I that easy to forget (Skeeter Davis) provided Debbie with an American top twenty pop hit. Among the classic songs included here are Moonglow, Hooray for love and Time after time.This collection is dominated by love ballads, but not limited to them, as Aba daba honeymoon demonstrates. If you enjoy music by Peggy Lee, Julie London, Jeri Southern and others like them, give Debbie a listen."
3,Sent first one back,The first cd received wouldn't play through the first song so I had to return it. The second cd that was received is playing correctly so far. Hopefully it will continue to do so.
5,Gershwin Kern Porter,A fabulous compilation 0f music by a wonderful orchestra. Great orchestrations with a remarkable feeling for the composers' music!!! Bravo
1,Paris Hilton? A Remake Of House Of Wax? Horror Film Indeed!,"Dreadful, just dreadful. Look how low we have sunk. We went from Vincent Price and Charles Bronson to Chad Michael Murray and Paris Hilton. That should sum up this film for ya. Rent A Night In Paris instead, that's the best performance we'll ever get from her."
3,Strangely....,"I think the best part in the whole movie was Paris Hilton with a pole through her head... The wax house was very cool, Vincent was really interesting. The acting was...nominal.... but the hack and slash nature of the film probably saved it. Nothing really new except Vincent and the house itself. Maybe it was too bad the cameras didn't get bogged down in the wax more often. At least a gag reel of that would have been worth it."
2,"Good Production Values, Nothing Else New","Elisha Cuthbert must be tiny. Watching her walking between two co-stars in HOUSE OF WAX, I was able to make that observation because the movie has little else to offer most of the time.The production values for a lame slasher film are excellent...but HOUSE OF WAX still plays like a lame slasher film. There's just nothing new here. It feels so by-the-numbers that I felt like I've seen this movie a hundred times before. When it was called FRIDAY THE 13th or the unnecessary remakes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or...take your pick.There are moments but they're few and far between. The rest is just formula.When this movie came out, the producers actually marketed it to appeal to anyone who would want to see Paris Hilton brutally killed--which was pretty much the entire English-speaking population of the Planet Earth.Now that's hot."
2,At least Paris Hilton dies!,Its not that bad - and Paris Hilton does die well in it - we all cheered when she did! The movie is worth a look but i would rent it first and see if you like it. It is better than people have been letting on!
2,Dull and Not Scary,"I found myself pausing the movie and walking away quite a bit. Nothing really new here, nor scary for that matter. An hour in and I didn't find myself scared about anything.I wouldn't recommend watching this."
1,P.U. - Walked out on it.,"They had some elements with good potential and some well defined characters but it just didn't seem to come together.I fianlly got tired of waiting for it to happen and walked out.(This is rare, I can count on one hand the movies I've walked out on.)"
4,It was awesom!,"I thought the movie was awesom!! They didn't hold back on the bloody stuff. It's especially great if you hate Paris Hilton, (she gets killed.)It has really good actors too. None of those people you've never heard of.You are always in suspense. Its one of those on the edge of your seat movies. Definitely a must see."
1,Paris Hilton Go Away!!!!!!!,"This film is a joke compared to the original. And if I were Paris Hilton I would steer clear of being on the same film as Elisha Cuthbert before people wake up and realize that despite all of the hype that Paris Hilton is an ugly racist coked out anorexic moron who's education goes no higher than a ged. She can't act, can't sing, has nothing intelligent to say, and I wish the scene of her demise in this film was real."
1,"it's not a remake,just a rip-off !!!!!!!","this is not a remake,so if you are looking for that,stay away,this isn't a good movie,so if thats what you want stay away!,your best bet,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!"
1,terrible movie,Two reasons this movie is terrible:1-Poorly written and lousy direction.2-Paris Hilton is a part of the cast.
3,HOUSE OF WAX!!!!!,"What do you get when you put a tough chick, her boyfriend, a juvenile guy, and a sexy blonde... you get one of the most surprising slashers of the year!Although not perfect, I was surprised by this movie! Ok.. it barely has anything to do with the original 1953 version or the vincent price remake... but the potential of this movie was there. Bombarded by the many bad revews and the not too bad reviews... I can assure you that this is not that bad. I didn't expect much when i went to see this in the theatre, but as i left the cinema after the movie was over.. i had the urge to watch it again! The reason is not for the story or the script.. simply because i want to feel that thrill ride again! My expectations was in awe!!! The movie has its ups and downs... but the potential and the effort was not too bad!!! Watch it!!! It's worth the ride!!!"
4,movie wasnt that bad,"The first thing people need to remeber is that this was NOT intended to be a remake of The House Of Wax, but more of a remake of the movie Tourist Trap! So I went into the not expecting to much and I was not dissapointed at all. I mean it was far from the best horror film ive seen, but it was far from the worst. The Paris Hilton death scene is not to be missed. All in all its not a bad movie"
3,Better Than I Expected,"Of course I walked in thinking that this would be a typical slasher movie with a little skin from Paris Hilton to spice things up. But in fact I was impressed, first with the camera work which was great. This was a movie of extreem close ups from the first shot to the just before the climax. Next, Paris Hilton was not bad for the role. She held her own and even got me to care for her character. She's not lead material yet but she'll get there with a few more flicks and a couple of good directors to help. And third and most important, the art direction was exceptional. Very cool wax figures, a great creepy town and a really disturbing wax museum made this film beautifully textured. I will definitly see another film by this same team. It's worth the 2 hours."
3,better than i expected,"after the likes of 'white noise', 'ring 2', 'darkness' and 'boogeyman', i really lowered my expectations about this film. the title of the film and the fact that there actually is a house of wax in the film is where the similarities end between this remake and the original. the death scenes are pretty gruesome and paris hilton isn't as bad an actress as i'd heard. i don't like older films, but the original house of wax is definitely a keeper. don't go in expecting the original with this one, but this film definitely holds its own."
4,Special effects,"The story is a bit slow going, though you know based on the title, just what to expect. If you can get passed the idiocy that IS Paris Hilton, this is overall, not a bad choice. The special effects are also great."
3,Halfway decent film,"I have to admit, this movie is really not that scary. There are a couple predictable moments when you find yourself jumping against your better judgement, but beyond that, it's just good makeup. However, House of Wax seems to be unintentionally entertaining. The acting is amusing because it is just THAT BAD, and Paris Hilton's death scene is classic. The sets were pretty well done, and, even though you could see the end scene coming from a mile away, I still thought it was a thrilling conclusion. Overall, I think this film completely missed the mark for horror and drama, but I still found myself enthralled and wanting to watch the rest, which is why I'm giving it three stars. If you're looking for a quality film, which it sounds like some of the negative reviewers were, you won't find it here, but, if you just want a entrtaining movie and have nothing else to do, this is your kind of film."
2,OK,"The begining was not good, when they try and introduce the characters and tell there story. There were some parts where I chuckled, not because there was a joke being told. But after that when the action started I quite enjoyed it. The killings were gruesome and cool. The end with the House of Wax melting down was really cool to watch."
3,GOOD ! but it could've been GREAT !,"Between the creepy atmosphere of the film,the A+ make-up/efx, some torture & a few excellent kills ""HOUSE OF WAX 05"" could,ve been a GREAT new slasher film! BUT the very unrealistic hollywood super-hero big brother character & his ultra lame save the day ending just drops it down a couple of notches from a great slasher flick to just a good slasher flick. Also in respect to the original,calling this film a remake is like calling Tobe Hooper's ""TOOLBOX MURDERS"" a remake!"
3,"Corny, silly, but still worth watching","Most reviewers have already given a synopsis of the movie, so I will refrain from doing so.I love horror movies and have to admit this was one that I did not care to watch. It was at the local video store and I rented it. I will admit, at times, I laughed at some of the 'acting' and thought some of the kills were predictably funny. However, the effects in this film make the movie. There is no laughable CGI that has plagued other movies like Exorcist the Beginning or or that werewolf movie with Christina Ricci. This is the typical slasher flick that's a few notches better than most. It's a fun mindless watch."
1,Few Scary Moments but by and large a stupid film,This film is not without a few scary moments but the acting is so poor (honestly Paris Hilton was terrible) and some of the location scenes so Hollywood backlot that the best parts of the film were shot in low light. The ending was cheap and predicable but the wax casting room was creepy. Several points didn't made any sense and the plot line was very weak.
2,I am more disapionted than anything,"The story line behind this film was actually pretty interesting, the problem is that the abysmal acting and characters just ruined it for me.//SPOILER//The town was built by two crazy brothers killing people and encasing them in wax, and as always a group of teens stumbles across it and that is where things start. Maybe if it had simply had better actors I would have enjoyed it, but as it stood, I found myself wanting these people to die, but not liking the villains enough to want to go for them. It was a lose lose situation."
4,Good,The movie was in really good condition I really lije the movie and it hasent given me any problems so far
5,Surprising,"I wasn't expecting much, but this movie really surprised me with how effective it was. It sets out to creep you out and while you may have seen the same old storyline, this one goes with the familiar and, well, it works! Scary as hell."
3,Watchable,"Not much to say about this one, and although it still grasps some of the mystique that surrounded the original house of wax projects, the film ultimately falls flat. Fun and Scary at times, it has a couple of major flaws.The first one would be Paris Hilton, who plays the role of one of the 20s-age kids who venture into trouble. I would have thought there could have been a much better selection for this role, but I suppose money was tight so they just threw her in there. Of course one actress with a bit part cannot ruin a film, but direction can. This is really just to basic, with the typical Deliverance Mountain hideout style or approach where you have some psychopaths in certain places that seem to get away with whatever they are doing in their world for long periods of time.At times it is engrossing with its cat and mouse games, but in the end it ends up mediocre and predictable."
1,Once again,"Hollywood remakes a movie that did NOT need to be remade. And, ""best"" of all, we get to see Paris Hilton on the big screen (like we're not saturated enough with this empty headed no talent on cable TV, regular TV, newspapers and magazines).When will the torture end?Wonder if there are any ORIGINAL scripts with interesting ideas that Hollywood can buy and make a movie of? (How about adapting books to the big screen?)It speaks volumes when the only movies coming out nowadays are numerous sequels and remakes featuring nominally talented and overexposed Hollywood starlets.Nah, I'll stick with Vincent Price's masterpiece."
1,Would give 0 stars if I could...,"I just finished watching this movie and I can't think of anything good to say about it. The attempted theme seems to be ""good twin vs. bad twin"" but no payoff is offered regarding the theme. I admit I prefer supernatural horror to gore-fest films but even gore can be carried off well with good plotting. The murder scenes in this film bordered upon ridiculous nor was it possible to sympathise or empathise with any of the victims since they exhibited the intelligence and survival skills of bread mold.THe final confrontation is disappointing, unless you like watching an actor and an actress wade, dig, and crawl through melting wax for about 10 minutes. Nor are any of the conflicts introduced in the begining of the story resolved in any way.I much prefer ""Waxwork"" as an example of museum horror. It's campy but still chilling and also a little intriguing."
1,house of nuts,"so what else can u expect in a third grade horror flick..i've seen movies like FRIDAY THE 13 th..kinda stuff and this movie is in no way diferent than those moviesthe common story for a horror movie (or a movie with a serial killer ) :a bunch of teenagers hang out for a vacation sort of thing..with girls in their skimpy cloths kissing the boys and the killer starts killing one by one and one or two from the group manage to outsmart the killer and finally kills him..so this is the story line of the so called HOUSE OF WAX followin the trend of the JASON movies here there r these twin bros who kills their victims and displays them as a wax statue..this movie has some gruesome murder scenes which looks disgusting rather than terrific. so after much hype what parris hilton is doin in this movie ..after all she is just another chick who kisses her boyfriend ,strips and die awfully (the most horrible death in the movie).HOUSE OF WAX ..nuttin new"
4,good movie,great movie and believe me get the LG BH100 blu ray and hd player like me and a 1080p set
3,House of Wax.,"The original Vincent Price movie was incredibly terrifying. Now, they had to remake it. Now, I won't critize it until I see, but why Paris Hilton and those Brittney Spears and Justin Timberlake look-alikes? I've heard some fair reviews about it and I saw a picture of Paris Hilton with tears in her eyes and her mouth was open and she was screaming. She doesn't look too bad! I'm interested in seeing her act and seeing her getting a pole shot through her head. A good slasher movie, maybe. I give it three stars because the movie critic section of my mind has gone on holiday and the movie-going idiot inside is bursting out. I just watched ""Friday the 13th"" and I liked it!I shouldn't ask what is wrong with the person who put Paris Hilton in the movie. I should be asking myself why I want to see said movie!"
3,Not as scary as it looks like...,"House Of Wax is kind of the typical horror movie: the teenagers have a problem with their car in the middle of nowhere and they get killed one by one. The first time is a good movie, just good, but then, you know everything what should scare you, so it's not scary (was it ever scary?). However, it's a great movie to watch at night with some friends, but I think it failed on it's biggest purpose: to scare. Also, all this thing everybody talks about Paris being on the movie, I think she was just an extra, besides, she can't act, and in the cover picture of the DVD ans the poster and everything, Paris appears with wax all over her body...what's with that? I must have missed the part when Paris gets waxed. But there's one thing I can't deny: the special effects were intense and pretty well done.Finally, the story was great, and it was a great idea, but I think the producers didn't take it the way they should have."
2,Generally way bad. But some stuff is cool. SPOILERS.,"Paris Hilton dies, of course, in HOUSE OF WAX, and that's the reason I bought my ticket. I saw the movie at a midnight screening, which seemed appropriate, and I had fun watching it. The acting is cardboard, the plot is ridiculous, and the film bears no resemblence at all to Vincent Price's classic.Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Cuthbert take center stage as twins who find themselves trapped in a ghost town of wax figurines, stalked by a killer. The movie is generally silly. Still, there are several kickass moments in the movie. When Jared Padalecki is shaved and placed in a wax shower, for instance, the film is appropriately gruesome and fun. When the entire set comes tumbling down around the characters, that part is the best. And, as I said, Paris Hilton's death scene is reason enough to buy the ticket."
2,"It's A Remake, But Not Of 1953's ""House Of Wax""","You may be impressed if this is the first ""young kids lost and pursued by psychos"" film you've ever seen. But, since that story has been told so many times ---and so much better in films like ""Wrong Turn""--- you'll be disappointed by this gooey mess. It should be called ""The Louisiana Paraffin Massacre"". And, as has been pointed out by others, the makers of ""Tourist Trap"" ought to be hopping mad at this treatment of their idea. The film is NOT scary; it offers up some gore and ghastly effects (all done very well), but they're no substitute for fear. Plot, logic and sympathetic characters have all been eliminated. Think about it: a tourist attraction wax museum in a tiny town that isn't even on a map? And, the museum itself is made entirely of wax? Please see the 1953 movie of the same name, or the original, 1939's ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (both now available on one DVD), for a real story and entertainment."
4,waaay better than expected!,"frankly, when i heard paris hilton was in this i automatically assumed it would be the biggest heap of cow dung on film seen in 2005, yet i have to admit (even as a Paris anti-fan) this movie was pretty enjoyable. i love good horror movies, especially with good amounts of gore, and this movie's certainly applied for that last department.of course you already know it's not a masterpiece and not a classic by any means, yet i had a blast watching this on DVD, and for all (Paris-hating) horror nuts like me, you'll like this one. if you like blood, suspense and gory fun, this is definitely worth a viewing."
4,Pretty Darn Fun,"This is a good one. The beginning third where we meet the teens who will serve as the victims is horrible. The long, drawn out rehash of all slasher films brought bak in all its tedium. I almost turned it off. Once things got rolling however, it gets really rolling. Pots of gore (some downright nasty), a few good jump scenes and great FX make this a winner. Check it out!"
3,vincent price's remake of house of wax burns deep,"in my review of the 113 min film house of wax here we have 6 friends on there way to a football game and ofcourse take a wrong turn into a town that has been forgotten for years. the people in the town have all been created into wax sculpters but who is behind it all ??? elisha cuthbert , chad michael murray and paris hilton star in this fright featured film and the gore keep son growing as the film goes on by all i can say is that warner bros. and dark castle again have made a excellent remake and i see better remade films later on . not since the remake of house on haunted hill was i impressed amazing special effects and makeup work well done guys ..."
3,Entertaining,"As for an actual remake movie, this movie actually makes a decent and entertaining hour and a half. But don't expect anything more than that because the storyline that is depected in this movie is a little thin. However, the acting that is given my all the actors was actually pretty well done. The best scene in the movie, I thought, was when Paris hilton actually died, although this part for her wasn't to far of a streach since the character is similar to her in real personality in life. But who didn't see that coming, right?In the general sense of a horror movie, this movie is far from actually being scary in the least bit. Although there are some cool murder scenes and a decent amount of blood shed in this movie, I wouldn't place it on my list of best horror flicks. More like on the list of humorous teen horror movies that are enjoyable to watch if you want to see a semi-horror humorous film."
1,Don't waste your time,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting such good reviews from others. Personally I thought it was pretty bad. The acting is horrible and the script is ridiculous. If people really were as dumb as the ""teenagers"" in this movie act, they'd have a lot more problems than just getting dipped in wax. Okay, the movie is good for some laughs, and there is some ""gore"" for those who like that, but I wouldn't waste my time or money watching this again and if I could get it back for the first viewing, I would. One star - and that's only because there is no Zero on the meter."
2,should have been tittled house of crap,"this is a nice boring ""horror"" film with crap acting and a dumb plot if there even was one.even if paris hiltion wasnt in this film it would still suck.. but her bad acting just add fuel to the fire.this movie wouldnt scar a 1yr old kid.its like watching a broken record of all the horror films ever made."
1,Worst movie ever!,"I would just like to clarify one little fact that the screen writers seemed to have forgotten about physics. If you have a house that's all wax, floors, walls, furniture, everything else, exactly how would it burn. You can't burn a candle without a wick, so what was the wick in the house if everything was made of wax? Seems to me that the people who wrote the screen play probably didn't graduate from elementary school! Stay away from this movie unless you feel a complete waste of 1 1/2 hours is worth your time, in which case you're probably as dumb as the screenwriters..."
1,the new face of horror,This is a fine example of why horror films being put out now are true peices of trash.
5,Great Remake!!,I enjoyed this movie much more than the orginal movie. Probably because with the modern background I can identify much more with the characters. The acting and special effects were GREAT!!
2,HAHA,This movie was stupidly funny. The one part that grosed me out was when that guy cut off that one chicks finger with the wire snips. The funniest part was when Paris Hilton had that big stake go through her head. Do not rent this if you want to be scared. Ha
4,Trudy's House of Wax,"House of Wax brings to the screen the story of a group of friends who venture into a small out-of-the-way abandoned town on their way to a college football game. However, all is not what it seems in this quiet town that exists in the shadow of its wax museum...The acting is pretty good, with Elisha Cuthbert (who is gorgeous!), Paris Hilton (!), and the rest of the cast doing a good job.The plot and the setting are interesting, while the dialogues are just average.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."
2,The set was better then the actors,"Ive always like wax museums, it was better then any actors in this snore fest. Paris Hilton is a terriable actress, and i was glad to see her die. Just like Ghost Ship, the speical features are the only thing that saved this."
3,Does well . . .not swell.,The only reason that this movie didn't get 2 stars is becuase all the bimbos and dopes got creamed in the movie. And that makes for a gret horror device. The plot is original. I just hope that next time they refrain from using CGI in place of what should be make up effects.
2,"Thought it would suck, and it did","The only two things in the movie that I could actually say I liked was the set design and the method of killing. The plot was just horrible. I mean horror movies are supposed to have dumb teens, but this had waaaaay too many idiots. The acting was horrible, just horrible. Don't even waste your money."
3,"Wax On, Wax Off","Wax on: I was definitely entertained. Some suspenseful moments, and I must say that I was captivated all the way through. But you've seen this movie before if you're into the genre. Oh, yes indeedee-do...it's the movie you've seen 100 times if your into the genre. The difference between this and all the others you've seen is that the slasher in this flick makes wax sculptures of his victims (that was no spoiler I hope...I mean after all, you get that from the DVD cover, no?).A lot of the typical slasher movie stuff where the cast is putting themselves into situations that any person with half a brain wouldn't put themselves into (you know...going in ""there"" alone, getting in a car with ""that"" guy, etc).All in all, entertaining, but predictable; therefore, the scares are minimized. Not too gory by today's standards of the genre.A rental of this DVD might be more satisfying than a purchase.Wax off."
3,It's OK.,"I just saw this at a dollar theater in my town. A friend of mine who's all into horror movies said that the original was much better, and that this had nothing to do with it at all, really.Either way, I thought House of Wax was OK, pretty standard for a modern scary movie. Hey if nothin else you get to see the super annoying Paris Hilton get wasted (as in killed, not drunk!). It's pretty bloody, but judging from what my buddy says, fans of the original might want to avoid it. I'd watch it again, though."
4,HOUSE OF WAX...NOT BAD,never thought i ever watch a movie with paris hilton in it and enjoy it..yeah the story not great (its a horror movie) but i found it to be entertaining with cool death scenes..better than i thought it would be
4,A surprisingly satisfying horror film,"This 2005 slasherfest 'House of Wax' starring well knowns such as Paris Hilton, is in fact an incredibly entertaining and overall good movie. The plot is thin and there isn't much behind it all, but the visual candy is enough to satisfy all the fans alone. First off, an entire town made of wax. Then the special effects were mind blowing (It's bloody at points). Although the film goes by the typical rules of the average slasher fair, it happens to be better then most. This film blows away most 2005 horror films like 'Boogeyman' and 'White Noise' in my opinion. This is definately worth checking out, although it's more worthy buying used, because it's not a DVD you'll watch too often (Horror movies have little replay value)"
1,Not worth watching,Not worth watching. Wife and kids started watching the movie chose something else 25 minutes into the movie. One of Bruce Willis flops.
3,"Spencer and Bruce good, but need different movie.","Spencer Breslin and Bruce Willis are good together, but it is almost impossible to make an excellent movie out of this plot. They were using A Christmas Carol's plot, but did not even come close to the success of it. Spencer is hilarious about Bruce's job and about Bruce not having a dog, and Bruce is Bruce displaying his acting talents all over the screen, but this movie just did not live up to its wonderful predecessor, A Christmas Carol. It was actually an okay film, giving a good moral and displaying acting talent, but they didn't follow through all the way."
2,Not worth to buy it,"Film producers want to catch the trend and make movies with fantastic stories. This is one of these movies. The effort to be strange and different, makes this story lack of logic. Bruce and the kid player is not good at making their role. ""The whole nine yards"" is much better than that movie. I dont advise ""The kid"" to buy."
1,A great tool for inducing ...!,"Too bad there's no option for zero stars. A 40 year old image consultant with an empty life and a mean personality encounters a kid who is really him, magically transported through time to help him learn where he became such a jerk. God only knows how this laughable concept was deemed worthy of being made.Cliched scenes, poor acting, ... jokes, and paperdoll characters add up to one of the worst movies ever made. No kidding. I was starting to have visions of slaughtering the cast and everyone else involved in making this waste of celluloid.I remember seeing a quote on an ad for this movie claiming it to be ""Willis's Finest Comedic Work!"" Give me a break. I laughed more during Schindler's List.If there is any brain in your head whatsoever, there is no possible reason to want to see this movie."
4,Liked it,I thought the movie was very cute. Glad I purchased it and the seller was great to work with. The movie is dated (about 10-15 years old) but has a very good story line. Glad we purchased it.
3,No Kidding,"This is a fun movie with Bruce Willis going from an overly serious businessman to a guy that can have fun with a spouse and dog. All thanks to his older self sending his younger self his kid self. His kid self teaches him many of the things he had forgotten about his childhood. It makes him realize he is now to tough on himself and those around him. Reminded me of another entertaining Disney movie ""The Blue Yonder"" which unfortunately isn't on DVD yet. In that one a kid travels in time to help his great great grandfather. Overall this is a well rounded family movie and will appeal to most fans of Disney movies or light romantic comedies. Good quality DVD with no extras. Fair replayability."
5,Bruce Willis at his best!,"This movie is a mixture of adventure,fun and to achieve ones wishes.If you have a dream you've got to fulfill it.Bruce Willisacts in his best movie yet!It's a HOLLY SMOKES of a movie.If you've never seen Titanic and you've got it and this movie,you should definetly see this first!"
4,"Very enjoyable, clean, light-hearted fun!","I saw this film with two other adult women with no kids accompanying us, and we all thought it was a great pick for our ladies night out. The film made us laugh and smile, and the plot kept us involved. Not only that, I can now take it home and know that my 4-year-old will enjoy when he gets older.Thanks, Bruce, and thank you, Hollywood, for making a good family film."
4,"The star is really the kid,","and he should be on the cover too... i find it amusing that the kid actors Bruce Willis has acted with almost alwaz out perform him... Spencer Breslin was way funnier than Willis in this movie (the scene with his shrink was pretty funny though), and Haley Joel Osment just made him looked like a stiff in The Sixth Sense. The commentary track by director Jon Turteltaub and Spencer Breslin was really interesting too, cuz u can just tell SPencer'm concentration just drifts away from time to time like small kids usually do (at one point, he couldn't help himself and started eating candy, it was hilarious =8). overall it's a good story well told, i just wish it was someone more vivid that willis started in it."
2,Yawn!,If You're looking for a movie that the kids will love i wouldn't recommend this one. I almost fell asleep in the movie theater during this one. The only way it got two stars was because of Bruce Willis's acting and a bit becausee the kid[Spencer or something like that] wasn't that bad.
5,The Kid,"A truly amazing and entertaining movie...for the entire family....much more to the movie tho' then meets the eye....so rare to find a movie that all the family can enjoy, with fun, depth, and warmth...a good moral story and insight into our own kid and how we view the kid and how our kid views us.....I highly recommend it....."
5,Is this really a kid's movie?,"I love this movie. It's funny and is sort-of about the ""inner child"" without being annoying. The kid that plays THE KID is great, the almost end is great. A perfect ""comfort"" movie."
5,hooray for good clean movies,"i enjoyed this one so much after i'd rented it , i immediately bought it!"
1,"DVD hangs up PHILIPS MAGNAVOX players, too","...Like the RCA and other players mentioned in some of the other reviews, I went through four copies before I had the sense to visit Amazon.com and read the comments. I saw the film in the theater and thoroughly enjoyed this serious look at a modern-day Scrooge. Although this is rated as a comedy and it certainly has its high points, the film reveals an inner struggle that most adults face. We get stuck in ruts and when someone moves the cheese, we have difficulty dealing with it. I recommend the film, when Disney fixes the DVD problem, but not before. Who knows how many other players will behave in a similar manner to the RCA and PHILIPS Magnavox models?"
5,The Kid with Bruce Willis,"This was truly a fun movie. However, The copy I got from Amazon was apparently the ""cut"" or ""abridged"" version. It was shorter than the actual movie and had many scenes deleted. I would like to find the UNCUT or UNABRIDGED version of this movie."
4,Man visited by 8-year-old self,"Bruce Willis is a thoroughly obnoxious image consultant who runs over people like a truck while telling them what they should do to improve themselves. All of his makeovers only involve the exterior of his clients which is about as deep as Willis cares to get. He bullies his assistant (played by the delightful Lily Tomlin) and is indifferent to the girl who is in love with him. Suddenly he begins to see a red airplane in the sky about the same time a young boy appears in his condo. The boy turns out to be a younger version of himself who is not too pleased to see how he has grown up (no dog, no family, and he's not a pilot.) Willis is rude to the boy as first but begins to see that perhaps he has a few things to teach him. He begins to bond with the boy and becomes an altogether nicer person. There are a lot of loose ends in the movie and a lot of things are never explained but it is pleasant entertainment with likeable actors."
2,Poor packaging....,I received this item wrapped poorly causing the center section of the CD holder to break. This caused the CD to rattle around in the case. This is a wonderful movie; I'm just unhappy with the condition it came to me in.
3,Way overpriced,"Please do your research. You can get a tank like this at Petsmart (made of GLASS) for no more than $20, probably less. And with a tank so small, you really shouldn't be that concerned with getting a super high quality/expensive tank. Maybe if you are getting a 55 gallon you should be more concerned. Acrylic and glass have their advantages/disadvantages, and Petsmart actually doesn't carry very many acrylic tanks."
5,"This book is also called ""Practice of Witchcraft Today""","The British edition has the ""Today"" on the end, but the Canadian edition doesn't. It was published by Beach Holme Press (Canada). I think it's a great book, very clear and non-sensational. (I'm a bit biased though, seeing as the author was my father.)"
1,Terrible!!,This is the worst text book I have ever purchased for a class. It is full of errors and is very difficulty to follow. There are not enough practice problems and the answer key does not give enough information as to how the answer came about. There are discrepencies from one page to the next.
3,John Lee Hooker and the Raylettes???,"The Big Soul of John Lee Hooker (Collectables): I do not know who the girl group actually is that is singing behind John in this one but as soon as you hear them, you expect to hear Ray Charles instead of John Lee Hooker. It all works reasonably well but it's odd."
5,Helping hand-literally,"I have owned an ADAPT-A-LAP from the very first time (Mr. Blum) invented it. I have arthritis and my hands HURT. I am able READ books large and small. It adjusts and is extremely portable. And you don't loose your page. I also have the waist strap so I can read in my hammock!!! Thank you, again, ED.!!!(Ps You didn't leave me your NEW PHONE NUMBER!!) ;) I have used it for at least eleven years."
2,Not really worth the money,"It's okay, but not worth the price. It tends to slip and slide on floor or carpet. Not very stable."
5,Great for kids!,"I'm generally not a fan of music ""samplers,"" but opera can be tough to introduce to children. And hey--even adults played cards, ate, and talked through the recitative sections of the early operas while they waited for the next aria! So I feel that getting kids hooked on opera through great arias probably can't hurt (the next 10 years or so will determine whether I'm right or not). My 4-year-old loves this CD; it's a delight to watch her imitate Anna Moffo (the sincerest form of flattery, for sure). Highly recommended resource for introducing young kids to opera. More top picks: Siberell's Bravo! Brava! A Night at the Opera, and the Black Dog Opera Library CDs."
2,Mediocre Sound Quality,"If you note the album was released in 1994, and includes selections from many years prior, you will understand that the quality of the sound engineering is not going to dazzle your ear.It's a very nice collection to hum along to, but don't expect shivers down your spine as the sound quality is not sufficient to reproduce the dynamic range of these voices."
3,"Okay But.... - a review of ""The Most Famous Opera Arias""","My daughter (6 y.o.) and I like opera; but sitting for two hours to watch Turandot is just not within the realm of possibilities for my 4 year old son right now... so I was looking for an opera CD for the car. He will sit and listen to short arias.This was the first we purchased and it is okay but not great.Problem #1 - where is Wagner. No Wagner?Problem#2 - Elena Obraztsova - she sounds like Carmen's grandmother. Rather matronly for a vixen (imho--lol)Three Stars. [C+] Great Price and good sound quality for the car. The operatic styles of some of the performers are antiquated and frilly sounding, but I would probably buy this CD again.Note: We purchased and really preferred ""The # 1 Opera Album"". It has more selections and better artists in our opinion. Also it's a two CD set. Just something to consider."
2,what about being succinct,maybe there are wonderful insights here. The writer does not know how to be succinct. So I wont read past the sample.
1,Yikes.....who lives like this?,"This pair clearly knows what they are doing, but who in their right mind would spend millions to live in a bad derivative of Dorothy Draper and Sister Parrish? Their use of clashing patterns and brilliant color is one step away from a nervous breakdown. In a vigilent attempt to get press (and boy have they), they have masterminded an attention getting style that has kept them on the forefront of shelter magazines for two decades, yet they are clearly the laughing stock of thier peers.Pity they could not do something original AND liveable. Now that would have been brilliant."
1,have bought 2 of these... buckes either break or the screws fall out,SPEND YOUR MONEY on a NON-REVERSIBLE! I will NEVER buy another reversible. I thought that Tommy may produce a better belt... no different then the Walmart versions.
2,'90s grunge movement was bankrupt before it started,"I laugh when I hear people say that Nirvana was the best band that ever was (Ok, so far, you're entitled to your opinion, though I think that this is a very limiting perspective on the totality of music) or ever will be (now waitamminit. Pre-empting ALL future bands? Give me a break.)This stuff is neither the be-all, end-all of music, nor is it even very worthwhile on an artistic level. Many of these out-of-tune songs sound like they were written in five minutes by a very disturbed individual (which, it turns out, Cobain was).Not an album to remember. I also laugh at all the kids that were crying a river and holding all-night vigils over Cobain's suicide, as if he were their spiritual leader or something, or as if his lyrics really MEANT something important. (What the heck do half of them even mean, anyway? Damned if I can figure them out.) Cobain's decision to kill himself was tragic, but jeez, come on, people."
2,Nirvana isn't great; They're iffy,"The lack of production on this thing is really what kills it. ""PennyRoyal Tea"" and ""Dumb"" could've sounded more cohesive had they been produced as well as their Unplugged counterparts. ""All Apologies"" ""Rape Me"" and ""HSB"" are classics, but the rest isn't worth listening to. ""Scentless Apprentice"" is among Cobain's worst songs. So is the feedback squealer ""RFUS"". God, I hate all the praise critics heap on this band, and especially this album. Nevermind was the bands ONLY solid studio release. The rest is iffy. Yeah, that what Nirvana is; they're iffy. Sixteen Stone has better songs than the best material on In Utero, and Bush were trying to copy Nirvana's style! I guess a copy really can be better than its predecessor. Give me ""Glycerine"" over ""All Apologies"" any day. Let the narrow-minded squabbling begin.... NOW."
2,An alright album,This is an ok album. Heart Shaped Box is a great song but theres nothing too remarkable about the others and a lot of it is repitive and sounds the same.
5,2nd best Nirvana album,"This is one the best Nirvana albums of all time. Heart shaped box and all apologies are pure classics. Penroyal tea and Rape me aren't too shabby either. Do yourselfe a favor and order this album, you won't regret it."
5,Very Good,"Well, the album contains some classics as rape me and heart shape box. I likedand indicate the product to a friend."
4,What Else Should I be,"This CD is raw, emotionally and musically. It puts the listener in a challenging place of feeling sympathy for the speaker, yet at times being appalled at his bleakness. That complexity combines with a really hard rock sound to create something moving. This is the emotion and sound grunge became known for."
4,Uh oh.... SOMEBODY didn't like being famous!,"This album is quite bizzare, to say the least. There are several songs that feature nothing but screaming and banging on instruments (""Scentless Apprentice,"" ""Tourette's"") and even the quiet songs are bothersome to the casual listener with their nightmarish lyrics. This clearly wasn't made to appeal to commercial audiences. If you like Nirvana because they ""rawk, maaaan!"" then go buy something else. But if you like raw, intelligent music, this is just the album for you. Don't worry about the fact that lots of stupid people like Nirvana. If the band had any say in their fanbase, those ... wouldn't have even heard of them. In tearms of early 90's grunge, only Pearl Jam can top this. Very good stuff; highly reccomended. Oh, and lots of cool girls like Nirvana... an added bonus for all you lonely guys out there."
4,Rock's greatest follow-up album? (4.5 / 5 stars),"There's not a single rational rock fan on earth who will not agree that Nevermind is one of the most pivotal and influential recordings of all music history. However this jagged, vitriol, ear shattering grunge masterpiece may just eclipse Nevermind for its unrelentled harshness and shear attitude. Korbain's songwritting is just as brilliant on In Utero than any where else (Pennyroyal tea, Heart Shaped Box, and Dumb all exemplify this). The mind numbing force of the angsty rockers ""serve the servants"" and ""rape me"" are enough to make you wet your pants. This album has all the indie street cred and edge of Sub Pop albums like Bleach, yet it has just the right amount of produciton refinement and songcraft that Nevermind contains. This album is a soul shattering classic. Not as important in the grand scheme of things as Nevermind, but it has to be the best example of what Nirvana was as a band and proof of Korbain's musical sainthood."
3,nirvana was not a great band,but if you want one of their cds... buy this instead of their other albums. or if your more open minded DEFINITELY buy the acoustic in new york.
4,It's Been A Long Time But Still Cobain Rules!,I first heard this album around 1995 and i bought it a couple of days after i heard it i still play it most days still.If you like Nevermind or any of Nirvana's Album or even the first Foo Fighters album buy this you won't be dissapointed.
5,Two greatest songs by Nirvana,"This album is equal to Nevermind, individual songs are better onInutero but cohesively Nevermind is more even toned. Heart Shaped Box and All Apologies are two powerful pop songs that could rival any in the history of rock. Other standouts are Rape Me, Pennyroyal Tea, Dumb and Francis Farmer. Unplugged is still their best but NeverMind, InUtero and Unplugged in NY are a must as are Bleach, Incesticide and Muddy Banks.Their should of been more it's a shame."
5,Cobain in your face yet again!,"Considered the next biggest Nirvana release since Nevermind in 1991, In Utero is truly Cobain at his best. Better known for its singles, Heart-Shaped Box, Rape Me, and All Apologies.Be sure to listen for the bonus track, Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through The Strip. Also take not that some versions of the album have this track hidden, while on some others you can just skip to it with your CD player. Even though the bonus track sounds like it was made up on the spot for a good 7 minutes and 33 seconds, it doesn't effect the rest of the album in any bad ways.The only down side I can mention about this CD is that the lyrics for the bonus track, and ""tourette's"" are not what they seem. But there's always the internet if you want to look them up."
5,"Brilliant, driving, spontaneous.","This album is just as good as Nevermind in my opinion. It's alot more crazier this time though. Every song gives me goosebumps when i listen to it. The best thing about are the awesome guitar and touchy lyrics. Best tracks ALL OF THEM. Here are a few. Serve the Servants, Scentless apprentice, Rape Me, Heart-shaped box(cool video), dumb, Milk it. Tourette's and All apoligies are my two favorite off the album."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS NEVERMIND,"NEVERMIND will always be NIRVANAS best record,this is still a great album but just doesn't match NEVERMIND.It took me a while getting into this.The album is much heavier which i don't prefer but it still has a soft side with the brilliant""DUMB"" AND ""ALL APOLOGIES"" the album has moments of brilliance with""HEART SHAPED BOX""(EASILY ONE OF THEIR BEST)Track 4 (""francis farmer"" AND ""PENNYROYAL TEA""This is still a fantastic album by NIRVANA which is a rock fans dream,so buy it"
5,Great. plane and simple.,"This probitly won't get posted because it's breaking the ""writing guidelines"" but starla pasis from IL U.S.A needs to shut up. Kurt Cobain is great. Any insult to him is an insult to me. The music is great. get it."
5,the product of genius,"okay, kurt may have been trailer trash at heart, but there is no denying he turned the tide against the beatbox music of the early '90s. and of course, the genius that produced this also produced the self-loathing and destructive mythh that everyone loves about the man. buy this, as well as the manic street preachers' ""the holy bible"" in order to find the true beauty of what it is to be angry!"
3,yeah!,"Ok, you made songs about courtney love but that was it! i don't wanna hear no more your songs! the vocals are terrible!"
4,Nirvana's Big Sellout,"This is the big sell out album by grunge kings Nirvana. Grunge, a ripoff of the goth movement, hit big in the 90s, making heavy metal, etc. mostly passe and cheesey with a huge camp factor that when Nirvana got big, THERE they were past their prime just like that. Key tracks are: Serve the Servants, Scentless Apprentice, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me & All Apologies. Wheras theatrical bands like King Diamond here hit most by the grunge movement, Judas Priest were forced to admit they're gay just to stay alive and Metallica forced to change their sound. After the 90s was over most of the big grunge bands had a dead lead singer."
2,Strictly for METAL MANIACS,I bought this cd after Nevermind and was quite dissapointed. Its a little too heavy and you feel like takin' a break after every song. All those who have already bought UNPLUGGED will also be dissapointed as some of the songs are better in their unplugged version than they are on this one. Overall a dissapointing work after NEVERMIND.
2,The Next Quiet Riot...,"Wake up, people! Nirvana were destined to bargain bin heaven with this album, before...well, you know what happened. Everybody is so blinded by the hype that surrounds this band that they can't think for themselves. This album is okay, but does it really deserve 5-star status from over 80 Amazon reviewers? I understand if you need time to think about that one--but THINK!Hey, put down that copy of Spin!"
2,It has to be said..,Nirvana is one of the most overrated bands in history. many people say that this cd is filled with anger and pain and emotion but there really isn't much of any of that present. Do you want a cd that will show you what real pain and real emotion is while probably freaking the hell out of you and all your friends? Would you like to listen to a cd that is truly original? Then go listen to Last Rights by Skinny Puppy all the way through and tell me how In Utero compares.
3,much better than Nevermind,"ok i admit it. Nirvana is not a talented band and yes they DID rip off Soundgarden. Their music is also very trendy. however, this album has more texture than the boring 4/4 time scale nevermind. this album also has a harder edge and less teenie friendly lyrics. ""dumb"" and ""heart shaped box"" are the best. Radio friendly is also a good song. ""milk it"" is a whiny but hard hitting song. ""Very ape"" is very..well... very ape. ""tourette's"" is the fastest song and shows the band's appreciation for punk rock. buy it if you want the best nirvana."
2,The music is not that good.,"This music is not that good. There are explanations and theories galore, but the end result still being that this album is a painful listening experience.Incesticide is a better Nirvana disk. Prime time Nirvana songs are basically ""Pop songs"" tainted with a jagged spray paint streak through them (aka Sliver, Son of a Gun, Molly's Lips)In Utero is slow. In Utero has minimal clever melodies and is basted in shrieks, feedback and painful jabbing noises. It's doctored with intentionally sloppy production, a high as a kite Raw Power Iggy Pop would have rejected. In Utero is depressing. It's contrived, over conceptualized, self sabotaged and vocally mangled. ...not exactly repeated listening material for my ears. (It is also over rated and over played.)Buy a Jesus Lizard album instead."
2,I dont get it,call me un-mainstream but i never got the hype surrounding Nirvana.. There music is soo simplistic!listen to Soundgarden or Alice in Chains for real ROCK music
3,Not getting the big picture,"Everybody is entitled to their opinions,but i don't get the big deal about Nirvana.This is the only Nirvana album i own,but i'm not a big fan of it.Its alright,but as far as the being the best band of the century,they kinda get on my nerves after a while. Foo Fighters Rock!"
1,better than nevermind,"this is better than nevermind, but still stinks, don't mean to be harsh but i like music with good vocals and guitar solos. try bands like queen, the who, even judas priest and iron maiden. all those bands were light years ahead of this."
1,Simply the Worst,"The other day a cat got jammed in my fanbelt when I was driving down the street and it sounded better than this abysmal album.The irony is that Nirvana...for all their phony anti-establishment nonsense...is nothing more than Britney Spears or Ashlee Simpson (or really Johnny Bravo from the Brady Bunch) talentless hacks who just so happened to fit the costume when the record industry was pushing their latest money making scheme....in the early 1990's the new fad was ""I hate my parents; being a loser is cool"" rock. To say this album is awful is like saying eating human dung makes your breath unpleasant.Honeslty, give your money to the CIA before you buy this album...at least they torture for a purpose."
1,I GAVE IT 1 STAR CUS IVE ONLY HEARD 1 SONG OFF THE ALBUM,"I gave this 1 star because ive only heard 1 song off the albumI didnt hear the song that well, it was blasting in a furnaceRunning into telephone pollsThis album just isnt very good, ive only heard 1 song off the album though, but if i may quote some lyrics""Hay! What?!Ive got a rude complimentOnly looking out of my heart shaped box!""THose lyrics Cobain wrote arent very good, someone needs to tell this guy to get his head together"
1,This CD was rather stupid,I'm 14 (using my mom's account) and this cd was dumb! maybe if i was high i would like it more but i didn't like it very much. I'll stick to Linkin Park and Papa Roach! And yes i do own this cd. (Nirvana-In Utero) I might b the only one puttin it down but when u get this cd u will put it down unless tha is ur a druggy cause it's mainly tha kind of music.....Hope you like my review. 100% true. Lata.............I'm out
5,The best record Nirvana ever made,"Although this was not as commercial as 'Nevermind' 'In Utero'was a huge songwriting leap from 'Nevermind' and generally, shall we say,more angry than it's predecessor.Cobain's ability to draw in the listener was still there as was his hatred for the MTV audience he despised.In utero was basically a record about his life, Never had a star like Cobain laid himself so bare.For example Heart shaped box was about his love for his wife, 'Serve the Servants' was about how his father had let him down,'All apologies' was about the dissapointment he had for himself and in 'Dumb' it talked about getting high (a subject Cobain knew all to well).The bottom line is that if you don't already have this album then buy it otherwise you'll really be missing out."
5,Best album by Nirvana ever!!!,"This album has it all!! Nirvana, the band which lead and still leads the music business even though no longer tangible, brings you their best on this excellent release. Cobain lets his frustration and dizziness out so that it can rock your living room. This CD is the greatest ever!!! Buy it! It is worth a million dollars, and you can get it for 13."
5,Nirvana's best elements combined,"As I said, this album combines all of Nirvana's best aspects and serves them up on a platter. If one was to make a Beatles metaphor, I think this is Nirvana's ""Sgt. Peppers"" album because they were going into avant-garde territory and Kurt wound up making a piece of sonic art with ""In Utero"". This was the first contemporary cassette I had ever heard and it touched me because this album has a very human and vulnerable sound that's very rare to hear in music. Even in the harder songs, the humanity is so evident and strikes something internally that can't be denied (this isn't just nostalgia talking ha). These songs are all 5 out of 5 and flow like a body of art.Some people won't understand songs like ""Milk It"" or ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"" or ""Tourettes"" but that's ok. Some of the best things created don't make sense.If you don't own this already, buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Can I Give 10 stars?,"Nevermind was nothing compare to In Utero. ...In utero is just the best Rock album since 70's and it s not limp or other bands in 2001 who can pretend be as good as Nirvana - In Utero. A real band, a real suffering, a real personn, a real soul. A man, not a marketing product. Stay real."
5,Best Album Ever,"In Utero is a perfect example of Kurts talent. Nirvana is my favorite band and this is my favorite album. Each song is great in its own way. But if i had to pick the best songs they would be: Serve the Servants, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, Frances Farmer, Milk It, Pennyroayl Tea, and my favorite song on the album, All Apologies. Buy this album. No mater what price you pay for this album, it will be a bargain."
5,My Favorite Nirvana Cd,"I have had the chance to listen to Nirvana's 3rd studio album at a whole, and I have to say. This is a fantastic release from a great band. Nirvana couldn't have released a better followup to another groundbreaking album, Nevermind. This album is full of great songs such as Pennyroyal Tea, Heart Shaped Box, Very Ape, All Apologies ect. This album is worth a listen if you like any of Nirvana's other releases or want to hear the band's later sound. Kurt Cobain's vocals and guitar are top knotch, Krist Novoselics bass playing skills are amazing, and Dave Grohl is one of the best drummers I've ever heard. This album was well produced with Steve Albini's recording skills. Overall, you get a lot of talent in one cd. I recommend this to all Nirvana fans or punk/grunge fans. Thanks for reading! Enjoy the album!"
5,Its Great (What the hell does walffes )Means Lol (My Name is not maria),"This ver. of In Utero is no differ (In my reflection this could be the best album of Nirvana's collection) ,The Only differnces is walf me and the new sound cleaner better penny roy. tea ,and this has more of a Bleach feel than a Nevermind feel ,Milk it reminds me of Paper cuts .Get this one is cheaper they took away the dead fetuses on the back no changes on the lyrics cotent .Just Get It .rock music today is horrible supposely punk but little girl voice EMO ,so get this album it will shine down"
3,Not that bad,"In Utero is not that bad but isn't that great as Nevermind . But without them , we would not have bands such as Limp Bizkit , KoRn , Offspring , Green Day , Marilyn Manson , Smashing Pumpkins or any other bands like that . The point is Kurt Cobain is dead but his music isn't . He made alternative music popular and if it wasn't for him , we would not have bands like Offpsring today . The album just has some good songs in it only"
4,Hell,"This album is very strong, but it's almost like ""Nevermind"". In my opinion ""Heart-shaped box"" is one of the best Kurt's songs. I like all songs from this album."
5,ta da!,"my favorite nirvana cd for some reason.... buy it, its really good, a little cynical but if you like that type of stuff, you will love this"
3,"A Few Hits, Nothing More....slightly overrated.","I was a little disappointed with this album. Nirvana had an excellent album with, ""Nevermind"" and I think they peaked with it. This album has: ""Rape Me, All Apologies, and Heart-Shaped Box"". I really enjoy these songs, but not too crazy about the rest of the album. Give it a listen and you decide!!!"
4,GOOD CD!,"Of course it's not as awesome as ""Nevermind"", but it's still rocking! Many songs you didn't hear that you should of. ""In Utero"" is absolutely a great CD!"
5,my favorite from Nirvana,"I like a lot of the stuff they put out, but this is easily their best. variety and honesty of songs did it for me; this is a more honest view of what the band is about than Nevermind was (though of course that one is good too). A little uneven in places and kind of odd sometimes, it is nevertheless a classic album and a must have for any Nirvana fan. If you want to get into Nirvana, get this and Nevermind. Enjoy!"
1,Click Click Boom!!!,I wouldn't let these greasy unwashed no talneted f$@&s pump gas into my car. Cobain reminds me of Lars Ulrich in that he wanted everyone to feel sorry for him. MTV sure helped them fill their bank accounts. The only thing I regret is that when Cobain offed himself in his garage was that his junky wife wasn't there to follow his example.
1,What a sorry excuse for music,"Hey, fan from Fetcham, England.... I'll take Britney Spears or the Spice girls any day over this convoluted self-indulgent piece of trash. The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't give it no stars. I mean, I guess the cover of the CD is descent, and ""All Apologies"" is ok, but the rest is just awful. Thankfully, we are finally getting out of the trendy angry-depressing music that Nirvana introduced to the mainstream. If Dave Grohl would have been at the helm rather than Kobain, Nirvana would have been a good band. But if that sorry piece of scum was still alive, you wouldn't hear ""Nirvana's the best band of the 1990s."" You'd here, ""Ahhh, Nirvana's just another Soundgarden,"" which they are, except Soundgarden's better. This CD is just plum awful. Please don't buy it. It is deconstructive."
1,Wrong fans wrongly believe could do no wrong...,"Everyone says Cobain's a genius. OK, Prove it. Where's the proof that he supposedly is of above average intelligence? Just because you wrongly believe he could do no wrong (wow! See? I can do a play on words like Kurt! I must be a genius too!) doesn't mean he's worthy of the god-like status his suicide catipulted him to. The In Utero production is horribly muddy, and yes, after rethinking it, Kurt chickened out at the last minute and called up Albini to try to fix it, but Albini couldn't re-engineer anything he engineer in the first place. The songs are OK, but the most pretentious thing is to try to be unpretentious, so I guess Nirvana is the most stuck up hick group in the west. Whatever. Nevermind."
4,i've become to accept this album,"nirvana in utero an album most nirvana fans would say it's too heavy were's the ""teen spirit"" well i'm not the first to say they're not real fans because real fans look passed the ""teen spirits"" and look to the smple yet mesmerising ""dumb"" ""all alpogises"" then the loud rif-tastic ""serve the servents"" radio friendly unit"" and the single ""heart shape box""kurt really has a go with the lyrics this time writing some really heart felt words which would shake the world on april 8th 1994 even though he probaly died on april 4th or 5th april 8th was the day kurt donald cobain the leader of the grunge group nirvana was found with a supposed self-inflected shotgun wound too the heada classic that the record company didn't like too much because they wanted another nevermind and to sell millions of records but in the end they got a challenging raw punk rock ""grunge"" album that stands the test of time as a all time classic"
2,In Utero,"After four years owning this album, I still can't get used to it. I'm not sure if it's the walls of feedback and really lame solos or if it's just Cobain's bad screaming. Maybe it's a combination of all three. There are a few standout tracks such as Serve The Servants, Rape Me, Heart Shaped Box, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea, and All Appologies.Less than half the album is worth listening to. If the other seven tracks were equally as good as the five mentioned above, I think we'd have a decent album on our hands and I could write a good review for it. But unfortunately, the rest just seems to be repetative screaming and feedback...and even though I grew up with grunge, I still can't get used to the drivel on this record. Save your money."
3,Little too abrasive,"This is a pretty good album, but in my opinion, Steve Albini has never done anyone's album any good. The production sounds abrasive, and the songs are a little too spare. If that's what Kurt was going for, fine, it just isn't as enjoyable. The songs are still very good, and though I have my complaints, it's still a good album."
5,what the...,"first off the album's a classic, and if you want to listen to Nirvana the way Kurt intended, get this CD over the more polished (way too polished in some cases) Nevermind.Now that I said that, let me for a second laugh at the dufus who stated that 'Heart-Shaped Box' is written to kids with cancer. What are you talking about? That was a love song to Courtney about, literaly speaking, a HEART-SHAPED BOX collection she had. All Apologies was the only thing written towards a toddler and that was to his daughter...This is what happens when 10 year olds tries to be 'cool'."
4,The sound of a soul in torment,"Kurt Cobain hated fame, but did nothing to avoid it. He was trapped by his own heroin-fuelled self-pity and his damaged childhood. He lived in pain from a psychosomatic stomach complaint and was married to Courtney Love - which must have been a pretty extreme experience.This album is the loudest suicide note in history. When Kurt wanted to call the album 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die', he meant it.I bought this incredible prolonged howl of despair when it first came out, and Kurt's suicide just seemed inevitable. An amazing artistic statement, but like a Van Gogh or a Tchaikovsky Symphony, the product of an undoubtedly disturbed mind."
5,This is the best cd that nirvana has ever put out.,"This is the best cd. It is a little depressing but kurt cobain really showed the best of his ability to write lyrics. I would have to say this is the best cd nirvana has ever put out. I think that maybe its safe to say that this is the the best cd put out by any band. The lyrics are not to explicit because most likely people that are not old enough to listen to this music wont get the meaning of the lyrics anyway. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to turn the volume up just a little more to get the plesure of hearing somebody say, ""Turn down that noise."""
2,This is NOT VERY GOOD,This is definitely close to one of THE WORST nirvana albums out there. This is NO Nevermind which was the god of all Nirvana albums.
3,Smashing Pumpkins are Better.,Siamese Dream would wipe the floor with this.still an ok cd.Rape me...do do do do
2,In Utero,"In Utero is Nirvana's follow up to their highly success debut Nevermind. Quality wise In Utero is about the same as Nevermind, a fair album from a fair band. Highlights include: Heart Shaped Box, and Rape Me. If you enjoyed Nevermind I'm sure you'll enjoy In Utero."
1,DISGUSTING,"TERRIBLE CD DISGUSTING SONGS STUPID LYRICS NIRVANA'S WORST EVER I HAVE HEADACHES WHEN I LISTEN TO RADIO FRIENDLY UNIT SHIFTER AND MILK IT I HATE DUMB TOO IF YOU ARE A NORMAL PERSON THAT DOESN'T LIKE BIZARRE AND DISGUSTING THINGS, DON'T BUY THIS CD, OR ELSE YOU'LL BE LOOSIN 20 BUCKS IT'S BETTER GIVE THAT MONEY TO ME THAN BUY THIS CD I'M A GREAT NIRVANA FAN, I HAVE ALL THE CD'S AND I RECOMMEND BLEACH AND SPECIALLY UNPLUGGED THANK YOU"
1,That heroin-induced drawl makes Kurdt's slurring so godly,"In Utero is total bullsh*t masquerading as something intelligent and creative. With a mixture of embarrassingly pretentious lyrics, and horrendously bad playing, anyone with some amount of reasoning will be able see that this isn't the masterpiece the reading material in your local grocery store magazine rack says it is. The online rhyming dictionary can make better plays on words than Cobain does. But then again, nobody slurs their words together with that heroin-induced drawl better than ""Kurdt"" does."
1,POP,"The people who give this album good reviews show that they know nothing about the nature of music. Even someone that has a rudimentary knowledge of scales will see just how poor and simple this album is. If you like Nirvana, you have no right to critisize todays mainstream pop. It's no different. Please, someone tell me how this is so great and innovative? Power chord changes, incredibly simplistic and repetative bass lines, etc. What am I missing? You wanna see some real guitar playing? Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Slash, Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde, Leo Kottke, and Tuck Andress to name a few."
1,I'm hate MTV because they introduced me to my favorite band,"I'll start this off without any words of respect for MTV, which I hate with every fiber of my being. If it wasn't for MTV, I never would have been introduced to Nirvana. I insist on being ungrateful to the corporate machine that is MTV. I hate how MTV introduced the beautiful and heartwrenching ""Heart-Shaped Box"" to me. I also hate how MTV introduced the revolutionary ""Teen Spirit"" music video to the world. I especially hate that MTV has given me hours upon hours of free programming and music videos over the past two decades. That especially bites. The reason why MTV is such corporate swine is because they sponsored, televised, and released the fabulous MTV Unplugged in New York Nirvana gig. That gig was the most awesome sight I've ever beheld, but since I hate MTV, I'm angry Nirvana agreed to do it. Oh, how conflicted I am"
1,Just another 90's depress me album.,"This is just another run of the mill massively overrated 90's depress me, dead classic. Also you will hear the opening of the gates for gay-radio-mainstream no talent soulless nu-rock bs we have today."
4,"For all you ""young-uns"". Hah.","I enjoyed this cd alot. Every song is unique and carrys a message to everyone unlike alot of groups now that have songs that all sound the same. And to the people that think this is the future of music, sorry this died a long time ago. Nirvana's music inspired alot of music today, but the times are changing and unfortunately Nirvana's sound wont be seen in the future. And the young-uns label is lame I have to tell you. Young or old, I think many know Nirvana and appreciate them for their music. Go buy the CD if you haven't, its a good listen."
4,In Utero,"First off this is Nirvana's 4th studio recored album. It was my second Nirvana cd and i personaly think that its great. However i dont think its Nirvana's best. I recently perchased Bleach and Incesticide(Nirvana's third album), and I really enjoy those two and would suggest those over In Utero. Some highlights of the album are Heart-Shapped Box, Rape Me, Dumb, and All Apologies. I think that Dumb and All Apologies are way better live though. But I enjoy listoning to all of the tracks. I would suggest this ablbum to anyone who likes Nevermind."
5,Nirvana's best cd (in my opinion),"I would have to say this is Nirvana's best cd,even more so then the overrated ""Nevermind"" (which I truly love,but you have to admit it's overrated)."
5,It gets under your skin...,"'In Utero' is quite possibly the best album of the nineties. The entire cd (save a few of the interior tracks) is filled with beautiful, pained, and inspired emotion in song-format. You can listen to the whole thing and feel energized, depressed, enlightened, and a whole slew of other emotions all at once. I guess this is just an album that you can ""feel"". Highlights of 'In Utero' are ""Heart-Shaped Box"", ""Rape Me"", ""Dumb"", ""Pennyroal Tea"", and ""All Apologies""; however I never skip a track when I play this.'In Utero' is completely different from 'Nevermind'. It's less angry and much darker. Cobain exposed so much more of his mind on this album than on any other. I think the lyrical content alone is more powerful than a heavy guitar-riff. Instrumentally, 'In Utero' proves that simplicity is power. Everything sounds great, period.This is a soulful artistic masterpiece, you won't be dissapointed by anything on it."
4,two thumbs way way up,"a fantastic cd, and i highly recommend it to anyone that likes good guitar riffs, haunting lyrics, and blistering vocals. at points it veers into mindless noise, but it fits perfectly. 2 thumbs way way up!"
4,"1/2 Great, not all good like Nevermind","This CD has some outstanding tracks like:Heart Shaped BoxRape MeDumbAll Apologies (not the live one uve heard on the radio)Frances FarmerVery Ape (why does everyone say this sucks!? its cool! could easily be on nevermind)anyways, besides those tracks, the rest are kinda mediocre, Milk It is pretty good, the chorus is real cool, but its a bit too boring for me, Serve The Servants is OK but the chorus is very lacking, Turrets is cool and hardcore but sounds like filler.Bottom line, this CD is worth it for those great tracks and the rest is still listenable.But be warned! its not 100% perfection like Nevermind! I got Nevermind first (im a new nirvana fan) and I was totally blown away that every song rocked. This one is good but a little disapointing."
3,.,"couple of great songs, couple of forgetable songs , of course there are a couple of misconceptions that I would like to dispell. Mainly the idea that Kurt was the sole orignator of having a song start soft and end hard and go back and forth. ANy fan who belives this only proves why they think nirvana is the best; their knowledge of classic rock is sadly minimal. The idea of contrast can be traced back to Led Zeppelin's 69( and even farther back, try the WHO) release. Babe I an gonna leave you follows the same format, of course this was some time before nirvana ever fromed, but i guess this shows that kurt some how convinced jimmy page to follow that format. Sounds pretty dumb right ? so does the idea that nirvana is the end all best of all time , they had a lot to say and that this and Nevermind( though not bad albums) are the best and make everything look like crap ."
2,"Without Stian Aarstad on keys, music strength turns to noise","Turn on your blender, gargle glass, and chant something supposedly evil and .... you have just duplicated (NOISE)= this album. Although keyboards are prevelant throughout, strong melodic chords that Stian used to create power in previous albums are no longer, and neither is this review of a totally weak album!"
2,Maybe I don't get it,"I am having a hell of a time figuring out why Nuclear Blast is marketing Dimmu Borgir as black metal. This is crappy death/thrash metal with synths and mastubatory guitar solos. Do yourself a favor, and buy a Burzum, Darkthrone or Limbonic Art album, not this commercialized trash."
3,Not Dimmu Borgir's best,I really like Dimmu Borgir but this cd I am not too sure about. I think the recording quality is horrible. It sounds like they recorded this album with a tape recorder. I cannot hear the guitars at all in it. The drumming however is amazing. I can tell that the cd had potential is it wasn't recorded so badly. If you want a good Dimmu Borgir cd get Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia.
4,Outstanding Black Metal album!!,"I'm your average metal/rock fan,I try and spend my money wisely,most releases are on CD and they are expensive.I took a chance on Cradle of Filth and it payed off!So,Dimmu Borgir play the same type of black metal I took a chance on them and Oh,lucky me!It's a great album!You can call these guys a poor mans Cradle of Filth but they really are good.Heavy on the keyboards and setting a hellish atmosphere that few can match,good vocals.Tracks that stand out are ""Grotesquery Conceiled"" and ""Arcane lifeforce Mysteria"",not for the faint of heart but if you like COF you'll like these guys."
5,SBD,"1 classy black metal album. The opener reptile blew me away with soaring keyboard melodies and an actual chorus, which is an almost unheard of in many other black/death metal groups. A must buy for anyone with a slight interest in this genre, as this is a prime specimen and deserves a place in any metal collection."
5,Classic Black Metal,"this is a awezome cd black metal at is best! fast,melodic,and evil this is the best album i have heard this year."
5,LORD OF THE NOCTURNAL FLAME,I dont have this CD yet. But its a sure five star because they are truly THE KINGS OF BLACK METAL. And they wont let me down
3,wedding reception,"""Gimmie a C"", gimmie a BOUNCY C!"" Good tunes to crash a wedding reception in the mid-west with."
1,WHAT A BUNCH OF PANSYS.,I HATE BLACK METAL.I LOVED THEIR FIRST ALBUM BUT THEY REALLY REALLY STARTED STINKING SINCE THE RELEASE OF GODLESS SAVAGE GARDEN.SO GUYS UNTIL YOU PUT OUT ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE FOR ALL TID YOU HAVE LOST THIS FAN.
1,Boring!,"This is what I call ""one time listening album."" You listen to it once and never want to hear it again. It's well produced, well played and arranged but it's just awfully boring. FOR ALL TID was so much more primitive but it had its special atmosphere, this doesn't have it at all and it SUCKS!"
3,"Good Songs, Lousy Production","This CD was a cool change of pace from my other more brutal black metal CDs. But the talent of these musicians is done a disservice by the lousy production(especially with the blast beats), by the usually reliable Peter Tagtgren."
1,no good,im fan of this band but this cd is not what i usually enjoy. Is not similar to atmospheric melodic as cradle of filth's album: cruelty and the beast.
3,"Good Songs, Lousy Production 2","First of all im not a fanatic black metal fan (i like only Cradle of filth - Dimmu Borgir and Rotting Christ). I have all the albums of Dimmu Borgir and this album has Good Songs, but Lousy Production that its a little bit annoying. Its not so good as their previous work but its far better than the first 2 albums they have released. Its a must for Dimmu Borgir fans (and people who like keyboards wiht metal -> the keyboards in all their albums are fantastic)."
5,Dimmu Borgir's best,"I used to think Enthrone Darkness Triumphant was Dimmu's best album, but after listening to Spiritual several times over, it has since become my favorite. Satan was a big topic in Enthrone, but he much less of a role in this album, only three songs mention Him. There are beautiful, sweeping keyboard/piano melodies by Mustis to offset the harsh guitars of Astennu & Silenoz and the inhuman vocals of Shagrath. Also making his first (guest) appearance is the operatic-like vocals of Vortex, just before he left Borknagar to join Dimmu permanately on bass. The best show of all these great elements is the 7 minute plus The Insight And The Catharsis."
4,Superior Black Dimension,"This cd is worth buying if you love your black metal with a great melody and beat. The way the synthesizers are used to create an eerie feel makes Dimmu Borgir truly unique. If you're unfamiliar with the music of bands like Emperor and Dimmu Borgir, you might want to listen to some samples first and see if you can appreciate the vocals. If you don't mind Shagrath's intense vocalization, you will like this cd."
4,Great Norwegian black metal....,"Well, I had been looking for Enthrone in stores for ages and gave up, and I bought this one. I was very impressed (though not entirely shocked) with the quality of the music on this cd, and the great black metal on it. The riffs and guitar solos are great as well as the keyboards, even the sung vocals on Reptile. True, this isn't a ""Enthrone"". There's no ""Spellbounds"" or ""In Death's Embraces"" on here...nothing quite as memorable...but it's still a great cd. I just need to get Enthrone Darkness Triumphant."
5,A Real American Breakfast,"The Jamison's have done it again. They have another hit book about food. Notice I didn't call it a cookbook. It surely is a cookbook but it is so much more. This book is a blend of great recipes, nostalgia, and beautiful pictures. This brings you back to a time in our lives when we ate breakfast as a family instead of a fast food drive through. Those smells that you used to wake up too seem to resonate from the pages. The recipes have been good for me to get my family together for those week end breakfasts once again. Also, we have week end guests quiet often and it is so nice to have such a variety of recipes to choose from vs the usual breakfast stand bys. In this time when we all seem to be sreaching for comfort foods, this is the best cookbook I have found."
2,Disappointing,"This book was highly rated, and we love a good breakfast. I was soooo disappointed when I realized three of the pages had been torn out. The price was quite low, but it still should have been noted. I returned it, but as many books as I buy, I've never had this happen. Seller should have checked."
2,not for the everyday family breakfast,"While this book would be perfect for someone who owns a B&B, its just not practical for weekday mornings for a family of 2! It is very informative, if just a bit snobbish; With the exception of several pictures all together in the middle of the book, it is just black on white, with very small print. Also, unless you have at least a bit of experience, I can imagine it would be frustrating and time intensive. Its probably not the thing for you if you like a ""coffee-table"" cookbook that allows you to salivate just by looking at the pictures, making it much more likely that you'll try them out."
5,Breakfast any time of day works for me...,"This book is filled with great recipes that make your smile as you eat. Highly recommend.Janet Sue Terry author of ""A Rich, Deliciously Satisfying, Collection of Breakfast Recipes""."
2,Quit working after one week,"My 4 yr old son received this item for Christmas last year and was thrilled, he absolutely loved it, that is until it just quit working after one week. We tried replacing the batteries, etc., and could not get it to work again. Now he just has a ""hard"" stuffed animal. I probably should have taken it back, but since I had ordered it online, I was unsure if I would have problems. My son was very disappointed,as he wanted this toy badly. Since the price has dratically dropped, I debated getting him another one, but after a review from another consumer, I am hesitant.Maybe Disney ought to rethink and get involved with their defective toys. It doesn't matter where it was purchased, it comes from Disney."
4,So you wanna see how it all went down???,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith had me entranced and I think it was more because of all that has transpired between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. I did not see this film in the movie theater. I watched it on DVD and I could see how in the beginning of the movie, they were cold and distant from one another, as where by the end of the movie, they seemed to be very much connected. I like to see the Director's cut.However, I thought the premise of the movie was cute, especially in the high speed chase on the freeway and they were having a get to know you better discussion and everything seemed all new as they were shooting at other agents. This movie has comedy, action, adventure and romance.Vince Vaughn is hilarious in this film, from what I understand he did a lot of adlibbing in this film...."
2,"All sizzle, no steak","Granted these are pretty people, particularly AJ, but in the service of what, God only knows...despite lots of fun 'sposions and stunts, this movie goes nowhere fast. The last third, or so, really drags...lest I forget though, Vince Vaughn is a total hoot in it, providing much needed comic relief and entertainment value...."
2,Standard Hollywood Fare,"If you like your movies to be full of whizz-bang escapism, no major storyline or ponderables then this is the movie for you. Plenty of guns, action, comedy, good looking stars, and Vince Vaughn adds his usual spark of comedy. But in the grand scheme of movie making it is pretty much a throw away item, a good example of the current Hollywood movie making standards. Turn on and dis-engage brain."
2,CHEMISTRY LEFT IN THE ACTOR'S TRAILER,"Unbeknownst to each other, Mr and Mrs Smith (Brad and Jolie) are assassins, very good assassins. They met ""on the job"", fell in love, and got married but kept their murderous alter egos secret from each other. Now, however, they don't like each other very much. When they both have the same ""job"" to do, their animosity turns into violence toward each other. MR AND MRS SMITH had good potential as a story but instead devolves into is a slick but pedestrian and superficial shoot-em-up. And you know what? I didn't sense any on-film chemistry between Brad and Jolie. They must have left their passion for each other in the actor's trailer before the shoots. MR AND MRS SMITH reminds me a little of THE WAR OF THE ROSES, a much better film about marital conflict that gets physical, although, of course, the plot lines are not that similar. Brad is always cool, but I don't get all the fuss over Jolie: she bored me as did the film."
2,"Get a Clue, Hollywood. We're Smarter Than That.","With Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hollywood proves once again that they think moviegoers are all morons. This boring, ridiculous movie offers nothing other than two attractive people to look at. In an age where smart, stylish spy films like Mission: Impossible and the Bourne Identity have added flair to a tired old genre, Mr. and Mrs. Smith takes viewers back to the 1980s when the most ridiculous of the James Bond movies were fashionable. This film is so poorly written and badly directed that I couldn't find anything positive about it. Despite bullets flying and cars exploding, I found myself falling asleep over and over again. This is nothing but a rehash of everything you saw in the old cheesy action films of 20 years ago with nothing fresh or interesting added at all."
2,Unrated review,"Amazon seems to be mixing together reviews of this product and the regular, unrated version of it, so I will say right off the bat that my review is for the Unrated DVD edition of this movie. So please don't vote it unhelpful just because Amazon put it in the wrong place!Basically, the unrated disc is a waste of money. For one, ""unrated"" only refers to less than a minute of previously cut footage from the big love scene. But for some reason, the people who cut this version of the movie actually cut OUT scenes from the original DVD -- scenes that actually added to the plot, whereas none of the restored scenes do. This is quite aggravating. In addition, none of the extras make this DVD worth owning. They should have made this cut of the movie available on the original DVD release instead of giving it its own release. This was an obvious ploy to make more money, and I'm quite sorry that I fell for it. Here's hoping my review keeps you from doing the same."
2,nada after all the hype,I was expecting a lot more out of this film after seeing the previews.It was really a stupid film based on a silly storyline. Special effects with nothing to hold them and most definitely no real bystanders standing by in scenes. There weren't any police or security guards or everyday people standing by when the Smiths were shooting up everything everywhere. It's a romantic dream that only Pitt and Jolie would share. I was impressed with Jolie in Taking Lives & have now went back to my original opinion of her starring in surface movies where the acting is at a minimum. Same with Pitt. The special effects and shoot-em up scenes were continually one after the other and the cute lines fell flat.
3,Let's be real here...........,"Fun and fast paced movie, but not one of the best movies ever made. Sorry Brangelina!"
3,Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"This movie was cute, it kept my attention, plus I love Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I hope I spelled their names correctly."
2,****Yawn**** They could've done *so* much better.,I must admit though:-Interesting the first and second watch through-Grows stale by the third and fourth-Hot celebrity couple-Lots of tension-Chaos-Intriguing premise-Not worth the bother-Don't even rent it unless You're obsessed with this pair-Spend the money on a pizza instead-Very bland and average-feeling2.5 stars.
1,A real silly movie! Too much action & too little plot!,"A real silly movie! Reminds me of the Spy vs. Spy cartoon in MAD Magazine. I saw it on Cable and switched channels half-way through. There's such a thing as TOO MUCH ACTION in a movie, and on top of it, it had very little plot! I wouldn't have paid a dime to see it at the show or to rent the DVD."
2,Another True Lies? NOT!,This poor attempt at re-creating the magic of True Lies fails miserably. Both Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are extremely stiff in their roles as the stereotypical upper-middle class couple in appearance that are secretly government operatives. Of course their next sanctions are each other. Their attempts at murdering each other is way below the caliber of The War of the Roses and Vince Vaughn plays a poor version of Tom Arnold's character from True Lies. The special effects pale compare to any of the Charlies Angel's films or even True Lies which is about 15 years old. Better to wait for this one to come to cable than to waste your money on it!
5,"Love the movie, even better in blu-ray",I love everything about this movie. Vince Vaughn didn't have a large role but he was funny. Brad and Angelina play well off each other. The blu-ray video and audio quality were reference. The surrounds were used extensively. One of my favorite movies on blu-ray.
3,"Good, but too predictable !","A good rollicking , fun movie ( if you like to pretend) Pitt and jolie display the good repore' that was present when they first fell ""in love "".A bit too predictable, but kids will get into it !"
4,i like it,i like it it's a good assasin movie about a couple in love. great chic flic. or for any couple.
5,Great entertainment,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Angelina is stunning, and Brad is surprisingly a good comic actor; he has the right timing. This movie was funny, very sexy, and full of action and some surprises. Good fun and entertainment for a movie night-or if you're fans of the couple like me."
4,Pitt and Jolie work well together,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It turned into a kind of witty action movie that fit well with Pitt and Jolie's acting styles. To see the domestic disputes and life right in the midst of their oh so private secret life was fun. Vince Vaughn's character, although short lived, was a great addition to the movie.Spoiler. But, my only problem, is how is it possible to sit in a little shed and not have them pepper the thing with bullets? Additionally, how did they escape alive? I mean, there are thirty people surrounding this little tiny shed that is right in the middle of nothing. The people are behind it, to the sides, above it, I mean they are everywhere, and yet they can't get them? It fit together a bit to easily and could have ended in a much more feasible way.Other than that, I thought this was a fun movie. I would recommend."
4,pretty awesome,I liked it because it made sense in a way and was really funny at moments it'd be interesting to see a part 2 in near future to see how they evolve the characters and action scene.
2,Stick to the Original Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"The original version was a goofy, if not plausible action movie with a semi-romantic twist. As one would expect, the original had decent character development for a film of this genre and excellent plot pacing.The unrated version is simply choppy, lacking cohesiveness in the plot and failing to engender any sympathetic or comedic connection with the characters.I had expected the original version improved by a few DVD-only scenes. Wrong. This version is less not more."
4,Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"Very well done and quite suspenseful. Story line was believable and fast moving. Most enjoyable. Jolie,"
3,Very Disappointing,"I was hyped for an experience more like ""True Lies"". What you get here are a few very poorly executed car chase scenes, a few vignettes with lots and lots of guns, very poor dialogue - and a plot line that is non-existent except to set up the next gun battle. A very very frustratingly disappointing movie."
2,Dumb and dumber,"Two bankable stars. One, beautiful, with full pouty lips, and the other one, Angela Jolie. And, yet, the movie she and Brad Pitt made together just didn't click. Once again, a director, Doug Liman in this case, takes a so-so script with high-budget stars and covers up its failiings with lots of explosions, gun fire, car chases, and dead bodies by the score. The banter between Brad and Angela was contrived and only occasionally witty. The fight scenes were utterly fake and the ending was straight out of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but with less realism. Fortunately, I went into this movie with low expectations and, much to my relief, they were met."
1,POOR AND THE BAD MOVIE,"POOR AND BAD MOVIE..DONT BUY THIS ...BUY CSI , 24 HOURS , MAGNUM PI AND OTHER MUCH BETTER STUFF ."
2,"Silly, unrealistic, shallow!","This movie actually kept me interested up until the two main characters blew each others cover, after that it got sillier and sillier by the second. Classic Hollywood nonsense, obviously aimed to the eyecandy oriented viewers. There is no message here, there is nothing based on real life, there is only silliness after silliness. Overall: BORING and BADDDDDD!"
1,A Real Disappointment,"A Brad Pitt fan, I looked forward to this movie.After viewing it, it was one of the few movies I put in my discard pile.The plot was very thin, the special effects and noise were too much, and the overall impact was utter disappointment."
3,"This release only has some additional ""unrated"" footage","I already bought the first release of the movie and liked it. I bought this unrated version thinking I would see more of Brad and Angelina ""together"" - but there's really only 30 seconds or less of extra footage of them..oh well :-|-"
3,Mr. & Mrs. Smith Movie,"This movie is entertaining and a good watch the first time. I bought it because I enjoyed it so much in theaters, but the second time all the suspense was gone, so definitely not a movie you can enjoy over and over again."
3,It was a good movie,It ws good but it just makes me mad when I think that his movie broke up Jennifer and Brad
2,Silly.............,"Aside from the two attractive leads there is little to recommend this film. Certainly not the story. Two killers married to each other, keeping their respective careers a secret until one day they're contracted to hit the same target. Then trying to figure out if the one is trying to take out the other. All fluff and eye candy. And the ending that has moments akin to Butch and Sundance..........well it's just silly."
1,horrible,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I usually will see a movie to it's end good or bad, but this one I just could not sit through.Jolie, in this role, is not believable in any stretch of the imagination. She just does not come across as tough enough to fight her way out of a paper bag. Pitt on the other hand handles the part in his usuall way of handleing this kind of role. The inconsistency in this production was the only thing that made it somewhat laughable. Of course I have to remind myself of the fact that there is a magic formula in Hollywood. All you have to do is put two sexy superstar actors together in the same movie and the rest will take care of itself good or bad. I say no thanks. Nothing to do? Watch paint dry rather than view this movie."
2,Not what I expected,"I received this video and it looked okay. No visible scratches on the back or anything recognizably wrong. However, there are spots in the dvd that will pause and not play without skipping the scene. This was very disappointing because the seller said it was fine. I hoped that they would have been able to tell me if there were any issues with it. Oh well."
2,another cut up dvd,"well how about it kiddies another cut up dvd courtesy of hollywood.to many cuts not to go unoticed for me. MOSTLY ANGELINAS SEXY SCENES,i would hope you noticed the trend in the cutting of movies once they leave the theater."
3,Mr. & Mrs. Smith was good but not great,"The movie began a little slow, but then picked up and became action packed at the end."
2,Bad movie!,"Bad bad bad! Leave your brain at home. In fact, don't even waste your time. I want those two hours of my life back, please."
3,Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"The movie was O.K. I think people hyped it up to much, so when I saw it I was expecting this wonderful movie and got just an O.K. one."
2,Oh dear!,"I'm a fan of beautiful Angelina Jolie. The face is still there and the lower legs, altho skinny. The rest is matronly and tightly corsetted. The plot is dated and clumsy, the action also. Much is made of the use of computers, but it is obvious that they are add-ons - not really integrated into the story.The magnificent DVD ""So Close"" exemplifies modern high tech action in which computers are fully integrated into the story. Shu Qi is the perfect high tech heroine: lovely and lithe, great both in acting and action."
4,love n bullets...always go hand in hand.,"Another testimonial why I think when people are married it's better not to have loaded guns in the house. Okay apart from that, I loved this movie. Especially the ending scene. The acting sux, but then when two of the most beautiful people in hollywood are in a movie with explosions and sexual tension, was anyone really paying attention to acting?I'd wait till the price hits $12.99US to buy it.What's is about? A hubbie and a wifey who really don't know each other. Talk about unoriginal.Action - 4/5Acting - 1/5Angelina - 5/5Total - 4/5"
4,Over the top but entertaining,"Doug Liman is currently one of my favorite action directors and this mvie doesn't disappoint. On about the first quarter of the movie when Pitt and Jolie's married couple discovered each one's identity, there is a very refreshing memory of Danny DeVito's War of the Roses that occurred to me. It was the best part of the film, when one lead is counting the other's footsteps, you don't know exactly what will happen. The OC's Adam Brody is in here, and he pretty much played the comic goof he is in the TV series and did his part well. Its not that movie even needs more laughs, between Pitt and Jolie, the movie have enough of that amusing comic factor in it."
4,More than just fun,"I think most people believe this movie is good amusing fun. I actually do believe there is a little more to it. Its the hard to describe something that seperates the ok movies from the good films. The not so subtle commentary on domestic and suburban life is wittier and more profound than i'd expected. I came away thinking i'd gotten something more than the mindless fun i was looking for, which really made it worth the time."
4,Fun With Brad and Angelina,"There's no shortage of screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in this action-filled romantic comedy from ""Fair Game"" director Doug Liman. In fact, the gunplay, fisticuffs and chases remain secondary to Brad and Angelina's considerable star power - a rarity in today's cineplex environment. ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2005) is refreshingly old-fashioned in the classic Hollywood tradition."
2,Is this movie serious or what?,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith has all the elements of a summer blockbuster. Pitt and Jolie are beautiful people with great chemistry and there is a lot of action. Unfortunately, there is no plot or no common sense to this movie. I didn't know how to take it. Is it supposed to be a realistic spy story? Is it a cartoonish shootout? I just don't know. How can a couple that love each other try and kill each other then make love in the next scene? Hard to care about the characters when the act in 2 total opposite directions. How can I take the plot seriously when Pitt and Jolie single handedly kill 100 armed killers by themselves? There is no bad guy, there is no plot. Just a lot of violence and confusion."
2,Same old story,"Dreadful from the beginning. Vince VAughn is the only bright spot in this poorly done, poorly cast movie. Story line is dull and the movie takes forever to get going. Pretty Boy Pitt as a killer, not so much."
1,A waste of time.,"Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this."
2,Lots of action,"Lots of action, little to no plot lead to an action packed stunt filled not so good of movie.Mediocre. Far too much unstylish gun plays, and the fist fight between Pitt and Jolie was not so stimulating. They are supposed to be the world's top assasins, and they fought more like amateurs. Don't even want to compare those fight scenes to some of the better Hong Kong action thrillers or even James Bond or Charlie's Angels had more graceful looking action choregraphy. The massive explsion of the house, and the highway chase scene were relatively impressive. They should have done more high-tech stunts like the one when Jolie escapes from the window of a high rise building. Perhaps the director didn't want to put his stars through any heavy-duty stunts since it's not a serious action movie to begin with."
1,If I could I would rate it minus 1 star,"I was trying to watch this film to the end, but I almost could not do it. The biggest problem with this film that there is no original story line, absolutely ""0"" chemistry between Brad and Angelina, acting talent also equals to zero. Cheap all the way through, don`t waste your time. It`s a pitty Brangelina got paid for making this film... I should have got paid for watching it. Don`t fall for old Hollywood tricks. Make up your own mind... and rent another movie."
1,This movie is the Pitts!,"It is a shame that a great talent like Brad Pitt is teamed up in a mumble dialogue with Angelina Jole. This movie has absolutely no plot or story line. The action scenes are just noise and have no sequencing that even resembles a believeable scenario. After watching Brad in ""Troy"", it was hard to believe this is the same actor. His movie partner is an actress? They tried to base this movie as a comedy, but nobody is laughing. Don't waste your money, even if it is a ""pre-owned"" DVD."
2,Excellent Video and Audio Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.Both the 2.40:1 (or 2.35:1) video and DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio are excellent in this Blu-Ray movie. I have not complaints about the audio or video quality.The movie is full of action, but I found it boring anyway. Some movies I wish would never end, but I thought the end of this movie couldn't come soon enough."
3,Mr & Mrs Smith,"As for the movie's story and theme, it was good. I am writing this more to talk about the quality of the DVD. It slowed down and stopped in around half a dozen places, but restarted and continued on it's own. Overall, considering the price we paid, it was a not a bad deal."
1,"Boring and hopelessly silly,","No really..not only was it silly but couldnt even get a chuckle out of me...just watch ""war of the roses"" or ""ruthless people"" if you wanna see hubby and wives go at it."
3,ok movie,this is an ok movie but not the best movie that mr pitt or mrs. julie did before. it was a boring movie.
4,Movie Arrival - Mr & Mrs Smith,"The DVD arrived. I have watched it and works great and I can not believe this site. I wanted to note that this DVD had arrived at my home In Saint Louis, Missouri. Yet it requires more input on the DVD"
3,Mr and Mrs Smith,"'Mr and Mrs Smith' is a light hearted action/comedy. OK the plot is pretty bad, it has a rubbish ending and it may be a touch too long (all reasons for my 3 stars), but it wasn't trying to win any Oscars and is a fun, fairly innocuous, way to spend an afternoon. There are some funny moments, loads of action scenes and plenty of eye candy for the boys and girls. Some people seem to rate this film based against all others ever made, in that contest it will never win. But as an example of light entertainment it doesn't do too badly. Not brilliant, but not terrible either. Worth spending an afternoon watching when you don't want to think too hard.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Just fun stuff!,"For simple fun, you can't beat an actioner about a husband and wife trying - for most of the film, anyway - to kill each other in the most creative ways. Jolie and Pitt have real chemistry, regardless of what the tabloids might tell you, and Mr. And Mrs. Smith allows Pitt to flex his considerable comedic muscle. This is the best civil-war-under-the-same-roof flick since The War Of The Roses; it's light, fast, funny and visually appealing - and the combatants survive both each other and one of the campiest, most over-the-top shootouts I've ever seen. Suspend disbelief, and this film is a very satisfying fun-fest."
3,Not as bad as I figured it would be,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is about as mainstream as mainstream action fare can get, and is more notable for being the first on-screen pairing of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie than it is for anything it offers film wise. Pitt and Jolie star as an unhappily married couple who soon discover that each other are assassins working for rival organizations, and each one has the other set in their sights. Yeah, you all pretty much know the premise by now, so there's no need to go any further in that department. What really sets Mr. & Mrs. Smith apart from other mega budget fodder is the energetic and sometimes electrifying direction from Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity) and the heat and chemistry demonstrated by Pitt and Jolie, but there's really nothing else here to make it anything real special. Also featuring the always scene stealing Vince Vaughan and Adam Brody."
4,4.5 stars,"Pretty good movie and though I dislike Angelina Jolie, I have to admit, she did a great job. Ditto for Brad Pitt. Though a little over violent (not a kiddy movie), Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a good story line. Two secret agents from opposing sides are married and they don't know each other's secret lives.... I would see it again."
1,Not worth the time and money...,"Overall a bad buy! Horrible DVD mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that don't work. The movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it, but nothing really ""finished."" The extended scenes aren't scored, which is really distracting because I couldn't stop thinking about the great ""Mondo Bongo"" song that should have been there during the alternate ending, et al!Don't bother with this one... check out the Directors Cuts of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (amazing!) and ""King Arthur"" - they're both very worthwhile."
2,Pretty lame,"Kind of exciting, but how in the world can a married couple not no that the other person in the marriage is a spy. How lame."
5,"A very Sexy, Gunpowder-filled movie","Since this was the start of the romance between Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie, it only seems fitting that it would be an all out assault on every viewing member's wishes (Sexy Woman/Hot Guy, an endless hidden cache of weapons, exciting life, deeply in love when death seemed certain"
5,Great Movie,This movie is action packed and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really click together in their roles. Jolie is amazing as always. I recommend this movie to all.
2,Disappointing,This was not a good movie. It was really lacking something...so much that I couldn't even finish watching it.
1,Terrible movie,"I was just watching this movie and it is terrible. There's nothing but a lack of plot and I'm so bored by this movie that I just stopped watching it and didn't see the ending. This has to be one of the first movies's I've seen that I didn't care to see the ending. Anybody that gave this movie 4 stars only gave it because of Brad Pitt or seeing Angelina Jolie. Well, that and some action. I'm a fan of action movies and movies with lots of violence, but you gotta have a decent plot to go with it to make it a great and enjoyable movie. Be smart and don't see this movie or if you do see it, rent it before buying it and you'll be happy that you saved the money. If you want to see some really cool movies, check out Heist, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Swordfish. Now those are some good action movies with great plots."
1,Just Bad!,"This movie is just plain bad! The action tries to make up for a horrible script full of holes! It means to be exciting and fast-paced, but i found myself dozing off only to be awakened by a loud noise. I went in thinking this movie was to be taken seriously and possible. None of this stuff could happen. Do yourself a favor and never ever see this movie!!"
1,So stupid and cheesy!,"I knew this movie would be cutesy, but I didn't it expect it to completely insult the viewers' intelligence. Bad story, bad script and bad acting. Even Vince Vaughn, the very best part of this film, can't save this mess.Want to see a truly funny and clever dysfunctional marriage film? Watch ""The War of the Roses"". WAAAAY smarter with much better acting.Really, I'm surprised the critics didn't totally trash this one. It's really, REALLY bad."
1,One of the 10 Worst Movies Ever Made,"This movie is billed as a romantic comedy action film. It's not romantic, it's not funny, and if action means gratuitous violence, then it has that. One of the worst pieces films I have ever seen.It probably goes without saying, but neither Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie can actually act. If spouting your lines in an expressionless monotone is acting, then anyone can be an actor nowadays.Nothing in the movie is plausible and if this film doesn't insult your intelligence, then you don't have any. My wife and I turned it off about 3/4 of the way into the movie because we just didn't care what happens to the two main characters. Hopefully, they are killed off."
3,[blu-ray] best version of the movie so far...,"owned two different copies of the DVD.the blu-ray shows more lush colors and detail throughout the movie. the audio is outstanding; when the Smith's house blows up, i hear objects land throughout my 5 speaker system that i didn't hear with my DVD version.recommended if you like the idea of 'upgrading'."
1,I Hate It When....,"I HATE IT when studios call their Double Dip attempt an ""Unrated"" cut. If you are calling a movie unrated, it should be because you replaced things you cut that had to be cut to make a certain rating. If the rating didnt change, then you shouldnt use ""Unrated"". They are killing that term. It used to mean something, now it just means ""Buy this other version for 4 more dollars""."
3,Not bad,"This movie is not bad. I'm not a star fan at all, but for some reason I can't sit and enjoy this movie knowing that if this movie wasn't around Brad might still be married to Jen. I think Angelina is a good actress, but when I watch this movie I feel very disappointed in her. I really can't sit threw this movie with out those thoughts going threw my head. So I don't enjoy this movie."
2,The sparks fly,"What an incredibly boring movie this would have been without the electricity between Brad and Angelina. This is a pretty typical shoot-'em-up spy caper, with some amusing bits in the therapist's office as the two go for marriage counseling. But the sparks fly the minute these two get into the same room together. Otherwise quite predictable--definitely for an evening of very, very light entertainment."
2,what a snoozer,"one word....BORING. the only reason i give it 2 stars is because brad looked hot, as always!!! the only movie with jolie that i've been able to watch in its entirety is ""taking lives."" and it wasn't all that great either."
3,"It paid to wait (for me, anyway...)","I almost - *almost* - bought the original Elektra single disc DVD, but didn't when I found out about the directors' cut. Then I bought the 2-disc one. Unfortunately, not only Fox, but every studio wants to double-dip anymore. It's going to be a matter of withstanding temptation. If you can hold on for a few months, it'll pay off in the end and you'll get the all-the-bells-and-whistles movie you SHOULD have received the first time. This will be my first time seeing the movie, so I can't give it a rating anything but in the middle so far. I feel sorry for those who paid for the first version, really."
1,Save Your Money,"They should have named it Mumbles......What a no plot, unrealistic, mindless waste of time."
4,Fun film based on a highly unlikely premise,"Some films and books are fun to watch and read even though the basic premise is unrealistic and even absurd. The viewer/reader needs to put logic aside. There is an old Yiddish proverb that applies, ""one doesn't question stories."" This doesn't mean ""don't ask questions about it."" In fact the opposite is true. One should question everything one sees and hears and never accept something based on faith. What it is addressing is the recognition that in stories, fables, myths, parables, and the like, the narrator is purposely basing his or her tale on an absurd notion that one should realize and never forget is absurd, but nevertheless not allow this fact to destroy or even minimize enjoying the work. All of this applies here for the basic premise that the spouses of a loving couple could not know that the other spouse is an assassin is highly unlikely."
2,Too fantastical a fantasy,"Some spots of witty dialog save this movie. But unless you enjoy fight movies with no attachment whatsoever to reality, this one will be hard to swallow. Angelina's well known emaciation really shows here--- she looks as if she has muscle wastage, so it's hard to believe she could knock out legions of professional assassins in hand to hand combat. The usual trailer-load of bodies is left behind but Brangelina, of course, are barely scratched. The last fight sequence was 10 minutes of 20 men shooting at them with face to face semi-auto rapid fire, but Brangelina ducked, somersaulted, & spun effortlessly away from every bullet to sashay away into the sunset. It was so ridiculous what measured enjoyment I had from the beginning of the film was completely lost. A weak plot and a slightly disturbing view of marriage all add up to a so-so rental. I wanted escapist fantasy, but this was so absurd I felt the writers, producers and fight choreographers were just plain lazy."
3,For a good time...,"Check this movie out. It's not one of those deep, inspirational movies that will make you think. This movie is just a simple, fun, action packed movie to sit and enjoy.It has the right mix of action, comedy, and the bit of romance that is shown and needed to enhance the story. The main characters are portrayed by two people that seem to fit those characters perfectly (Pitt, Jolie) and the small role played by Vince Vaughn is just pure comedy relief at the perfect moments.I recommend this movie for just the pure fun time it is. Yes it can seem slightly boring and drag on at times, but what movie doesn't?"
3,Pitt Candy,"I hope they are happy together. Because if this is the choice of films to do as a couple. Kill me now. Both good actors, Why this one . I like the roll of savior of the world better."
3,Just OK...,"This movie was not quite as good as the previews of it had led me to expect. It was not a bad movie, just not a great movie. It has good special effects, but I thought the story could have moved along better than it did. I found parts of it very good and a few parts kind of boring, if you are big on ridiculous gun battles you will probably like it, can't say Brad or Angelina really shone in this one though."
3,Love and marriage,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a light-hearted action comedy of no substance. It's the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac combo meal. The Smiths are both suprisingly amusing, Mr. Smith particularly charming. Mrs. Smith's an ass-kicker in the vain of Lara Croft. The movie's pace is very quick and never lets the viewer get bored. It's worth the couple dollars it costs to rent it.Just don't watch this movie if you're hoping for anything original, creative or mentally stimulating. Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a blow-em-up movie with a few witty one-liners, nothing more, nothing less. If you just want to sit back and enjoy a good (over-the-top) car chase or gunfight, get it. Not that it's the best action comedy flick out there, but it'll do. McDonald's doesn't make the best hamburgers but sometimes they really hit the spot.[It's really a 2.5 star movie, but I've rounded up rather than down]"
3,"So wildly derivative, I lost count .","I especially liked the Butch & Sundance & War of the Roses bits. This is a star driven flick. Unbeknownst to each other they are rival paid assassins. They have been married for five (or six) years. When they find out & are going after the same target, you know what will happen next. An action movie with lots of laughs. The only thing serious is the amount of $$$ they made to do this. The chemistry between Brad Pitt & Angela Jolie is genuine since they were getting to know each other real well off screen. What a deal. It's not art, it's a flick. Enjoy"
1,Unable to view,"I was trying out a logitech Review settop box and was unable to view this title. it would stop to buffer for 1-3 seconds 2 or more times a minute. That made viewing impossible. I could have handled longer buffering at 5-10 minute intervals, or lower resolution, but this was unacceptable."
3,Interesting,"It was OK, I didn't really like it much, I mainly bought it to see what it was all about since making this movie Brad Pitt of whom I love as an actor left his wife. I wanted to see what triggered his unfaithfulness to his wife.M"
2,Kind of Silly,This is one of those flicks that was overshadowed by what was happening between the two leads off the screen. It is a below average action flick that tries unsuccessfully to be funny. The only thing that made it a blockbuster was the off-screen affair between Pitt and Jolie.
5,"Smart, funny, and yes, SEXY","Never has an actor and actress have more chemistry and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Their chemistry and an entertaining script give readers more than just eye candy. I haven't enjoyed a Brad Pitt movie in years-might be as far back as 'Seven'. Going in to see this film, I wasn't expecting funny. This movie is indeed that.The movie starts off with two assasins attending marriage couseling. (That in itself is a hoot) and quickly escalates to bond action freezy when the husband and wife are ordered to off each other. Any more than that will totally be giving the story away--but this movie is a definite must-see."
3,It should have been so much better...,"I think this movie could have been so much better if the storyline and writing were better. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are fun to watch together, but after a while, the movie gets to be a little boring. The action scenes pick up the movie a bit, but when the movie ended, I thought it was too long and that they wasted an opportunity to have a really clever, slick story. I know a lot of people really liked this movie, but this is just my opinion - it wasn't as good as it should have been."
4,Review for the Blu-Ray,"I think this is a great movie. Just FYI, the Blu-ray only contains the theatrical release and not the uncut/unrated version that all these other reviews are describing. I kind of think it's ridiculous that both versions were not included in this Blu-ray."
2,Could have been much better,"Definitely some nice chemistry between the stars and certainly some good dialogue but overall, an unfortunately boring movie.There are one or two scenes that are well written, there is some cleverness in some scenes and Vince Vaughn is fun whenever he is on screen, but there's not a lot more to this movie. The entire movie is based on one premise, and the one unfortunate consequence of that premise. No side plots to entertain you or distract you. The boring and plodding dialogue far outweighs the witty dialogue.Finally, just as I have no idea how to end this review, the writers had no idea how to end the movie."
3,Many hats,"When I sat down to watch this film at home, i put on my romantic comedy hat for a nice evening. But as the story progressed, I had to put on my spy hat, adventure cap, my drama hat and eventually my sonics hat. This movie has it all! Not to spoil it...but Mr. and Mrs. Smith are really Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.I did feel, that the movie was lacking in a strong political stance. I mean...where does this movie stand on current issues? This is imporatant to me, and it was not covered. 3 stars and no more."
2,Just ok,"I didn't think this movie was that great. I give it two stars because I enjoy both the main characters, but other than that it was not worth seeing."
1,Good Movie but not on your PC.,"There's a warning from German Heise online that the German release of this DVD has a rootkit like copy protection program that is installed without the user's knowledge and certainly without their conscent. This is particularly scary in light of the Sony Rootkit that has compromised so many computers worldwide. Several are researching the possibility of the US versions having this same draconian rights management software.Thank you Warner for a great movie but, I won't be buying or renting the DVD."
1,Dull and Just Plain Bad,"The only reason I give this movie even one star is that it may be watchable with the sound off due to the gorgeousness of both stars, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I like Brad Pitt as an actor and I admire Angelina Jolie as a person. But this movie had to have some of the worst dialogue ever written. The story was totally unbelievable and just plain dumb. The best I can describe the story is as a poor very cheap imitation of True Lies."
1,The worst movie I have seen,"One of the worst movies. Some reviewers say that it is simply funny movie which doesn't ask you to think. I like some funny relaxing movies. But this one is cheap, plot is straight and again cheap. Joli's performance is becoming cheaper and cheaper since she got Oscar for supporting actress nomination. Such kind of movies worsen the taste of the audience, denigrade it - so, in years the Americans will watch only dummy movies."
3,"UNLESS this ""Unrated"" edition shows little Shiloh Nouvel actually being conceived...","UNLESS this ""Unrated"" edition shows little Shiloh Nouvel actually being conceived, I HIGHLY doubt it deserves the label unrated. Maybe ""Deluxe Edition"" or ""Special Edition"" would be more accurate. I am really tired of these unrated edition DVDs having VERY little extra violence (IF any) and almost no extra nudity, two of the main subjects that often cause the MPAA to give a movie an ""Unrated"" rating. Just to use an example, if the filmmakers had decided that Showgirls would play much better with a PG-13 rating, so they made the necessary cuts and then when releasing it on DVD did a PG-13 and an Unrated version, THAT would be different. How about more truth in advertising and less taking advantage of the customer?"
1,A very silly movie.,"I believed that the average rating for this movie of four stars indicated that it would be good fun. It was not. This movie was like a bad video game. I am annoyed that I wasted two hours on this movie. I kept expecting something clever or interesting happen and it never did. Even the moments of interest in the movie rated only three stars. There was absolutely no attempt to develop the characters and, although something interesting probably could have been done with the main premise, it was not. Instead of trying to develop any suspense, the director chose to have yet another ridiculous shoot-out. This movie was a huge disappointment."
2,The joke wears thin,"Any movie that relies on a single ""punchline"" or a ""One trick pony"" for a full 2 hours usually wears thin and this is no exception.By about 55 minutes my wife and I were saying to each other..... ""OK, this has gotten old already"".I have to admit though we liked Brad Pitt in this movie which was surprising since we have never thought much of anything he has done since Interview with a Vampire.He is one of those popular actord who you always wonder why he is such a press magnet since most of his films have been medicore."
3,Everyday Marriage Issues,"I saw this movie twice. The movie deals with everyday marriage problems that all couples face after the honeymoon period is over. I love the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Instead of making a boring movie about how to work things out between married couples, this movie is an adventure.The movie's ending needs to be better. There are lots of loose ends. We never know who the bad guy is. We don't know if they continue to be assasins after the shootout scene."
2,WHA-,"ya see here dat this move...well just seems to weird.but who cares.i might as well watch my own mom and dad run in circles callin each other bad names and trying to whack each other with a vase.If ur an adult,plz go see batman begins.or just see madagascar or herbie fully loaded.trust me...ull be happy u followed my decision."
1,Watch With Ear Plugs,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith is lovely to watch. Beautiful leads, great houses, athletic bang-bang scenes, etc. etc. Watch the movie with earplugs. The earplugs allow you to admire the beauty yet protect you from potential brain damage inflicted by the ... ahem ... plot."
2,Dumb movie but ok entertainment,Ok to watch it while playing guitar or something else but to give 2 hours to this movie is not worthwhile. The plot is insultingly stupid but the action is fun.
2,"Done before, a lot better.","Take ""Prizzi's Honor"" (look it up if you've never seen it) and remove 80% of the intelligence of that movie. Mix in ""Die Hard"" but remove 50% of the ""realism"" (When Bruce Willis got shot at by a bunch of guys with automatic weapons, at least he was wounded). Take care not to allow the story to be be tainted with anything resembling plot, logic or believability. Mix well and you have ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"".But dang! Those two shore are purty!"
1,A terrible movie,"I happened to watch this movie on a transatlantic flight. If I had paid money to see it in a theater I would have asked for my money back.The premise is clever but all else is totally stupid: bullets flying everywhere, someone hit by a car, things blowing up. Nobody gets hurt.An unfortunate showcase for two ""beautiful people""."
3,ah ha ha ha ha!!!!,"I don't like Brad Pitt. I think Angelina Jolie is ok. But I _loved_ this movie. It was fast paced, funny, thoroughly entertaining, and just kept me engaged the whole time.This movie is by no means a classic/Oscar worthy. But it's good, clean fun with some great explosions/effects, and just a rockin' good time. It really helped that the chemistry was so good.I don't buy many movies, but I got this one. Worth the rental at the very least."
2,Hollywood action muck,"Mr & Mrs Smith is another Hollywood summer film, full of explosions and sexual tension you really dont care about. All thr hype around Pitt and Jolie doesnt help nor save this average and boring movie."
4,Bonnie & Clyde meets True Lies,"This movie was almost as entertaining as the off-screen love triangle that this movie sparked between Pitt, Jolie, and Aniston. You get a sense that Pitt and Jolie are falling in lust with each other during the making of this (who could blame them?) and that helps intensify every scene (as if it needed it). Wild and fun and stylish, the only thing that might have improved it would have been a cameo from Aniston herself. Come to think of it, she may have wanted to visit the set more often."
4,Brad and Angelina are great together in this film,"My husband and I thought it was smart and sexy! Personally, I don't care about all the relationships that came out of this movie (or relationships that were broken). It's none of our business as movie watchers. There is a good chemistry between the two of them and that's what made this a better than average film."
2,Overrated to the xxxtreme,"Everyone I talked to seemed to really like this film. I may be more likely to dislike it because I was so skeptical from the start that I would only watch it when it came on cable. Overall, the film was boring, not very funny, and even the acting fell flat.In the end, this represents what I think are actually the worst movies: the lower level of mediocrity. It wasn't bad enough to make it campy and funny, and it wasn't good enough to truly entertain me. However, I will give it credit for being better than Crank."
3,somewhat disappointed,"While not a huge fan of Rasputina, I like them enough that I was itching to purchase this as soon as I heard about it (in fact, I bought it that very night on iTunes). And there're a few good songs on it - Secret Message, If Your Kisses [...], The Mayor. But gone are the _really_ nice gems like Trust All-Stars and Trenchmouth.On Frustration Plantation there are odd songs, silly little songs, and some WTH songs that rather caught me off guard. It's just not cohesive enough, both the songs within themselves and in their relation to the whole. All in all I'm not going to rave about it, but it might grow on me. I'll just warn not-too-big fans to be careful with this album."
5,Another great from Rasputina,"When I first heard this album, I was amazed. Even better than their previous album, Cabin Fever!, this album provides everything that the 'Ether' fans loved and everything that the 'Forest' fans loved. Combined with a slight Southern feel, this album is both rocking and calming all at the same time. My favorites are 'Doomsday Averted', 'If Your Kisses Can't Hold the Man You Love' and 'My Captivity By Savages'. I always smile at the line in 'Kisses', ""Neglected girls shouldn't worry....that's what God made sailors for!"" All in all, its an excellent album that will be loved by all old fans and new as well."
4,Awww :(,I much prefer Robin Williams' version of the mirror song and would like to hear it as a proper track! :/ sad now... lol
2,"Good movie, one good song.","I bought this CD just for one song, Happy Worker. I would give more stars if I could have just downloaded it via Amazon MP3."
4,That's exciting item.,"I want to listen a tune that is ""Welcome to the plesuredome"". This tune is used for a pro-wrestler theme. A wrestler is called Shinya-Hashimoto, he is famous wrestler in Japan. After listening theme I'm plesured the tune, and I know that other tunes are very exciting too! If you read my impression, you should listen the CD. Bye."
5,Faithful soundtrack,"If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. It's as simple as that. I'm going to wear this CD out in no time."
3,"Good stories, bad editing","As a newly hired conductor with a western railroad, I purchased this book to get some more insight on my new job. The stories that Mr. Lothridge tells are entertaining and great examples of the good and bad of railroading - however, I unfortuntately have to say that the book is filled with grammatical, spelling, and other errors. I seemed to find some type of error on every page, and it does take something away from the book.Mr. Lothridge's writing, while mostly detailed and precise, sometimes jumps all over the place, and makes a general assumption that the reader has a fairly good knowledge of railroads before picking up the book.The first chapter of the book describes the history of railroading in the United States, but doesn't go into enough details about the railroads that Mr. Lothridge worked for.Even with all of the editing problems, this is a book that I would recommend for the content."
1,Proofreader needed,"I expected a lot from this book, based on earlier reviews. While the stories are moderately enjoyable, the book as a whole is spoiled by an average of one error of spelling, grammar, or usage per page."
1,Dangerous,"My Gold-capped conure was able to tear the clappers (hammers) from inside the two end bells, leaving the metal pieces that held the clappers into the bells twisted and sharp. Dangerous! I could find only one of the two clappers that the bird tore off the toy. I may pull the wicker balls off the arc, soak them to remove some dye, and re-use them in other toys. But I won't buy any toys from Super Bird Creations again."
4,great toy,"He loves the toy . He has it almost destoryed in a week but that what this type of toy is for. He plays/ chews on it everyday. It is smaller than I thought it would be but Buddy LOVES it. Arrived fast, decent price and my bird loves it : )"
2,Misleading pictures,"My bird, an african grey parrot, tore this toy up in less than a minute. The balls looked bigger in the pictures, so I thought he would at least get a week out of it. That was not the case."
2,Frustrated,"This book could be really good if you just need it to reference information that you may need for a research project. The quizzes are not as simple because you can't find the answer in the book. I believe the author should look at this material more closely because it's not helpful to students. If you are considering economics as your major, you may think again after using this book."
3,Macedon,"This book was in good condition and arrived in good time. I'm generally satisfied, apart from one thing. For some reason the textbook is missing the better part of Chapter 10. Likely a mistake that started w/ the printer and may have gone unnoticed."
4,Great,"This book shipped really quickly! However, it was not exactly the same book as pictured online (different cover) but was still the same edition.If your professor is very picky about which book to buy, check with the seller before purchasing ."
5,Excellent!,"No delivery problems. It arrived in very good condition, no defects. I am very satisfied with the product, as well as my daughter."
3,Interesting,This is an interesting way to spend some idle time. The reader learns some new things about this famous singer/actor's life. At times it is poignant.
1,A bloated mess,"This overlong, bloated mess reads like very bad Michener. It is populated with cardboard characters(including an impossible, improbable villain,) who struggle through an episodic, pointless plot. Even the editing is poor--typos abound; the point seemed to be get this on the stands ASAP (and the lurid cover seemed designed to capitalize on Benchley's <Jaws> fame, even though this book has virtually nothing in common with that well-done thriller). The anachronistic dialogue and corny pseudo-mysticism don't help. I finished it only because I was trapped on a plane with nothing else to read."
1,HMMM......... NO,"Horrible! ""Why must they put Peter Benchley's name on the front cover?"" I asked myself as I was reading this fodder. Its miss leading. This is not a novel by Peter Benchley, he wouldn't write such a lame tell. Mr. MacGregor makes the Amazon sounds as scary as my back yard. And as believable as Home Alone 3. Not to mention he never seemed to focus on any one subject. It kept skipping around, till there wasn't a story to follow. One thing that really got on my nerves about this novels, many children was robbed of there youth. 3 girls were rapped at different times, and 1 boy was almost force into sex by his uncle! (yuk)Wouldn't one prove his point. Stay Away from this garbage!"
2,A real waste of money,"'Revolvers ?' The year is 1627 and they have revolvers ? It was single shot flintlocks or matchlocks, but advanced weapons as portrayed were centuries in the future!This is what happens when someone 'novelizes' a screenplay."
4,Amazin' Amazon: The Ghost Tribe,"First of all, I recieved this book as a gift--I probably would not have picked this out on my own. I'm not one for period pieces, but I was soon hooked by this book and the notion it proposed: Pilgrims in South America (hey, Columbus made it to the Carribean.)I found the book to be engaging and well-paced. It certainly kept me coming back to it and I found it hard to put down. Very few books that weave that kind of spell on me. At close to 400-pages in length, I finished the book in a few weeks--fast for me.I recommend this book to anyone who includes a clean read: very little (if any) profanity, the violence is relatively non-gratuitous, and the sex mostly discreet (this is not a Romance novel.) I was misled that it was written by Peter Benchley, but later realized Rob MacGregor wrote this."
1,YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER,"GREAT COVER GRAPHICS,LOUSY BOOK.SOMEBODY DIDN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK ON THIS ONE.THE AUTHOR AND EDITOR SHOULD BE SHOT.GIVE THE GRAPHIC DESIGNER A RAISE ! THIS BOOK IS SO BAD,THAT IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT I WROTE IT!"
3,Not up to par....,"Not what I had hoped for. The story lacked development, not to mention an ending. The book ends like MacGregor just got tired of writing, ran out of paper, said ""oh well, I guess I'll end it here"". I think that the story had potential it just never lived up to it's billing. It's not one that I would read again, nor recommend to anyone. I never saw Peter Benchley's interpretation of the book, now I have no desire to.It's not a horrible book, it's just missed the mark. It lacked development and a conclusion."
2,Depressing Film Despite Good Cast,"If you're looking for an upbeat, morale boosting film, this isn't the one! The plot is interesting, the cast is good, but the story is so sad that in the end I came away wishing I hadn't watched it--and sent the movie back for a refund. It's one of those films that makes you care about the fate of individuals, then starts killing them off, one by one. Yes, that may be historically accurate, but that's not why I watch movies. I want some satisfying escapism, not a reminder that war is hell and anyone could die at any moment. If you want some very fine British WWII films, I recommend ""British War Cinema"" or any of the other fine films made during that era for the purpose of showing the war and raising morale. Skip this one--it's depressing."
5,great movie,"I thought this movie was terrific, Clive Owen is great. All the acting was super, and I enjoyed every minute of it.This is one i will definitely watch again. I also will recommend it to anyone, it is 100% worth watching."
5,Scary but important to watch,"Not an entertaining ""movie"" but an important Film.....all the prior reviewers have said the important stuff..but watch it, the nuances and subtle messages to parents are just as important as the bigger picture. What are we allowing to have happen to our kids?!?"
5,Trust,"Trust is a great movie. Every parent with a tween or teen daughter or son should watch this. This movie really shows just what is out there on the Internet. You just don't know who exactly you're indeed talking to on a screen.I won't give out any spoilers but you won't be disappointed. This movie is way better than other movies like it, such as, the movie Hard Candy."
2,Documentary for Class?,"The reviews explain what the movie is about etc.. However, I wish I knew that this was not a big picture 'movie' in the full sense of the term .. I would place this piece under parental guidance or High school training.. Although I like the actors and the predators are a serious problem in society, I would still cautious the viewers. The only reason I gave it a 2 stars rating is for the actors, not the story.There is no story...."
2,So so predictable. Girl meets boy...,"on internet, girl falls head over hills in love with boy, they talk, boy wants to meet girl, dumb girl says yes, girl meets up with guy, girl finds out guy is older, guy rapes her blah blah blah. This happens in real life and in the movies, same story different people."
1,Not what I expected,"I had previously watched the movie ""Taken"" with Liam Neeson and thought this would be along the same lines. I found Taken to be the much better movie. In Trust you don't feel much sympathy for the girl because of her horrible attitude. I was actually mad at her! I wouldn't recommend this movie although I do like the actors."
3,*** A good movie to watch with your teens ***,"I have read some of the other reviews and agree with some. Yes, the movie does drag on at parts, but the acting is good and the story is believable. If this were to happen in real life, it would likely 'drag on' like that too. I didn't find the movie pace slow though; I really have no patience for slow movies, and I was not bored at all during any of this.I think it's a worthwhile rental. I like Clive Owen and Catherine Keener, and the actress who played the daughter was pretty good."
2,Guess I was expecting a revenge film,"I've read and seen stories like this before: Something tragic happens. Victims and victims' friends and family try to cope. Movie ends. Nothing's really resolved. No one gets caught. Zzzzzz.Yes, they most likely wanted to portray something more ""realistic"" and focus on how a family can fall apart. Yeah, I get that. But that's something you can watch on a regular talk show or Dateline special.But I like to watch movies for escapism or to see things that go beyond the ordinary life. I wanted to see the father find the a-hole and kick the crap out of him. If I wanted to see a movie which was only about family members crying and arguing, I could've turned on Dr. Phil.Don't get me wrong. It's still a well made movie. The acting's good. It just feels like going to a 5 star restaurant with the hopes of dining on a steak dinner only to hear the chefs chit chat in the background and then be told that the kitchen's closed but they hope we enjoyed our visit."
3,Where the eff is the ending?,"I seriously believe that all the 4 and 5 star reviews are fake. After the 14 year old girl gets raped,the family starts looking for the preditor,and they keep looking and looking till the movie ends. When I rented this film I thought it was ganna be a movie about revenge,but I was wrong. The only thing thats good about this movie is that it proves a point.it shows teens that they shouldnt trust people that they meet online,plus it shows how some older men try to take advantage of young girls.this is the type of film that teachers should show in class,or that therapist should watch with theire young patients. If ur looking for a movie to enjoy with a good ending then do not even bother to watch this"
3,"""Overwrought Acting at Times""","A formulaic film in many respects, it attempts to balance a very prurient subject matter with an equally strong morality message, I had the feeling that it could have just as well been produced as a ""Made for TV"" special-- as opposed to a full length film. Nonetheless, there are some moments of insight into the pre-adolescent mind as well as the advertising world's preoccupation with teenaged sexuality. Some of the acting is seriously overwrought, but nonetheless manages to provide some passable entertainment--keeping in mind that the whole thing is based on a story of criminal perversion and destructiveness."
2,Depressing,The movie was depressing with no redeeming quality. Could have gone all my life without seeing this. Don't waste your time.
2,Made for tv movie,"This is a good movie for parents to show there teens. But for the general public it is lacking. It reminded me of those old made for tv movie that teach kids a lesson. Lesson on drug use, or peer pressure, ect. Now with the internet an preditors this movie arrives. Sorry did not like it."
3,Not worth Watching,"movie is okay only in the beginning then it gets boring and nothing really happens in the end, this movie is incomplete"
3,Potential but falls flat,"This movie starts with a lot of potential but turns a little silly halfway. In an age when so much is talked about online predators, it is hard to believe that a teenager would still fall so easily and willingly in the trap on one. The script is just not strong enough and the direction is clumsy (sorry David Schwimmer, I am a big fan). The acting is solid all around, especially from the always reliable Clive Owen. A mildly interesting movie that could have had more impact if the subject would have been treated in a more realistic manner."
3,not lolita II,"SSPOILERS...SPOILERS...nabokov's scandalous lolita was essentially not about pedophilia, but a comitragedy as dark as they can be drawn that counters human beauty versus human hopelessness. lolita is deeply wounded, but she survives and thrives, whereas her seducer does not. this trust is about trust versus the same thing. a sexually molested 14 year old attempts to accomodate the false romance of a 35 years pedophile, who is not in the least sympathetic, unlike the clumsy but deadly humbert humbert who actually attempts it. a rather painful study in broken trust versus the attempts of kind and loving individuals to mend it."
2,Absurd,"** SPOILERS INCLUDED **Children, especially teenagers, are smarter than what parents think.Hence, the foundation of the plot is absurd for these reasons: 1) a 14 year old high school freshman girl meets a guy online who she thinks is a sophomore.... 2)...then the guy admits the he is really in college (she keeps talking to him)... 3)... then the guys admits that he is a graduate student (she is still talking to him)... 4)...then they meet in person and they looks like he's 40! (she still talks to him).Really? No, really?This was a .99 rental on Amazon Instant Video and I stopped the movie right there.It was just impossible for me to believe that in the age of 'To Catch a Predator' and extensive media coverage of situations like this that a modern teenage girl wouldn't have run for dear life, or at the very least realized that the guy was a creep and ditched him.Giving it 2 stars because of the great acting in the 30 minutes that I watched."
4,Movie Review,"Excellant acting, plot, full of suspense and realistic frustration. Downside is that it is more on the realistic side than entertaining. If that's what you are looking for, this show's for you."
3,"it is, what it is...","It is exactly what it looks like, a simple cheap 4 switch wall plate. The first one came cracked, which was very discouraging, but a new one was sent out quickly."
4,Kermit Rides Again,"Back in my day, we had what was called ""Nursery School."" Unfortunately, I was a drop-out. All I can remember is that we played Cowboys and Indians with the Kindergarten class, and they always got to be the cowboys. Naturally, at the end of the game the Indians all got shot. I also remember falling off the monkey bars and getting my mouth rinsed out with soap. Sheesh!So what does this have to do with the delightful little book, ""I Can Go to Preschool?"" Just this: Had I been able to obtain a copy of this book, which does such a great job of dispelling fears about preschool, I might have been able to tough it out and stay in school. Kermit sure seems to like it. Any kid facing preschool would do well to prep with the frog before that first big day.If nothing else, the happy times that Kermit has can help you to forget about your own, somewhat less happy, experiences."
5,Excellent sign language DVD for your child!,"Our kids started watching this DVD around 1 1/2 years old, and they quickly picked up on most of the signs after seeing it only a few times. Once they learned the sign for ""more"", they would ask to watch it ""more"" over and over again. :-)Up until that point, they were a little behind in their verbal development, but after seeing this video it vastly improved their vocabulary, both signing and verbal.I've seen clips of a few other sign language videos for kids (some on the web, some from Comcast On-Demand), and in my un-scientific opinion I think Talking Hands is the least likely to induce ADHD. Other videos (like Baby Signing Time and Baby Einstein) have a lot of distracting animations and/or rapid transitions from scene to scene, whereas Talking Hands has an adult or child repeating each sign slowly and deliberately multiple times, then showing actual real-world examples of each sign.I highly recommend Talking Hands!"
2,Didn't keep my child's attention,Compared to another Signing dvd this one did not keep my child's attention. I kinda made me feel weird when the signer adults never even looked forward into the camera. I would not suggest getting this dvd at all....I would suggest another company...Signing Time.
1,Stinky Robot Signs!,"This video is definitely NOT my favorite. As the mother of a hearing, nonverbal child for whom Signing has been alife saver, let me tell you that this video is dry, robotic and not terrifically helpful. My child wasn't interested at all. We have other videos like Signing Time that are much better."
3,"Did the job, but kinda boring to watch more than once","My son has a birth defect that causes speech delay. He had been going to speech therapy for months in which they were trying to teach him sign so he could communicate in some way until he could speak. Months and month he didnt sign one word. We bought this video and after watching it once he never had an interested in it anymore. Then we bought the signing time video series,and the next day he was signing and is now up to 40 signs in 2 months and still going strong! He is so happy to be communicating and he thinks it is fun! I highly recommend the signing time videos they are much much better then talking hands and fun to watch over and over again , my husband and I love to watch them too and the music is awesome!!!!"
4,Surprising,"At first listen, New London Fire sound, perhaps, like a combination of The Killers and The Strokes, with the latter being the stronger influence. But more listens show a deeper understanding of music that I don't believe either of the previously mentioned bands currently have. On the opening track, ""Different"" (and in a few others) you can hear the driving rhythm of...a banjo? That's certainly a departure from your typical rock/new wave album. The vocalist has a strong control of his instrument as well, and that makes these tunes even more encompassing to listen to.I'm not going to go on and on about each song and what makes this album worth your time and money. Honestly, if you weren't at least partially interested, you wouldn't be reading this right now. But you'll love it."
1,IT's to bad for words....,"I recently received 14 workout videos and this one is the worst out of them all. first off there is a guy that doesn't speak English that well. He is guiding you through your workout.. He doesn't count off the exercise he is on, the warm up is not long enough and he switches to the next exercise with no warning. ON top of him talking there is a women talking over him telling you what to do after he has switched to the next exercise. If you look at the soap opera actor in the back he is not doing the exercises correctly. I ended up stopping the video and putting in one that proves to be more professional and user friendly.. IF you want a good kickboxing workout try Kathy Smith kickboxing workout or any of The Firm Videos... They have many different workouts on one DVD..Making it more bang for your buck.."
5,Great Title for Long-time Lover/New Listener,"This CD has some excellent marches on it, not only many of my favorites, but the best performances of those favorites. You really can't get a much better sampler of one of the most charged genres in classical music."
4,Cowboy boots DR,"According to measurements, I'm an 8 1/2 3E but I've never tried on a shoe that size my whole life. I've always worn a 9 or 10 D. Actually, the perfect size always seems to be right between. Only once in my life have I put on new shoes and felt they fit me perfectly. Based on other comments these boots are on the wide side so I bought a 9 . Well, they slipped on well! They are not supper comfortable and lack a bit of arch support but I'm hard to fit. The only down side is the upper part doesn't seem to be real leather. Its very soft and thin like synthetic material. I bought them to give me ankle support after a sprain. They won't give me the support I really want but at least they fit.Aug.24/2012 Note: I'm raising these to four stars. I am very happy with the fit of these boots after breaking them in. I would give them five if the uppers were real leather."
3,What You See Ain't What You Get!,"Nice Sergio Mendes stuff even though the (unlisted) presence of Stan Getz as usual overpowers everything and everyone. I wonder if they make mutes for tenor saxes? BUT never mind what the jacket says and what the imprinted menu on the CD itself says, songs that are listed are just not there - specifically Aquarius and She's A Carioca. (There may be others but my Portuguese is a little lacking.) PeterD"
2,Brazil'65 DIDN'T HAVE ANY HITS...,"It is fair to say that the material contained on this album is pleasing enough to listen to,and maybe,in Brazil,these sides were local hits(although this is doubtful),but the fact of the matter remains that it was not until Mendes put together Brazil'66 and put out albums on the A & M label that he actually had hit records...To say the these are""greatest hits"" is to be deliberately deceptive...These are early sides,recorded when Mendes and his band were local artists..Sure,they sound similiar to his later,hit sides,but,afterall,it was essentially the same band with the same personel...So if you actually remember any of these obscure sides,or if you are a Mendes completist,this is something that you will want to own,HOWEVER,if you are looking for the artist at his peak then fast-forward to BRAZIL'66,and there you will find the real""greatest hits""..."
2,See the movie instead,"""A Letter to Three Wives"" is one of my favorite films. The film is set several years later and the whole country and its residents were quite changed. In the book, Brad Bishop is still in the Navy, Rita doesn't write for the radio, and of course, Addie is very ""present"" in the story while she isn't visible in the film. The concise character arcs, witty dialogue and rich, layered characters are all from director Joe Mankiewicz. The two wives cut from the film are the least interesting in the book."
5,it rocks!!!!!,"a great show from start to finish,well recorded and edited.sound quality is great and video is outstanding.a must for any cooper fan!"
5,Alice Cooper Brutally Live,Once again Alice Cooper has rocked music lovers and concertgoers in another world tour. Brutally Live is a mix of new Alice material blended perfectly with the classic Alice that shock rocked the world in the early 70's. Brutally Live is a eye widening theatrical show from start to finish that will never let you forget Alice is the KING OF SHOCK ROCK that nobody can duplicate.
4,Brutally Live,Brutally Live was the best of all three Alice Cooper DVD's that I purchased. Rock on!!Alice Cooper - Brutally Live (DVD & CD)
4,Alice Rules!,"Brutally Live is a recording of a concert form LaBatt's Apollo in Hammersmith, England on July 19th of 2000. Alot of the songs on here are from the album he is supporting, Brutal Planet. The songs are good but it is not the Alice I know and love. They are more nu-metal than anything. But this DVD has a bunch of hits too.HIGHLIGHTSFeed My FrankensteinBallad of Dwight FryNo More Mr. Nice GuyIt's Hot TonightCaught In A DreamLOW POINTSPoisonTake It Like A WomanBlow Me A KissOverall, it's not a bad DVD. Fans of Alice will enjoy it. It also comes with a bonus cd which is just the concert minus some tracks."
2,defective disc.,"after buying alice cooper- brutally live, i played it but the seconed half of the disc is scambled, so i returned it , i recieved a new one, put it into my player hoping it would'nt happen again, but it did,do other buyers experience this same problem?i am not going to return this dvd a third time."
3,I feel ripped off!,"Shortly after I purchased this, they reissue this with a free audio CD?! Is there some way I can receive this without selling my old DVD and repurchasing this product??"
2,Most disappointed,OF all the DTS cds that I own this one proved to be the most disappointing. I was expecting more -- better showmanship and video and better sound mixing. Compared to the Eagles or BeeGees DTS -- this is a poor runner up. Unless you are a died-hard Alice fan -- spend your money elsewehere. This CD doesn't compete with others.
2,didnt mention anything about commentary thru the whole movie,If your going to make a movie at least let the viewers know there is commentary through the whole movie.
3,Hot bass,"I origally got this cd for the song woof woof and I saw them in concert and they tore it up. They took their music to a different level on this one and have many different styles on this cd.some some dont song like bass music at all. Im not a big bass fan music but they still have some good song on here. I like #5,10,23(ft. jt money), 26 is one that I love. Too bad bass music went out and they faded away. Check this cd out."
3,Very Average,"The first 3 songs on 16 Volt's debut album are quite good: 'Motorskill', 'Wisdom', and 'Head of Stone'. After that the drop-off in quality is pretty steep.I've had this album ever since it was released and I have never been able to get past the first 3 tracks.16 Volt is not quite as good as their contemporaries of this time period: FLA, Skinny Puppy, Numb, Mentallo, NIN, Front 242, et al."
1,Cheri Kempf or Amanda Freed?,Why do you feature Amanda Freed on your cover? Did she contribute to this book? Are you her coach?
5,"My Mother ""The Actress""","Marjorie Cooley is my mother. She is now eighty five years old and was thrilled when I gave her the DVD. I also bought several other films she was in from other sources. She was seventeen and under contract with Twentieth Century Fox when this was filmed. So of course, I think it is a marvelous film. I would be very pleased to purchase any others, if you can locate more."
1,utterly hopeless,"I have seen some junk over the years, but this takes the prize...the most useful part was the 3.5mm cord and batteries. I doubt that this product cost more than $5 to make and I think its an embarrassment to Monster Cable, who I thought associated themselves with 'quality'...avoid this like the plague and go and buy the Tivoli-PAL...sure its more expensive, but you'll regret buying this Monster product, unless of course you make telephone calls with two bean tins and a piece of string, in which case you'll be pleasantly suprised!"
1,Absolute Garbage,Seldom do I find a product that is so bad that I only use it once. Unfortunately I bought it for an international trip and the return period was over when I got back. I offered to give it to the store to demo so that no one else would buy them. Don't waste your money.
1,Trashy in Every Way!,"Wow! Incredible that such a cheap and useless product could every make it to market. The sound is horrible and the case construction is flimsy. When you open the case, the wires are exposed. I nearly broke the case just getting the batteries in. Luckily, for me, I purchased mine at Meijer for just $7.00 on clearance...but in my opinion, I feel I was ripped off even at this price."
1,avoid unless free gift (with free shipping),The sound is as bad as bad can get. ANY laptop speakers (built in) will sound better. There is absolutely no use for this item. Not even for those who can tolerate mp3 sound.
3,speakers,I was disappointed with the quality of the product. I expected something made by Moster to be high quality
3,The smell is pretty...but it doesn't help long term.,"I had higher hopes for this. Maybe I'm just too heavy of a sweater, but I couldn't use this on a daily basis. I found that I started to stink 1/2 way through the day. I think it just doesn't work with my body chemistry. Not that it doesn't. It did help, just not long term. I'd have to carry it with me to make sure I was OK by the end of the day. It does smell pretty though and will probably use it as a body spray in the summer."
5,It worked!,I love the scent (and i'm not a fan of roses aroma) and it really works! I would buy it again.
2,Not an all day deodorant,"I typically use the chemical deodorant and have been looking to make the switch to natural. Regular deodorant (not clinical strength) works just great for me, and I don't actually sweat much so I don't think I'm a ""hard case"" in the deodorant department. Anyway, I've tried this deodorant for a few days and it lasts about 4 hours before the underarm smell begins to break through. Once that happens, reapplication doesn't really help. Since I am looking for an all-day natural deodorant, I am forced to say that this deodorant is a failure."
4,It works,"So when I put this product on it did smell like an old lady's perfume, but I found that if you put coconut oil over the top it does reduce the smell enough that it isn't over powering. It worked throughout the whole day of stress chasing around a 2 year old in a busy farmers market and festival. After putting it on at 10:00am (2 sprays) with a layer of coconut oil over the top to easy the smell at first. By about 12:00 the old lady smell went away and emerge a lovely rose smell which is still there at 6:00pm. I do recommend it is healthy and works, a great combo."
1,This product cannot be returned!,"I bought this product thinking that I could return it if I didn't like it. (Usually Amazon is great about this.)Wrong.Apparently, this is due to it being a liquid and so it's considered hazardous and not returnable. So, either buy this from a local store or be super sure you want it before you purchase."
2,Not what it could have been,"I purchased this because I've had good results from Weleda's products and decided to try this deodorant.Well, it keeps you from smelling bad for a day. That's about it.If you like the fragrance of roses, however, and are looking for a natural deodorant with this essence, you will be disappointed. The rose smell is mixed with lemon and the result is comparable to a supermarket furniture polish.If you are looking for a gentle floral, I suggest Aubrey Organics Calendula. If you like citrus, Weleda makes a nice citrus deodorant. This product just seems to miss the mark."
5,Best natural deodorant I've found!,"Finally something that works and smells good! I've been having trouble with natural deodorants, some just plain don't work, and some make me smell weird... like fruit loops (which after a while gets old). My friend recommended this product to me, and I couldn't be happier!"
2,Didnt work for me,I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant. This product didn't work for me. It might be okay as a body spray..but not as a deodorant. I had my hubby asking me why I smell like rubbing alcohol (not good). It also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving.
5,Great Deodorant,"There can be a slight burn or warming sensation putting this on, mostly after shaving. But 3 sprays under each arm will last me all day - mowing the lawn, running errands, playing with the kids or sitting on the couch. I'm as fresh at night as I am when I first put it on, without a heavy perfume smell."
2,Contains toxins I didn't expect,"Lately I've learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it's sold in a health food store. I recently discovered the Skin Deep Database, where you can look up products and ingredients to find out if they contain toxins. I'd used this deodorant for two years. Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours, I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using. Wrong! When I looked it up on the Skin Deep Database, I found out that this deodorant rates a 4 on the toxin scale, which is the ""caution"" range. I switched to Lafe's spray deodorant, which is a 0 on the toxin scale, and it works MUCH better without any toxins. Lafe's keeps me and my husband smelling good from morning to bed time."
1,Ineffective and Smells like old lady perfume,I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here. The other reviewers must have low expectations. Seriously. This does not stop odor. It is just a really strong smelling body spray. Even after discovering that it didn't work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady's perfume. Very strong floral/baby powderish smell. It gave me a headache. I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective (you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather or if you are a heavy sweater but at least it does work). That is what I will be going back to. I tried this because I just wanted to try something different and there were glowing reviews. Big old waste of money :(
4,"Great scent, pretty good protection","I've been going out of my mind trying different deodorants as I'm trying to give up antiperspirants. This is the best I've found so far and I keep coming back to it. I really like the scent, it's a nice rose, not too old lady. However, this does not keep you from sweating, none of them do, so you need to reapply throughout the day. I probably reapply 2-3 times in winter and twice that much in summer. I'm a sweater though, keep that in mind. It's not sticky or tacky nor does it smell like hippy. Oh, also, this will not work with bare underarms, ie with dropped long sleeves/dolman cut or tank tops that are low. If your underarms are just bare with no other material, you'll be sweating & stinking pretty quick & this will not help that much. I've resigned to just use regular deodorant/antiperspirants on those days. You can't win them all."
2,"Sorry, I do not like the smell","I am not sure about the other varieties, but I do not like how Wild Rose smells, it does have a sort of baby powder/alchohol smell to it However, it does seem to work. I think I will try another scent."
2,The setup for a great triology,This is a good suspence story that sets the base for the The OffWorlder triology that's set (story timeline)2 years later.If you enjoyed the Off worlder/ Shadow Chasers/ Escape form Planet Earth books then this is a nessary book to that collection along with Second Sighting.
3,Not as good,"Of the Strange Matter books I have read, I have loved each and every one of them EXCEPT this one. It was not good. It did not live up the the series. My favorite is either A Place to Hide or Knightmare. Anyone know of any way to bring Strange Matter back? It was excellent? anyone know how to contact the authors?"
3,Doesn't live up to the series,"Strange Matter was an awesome series (I can't believe they canceled it!), but this just is not a typical book of it. Of all the Strange Matter books I've read, I'd say this is the worst. Strange Matter is good, but this book isn't. (anyone know of a petition to bring it back? E-mail me at mstone32@yahoo.com)."
4,Great pictorial history of fashion of the 30's,"This book gives a good look at what the Sears catalog offered in the way of women's fashions in the thirties. Merchandise is grouped by year and then by women's, men's etc. Descriptions are text from the catalog and in some cases give what fabric was used, orignal catalog prices are also included. Accessories such as shoes, hats and jewelery are also pictured.A great resource for stage cotumes. If you are a good seamstress, today's patterns can be modified to create styles similar to those of the thirties."
4,Useful and enjoyable reference,"This is the first book from this series I obtained. It is a useful reference tool not only for the major pieces of clothing but also how accessories were used and placed. (It's not always easy to figure out those crazy 30s hats!). The descriptions, being authentic to the time, are delightful as well. My only complaint, which is really more wishful thinking, is that the book could be a bit longer. However, no major clothing/accessory category was left out."
5,The best in my book!,This is actually my second one. My first one recently quit heating and I was so lost without it. Couldn't be found in any stores so had to order it online. Thank you Amazon for quick shipping!!! I highly recommend this coffee pot.
3,Purchase review.,"it requires more coffee to make a robust flavor than my old machine. I would order a restrict or, but don,t want to empty it to get the numbers off the bottom!!"
3,Must be made in Holland...,"...because of the way it leaks, get it?. Over the last eighteen months, I was finding standing water on the kitchen counter that I blamed on the faucet's spray attachment because it couldn't be the Bunn, right?. Wrong. Made coffee yesterday morning, turned my back to answer the phone and next thing I know there's a flood on the countertop that Noah would be concerned about. Discoveried that Bunn has a 3 year warranty, so I am currently waiting to hear back on the email I sent customer service. Yes, it's fast, makes good, hot joe but could never find filters with high enough sides to contain grounds.Was bought on sale at Kohl's for $99, would not pay more."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I just packed this machine back it's box to be returned.Save the extra money and buy the regular Bunn.It brews nice,fast,hot coffee but within 15-20 minutes thecoffee is starting to get pretty cold!!!Forget about drinking itafter an hour unless you microwave it to reheat it.I even tried to preheat the carafe as suggested and that still didn't help.I thought this would be a great machine to have since I have small children(nothing they could get burnt on) but with having said that,I really need a nice hot cup of coffee!!!"
1,thermofresh?,"machine is supposed to keep the water in the well at 200 degrees so that you will always have hot coffee and the thermal carafe is supposed to keep it hot. you have to run hot water into the carafe to heat it up, then you have to put cold water in the well. well the coffee wasn't hot and the carafe didn't keep the heat very well. the result was warm coffee."
3,How to make the carafe stop leaking,"I bought this brewer in October. At first I was very happy with it. Then the carafe started leaking so bad it was ridiculous. I called Bunn a couple of days ago and the lady told me to wash the spout and the seal around the rim with Dawn dishwashing soap (she specifically said Dawn which I happened to have on hand) and the carafe would perform much better. She said that after a number of uses the oil from the coffee keeps the seal from sealing well. I hung up fully expecting to call her back in a few minutes. I washed the carafe as she suggested and it works like new again... no leaks!! If you have this pot, try it, you'll be amazed at the difference. Now I love this brewer again!"
1,carafe on Bunn leaks,Carafe leaks cant make a full pot and it leaks all the way around top when you poor a cup. This sucks Cant find a carafe to fit it and its a huge hassel sending it back so Im just screwed.
3,Old one is better,"The coffee is not that hot, doesn't stay hot enough in the Carafe. No indicatorson the Carafe as to how much water to put in for only a few cups. I like my old Coffemaker much better. Coffee does taste good from the new one."
4,OK for Tea,"We bought this to brew tea to make iced tea. We know it's not intended for that purpose, but previous experience with making tea using a coffee maker with good results led us to repeat the process. The Bunn requires running the water through the brewing process twice or else the tea is too weak."
5,Best Coffee Maker I ever purchased,This is the best coffee maker I ever purchased. Coffee is made fast and tastes great! Coffee maker doesn't leak water and the coffee stays hot in the carafe for a very long time.
4,Very good... but had a small problem,"When we first used this coffee pot, the water just raced through it and made very weak coffee. Turns out it was missing some parts.We contacted the Bunn company and they sent us replacements for free... and now it works great. Disappointed with receiving product with missing parts, though possibly not the sellers fault (unless it was a return that was resold)... but happy with the product overall."
4,bunn coffee maker,"BUNN BTX-B ThermoFresh 10-Cup Thermal-Carafe Home Coffee Brewer, BlackThis product works exactly as described - it's fast, efficient and looks great. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have liked for it to have some indication when the coffee is done (i.e., a light). Other than that, I would highly recommend this item."
5,Bunn Thermal,"This must have been our 12th of various coffee makers over the years. We are coffee phreaks and use expensive beans. The beauty that sets this unit apart is the complete LACK of a heating element under the carafe. The coffee comes out of the unit and into the carafe at a perfect temperature. AND it stays that way for several hours due to the great insulating properties of the carafe. Since the coffee isn't sitting on a heating element, it does not ""burn"", (which is the danger in all other coffee makers). You can re-heat the coffee in a microwave the next day and it'll still taste pretty good. We no longer throw out brewed coffee...we just reheat that last cup.BTW.....you coffee will be ready in about 3 minutes!!...this thing is fast because the water is kept at brewing temp 24/7, always ready for you."
5,Best experience... TWICE!,"Had the first BTX-B for over 2 years that makes and more importantly, keeps the coffee hot and fresh all day long! Purchased a second BTX-B to take to the office for my co-workers to experience and enjoy a great cup of coffee anytime... As long as there is coffee made!The 200 degree flooding of the grinds and the thermos syle pot keep the coffee hot and fresh without the worry and breakdown of the coffee from a hot plate.Simply brillinat!"
2,Disappointed!,"The good part is the coffee maker produces 10 tasty cups in 3 minutes as advertised and the thermal pot is nice. However, there are two very poorly engineered ""features"" of this machine. First, there are no markings on the machine or pot to tell the user how many cups (5 oz each) of water the user is adding. I took an old plastic container and marked it off with a sharpie for 4, 6, 8 and 10 cups. (Of course, 10 cups is a full pot so that one's easy.) Second, if you don't position the filter holder just right - and it seems like it's been pushed in tight - you get hot water and grounds all over the machine and your counter. Being an engineer, sloppy engineering really irritates me, but I think these ""features"" will annoy and disappoint most users. It's not worth $100+ that's for sure"
5,The BEST cup of coffee,"I have owned a regular Bunn with the glass decanter and a Thermal Carafe Coffee brewer. Yes, the machine is expensive and after 5 years of perfect coffee, I sadly went out and bought a cheaper brand just because I couldn't afford to run out and buy a BUNN. Well, I have not had a good cup of coffee since!!! So, tonight I broke down and bought another BUNN. You can spend $100 on a pricier brand, but they do not compare to the taste of a good BUNN machine! You might have to experiment with the coffee....and don't scrimp on cheap coffee....at least stick to the better name brands.....but believe me....it won't be the machine's fault. If you are a serious coffee drinker like my family and me, treat yourself to the best coffee brewer around!!!! You'll be glad you did!!!"
5,FIVE Years Later = Awesome,"I'm not even subtracting a star because the lid leaks after a week. The fix is so simple (using Dawn on rim of the carafe itself and the rim of the lid).It brews the perfect pot of coffee no matter the size. Temperature is always right on the money.The really great thing is the lack of the heating element. Nothing to continue to cook the coffee and ruin it.Perfect for making tea as well.We use it to make a couple of 3/4 full pots in the morning then about 4 single serving sizes for tea in the afternoon. This has gone on for 5 years. not a problem yet. Just check the temp of the water the other day, 180 degrees."
5,Works Very Well,Don't listen to the people that say that the carafe doesn't pour well. It pours better than any that I have every used! Makes coffee lightning quick and everyone at work thinks that the coffee tastes amazing.
4,Bunn BTX-B Coffee Maker Review,"It is an extremely fast coffee maker - about 3 minutes. Great! According to the fact sheet, the coffee meets the requirement temperature most people like; I personally like it hotter but my husband loves the current temperature. I put my coffee in the microwave to get it hotter."
5,Makes the best coffee i have ever had,I researched thorougly before buying this coffee maker and am totally satisfyed both with its quality of construction and most of all the taste of the coffee it brews. You will not be dissatisfyed if u buy this model and make of coffee maker. Of course Amazon was great to order from as usual. If Amazon has the product i want there is no compitition as far as i am concerned.
2,Coffee is not hot enough,We had the other Bunn with the glass carafe. We loved it. We decided to get this one with the thermal carafe.We are not happy with it. It does not get the coffee hot enough or keep it hot. I would not get it again.
4,very good,very easy to use brews coffee in 3 minutes the thermal coffeepot keeps the coffee hot without a burnt tase
5,Love this brewer,"We love this brewer after drinking coffee from a Mr. Coffee type of brewer for years! Finally, a great rich taste like you get at Starbucks...and it keeps the coffee hot until the last cup. I can't say how long it is hot, but we finish the last cup after about 1 hour and it is still great. But, when you select this brewer, do not get the Perma-Brew 3 Year basket which is suggested to purchase with the Bunn BT Velocity Brewer. We brew 6 cups in the morning. Because this brews so fast (which is great) the coffee is not able to filter through the basket fast enough. The water overflows the basket and the grounds empty into the carafe. Not a good thing. The paper filters have worked just fine for us."
1,Disappointing purchase,We have had Bunn coffee makers for the last 20 years. We bought this because of the stainless steel carafe rather than glass thinking it would be more durable. The carafe has no markings for the amount of cups you are making. That is workable but it also has no warming plate to keep the coffee warm after brewing and the thermos does not keep the coffee hot. If we had been aware of this we would have chosen a different model. Not happy with our purchase.
5,coffee maker,i got my coffee maker the day they said it would arrive followed the directions on how to get it started and it has been working just like it was described. the only thing diff is that it keeps the coffee hot longer in the thermal pot then what they said it would.
4,Great coffee!,"This coffee pot is awesome if you are an impatient coffee lover. It brews a full pot in about 4 minutes. It is easy to clean, and the thermal pot keeps the coffee warm for a long time. Since the pot doesn't sit on a burner, you can even reheat a cup the next day and it tastes much more like fresh coffee than it does from a pot where it sat on a warmer for hours."
5,Bunn Thermofresh Coffee Brewer,This Bunn thermofresh coffee brewer is the greatest. It operates as advertised and makes the best tasting coffee. The stainless steel container keeps the coffee fresh and hot for many hours. Highly recommend this coffee maker.
2,These machines are prone to developing leaks,"My wife and I purchased this item about 6 years ago. About six months ago it started leaking severely every time we made coffee with it. Finally I took the thing apart. There is a plastic tray that connects to the top of the water tank. The heat from the tank over a period of years has caused part of the plastic tray to break down and disintegrate. Checking the internet I discovered that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Bunn customers with the same problem. See [...] or Google on ""Bunn coffee maker leak"". After 3 to 6 years you can expect this machine to leak. At that point it will be basically unusable and Bunn apparently doesn't sell replacement parts. When you pay this much for a coffee maker you expect it incorporate a better design and last much longer. It appears that Bunn has known about this problem for a long time and has chosen to do nothing about it. My advice is to spend your money on something else."
2,Bad Coffee,"This coffee maker while fast, brews terrible coffee. I've tried every combination: more coffee, finer grind, distilled water and I finally am giving up and getting a different coffee maker. This was a replacement for a Braun coffee maker that made excellent coffee and so the bar was probably set rather high but for the price of this unit it should be able to make a decent cup of coffee and it does not. They seem to have put the emphasis on a fast cup of coffee rather than a good cup of coffee. I would prefer waiting a little longer and enjoying the flavor of my coffee."
2,Over priced & over glorified.,"Step out of Bunn for great coffee. There are many out there. We were shopping for a Bunn & the employee told us, ""yes they are good but there's better out there for the price."" She gave us a few names & we found our favorite. My husband & i LOVE our Capresso coffee maker which we purchased online. We have had it 4yrs without 1 problem & you get rid of paper filters which we always seemed to run out of or they always let grinds into the pot . Unless you are in a office or need 4 pots a day it's very over priced. Look at the problems people have had. Leaks, grinds in your pot, ect. My father asked for a new Bunn for xmas then asked me about my Capresso. He assumed it cost alot more than it did. Not only great coffee but attractive as well. It's fast, dishwasher safe & the carafe is great. For guest it's great to have a second carafe on hand. Bunn is a good maker but not great. With the cons i've read & seen i wouldn't spend $150 on it."
2,BUNN 10 CUP COFFEEMAKER,"AFTER ONLY HAVING THIS COFFEEMAKER FOR LESS THAN A MONTH, THE COFFEE WAS COMING OUT COLD AND SOMETIMES WOULD TURN ON EVEN THOUGH THE LID WAS OPEN. WE BOUGHT A BUNN COFFEEMAKER AS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH 3 COFFEEMAKERS IN 3 YRS(INCLUDING A STARBUCKS. BECAUSE WE ALWAYS THOUGHT,AND WERE OFTEN TOLD, THAT BUNN WAS THE BEST. IT COST US $15.00 TO SEND IT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER AND, MEANWHILE, HAVE TO GO WITHOUT COFFEE UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER ONE BACK. I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT THE LADY AT U.P.S. SAID THEY GET ALOT OF BUNN COFFEEMAKERS RETURNED AND SENT BACK. SO, THE DEAL WE THOUGHT WE GOT ON AMAZON FOR THIS WASN'T SUCH A GOOD DEAL."
2,24 hours a day!,"Please be advised IF you purchase this coffee maker that it MUST be left turned on 24 hours a day. The water in the reservoir will always be kept hot - thus the reason for the quick three minute brew. There is a ""vacation"" switch to deactivate the machine while you are away...and this should have been a warning to me. I only want to brew one pot of coffee per day. To leave the water hot continuously seems a great waste of electricity. Sorry to say, I returned the item."
2,After 3 Replacements I give Up,"I like the coffee maker but it is not designed to last. I have had three of the BT-10, they last about 14 to 16 months and then the tank heater fails. Bunn replaces it but the hassle is not worth it any longer. The problem is the heating unit, made in China, is on all the time and burns out with predictable regularity. It needs to have an auto shut off of the heating tank or an American made heating unit that will last. Another company should learn its lesson about China."
1,Leaks!,"We purchased our Bunn about four years ago. It makes good coffee; however, a $5 stove-top coffee maker from the thrift shop can do that!The carafe leaks. No matter how we hold it, it leaks a puddle of coffee every time we pour. We called Bunn and they told us that the seal was ""dirty"" with coffee oil residue. I cleaned it well per instructions and it *still* leaked. I sent it back to Bunn and they sent me another; that one leaked worse. I received yet another one (it might have been the original) and it leaked also (or, still).You can get a $15 unit from K-Mart that makes a good cup of coffee if you don't mind leaks... all in all, the cheaper one is by far the better deal, IMO."
3,"Fast, but not the best coffee.","Short and sweet. I bought this coffee maker for speed. And it delivers, on speed. Fastest cup of coffee going.But, it does not make the best coffee. You need to know this going in. The brewing system does not soak the beans log enough. You have to use more coffee to get the flavor. You are also somewhat limited in how much coffee you can actually put in the basket. The spray nozzle forces the coffee to form around the edges of the basket and this pushes the grounds very high up in this basket. Eventually they reach the top and you have grounds along the bottom of the top of the cofee maker (where the basket slides in).The carafe works well keeping coffee hot for a few hours.All in all I am a little disappointed with Bunn. IF they could just getting a better brew system combined with the speed......"
1,Needs to last longer,"We purchased this coffee maker in July 2007, here it is Jan 30 2011 and it's completely dead. I've had $30 coffee makers last longer than this. I expect at this price level and a name like BUNN, we would have gotten many more years out of it.I'll add this to the long line of products I'll never buy again that use a good name and then tarnish it with cheap junk."
5,BUNN THERMOFRESH,"I HAVE USED A BUNN FOR YEARS AND I LOVE IT. I BOUGHT THIS FOR A FRIEND. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU CHARGED SHIPPING ON THE FILTERS WHEN YOU ADVERTISED ""BUY THE PACKAGE"" THAT WAS SNEAKY."
4,Bunn Coffee Maker for the office,"Purchased the Bunn BTX-B Thermofresh for the office to replace a 18 year old commercial Bunn 2-burner coffee maker. Senior partner purchased the original maker and was very reluctant to part with it, but after several issues with leaking and loud noises, he agreed to the purchase of a new machine. After looking at several different makers, including many different brands, I was thrilled to see the Bunn Thermofresh. It works great. Even without preheating the carafe the coffee is still hot in the afternoon without any bitterness. The machine is easy to use and clean. So far everyone, including the senior partner, loves it. Lets see how long this one lasts."
2,so so coffee maker,The Bunn does not have the quality control in their products anymore.I guess they have to make things cheaper so some people will buy.The carafe does not keep coffee as warm as it should and the water in the well does not get hot enough to really brew the coffee. I am disappointed in this product. This is my fourth and last Bunn
3,OK coffee maker,"Well this is a fast machine. Coffee is made in 3 minutes but it will only stay warm in therms if half full for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I guess if I would make a full pot it would stay warmer longer but I tried putting hot water in it before I made the coffee but it still did not stay warm long. Other then that , it is a fast machine!"
2,"Good features, bad coffee!","I spent a lot of time trying to find the ""best"" coffee maker. I finally settled on a BUNN and liked the features of the BTX-B.Unfortunately, my wife and I like our coffee strong and this coffee maker cannot make a good strong cup of coffee. While the 3 minute brew cycle is neat, a timer can take care of that. And the 3 minute brew ensures that the coffee does not come out strong.The thermo carafe is awesome! and it's handy to have instant hot water in the kitchen for cooking/tea and other uses. But since I bought this unit for a coffee maker I expect good coffee.It's tricky to get water into the top, to get even a remotely strong cup of coffee you need a LOT of coffee (so it's expensive) and inevitably when you make a full pot the grinds overflow the oversized basket sides so some grinds end up in your coffee.Good idea - good machine - bad coffee. Sorry Bunn!"
5,Excellent product,We purchased this about one month ago - very satisfactory. Just make sure you properly measure your ounces of water before you pour it in. Otherwise perfect.
2,Brews coffe thats to hot to drink,Brews really fast but its to hot to drink. I have to put an ice cube in the first cup to be able to drink it. Decanter dribbles no matter how slow you pour. It doesn't seem to be able to make a real flavorful cup of coffee. I would have expected much more for this kind of money.
3,Approx 20 min & 2x to fill/18 min to brew from plugin to drink,"I returned it after reading the enclosed instructions. I know nothing about the quality of the coffee produced. The time required is why I returned it. If you have the time then you may be happy.For this household, this is a time consuming project not a in the morning out the door coffee maker. The ad on the page says 3 minutes but the instructions say different. The instructions assume that you would leave a heating element on in your house while you are not there. It wastes electricity and is a possible fire risk? ... I don't know. I have had one fire long ago due to a device being left on. Never again. I'm not taking the chance and I am returning it."
1,Horrifc,"This coffee maker was designed by high school freshman after smoking pot.1) Coffee grounds splash up on the roof of the base and collect there for a delightful, thick residue.2) The grounds residue sprinkles down into your clean grounds holder, or even the pitcher beneath if the lid is not in place. Ugh.3) The water is not heated sufficiently before being drawn through.4) The lid on the pitcher is laughable-- it dribbles, no matter what setting you use.5) The base does not warm the coffee--the coffee is supposed to remain hot in the insulated cannister. Right. It no worky.Test it yourself. Fill the pitcher and try to pour something. Dribble, dribble, puddle, slip, fall. Workers comp. Fired.This coffeemaker is designed for the show ""Punked"" by Ashton Kutcher. Soon you'll be mopping up the floor. I believe Bunn should accompany each new coffee-maker with a lifetime supply of paper towels, because, girl, you're gonna need 'em."
3,Bunn Coffee Maker,"This makes good coffee, so that is not an issue. What I don't like is the secondary water tank. You have two choices to make coffee, either leave the coffee maker plugged in and very hot water continuously (uses electricity constantly), or plug in when you're ready to make coffee, and wait about 20 minutes for the water to heat up. To me this is too much of a hassle. If I would have understood that I'd probably have picked a different coffee maker."
2,Not good,I wish I had read the reviews before buying this for my husband's birthday. He hated it and sent it back on day 3. He likes hot coffee and would rather have the burner keeping it hot than have to deal with his coffee being lukewarm in an hour and a half. I'm sure he didn't prewarm the carafe but he wanted easy 3 minute coffee with no hassles and this isn't it. We returned it and will be trying the one with a burner. this is also just awkward to use. The lid doesn't open with ease so if you have arthritis forget about it.
2,Mediocre at best,"Complicated coffee maker, requires keeping plug into wall socket forever or re-pluging it and waiting till the water in the tank heats up. Coffee when done tastes fine but why spend so much money or a machine that is mostly used in restaurants who keep it plugged in all the time to get coffee done in 5 minutes rather than 1/2 hour if kept unplugged. Very expensive."
2,Disappointment,I was very excited to receive the BUNN BT Velocity Brew 10-Cup Thermal Carafe Home Coffee Brewer it was a big disappointment and did not make near as good of coffee as my much less expensive maker
3,Awful carafe,"This is a great coffee maker, but the carafe is terrible. It's amazing they can make such a quality product and screw it up with something as simple as the carafe."
3,Expected it to be better,"I bought this coffee-maker because I knew Bunn is a good brand and because of the speed of brewing. I also liked the idea of a thermal carafe to avoid a ""burned"" taste after the coffee sat on a heated plate, as with standard coffee-makers.I was disappointed to find that, because of the way the Bunn system works, I am not able to make less than a full pot of coffee once and awhile. But more importantly, the thermal carafe is supposed to keep coffee hot for ""two hours minimum"" according to the package insert. That depends on what you consider ""hot"". I take my coffee black, but if you add cold cream to your coffee--drink fast!"
5,Bunn Thermofresh,We absolutely love the Bunn BTX-B Thermofresh coffee maker. Keeps the coffee fresh and hot for hours. I do recomend washing with Dawn dish soap before using. This will keep it from running down the side when pouring.
3,Leaking carafe,"Great idea and it's very nice not having to worry about turning a warmer plate off. This unit is used at an office that makes coffee at least once a day if not more, 5 days out of the week. Unfortunately, after about a month the pot started leaking where the plastic pour spout connects to the metal of the carafe. I haven't contacted Bunn yet so I have no input on their solution to this at the moment."
4,Bunn Coffee Brewer,"I like the fact I have coffee in a few minutes, but I have to agree with others if you pour too quickly, the pot leaks! Surely someone could redesign the pot!"
5,Finally!!!,"Finally Bunn got it right. After putting up with a leaky carafe on my old ThermoFresh, this new model doesn't drip when you pour either the water or the coffee. Thanks for making a great, drip free, cup of coffee!"
2,OK for what it's made for,"I read many good reviews for this coffee maker, but one thing that kept coming up is that it made weak coffee, we bought the BTX-B and we too found it made weak coffee. It is fast, but maybe it's too fast, the coffee doesn't really have time to brew, we experimented with the strength and found it takes almost two times the coffee we used in our old coffee maker (a cheap Mr. Coffee). I think if this is used in an office or a household that drinks coffee all day, this may be the machine for you. But for the morning coffee drinker, the heater is on 24/7 and uses a lot of power and it uses twice as much coffee, an expensive appliance to own."
1,Massive water leakage problem,My coffee maker is a year old now and leaking water every time I use it. My countertop is flooded with clear water every time I brew coffee! It doesn't leak coffee...just water! I won't buy another one!
1,Died after two years,"I bought this Bunn coffee maker just over two years ago. Everyone thought I was crazy for spending $120+ on a coffee maker. But I figured, rather than buy some department store cheapo model, I'd go top of the line and be set for decades. I defended it to friends as they noted the coffee wasn't hot enough. ""Well, you don't want it burnt"" I said. And they moaned as the carafe dripped all over the counter and floor as I said ""you didn't pour it right!"" And I moaned whenever it occasionally dumped most of the water all over my counter during brewing. All I could tell myself then was ""well, at least nobody was looking... stupid thing!"" But now, just 25 months later, the heating element is dead, and that's the end of that. My brothers bottom of the line Mr. Coffee is over 20 years old and still works like a charm. 'Nuf said..."
2,Water leaks out of coffeemaker,"I've had this coffeemaker between 2 and 3 years. The carafe started leaking when pouring after a short time, but I see that cleaning with a strong detergent would possibly have solved that problem. The coffeemaker is now discarded. Water started leaking out of the coffeemaker under the bottom and got worse until it was unusable. This is not acceptable for a unit that is no older than that and costs this much! A friend had a Bunn with glass carafe and said that hers developed a leak also."
1,Thermofresh Home Brewer,"I wish I had never ordered this coffeemaker. I love my old Bunn coffee makers and won't order any other brand...but it will NEVER be the thermo kind again. The coffee gets cold fast, and as there is no plate heater it's not for us. If you don't drink the whole pot in the first 10 minutes you have to heat your coffee in the microwave. The carafe leaks. ALSO, you can't tell if there is coffee in the pot or not...I really miss my old-style Bunn!"
2,6 months old and leaking,"I've been loyal to Bunn - my first lasted 6 years, the second 2 years, the latest did not even make it to 6 months. I noticed water collecting around the warming plate and thought I splashed when filling the reservoir. While I was looking closely hot water squirted out from underneath the top plastic filling part, but its not the sprayer. Glad I bought it with AMEX."
1,Its' stupid,"It's so stupid that there is no water reservoir indicator, so you have NO IDEA how much water is in there. Do you know what you have to do? You have to put a pitcher of water in, close the top, wait for 3 min. until that water goes in the reservoir, put in another pitcher of water, close the lid and wait for this water to go to the reservoir. You are to put an empty pitcher in the position so that any excess water from the reservoir is to drip into the pitcher. You must do this BEFORE you plug in/turn on the machine. Once THIS is done, you turn it on and you wait for the water to heat up. The manual said it takes 15 min. and it will start brewing. Well, mine doesn't start brewing after waiting for it to start for over 45 min. now. It is going back!!!"
4,not made in America,"The Bunn BTX-B Home Coffee Brewer makes a great cup of coffee or several cups if that's what you need. In fact, the heating system makes it possible to make multiple pots of coffee quickly one after the other. However, the main reason we chose this brand was because someone wrote that it was USA made and buying an American made appliance was our main priority. It turns out the Bunn coffee brewer we bought is assembled in the US with a carafe made in China. We couldn't figure out where the other parts of it were made."
1,No Barista would accept this!,"It makes the coffee so fast that it is missing some flavors and ""body"". The same coffee tastes better in a $20 machine. It is noisy and is VERY energy inefficient (it keeps the water at 200 degrees 24/7). I returned mine. In making coffee, speed is not the most important factor."
2,Suddently failed after two years of faithful service.,"This coffee maker performed very well for slightly over two years, until one morning when it suddenly and inexplicably failed without any warning. I suspect the heating element died since the maker no longer produces hot water. I suppose I will get to find out how good Bunn is when it comes to honoring a warranty claim."
3,Good but could be Better,"I have always loved Bunn Coffee Makers because they are fast and make a great cup of coffee so I was excited to see the ThermoFresh maker. I don't like reheated coffee so I thought this would be perfect. I have had it for over a month now, and the SMELL like something is burning that seems to come from the heating unit has finally lessened to a bareable level. I have never had that problem with any coffee maker and I read a ""chat"" here at Amazon about the smell so at least I didn't have to worry about something burning if I left the house. I bought the Bunn coffee filters after reading that they were taller and work better. Unfortunately, the coffee grinds still go above the top of the filter. Very very strange problems for a Bunn, and my Mom recently purchased the regular Bunn Coffee maker with no issues at all. Well, at least I still enjoy the convenience of having hot coffee for about 3 hours. I expected more from Bunn."
3,"Love the brand, hate the pot","Got online this morning to see if other's had the same problem with the thermal pot that we do. When you pour the coffee, a goodly portion leaks down the side of the pot and onto the counter. We've had Bunn coffee pots for years - they last and last and are quick to brew but this problem with our new machine is hard to fathom. Really, how long has civilization had to perfect the spout? You'd think this part would be simple."
1,Many flaws,I've owned a Bunn ThermoFresh Brewer for over a year. Don't bother purchasing this item. The carafe has a design flaw that causes coffee to spill onto the counter every time it is used. Bunn customer service says that it's a possible build up of oils from the ground coffee that is causing the leaky carafe. Their fix is a cleaning with warm water and soap. I've cleaned it numerous times but that is not the problem. The problem is pour design of the pouring spout. I thought Bunn was a quality item. Boy was I wrong. I will never purchase a Bunn product again. There are other issues with this item but not enough space here to elaborate. Do yourself a favor pass on Bunn.
5,"Fast, Fast, Fast",I have owned a Bunn home coffee maker for ten years. When my old one gave in to my coffee making demands I bought a new one with the Stainless stay warm carafe. I love it even more. The best coffee fast! When we have 11 and 12 house guests I can keep up with early morning caffeine demand easily.
5,"Simple, makes great coffee, does not leak","We have had the Bunn BTX-B for over a year. I really did a great deal of research before we bought it. When we got it I liked it at first but then the carafe started leaking and I took it back to the store. We bought a pod machine, hated it, went back and begged for the Bunn back. It is easy to use and makes great tasting coffee fast. It costs as much to make a pot of coffee as it did to make 2 cups of coffee in the pod machine. We recently bought a Capresso burr grinder and that improved the taste of the coffee even more. After a year of living with the leaky carafe I e-mailed Bunn and they sent me another carafe that was a different design. There is nothing you can do that will make the new carafe leak. What a great coffee maker!"
5,Best coffee maker ever!,"Absolutely love this coffee maker! We have owned 3 in the past 20 years. The best feature is not having to think ""did we turn of the coffee pot""? The carafe keeps coffee hot for many hours. You cannot go wrong with this one."
5,Taste Great and Stays Hot,"I have used various brands of ""Thermo"" coffee makers for years with satisfactory results but this Bunn product outperforms them all. I read a number of reviews on this product, prior to purchase, complaining that the coffee and grinds overflow. When I used bottled water during my initial use this also happened to me. However, as soon as I switched to tap water the problem disappeared resulting in the best tasting hot coffee I have ever expierenced. Use only Bunn filters and avoid soft water with a passion."
4,Good system but thermal pot soon begins to leak.,"We had another Bunn coffee pot which we loved. We wanted the thermal pot for our new one and it worked great for a couple weeks. However, then it started to leak around the rubber seals. We tried washing it well with dish soap but that doesn't cure the problem. We will have to contact Bunn for a replacement. We had read that this was a problem but thought they had designed a new pot, apparently NOT."
4,Great Coffee Maker,I really like this coffee maker. I owned a Bunn in the past but when it stopped working I opted for a less expensive one. Upon using it the first time I remembered how great it is not to have to wait 10-15 minutes for my coffee to be ready. I ran across this one and decided to spend the extra 100 bucks to have my coffee right now. I tell you I pour in the water and in less than 3 min. it is done. I was unsure how the thermal carafe would perform as I had a warmer on my first model. It works great. Keeps my coffee hot for hours without getting that burned old taste that a warming plate can give to coffee. Love this pot!
4,"A worthy addition to the ""Modern Western"" genre.","Not ""The Outback"" but actually set and filmed in the seldom-seen Southern Alpine region of South-East Australia. This film is well worth watching and more plausible than some think (see my ""Comment"" no. 3 under Steve Kuehl's critique on this page). Real political issues are woven into the film, such as the proposed high-speed rail line and restrictive highland access for cattle grazing. This gives more ""local"" edge to a tense, well-paced film. The only real inconsistency (to Australians) would be a ""shortage"" of Police vehicles requiring the main character having to go horseback to check-out a report on his first day.Anyone who enjoys this film should also consider ""The Proposition"", ""Dead Heart"" and ""Two Hands""."
4,"A modern-day, Aussie-flavored western","True Blood star Ryan Kwanten plays a young Shane Cooper, a constable on his first day on the job in a small town in Australia. When an escaped convict (Tom E. Lewis) returns to the town to wreck vengeance, Shane has to keep his wits about as he comes to learn that things truly aren't what they seem. What makes Red Hill so surprisingly enjoyable is that it is for all rights and purposes a modern-day western with an Aussie backdrop. The stand-offs, the final showdown, the dusty environment, and the gorgeous Australian outback; all of which combines to make for a surprisingly memorable thriller. Even more surprising is Kwanten, who after seeing him play an idiot for the past few years on Trube Blood, is a welcome change of pace to see playing an intelligent and heroic character. All in all, Red Hill is wholeheartedly worth your time if you're looking for an intelligent thriller."
2,Could have been better,"Red Hill is a modern day Aussie Western with a somewhat multilayered storyline.The film is weakened however by poor filming and shot selection i.e. it felt like the cameras shot drama rather than an action piece, with slow movement my main objection. There was also a lack of polish, as the burn scars makeup on the escaped Aboriginal convict looked cheap and unconvincing. The film budget presented as thin, and some of the actors looked out of place performing action genre.I did find myself entertained with some clever scenes though, in particular some diversionary tactics used by the escaped convict during a few shootouts.This isn't an Australian film I would recommend watching, as it reminds me of many bad Aussie films from the 1970s and 1980s. But it does have some strength to it, which includes twists in the narrative.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
4,"Entertaining, and I love the views","I saw this on a flight back from Australia. Definitely helped pass the time. It's one of those thriller-type movies where you wonder, ""Why doesn't he just _____?"" as all the victims seem incredibly unprepared and helpless even though they know they are in danger. However, the plot has a nice twist, there's a little bit of humor, and the setting is absolutely gorgeous."
2,A Modern Western from Australia,I am a Western fan and was intrigued by this film's trailer.The film is well-mounted with good actors and production valuesbut lacking a strong story line to make it a worthwhile film making.It is basically a revenge story of an aboriginal which storyline had been playedto death before.No suspense has been achieved by all the chasing and gunfightsbecause you don't know the victim that well and you don't care forany of the villains.And what is the significance of that black panther?A wasteful effort and viewer's time.
3,"3.5, almost, not quite","This movie almost got there. It truly has an old-fashioned Western feel, right down to the horses in the po-dunk town it's set in but it misses the mark by just a bit which is a shame because buried in the morass was a modern day western classic. Ryan Kwanten is on the verge of bleeding to death throughout most of the film, the townspeople evaporate at dusk it seems and seriously, the shortage of phones is just unbelievable. Don't get me started on the cheesy panther. But it's an entertaining film with good acting by Kwanten and the scenery is beautiful but I already mentioned Kwanten, ba dum dum. Really, Australia is fantastic looking. I won't say it's worth owning or even adding to your Netflix queue (well, maybe it is) but is defintely worth a rainy afternoon and a big bowl of popcorn if you find it on."
2,Wierdly Entertaining but Ridiculous.,"The acting, pacing and other elements of this film are good, however, the plot is ridiculous. The entire police force have the sense of a dried-up dog turd. The killer seems like an expert marksman except for times when the plot calls for him to just miss his target. So, as I'm watching this I'm thinking that it looks like good cinema and feels like good cinema, but it's a stupid story. Bummer, it could have been good."
1,Don't bother.,"This is a movie with good intentions. If you remember the quote from the Bible about good intentions, it will tell you about all you need to know.I was very disappointed in this movie. I would suggest that you don't waste your money on it."
5,The Best Water-Based Lube on the Market,If water-based lube is what you are looking for - this is the product for you. The headline says it all (read above)
5,Forever A Fan? Show it off!!,"This has to be the best totebag...EVER...Came new, holds my stuff for me, love it!!!"
2,Bad Stereo Mix,"The strings are cheesy, but that wouldn't bother me so much if the mix was better. This album is an example of a bad, early stereo mix. The vocals are only in one channel and mixed too quietly, while the overbearing strings are in the other channel and mixed too loudly. Frustrating, to say the least, especially since there is some great vocal work here on tracks like Deep In A Dream and Angel Eyes. The best way to hear this album is likely to track down a mono copy of the vinyl, unfortunately."
5,Great record of Great cellist at Great budget price,"The collection dosen't have Brahms's Cello Sonatas. But you picture her portrait by these 6 CDs( The cost is 7 dollars or less per one CD ). If you don't know what kind of cellist she was--yet, I want you to get it.You would meet extraordinary emitted passion by Du Pre in Elgar( needlees to say, it is one of her most famous performance), Saint-Saens, Dovrak( in spite of unskillful conducting of Barenboim), Schumann. The set has not only her famous performance of the Concertos in disk 1-3, but also various Sonatas( Barenboim makes excellent piano playing in good harmony with his wife more than support) in disk 4-6.Furthermore, the Bach's Cello Suite No.1 and No.2, as her only solo performance in this collection, are very interesting. Its passionate Bach(!!) is certainly like Du Pre.Thanks EMI FRANCE for the great work!!"
1,Not that great!,I really did not like this book. I didn't learn any useful tips. The writer mainly talks about his experiences in tomato growing but doesn't really offer any useful info.
3,Much Better things to come,"This is The Clay People's second cd and not their best. However there is an absolutley great track on this disk, ""Palegod"" is just one hell of an intence piece of industrial meyham and this album and one compilation (that I beleive is out of print) are the only places you can get this track, so If you like angry as hell music check this out."
4,"Fun, if bit dated","This is a fun and witty book; available for quite the bargain. It's a tad dated in comments and references, but still entertaining."
4,Very Smooth and easy to listen to while you work.,Very nice music and pleasing mood. I listen to it as background music while I work or when my mind needs a rest. The guitar is very clean and melodic. There's little fingers aerobic and contains lines you can hum to. The vocal and saxophone adds a nice touch and variety to this CD. If you like George Benson you should like this one.
3,Great first album!!,"This guy is a rising star. I recently had the chance to see him live in his hometown, Birmingham , AL and he was terrific. The album is smooth and engrossing, leaving nothing to the imagination. He also has a new release out on Capital Records. Check it out, its a jazz lover's dream."
5,Great little boy doll.,What a great and soft little boy doll. Hard to find a quality doll for a little man.:) Very pleased!
2,Short-lived,"The idea of Freeleash hands-free is GREAT! Since I am temporary handicapped, I'm using crutches for 4 months now. But it does not last long with an 80 lb dog. The metal pieces came apart after only 3 wear! I'm keeping the belt & using my dog's regular leash to put through the belt. So I dont have the chance to try the Extra Extention Leash which I can imagine would be ideal."
5,A Speakers Guidebook,"I will keep this book forever to reference when I have to speak in public. Very good tips, guides , and information."
1,Jennifer's Review,"I ordered this product but I received almost 3 weeks later. I wish I would have oreder it somewhere else, my classed are only five weeks long, and I didn't have my book for most of the course."
5,Great team for Osteoarthritis,"I've thoroughly enjoyed this tea while elevating my leg and icing my knee due to Osteoarthris! Also, this tea is soothing after doing P.T. exercises at the gym or at home. Thanks."
3,A historical review,"The book reprints most of the Nobel prize winner Bloembergen's work in the field of nonlinear optics. Those of the papers in this volume can be found in the library. However, with the author's commentary, one can understand the motivation and direction of each work and the interesting thing presented. For students and researchers in the field, it may not be much useful as the works came from early 60s to late 80s. The first few papers review the basic of nonlinear optics, which are suitable for the new fresher. The book contains much work on topics in the past, but not the current ""heat"" one. Therefore, it's not useful for the active researchers in the field. But for those who are interested in the development from the past to present, you can have some insight from it."
5,Delay-pedal flair&#65533;,"U2 may have put emphasis on the stylish technique first, but Disco Inferno crafts the sound more fluid-like and less predictable. It's a music marvel, really. It's like watching Mercury dance-liquid, reflective, and glossy, the type of reverie that left you captivated for months as a child. There's a few conditions though: buy it, listen closely, and give thanks to yourself or the humble genius that recommended it to you."
4,"Engrossing, like all of Andrews' works","The second of the ""Flowers in the Attic"" series, I believe, is the best book in the aforementioned series. It tells of Cathy's incline in the world of ballet, her affairs, and the bitterness she harbors towards her grandmother, her mother, and her mother's betrayal. She wants revenge on the two and will stop at nothing to gain it, but even better is the longing that Chris has for her, and her passionate relationship with another prominent ballet dancer, Julian. I enjoyed this book, and I most definitely recommend it for anyone looking into VC Andrews."
5,Heartwrenching,This is the first novel that has ever brought me to tears. I will never ever forget those four fictitous children. This book is a masterpiece!
4,Exciting!!!!!!!!!,"OUt of all the V.C. Andrews series, this is my favorite. I love the Dollanganger family. It's thrilling, and keeps the reader interested page by page. I recommend this book to anyone lost for love and enjoys adventures."
5,"If you read Flowers in the Attic, you have to read this",I was captivated by Flowers in the Attic and so had to read this. It answers a lot of questions left by the first book and develops the story further.
1,nowhere near a literary masterpiece,"I thought this book was pure, without a doubt, trash! The writing is horrible. The plot is all about incest. How can anyone think a sexual relationship between two siblings is beautiful? If you want a literary masterpiece, try a classic..."
5,Revenge is sweet,"What a great sequel! The book swept me away so fast that by the time I finished it I looked around, not knowing where I was! Deliciously wonderful. I felt Cathy's anger and wanted to get revenge on her mother just as much as she did. I especially enjoyed the part where she walks downstairs in her mother's green dress, one she wore(not so coincidentally)years ago at the Christmas pary. Great."
5,A wonderful book but dont expect it to be a dilligent sequel,"I loved this book every bit as much as I loved flowers in the attic but in a very different way.This book is not a horror story like the first one is.Its still very sad though.This book picks up where the other left off and tells the story of what happend to the ""Dolls"".If you fell in love with the kids in the first book this is a must read.Its good to able to see what happened to them and fall in love with them all over again."
4,Quite interesting,"I must say that this novel was quite good. I absolutely love Flowers in the Attic since it's a tragic tale that I truly hope no person would suffer. Petals on the Wind did a great job of describing some of the real consequences that happens to people when they are mistreated during their childhood. Childhood traumas, especially that of Catherine's, is something that I'm glad VC Andrews was able to explain in truth. VC Andrews did such a good job in describing each character that I too felt as if i were part of the novel. For example, I couldn't help but pitty Carrie, I wanted to tell Chris to just grow up, I desperatly wanted to yell at Cathy to just get her revenge over with, and I really wanted to kill Julian (he was really annoying). But hey, that just shows that Andrews knows how to get her readers involved.This is a book that should not be missed!"
5,Great BOOK,"This book is amazing, perfect second half TO the original!!I loved it. It's a little sadder than the first one to me"
3,Its okay....,"I liked the first book because it seemed to be a lot more real then book 2. The 2nd book seemed to be thought up and fake, which i know it is but it seemed too unreal. This is just my opinion, i know others who did like it. I had a very hard time getting though the book. I would recommed the first book but not the 2nd. I will not be continuing the series."
4,A spitfire of revenge and hate...,"Petals on the wind...a revenge packed rampage to the bitter end. A very well put together book that carries the ""Dresden Dolls"" into their adulthood years and Cathys building tower of revenge and hate for her mother and grandmother. I read this book within a matter of 3 days knowing that with each turn of the page I was one page closer to the confrontation and destruction of Foxworth Hall. Even though it was an exceptionally well written masterpiece and still a must read, it's not as good as the first book...but then again nothing ever is."
4,A bit out there!,"This book was very good, but it was a bit far fetched. I was like she started writing this book in a dream state. I d also didn't like how they grew uup so fast in the book. It was like one mnute there fifteen, and the next she's thirty-six. It was very hard to keeo track of the age. But nonetheless it was still a very good book. A very intersting novel."
2,Disappointing...,"I read this book because I wanted to know what happened after Flowers in the Attic, which was a good read. This book, however, was a disappointment. 70 percent of it was Cathy having sex with someone (which she does a lot of in this book, with more than a few partners) or starting to have foreplay and then slapping him in the face and storming out. This book was bad. I'm glad I checked it out from the library and didn't buy it. I really do not care enough about Cathy's sex life enough to read about it in every chapter of a book. Not to mention her incessant self-doubt, worrying, and wimpy questioning of herself on whether or not she is the ""Devil's issue."" Get over it! And the revenge against the mother came much too late in the book. Furthermore, I was really turned off by the way Cathy is constantly telling the reader how beautiful she thinks she is. If you are looking for a good sequel full of interesting plot, substance and content, this one is not it!"
2,I CANNOT believe VC Andrews wrote this!,"Please tell me it's a lie! This is the most immoral book I've ever read. Cathy is simply sick. She had to have been mentally ill to do the things she did in this book. She went way to far. Sleeping with your MOTHER'S HUSBAND is NOT the way to get revenge. BEATING YOUR GRANDMOTHER despite her earlier cruelty is NOT the way to get revenge. All it took to get revenge was to tell the people who she was, make her sick mama go as broke as a bag lady and maybe Bart Winslow would break up the marriage as the real Corrine was revealed. That was all it took to stir a controversial uproar. And after the last paragraph, I'm too afraid to know what happens in the next book."
3,"Interesting read, Kindle edition too full of typos","The read/story itself isn't too bad. Not as good as Flowers in the Attic but an interesting read itself. Nice to tie up the story.The Kindle version was so full of typos that it was distracting and took away from the read for me. Eventually, I figured out what the random $$ stood for, and what the typos were SUPPOSED to be but it interrupted the flow of the story from me so I feel like I might not be reviewing it fairly. I'm most bothered by the 1's in place of l's I think. I just can't past that.Please, please, please fix the Kindle edition Amazon! You rarely disappoint me, but this time..."
1,Absolutely AWFUL Kindle edition - DO NOT BUY!!!,"The Kindle edition of this book is full of horrific errors generated by scanning the book and then leaving all of the OCR errors uncorrected. I'm appalled at just how many errors there are and how many passages are completely incomprehensible as a result. DON'T buy the Kindle edition! If you want the book, buy a physical copy or you will be flushing your money down the toilet. This is the worst proofreading job I've EVER seen in a Kindle, and everybody involved in bringing it to market should be ashamed. Or, better yet, fired."
4,good book,"I started off with Flowers in the attic, being as it is the first book, and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to get the follow up, v.c. andrews is a great writer, but sometimes its a bit confusing. You should give these books a shot, very worthwhile!"
2,Don't waste your money,"Cathy Dollanganger goes from being a good kid with a good head on her shoulders to becoming a messed up, desperate basket case! This book drags on and on about her dysfunctional relationships with men before finally getting to her revenge on Corrine. Check it out at your library if you really need to read it, but save your money to purchase one of Andrews' better works."
3,Cathy of the Attic does not fit the real world,"The book in which the four Dresden dolls finally escape was disappointing. Yes, I was expecting horror galore, but this was ridiculous. I understand that Cathy had to experience terrible things in order to prove she could overcome them, but this girl turned into a conceited psycho. I'll admit she is strong, and was a good mother to Carrie and her children, and I understand her feeling of revenge (who couldn't?) but she who supposedly cared for Chris so much and wanted him to have a normal life, really broke his heart and would not let him find another. I really did not like any of the weak male characters either. The pattern of this book was odd--but I will give it this it wasn't boring, and the Flowers series really makes you think."
5,Best Baby Blanket,"I received the child to Cherish blanket as a baby shower gift and never thought much about it until my son turned 4-months. I gave it to him to hold while in his carseat. He loved it. He rubs the silkie part against his face and easily drifts off into a nap. He is now almost 7-months old and needless to say we cannot go anywhere without it. We purchased 2-additional blankies so that we always have a clean one on hand. Also, because it is so small (less than 1 sq foot)it travels well. I would definitely recommend this baby blanket if you are looking for something super soft to help soothe and lull your child to sleep."
2,Weak album lacks focus,"I've been following the career of Peter Case since I first fell in love with his early 80's power-pop band The Plimsouls. Peter's post-Plimsouls solo work has seen highs and lows but anyway you look at it, Six Pack Of Love isn't a very good record. My major complaint is the record's unfocused artistic vision and lack of true inspiration. Stylistically, this hodge-podge mix of songs is all over the map...Beatleish pop rock, blues, novelty songs, folk, etc. And even that would be ok if any of it felt truly inspired. But despite the frantic efforts of producer Mitchell Froom to dress it up, there's not much on Six Pack Of Love that inspires any emotion in the listener. This is just music for music's sake and it feels pretty empty."
3,Great Songs Ruined By Steven Hague. Typical.,"Although the Banshee sound is almost completely lost here (it's lush and comtemplative rather than rash and neurotic,) Superstition could have boasted the band's most melodically appealing songs were they not drowned within Steven Hague's claustrophobic production. The layers of synthesizers and dance floor beats were obviously designed for a swirling wall-of-sound effect but serve only as a distraction, however every song still captivates underneath the confusion.Best Tracks: Kiss Them For Me, Little Sister, The Ghost In You"
4,Atmospheric acid without the drugs,"Although it's arguable that the Banshees EVER made an 'perfect' album, this one would probably come closest to it. It's somewhat overproduced, with a distinctly Indian sound to it, but in a year (1991) of underwhelming albums by overwhelming artists, well worth a try. 'Little Sister' and 'The Ghost in You' are particularly moving."
2,Critics are worthless.,"The poor taste and judgment of so many critics is never more evident than in the fact that so many of them prefer this Banshee album. In fact, as any true Banshee fan worth their salt (or their eyeliner, for that matter) will tell you, this album is a waste of anyone's money, the absolute anti-zenith of an otherwise great discography.Lyrically, the Banshees must have been doped up on boredom when they wrote these songs. ""Cry"" and ""Fear""? Not exactly the kind of great stuff the ""Kaleidoscope"" LP was made of.While the album has its decent intentions, and even some partially redeeming songs (""Kiss Them For Me"" or ""Drifter""), most consumers should probably skip over this one, just as most fans try to forget it ever happened."
3,It's not bad,"To me this album just does'nt meet up to my standards of what a good Siouxsie album is. I mean, it's really not that bad but it's definently not the group's best. it has a few good songs on it but some of the songs like 'Kiss them for me' and 'Silly thing' Ruined this album for me."
4,The poppy side of goth,"Siouxsie goes pop on this album, and at first, I thought it stunk, with the exception of ""Kiss them for me,"" but the more I listened to it, the better it sounded. Not one of the all-time greatest albums or anything, but a nice, more accessible approach to Siouxsie and the Banshees. If Paula Abdul or some other Top-40 siren released this album, it would have been hailed as a masterwork of contemporary music. Because S and the Bs are capable of better, we make the mistake of thinking that this isn't good enough."
3,Good but not their best,"I bought it for the hit ""Kiss Them for Me,"" and it turns out that no other songs really hold me. A great band, from their punk roots to the later more refined and experimental stuff. I think they reached a zenith with their ""Peepshow"" album. Also Siouxsie's (2007) solo ""Mantaray"" album is great."

1,"Blah, Blah, Blah,...","My favorite band of the eighties: phenomonal voice, fantastic music, and a theatricy unmatched. I dub this the ""sellout album,"" and it worked; it got them on the original Lolapalloza tour. It sounded to me like she wanted to have her music played in clubs; that just isn't Siouxsie to her fans. She once said in the interview that even though she thought her band could have done some good music with synthisizers, she opted for the band not to use them so the band wouldn't become branded ""New Wave."" She was right, but now this album produced in the nineties sounds like club music. I love Siouxsie, and there are MANY other albums that showcase her band's strengths. Use your cash elsewhere."
3,Dissapointed,I have to say I'm a little upset with there new cd. It isn't as heavy as the last. The songs are slower and lighter. A lot of this is due to the lead singer who blew his vocal cords during there tour. He said that it was time to slow down a little bit. There other cd's are so much better. If you liked there other cd's there's a big chance you won't like this one and if you didn't like Soil then this cd might be the change that you wanted to see. There's some good songs on here but it just doesn't compare to songs like Halo. You might want to give this cd a try but you've been warned.
4,"This CD is okay but not as good as ""Scars"".......",Scars is absolutely the best SOiL cd right now. This CD is better than Throttle Junkies though. My favorite songs on this CD are:- Pride- Cross My Heart- Redefine- Remember
4,Surprised,All the other review's before mine gave this CD 1 star... I don't know what they are thinking! If you're a fan of any kind of rock you will love this CD. After reading all the bad reviews for this CD I was very very surprised how wrong they were when I actually got it! I really liked Scars and actually am not a big fan of this genre but in my opinion Soil did a great job with this one. Redefine isn't as good as Scars but is still a good album. There is only one reason why I didn't give this CD 5 stars - some of the tracks do have a similar sound but then again what band doesn't have some songs that sound alike?
1,You might be a redneck.....,"This is not a metal album as some of you reviewers are calling it. This is hard rock (at it's worst). This album sounds like all the other garbage polluting the radio these days. The majority of the songs on this CD sound exactly the same and they do get old fast. Yet another rock album for really dumb people. Don't waste your money, just download the songs if you want a listen."
4,Redefine,"Soil hasn't redefined anything on their follow-up to 2001's Scars, but they didn't need to either. Scars was quite an enjoyable slab of hard and heavy anthemic rock, and Redefine does nothing more than tighten the pace and focus. Right out the gate, Soil belts out some of the best songs of their career thus far, with Pride, Remember, and Cross My Heart of considerable note. The band starts to lose their touch near the end with filler tracks like Something Real and Say You Will, but the drop in quality is mercifully short as the band kicks back into high gear for the closing tracks. Although music lovers expecting a more varied listen might be a little disappointed, those in the mood for a powerful guitar assault will find all they are looking for in Soil's Redefine."
4,A good metal album,"The first song I heard from REDEFINE was PRIDE, it is on the Madden 2004 soundtrack. That song rocks, so when I had the chance, I went out and bought the CD. I can say that I am totally pleased with my choice. This Cd just rocks, and unlike alot of bands, SOIL doesnt seem to be doing what is popular. The music is hard and the lyrics are good and this album should do real well. My favorite songs from the cd are PRIDE, CROSS MY HEART, SAY YOU WILL, REMEMBER and SUFFERING. If you are a fan of metal or hard rock, then I suggest that you add this disc to your collection. I dont think you will be disappointed."
1,Redefine = RETARDED!!!!!!!,"Hey Ya'll, all 36 of you inbred people from redneck states( You know who you are) should stop spending you life savings on this re-hashed Godsmack junk and start putting some shoes on your(12) kids feet! Or perhaps you could put an addition on the camper you call home!! In all seriousness,Soil lacks any shred of decent creativity! This C.D. would only appeal to three types of people! 1. Soil family members who lie and tell them its great! 2.People who think J-Lo has a hot ass! 3.People who think Godsmack,7-Dust and Creed are great bands!! P.S. To Soil, Nice brainstorm on that C.D. cover!!............IDIOTS!!! Hey, How long did it take you guys to come up with the one word song titles? I suggest you whip out that cool looking type writer and practice!"
2,A good book but very out dated.,"I am sure this book was awesome, about 5 years ago. But when I received this book in the mail I was very dissappointed to find that it was published in 2000 and doesn't seem to have been updated since despite being listed as March 2005 on this site. The currency isn't even in euros, it's in the old Greek currency. And with all of the changes to Greece since the olympics this book is absolete."
4,Update,It was a simple matter to fix the brake line once I figured it out. Took the bike for a ride yesterday and it performed very well. I would definitely recommend this bike to anyone looking to try out biking but does not want to spend a lot of money.
3,Hard to Assemble,"I just got the bike and have not ridden it yet, but Huffy has one instruction manual for all of its bikes so it is hard to figure out how to assemle it. I finally got it assembled correctly (I hope), but the cable leading from the front break to the left handle bar is out of the handle bar socket and I have no idea how to put it back in. I may have to take it to a bike shop.Its an inexpensive bike and seems to be constructed well, but the hastle to assmble it is a pain."
4,Excellent Tips followed by clear visual demonstrations,"A highly informative guide covering providing excellent tops for avid fishermen. The video presented clear, accurate tips followed by actual visual demonstrations. Covered hooks, reels, artificial lures, jigs, electronic fishfinders."
5,dumb beats!,"by no stretch of the imagination is this one of the best rap albums ever made. i was blown away when i first heard ""you ain't fly"" and to say it mildly the rest of the album does not disappoint either. the roots are musical geniuses, by far transcending most of their colleagues in the world of rap."
4,The roots are Tight!,"This album is much more instrumental and jazzy than the other Roots albums. Distortion to Static, What Goes On, I Remain Calm are the best songs on the disc, with What goes on showcasing. But Proceed, Mellow My Man, Datskat and Silent Treatment are good as well. Compared to Roots satndards, some of the songs are not as dynamic as some of the others, but compared to other artsist, their great. I wouldn't buy this album for a fan who is new to the Roots. I would start with things fall Apart, and work my way backwards.Then you could better appreciate the creative and unique music on this disc, cause after all, it is 6 years old, even the instramental sound give it a sense of timelesness. You'll be kickin yourself asking what you've been missing."
4,purely the roots of hip-hop,"the roots are a group who have never let there listeners down, a group who have experimented with many instruments and creating ideas which many others would dare dream about, the beauty is that these individuals are creating new music that is nothing other then sensational, do you want more has a bit for everybody including the heads who just can't come to grips with hip-hop, if you have heard the released tracks from this album e.g. proceed, silent treatment.......and you liked it (which i know you would) then don't be afraid to lay down the money for an album of a group like no other, these guys are good."
5,South Philly in The house...,"i was a skeptic roots fan at first. this changed very soon after hearing ""Things Fall Apart."" After TFA i got my hands on ""Illadelph Halflife"". Then ""Do You Want More?!!!?!"". Then last but not least ""Organix."" ""Do you...""is my favorite, The rapping by the roots is great and the band is amongst the best...i think each Roots album has a different feel, this feel is my favorite but the others are NOT to be overlooked by anymeans. This album is relaxed and soothing but not as laid back as ""Illadelph"". But the band's songs are not as hip hop geared as ""TFA""...""Do you"" almost sounds like a jazz album. My recomendation is get The Roots albums in this order. (TFA, Do You, Illadelph, Organix). For more in depth reviews on the other albums by me check their review sections.NOTE:I have not heard any of Phrenology and therefore did not include it in my review, this by no means means you should conclude it's not worth getting...try it out and see what u think."
5,one of the best...ever,"If you're a neophyte or a long-time fan of hip-hop, this album has something to offer. By far the best example of the boundaries of hip-hop, ""Do you want more???"" is the opus of the Roots. Not to say that their other albums don't hold muster (because they do), but this was truly the best the collective had to offer. The anthem of the Roots is ""What goes on,"" which combines the talents of their drummer, ?uestlove, their then-beat boxer Rahzel (since aptly replaced by Scratch) and their MCs, Black Thought and Malik B to create a world of rap in which one could exist forever. Other notable songs on the album include ""Mellow my man,"" which exemplifies the tempo changes that are the hallmark of jazz, ""The lesson,"" a freestyle-type song over an incredible beatbox courtesy of Rah, and ""Distortion to static,"" one of those songs that becomes an immovable force in one's head. If you love music and creativity, this is the one album you must own."
3,Pretty good,"As a musician, DJ and a hip hop afficianado, I enjoy listening to these guys. Tariq is a top-shelf, A-class lyricist, while Amhir is wondrous on the percussion. My complaint with this album is the same as my complaint with the first one, Organix. It just doesn't grab me like the rest of the catalog does. To me it seems as though they are still finding themselves creatively. There some excellent tracks here (e.g. Distortion to Static, Silent Treatment) but the coherence isn't quite there. That said, this is STILL a necessary part of the collection, as it offers itself as a prelude to their excellence in the years to come."
4,more..? yes please...!!!,"My order came today and i'm listening to this album for the first time while writing this review. 4 songs in and i'm head boppin' and toe tappin like a lunatic! It is so good, definitely jazzy and chill. I have Things Fall Apart and The Tipping Point albums but with my first listen of Do You Want More? about to conclude, i dare to say it's my favourite Root's album. Thanks to Amazon for an efficient delivery, much love from Singapore!"
5,"Yes, I would like some more.,,...,...,.","This is my favorite Roots album, despite the fact that seemingly everyone in the universe worships Things Fall Apart, which is also a very good album. But on Do You Want More, The Roots create a chill out jazzy vibe that I have never been able to find again on any other hip-hop album. This album is a great listen, either on your headphones or as background music in your living room. I just wish The Roots would drop the guitars and go back to the jazzy beats full time. Of course, they probably wouldn't have as many MTV videos if they did that, so hey, do your thing."
2,"It had me on the edge of my seat, but ...","it wasn't what I expected. I didn't realize that there were two movies with this title, so great, now I have to watch the story over again when I see the other movie. Well, that's my problem, so why do I only give it 2 stars? I liked the suspense and it did capture my interest, however, I was upset that the movie continually used a child as a centerpiece of suspense when, in fact, a child was never threatened.I understand that as a parent you wouldn't know if your child may be endangered, but the movie makers knew the story and they exploited the role of a child to help their movie. That bothers me.Look, I lived through an actual serial killer spree here in the D.C. area including one killing in front of a store my family frequently shopped. I know what it means to be afraid for your child and it is insulting to have a child used in this manner. If it was only a small part of the movie, then I'm not upset, but this was the entire movie."
2,just all right,"This was pretty much standard stuff, very much by-the-numbers. It did, however, creep me out a lot because I had made the mistake of watching it right before I went to bed."
2,"good, but no cigar","This was the first movie I saw on the Zodiac killer. It was rather suspenseful (since I was not familiar with the story) and mysterious. Yet, I don't think this is truly the movie that the Zodiac killer had meant to be the perfect movie about him."
1,The worst martial arts book since Karate for Dummies,"This is the first martial arts book that I have seen that has next to no worthwhile content. The information contained within is little more than the most basic martial arts knowledge combined with a lot of photography. The best part of the book is the abbreviated history of the Pai Lum style, though better, more accurate information can be found on wikipedia for free. Nearly every 5 star review is by a person whose name appears at the back of the book under the instructors list. Don't drink the koolaid, this book is a joke.On a positive note, the photography does show off the impressive uniforms of the Pai Lum Tao practitioners, studded leather gauntlets and matching belts. very nice!"
2,"disappointment, I don't understand other ratings","When I received this book I was all hype over what I had read here. Apon opening its pages and going through it one will discover sparse information as if it had been hastily written and pumped out. Most of the book (around half) is pictures. And being a practitioner of kung fu (pi lum tao, bak ga) I found some of the stances a little off. I know I never hit every stance perfect, but if I were making a book, then I'd make sure they were practically perfect. Either the authur isn't so good a writer or I was expecting too much from this book."
4,"Mahogany Shelf 48""",The order received was in good condition and as was pictured. The only thing that would have been nice or improvement that could be made is to also have a mounting spot in the middle of the shelf or an additional bracket due to the long length and the potential for putting too much weight on it and making it bow or sag in the middle.
3,lousy hanging setup,"I ordered 8 of these to display a collection of framed poems. The color of the stain was beautiful, although there were curious ""overspray"" patterns on 6 of the shelves. The hanging holes on the back of the shelves really need some improvement. They DO NOT do the job and we had to buy metal brackets to screw onto the backs and hang onto the wall with these. I had read about this problem on some of the reviews and they were right-on. Nice quality wood shelves but don't think you will be able to hang them up using the existing hole set up on the backs."
3,Good product,"I received the product as advertised and the quality is good. All the parts fit properly and it filters well, however the filter clogs very quickly. I have gone back to using the hard plastic prefilter."
4,Good Replacement for Original,"Does the job. If it were larger (more surface area)and a little more rigid, the time between cleaning could be lengthened considerably. Not too bad though. In our pond, we get about 2 weeks or more in the summer, an easy month in the cool weather."
1,Rip off..,you can find this for $10 elsewhere. Don't buy!!! Amazon should be shamed for even listing this.
4,boat tarp,i bought this as a gift. It seems to be pretty durable. My brother thought it was good quality. it was his gift. We will see how it performs over the year. I would reccommend this product based on what we have seen so far.
4,I used St. Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub ...,"I used St. Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub every morning and every night before bedtime. I noticed a significant increase in the softness of my skin. It left my skin feeling smoother throughout the day. It helped tone out my combination skin, making the oilier parts less oily and the drier parts less dry. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs help beginning an easy skin-care program, and who doesn't have the time to use multiple products but wants to be able to wash their face and go."
4,pupplesnuff,"A good exfoliator but, a little on the harsh side. Use lots of water with it. I bought a 12 oz. tub 3 years ago and still haven't used it all."
5,This is a St. Ives product that I'll ...,This is a St. Ives product that I'll definitely purchase again! The apricot scent is GREAT (certainly not one of those facial cleansing products that you can't stand the smell of!) and it really leaves your face clean and fresh. This product seemed to cleanse and moisturize my skin better than other products I've tried. I've always been a fan of St. Ives shampoos and now I'm certainly adding this product to my list. I'll recommend it to my friends and family.
4,"A good album, but not his best.","John Hiatt is the voice that has not been heard by many. He is a great songwriter and has a unique vocal style that doesn't bore you. This album, while very good, is not his best. But, songs like ""Death By Misadventure"" ""She Loves The Jerk"" and ""Girl On A String"" are better than most songs that more popular artist release. You can't go wrong if you purchase this CD. It is that good."
2,Tired,"I bought this after seeing Hiatt open for B.B. King and reading the glowing reviews here. The show was quite good, a high-powered, growling, energized performance of a man with wit, charm, and talent.But this sounds like sleep-walking in comparison. Clearly people like this music, but to these ears, from those first mechanical techno Smoke On The Water notes, the whole thing is limp and dull.There is some good writing in here, but with the dreary music to accompany it, I can't imagine I'll be giving it a lot of attention. Maybe I'll just read the lyric sheet."
4,Good one for the price,"i have had this camera for about 3 weeks now and just love the convenience of carrying one device for both video and still pictures. its also lighter and smaller than my other devices. its very easy to use. picture quality is good in daylight or well lit area. it gets grainy in the dark and does not look great especially when viewed on an HD TV. audio is ok, zoom is basic. i usually just walk closer to my subject instead of zooming as i get better audio capture. still pictures are great and the flash works fine. battery life is good and i love the fact that i can charge it with a USB cable or one of many usb chargers i have for the cell phones.overall it is a good buy for the price."
3,A nice little gadget for the money,"Not the most reliable, stable piece of equipment, but what do you want for the pricetag? I'd say it's a very amusing gadget and I'm prepared to see how far this little thing can go. This actually has an optical zoom, unlike the other models that have a ""digital zoom"" (completely useless as far as I'm concerned). The biggest minus is the sound - it's outright horrendous. Manual override with the other functions is not easy to implement. Picture wise it's a nice achievement, 720 P video for such a low price."
1,Bad Audio; Bad video; Bad still picture,"I have owned this camcorder for nearly six months. It has been a very disappointing purchase.The audio gets very scratchy at times. I have seen this happening when recording musical programs where there is continuous loud audio. Video quality is so-so. In the name of HD, it creates huge video (.MOV) files, but the videos that I capture from my Sony MiniDV camcorder (in DV format) are much better in clarity and quality. The zoom is almost useless because of the absence of steady-shot feature. Even with a tripod, I have seen the video quality reduces with zooming, though it shouldn't happen with the optical zoom.Still pictures: It is very easy to mess up a picture. Half of my still pictures come out to be out-of-focus or shaken.If you are not in a hurry to go HD and if you are considering this camcorder because of the attractive price, WAIT... I can see that the Sonys and Canons are coming down on price."
4,Very Very Nice,"CAmera is very small and produces an amazing picture for the price. The only faults in it are no auxillary audio input and the internal mic is weak and due to its small size, it can be shaky if you arent careful with it, but for the price it really has nothing that compares to it. I highly recommend it for a pocket camera. I am extremely happy with it."
1,Aiptek GO-HD - BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"I purchased a GO-HD a month ago. The flash unit packed up on the first day and the camcorder does not switch off when closing the screen or pressing the power sitch, requiring the battery to be removed to power the unit off. When it was working, the zoom makes grinding noises which gets captured by the mic.I sent emails to Aiptek USA & Taiwan sales, support & marketting dept's and have not recieved a reply since, indicating their total lack of commitment to product support.If you are happy to accept this $250 ""Throw Away"" camcorder, buy it and take your chances."
2,GO-HD 720P,"well,Just received it last night. Packaged well, as always from Amazon. The camera feels really cheap (buttons, screen, etc.)So, i receive it, charge the batteries and shoot a sample... plug the SD card in my pc... results:Video was ok (just ok, but it was indoor, well lit), but sound was horrible. Turns out the VLC player does't play the sound right, and with all the comments about bad sound, i figured it was just the way it was...I later tried it on my laptop which has quicktime and it came out much better (what a relief:, but still very average )I will have to try it more during the day, to see if it is worth anything...my thoughts are; maybe it is 720p, but its sound quality is subpar, and build quality is cheap, then is this really such a bargain??still not sure whether is should get a refund and dish out the extra cash for a decent HD camcorder.Overall, pretty disapointed..."
1,Broke after only 3 weeks!!!!!!!!!!,I only used about ten minuets of this camcorder and POOF it's toast. The zoom won't work and the screen is so dark I can't see anything; yes I tried different setting but it's not the settings it's the piece of [...] camera! [...]. Now I can't return it because this seller's policy is 14 days. BEWARE!!!!!!!!
4,Great product for low price,"The camera works as advertised. It is portable, light weight, easy to configure, comes with a handy bag.The only con is battery life. If you are planning to record a 3 hour long event, forget about this one.[...]"
2,A little disappointed,"1. I really liked how easy it was to operate, but the HD isn't as ""HD"" as I thought it would be. Also, it's very difficult to hold steady.2. The zoom quit working on it 3 weeks after we got it.3. I took three movies with it the other night, and only one of them shows up on the computer. Then, when I checked the camera, it still has all three movies, but no computer I can find anywhere sees the other two movies...only the first one.4. I called and emailed AIPTEK for help - still haven't heard from them, and that was 30 days ago. I wish I would have sent it back to Amazon. It started having problems at about the 28 day point, and I figured AIPTEK would help me with it.I really wanted it to work. We're disappointed, and now I'm back to trying to work with AIPTEK."
2,TWO MONTH EXPERIENCE,"This is my two month experience. My reference experiences are a 12 year old Sony 8 mm tape camcorder (a pain to haul around) and a two year old Nikon 5 MP digital still camera (easy to pocket). The biggest aggravations with GO-HD are: the motor noise of auto-focus and zoom transferred to the sound; the lack of image stabilization. Lesser problems are: light level drops with zoom; reddish cast with auto white balance; poor still images. I haven't tried the HD video because of the above problems combined with the megabyte consumption. In summary, this camera promises more than it can deliver. On the other hand, it is very handy and easy to pocket. I will continue to use it for close-up, candid, less-professional situations. In retrospect, I should have purchased the less expensive Aiptek MPVR+ (which has image stabilization) and waited for HD on a better camera."
3,TURN OF FAITH,"BEYOND REDEMPTION is a stylish, noir-like thriller featuring former bratpacker Andrew McCarthy.A serial killer is knocking off what appears to be philanthropists, not withstanding a hooker whose john pays her 15,000 before offing her. Atheist detective McCarthy is placed in charge of the case, an interesting paradox--an atheist investigating religiously themed murders. Along with his Jewish partner (Matthew Laurance), McCarthy at first suspects another priest and then is even more horrified to find his younger brother may be a suspect. Meanwhile, his young daughter is facing life-threatening bone marrow surgery, and is questioning him about death and heaven. Michael Ironside appears as Alexander Hunt, a billionaire whose philanthropic niceties makes him a possible future victim.BEYOND REDEMPTION has good intentions, but its ending is contrived and a faux climax doesn't help things out. Still, the cast does well and it is moody and threatening. Not a classic but you could do worse."
2,I now know why this only cost me $2.99,"An atheist cop (Andrew McCarthy), who lost his faith in God after a bust gone wrong, finds himself pitted against a serial killer who is effectively challenging God to try to stop him.I bought this film for $2.99 at a discount store and now I know why the DVD was so cheap. This films starts off well and had me interested for most of its duration, but it was let down by a barely coherent ending that, after 36 hours of thinking about it, I still don't get. Based on the plot summary, you might think that this is a Christian propaganda film, but it's not. It's just a normal film with some religious themes, except the religious ideas put forward in this film are so confused, that I'm not even sure what the writer's beliefs actually are. Unless you too can manage to find a ridiculously cheap copy of this film, I wouldn't bother."
4,Is Hollywood BLIND!,I am so sick of those Hollywood executives passin AndrewMcCarthy out! The dude has so much talent and he is been ignored. Thismovie amoung others shows a great talent he has. WAKE UP HOLLYOOD
5,Best Product,"Verbatim by far is the best capacity DVD,I found out months ago that DVD-R are less efficient than DVD+R. They work the same anyways and usually this kind is cheaper. Disks are fast with no errors, while burning or reading after. They offers the highest quality medium, which provides the highest level of read/write performance, reliability, and long archival life."
5,Killer live double set/WR for the 90s,"Zawinul and the Syndicate turn in muscular performances from 1997. Covers much of the Syndicate catalogue as well as cuts from ""My People"" and ""Stories of the Danube"". OG style Fusion, World Beat and BeBop; World Tour has it all, and it smokes! Weather Report for the 90s! I have seen them several times and this CD really captures what the shows are like: high energy, furious improv exchange, thundering grooves that can modulate to sensitive introspective explorations and then turn back again on a dime, played by the some of the best musicians in the world. Features Drummer Paco Sery, Percusionist Manolo Badrena, Guitarist Gary Poulson, Bassists Victor Bailey and Richard Bono (Manolo Badrena played on ""Heavy Weather"" and Victor Bailey replaced Jaco). Shame no earlier work with Gerald Veasley or Matthew Garrison included. If you enjoy the Zawinul Syndicate studio releases or Weather Report, then this CD is a must buy."
3,It's true,"This book is very true. All the stuff talked shorthand stated in it is very true. However, annoying. This is every day life. Actually sounds like a grumpy old sour man going off about stuff you see everyday and most of it, theirs nothing anyone can say or do that would change it. I understand where he is coming from."
3,Funny,"I thought the book was funny, and enjoyable to read (plus very short), but it was just ok for me. If you have a couple of hours and looking for some humor we can all relate to, I'd recommend it."
3,Missing the Underdark,"This book is very similar to the previous Exile. It consists of a series of vignettes of Drizzt travelling and fighting of course. However this book takes place on the surface and without the very interesting setting of the Underdark and the complex Drow culture it is nowhere near as interesting.Drizzt has made it to the surface and he tries to find a home amongst the surface dwellers. At this point in his life he is seemingly far too naive in his attempts at interacting with the other races of the Forgotten Realms. For a villain we have essentially a redneck bounty hunter who continues to pursue Drizzt to receive more punishment in each meeting.The action is still good, but the lack of the Underdark as a setting, the lack of the Drow culture and a buffoonish villain rather than the future Artemis Entreri or Drizzt's own kin make this inferior to the previous two novels in the trilogy."
3,Not a very shocking conclusion,"This one ends up exactly the way you'd imagine, but i won't ruin it for any potential readers.This is a must read tie in, i'll give it that. You learn how Drizzt became a ranger, what became of his piwafwi, and how he met up with some important characters from Icewind Dale and so forth. So, don't expect any harsh stuff like the confrontations with Zaknafein, or the evil family undertones, cause they're not there. But do it read it if you're two books into the series, just dont expect Homeland quality stuff."
3,Above average.,"Book II of this trilogy was amazing, so its a hard act to follow.Also, technically speaking Book IV was written before this (just like the star wars trilogy) so the author was somewhat ""boxed in.""In the end, this book serves as a ""transitional piece"" which in places feels forced and contrived.I recommend buying it anyway, and sticking with it, as the following trilogy is amazing."
4,A good ending to the Dark Elf set,"Once again RAS does it agin with another solid Drizzt story. It was not as good as the the first two in this set , but I still enjoyed it very much. I liked the book soo much I went out and bought the next 7 books RAS published on the Dark Elf. This book is not a waste of your time or money, but you need to read the first two of this set to really get a feel of what Drizzt is all about. Although theres not as much darkand evil magic in this one compared to the first two it is still full of adventurePROS:Solid plotGood fight scences with a lot of actionWell fleshed out charactersGood endingWell pacedCONS;a few typos ( not a big issue)"
5,Unbelievable!,"R.A. Salvatore has touched my life, along with many others', with his books about Drizzt Do'Urden. The Dark Elf Trilogy is the most powerful literature I have ever read. R.A. Salvatore does not write about killing monsters. He writes about principles, self-knowledge, and prejudice. The journal entries of Drizzt Do'Urden which first appear in Homeland are so eloquent and deep that they leave the reader pondering them for quite some time. I take away something new from these books each time I read them, and I have read each of them many times. I cannot say enough about the writing of R.A. Salvatore. Read it!"
5,Best Fantasy Character I've ever read,"When I first read Homeland, I immediately fell in love with the dark elf character Drizzt. In some ways he is like me, so I felt really connected to him. Homeland and Exile are my two favorite books in the series so far, because Drizzt is in the Underdark and I love this creative world R. A. Salvatore created. These books have a lot of excitement and action, magic and swordfight, the perfect recipe for a fantasy trilogy. This is a must read for anyone who is a fan of this genre!!!"
5,Soujourn is an unforgettable read,"This book really puts Drizzt's struggles on the surface of Toril to life. It is the story of how Drizzt becomes a ranger, it introduces his legendary ranger mentor Montolio, and finally it sheds light on how a Drow Elf is looked upon to the rest of the world. Drizzt Do' Urden is possibly the greatest character in fantasy literature and this book was an outstanding read."
5,Inspiring,"I've been a fan of R.A. Salvatore's work for a long time now. I started with The Crimson Shard and I can tell you that the character Drizzt has evolved considerably with each novel. I was always inspired after reading about Drizzt's adventures. To me, THAT'S what reading is all about. Kudos to R.A. Salvatore."
5,Fantasy's All Time Best,"A friend recommended this series and once I started reading I was totally unable to put it down. This is the most engrossing fantasy series out there. Drizzt is a character most people can highly identify with; someone completely surrounded by evil yet still trying to overcome his heritage. If you haven't read this series start with Homeland and you'll be hooked. I have 9 Drizzt novels and for sure I'll get the rest. I also recommend the game Baldur's Gate for any fan of Salvatore's, Drizzt is a character in the game."
3,The weakest of the trilogy,"Well, I enjoyed the fast paced action of the first two books and the wonderful, dark world of ""the Underdark"" and Menzobarrenzen. Unfortunately, I do not think Salvatore did as good a job with the surface world. It seemed that Drizz't is now such a fantastic warrior that none of his opponents in the story caused him to break much of a sweat, as opposed to Zaknefein in ""Exile"" and ""Homeland"". On the plus side, I think the blind ranger Mooshie was a terrific character and I enjoyed Drizz't's trial and error method of learning about the surface world. Again, basically straightforward stuff, fast paced, without a lot of surprises."
4,Great except for one thing,"This was an awesome experiance to read, and it would be a solid 5 stars, save for one oversight. When Drizzt recounts how he came to be Guenhwyvar's master the story was told in contrast to how it played out in Homeland. Beside that though it was a great book"
4,AN interesting Outlook.,"Although I have not read Exile or Sojourn I have read Homeland, and thought that it was one of the strangest books that I have ever read. Salvatores gripping battle narration kept me reading for hours and made me want to follow the life of Drizzt Do'urden in more detail, this is a great book and well worth a read."
4,"Awesome, but had a few flaws","Sojourn finished strong in conclusion to the Dark Elf Trilogy, however, there are a few things that annoyed me. First off, what's the deal with all these handicapped people he comes across? A disarmed gnome, a transformed hook horror, and now a blind man? Secondly, what happened to the incredible hunter I knew in the last book. Drizzt can't even take on a few orcs, but the blind man can!? Last of all, the obsessed mountain man should have died. He's unbelievably annoying, and where's the justice here? But don't get me wrong, it was wholly enjoyable."
5,Drizzt Do'urden...The classiest character in the realms.,This character is one of the most well rounded characters in literature. His compassion and gentleness are equaled only by his skill in the art of swordplay. Drizzt also opens our eyes to the problems in today's society such as racism and discrimination and shows us that people of any colour can be true friends. There will be no other character who will match the class of Drizzt Do'Urden. Thank you R.A. Salvatore!!
5,one of the greatest trilogies ever!,In this book the main character is called Drizzt Du'orden and it tells the story of his life and how he becomes to despise his heratidge as a dark elf and strives to loose his sence of hatred of their evil ways. This is a superbly told story that sets images in ones mind.
5,Awesome!,"The series continues to grow and get better. The physical, mental and psychological growth of Drizzt is really something to behold."
4,Salvatore continues to impress!,"Drizzt Do'Urden must be one of the most vivid and well fleshed out characters in all of fantasy. There are many depths to the character...he's a warrior, a philosopher, and a humanitarian. It's Salvatore's characterization that makes his books so compelling. If you haven't read any of them, you're missing out."
5,The best books I have ever read!,"This book is wonderful! He describes things with such detail that it seems like a movie in your mind. You don't feel like you are reading a story, it seems like you are seeing the story unfold before you. The story is deep and intelligent, but easy to understand. The characters are amazingly well designed. I love these books and recommend them to everyone! My compliments to the author."
2,Weak compared to the other books in this series,"I would say that this is the worst installment in Salvatore's series so far. Why?The style is too choppy. Scenes that would deserve much more attention - the impact of Kellindil's death, the death of Tephanis - are glossed over and very rushed while other scenes, like the completely nonsensical adventure in the dragon's lair, drag on and on and on.My second complain would be that the book is too preachy. It tries to tell the reader what's right and what's wrong but it's too heavy-handed and definitely not subtle.And the way Bruenor met Drizzt? Well, lets just say that if I read this book before the 2nd trilogy, I wouldn't like the dwarf much."
4,"""thaz wut i'm talkin bout""",another classic cd a must have for all you rhymesayers Hip-Hop heads i got to give my respects to brother Ali cuz his style is original ass f?ck and he's D.T.E.(down to earth) when it comes to his vocabulary.
2,"""Little Caesar - Influence"" try the self titled release first",2 out of 5 stars. I thought I would give this one a try because I liked the first one. This is okay but the first one is better in my opinion. Fans of Junkyard or the The Four Horsemen might like this but I would recommend those over this.
1,Save your money,I am always looking for different ways to workout at home since I don't have a gym that is close by to where I live. I bought this based on the reviews and figured I would try it out since it also looked fun. I do have carpet so I figured it would be easy to use but it wasn't as easy to use. After doing the knee exercises they hurt. I put this away and havent used it since. I would definately try something else.
4,Good Yarn,"Well written saga, a bit long and over elaborate. I knew nothing much about the Loyalists in the Civil War and what happened. As a docu-novel it was good. Kiind of reminded me of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell which was of course a different war."
2,Oliver Wiswell,"This book was perhaps one of the most boring I've ever read. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it's a great source of accurate information regarding both sides of the revolutionary war that you would not get from reading a textbook. However, the novel reads like a textbook, following a predictable series of historic facts. The love story in this book is hardly enough to keep someone interested. The side stories are bothersome and unnecessary. This book could have been compressed from the lengthy 783 pages, into a much more managable 300 pages. The wasted adjectives, similes, and series's make me wonder if Roberts had been paid by the word. I wouldn't read this book unless you were required to."
5,Sweet for pooh fans!,Got this for my sister and it is absolutely charming. I like how the band on the watch is of bees and the watch itself seems very durable.
2,Dissappointed...,"I have been a fan for many years. I have read all her previous books many times over and each time enjoyed them immensly!""Shanna"" has by far been my favourite-but there have been many, many others that were on the same level-ALL in fact-except "" Petals"" . After having waited so long for it to be published-I felt really let down. I kept waiting for something to happen-the spark, intensity of the characters, a good story line -simply wasn't there. -What happened? -It seems to have been writen by someone else? ...."
3,OK but not one of her best,"I have read this book and found it a little hard to swallow. It was okay but KEW has written much better, Flame & the Flower, Shanna etc. Shermaine is accused of murder gets shipped away and she calmly accepts this. She is bought by a man and doesn't seem to mind, she doesn't even try to fight for her freedom. Gage is a little boring nothing like any of the other male characters in KEW books. He buys this woman who is accused of murder and lets her take care of his son, not a very responsible parent."
2,This book was a real disappointment.,"Ms. Woodiwiss is a talented author who has the ability to write thoroughly entertaining, romantic books. When a friend gave me A Rose In Winter several years ago, I liked the book so much that I went on to read several other Kathleen Woodiwiss novels. What I'm wondering after reading Petals On The River is, WHAT HAPPENED? This book was very disappointing. It contained too much whining and too little romance. Also, it was very tedious to hear Shemaine continually referred to as a bond slave, and there was way too much baby talk. The story was predictable and trite, and lacking in humor and suspense. It was difficult to finish the book, but I kept hoping that the story would improve. Unfortunately, even the ending wasn't a surprise. Altogether, this book was a big disappointment. I hope Ms. Woodiwiss's next offering has more going for it."
3,Good story; just incomplete for K.E.W.,"I have read and re-read every one of K. Woodiwiss's novels. My favorites are Ashes in the Wind and A Rose in Winter. Petals on the River could have been almost as good as the rest of the books if the story had started with Shemaine and Maurice's engagement, then her abduction, imprisonment, then deportation to the American Colonies where she meets her true love, Gage. K.E.W.'s old writing style was a more complete long story about the hero and heroine's trials and tribulations, and that was definitely lacking here. Also, Shemaine's lack of an immediate apology to Maurice was rather cruel. He is treated almost as a villian instead of the man who was her former betrothed. K.E.W. needs to read her older books and return to that style of writing!"
3,Be careful what you wish for,"A charming story about a widower who needs a nanny and a falsely accused convict fresh off the criminal boat who needs a purpose in life. The two come together as society requires, and the story line follows the development of their mutual love and respect, despite outside influences."
3,The story was good.,"The author seems obsessed with the word ""orb"". The character's eyes are referred to as orbs and the breasts are referred to as orbs!"
4,Loved it...sweetly romantic. (of course!),"If you're looking for a charming story with a hopelessly romantic happy ending: look no further. Gage, the bold and rather heartbroken hero, is almost perfect. And Shemaine...what can one say? You will cheer her on from your first meeting. She has class, spunk, kindness, and (as usual) outstanding beauty. While a rather small amount of dialouge is fairly unbelievable, and the plot is every ONCE in a while predictable (i.e. you don't have to think to read this book, hence the 8 not 10 ) this is a darling tale of love conquering all. And...if you read this book for no other purpose: the Beauchamps are back in it! The mystery of Garland's husband is solved...and you meet a pre-Shanna Raurk!"
1,"Bad, but don't give up on this author....","I don't understand how KW can write such classic material in most of her previous novels, then ruin the book by droning on and on with boring dialoge and settings. By that point, who cares about these otherwise memorable characters? This book, however didn't even get that far. It was totally boring, lifeless, if you will, which aggravated me as I'd waited a long time to read it."
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,"I wish I could give this book 0 stars. This is the first Woodiwiss book that I absolutely could not finish. Neither could my mother, or a good friend of mine; both of whom are also big Woodiwiss fans.I can hardly believe this is by the same author who wrote The Wolf and the Dove, Shanna, etc. I am not a romance novel fan, but I have always enjoyed Kathleen Woodiwiss' books.This book was so boring and the characters so flat that I didn't even care what happened to them. I highly recommend that you skip this book, unless you just absolutely have to read everything this author writes."
2,"Unfortunately, this one's a don't not a do!!!","I must say that I have been reading Woodiwiss books for over twelve years. I started with ""A Rose in Winter"" and this is not even in it's league. I am and always will be an avid fan of her books. I always look forward to her newest novel, though this one nearly put me to sleep at several points. It took three tries just to sit down and read the book. I had trouble getting past the first couple of chapters. I was expecting much more from this work than what I received. It was a pleasant story, though altogether too drab. The characters were pretty dull, not alot of life to them at all. Shemaine was too meek for her own good and far too afraid of her own shadow. I give this book an overall score of two stars because instead of a book which I couldn't put down, I received a book which I was loath to pick up!"
2,"""Are you sure Kathleen Woodiwiss wrote this book?""","I found this book unusual for Kathleen. I have read all of her books at least twice...except this one. I could not even finish it. I know I am hard to please. I think ""Ashes in the Wind"" and "" The Flame and the Flower"" and ""So Worthy My Love"" are some of the best ever written!"
1,Disappointing,"I have read all of Kathleen's books. This one just lacked any character depth. I kept waiting for some drama, but it never developed."
1,Would have been a good book except for one thing.,"The sex scenes. Honestly, has anyone ever experienced sex like this? Kathleen Woodwiss's graphic descriptions were nauseating, not because they were perverted, but because they were simply too unrealistic. In this book, the heroine is beautiful beyond belief, and our hero, Gage, is handsome beyond wildest imaginations. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, there's a threat to their love, they overcome it ho hum.......Sorry, but the author needs to GET REAL."
3,"Good story in the end, but really slow.","This book was good in the end; however, it took me a couple of months to read and I typically read a book in a couple of days!"
4,A very enjoyable feel good book,"I enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down until I finished it. Left you with a warm feeling."
4,ANOTHER WINNER FOR WOODIWISS,"I STARTED READING KATHLEEN WOODIWISS IN 1980. MY SISTER AND I HAVEBEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE. THE STYLE OF WRITING, THE CHARACTERS, AND THE STORY LINES HOLD THE READER AND KEEPS ONE WANTING MORE. SHERMAINE IS A TRUE HEROINE; GAGE IS EVER THE DASHING LEADING MAN. I TRULY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANOTHER 20 YRS OF KATHLEEN. I JUST PICKED UP THE ELUSIVE FLAME AND CANNOT WAIT TO GET STARTED. CARRY ON KATHLEEN, YOUR #1 (HA) FAN"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I HATE TO SAY IT BUT THE ONLY THING INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS THE COVER AND MAYBE THE FIRST CHAPTERS. IT STARTED OUT GOOD, BUT AFTER THAT I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO CONTINUE. ALL JOKES ASIDE IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH. IT WAS TO MUSHY, BORING, PREDICTABLE, AND WAY TO MUCH BABY TALK. THIS WAS MY FIRST WOODIWISS NOVEL AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE MY LAST. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 1 STAR IS BECAUSE ZERO WASN'T AN OPTION."
1,"where is the sexual tension, odvious love, and humor","""the Wolf and The Dove,"" ""The Flame and the Flower,"" and then ""Shanna"" after that all the books seemed to go DOWN HILL from there. I remember staying up all night to read The Wolf and the same way with The Flame. As a matter of fact anytime I'm feeling down I reread these books. I have reread those two books at least once every year since written. DO YOU THINK MS. WOODIWISS READS OUR THOUGHTS? Please, I would like more stories like your first ones. I always enjoyed the way your words flowed almost like poetry. You could feel the love between the chacters and the sexual tension would build. I enjoy escaping to a fairy tale land where romance and Gentlemen still exist. PLEASE GIVE US MORE LIKE YOUR FIRST NOVELS. Thank you"
5,Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is back with a winner!,"Twenty-five years ago I was given The Flame and The Flower by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss...and I fell in love !!Such descriptive writing..you could almost be there. Each successive book was eagerly awaited, and Ms. Woodiwiss became my scale upon which all other authors were compared.Her new book, Petals on the River, has renewed my faith in this authors writing. She is back, and back on track with the style, the characters and the story line that all her true admirers will relate to. Shemaine and Gage are delicious characters, both caught in a situation that leads to interesting conclusions. Throughout the story there are elements of suspense, romance and humor. There is also a very enjoyable and surprising ""visit"" from characters from one of Ms.Woodiwiss' previous books. Do yourself a favor..READ THIS BOOK..it's terrific!"
1,Can I give less than 1 star?,"I used to be a fairly loyal KW fan, but I won't take the chance that she'll write another book this bad. I couldn't finish this. The plot was unbelievably predictable and the heroine was so unbelievable perfect that I found her unbelievably boring."
1,Disappointing!,"It was hard to believe that this was a Woodiwiss book. I made it only half way through and gave up. I had just re-read ""Shanna"", her very best book ever, and was expecting more from this author. Actually, the reason I did buy this book was because of one of the reviewers mentioning she re-introduced Ruark Beauchamp. The characters (not the Beauchamps) are uninteresting wimps, totalling boring! Save your money. I did not like this book at all. Not what you would expect from Kathleen Woodiwiss."
1,a very dull read,"I love romance. This was not it. I thought that the story line was slow, and predictable. It was all I could do to finish it. This is the first book I've read by her, and doubt I will read another."
2,OK but nothing to swoon over,"Ms. Woodiwiss seems to write books that are either exceedingly brilliant or exceedingly mediocre. I would have to put Petals on the River in the second catagory. It is fine for something to read because you have nothing better to do, but for good entertainment it would be best to try another of Ms. Woodiwiss's books (The Flame and Flower being a prime example.)"
1,This can't be something from Kathleen Woodiwiss!,"I didn't even finish the book. I left it midway and even then it was a struggle to reach there! Her recent books deviate from her usual execellent ones and this one was the very worst, never something that I would expect from her. Perhaps her recent divorce (I think I heard something along this line somewhere) is to be blamed..."
2,Could be much much better,"I've read every novel of Ms Woodiwiss; I have been waiting for years for her new ones and kept looking around for her books whenever I was in a bookshop. And finally, here comes the new novel. But ...I have to agree with the reveiws before me that this one is the least good (I don't want to describe it as the worst) of her works : the story is predictable; nevermind if the story is predictable, but the characters are boring and one-dimensional; I thought there might be more enlightening scenes involving Andrew, the son, but he just played a minor role; the whole plot is just too easy for the characters and not much development. I've to put it down and go to sleep in between the story ('cos I didn't want to fall asleep while reading it : Woodiwiss is my favorite author and I hate doing this to her).Just keep hoping better novels that at least compares to her usual standard would come soon."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I have been a life long fan of Kathleen, I started loving romance novels because of her writing. I fell in love with Shanna and The Flame and the Flower. But this particular book just didn't do it for me. I hate to say it--but it just did'nt have the magic touch, and I admit that I rushed to read the ending because I was bored!!!! Sorry"
2,Disappointed -- Could have waited longer for her next book,"I am a big fan of Ms. Woodiwiss, however, this book was very disappointing. I have read all her books and eager await her novels. This novel lacks any kind of suspense and is very perdictable from the moment you pick it up."
2,Agreed: What was the wait for?,"I follow several authors of romance novels, and it's been a long wait since the last Woodiwiss novel. I think I would have rather kept waiting than settle for this book, which was very predictable with very little tension or suspense (romantic, sexual, or otherwise). I was originally pleased to see that the book came out as a more affordable trade paperback (rather than a hardcover) but $10 is too much to spend. I'd rather re-read The Flame and the Flower. In short, I was very disappointed in this novel. Frankly, when I finally reached the end, I found I didn't even care what happened to the characters."
2,Boring!,"I have always been a huge fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss and was looking forward to reading her latest, what a disappointment! I loved all of her other books, but this one just didn't do it for me."
2,Very disappointing,I am a long time fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss. I think her best novel was Ashes in the Wind. I was waiting for her new novel to be published and I must say it is very disappointing. I still haven't finished the last 50 pages. I don't understand how such a gifted writer could have missed the mark. The characters were one dimensional and the story was very lame and predictable. There were no surprises or anticipation for the love scenes. I hope this was a fluke and that Ms. Woodiwiss provides her loyal readers with a better story and more well developed characters in her next book. Or she may lose a lot of fans like Patricia Cornwell.
2,I waited five years for this?,after waiting 5 yrs for this I've fallen asleep 6 times while reading it.I've either out grown Woodiwiss or perhaps she should put her pen to bed with her heriones.
5,Excellent reading!,"I'm giving this book a 5, though I don't have a lot of ""romance novel"" experience to compare with. I bought my 1st romance novel on the recommendation of a friend. I had a preconceived notion of what they were like. Since then I've read 3 and I love them! What I like about this author is the romance, the courting, and the way she describes the seduction. It's not real smutty (like I expected)! I think I'm hooked on them now. I hope this might convince any other 'beginners' to give this author a try. I'm hesitant to add, but it's improved my own sex life - since romance is on my mind so often lately ;-)"
1,Boring,"I have been listening to this book on cassette tape, and the only redeeming quality I could find about it is the narrator. How she managed to breathe life in Shermaine and Gage, I'll never know. But, alas, even the narrator's wonderful way of reading just couldn't get past the words! I found it to be boring and predictable. That is the last Kathleen Woodiwiss book I'll ever buy! Too bad...I loved her previous books."
2,Definitely not one of her best...,"I first read THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER in 1971. I was riveted from page one. THE WOLFE AND THE DOVE and SHANNA were also terrific and I've read them countless times. It seems she's gone downhill from there. The one about the Russian princess I didn't even finish. PETALS ON THE WIND has a lot of the same character types as FLAME but was not near as captivating. I kept thinking Roxanne was Louisa. The book is predictable, no real tension even though the main characters lived in the same house and don't make love until 3/4 through the book. She should also try to make her female characters a little more 3-dimensional and realistic. All her heroines lately are petite and the most gorgeous thing walking the face of the earth. No one should be THAT perfect even in literature. She used to be my favorite author, but not any more. Maybe I've outgrown her. (sigh!) I hope THE ELUSIVE FLAME with a grown up Beau will recapture her former glory!"
4,READ THIS ONE!,This is the first romance novel I have ever read and I thought it was great! I felt like I was right there in the book. I could very well relate to Shemaine. I really like the setting of the book because I live in the area that it took place in. I have been to the places that are mentioned in the book!
2,Kinda lame,"This is my first book by K.W. and it may be the last. There were some nice parts, but most times you felt like it was dragging on and on. And why the heck was everybody and their dog trying to kill Shemaine all the time? It became ridiculous after a while. The author could have easily shaved off 75 pages of worthless information."
2,"Read as if it was right from a romance writing handbook,","instead of the gifted author. I was very disappointed in this latest book compared to earlier ones written. Everything was a little too perfect for the heroine Shemaine. She was just too perfect as a character. (I guess she wouldn't know what a bad hair day was...) The most believable scenes were ones that involved Gage's young son Andrew. Since she dedicated this book to her young grandson Seth then we at least understand why Andrew's words and behavior were realistic although predictable. The book left a bad taste in my mouth, everything fell together too neatly, as though it was wrapped up like a nice clean package. There was absolutely no suspense or guessing or tantalizing chemistry and sex scenes between the characters. I had a hard time visualizing the characters and if that happens it is a sign that the book isn't worth the read. A huge disappointment when compared to what I feel to be her best book ""A Rose in Winter""."
4,Loved It,"This was the second of Katleen Woodiwiss book that I found and read. I really loved this one as well. It was sort of bittersweet because *spoiler alert* her fiance that she was torn away from sailed all over to find her and when he did she was married with a baby on the way but I still loved it because she was in love with the man that essentially saved her from her fate. But you can't help but feel for the ""other guy"" and wonder what could have been. Great story with lots of action. You will not be disappointed by this one. Trust. This is another one of her books that will have you reading it over and over. :)"
3,great fun (when it works),"We are glad we sent in the warranty info. Last month it shut down cold and dead. We are sending it back. When it worked it was great fun and the kids loved it. the words appear on screen to help them learn the songs! However, they are sad because one day they went to play with it and it was completely dead. Like losing a member of the family. Hope the warranty people dont jack us for additional monies."
4,Taize,"This book provides many songs that can be used in a TAize service. Coupled with another book that contains 20 potential TAize services, it makes it easy for someone to prepare and offer a Taize service."
5,Fitting End to a Great Series!,"Robert Forsyth wraps up the Luftwaffe Colours series with this volume covering the desperate air combats fought in 1944 and '45 over the Reich. As with the other volumes in the series, a comprehensive text is combined with dozens of photos, including rare color shots, and Tom Tullis' marvelous profiles.Forsyth's book makes for compelling reading as Luftwaffe units are steadily ground down by Allied airpower. Ill-served by their leader Goring, the various Jagdgeschwaders kept flying and dying till the last days of the Reich. Despite improved aircraft like the FW 190D and development of new tactics such as the Sturmgruppen assault units, the steady loss of Experten coupled with shrinking fuel reserves doomed German air defense operations.All in all, a very readable summary of the dying days of the Luftwaffe and a treasure trove of photos and artwork. Luftwaffe fans will want this book. Highly recommended!"
4,very good photographic/profile material,"In the same series, I bought ""war in the east"" which I found a bit disappointing in term of original documents. The nature of the conflict in the East may not have helped to gather that many first hand pictures.This volume on the contrary has a wealth of interesting photographies and the corresponding color profiles. It makes this volume of particular interest to the collector and aircraft hunter.Without being over enthusiastic about the book (I am more a mid level ""enthusiast"" looking for plenty of color profile) I find this book a good source to place me in a friendly way at an advanced level in luftwaffe history, and I am grateful for this because it does it totally painlessly."
5,The book on lithium,Very concise and well illustrated. The book to have if you are interested in lithium.
4,A Witty Love Story,"This work offers a suspenseful yet funny look at the dangers involved with relationships and secret keeping. Lindsay has painted a humorous picture of Bob Hule's chaotic and topsy-turvy love life, and the walls and barriers that it presents him and others with. The characters' antics are bound to provoke smiles and chuckles. You will be glad you read this play!"
3,I Know Too Many Bobs,"Bob-a man once described as the devil in disguise by his sweet fiancée Lucy. Playboy Bob finds himself in quite a predicament when the all three women in his life decide to pay him a visit the same day. Confessions spill and the tension builds as the women realize they've been caught in a web of womanizing lies. I was especially entertained by Bob's downward spiral and Lucy's voyeuristic tendencies. This play encompasses a type of adolescent humour that made me giggle like a schoolgirl. However, it sadly reminded me that there are three men in my life just like Bob. I actually feel sorry for them sometimes, but not Bob. He deserves what's coming to him."
5,Crazy characters keep you glued,The Man Who Loved Working Women is a tale of unexpected and intriguing twists which keep the reader glued and wondering just how things will turn out for this cast of crazy characters. The author does an exceptional job of turning up the pace in the second half of this play as the tables turn and the truth comes out in this soap-opera style comedy. It's the type of story you can't put down once you get started.
4,Does the job,"The product does the job.It to extra long to get it - The only suggestion I have is to make the drain hole larger , I had to drill it out to make a live bait well."
3,Can be hard to see hit on the target,The all black background is hard to see the hits when in a poorly lighted indoor range. But a Shoot N C sticker solves this problem.
1,Hoppe's 12x20 target,"The target size is great for all ranges at an indoor range, but the paper is too thin and the shots are almost impossible to see. I had to keep running the target back to me to see where I hit it. I won't buy these again."
1,The Target Pictured Is Not What I Got,"I wanted the type of target as represented in the picture. I did get a 12 by 20 rapid fire target. And, I guess I will use. Pricey for 20 targets. If you are going to show an example of what you are advertising, make sure it is the correct picture."
5,"TOP NOTCH! KNOWS HOW TO DO IT, AND SHARES IT.","The author shares his knowhow in this book. I have dozens of books on nature photography, and this ranks in the top two or three. Buy it, read it,you won't regret it."
1,Orange World,"Joseph K. Lange's extensive use of polarizing and ""enhancing filters"" on his landscapes made this book very difficult for me to look at. Some otherwise wonderful landscapes were turned into pictures I found hard to look at.I can not recommend this book."
2,Not so Hot,"I found the video to be quite general in nature, and the information to be quite old. I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,THE BEST EVER,"THIS IS THE BEST CONCERTO PERFORMANCE IN THE CD CATALOGUE. NOT JUST OF THE TCHAIKOVSKY-THE BEST OF ANY CONCERTO OF ANY TYPE IN THE REPERTOIRE (HENCE THE CAPITALS) PERIOD! ALTHOUGH THIS IS A RECORDING, AND NOT OF A LIVE PERFORMANCE, TO ME IT BEATS ANYTHING LIVE OR STUDIO RECORDED HANDS DOWN. I defy anyone to listen to any other performance of any concerto and refute this! Please because I'll probably have to buy it to compare if it's that good. The other three concerti are also excellent, for what it's worth. The idea that this CD is not in print, is just another testament to the idiocy of the recording industry (Naxos please forgive me). No wonder EMI is bankrupt!"
3,Needs to be Revised -- Still A Lot of Good Info,"This book gives a comprehsensive overview to Web advertising. Very well researched and the author seems to have excellent experiences. However, this is almost Y2000. A major revision is needed."
3,"Lots of detail, maybe too much detail?","This book has plenty of useful information for the professional web marketing person. Most of the info is for people that actually have a marketing budget to work with(ie there's lots of info about banner advertising, very little about the cheap/free marketing methods (ie search engines, link exchanges, etc.))I found this book tough going at times. If you don't have much to spend on marketing your web site then there are better books that would suit you, but if you're really serious then this would be a good book."
5,The closest thing,"This is a marvelous CD, especially the Pearl Fisher's duet with Gedda and Blanc. I would rank that performance second all time, just below theforever unforgettable Bjoerling/Merrill version. Worth the price just for that selection, and all the rest is top rate as well."
1,What a Disappointment....BEWARE!,"I did not read that this was just ""The Most Famous Opera Duets"" of GEORGE BIZET! Here I thought I was getting Puccini, Verde, Mozart! I love Bizet's Carmen, but would have enjoyed the others much more."
2,Misleading Product Details,"I bought this CD being fond of the baritone Eberhard Waechter - who is the only performer listed in the specs. Well, guess what? He only sings on one of the 14 tracks. Another example of the sloppiness that reigns among Amazon's product descriptions. Often enough, this is not Amazon's fault, but that of irresponsible or plain stupid third party sellers with pro merchant status (the latter entitling them to add any kind of nonsense to the Amazon database without editorial or quality control intervention). So, the 2 stars do not reflect performance quality, but false advertising."
3,Only one song knew well,I should have done more research. The last song is the only one I could easily recognize. Live and learn.
2,I guess I'm not an opera buff,"I *want* to like opera, so I tried this CD as a starting point. Played on a fairly low-end automobile sound system. Suffered through the first few cuts, and hit eject - too much screeching and bellowing. I think the CD itself is well-manufactured, the price was right, and shipping was quick ... but it's just not right for my taste and/or level of sophistication."
4,Fantastic value for the money for opera beginners.,"very beautiful opera duets at a price that cannot be beat. first three tracks set the tone, very stirring music. silly looking cover."
3,Great Value!,"I actually bought this CD for one track (one of the duets from The Marriage of Figaro), but I was impressed by the other offerings. Opera fans will probably enjoy this disc."
4,Did exactly what we wanted it to,"We decided to learn more about opera in general, so we bought a bunch of CDs in our attempt to educate ourselves in more depth. This CD helped in that goal. What more can we ask?"
4,I wouldn't Mess with Chopper!,"Mark ""Chopper"" Read, Austrailia's most Notorious Criminal Character! You want True Crime? With a Twist? Pick up this, his Best selling memoir. His life, exploits, opinions, and a cultural history of the, in america almost unknown, world of the Austrailan Underworld. I Cringed, Sweated, Laughed and felt I was there throughout, from Chopper's very Personal & very Unique writing style. See the Film, it's Excellent! But read the story too! But don't stop there head on to Chopper 2!"
3,Poor recording,"I have no doubt that the conductor, chorus and soloists knew what they were doing, it is overall a very professional recording. I do have several problems with it. When i state my problems, i am comparing it to Bryn Terfel's representation that just snaps with conviction and is completely lacking the sterile quality I thought this recording shows. Part of the problem is that this was recorded in 1968, and recordings ahave come a long way since then. The other thing is that the soloists do not sing as though they really believed what they are singing. It sounds like just another passage to sing. The otehr thing is that they replace the quartet in ""Cast thy burden upon the Lord"" with the mushily recorded chorus-a real negative. So, if you don't mind an unclear recording, and a professionally sterile performance, this is the one to buy!"
3,Elijah critique,"This is an fair recording. The solo parts are clear and easy to follow. On the other hand, the choral passages leave much to be desired. they are over stated and distorted. One would need a score of the music in order to follow the singing and understand the words being sung."
4,AWESOME!,"It may be just me, but there is something intriguing about seeing a bowler hat that has survived nearly 100years on the ocean floor, or a cup standing upright on a dresser liked it had just been put there after plunging 2.5km to the ocean floor.Ghosts of the Abyss will blow your mind with exactly how beautiful the inside of the Titanic still remains. Incredible pictures of inside staterooms, the reception room, wireless room, landing vestibules, the Dining Room, Cpt Smith's bathroom and other rooms deep withing the wreck of the broken ship.Some sheer horror will also be met with pictures of the boat deck collapsing slowly into A deck; a testament to the power of age.The only downside to the book is there is not enough photos of inside the wreck - you really just want MORE."
5,"Beautiful book, wish they'd put the movie out on video","While not a very big book at just 143 pages this is one of the nicer Titanic books I've seen. Dedicated to both those who died during the sinking and those who died September 11, 2001 (while the film project was underway)the fist chapter gives a quick but detailed history of the Titanic folowed by several chapters devoted to the crew's exploration and filming of the shipwreck and it's aftermath.I really liked the photos of the wreck as it is now, especially when compared with similar period photos, and the computer graphic reconstructions were amazing. Many of the photographs seemed very familiar, I was surprised to see so many of things that had somehow survive breaking and kind o depressed to see the signs of collapse that the wreck is now going through.I sure wish I could've seen the movie, hope it comes out on video soon and I'd like to see much more work of this type doen before it's too late."
2,Star Wars Figures,"There's a reason that you cannot find the size in the description. It is 2 to 3 inches tall, and very disappointing."
1,Item too small,"I would not reccomend buying this product because it was advertised as a youth replica (14-16). My son just turned 15, and while he is somewhat tall, the jersey was too small and too tight. When I inquired about free shipping as part of an exchange for a larger and more expensive size, I was told this was not an option. I would not do business with this company again."
1,Completely ignores Pakistani Terrorism,"Looking for historical facts about Kashmir? Look somewhere else.Schofield completely ignores the history of the region that points an accusing finger towards islamic terrorism responsible for forcible conversion of Hindus and Buddhists to Islam.She has not given importance to the fact that Pakistani terrorists tried to infltrate the region in 47 and then again in 65 but were beaten by the Indians.She again ignores the curse of terrorism, Al Qaida and Taliban active in the valley today, all with the help of rogue elements in Pakistani army.This book is certainly a good attempt at writing history of the troubled region but Pakistani terrorism is a part of this history. Thousands of people have been killed by these Pakistani terrorists. Lets not insult the dead by ignoring them."
5,Cant Go Wrong with klein!,"I know klein makes great tools and expected nothing less with these. They are very well built with sturdy and comfortable cushion grip handles. The hollow shafted hex ends fit to fasteners and bolts perfectly. The chrome plating is also very nice and holds up to constant abuse. I am in the hvac/r feild, and use nutdrivers daily! These nutdrivers took the place of my previous craftsman set. Cannot go wrong with klein tools!"
2,"Should have been called, ""Ghosts I've Heard About.""","I was disappointed in this book. Most of it reads more like a travelogue -- ""We went here, and they told us about their ghost; then we drove to Place Number 2, and they told us about their ghost..."" and so on and so on. Only a very few actual encounters with ghosts, more just other people's stories.Holzer refers over and over to himself in the third person, as in ""The Ghost Hunter must return to this site in the future."" It becomes pretentious and obnoxious quickly.It's an easy read, and if you just want to hear (unsubstantiated by mediums) stories about ghosts, it's not bad. But don't spend a lot on it."
3,Gift for my granddaughter,"I would have give this 5 stars, however, this was a gift for my granddaughter and the strap broke only after a couple of months. I think an adult wouldn't be nearly as ""hard"" on it as an 11 year old, and if it did last longer I'd give it 5 stars. It's VERY cute and she loved it! :)"
3,Nice Product,I am still using this case 2 years after buying it. The strap fell off but the body/pouch is in good shape.
4,Good Read,"One of the best books regarding Daniel out there. William Shea knows what he is talking about, and if you want a simply yet good read this is the book for it."
4,an odd little treasure,"what a sweet, eccentric, charming little tale!two old ladies take a young boy to live in a tree after a beloved tincture recipie is stolen from one of the women. they don't stay in the tree long, but while they do- a strange cast of character's pass by, drop by, & stay for awhile.this is the first thing of capote's i've read, although i am well aware of his more famous works. i was truly delighted by this short, sweet, book (the version appearing here says it's 200 odd pages- my copy was under 100), and i recommend it to anyone who searches for profound lovlieness immersed in oddity."
4,An American Classic,"Just finished reading Truman Capote's story collection ""The Grass Harp"". I smiled throughout ""The Grass Harp"" and luxuriated in his adept images and mastery of colloquial dialect and dialogue. Four out of five stars."
5,Simple but spectacular,What a fun concept this technique is for both beginning and experienced quilters. It is basic strip piecing and takes advantage of some of the fabulous batiks and hand-dyed fabrics available today. Most of my quilting friends who've used this book took their basic Convergence pieced quilt top and embellished/appliqued them to the nth degree. It is a contemporary look to say the least.
5,very good,"The book illustrates detailed methods of making the quilt. I have been wanting to make one for some time, and now I look foward to using the book to try this new method."
5,Pure modern rock....amazing album,This is one of my favorite albums of all time ...easily in my top 5. Every song on here is good. This is one of those albums when people ask if you could bring only 5 CD's to a deserted island well this album would be on the list for sure! A timeless gem of modern rock from an amazing band at a great time in music. They don't make music like this anymore(sadly)unfortunelty.
4,Plimsouls - 'Everywhere At Once' (Geffen),"Originally released in 1983, who could honestly forget this fun-to-listen-to new wave, power pop, alternative (call it what you like) band? Guess they disbanded after this record came out. Never one of my favorites but I remember this lp on the turntable at several college parties I hung out at back then. Tunes here I found to my liking were ""Shaky City"", the catchy ""Lie, Beg, Borrow And Steal"", their unforgettable 'signature' song {if you care to call it that} ""A Million Miles Away"", ""My Life Ain't Easy"", ""I'll Get Lucky"" and the surf guitar-like closer ""Hobo"". Nice! Followers of the Romantics, Goo Goo Dolls, The dB's and The Knack should really enjoy this reissue."
3,Rockabilly Gimmick Wears Thin,"If the Plimsouls' Everywhere At Once is supposed to be New Wave, I just can't hear it. These twelve cuts sound like Rockabilly, and lackluster Rockabilly at that. The Stray Cats have done this stuff to death. There's an oh-too-familiar sameness to it all: the fast tempo gets boring. And the pedestrian drumming grates on my nerves. The work of the Plimsouls is interchangeable with that of the Go Go's, only the Go Go's are cuter, but just as banal. No doubt, Peter Case is a talented lyricist and musician, but the never ending Rockabilly gimmick wears thin."
5,Sloan's best album of the 1900s,"Sloan put it all together on this, its third full-length album. It might be a bit too much like the Beatles for some, but it's excellent power pop. The original version was packaged with a bonus disc that simulates a party at which Sloan is providing the entertainment (much like the Beach Boys once did). Cool!"
1,I found this CD for 2.75 NEW! and wish I hadn't...,"I listened to more of that Sloan CD. Jesus, it's dreadful. I've come to the conclusion that people who compare modern bands to the Beatles, need to listen to the Beatles again. Lifting riffs from Beatle tunes does not make a band comparable to the Beatles. And in this case, doesn't even make the tunes catchy. The lyrics are so bad they'll make you turn down the stereo at stop lights and blush. My friend Erik once described some band to me as ""sounding very Canadian"", I didn't know what he meant until I heard Sloan. They are very much Canadian, like their predecessors, Grapes Of Wrath, Corey Hart and Loverboy. Very scrubbed, very tidy and very deliberate in their delivery. About as ground-breaking as a TV jingle. Nice sleeve graphics though!"
4,A good album...,"Well, Sloan is my absolute favorite band. I was not disappointed in this album at all. For the casual listener, it provides a brilliant transition from the early Indy Pop to the current retro style they play. Personal favorite: ""Nothing Left to Make Me Wanna Stay""--The Ultimate Teen Angst Song."
2,Poor quality,The tail rotor fell off right out of the box on the first throttle up. The landing gear fall off if you do not glue them yourself. Not only is it poorly made for the money but it is an extreemly touchy machine. Main rotor to tail mixing have to be perfect. Final thought.... After several hours of hard work adjusting the tail to main rotor mix I managed to get it to stay in the air for a few seconds. If you want an R/C helicopter try the Japanese made Hirobo XRB SR.
4,I love Hubbard's Air Adventures,"I actually listened to the audiobooks and I loved it. These audiobooks are fully dramatized stories with music and sound effect. Like Graphic Audios, except this story and all the other Golden Age Story audiobooks do NOT drawn in the sound effects that Graphic Audios' does.In this audio the sound effects are background sounds. And the story itself is what makes the story a blast to listen to. This story was about test pilot Cal who enters and flies in The National Air Meet competition. He wants to win the contract for Air Mail Transportation. As usual there is a dame in the story (a bit of romance) but this dame is a strong lady! I like strong women! And of course there are villains and danger! Cool thing is that the story is so real, you can tell that the author knew how to fly and has been there."
2,did not work for mosquito prevention,"I read that B1 can build up in your system to prevent bites. I took this faithfully for 4 weeks and saw no improvement. The product itself seemed fine, no complaints about the smell or taste but I am left wondering if a different brand would be more potent and help. I am extra attractive to mosquitoes."
2,Big Disappointment!,Can hear CD spinning which interferes with sound playback. CDs skip with slightest movement of player. Headphones are of inferior sound quality. No AC adapter included.
3,Works Great,I use this on my feet when they get dry and cracked. It makes the shower floor purple but it will come off after a couple weeks. It helps to heal cracks and make your feet feel smooth and soft.
2,Messy,"Customer service is good, as expected, timely, would do business with them again. The product is very messy and stains - would look for an alternative and use this as a last resort."
2,Genetian Vioilet,"It's hard to comment on the effectiveness of the product because I only used it once on my finger nail. It stained my nail so much it looked worse then the infection. I suppose I should give it a chance, but it's hard to walk around with a dark purple nail and explain it to people who ask! If you want to try it just be aware that it really stains!"
5,Great oral thrush treatment,"My infant son had a persistent oral thrush and neither nystatin or diflucan worked t get rid of it. The last resort was the Gentian voilet and it should've been used as the first trratment. Other than the purple mouth, it worked great.WARNINGIt stains pretty badly so make sure it doesn't spill or get on any good fabrics."
4,"Fun, Easy Read","This is a cool book with lots going on. I am always up for a good old spy vs. spy and this book is that at the base, but the author through in a psychopathic killer into the mix. The story is a fun read. The characters are well enough written and the plot construction is believable. Overall the mix of the two types of genre is done very well and it gives you a book that you run through. You do not have to think too hard to read the book which for escapism is good. It is an enjoyable book to pass the time on a summer weekend."
3,Unremarkable but enjoyable,"There's really nothing out of the ordinary about this book, the plot progresses exactly as one would expect with no real surprises, but the story is told in an entertaining way and the characters are quite relatable. If you're a fan of the genre you've probably read stories very like this one before, but you'll probably enjoy this one as well. If you're not familiar with the genre, this would make a reasonable introduction. But if you're looking for something new or unique, this is not it."
5,Best SF story of the year!,"Neurolink is an intriguing vision into the future, when cloning and artificial intelligence will be commonplace. Characters become real as this fast-paced story grabs the reader and takes him on a great adventure. Dominic Jedes is conflicted and stressed and his love-hate relationship with his father rings true. The fiery Major Qi, a real punk chic, is as cunning and strong as she is beautiful. The underwater scenes are vividly described and the action dramatic. Neurolink will establish Buckner as one of our best science fiction writers. This story is an intricate and intriguing weave of science and survival. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story."
2,Pretty design but hard to handle,"These tongs are very hard to grasp and difficult to use. They look good! The quality is good, but it's a struggle."
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"""7 Grandmasters"" is a 70's-style kung-fu classic in every sense of the word. Now released in 1998 (what took so long!), this film is arguably one of if not the best kung fu movie ever made. It combines a solid and classic plot with classic plot twists, ""secret book of strikes,"" animal form vs. animal form galore, grandmaster vs. grandmaster galore, and some of the most intricate intense kung fu action I have ever seen. Jack Long is fantastic. I remember seeing this film in its theatrical release, in Times Square, NYC as part of a triple bill in the late 70's or early 80's. I sat through 2 other films to see the film TWICE, as did everyone else! Put this one in a special place in your collection."
3,Dive Into Adventure,"This book is about a tough guy in a tough situation. It's a great summer read...nothing fancy...just a fun adventure to get involved in. If you like books about the ocean, diving and intrigue, this is one to add to your list. I plan on reading all the Ben Gannon books when I get a chance."
2,Looking for more,"As a writer, I know how hard it is to produce a book, but I couldn't finish this one. Can anyone write about something other than terrorists and drug dealers? How about some pure adventure, no suspense, no intrigue, just a lot of diving, a little fun, maybe some romance (but not essential), and some writing that conveys an author's love of the sea and all that lives in it. Any diver knows there is enough adrenaline in simply going under water, but I guess people who read books and don't dive, they don't have a clue how fascinating and exciting being under water is. They continue to read those pie in the sky Cussler fantasies. Are there any readers who like realism?If I buy another McKinna book, it will be a non-fiction one. I'm tired of fantasies. The real thing is just as exciting, but then I'm spoiled, because I was an oilfield diver too."
3,Good first effort,This is the first novel by John McKinna who was a commercial diver before he began writing.This is a good action novel. I'm a big Cussler fan but I don't think McKinna is quite there yet.If you are interested in what goes on around commercial dive sites {and most divers are} I think you'll enjoy this book.
3,Exciting; the NEXT Ben Gannon could be better,"I enjoyed this ""Techo-thriller"" and read it almost straight through. This was the first ""Off-shore Oil Rig"" thriller that I recall in the hundreds that I have read. It's full of action and great descriptions of off-shore oil rig installations and commercial diving. The main character, Ben Gannon, could have a great future. I recommend it to techo-thriller fans. AND I recommend that the author employ some technical reviewers with experience in areas the author is not before the next book goes to print. Aviation/helicoptors would be a good area to focus on first."
5,Top Rank Sea Thriller with a surprising amount of Heart.,"""Crash Dive"" really caught my imagination. It's a tough little blue-collar story with a number of clever and unexpected twists. Written by a veteran commercial diver, it pulses with true-to-life detail that you don't get from authors who haven't ""been there, done that."" Good job, Mr. McKinna. I'll be looking for your next one."
5,Great music for the like to be traveler,"I bought this because of the wonderful songs heard on the Lonely Planet series. This album is for anyone who enjoys different cultures and colorful music, and when I close my eyes and listen to these songs, I go to Cuba or Africa and all the delicious places one would like to visit."
1,I think it's clear,I think it's clear that this guy wrote his own reviews. Might be worth a chuckle.
1,What a great book!,"I loved this book, and boy did I enjoy it also.Every passage on this tome is a testament to the power of the written word. Ben Tonjak's lyrical style is poetic as well as vivid. His rhythmic method is easy to follow, especially if you are reading this on a train that stops a lot.Some people may object to his use of the word 'the' too much, but I found it remarkably descriptive.The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,A fascinating history,"This is the rare kind of program that makes you feel like a better person for having caught up on a little extra history. The presentation of facts (regardless of what you may see below) is admirable for both its objectivity and educational value. No, the program doesn't intend to bolster your faith, although Christians of all denominations are likely to find something in this series that makes them proud of their individual ethnic heritage. I couldn't stop watching when I was fortunate enough to run across this on television, and I immediately sought it out to buy here. Whether or not you are a Christian, you are likely to find this an interesting presentation that covers a substantial bit of world history."
4,Better than others state,"So, we have one reviewer who admits he hasn't seen the documentary at all, and one who is troubled by its lack of ""faith support."" Admittedly, one cannot cover the whole of Christianity within 400 hrs.; by the same token, you can provide a general framework that fills in gaps of (mis)understanding, clarifies key points, and identifies major figures. You get what you get in terms of a pick-and-choose format because of time constraints. Does that make this a poor documentary? Far from it. If by ""liberal"" we mean ""willing to look at history from differing points of view"" and ""challenging beliefs,"" then yes, the verdict is guilty. However, the scholars and experts in the documentary know their stuff. If you really want liberal, see PBS's Frontline production From Jesus To Christ (another fine production). Don't be scared off by those who might be afraid to have their faith systems explored and scrutinized. Honestly, such scrutiny actually makes our faith much stronger."
3,Viewer Beware,"First of all, 'documentaries' by A&E usually do not carry any guarantee of accuracy. But the real red flags should go up when Elaine Pagels or anyone from the ""Jesus Seminar' offers their opinions. The private agendas of both are never stated but are highly suspect."
4,"DVD ""Christianity- The first two thousand years""",Christianity-The First Two Thousand YearsProduct arrived promptly and in good shape - as advertised.
2,Don't buy it.,"HI.Like my title says, don't buy it.The writer, narrator, and material is terrible.And quickshipvideo does not give a refund once you open the dvd (at least amazon.com gives a partial refund on an openned dvd) (I had to watch it, to realize how bad it was).And their panel of experts are just as looney & shallow.DEFINATE waste of time, does nothing to glorify God, or give a concise historical account of Christianity.Tha narrator poorly reads the writer's absurd message, that Simon (whom Jesus called Rock / Cephas (Greek); Petros (Latin, for Peter) the first pope, but says James was really picked, and James was the first church leader.Don't waste your time and money."
5,Excellent and Intriguing,"This DVD has an excellent musical score, with scenes of beuatiful paintings and landscapes, all while giving the stunning narative history of Christianity."
2,Also think it is biased,The script writers are not very fond of the Catholic Church.Suspected that it would run that way from very early in the series when they stated that James was the leader of the early Church. It did.
5,Worth the price.,"It's interesting to read that several reviewers seem to be a bit upset by this video. I find it extremely interesting and helpful, to the point that I have watched it over and over again.It is intelligently done, especially considering the monumental task of covering two thousand years of history in such a short time. I didn't find it biased at all, and I'm sure that it is as accurate as any other such account could possibly be. I suppose I could understand why it might make fundamentalists a bit nervous.I happen to be a devout Christian. Whenever anyone tells me that something is inaccurate or not what it should be, that's exactly when I take a look for myself, and indeed that has made my faith stronger, as has this video presentation."
4,Great Value!,"Very rewarding to watch. The reviews here are mostly all accurate in my opinion. The soundtrack is very nice and the visuals are interesting, but somewhat hypnotic in that it mostly consists of slow panning across still artwork. The narration could be too soothing and put you to sleep though. I found myself drifting off (not because I was bored, but because slow panning and soft narration against the orchestral backing make for a great sedative.) I reversed the program many times to catch up on what I missed. In this regard, it's hard to get through...but I'm glad I purchased it. It's a great reference tool and wonderfully informative. It's nice to know what all had to take place in the past that made me the Christian that I am today."
2,A typical hit piece skewed against Christianity,"I purchased this video with another produced by History Channel on Inside Islam. This video was very harshly twisted against Christianity, particularly against Catholics, presenting encounters between Christians and non Christians as one way relationships of oppression and inequality.The video does a very good job on many basic facts of rise and growth of Christianity including the role played in Middle Ages and rise of nation states in Europe. Beautiful cinematography as well. Many of the key players in history of Christianity are included as well.But on the whole, this video is useless if one is looking for something for classroom or even to share with grandchildren on history of Christianity. It is just too biased."
4,"really good, not great","I learned a great deal of history through the 400 minutes of video in this series, and I thought I already knew a lot! I liked it overall and I think it's something that everyone should watch. My only complaints were that there are a couple of times that they weren't completely accurate, or mispresented something, such as making it seem like the canonization of the books of the Holy Bible were done hastily at the demand of an Emperor.I also wish that there were more acted out scenes. Through most of the video you're looking at artwork or scenery, and it's not always pictures of what they're talking about, which was weird.Still... my rating is a 4 because I think it was really good, just could've been better."
3,wonder program poor production,"sadly this is wonderful program, but A & E dvd do not work all dvds and there is defects with in the dvd. I have decirded to live with them, but for this price I paid it was not right. A & E/history channel knew that not all dvd players can use their dvds and they do not put waren so people know that is possble not going to work. This is wonderful program and i love it, but dvd was not good. They clear do not care to treat all custmers rightly."
1,"Smudges even if ""waterproof""","I had to return all of the items I ordered since I made the mistake of ordering the ""waterproof"" version. I had tried this before and it smudged down onto my cheeks and onto my eyelids. In no way was it ""waterproof."" I am expecting ABC (the company I ordered this from) to notify Amazon so I can see a credit on my credit card."
1,"Cute, but Cheap.","This purse is super cute. That's where it ends though. I used the bag once, didn't over fill it, just a few evening essentials and came away with pink hands(the dye from the sequins rubbed off on my hands) and seams (where the handles are attached) coming undone. Find a cuter bag some place else!"
2,Designed to break!,"I purchased this bag for our daughter. It was a little pricey for dress-up play, but if it didn't fall apart so easily I'd say it is worth it (she loves it). It was falling apart when it arrived, but I couldn't get a replacement from Amazon so I had it repaired. It has since broken again twice, due to a flaw in its design. The bag is attached to the handle with thread (it is sewn into holes in the metal handle/frame) and when the metal rubs against the thread it cuts it just like a knife. It's a poor design, plain and simple. If you buy it, expect to repair it."
2,Not all that good,"With all due respect to the other reviewers on this site, I have to desagree with their assessment of this book. I found it dragging and very repetitious. How many times did I have to read about what the bad guys did to the heroin? She keeps on coming back to that over and over again as though there was a chance that the reader had forgotten her ordeal. The author repeats herself too much and it almost becomes condescending. I'm not an idiot and I do not hava a short-term memory and I do tend to remember what happened 10 to 50 pages earlier in the book, so I would appreciate not being talked down to in this way.The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the first quarter of the book was alright. However, after the hero found out who the heroin really was, it just went down from there and I was skimming the pages more often than not. Frankly, by the end I didn't care who the bad guys were, I just wanted to be done with the whole thing.Not recommended."
1,Exaggerated Story Line,"This was the first time I've read anything from Gennita Low. Frankly, I thought the entire storyline was ridiculous and far reaching. I know everyone wants to strike out at the government, CIA, FBI or whatever, but this storyline didn't even make me believe that this could happen. I kept hoping it would get better as I read the book but the author kept repeating key events over and over again. Can a person really NOT know who they were for 10 years? The hero was described as being some God in the bedroom who could go for hours and hours and satisfy ANY woman he was with. He's basically a pig who used and abused women shamelessly and then tossed them out after he was through. The heroine only got her memory back once she had some hot sex with her ex-husband??? Oh please!! I didn't care for any of the book .... the storyline, hero, heroine or supporting characters. I will not read any more from this author unless it's outside the scope of this series."
4,Low does not disappoint,"Low's second novel has a less complicated but tighter plot and I thought it much better than Into Danger. The (...) is still beyond steamy but now it is part of the plot and not laminated on because ""that's what you do"". Nikki has lost years out of her life, reconstructed from data but not from the memories she carries with her. Her capture and degrading torture, her rescue and recovery-- these are classic themes of the genre. Also, Nikki's memories of her grandmother's teachings were central to her recovery and really gave a necessary ethnic flavor. Regaining her husband and re-establishing trust - a great read, and would have been without all the bedroom action. And Low leaves the door open for a sequel with ancillary characters. I'll be watching for the next one."
4,Worth buying for about $15,"The first film is corny, either skip over it or just watch without any high expectations. The other three are excellent concept films that actually have themes and deal with real issues as well."
2,Could have been so much better,"What a waste of money and talent! To begin with, Catherine Zeta-Jones should never have been cast as Catherine. She may be pretty and nice to watch in the campy sex-scenes but that's it. She couldn't handle this complex and GREAT character but reduces her to a slutty bitch in corsets. (Pardon my language) Maybe it's the script, the actress or the director but with the leading lady of this movie being so horribly miscast the entire movie goes downhill. The script is campy and not based on the real facts, romping between the sheets seems to be the single focus here. If you want to see Catherine played by a beautiful woman who CAN act, get ""Young Catherine"" with the wonderful Julia Ormond instead."
2,A great disappointment,"If what you're in the market for is a collage of pretty scenes, then this is a movie for you. However, if you have any interest whatsoever in a movie with a decent plot or actors with at least a modicum of ability, your best bet is to pass on this one. This movie is simply ridiculous. What little plot there is virtually incomprehensible, the ""acting"" is an embarrassment to those doing it, and all in all it's a waste of money."
3,CAtherine the Great,For somebody who does not know the historical contents it is hard to understand the story. Acting and Actors are great. I wished it had English subtitles because even for English speaking audience the sound is hard to understand.
1,The Worst,"This was one of the worst I've ever seen. Gross historical inaccuracies, little or none of it shot on location, dialog that would make a soap opera look good. Absolutely horrible. If you're a Zeta-Jones fan, you'll be wondering why on earth she agreed to make this film. The whole thing is disjointed and jumps around so much, it's difficult to follow, even when you know what actually happened, like I do. Skip it!"
2,Catherine of Russia,"Who wouldn't enjoy watching the lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrate her art but the film itself fell flat by my standards--not rich enough in its portrayal of the Czarina's political prowess, her relationship with her predecessor and the horrible Duke she married, or the landscape of that period in history--too bad really."
1,Awful!!! (Zeta-Jones version),This was really awful! They took the life of one of the most interesting people in history & turned it into a poor soap opera.
2,Great acting...but lacking in the edit department.,"The costumes and acting was great...however Catherine's character was made out to be a very sensual character. This isn't a movie for kids under 13 years old, so be forewarned."
1,"Sadly, A&E seems to enjoy making history into soap operas","Don't say I hate history, but many movies turn history into soap opera. The way they had Catherine kissing passionatly and really, history never mentions that. Peter was a jerk, but I never read that he and Catherine kissed passionatly; that was a waste of time. The movies talents were wasted. If they want to make a soap opera, they shouldn't do history but something else. All the actors act like they are from NPR. The only thing I have learned (for I stopped watching it half-way) is that the Ottoman turks attacked Russia. A&E made this movie for the money. If you want to learn the non-romantic story of Catherine, read about her instead of watching this trash."
3,Catherine the Great,Movie is good. Condensed and needed more detail.Shipping and packing of product very good. DVD in good condition.
3,Yet Another Plea Against Editing!,"My main problem with this A&E production was the fact that they cut about half of the original mini-series that this ""presentation"" was taken from. As a result the film as A&E showed it is EXTREMELY choppy (particularly the ending, where you can tell they skipped about an hour of the action). The only redeeming thing about this is that at least they kept a lot of Paul McGann (Potemkin), who is one of the best English actors of his generation. Look for the scene were the Orlov brothers beat Potemkin; the Orlovs are played by Paul's real-life brothers, Mark & Stephen McGann. Great if you are a McGann fan; stay away if you have any real interest in Russian history."
2,Should have been a lot better,"I usually like period pieces, especially A&E ones like Pride and Prejudice and Emma but I really thought that this movie should have been a lot better. This movie is more historically accurate than Young Catherine but the acting in this movie is so wooden and the guys in the movie are not as attractive in Young Catherine. I am giving this movie away and keeping my edition of Young Catherine because it is better acted, better everything....."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"Once again A&E have cut out a lot of the movie. Originally it is supposed to be 180 minutes but they cut it down to 80 minutes which just ruined the movie because it didnt really show the abitious side of Catherine. I do not know why A&E keep doing this. First it happened to Charles: power and passion now this. I advice everyone not to purchase this produce unless you want to waste your money. Rating this movie 1/5 is a compliment, it is not even worthy to give it 1 after all this cut off. IF you are a history buff, wait till the version that is not by A&E. That one is far better and shows the true side of Catherine. I hope this helps future buyers."
3,Pond filters,"This product does a good job of clearing the water in our fish pond. The reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is because the white filters wear out much more quickly than the black filters. The company doesn't sell the white filters separate from the black filters, therefore one ends up having many more black filters but no white filters. A telephone call to the company revealed that they only sell them together. This product would earn 5 stars if we could buy white filters only."
5,"Sarah, Plain and Tall Collection","This is a wonderful story from the first DVD ""Sarah, Plain and Tall"" To ""Winter's End"". It follows the life of a mid-western farm family around the 1900's and pulls you right into the story. My children loved it! And watched it with us again and again!Purchase it and enjoy! It will renew your spirit!"
3,the movies are great!! But,"Unfortunately ours contained three movies, the first, the first, and the last. Therefore we were missing the middle movie. So i still have to go buy the middle movie. Anyone else have this problem?"
4,A Good OLE' Movie,"This was one of my wife's favorites, the price was right and shipped through Amazon...works great, no beat up box.Be BlessedLliam"
5,A BRILLIANT SURPRISE,"I wasn't sure about this, but love this part of the US, so I gambled. It was terrific, the characters and the scenery, one to watch every so often."
5,For the Family,"If you're looking for a timeless classic for your family to enjoy, you can't go wrong with this trilogy. The acting is superb and the stories simple and heartwarming."
4,Sarah Plain and Principled,"If you are looking for a wholesome film that is well acted with a storyline that is original and captivating, this is the film for you and your family. Set in historic America, it admirably portrays the upright pioneering values of God-fearing, hard-working American immigrants. The complex three dimensionality of the characters creates a chemistry rarely seen in good story-telling movies. Don't miss this one, the kids and you will love it."
2,"The Sarah, Plain and Tall Collection","I was delighted I was able to order this collection as the content is not violent and sex oriented that is what prompted me to add this to my video collection. If you are looking for something young children or adults who are sick of violence and sex, order this collection."
5,A Refreshing Series,I don't think watching this series of films will ever get old. I enjoy how well they mirror the books and how each character is so unique. If you are looking for a historical movie collection about family and dealing with the past...this is it.
5,A great trilogy,"The Sarah Plain and Tall trilogy are some of the best movies ever sponsored by Hallmark. The story is compelling, the acting outstanding and it is so interesting to see the children grow up. I watch it over and over."
5,Sarah Plain and Tall collection,I was very pleased to be able to purchase this item through the vendor via Amazon. The price was very reasonable and the DVD came in the condition it was advertised (NEW) in a very timely fashion. I would not hesitate to use this vendor and Amazon in the future.
2,Returned merchandise,This purchase was for a birthday gift. Unfortunatly This person was unable to use VHS. Merchandise was returned and then reordered for DVDs. Still awaiting a refund.
1,Sarah Plain and Tall,I received my dvd Sarah Plain and Tall but was not happy as it would not play on my dvd.
1,"Pretty awful, unlike the book","Sarah Plain and Tall, the book, is beautifully written. It's Hallmark ""Made for TV"" movie adaption does not live up to it's book's glory. I am not impressed with this movie. My little girl, whom I homeschool, watched this movie and said that she hated it because, ""They [the children] didn't look like they did in my head!"" The two others weren't any better. I am extremely dissapointed with the casting. The worst part about it is that it's not told from Caleb and Anna's point of view, which is what makes the book what it is. I have to say this to anyone who's thinking about seeing these movies, DON'T!!"
3,This is not the definite carlo...,"...because there is no such thing as a definite recording of this poorly butchered work. As to the debate raging bellow...i must agree that there are some definite problems here. It starts with the cast. carreras is ideal, freni is barely audible at times. baltsa is absolutely impressive, her, capuccili, carreras and karajan are the reason for this set. karajan brings out a vitality and immediacy that is not found in the guilini set (which is my favorite because of caballe [so lovely! ]). also, the fact that act one is not included keeps this set from being ""the one!"" a strong case can be made for the pappano recording, which is, as someone else said, ""interesting."" If you are like me, you will certainly be inclined to buy just about all the recordings available of this opera. the abbado and the pappano are complementary when dealing with the french version, and this set with either the solti or the guilini would make a good match."
2,let us hear the singers !!!,"A good cast but inaudible because of Karajan's megalomania. The sound, very loud, seems more appropriate for Bruckner or Wagner, than for Verdi. Some orchestral piece or some aria like Elisabetta's ""tu che le vanità"" are interesting in Karajan record, but Verdi is often unrecognizable. I bought the Giulini version (EMI, 1970) then and I discover Don Carlos. I apologize for my bad english."
2,Somewhere in between,"In the debate that is raging below I'm inclinced to side with the London reviewer, whose opinions certainly aren't uneducated: after all, s/he does not say that the singing is bad, just badly served by the conductor, and it is certainly true that they are hard pressed in the heavy moments even though they sing the lyrical bits beautifully. What is more important in deciding whether this should be a first choice is a point that the reviewer from Colorado does not mention, and that is Karajan's decision to omit the first act thereby losing some great music and making the plot almost unintelligible. A recording that does this can hardly be called 'definitive'."
5,Great fun!,"Tom's fictional homage to his wonder horse, Tony, is a great action film. The Amazing Tom Mix, the hero of silent Westerns, rides again!"
3,Interesting Points,"I found this book at a used book store not knowing much about it. I've been studying Shotokan Karate for almost 5 years, and I'm trying to expand my library. This book has some interesting points, especially in the section about mental aspect of karate and some of the exercises. The style seems to be shotokan, although there's no mention of it. Lots of pictures and drawings. I really wonder though, who is A. Pfluger?"
1,i thought i lived in the south...,"I thought I lived in the South, but ""Junebug"" has me wondering. Phillip Morris has taken every stereotype of the South, berated his audience with them, and somehow, received critical praise for this brash misrepresentation of everything i've ever loved about the area i've lived in for 26 years. His characters are one-dimensional and ignorant, apparently like most people from the South. I have yet to find anyone from the South who likes this film, yet many friends, whom i've found to be ignorant of the South, love this film. Morris is from Winston-Salem, where the film is set, but i can't imagine him liking high school or his time spent in the area. The people in this film are cowards who cannot see the world outside themselves, and I resent this narrow view being portrayed so all-encompassing. People love Amy Adams performance. I found her performance the most stereotypical and disconcerting. How good can a film be if the people it's about hate it??"
2,Just Plain Dreary,"This film is grossly over rated. I could not wait to see it and now that I have, I want the time back. Amy Adams is truly delightful and brings the only light to this otherwise dreary and depressing film. Another dysfunctional family piece that ultimately takes us nowhere. I'm not exactly a a happy-go-lucky guy - but compared to these folks, well ... let's just say I would have run off to New York as well."
5,Realistic Reunion,"""Junebug"" is a tender and quirky tale of two lovers who meet in Chicago at an art exhibition, fall in love, and marry. Madelaine (Embeth Davidtz) is the cosmopolitan art dealer; George (Alessandro Nivola) is a passionate Southerner. They head to North Carolina for one of her art deals and for a visit to his family. They are a disfunctional family, including his louse of a brother, Johnny (Ben Mackenzie) and his colorful wife, Ashley (Amy Adams), who is soon expecting. The father is withdrawn, and his mother is hyper-critical of others. There is a clash in cultures, which Madelaine earnestly tries to hurdle without being condescending, yet she discovers her husband as a different person in his own milieu. The contrasts and characterization are phenomenal, and Ashley and George are such lovable people, they make you want to cry. The plot is and is not resolved, but the visit is satisfying enough to give a sense of closure."
3,"A remarkable, realistic, intricate film","There are not too many films that come along that interest or challenge me like this unusual film. I have watched Junebug five times--because of its intricacies--and have picked up new things about it during each viewing. Being that Junebug is an independent film should have something to do with its being so distinctive and not run-of-the-mill. Junebug reminds me of foreign films because of its realism and the showing of the way that things are instead of showing things the way that they should be. In regard to the cast, they all performed well in their roles, but I think that the attractive actresses Amy Adams and Embeth Davidtz were outstanding in their portrayals. Junebug is an intriguing story, and I actually rate it 3.5 stars. It is recommendable."
2,"well acted and directed, just not that much there for a story","i enjoyed the beginning of the movie and felt it was well executed.original and off-beat composition and editing to begin. the actress who played the pregnant sister was also very convincing. unfortunately, i didn't feel the characters were well-developed or defined ultimately and we really didn't gain insight into their emotional machinations. i was left with a shallow feeling of unfulfillment after the movie. the socially and racially challenged starving artist added to the overall gloom and disaffected quality of the film"
4,Masterful parody of southern provincialism,"Angus Maclachlan, the writer of this little masterpiece, must have lived there, because he captures the essense of this Southern family with such accuracy. The acting is superb. We know these people! The background scenery and action lend authenticity, perhaps overdone a bit. One wonders, though, how urbane Madeleine and her provincial husband ever got together (except for the sex which is a bit much), because they are so totally different; and how she ever got interested in the bigoted neighbor's outhouse art. The scene-stealers are Weston, as mother, Amy Adams, as sister-in-law, and McKenzie, as the spoiled, lazy younger brother. This is not a comedy, but a revealing parody, definitely worth a look-see."
3,Not what I expected,"This was a bit too boring for me. I love Amy Adams, but this movie was either too slow for me, or I didn't get it, either way, I was disappointed. Still love Amy though."
5,A Little Gem of a Movie,"This is when I knew Amy Adams was a rising star... She plays a very simple, curious girl with a great big heart. This movie has alot more going for it than you expect...an interesting mix of personalities and people trying to figure out ""life."" Treat yourself to a gem of a film you will think about long after it is over."
4,a flawed but thoroughly likeable film.,"in spite of some obvious flaws in editing and character development (why didn't someone just clobber the obnoxious, self-centered younger brother and get it over with?), and in spite of one of the most overdone southern accents yet (with the folk artist), this film did a remarkable job of capturing the church-going community of the deep south. although it bordered on caricature, it never quite crossed over, and the good qualities more than made up for the flaws."
2,Independent Cliches,"High-class curator gets married to mysterious southern man and visits his home town. She is clueless about Deep South's codes of conduct as if she was an anthropologist discovering a lost tribe in the Amazons. Commonplace shots of American independent cinema are scattered here and there, like arbitrarily sustaining a setting for a lot of precious seconds or making use of off-screen sound only as a trick. Who cares about this? Only a beautiful chatterbox saves the day... (in fact, it looks like a lot of those Southern women are really pretty)."
1,Just Because This Is An Indie Film Doesn't Make It Good,"As a North Carolina resident, I was especially excited to view this film. Unfortunately, I was exceedingly disappointed. Not only was I frustrated with the movie, but also with the overwhelming positive reaction to this poorly constructed film. I attribute this positive response to the ignorance of those who think that because a film is produced outside of Hollywood, it is subject to different criteria. The movie, beyond being a complete waste of my time, contains no sympathetic characters, no real plot, and is only a superficial and vacuous portrait of some superficial and vacuous people. Remember this, fair movie renters, the term ""Indie"" is not equivalent to words like ""quality,"" ""creative,"" or ""worth-watching."""
2,a bug for june now thats whats it sounds like,Dont be intrigue with the stuff in this movie in this black comedy is about a family with a surprisingly bad ending
1,Let Down,"I have never been inspired to write a review of anything in my life, but I have been so confused ever since I've seen this movie. I just don't see the value or the purpose of this movie. Not that all movies should have a purpose, but they should be entertaining at the least. It had so many opportunities to make some poignant statements, or to throw a kink at you, but it just didn't do anything. Nothing was revealed; it didn't even want to make me wonder. I kept thinking that the editors left all the good footage and storyline on the cutting room floor. I don't get it. Amy Adams was terrific, and it might be worth seeing just to see her act out her character."
4,Amy has a great role and carries the movie.,"The movie is a pretty good one, I've watched more than once.I think Amy is a great actress and have almost all of her movies,"
2,Disasterous finale,"Yes, all the glowing reviews about the complex portrait of family, social values and unspoken doubts are true. The performances are subtle and engaging with glimpses of genius. Sounds good right? All of this is rendered irrelevant by the last line of the film. The time and emotion invested watching Junebug is lost in a matter of seconds. I was left bewildered, even angry at what appears to be a faliure in screenwriting. Perhaps someone else could comment to enlighten me regarding the director's/writer's overall intentions. If indeed the last line of dialouge is meant to challenge the viewer's assumptions about the themes in the film, then my opinion is that it missed the mark and detracts from the power of the the film."
2,I did not like Junebug,"There is no a clear message. It is just a mean guy and a bunch of stupids around him. I would not recommend it. Boring and heavy. And the main character, this woman, her only concern is to look good in camera."
1,you cant get much worse than this,when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked good im a fan of Ben McKenzie(tvs the o.c) and as i was watching it i found my attention wandering and when it was done i realized how horrible this movie really is i believe this its the worst most horrible never should have been made movie in the history of cinema.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Junebug is a diverting enough comedy/family drama, but it's very slight and marred by a character (the wacky art dealer) whose presence always grinds the narrative to a halt; though it's enjoyable enough, Junebug isn't really worth seeking out."
5,Amy Adams' performance alone is worth the price of admission,"She absolutely shone in the role of the naif Ashley.I found Junebug a quietly rich, subtle and thoughtful portrayal of family dynamics. What goes unsaid is more important as what is said. I've seen it a few times now and each time I get something new out of it.It's not for the impatient or easily bored, though. You have to stick with it. But the effect on me was not so much as having seen a great movie but having seen a great piece of theatre. And that is a rare thing."
5,Holy Crap,"I watch a lot of movies and I'm very critical with my standards, but this movie floored me. Amy Adams is an incredible actress; it will be a crime if she does not get the Oscar. Every actor in this movie does a phenomenal job here, (except for Benjamin McKenzie who was WAY out of his league here... he couldn't even get the southern accent right). Pure, authentic human emotion and in all the right ways, never overdone or far-fetched, just a wonderful lens into the way people interact with eachother, the way different kinds of people have different outlooks and different levels of understanding. It's hilarious and poingiant and it taught me a lot about myself... I love it when movies do that. Here's a great line delivered perfectly by Adams...""God loves you just the way you are but he loves you too much to let you stay that way."""
5,A Day To Pick Your own Cotton,I love the characters in this book. It's a simple story but you learn so much about the way things were and about the culture and times of the people it is about.
4,A day to pick your own cotton,"Great read. I did not read the first in the series, but will.. soon. A little history along with the story line.please"
2,What happened to these guys?!,"This album wasn't nearly as good as I was hoping for (fortunately, I only paid a couple of dollars for it). I was accustomed to the heavy guitar-crunch of their earlier release, ""Synaptic Hardware"", which was much better than this rather bland outing. ""Whatever"" is okay -- I'd heard it on a Re-Constriction sampler -- and ""Thinwall Turmoil"" is alright (but there is a better mix of it on the ""Thugs 'n' Kisses"" compilation). After hearing the god-awful ""Immune"" on the soundtrack to ""Mission: Impossible 2"", I had no desire to listen to the next album, ""Tried + True"", which features that song. I read the reviews, though, and I was shocked to hear that they opened for The Psychedelic Furs. Listening to ""Synaptic Hardware"", you could not find two more diametrically opposed bands, but it seems that Tinfed has watered down their sound to the point that they can open for '80s New Wave ""comeback"" (read ""has-beens"") bands."
5,Working with the Law,I think this book is excellent. I would say that everyone would do well to have a copy. This guide is not unlike a roadmap to living. I have other books which go into these subjects but not to this level. The mind must be disciplined and he explains why things go wrong. Man/woman can be their own worst enemy. His analysis and approach to the subjects are to be applauded.
4,Great book terrible spelling mistakes!,The content in this book is fantastic however the spelling is atrocious!The irony is the forward in the book has the publisher saying they corrected many spelling mistakes.How hard is it to proof read something before you publish it!? Especially a classic.
4,WORKING WITH THE LAW,"This is a great book for those wanting to understand how to change their lives. It's an easy to understand ""walk-thru"" of the universal principals - including the Law of Attraction - which THE SECRET expounds on. There are other universal laws that work in conjunction with the Law of Atrraction. I would suggest to the readers that they read WORKING WITH THE LAW, not once but twice, before they can begin to really undersand what THE SECRET is talking about."
1,Buy Standard Deviants,Please FIRST check in Standard DeviantsRefer the same title in Standard DeviantsTeaching Systems and Standard deviants are one and the sameStandard deviants prices are cheaper
4,"Somewhat slower paced than the first two,but enjoyed the new characters","The Reaper's Song is the 4th book in the Red River Of The North series,and it was also an interesting read about the immigrant Norwegian relatives,and some new unrelated newcomers as well. I am very much enjoying reading how this community In North Dakota is growing and what life must have been like for them back in the 1800's in that part of the country especially."
4,Great Story,"Book 4 was still a great story, besides the at times slow movement of the story forward. I appreciated the introduction of some new characters in this book."
4,Very Good,"I think this book and the other three in the series are great. The first book was hard to get into, but did get much better. They show good strong christian values that should be a part of your everyday living."
2,Reference Book,"I was diappointed with this book, it is a gaint reference which directs you to the topic of main concern you are searching for."
2,not the best,"if u want the best book on living without technology, check out the readers digest BACK TO BASICS. It shows u haw to build a house, outhouse, stove, candels, and about solar and wind power. Not this book."
1,"United States Bad, Author good.","as a physician i can tell you that the medical parts of this book are very poor. to cite an example the snakebite section is about thirty years out of date and drinking 'colloidal silver' is just plain stupid. if, however, you believe in global warming, global cooling, the inherent evil of the united states, and have a college degree that you don't use because you are a trusafarian, this book is awesome."
3,"Good, if you can wade through the personal politics","There is some very helpful material in the book, especially on evaluating renewable energy technologies. A HUGE NEGATIVE was having to wade through 50+ pages of the author's half-researched analysis of how humanity is destroying the earth. I guess he felt it necessary to cherry-pick the latest gloom and doom headlines -- even rank-ordering which ones he thinks are most likely, based on his (complete lack of) experience -- to justify the rest of the book. (I did as a professional analyst what he has attempted to do as an amateur with a few one-sided sources.) It was unnecessary, as Mr. Stein is an engineer -- which IS his expertise -- and provides very good advice in that realm, and good, helpful diagrams and warnings as well (I'm an engineer too).BUT, if you can get past the political opinionating and slavish devotion to Jimmy Carter, it's a pretty good book."
1,Global Warming Blather,This book may as well have been written by ManBearPig. Selling books based on politcally polluted and faulty science is no way to help other preppers. I urge the author to keep up with the times and research solar cycles and their effect on weather patterns.
3,Got it at the library.,Amazon kept me hanging for months promising a book they never delivered.I finally got it at the local library.
3,"90% Great, 10% Newage Garbage","Most of this book is very good. It is a good survey of many issues related to self-sufficiency. It has great references that make it easier to find the materials needed for a more in-depth understanding of most of the topics.However, I had the feeling while reading the book was that it was written by Abby (Dharma's mother from Dharma & Greg). Great, pragmatic information is tainted with pseudo-science nonsense and newage garbage. Most of which is harmless, but some of it may be downright dangerous.For example, there is a half page editorial on the moral issues of hunting followed some pages later by a long discussion of tanning. There is a story of how blessing water turned undrinkable swill into sweet healing water. There's enough folk and eastern medical advice to make your head swim.If you believe everything you read, this probably isn't the book for you. However, if you can discern the likely from the silly, you might find this book useful."
4,Good for the beginner,"I am big into weapons and survival lore. I have many works on the subject and this is an all around good beginner guide. I still prefer the SAS handbook but I think the are both good to have in your collection. It writes of and demonstrates lots of good ""what if"" skills that may be lifesaving in dangerous situations. I think that it could have been a little better rounded about firearms but that is my specialty so I am biased. I think it is a definite buy."
4,Easy to read resource,"This book was used as a supporting document for a research paper. I found it easy to read and very comprehensive. I will use this book however as a resources for years for fun activities to do with kids like basket making and gardening or wilderness survival techniques as well. Good read for such a large ""manual""."
2,Not worth more than 10 bucks,I would say this book is worth about 10 bucks. It touches on everything and teaches a little. When technology fails I may use it as kindling. So much missing from a book on self reliance. It basically tells you to go read other books and misses out on the opportunity to actually use all those pages to teach you some skills.
3,An Introduction to Self Reliance.,"If you are looking for a one volume ""how to"" book on this topic you'll be disappointed. The author introduces a variety of useful topics for those interested in self reliance. As a jumping off point this book is fine but a lot of additional research and experimentation will be required before someone would be competent in a lot of these skills and techniques. As an introduction to this mind set the book is fine."
3,A solid overview if you can overlook the pseudo-science,"This book provides a broad overview of the skills and planning considerations for long-term preparedness. It is well referenced and allows the reader to find more detailed discussion of most topics easily. My biggest complaint is the pervasiveness of questionable science and flat out myth. The inclusion of dowsing for water is one of the more eggregious examples. Overall, it a good book but plan on using this to gain a general familarization and as a source for identifying the other books you'll need to be properly prepared."
5,WOW!,"Hard to imagine there's such a book as this one, that includes so much for survival and sustainability in a very readable manner. Not for the faint of heart, as it makes a person both aware of the need for a manual like this as well as how to prepare for any eventuality. Very worthwhile."
3,"Sigh, another one...","Its really quite a 'good' book. Basic generalization of techniques I've used for years. If a person takes this book, and learns the stuff prior to a SHTF crisis, they'd probably be OK. Buy TWO of them, get one dirty, bloody, and tacky with tree-sap, used as a practical field guide. Growing up in the 'poor' south in the '60s I suppose I've really just about seen it all. I keep expecting to find something with fresh, new ideas."
5,A Treasure Trove of Survival Tips,"This is a very thorough book. If you believe in being prepared for any disaster, this is a must have. It will walk you through the needed supplies and preparations for every conceivable disaster - from earthquakes and volcanoes to terrorism and bio-threats - from short term glitches to long-term emergencies. It's a little overwhelming because of the amount of information it contains, but breaking it down by section should make it a little more manageable.It has a great section on growing, foraging, hunting, and storing food. The illustrations of wild edible plants are a great addition, as is the first aid section and the energy, heat, and power section. Some sections made me roll my eyes a little, such as the sections on the author's spirituality and his prophetic notions, but those are small sections, and other than that, I highly recommend the book."
3,Mostly good,"Much of this is good information for people concerned about real sustainable living - not just being prepared for some end-of-the-world scenario. Living a more responsible life is worthwhile.However there are a few drawbacks. In his First Aid information he talks of using the Heimlich Manoeuvre as a strategy dealing with people who are choking. This technique was abandoned by the American Red Cross in 2006. There are other more preferred strategies.Much of the information is specific for Americans - such as edible plants, and so forth. Buying pump-action guns is not an option for many countries. Further all measurements are given in American standards such as pounds, gallons, etc.Further he introduces a number of new age concepts in dealing with people's well-beings - with things such as your Chakras and so on.However each chapter is followed by a good selection for further materials, broken down by topic."
1,a waste of time and money,"This book is a waste of time and money. The first fifty pages had maybe two pages of worthwhile information. The rest is his lectures on religion, peak and every other possible situation that could cause a collapse. I am already convinced it is a waste of my time to read his opinions. I want information that will help me deal with preparedness. The rest of his book is very wordy and the material could be covered in half the space. If you want a long boring read this is the book for you."
3,Okay Start,"As an avid camper I own a few survival books. This book tops the others as it talks about sustainability and the ""long emergency"" The only problem I have with this book is that in many cases it refers to another book. Thus I would have to carry the referenced books as well as the main Stein book. There are times where it puts so little information it becomes useless for some of the chapters. I suggest the Camping & Wilderness Survival: The Ultimate Outdoors Book for a complete reference although it too is large especially for backpacking."
1,Don't get it...,This book looks appealing only to find it tries to do way too much. It tries to cover every subject from cooking to trapping to providing your own western medicine from herbs and chemicals you make yourself. Way too much is covered and little or none in any detail enough to use in the real world. It should have been several books with more details or never been written... Do yourself a favor and do not get this or you will be using it as a coaster the day after you get it...
5,Great Book of Ideas,"Buy This Book... It will inspire you and show you 100's of things you can do right now to be better prepared for any potential disaster that may befall you individually or as a civilization.It will open your eyes to the many of the problems of our post-modern society, and help you steer clear of the traps that exist is our current situation.Just get the book and Read It!You can thank me later."
3,"its a book, good read, useful info","it is worth the price paid for it. Nothing extra special to get a higher rating, nothing wrong to get a lower rating."
5,Self Reliance is awesome,This book has everything you need to feel safe in a post apoptolictic enviroment. While this book is entirly comprhensive it is not insistant on impending doom it simply gives you the tools to survive such a situation.
2,Not what I needed but ok.,"I wanted a simple book on steps to prepare the home for a solar flare event that would shut down power grid and electronics. Basically, how do I protect my home for an extended period of time. This book was too political and just too much of the wrong information for my needs. He did have a lot of referrals on other books to buy to help with specific issues. Specifically, I needed the best generator for esstentials and how to have electrician wire it. And what else do we do to prepare for that event. It did have some information on assorted things like how much water per person for a certain amount of time. But I guess I just wanted a book to tell me, here's what to do, steps 1-2-3- to prevent your home from shutting down in a solar flare event when the electrical grid is gone. I will keep looking for a book that has it laid out easier."
4,Another good survivalist related book to own,"Like the title says, I only gave it 4 stars because I have not read through it. More or less it covers a variety of topics and so far very good. I figured it would be another good book to add to my library ""When technology does fail"". Basically most of the skills and techniques that are in it you can look up on the internet, but for me and probably others it's just nice to have all that knowledge gathered into this book. Not saying EVERYTHING is covered in this one book but, I would say it's a good starting point."
5,Louis Armstrong Greatest Hits CD,"Excellant quality! So glad they made a CD ofsuch an old recording. My cassette copy ofLouis Armstrong's Greatest Hits was wearing out.The other nice feature of this particular CD, isthat it includes Bing Crosby singing with Armstrong,along with some verbal commentary.Definately a treasure!"
5,"A classic screen comedy, as sharp as it is funny","This is one of those old classics that still holds up amazingly well. It's funny how sixty years has seen little change among the upper-class and how poorly it relates to the lower one. This movie doesn't ever seem preachy, though. It's too busy being funny."
4,My Man Godfrey,"I saw this movie when I was younger and enjoyed it. I added to my movie collection, I like old movies."
4,DVD holder,"The product was exactly what I was looking for, easy to assemble. A little heavier than I would have like but seems well made for the price."
1,"Great movie, lousy transfer",I have had a VHS version of this movie for some time that looks just fine. It appears that the DVD makers found the worst film print available to transfer for this DVD version. It is such a disappointment. Buy the VHS or wait for the DVD makers to do a proper transfer.
1,A lousy DVD copy of a FANTASTIC movie,"I was so disappointed in the DVD! A scene is missing, hence some retarded editing. The look itself is pretty bad--the whites are almost blinding in a couple of scenes. Aside from really bad cropping (missing heads) the worst is the horrible sound. The sound is no better and perhaps worse than the VHS copy. Thankfully I got a good price on this DVD--thanks Amazon for putting it on sale because I would be really irritated had I paid full price for it.Advice to potential buyers: get this cheap if you get it at all because you will be disappointed in the quality."
1,"great film, bad DVD","I really like this movie, so I was very disappointed in the DVD. I don't know if it is from a poor print or if it's a technical problem, but it wasn't watchable. Every white area was blindingly bright completely washing out all detail. Even turning the contrast on the TV all the way down and the brightness as far down as possible did not completely mitigate this problem. The releasing company should be ashamed for putting this on the market, even at such an attractive price."
5,My Man Godfrey,"One of the most hilarious comedies of the century! Although filmed in 1936, the movie remains relevent for today. The humor is subtle, in places, and slap stick in others. The pace is quick and one must pay attention or miss something. I have seen it, over and over, but fall over laughing each time I view it! (There's always some little line that was missed in the last viewing.) My teenagers had to watch it several times before they ""got it"", but loved the movie once they got used to the black and white film. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes old movies and/or humor."
1,Buy cheap buy twice!,The movie rocks. The DVD does not. The sound is bad and in some parts of the movie the heads are cut off! Its like one of those movies you down load that have been taped in a cinema!Honestly this movie is so good it deserves a better viewing than the one this cheap DVD offers.I have learned my lesson!!!!
2,Annoying RE logo in the bottom right corner,This is a great movie. However there is an annoying RE logo in the bottom right corner throughout the whole picture. The only reason we do not return it is that it only cost $8... Some day a more professional version will be available and we will purchase it.
4,Pixies!,"I love this movie. It is hilarious and wonderful with a good lesson to learn about our past and possibly our future. I was a bit disappointed in the quality though. Since it is a remastered copy, I thought it should have been much better. But oh, what a movie it is."
3,1st time not completly pleased,"The movie was great but this is the first time the dvd was not perfect it skips near the end which is some of the best part, so even though I have always been pleased with the dvd I have gotten from here I will not want one fom this particular company again"
1,"poor quality of film, silly movie, over-acted","wow. perhaps it is because it is a different era, but the acting is so... predictable and wooden and narrow.The rich folks are all silly boars, the poor folks all kind hearted and intelligent. The over-acting of the family that hires Godfrey, even in a comedy, appear to be caricature's of a Marxist fantasy of wealthy life. The shrill, psychotic characters might be funny, I guess, in another era... I found it grating, boring, and childish. Skip this one."
1,"Good movie, bad copy (critic's coice)","The film itself is teriffic, but get a different version of this movie than the ""Critic's Choice"" one. It's black and smudgy and incredibly difficult to see. ""Digitally remastered"" means absolutely nothing in this case. Spend the extra few bucks and get a better copy of this film."
1,This DVD has the distributor's logo in the bottom right corner of screen,"This title is not the Criterion issue, it is from Reel Enterprises. They put their logo ""RE"" in large letters in the lower right corner of the screen during the film.I paid for this DVD and should not have to watch an ad from some film distributor while I am trying to enjoy the film. ""My Man Godfrey"" gets 5 stars but putting an ad on the DVD or some low rent copy protection gets it one."
4,Good 'Oldie''.,"This is an archetypical 'Oldie' of the best kind. Personally, I found it highly enjoyable and well worth watching. The sound, sensible, and (just about) believable storyline is excellently acted by very good actors.Being made well before the art of 'screen effects' had reached the present high level, one has to make allowances, but the all round quality of this movie is abundantly clear.Lovers of 'modern' action movies, slick productions and/or suspense movies, will not find this to their taste. We 'old timers' lap this sort of movie up!! So will all true lovers of good movies.Powell is superb and Lombard excellent."
1,Can't believe Amazon is selling this!,"This ""remastered"" edition came WITHOUT shrink wrap and it had a clearly photocopied cover. It looks and feels like a bootleg. The disc was not silver. But the worst part is it won't even play... choosing anything from the menu takes you... right back to the menu! That could be a fault with this specific disc, but still highly frustrating.I chose this version based on others reviews and was very dissappointed. Definitely not worth $19.95, or even $1 in my opinion. I really can't believe Amazon is selling a DVD like this.If you really like this movie bite the bullet and get the Criterion version."
5,Powell is smooth and snappy,product came in perfect condition; both color and black and white original played great but it's the suave and charming demeanor of William Powell that makes this such a great movie.
5,It works!,"It took some time, apparently, but they finally have come up with a way toenhance a black and white classic with color tones. The key, I believe, isin the subtle use of colors and the additional hues. The first effort, some20-25 years ago was a disaster. As for My Man Godrey, it remains a great movie."
3,Collector's Edition NOT!!!,"I am very dissapointed in this product.I gave the 3 stars for the quality of the dvd and not the movie which is a 5 star film and one of the best screwball comedies ever made. Nowhere on either the dvd or the case it is in is there any indication of a Collector's Edition. There are no special features in the dvd and the print of the film is in average condition at best! I could not believe in the poor condition of the print! One can hardly see the scenes outside at night. This is the first time that I have been dissapointed in any product bought from Amazon. You should not be advertising this product as aCollector's Edition if it is not one! Please do not advertise this dvd as a collector's Edition. But as I said, this is the first time that I have ever been dissapointed in any product from Amazon and I have purchased so many items that I have been pleased with that I will let this one slide. Thank U very much! Sincerely, smrz!!!"
5,A striking comedy with visible bits of Surrealism!,"The mad side of the usually and accustomed way of living of many of us is revealed with potent humor and bitterness in this supreme comedy where nothing is what it likes.Carole Lombard is the crown person of a very dislocated and eccentric family where Powell is the sane portion term of the equation.The attraction of the opposites and the impossibility of fitting rearrangement in a distorted state of things will become one of the most efficient comedies in he American Story, because everyone of us has found at least one Godfrey through our lives, and when it happens, just smile and laugh after. Because the fakers believe strongly they are smarter than us."
2,No June Allyson!,This title does not have JUNE ALLYSON in it!Why is she listed for this version???AMAZON you need to fix this!
3,Criterion Collection? Really?,"I have purchsed several Criterion Collection copies of movies that always seemed to be better quality versions of movies I had viewed previously. I've always been fascinated by Carole Lombard and Wiilam Powell and recently read that they were married for a few years and divorced shortly before they made My Man Godfrey. I was eager to see the film and noted that Amazon sold several versions of the DVD. I decided to spend the extra money to get the Criterion version. This is the only time I've regretted it. While I enjoyed the movie, the quality of this copy started at poor with notable streaks and fuzziness and improved to fair as I watched the film. If you want to purchase My Man Godfrey, save your money and buy one of the cheaper copies."
1,Appallingly bad transfer,"This must be the VERY WORST film-to-video transfer I have seen in 20 years. The image is murky. Half the time, heads are cut off in mid-forehead. It's as if the upper and lower 15 percent of the movie were simply chopped off. The sound is clear, but the image? I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR buy this product EVER AGAIN.The company which is foisting this horrific transfer off on an unsuspecting public, Big D Entertainment, claims that although the film has been digitally remastered, it has been done so to keep the ""experience of viewing early cinema intact.""This is an outright lie. This simply means that the viewer has to be satisfied with a rotten film print, transferred poorly to DVD, and then poorly digitized.This DVD is similar in appearance to those pirates who sit in the back row of a theater and videotape a major motion picture. It's that poor.DO NOT BUY."
3,"Great movie, but a disappointing copy","My Man Godfrey is a witty screwball comedy with some of the snappiest dialogue of the genre. It is unique in that it is humorous while including some 1930's Depression era social commentary. It compares favorably with ""Bringing Up Baby"" in terms of script and cast quality. The problem with this copy of the movie (hence the 3 star rating) is that a crucial scene is omitted, and, as a result, Carole Lombard's actions for the final 2/3 of the film make no sense. Wait for Public Television or American Movie Classics to run it, their copies are usually complete."
2,"Great movie, terrible transfer to DVD",A brilliant movie with great perfomances but spoiled by at least one major missing scene and numerous washouts (almost going to full-screen white). I would love to purchase a decent transfer of this movie so I hope someone takes the trouble to find a decent original next time. They are out there because public television shows them occasionally
2,"Great Movie, DVD Does It Little Justice","I had hoped for a better transfer, but no such luck. Quality is not markedly better than my old VHS version, and it is *missing a scene* which is in the VHS version (where Powell kicks Lombard out of his room, telling her that as his ""sponsor"" it will reflect badly on her, and thus on him...). This is particularly annoying bacause the later interchange between Lombard's character and Molly (the cook) makes reference to Powell's action, which on the DVD version now has no context. Very disappointing, since this is such a wonderful movie."
2,"Great movie, but bad DVD!","""My Man Godfrey"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. But check your TV listings and record it from the TV. It will be one of the rare times when a late-night TV rerun gives you a more complete movie and better quality than the DVD. This DVD has at least one missing scene. One very important scene is when Irene goes to Godfrey's room and Godfrey tells Irene that she must never enter the butler's room again. This is a crucial scene because later when there is jewelry missing everyone rushes into Godfrey's room, but Irene stands outside at the doorway. Another bad thing about the DVD is the picture is all washed out. This very excellent five-star movie is a 2-star DVD."
2,"Nice Movie, Bad Presentation","Don't buy this one! Nice example of the 30's screwball comedy genre. But this particular DVD version (My Man Godfrey) is badly flawed by the insertion throughout the whole movie of a ""bug"" in the lower right of the picture. The bug is ""RE"" which evidently stands for ""Reel Enterprises,"" the copyright owner for this version. Why would they deface such a good movie by inserting such a distraction? Surely not for the publicity; I'll never buy another product from Reel Enterprises."
2,Criterion DVD an overpriced disappointment,"Unfortunately Criterion has (again) cornered the market on a classic film and no other DVD of reasonable quality exists. This DVD, overpriced as all Criterion entries are, is a disappointment. The restoration is not particularly good, with fuzzy resolution and distortion around the edges in many scenes. The sound quality, too, is well below par for a premium-priced DVD. Compare this disk with the superb DVDs of ""Sunset Boulevard"" (Paramount) and ""All About Eve"" (20th Century Fox). On both of these disks, the picture and sound restoration, as well as the bonus features, far surpass Criterion's ""Godfrey"" at a far, far lower price."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"We purchased this item for a Christmas present for a family member. We were shocked, dismayed & humiliated for giving a gift that was worthless. How can Amazon sell a product that is so obviously damaged. You can't enjoy watching it because it is interrupted with huge black out splices & other poor repairs to the film. The sound seems on hyper speed so hard to make out the dialogue. This is nothing more than a mutilation of the original. Again, DO NOT buy this product."
5,A Great Classic Comedy,"I loved this movie. I really enjoyed watching William Powell. He was such a great actor. Even as a bum living in the dump pile he was still humorous and sophisticated, and kind of sexy. I felt that Powell and Gail Patrick were the greatest actors in the movie, although everyone else also did very well, especially Lombard as the scatterbrain love-sick young lady. I would love to watch this movie over and over again. I wish Hollywood still made movies like this."
3,Why so expensive?,"I rate the film a solid 5, but the average-quality restoration and high price bring the score down to 3 for the Criterion DVD. Yes, it is better than the previous VHS and bargain-basement DVD versions. However, when compared to other companies (e.g., Warners, Paramount, MGM, Fox, and Universal) that have recently produced many DVDs with superior restorations and better bonus features at roughly half Criterion's prices, Criterion no longer seems justified in charging so much money."
1,ugh!,i purchased this film because actor matthew broderick said it is the best comedy ever made. ugh! i can name dozens of films better than this! i have no problem with the seller....the movie just bored me to death! give me frank capra or preston sturges!!
1,Appalling slapstick sans comedy,"God save us from the dysfunctional and unfunny group in this outdated film. Not even the normally watchable William Powell can revive this old wheeze. And the whinging, whimpering and wailing of Carole Lombard is enough to make one homicidally inclined long before the flick is over."
3,Clean but Grainy,"Criterion has taken careful steps to find an unscratched print, but it still suffers from extreme graininess, probably the result of a 16mm transfer. Hopefully, a better original can be found along with someone with the desire put it on blu-ray. My Man Godfrey is one of the best screwball comedies ever made. Powell and Lombard shine throughout this well-written, well-directed film. It is a shame that this sort of genre seems to have given way to what today is labelled as funny. Lombard died early in a plane crash at the age of 33. Powell went on to epitomize Nick Charles in the Thin Man with standout performances through to his last in Mr. Roberts in 1955. Take note, too, of Gail Patrick, the beautiful femme fatale, who plays Lombard's vixen sister, and Eugene Pallette, the foghorned character actor who plays their father. Kudos for all efforts for this all to oft-forgotten work. And what a shame it has to be placed on my ""everyone in it's dead"" shelf, a sad waste of humanity!"
2,My Man Godfrey - Color vs Black & White,"The B&W version I bought from Amazon.com was fine - good drama comedy. However, was disappointed in the color I bought from you next as there were glitches in the colorized version and also missing parts in this version. Maybe the next ""color batch run"" version will be better. If so, I'd like to trade in the last one I bought."
4,Loved Carole Lombard,"The story line was cute, and Carole Lombard was adorable. I just wish that Godfrey showed a little more believable interest in her."
4,Pretty Funny,I thought this movie was entertaining but I much prefer Merrily We Live! They are somewhat similar movies but I preferred the acting and the comedy of Merrily We Live.
5,"Nice transfer, includes the B&W version....","To purists I would say, don't be put off by the colorization that is a feature of this particular DVD. It's a good transfer of a very clean print, and looks great in the black and white version also provided. The colorization is subdued and tasteful, though I still prefer the original B&W version. This film has been in the public domain at least since the beginning of the home video era, and the quality of some budget editions of ""Godfrey"" are truly dreadful. This seems to be a Fox product, and they've done their usual excellent job with this DVD. It's not much for extra features (just the theatrical trailer), but production stills and cast biographies are easy enough to find on the web anyway. For the price, it's a great deal."
3,"Three stars +...Basically even with all previously unreleased tracks, three LPs worth of tunes from CT's...","First three studio LPs. This is whenTom Petersson was real good. I amstill not a big fan of the 12-stringBass, but they actaully started reco-rding in the studio in 1975 with Sou-thern Girls (Elvis was there that dayin Memphis, according to the linernotes in Sex, America, Cheap Trick,which I much prefer since it has allthese tunes and so much more. Get itif you like Cheap Trick when they wereyoung, fresh, but hadn't peaked yet. Ifirst saw them in 1977 and have seenthem 30 or more times since. Theywere better 1981-87 though. No offence,TP..."
1,Terrible recording-video and audio,"Got it at Wal-Mart in the really cheap section, yeah, I shoulda' known better. The video is very grainy and the audio is not even stereo quality in my opinion. This video really sucks. That is not to say that Pavarotti didn't do a great job, he probably did his best as usual, but you can't feel it with this poor quality recording. Very bad, save your money and get the ""Original Three Tenors"" Concert first."
1,Avoid DVDs from Image Entertainment,I ordered STAGE DOOR CANTEEN on May 28. I have yet to receive aDVD! It has not yet shipped. This is irresponsible businessdealing.
2,not hepburn,"This was listed under hepburn. she has a brief cameo at the end of the film. I would not recommend this to someone who thinks thatt this is a hepburn piece.It is a period piece with performances by famous WWII era stars; Ray Bolger, al jolson, and others."
1,Very Disappointing,"When I saw the line-up of this movie, I was looking forward to a wonderful performance. This movie did not meet my expectations. Not only did the flow appear to be stuttered, but also the way the big stars were incorporated into the film left me scratching my head half the time. The actors/actresses seemed to be brought out like trick ponies, pranced for a few minutes, and then sent back to their stable.I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie."
2,Lots of great stars...but not as you remember them!,"I expected more from this star-filled video. In fact, it's a simple story of love found and lost. The stars are not impressive, and I wouldn't recommend this unless you are desperate to see movie stars NOT acting. Yes, Benny Goodman plays and so do other people, but it's not worth the money. If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't buy this. Wanna buy a used video? I'll sell you mine :-)"
2,Ok Movie - Needed More Dancing,"was a little disapointed on the Swing dance scenes, Has a little swing dancing, but not much. Had ""Lotsa"" stars in the movie which made some scenes good."
1,misled,"They did not ship the jars I ordered, but sent what they had. When I called to inquire, they informed me they no longer had the ones I wanted and sent a replacement, without checking with me. The jars they sent were ordinary jars I could get anywhere. Asking if I could return them, I was informed they would email me instructions and a return number. Problem was, they wanted me to pay the return shipping for their error, having already paid shipping to get them to me incorrectly. Not great customer service to say the least! This is the second time I have placed an order on Amazon where the item comes from someone else. Both times there have been problems. So I will not order from Amazon again if the order ships from another vendor."
3,Kempe rocks,"I'm glad to have these reissues. Kempe just does more with the music. I own a lot of the originals on vinyl, and they are some of the richest sonorities I've heard. Too bad these EMI reissues of Kempe have a sound quality that is slightly off...it's kind of tinny."
3,Just for die hard fans.,"Set 1 of the Space 1999 series offers the "" how did it all began "" episode, as well as 5 more from the first season. Even though watching this episodes brings back childhood memories, this first episodes are just plain good. The special effects of this series can look pathetic to todays CGI and the set decorations can look shallow for younger people. ( Specially the ""computer"" ). In short, only for die hard fans."
1,2001 A Space Odyssey The Series,"Previous to ordering this boxed set I had never seen Space 1999. I had heard of it, however, and was intensely curious. If you liked the special effects and character quality of 2001 A Space Odyssey, then this is the series for you. The show has a reasonable amount of 70's style special effects and the story outlines aren't too bad. However, all the characters are completely emotionless and flat. These are the least character driven stories I have ever seen."
1,Notwithstanding the other reviews...,"...which point out the cool special effects, great imaginative story lines and fancy spacecraft, I felt badly let down by the production quality of the DVDs. The content is wonderful, but the transfer was shoddy.Space: 1999 was originally filmed in England, using film stock at 25fps. It has been converted to the US NTSC standard (29.97fps) which in most cases is not a problem, but during action sequences or any time there is a lot of movement on screen, you get a very distracting shudder to the image. This makes it quite uncomfortable to watch, which is a shame, because the Space 1999 stories were great fun."
3,The Return of an Old Friend,"It was nice to see this show again.But given the cost of the individual sets, I was disappointed that the DVDs (I purchased set 1 and 2) didn't have any extra stuff. I was hoping for interviews with the actors and/or some fun 'making of' type of facts."
3,Get It Only If You Loved It As A Kid,"I watched the Space 1999 series when it first came out when I was a 10 year old in the 1970's. As a child I found the imagery to be ___very__ powerful. I always wanted to see the series again as an adult and after all of these years I finally got my chance.As an adult, the imagery didn't catch me. I think my adult mind lacked something that gave the series a special sauce when I was a child.The acting was very wooden and absent of any emotion. It seemed like the characters were medicated.If you were one of the people who saw the series as a kid and are curious about seeing it again get the dvd if you have the cash to spare. It was interesting for me to see the series again.If you are an adult who never saw the series and you are just looking for entertainment get something else."
3,A good set for those nostalgic about the series,"A good set to own for those who remembered Space: 1999 as an interesting show to watch, when they were children. Chief complaints about the series, which appear to be common among most reviews are that this is a science fiction show that ignores any elements or truths about science. Also, the continuity that is present in other science fiction shows is mostly absent in Space: 1999. In other words, don't expect to find any rich character development ongoing through either season.The first DVD set does not have any excellent episodes, although it does have the very first episode, Breakaway, that started it all. The most impressive aspect of the series episodes are the sets, especially the Eagle spaceship, which has withstood the test of time, and still looks very realistic."
1,Not what I was looking for,I wanted a book that would help me with at-home handyman jobs that my husband did and did not teach me how to do.
4,Listen and Enjoy,"Those of us that danced through the 80's will certainly rise again. There is, however, one glaring omission - Sharing Your Love. Aside from that, re-groove to You Are My Melody, Change of Heart and the other tracks."
4,Impressed,"I enjoyed this cd very much. I was impressed with it because it had some great dance tunes that I did not know but sounded familiar. Lover's Holiday was sampled in the Janet Jackson song All For You. I knew that tune sounded retro or something. Anyway, I bought the CD for one song and got plenty more than what I asked for. I didn't really know much about this group. However, I definately got impressed. So, if you like great 80's dance funk and soul music this is a wonderf ul CD. I would advise listening to samples on amazon before you make a purchase on a CD that you may not be familiar with. I did and it was worth it."
3,Sometimes Change is not for the better,"Spanning time with Change, an American/Italian gumbo pot. Finds Luther Vandross, finds Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, finds Chic's sound but after all that, Change can no longer predict their future past 6 albums and 14 hits. Not bad tho'.Post-disco hit ""A Lover's Holiday"" kicks it off. Then the two Luther Vandross vocal tunes ""Searching"" and ""The Glow Of Love"". Then there's ""Paradise"" and the Chic-sound-a-like ""Hold Tight"". The dance grooves keep comin'.While the dance grooves do keep comin' (like I said), from start it's happening from the 7th song in, it gets boring and the excite is gone. But within their 5 to 6 album career of hits on one disc for a great price, who's complaining?"
5,"""Say you love me again""","Man, I love this song. ""Say you love me again"" makes me wanna just fall in love. Anyways, what a great CD. If you like listening to retro and appreciate soul, then you should purchase this CD. ""Say you love me again"", ""Hold Tight"", ""Change of heart"", and ""You are my melody"" are my favorite songs. However, there other great tunes like ""Searching"" and ""The glow of love"" featuring Luther Vandross' early years with the band. We all miss you Luther!.Enjoy!"
3,Luther's songs,"The first two songs are sung by Luther Vandross and are by far the best cuts on the CD. The other songs are okay, but they are true 'cheesy' 80's...be prepared!"
3,The Very Best of Change,"The only song which really appealed to me is ""Lover's Holiday"". Not sure if the Group had any other hits other than this."
1,False advertisement,"I was very happy to finally be able to order this CD knowing I could hear the long version of Searching....just to find out that it was the short version as it was with the order I placed with CD Universe. If you have the long version of this on a CHANGE CD, I will be more than happy to order it, but as for the one I just received....I am sending it back....I am very disappointed.....Thank youFlo Worsham"
3,The Very Best of Change,"Lovers' Holiday and Searching. Those two songs say much about the group, but not all! Give them a chance and listen. The CD is priced to sell, and you won't be sorry. The most popular songs (that I just mentioned) featured Luthor Vandross before he exploded onto the R&B/Pop scene! Three stars!"
5,Distort is very similar to Vortex,"If you were considering Collide and never heard them before, don't expect something that is going to fit in with everything else but expect something that is going to knock your socks off. The only music I'll listen to round the clock is Collide, a pair of headphones and a moderate volume level in a dimly lit room will set a wonderful mood for you to listen to Collide. All their albums have a similar feel and I would suggest Some kind of Strange Chasing the Ghost and Beneath the skin for someone who has the more open mind, Vortex is an Album I believe anyone can love its not as abstract as the others and is wonderful for dancing and I can guarantee once you hear vortex you'll want to hear everything else. Though I'm glad to have heard their original music first. Collide is probably the first of a new breed of music not rock nor techno. Abstract music is not something you come by often and this is THE BEST."
3,A Good Tale,"While not the best Conan tale I have ever read; Red Nails evoked a sense of mystery, savage brutality, and decadent morality found in many of the Conan tales. The story was a quick read but very enjoyable for anybody: those new to Hyboria and those that have been traveling with Conan for quite some time."
5,conan,i like the book conan is one of my favorite characters. I have always liked to read about the many adventures of conan.
3,Conan,"Short and simple, however predictable and I did not find a real connection with the people in the book and at time's the descriptions seem wordy. but over all a quick and delightful read."
3,The first 100 pages...,"we're just ok for me. Not the best Conan story I've ever read, but still worth the time to read."
5,Excellent Pair of Speakers,"This is an excellent pair of speakers. I am very pleased with their quality having used them for about two months. I have them hooked up to a Kenwood KR-9600 and they work wonderfully. Excellent highs and lows along with excellent mids. With the KR-9600 I can get these speakers to have a wider frequency range than stated. The speakers work well by themselves and I would not bother to get a sub. I have my computer hooked up to the KR-9600 and I play my cds this way. I can raise the bass even more by doing this. The only downside is the price; however, they are well worth the price. The grills are alright but I took mine off because they look cooler. All in all this is a very good pair of speakers and with the proper equipment one can get them to excede their standard specifications."
4,Good speakers for the price.,"For the price they sound great. They lack in bass some, there is no plate on the back to wall mount it. I am using them for computer speakers and they sound better then any speakers marketed for computers. I prefer two of these with a decent receiver over a 5.1 logitech computer system. If using for a home theater I would make sure to pair with a decent subwoofer."
4,a bit large but very good.,i intended to use these speakers for my rears but they are a bit large. if i hadn't also ordered monitor 50's i would have used these as fronts. but they do a good job as rears for my 5.1 system now. very powerful and a decent amount of bass as well. they also look very classy.
4,good for $120-$150,"I used the Polk Monitor 40s for about two weeks without a subwoofer; they require a subwoofer unless you only listen to classical and jazz music.I'm currently using a 2.1 setup:Denon AVR-591, 2x Polk Monitor 40s, Emotiva 10"" sealed subwoofer. For $120-$150, I don't think you'll find a much better value other than craigslisting some quality used speakers (I didn't go that route because I have terrible luck with used electronics)."
3,Polk Monitor 40,Great speaker for the money. Paid $140 plus shipping. But lacks sophistication. Good for the kid's room period. Boomy bass. Heard that Matt Polk sold out and Polk has become stablemates with Definite Technologies. It shows.
3,Polk monitor 40,These are good speakers for the price.They have googd sound that could beenhance using bi-wire cables.
3,The worst of the series.,"I love these books. Full of great quality pictures, reviews/essays and notes on the text. However, Jurgen Muller's BOOKS OF THE '90s is by far the worst I've read out of the series so far. Whereas the '70s book listed all the iconic films of the 1970s, Movies of the 90s excludes some of the most definitive - such as Reservoir Dogs - and opts for stuff that wasn't even very good. (Such as Crash.)If this was a list of the iconic films of the '90s such as ""Films of the 70s"" was, then perhaps including Dumb and Dumber also would have been a smart move. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it's better than many of the mediocre films they include here.It's not a bad list, it's just missing a lot of titles I'd personally include, making up for their absence with mediocre titles that aren't even very popular."
4,Very Informative,"This book was very informative. Could have used more color pictures and better detail on the reprints of the articles, but it served the purpose of setting the factory items on the 351C I needed to put mine together."
4,Very good book on the 351C,If you're looking for some interesting articles on the 351 Cleveland engine this is an excellent book. While there is nothing recent in the book there is still a great deal of information about the 351 C and it's development as a racing engine for Pro Stock and Nascar circle track use. Getting to see some of the techniques used by Bud Moore back in the days when Nascar stock car racing used production based engines was really very interesting.Recommended.
5,Childrens TV at it's best,"A wonderful transfer, nostalgic, all that ... but more than anything else this is a template for how childrens TV should be.After watching a few episodes the format is clear: Some complex endeavour has failed. Those in charge, army generals, flight controllers and skyscraper managers attempt a correction. They are not bumblers and their heroics are serious even though they don't succeed. When International Rescue comes in, they have to work at it too, preparing, organizing. Nothing comes easy; the puppets even sweat!Anyone who watches this show will come to understand that technology by itself is not a panacea, that it requires painstaking care and human oversight, that it often fails, and that it takes time to get things done, thus teaching the need for patience and persistence, something we tend to forget about in this day and age of ""internet time""."
5,Looks like I remembered as a kid,"Heck of a lot of fun watching this as a child, and still entertaining as far as I'm concerned. Corny and hokey, but it's puppets for gawsh sakes.... and they save the world all the time....with all those cool gadgets and gizmos...I Love it.... you might as well..."
2,no-stalgia,"When I was a kid I remember sitting in front of the television eagerly waiting for the Thunderbirds to come on. But that was then. There weren't that many shows for young audiences and 24-hours-a-day cartoon channels didn't yet exist...As much as I played up the Thunderbirds to my six year old son,and as excited as he was when I first popped in the VHS, the story did not hold his attention for more than ten minutes and after a good half hour of fidgeting, he finally admitted that he was bored. Maybe for older children?"
3,This DVD set has some good episodes,"One of the best episodes of Space: 1999 that I remember seeing as a child was The Last Sunset, which I did not see again for more than 25 years. I liked this episode as a kid, and I enjoyed watching it again on this DVD set. I thought that the story of having the moon develop an atmosphere like earth's was very interesting. Another episode that I remember as a kid was Alpha Child. I think that the most interesting part of the story was that the first child of Moonbase Alpha grew up and became an adult at an unusually fast rate, and was temporarily deaf and was incapable of speech for part of the episode. There was a certain sense of awe and wonder about this episode, the child was very enigmatic, and so was the story."
2,Too religious...,"I bought this book because the consumer reviews were quite positive and because it seemed to fit the self-help profile I was looking for. I was disappointed to discover after reading only a few pages, God, the Lord, and spirituality became such a large part of the material. Had I known that there would be discussion of God in helping understanding emotional problems, I would not have purchased....Just a fair warning to the non-religious or non-believers."
4,Two Coming of Age Tales,"It's a great story about the coming of age of two males - 12 year old Marcus, son of a weird, New Age London mom - and Will, 36 year old bachelor boy living off his father's royalties for a notorious Christmas jingle. It is unclear which is the more mature as Will joins SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together) in order to meet hot chicks. In the process he invents an imaginary son, wife and hilarious circumstances. While on a SPAT picnic he meets Marcus and despite themselves, they become close.Summary - Fiona (Marcus's mom) tries to commit suicide, Marcus struggles to stay upbeat despite the attempt and his daily torments at school. At least he meets and falls for an older teen girl who has her own problems and in the end all concerned manage to work out there problems and procede to the next stage of life."
3,by Anne,"The book ""About a Boy"" is written by Nick Hornby. The content is based on the favourite theme of the author. The book deals with a deliberate single man who doesn't care about other people and their problems. After he has met a little boy named Marcus he goes through a change. Now he gets in conversation with his environment and sympathizes. The content tries to commit that people shouldn't be so egoistic and have to be more open. But all in all I wouldnßt recommend the book because the theme of the book isn't much complex. So the story gets a little bit boring."
4,The Unraveling of a Stoical Man,"My friend has told me that there is no such word as ""stoical"" - I contend that if that is true, there is at least a beautiful and poignent description of my made up word found in Will and Marcus. On the surface it seems like a ""coming of age"" story concerning a 36-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy, but deep down there seems to be a undercurrent of someone struggling to understand what it means to feel and to live with people in community and to lvoe them through their messy moments and their bright spots as well. It's a well-written and funny book worth the time and joy."
4,"Great follow up to ""High Fidelity""","Being a music obsessed geek, ""High Fidelity"" is, naturally, one of my favorite books of all time and while ""About a Boy"" couldn't have possibly been as powerful, I enjoyed it nearly as much. A funny and charming story to begin with but I thought that the incorporation of the Nirvana stuff was a stroke of genius. I'm sure that critics will eventually begin griping about how *all* of Hornby's books are about immature, pop music and/or sports obsessed men in their 30's but Hornby is to the immature, pop music and/or sports obsessed men in their 30's genre (if you can call it that) what John Grisham is to earnest legal thrillers or Danielle Steele is to trashy soap operas."
4,A unque coming of age story-a boy teaching a man to grow up,"Nick Hornby does it again--that free flowing stream of conciousness writing he does so well works beautifully in this comical novel of two men--one twelve year old going on forty and one forty year old, going on twelve. They are infectious characters with blunt and painful answers to life's most uncomfortable moments but ultimately break your heart with their sincerity. It's heartfelt and funny--a great follow up to ""High Fidelty""."
4,What were they thinking of when the made that cover?,"If you've never read Fever Pitch or High Fidelity than you should enjoy About a Boy. Enjoy, not rave, I suspect. It's definitely not his best effort. I'd wait for it to come out in paperback or borrow it from some hardcore Nick Hornby fan that probably rushed out and bought it the first second it was available (like me). Try the Rachel Papers, by Martin Amis if you liked High Fidelity, or Alain de Botton's work. And as an aside, I think the cover is pedophilic and weird."
5,Muy divertido. Muy descriptivo.,"Edad no es lo mismo que experiencia. Y es increible como la gente mas distinta de nosotros es la que mas nos puede enseñar.Mas alla del estilo de vida de Will, o de su relacion con las mujeres, es de notarse la manera en que interactua con Marcus, y como esa relacion inicial de ""maestro"" y ""alumno"" lentamente va evolucionando a una relacion de pares.La experiencia y vivencias de Will ayudan a Marcus a entrar en el mundo adolescente, y paradojicamente la misma relacion ayuda a Will a entrar al mundo adulto, al menos emocionalmente hablando.Este es un libro muy divertido, y es de esos raros ejemplares que tendran atractivo para un muy amplio rango de mentalidades y edades."
1,Having read the book in class - by Sara Schütz,"When I read the reviews of this book by other customers, I thought it would stay pretty close to the surface. But when I read the book by myself, I found out that there where some unexpected depths. But those depths were not numerous and they were too fast settled. I disliked the ending of the story it abolished the big differences between the characters. This made it very uninteresting for me because I think it is very flat to just adapt the characters to each other. I learned nothing from the book and it gave me nothing very emotional so it is no book I would feel reading again. The language of the book is not very poetic or even demanding so there was nothing I wanted to read twice just to enjoy it.But all in all I think the book is okay if you have to read it (in class). At least, it could have been much worse."
2,"Highly, highly overrated.","Nick Hornby writes reasonably well, and the premise of About a Boy is, in theory, promising. However, the characters come across as flat and fairly unconvincing, and the effect of the novel does not do justice to the potentially great themes contained therein. It seems fitting that Hornby's books become popular movies; they are quick and dirty entertainment, which is fine, but I would not call this a powerful, or even very interesting, work."
3,got weak in the end,"Is it just me, or does Nick Hornby have a hard time resolvinghis books? I really enjoyed the majority of this book. There are several hilarious and touching scenes, like the disfunctional christmas party. However, the end struck a bad note with me--I do not think one should settle for mediocracy but that seemed to be the conclusion. So 4 stars for the entertainment, 2 for the philosophical difference, thus I give it a 3."
1,What A Disappointment,"I found a hardcover of About A Boy in a remaindered bin, and bought it hoping I would soon discover what all the hype was about re. High Fidelity. I hope that High Fidelity is much better than About A Boy, because this novel was utterly lacking in positive qualities. The best that I can say about it was that it was occasionally amusing. On the whole, it was a disappointment. I was not interested in any of the characters. The writing style was high schoolish, with an even lower vocabulary level. The brushes with suicide were poorly done, and at the end of the novel I was so fed up I just skimmed through the last forty odd pages to see if there was anything worth reading. There wasn't."
3,My son read this for school.,Assigned summer reading so my son automatically hated it.It helped to read the story and watch the movie although my son didn't really like either.I thought the book was merely OK.
5,"Simply Outstanding, and a lot of fun...","What a great and fun book to read. I have not watched the movie, but this is just excellent. The way the writer describes the different situations, and the different characters is just outstanding.What a relationship between Marcus (the boy) and Will, they both needed each other, and they were so cool about it. They got to a point that they had to face reality, and that by itself just created one of the best win-win situations around.Never a dull moment in the book, and you get so attached to every story, and can't wait to see what goes on next...as I said just outstanding, and so much fun"
4,an amusing read,"I wasn't expecting this to be an analytical and introspective book, but it was. Some parts of that kinda slowed the story down sometimes, but for the most part, this was an enjoyable read. There were quite a few amusing parts, which I enjoyed. The relationship between do-nothing Will and picked-on Marcus develops into a strange father-son, older brother-younger brother type thing, but in the end it works."
3,dont give up on hornby,"this 3rd hornby production is also unfortunately his weakest. as others have commented, the book allows one to flick cheerfully from one setting to the next, perfect accompanyment to your favourite cds and not the other way around. if this is your first hornby, give the guy a second chance and try the much cleverer 'high fidelity'."
2,"A terrible dissapointment after ""High Fidelity""","The story had potential, but Hornby never delivered.I even went back and re-read ""High Fidelity"" to make sure I still found that book an intelligent and wry look at twentysomething culture. Yep...it was as good as I'd remembered, which only disappointed me more with the follow-up ""About A Boy."""
5,Addictive and hilarious!,"From 8:15 yesterday morning my eyes had been glued to this novel. I loved it. Conversations between personas, especially Will and Marcus, are so quirky and make you laugh out loud. Nick Hornby's characters are vivid and alive. The events throughout the reading can be so horrifying, pleasing and hilarious. During the last twenty four hours my parents had to suffer my reading the best parts of the book to them. I was scared that maybe towards the end of the book I would get tired of everything, but unlike most books read in a short period of time, I didn't. It all went quickly and easily like the breeze. I recommend this book to anyone!"
3,Only buy it if you are a big Nick Hornby fan,"I was disappointed by this effort. Though there are some clever moments, the book lacked the heart or soul I expected."
4,Another worthwhile read from Nick Hornby.,"To begin, I must state that I stumbled accross Hornby during my stay in Nottingham, England last year. I read the hilarious tale: Fever Pitch. I was hooked. Hornby writes in a fashion that is easy-going, entertaining, and introspective. This mode transfers to his second novel: About a Boy. I think the life of Will is the bachelor in every man, and the life of Marcus is the boy in every man. This statement does not segregate women - it simply expresses an emotional and reflective view of manhood and the pursuit of maturity! The development of Hornby's characters in all of his books to date, reveals the simply complex nature of life. And as Will would say, ""It is just life, don't take it too seriously."" Bravo Mr. Hornby on another success."
4,Almost 5 stars,"This being the second novel of Mr. Hornby's I read (High Fidelity being the first), I will definetly be reading any future novels by this author. Why? It is hilarious and real!Many of the conversations that take place between the charatcers are funny and ridiculous, but while reading them you can't help but think that you yourself had these same conversation with yourfriends and family they were just as quirky and odd in retrospect. That is the strength of Mr. Hornby's novels- the insight in our behaviors.Some of the scenarios were slightly predictable, but that isn't all that bad, because you find youself turning the pages anyway to see the spin on them.The book wrapped up a bit too quickly for me and there were one or two questions I would have likes addressed, but they are not critical in enjoying thsi novel.Looking forward to the next one."
5,Pleasant read about a boy and a man,"I had read this book when it first came out, shortly after discovering Nick Hornby and ""High Fidelity"". I loved the writing, the characters and the story. I could easily picture myself in both the protagonist roles, the boy and the man. The only thing that I'd change about the novel would be the climax. While reading it, it seemed fine, but when the movie was released I greatly preferred the way it was done on film."
4,Summary of About a boy,"Summary of ""About a Boy""The book ""About a boy"" written by Nick Hornby and published in 1998 deals with Marcus (12) and Will Freeman (36) ,who change in the course of the book. Marcus is an outsider.He hasn't got any friends because he is different from the other children his age.He has got just one person ,his mother Fiona.She is divorced and just split up with her boyfriend. But one day Marcus meets Will .Will is a very ""cool"" person because he knows what you must wear for being cool and he knows modern music bands.After some time become Marcus and Will become friends.With a sense of humour the author explores the connections people make when the so-called ideal family model does not apply.Because of the snotty writing style everything seems realistic,the dialogs are very expressive.It's a great book,but I think you have to read it at least twice to notice every little detail."
5,This is a must read!,"I am ashamed to say that I did not read ""About a Boy"" until I heard about the movie. However, I did read the book before seeing the movie. I highly recommend this novel. ... Everyone remembers what it was like to be an awkward kid who didn't really know who they were outside of their parents. Not to give too much away but, the suicide of Kurt Cobain is mentioned in the book and how it affects one character.... READ THIS BOOK!Trust me, you will not be sorry for an instant. In short it is about being human."
4,good book,"My girlfriend recommended this book to me while i was in the hospital. I was skeptical to start, but i really got into it. Fun to read."
5,Laughed myself silly....,"Really enjoyed this book....Hornby has a style that is unique, insightful, funny and surprising. He can whip up an account of the simplest of conversations and put a twist to it that leaves you full of admiration. His command of the English language is superb.Fully recommended, couldn't put it down, looking forward to the movie."
3,Pure Entertainment,"The book ""About a Boy"", written by Nick Hornby ""Fever Pitch"" ""High Fidelity"", is not a book everybody should be desperate to know. It is like Hollywood - interesting but somehow blank.A 12-years-old schoolboy named Marcus, an outsider at his new school meets the 36-years-old un-married selfish, arrogant Will, who is having fun all day, living on the money his dad earned. Marcus has more traits of an adult when Will and the other way around Will is more a teenager then Marcus. Will helps Marcus to become normal, to get in contact with other pupils and to deal his problems with his suicide-endangered mother. On the other side, Marcus helps Will to become an adult. In the end Will cares for other persons, thinks about the others and him and Marcus is a normal teenager.Of course, the book is nice to read (some parts are), but as said in the first lines, it is entertainment. After you had read the book you will forget it.Sorry for mistakes - i'm from Germany. :-)"
3,"Review of ""About a Boy""","""About a Boy"" entertains you very well. It is a witty and nice production after the best seller of ""Nick Hornby"".The movie swings between a comedy and a tragedy with dry typical British humour and with dramatically moments.""Hugh Grant"", who plays as the main character the self-centred Will, and ""Nicholas Hoult"", who plays the peculiarly Marcus, convince in their parts completely. It is fun to watch them. Besides the music is fantastic, then they are always the right musical mood for the respective situation.The ending is a little bit too funny and ""Hugh Grant"" chances very rapide from ""Saulus to Paulus"", too. Proceeding from his character at the beginning, he actives too sensitive at the end.In all a fantastic movie, who looks at the loneliness from different points of view. Besides a very funny comedy, who knows to entertain you.Kathleen"
2,Not up to par,"I loved Nick Hornby's earlier novel High Fidelity but About a boy just didn't do anything for me. I had trouble staying interested in the story and even though the lead character does some wacky things, it just wasn't enough. Very unrealistic. Maybe my expectations were too high after loving High Fidelity."
3,I'm not sure what I was expecting,"After High Fidelity, I imagined this might be an ultimate male-bonding/growing up novel. An antidote to selfish 30-something serial dating creature of habit lifestyles, learning to become a human being? Not really. Actually the characterizations are slightly too thin early on for me to take Hornby's motives seriously, and it eventually makes it impossible for him to make his point because he's too interested in appearing funny and setting up the farce side of the equation to completely nail the bonding/growing up side of things. A shame, because he had all the trappings available, and certainly has the talent."
3,"Starts out great, then loses steam.","About a boy starts out with a wonderfully funny, wry yet warm-hearted style with interesting, real-feeling characters. Unfortunately, the quality of the humor, story and style slowly but consistently dwindles until there is a faint feeling of relief at having finished the book."
4,Great!,Hornby has a knack for drawing empathy for his characters. Both Will and Marcus have their odd behaviors which are hilarious. Great book!
5,"Light, Funny and Entertaining","Nick Hornby writes a funny yet endearing novel, that kept me reading from the moment I opened the book. He is sharp and witty. The dialougue is quick and flows. The characters are often hilarious, and definitley ineteresting. This was one of the best reads I have had in awhile."
2,Not as good as High Fidelity,"I was anxious to read this book, after thoroughly enjoying High Fidelity. Although About a Boy starts out strong, it quickly loses steam (both in terms of humor and subject matter). Compared to High Fidelity, About a Boy was sophomoric in its observations of single parenthood and of a child growing up without a father -- a true disappointment."
3,"Actually, it's about two boys","Hi Fidelity' was hilarious, 'About a Boy' (about two boys, actually) was funny but also a little tragic and not quite as good. It makes fine reading, though. Mr. Hornby is definitely a gifted writer. Looking forward to his next novel."
4,Great summer read; real substance beneath the comic surface,"A refreshing look at the business of growing up, for a twelve year old, and a thirty something. (Hint: there could be two ""boys"" here ...). I often laughed out loud: my wife thought I was going soft, until she read it and did the same.If you like the comic writing style Douglas Adams, and if you enjoyed ""The Diary of Adrian Mole"", then you'll love ""About a Boy""."
3,read it only because it's Nick Hornby,"I decided I wanted to read this book for two reasons. 1) I have read High Fidelity, and have grown a great respect for Nick Hornby and 2) I heard it was coming out at the theatre, and I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. I finished the book in a couple days. It was indeed a fast, enjoyable read. BUT, it didn't offer the same kind of humour High Fidelity did, possibly because of it's 3rd person narrative. Either way, I gave it three stars because I expected more laughs. And, in the end, looking back on the novel, I came to the conclusion that nothing really happened. BUT, that's my opinion, and I think if you've read other things by Hornby and enjoyed them, then you should read this simply because. Now I'm off to see it in the theatres!"
3,"Entertaining, but more than a bit syrupy","Feel free to believe the Nick Hornby hype--well, some of it anyway. High marks for crafting a well-paced, entertaining character study here, despite the absence of any real plot. This is a skilled author who definitely knows what he's doing. I'm certain he had the screenplay in mind on every page, as well as the house in the country the royalties would bring him. Although a cut above American mass market novelists, it might only be the British angle that sets Hornby apart from his colonial counterparts. Luckily the author keeps his characters progressing by continually telling the reader of the exact personality changes taking place. I find it far too challenging to simply observe character development through words and actions.It will definitely help you forget about the uncomfortable seats on your next 2-hour plane ride, but so would a box of Twinkies and a couple beers. You choose your own poison."
3,"Not as good as ""High Fidelity"" but worth the read","Very similar to High Fidelity, ABOUT A BOY manages to take the insightfulness of the first novel and fuse it with a more Seinfeldian plot-line. The result is not quite as satisfying, but well worth purchasing."
2,Dissapointing follow up to an incredible debut.,"About a Boy was extremely anticipated after reading Hornby's first novel, High Fidelity. I had picked up High Fidelity on a hunch an was amazed. Never before had I identified myself so much with a literary character. This book made me think, laugh, and even cry a little. I was amazed at Hornby's ability to absolutely nail the male psyche in such a clear manner. High Fidelity actually helped me come to terms with some of my ""issues."" With that in mind, I rushed to the store to purchase ""About a Boy"". What I discovered left me sadly disappointed. Where was the wit, and insight that fueled me through High Fidelity? Although this book was clearly written, it failed to inspire thought or concern. The plot didn't flow and try as I might, I absolutely didn't care about any of the characters. They wear dull, lifeless, and uninspiring. What happened Hornby? Please, please try again. Eagerly awaiting the next one- joe"
3,Is an okay read...,"I basically bought this book only owing to the movie... Is undoubtedly a very nice read; makes a lot of sense to many people across the globe, I'm sure... As for writing, its kind of cool, though a bit cheeky at times, anyway makes sense since it was never meant to be a Hemingway novel...A very nice reading for good time-pass....Subhasish GhoshSt. Cross CollegeUniversity of Oxford"
4,wavering between 3 and four,"Like High Fidelity, About A Boy made me laugh out loud. Light and breezy, this book makes a great entertaining read. My only qualm (and this is why I'm wavering between three and four stars) is althought it was fun to read, it was so light I felt like the book might float out of my hands. (Even with the undercurrents of divorce and suicide inhabiting the book). A novel does not have to be filled with some heavy duty message in order for me to enjoy it, I suppose what it is about the book that reads funny, is the scary subjects within it, they feel out of place next to Hornby's witty tone. Something doesn't match up quite right, and it isn't that humor can't be found in the dark. That aside, Hornby is a talented and engaging writer, and if you liked High Fidelity I say read this one too(I liked High Fidelity more)."
4,"Great to read following ""High Fidelity""","Did you read ""High Fidelity""? If you liked that, then CHECK THIS OUT. Same dry humor. Great writing. Funny. Flows. I really cared about the main characters (man & boy) and loved reading about them growing up--both of them. Also, do check out the film, ""High Fidelity."" I loved it."
4,Soundtrack for a teenage crush.,"This is by no means the most original album ever made, but it successfully encapsulates the zeitgeist of the ""twee"" indie pop scene. These songs are soaked in Stereolab-esque keyboards, jangly guitars, and honey-sweet girl-boy vocals in the school of My Bloody Valentine. Pretty typical Slumberland fare, but definately worth a listen if you're a pop fan."
2,Not for her fans of Romance,"Nora Roberts as JD Robb for whatever reason flips to the far side of her usual tales of love and courage. This very dark series explores horrific sexual crimes graphically described. It takes place in the future when there no longer exists what we know as polite or respectful language or deference to women or young people. Everyone is vulgar both the men and the women in their language and the accepted way they communicate and interact. The main character Eve is fashioned after your hard core homicide detective. She rough and vulgar and prone to violence and anger, barely feminine at all. Even the sex among the main characters is described as violent with the same dark descriptors as the sexual crimes committed in this book. Not sure what audience she was trying to reach, but it's not her usual readers."
2,NOT real henckels,"These knives are marginally ok, at best. They bear the Henckels name, but are NOT German (made in China!) or even close to a ""real"" Henckels. In addition, the serrated edges are horrible for trying to do any real slicing. I was very disappointed with the set... and plan to go with a Wusthof Santuko the next time I buy."
5,YES!!!,"Being a senior single, I LOVE this for being able to go from fridge to oven (toaster) and to plate!!! I can also freeze and all~~~"
3,Not your classic orginal Pyrex design,"It is pyrex glass, but not original Pyrex quality.Differences vs. original Pyrex containers:1: glass not as thick although adequate.2: no lips or other shapes on the top edges for grasping. The top edges are simply straight up making it difficult to grasp expecially when full of hot food.3: covers of each container are not pyrex, but thin plastic. The original pyrex containers always also came with Pyrex lids.So there is a trade-off in the low cost. Next time I would probably just buy the more expensive original designs..."
3,Not very well packed,They just arrived in the package they were in no packing around them ?What the hell six more words required
5,great deal,"bought for my new single dwelling apartment, great for cooking in oven or microwave, also great for refrigerated food storage with included lids"
3,Nice set of glasses,Good for the value but i would have liked'em if they come with red lids.But i know that i was buying blue lids so couldn't complain.
2,Not a tight seal,"The round Pyrex storage container lids seal tightly, but these do not. Liquids spill with minor tilting and freezer burn is a problem."
2,too small,much smaller than anticipated unless you are going to make one brownie in each one you may not get what you are expecting.
5,Great Set!,I bought this set to add to my freezer/fridge/microwave storage containers. I've gone from Tupperware with its warping lids to Pyrex sets and have never looked back. Sturdy non-warping lids. Even looks good on the table.
3,"Good dishes, lids are hard to use","These are nice dishes, just what you would expect from Pyrex.The lids are hard to put on. I can do use them, but my mother can't. They are both hard to put on and hard to take off, and more than occasionally I discover them in the fridge with a corner of the lit not entirely seated on the dish.Five stars for the glass dishes, but the product overall deserves three stars because they are sold with lids that should work better and be easier to use."
5,These work great.,"I use these for storing in the fridge section, not the freezer. I also have the round bowl set but these stack much more efficiently. Unlike the plastic containers, these don't stain no matter what you put in them The lids are super convenient. I've had my set for several years, run everything through the dishwasher and no problems at all. I like these better than the plastic leftover containers. For the money, they're hard to beat."
1,Not safe for food storage,"I purchased this product approx. 12 months ago, and have had pieces shatter in the oven at 400 degrees, in the microwave when they come out of the fridge and now an edge just came off when I took the lid off the refrigerated item - getting glass into the dish of food. Now they are headed for the dumpster. Save your money and avoid the stitches."
4,"remember, 6 PIECES includes the lids!","These are great, I just wish I read the product title more carefully. You're getting 3 storage containers. The largest one is an awkward size--too deep for a casserole dish but too wide for a good soup container. The lids aren't meant to make a perfect seal but are certainly better than your average thin plastic tupperware. Not much else to say, just make sure you understand what NOT to do with them (e.g. put the lids in the oven, etc)"
5,Good to Get Rid of the Plastic!,"After reading about all the scary stuff with BPA in plastics, and all kinds of bad effects I decided to go back to glass to store and re-heat my food. Pyrex is still the best: from freezer/fridge to oven/microwave to table. Safe and does the job. These are also quite attractive and you can serve from them. Okay everybody -- throw out your plastic and go back to the basics with glass. It is not paranoid, just smart. These are good value too."
2,You won't just fall asleep. You'll turn over.,"It would take truly magnificent conducting to make anyone accept the flashlight of Helga Dernesch's voice in lieu of the laserbeam of Birgit Nilsson's. And although Karajan is capable of truly magnificent conducting, he must have been taking cold medicine when he recorded this. The ""turgid tempi"" noted by the Amazon reviewer are just deadly. For example: the brooding music for strings in the prologue to Act III - so harrowingly melancholy in the legendary Bohm performance - is taffy-stretched into an almost ambient lugubriousness. A love-it-or-hate-it performance? Okay. I hate it."
5,The Best 'Tristan',"This was the first 'Tristan' I ever heard, so I'm somewhat partial. I've always been an admirer of Karajan and his attention to detail. The performance shines from the quiet opening note, to the last fadeout of the final love/death duet. An important note here is that to truly appreciate this magnificent recording, one needs to get hold of the 1994 remastered recording which is somewhat scarce. It corrects a lot of problems in the original version where the chorus was too distant, the sound muddled and poor editing. This new recording makes all the difference.Ms. Dernesch takes a lot of flack for her performances, but I find no fault with her here and Vickers is in fine form.Besides 'The Ring', to me, 'Tristan' is Wagner's finest masterpiece; not overbearing, but full of emotion and melodic beauty. With Karajan conducting, all these positives are brought to the forefront."
3,Stick with Bohm,"Three things make this an also ran: Karajan's self-indulgent conducting; the odd sonics; and, especially, Helga Dernesch. She's OK as vocalist - albeit a mite underpowered for the role - but the interpretation leaves me cold. The Isolde of Act I should be a proud Irish princess, resentful of her circumstances, and scornful of the Cornishmen who have the upper hand. Dernesch is just a damsel in distress.Vickers is an important artist and an acquired taste. He does very well with the hallucinations of Act III but he won't win any prizes for tonal allure. The supporting cast is quite good but Ludwig is heard to better advantage in the competing DGG set conducted by Bohm.Despite the rather luscious vocalism in Domingo's recent EMI effort, the forty year old DGG set is the one to get if you're only having one."
2,King of the Zombies Review,"This movie is a camp classic!!! It is so BAD that it is almost great. The premise is that Dick Purcell is working for the government and he and the always ridiculous Mantaan Moreland and John Archer crash their plane onto an Island inhabited by a Nazi sympathizer who turns the local natives into Zombies to do his evil bidding. The plot is confusing, how can a man help the Nazi cause by being on an island in the Bahamas? Mantaan Moreland, who was genuinely a funny man, is relegated in the role of the ""black servant"" who rolls his eyes, and by todays standards it is very sad that he was portrayed as an idiot. The movie however, is worth watching, simply to see the bad writing, directing, and the stereotypical portrayal of Nazis. It is truly a cult classic."
1,Poor Quality Transfer to DVD Format,"King Of The Zombies is a great campy/funny B&W film, and Mantan Moreland steals the show. Unfortunately this transfer of the film print to DVD is the worst that I have ever seen, and Im not referring to the scratches, dust or spots on the print that was used, this actually adds to the vintage feel of the film. The problem with this DVD is that the frame of view has been cropped in on all sides so any scene where the actors head is close to or at the edge of the original frame gets there head cut off down to the nose or mouth and this is through the whole film not one or two scenes. I don't recommend that anyone who enjoys vintage film of this type buy this DVD."
3,Zombie Film with Humor,"I thought the movie was entertaining and humorous. It was a typical zombie movie of the era (Caribbean Island with old house,and a sinster character controlling the zombies) with a plus--humor provided by Mantan Morland (he also starred in some Charlie Chan movies)."
2,not so good,"This book is very precious, and, this will sound bitchy, but if you look at the author's photo, he is in fact a goofy-looking guy who few men would want to look like. So his own appearance belies his own advice."
3,"works ok,",i had a calaender for the first year. It had places for picture not all the information. I would rather have the picture places. My first one came from hallmark. I really wish they made a second but this will do for what i need it to.
2,Where is the meat?,"First of all I went into this with a very open mind. I was expecting to hear some out of this world stuff but instead what I got was this lady talking about why she thinks her son is special for like 45 min and then the rest is taken up by her son saying he is not special, He did seem to be genuine but the mother has that annoying attitude many mothers display when talking about their kids. To be fair they do share some interesting info but its only like 5 min worth to me."
2,Abominable Production,"There are places where the quality of the recorded voice of the interview cannot easily be heard. It sounds like the interviewer used a real cheap cassette deck that had dirty heads, and in production a decision was made to cover the poor quality with cheesy D-Flat-Minor music, fading in so loud in parts that the speech is drowned out. As far as content, little or no substantiation is offered for their assertions. That said, I don't regret buying it. I'm happy to see any possible documentation of extra-dimensions, etc. But if your going to interview a person, for goodness sake, use at least a medium quality microphone!"
4,A tripy kid,"Ann Andrews wrote a book about her ""indigo son,"" who she firmly believes has been abducted numerous times by aliens and has tremendous psychic abilities. This DVD chronicles the story. It's a trip!"
1,weird,"Ok, I am into this stuff but, I have never seen a movie so poorly put together. It was mostly the mother talking about her son.Im not sure what her motive was except maybe to have few of her own 2 min. of fame??? I kept waiting for it to get better but, it did not. poor sound quality, poor picture quality. Very little content."
3,"expect rave rant, not hip hop","i dont know, sum of the music is fine, but the attempt to mic it like our heros just plain failed. less mic and more music, or better mcs i dont know, i respect the process, and think maybe live sum of the artist on this disc would be great, ill be lookin for em."
3,Good Wolf Book but Rather Biased,"I found the book intresting and informative, a good wolf book for general wildlife lovers. But I also found that some of the pages, like regarding hunting and conservation, leaked some proaganda and it made the book seem rather off. Instead of going into depth about the alaskan wolf control program, or the issue of wolf conservation in canada, the author seems to lightly touch on the subjects and take off agian. I was also slightly dispointed to read that Canada is only mentioned just a tiny bit in the whole book. The title clearly says US and Canada but focuses on american science that many biologists have already gone over numerous times. serious wolf people would add it to their collection but it doesn`t cover anything new."
2,Be Sure,"I got this for my husband as a gift bc he LOVES the team BUT after using it for only about 3 weeks the RB button started to stick and now just doesn't work. He was really upset and said ""you get what you pay for""."
5,excellent product,"Purchased this so I could use a Thule gutter mount rack on my 1986 Chevy Blazer, which is a 2 door and only has a short gutter over the doors. Used these on the rear roof section. Very well made, come with all attaching parts, rubber gaskets, inside reinforcement plates. Worked perfectly for my situation. Carry 2 kayaks on it."
4,Does the job,"Solid anchor - this is the second set I've installed on a fiberglass truck cap. Four stars because the supplied bolts were not long enough and for the price I'd like to see them include a small tube of silicone to use under the bolt heads.They're more than rugged enough to do the job reliably, and can be mounted on the top or the side of the cap."
4,Involving but not necessarily coherent storyline,"Sandilands accompanies Troop to the exotic palace of the Rajah of Ranipur, arriving just in time to investigate the murder of the rajah's son and get tangled in complicated palace politics.Just as complex as previous books and the society it is set in; I've enjoyed this series and Cleverly doesn't disappoint as Joe has to figure out not only whodunit and why, but who he can trust. Cleverly excels at evoking the atmosphere of Englishmen and women trying to copy with the mysterious East. The only major flaw is that Cleverly hides the evidence just a little too well; the ultimate solution left me with a ""huh?"" rather than an ""aha!"" feeling. However, the title was very relevant to the story."
2,Kari Wuhrer,"Was this a made-for-TV flick or a low budget indie? Anyway, the only reason I watched it was Kari Wuhrer (they're so smart to put her face on the DVD / video's cover). And I must say, that girl is a real feast to the eyes, whether you gotta see her skin or not (zippo in this case). So if you love Wuhrer, go watch her beautiful smile in this boring movie, and then if you're curious about her other assets, you can always rent or buy ""Luscious"" and ""Poison""."
4,Overcoming the Fear of the Potty,"My objective in purchasing this book for my two-year old daughter was to get her to overcome her fear of the potty, and to be more patient. Now she can sit and look at the book, while she sits on the potty.So far it is working quite well. The muppet theme helps!"
2,Book was dirty!,"I bought this item used crossing my fingers it would be ok. However, it was covered in food and other unidentifiable grossness so the minute I got it, I threw it in the trash. Only reason why it got two stars was because it arrived quickly."
3,A DECENT BOOK.,"A DECENT BOOK, IF YOUR CHILD LIKES MUPPETS THE BEST IS BYE BYE DIAPERS, BUT IT IS REALLY MORE FOR A GIRL. THE BOOK IS CUTE, NOT TO DIFFICULT TO UNDRESTAND, AND A GOOD PRICE. OUR VERSION IS HARD PAGES, SO IT IS REASONABLY STURDY."
3,"Good, but nothing for potty training","This book had nice characters and the story line was pretty good. However, I have to admit that no boy or girl will want to use the toilet after reading this book because there is nothing to catch his or her interest for potty training. It worked for us and then we gave it to our cousins when we were all potty trained. Try this and see if it potty trains your child."
4,Sun Ez-model basket,Basket works great.No instalation instructions sent or on website.Took 45 min to install with instructions it would have taken 10 min
3,No instructions,"While I eventually figured it out from the photo, it took far longer than it should have to install this onto my bike. How difficult would it have been to include one page with an exploded view of the installation?The basket rattles a bit, but that's a function of what it's mounted to, not the basket itself."
4,Grocery Getter,This basket fits nicely on my Ez 1 Recumbent bicycle. The only problem is no instructions. I called the merchant that shipped the basket to me and they refered me to the bicycle manufacturers website. On the website is a photo that you have to look over and try to figure out what goes where. No written instructions! I had extra nuts and screws left over but I did get it on the bicycle. I might add that I have a high mechanical aptitude and this wasn't easy for me.Once the basket is on it is really handy. I even shop for my groceries with the bicycle.
2,weak dream,"Not one of Mack's greater accomplishments. I love the artistry of his hand. The curves, the movement, the violence he displays with drawings. Real ink and paper. Towards the end of 'Dreams' he resorts to pictures of live blurry women and children's plastic dolls with Kabuki masks on black backgrounds. WHERE IS THE INK!? The real expression, not the highschool photography class. I pray his future expression is a little more from the heart and a little less from the lense."
4,Awesome Series!,"I remember watching this series as a kid, it was awesome then and it's awesome now. Watching this again, 24+ years later, I was realy surprised at what I was watching, it was so wierd. I was almost scared by their strange hollow eyes that seemed to follow me but not see me, and the strange way they spoke almost seems like they were doing a language experiment of some sort. I was really impressed with how puppets, models, and occasional footage of real people( a hand turning a knob, someone walking down an alley) and combined it with some real wierd dialog to make a facinating and enthralling series that really engages the imagination."
5,A must have album!,"The incredible playing of Maurice Andre fills up all two of these cds. From the incredible brandenberg reading to the Cimarosa. This album from start to finish is a text book on beauty, style, phrasing, and how to play the trumpet. Andre is a true master of the trumpet and even more a true master musician."
1,This does not fit,"I bought a pair of these. Only one works, but the other does not fit. When you tighten bolts, the tire does not rotate while the other rotor works fine.I could not return this because I tested these after 30 days so I cannot even return this broken item.DO NOT BUY THIS."
3,THe English Patient,"Wonderful and detailed story however a very,very long read. One of the few books you have to put down from time to time. I would not see the movie then read the book - read the bonk then see the movie in my opinion."
3,"Beautiful Writing, Very Little Plot","If you are looking for a book with a great plot and action of any kind look elsewhere. With that said, I didn't love this book, but I also didn't hate it. Ondaatje is clearly talented and his writing reflects that talent. However, this seemed to be more than ""a. . . web of dreams."" It seems to me to reveal a weakness in the author. After reading, I feel like he just sat down and wrote whatever came to his mind and in the beginning that was great. He established a beautiful yet tragic setting that ultimately reflected the characters interacting within. He also built characters that seemed very complex and for awhile everything seemed to be running smoothly. Then somewhere in the middle of the book everything became stagnant for quite a while, until the end where I felt like everything went crazy and the ending was ultimately rushed."
2,Ponderously slow and overblown--an unreal world of poetry,"I arrived with high expectations: this novel won the Booker no less, and I adored the movie. Unfortunately I disliked the book for the very reasons I loved the movie: it is an epic, poetic, sweeping vision of romance. For three hours on screen one can be carried away in this way. But for 300 pages? Ondaatje asks too much of us.The characters do not speak to one another or think, unless it is in the most meticulously floral language. There is not an inelegant passage in the book! Of course, there are many readers open to such a book, but others should steer clear of this long winded rumination on love and war."
4,Near Perfect,This novel is sensual and thrilling. The characters are so interwoven and intricate. It is a fairly quick read with a complex story. Even more fasinating are the allusions to history and art. Allusions that work themselves into the plot unlike anyother novel I have ever read.The only flaw in this novel (and it is a major one)is that the character of Kip (one of the most interesting characters) behaves out of character and more for the political protest of the author. This is the only reason why I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5 stars.
4,Poetically beautiful,"Ondaatje's prose is lyrical and poetic. More than anything, Ondaatje creates an atmoshpere that is as much a presence in this book than any single character. The story delves into the lives of four people living in a war-damaged Italian monastery as World War II ends. Hana, a nurse, attempts to nurse the English patient back to life. Caravaggio, Hana's childhood friend, and Kip, a skillful bomb difuser, make up the rest of the cast of characters. Beautifully and evocatively written but slow at times."
1,Couldn't even finish it.,"I found the book to be slow moving. I never felt a connection with any of the characters and, thus, didn't find the story worth finishing.If I didn't read a lot I'd have gotten a complex from my feelings towards this book. While everyone else is ranting about it, I found it a good cure for a couple nights of insomnia!"
2,pretentious,"English patient has some interesting characters and the plot does have some intrigue, but please, an astounding book? Not. Too many little-finger-in-the-air chardonnays for the book review set. The author's prose is like reading a college literature student's overdone ramblings, he tries way to hard to be artful with words, which is really an inconsideration to the reader. The author's ability to be creative should be secondary to his ability to communicate. A lot of the metaphors don't work, simply leaving you puzzled. This book is like going to dinner with people who can speak the same language as you, but decide they will talk in another, company be damned."
2,"Good movie, average book",This book has too many central characters each with her / his own separate story resulting in a disconnected patchwork of human tragedies. Taken together these tragedies sample the confusion following WW2 but fail to capture together anything revealing about humanity during such tormented times. The prose can be original and quirky but the author doesn't handle the language well enough yet to bring creative originality to the English language.
4,Beautiful Language & Haunting Characters,"I amazed by the amateur ""critics"" who have written reviews of this book. Did they fail to see the lyric language and full, beautiful characters? If every novel was written with immaculate historical content, it would be non-fiction; perhaps people should review the definitions of fiction and literature so that they might appreciate this book (and the author!) for the beauty and brilliance they capture."
3,Or maybe 2 and three quarters...,"I pretty much liked this book - it was better than some I've read - and, as we all know, the dude has his style down pat, all poetry and dreaminess, a sense of the story floating around and through you, like some mist, or a fog. But it doesn't really grab you; it meanders here and there, exploring different characters, different back stories, different tangents, but without following any one of them to a satisfying conclusion. The one meaty, suspenseful issue - the matter of the English patient's identity - is built up to for some time, but then brushed off with hardly a passing thought. It would have been nice to have been hooked, to have had something hit home, rather than have it always swooning about you, looking pretty but not really meaning anything. Still, it did earn the dude a chunk of money and fame; he won't be wanting for work again!Now tell me - does he have sex with her after she's dead? I rather think he might..."
3,Intriguing but undisciplined,"A story that pulls you in gently and captivates but whose ending trails off a bit unpurposefully. Well-crafted writing, lovely to read, and definitely worth reading -- it's just that upon finishing it you may be left feeling that something necessary has been left undone."
2,"Pretentious ""literature""","I firmly believe that the purpose in writing is to convey information to others. Mr. Ondaatje seems to have a more obscure purpose. I found this book unclear, self-consciously arty, and populated with pointlessly enigmatic characters. I might have enjoyed the annotated Herodotus, so often referred to, but never presented. The diary of a man in love with the desert would surely have been more engaging and direct than the elliptical, pointless, yet painful relationships we have been shown"
1,"After seeing the movie, this book was a major disappointment","This book was a rambling mess. It was a crime for the Academy not to give Anthony Minghella an Oscar for his adapted screenplay-he turned this terrible work of literature into one of the best movies ever made. See the movie, DON'T read the book"
5,Marvelously Intoxicating!,"As a high school student reading this book for an assignment, I was not expecting to be entertained by any means. However, I enjoyed this fantastic novel. The complex web of mystery surrounding the charcters was gripping. Reading the sensuous discriptive passages was more like reading a wonderful poem instead of reading a novel. This splendid novel is definitely worth the read"
4,Captivating!,"It's rare that I read an original novel AFTER seeing the movie first, but, once I saw the film version of ""The English Patient,"" I wanted to read the novel itself because if the movie was as good as it was, the novel had to be just as good (if not better). I was definitely not disappointed. This is one of the most beautifully descriptive novels I have ever read. The author's choice of words is exquisite, and he conveys the images in his novel perfectly. Had I NOT seen the movie before reading the novel, I could have gotten just as good a visual from just reading Ondaatje's words on the page. This is the only novel by Ondaatje that I've read, but I'm anxious to read some of his other works."
4,The Best of Both Worlds,"I saw the movie first and fell in love with the story. All too often film adaptations are a betrayal of an author's splendid story-telling. Anthony Minghella is a rare talent in the film industry who does not allow his ego to get in the way of Michael Ondaatje's good story. Anyone who saw the movie will love the book for its added insight and detail. Anyone who read the book will love the movie for its splendid visual adaptation. The reader and the viewer enjoy the best of both worlds.My only criticism of the book is that the poet occasionally got in the way of the novelist. Several times, I found myself having to reread dialogue to figure out who was saying what to whom."
3,The story got lost in the words,"Ondaatje's style is very wordy, and the plot gets somewhat lost in the description. The plot is somewhat entertaining and did keep us somewhat intrigued. The only good part about the wordiness was that it conveyed many definite beautiful images of far off lands. Sometimes, the plot wasn't expressed clearly enough, and we didn't realize that certain things had taken place until we saw the movie."
2,Eccentric Prose destroyed by intertwining mess of a plot,I read 132 pages into the novel confused as hell. I then rented the movie and cleared up a lot of confusion as to where Ondaatje was trying to lead the reader. His beautifully eccentric poetic style of writing was deeply effected by the intertwining mess of a plot. After finishing the movie the novel became much more understanding and beautiful.
5,"The English Patient, even better in print than on the screen","The English Patient by Micheal Ondaatje should be savored. Its words, its phrasing is poetic and profound. Very different from the movie, quite unique in perspective, this book offers mental bonbons that can be devoured quickly or rationed for weeks. Many of the phrases that sounded awkward on screen become delicious in print. The interplay between the characters and even the plot twists carry new weight when read. It is a story of beauty appreciated and love that just misses out, of bad decisions that lead to the wonderous moments of life that we would never have avoided no matter what the cost. Ondaatje's work ranks with Milan Kundera in its sheer beauty and ""rightness"". My first introduction to his work, The English Patient will not be my last. Now I plan to order and feast on his other offerings"
5,Absolutely the best,"Yesterday I finished ""The English Patient"" crying. Each page contains a gift like finding a $20 in your jacket pocket or a winning lottery ticket in a parking lot. Each page is an invitation to take a trip, write a letter, make a wish. I dreamed every night of sand, making love near an ocean, trapped in the airplane under the sand, cold, heat. I breathe sand at night, wake up feeling gritty. I started noticing the colors of people--at work, on the street. Pale men, dark men, dark women, smooth and rough and covered in sand. I eat olives, peel plums, lay in the dark on my back in the library and weep. And then I read ""Coming Through Slaughter"" and lost my mind further to the beauty of Ondaatje's voice"
5,"Sea-horse metaphor aside, a staggering novel","This novel is (forgive me for a regrettably trite analogy), like rich chocolate cake. It can either be devoured with a fiery voracity or savoured for its intricate nuances, and, in fact, should be read in both ways. The extremely complex and suggestive web of motifs present in Ondaatje's masterful work makes this novel tasty and satisfying the second and even third time through. I have heard it criticized for excessive sentimentality and romanticism, but that is exactly what is needed in response to the desolate emotional wasteland of a post-war world. Additionally, the end of the novel, I think, might disabuse many cold cynics of such notions. In any case, a striking, artistic masterpiece that would be a disgrace to overlook."
5,simply beautiful and rich,"Ondaatje's writing is sparse and moving. I can't say whether the history is correct, I don't think that was the point. Another reviewer fussed about the character's unlikely political allegances, again, I don't think that was the point. The story is about the unpredicatble, powerful forces of love in an uncertain and turbulant time."
2,"For the first time, the film's better than the book","For those of you who think that films based on books don't usually do them justice, here's an exception: while the film based on this book is perceptive, poetic and touching, the book is overly descriptive, confusing and boring. See the film; forget about the book."
2,Read the summary,"I thought this was going to be a great book to read but as I started it ,I was greatly disappointed because it is extremely boring. The author has added in so much unnecessary detail and boring descriptions as well as characters of no significance. However to be fair, the book starts picking up pace towards the middle with the descriptions of the desert trips that I really enjoyed. Parts of the plot are loosely connected for instance the change of Hanna's feelings from her love to the English Patient to the sapper. Also the attitude of the sapper after the Hiroshema bomb. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,"well, maybe I should try it again","It has been a long, long time since I didn't finish a book. The ramblings and looseness of plot did not hold my attention long enough to finish this book. After reading other reviews, maybe I should try it on a better day. After 200 pages, I gave up"
3,Not as involving as the film,"Though it is a literary masterpiece, this novel is somewhat disconcerting and hard to follow at times. The plot is unprecedented, but it is hard to be pulled into the character's lives."
3,"I didn't care about the characters, but beautiful images.","I read this book because I was disapointed in the movie. The underlying plot of love, adultery and quests in the dessert called to my heart and I longed to read the ""real story"".What I found was the movie represented the book - for once- at its downfall. In order to have a ""vilian"" as the main character, the reader must connent with him. I did not. I wanted to, I wanted to see one redeaming quality revealed. I searched a searched to be only dissapointed.The images are beautiful, the writing poetic and inticing. One can smell dry air and taist the sand in one's teeth. But the characters are 2-dimentional, emotionally flat and did not ""captive the soul"". This is not a book that kept me awake at night, mulling over details.I recommend The English Patient overall, it is worth the read. Don't expect to gain intimacy with the characters."
1,REALLY!,Purple prose does not translate into either literature or poetry. This is the only book that actually made me physically ill. I could say a lot more but that would only be giving this book free advertising and that is something I definitely do NOT want to do!
1,I wish to give it no stars at all. Such a BORE!,After all the great reviews that this book received I had high expectations when I began reading it. It wasn't long before I was greatly disappointed.I soon discovered what a boring book it is. I just couldn't bring myself to finish it.This is probably one of the few stories that make better movies than books.
2,Watch the Movie and Don't Read the Book... Trust Me!,I started this book with great expectations only to be greatly dissapointed! I fell asleep reading this book repeatedly.
2,This is what gets awards in Hollywood?,"I began this book with a very open mind thinking that since it was given such grand reviews I would like it. WRONG! I kept reading thinking it would get better. When I finished it I thought, SO? I could not see how this could be made into one of the great love stories of the century. The characters were not fully developed, but I continued to read thinking I would eventually come to the great love story and I would become excited about the plot. It never came. The narrative by the English patient did not tell me of any great love. Just a fling behind the husband's back. I was very disappointed by this book"
2,Snooty prose attracts devotees,"While most are raving over this novel, here's another ""thumbs down."" Ondaatje gives little life to his characters -- but mostly relies on descriptions of their surroundings to convey their thoughts and emotions. Very well, it's been done before with great success. But the problem here is that Ondaatje is obviously too in love with his own prose.Reading this book is sort of like being lectured to by a snooty english prof. who thinks he's got a better handle on setting symbolism than you ever will. Oh well, folks seem to love it anyway. Go figure."
1,"Oh, For Goodness Sake!","It's quite obvious from the tone of the book that the only character this author cares about is himself! Soooo tedious that every time I sat down to read, I found myself thinking about watering my tomato plants, which would have been a LOT more interesting. I could write more, but that would just give this book free advertising, which is something I DEFINITELY DON'T want to do."
4,"A powerful,lyrical, and intelligent war-time romance.","I have just started to read The English Patient for the fourth time and I am still enthralled by the incredible beauty of the language. This novel was clearly written by a poet,who leaves with you multi-layered, powerful memories of the allure of the desert, the obsessiveness of the love affair, the characters' sad longing for everything they've lost and can never recover. Except for a few tedious passages about bomb defusion, this is one of the most intelligently romantic (not sentimental) novels of the late 20th century. The images stay with you--the cave of swimmers, the hunted monastery, the desert winds--as much as the well delineated characters, making you want to come back again and again to their distant and magical world. The novel holds you in its lyrical grip and you won't want to let go."
5,An epic that sweeps through you like the winds of the desert,"Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient is a lyrical journey into the hearts and souls of four characters in World War II North Africa. His words take hold of your mind and lead you through to the very end, leaving you exhausted when the characters are exhausted and overjoyed when the characters are overjoyed. This is a must read for anyone who has read In The Skin Of A Lion."
4,Well Written!,"This novel, written in extremely beautiful prose, is one of the most fascinating that I have ever read. It can only be described as dreamlike. It certainly deserved the Booker Prize."
