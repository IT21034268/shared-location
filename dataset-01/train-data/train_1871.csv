1,Hippy Dippy And Uninteresting,Ugh. I got this book expecting to read about a courageous young girl and what I got was just a boring account on how sugary sweet and hippy dippy she was. Somehow I don't think the real Joan Of Arc was as disgustingly coy and naive as Mr. Twain has portrayed her. The book dragged on and on. It was also very uninteresting and I would have gotten more entertainment out of reading my neighbor's grocery list.
3,"Atypical Twain, but interesting nonetheless","This is not your typical Mark Twain. It is not a funny book, but rather a history. Drawn from the testimony from the trial of Joan of Arc, it presents a portrait of Joan from childhood until her death, focusing mostly on her military campaign and trial. Told from the perspective of her secretary and page, it is nonetheless a brilliant piece of work, full of wry observations. Although Twain was not religious, the book is full of religion and mysticism; this can be excused, of course, since it is supposed to be told from the perspective of a frenchman of the time. Although not inherently funny, it is a good way to become acquainted with the life and works of Joan of Arc, much less dry than a straight history would be."
2,Something different from Twain.,"Presents some interesting historic atmospherics and insights, but is too tedious in style and detail. Surprising subject from Twain may make it worth a look."
1,Ridiculous conclusion to a lightweight book.,"Morrow concludes that hope is the opposite of evil in this unsuccessful work. Hope! As if Adolf Hitler, Osama bid Ladin, Nero, Senator Joseph McCarthy, Jim Jones, various American Presidents, etc. didn't have high hopes for their nasty agendas.Hope! Hope is all too often a willing ally of evil. Why read this trash when you could read Schopenhauer or Hume instead?"
5,The Jewish New Testament,This an excellent book for those who wish to study and research how the Jews directly transcribe the New Testament into English!!!
2,Disappointed,I was glad to see the names corrected back to the original Hebrew but was very disappointed to see the same mistranslations and additions from the catholic translations still included. I would not recommend this translation to another.
2,Jewish How?,"While this translation of the New Testament pretends to be a Jewish New Testament nothing could be further from the truth. David Stern simply inserted the tradition Hebrew words for various Jewish cultural events (Pesach for Passover...), reinserted the Jewish names of the disciples and other individuals mentioned, but in fact this is a very Baptist translation of the New Testament. I would recommend ""A Jewish Annotated New Testament"" if you really want a truly Jewish perspective on the New Testament."
1,Misleading There is no 'Jewish' New Testament,"This review is not meant to offend Christians and believers in the New Testament.However it is dishonest to speak of a 'Jewish New Testament'.Why, because there is no Jewish 'New Testament' Jews have had to go through generations of persecution, efforts to force to convert us to Christianity. We constitute a small percentage of the people of the world, less than two - tenths of one percent. One out of every three human beings on earth is a Christian.'Judaism is based on what Christians called the Old Testament plus the Oral Torah, the Mishna and the Gemara. The 'New Testament' has no place in Jewish worship.The attempt therefore by someone of Jewish origin who has converted to Christianity to represent this as authentic Jewish text is dishonest."
1,The 'New Testament' is a Christian Book (Duh),Thats why I recommend instead (to Jewish readers)V'Da Mah SheTashiv: Know What To Answer (To Missionaries) A Thorough Jewish response To Missionaries
3,Typical,"This was one of thirty NT versions I used as part of my research on ""The Influence of Trinitarian Doctrine on Translations of the Bible"". It was typical of most Christian translations; that is, it often, if not always, mistranslated the original writers' pronouns(and other words)related to the Spirit as ""he"" instead of ""it"". The NT writers never once used ""he"" or ""who"" when referring to the spirit of God, but the influence of the Triniatrian faith is of such power that Christian translators regularly succumb to the temptation to mistranslate the original words in order to make it appear that the NT writers were Trinitarians. To order copies of my reseach, go to [...] and write for info."
5,Excellent dynamic equivalent!,"This is Dr. Stern's own translation of the UBS 3rd edition Greek text into a dynamic equivalent English text, which is sensitive to Jewish (and Yiddish!) expressions and culture. It expresses a unique theological apologetic of modern Messianic Jewish concerns and is an attempt to combat classical Christian translations of Paul's unique theological creations such as ""[h]upo nomon"" which expresses the unbeliever's relation to the Torah. I highly recommend this excellent edition and even his final ""Complete Jewish Bible."""
5,Historical--and spiritually moving!,"I just loved this book! It was not only an interesting history lesson, but one of the most spiritually-inspiring books I've ever read. I am planning to get ""That Printer of Udell's"" to satisfy my curiousity about this book that had such a profound effect of Reagan's childhood. I'm also interested in reading Whittaker Chamber's ""Witness."" Wow--one good book just leads to others! Anyway, ""God and Ronald Reagan"" is an amazing book that I highly recommend to anyone. (I'm under thirty, and I loved it, so I hope other young people will as well.)"
2,Not that interesting,"Hmm a book on Ronald Reagan's spiritual side. Maybe I was hoping against hope that it would not start with the premise that Ronnie was this Centuries greatest President, no such luck with this master piece. We all know the strengths of the great man but with this book we get to look at them all over again in a religious light, I wasn't impressed with the tone or insights of the book (there aren't any apart from what you've already read in the other reviews). Maybe as I'm not a great fan of Ron it was never going to be too interesting but I expected something more than what I got, which was well researched, reasonably well written and non-offensive to those of a more left wing persuasion, but still rates as one of the tamest most sycophantic books I have ever read. Give it a miss and read Gorbachev's autobiography, now thats what I call gripping."
4,Corvette 50th,This is a very nice book who want lots of facts pertaining to Vettes from 1953 thru 2004. Tons of good full color pictures. Worth owning and makes a great coffee table book.
3,Not Durable,"I ordered four of these as a gift, they looked nice, but by the time my friend got them one had started to disintegrate! The weave came unglued from the frame at the top and at the back, and the actual fabric began to unravel. VERY disappointed, but I guess they WERE cheap compared to other similar items online."
1,Too much of a bother,I have to install the disk and change my color settings everytime I want to play. Thats too much of a bother for me so I don't play it. Read -- don't waste your money.
3,YOU'RE DEAD WITHOUT MONEY,"CRACKING THE BIG TIME WAS GOING TO BE A CINCH Joey Luck and his beautiful daughter were ace shoplifters and pickpockets. But Cindy has bigger ideas. When they were joined by Vin Pinna, expert thief and thug on the run from Miami, prospects improved, but kidnapping ex-movie star Don Elliot wasn't such a good idea; until he made the trio a quartet in crime. The crime? Stealing stamps worth a million dollars. And the route to the stamps was Judy Larrimore, nympho daughter of their owner. She was just Vin's style... A COLLECTOR ITEM AND I AM A COLLECTOR OF JAMES HADLEY CHASE, THE KING."
5,An Honorable Woman,I really liked this book. The characters of Cam and Gus are well defined and believable. The minor characters are hilarious. The touch of humor that they give is a relief from all the serious of Lindsay's other books. The book is well written and the plot flows along and answers the question of how will Cam face her future after leaving Maya in Heart of Stone. She completes the mission and realizes that no mission is ever flawless. The romance is really great. I would encourage everyone to pick up a copy. This is a good book whether or not you have read any of her previous books. Definatly a keeper.
3,Old-fashioned lace,"Barbara Abbet's ""Knitted Lace"" is a worthwhile collection of mostly lace edgings and insertions, with a few patterns. Instructions are given in line-by-line written format, with no charts, my major quibble with the work. Otherwise, a good reference book."
3,"Strange knitting notation, for those who love a puzzle.","I wanted a stitch dictionary that focused on lace edgings. This one does, but reading the patterns is more work that it is worth, at least for me. I don't insist on charted designs - good old knitter's English is good enough for me - if I want a chart, I can make my own.But these patterns are notated in the author's own unique shorthand. BEWARE! You will spend a good portion of your time deciphering them, flipping back and forth to the abbreviation chart, and basically wasting time you could have used for actual knitting.If you want to learn to knit from her system, go for it! It isn't difficult, just tedious. If you do, this book will be a treasure for your library.I think the black and white photos are fine. It is the notation that lost points in my opinion. I am not sure I'll keep it."
4,Buyer opinion,"Excellent content, but the book was made from photocopies of an old one. At this price, one supponse the author should improve the quality inside the book."
5,It's a very touchy movie.,"When I saw the movie I knew from the very start that it was a sad story,by the way it was potrayed to the viewers.Personally I feel Leo and Kate make a perfect match,I wouldn't mind at all if James Cameron were to ask them to star in another movie along side."
4,Good reference book or RPG IV,Good book for reference purpose for intermediate to advance programmers - alphabetically arranged all RPG code + more. Not recommended for learners. And a little expensive.
4,A book that is worth the price.,This book is very easy to read as the layout is very structured. It is a good reference book for RPG programmers.
4,The Modern RPG IV Language Second Edition Thank you Cozzi,I finally have a reference that is basically everything from v3r1 to v4r4 for RPG IV. Time to burn my first edition dating back to 1996. Thanks Robert Cozzi for something that was overdue!!!!
2,"Heavy on Atmospherics, Light on Understanding","Having lived on Negros for a couple of years, I think that Berlow didn't understand much of what may have really been going on in the incident he describes. The provinces are very different from Manila. I got more of a sense of the author's dread and foreboding than much insight into what really happened, or into the cultural, political and economic background to the murders.James Hamilton-Paterson writes much more insightful books about the Philippines."
1,A Good Fiction writer,"The book is a great work of fiction. Let it be known that Berlow most probably did not spend so much time researching.I hail from Negros Occidental and know the Gatuslaos (the family he constantly lambasts) very well. It is quite unfair that the author continuously makes up stories about incidents that never happened and describes people very wrongly. All, while he portrays everything to be factual as he promotes a very communistic and radical ideology."
2,Inaccurate and irresponsible,"Alan Berlow is a good writer, he is detailed and you can easily picture yourself in the locations he describes. I think he can be a very good fiction writer, which is essentially what Dead Season is. I am a Philippine resident and I have read similiar accounts of the events Berlow mentioned. Yes, there are cover ups and the usual government corruption, but what I think was foul was his irresponsible descriptions of some people, which brings no value, except picture Berlow as a racist."
3,Missing Catherine,"I'm a huge fan of the Catherine LeVendeur mysteries series but had a hard time getting into this one. Since this one focused on Solomon however I found myself a bit bored with the story. Solomon is just not as interesting a character as Catherine, and does not have enough charisma to carry an entire story.The story line and research are still well done, and as a whole, this is a good book of historical fiction."
2,Could not get into this book.,In the past I have always enjoy her early books. Now they seem to be gettng repetitive and real downers.
3,Not as enjoyable as others in this series,"I was looking forward to this book because I love the Catherine LeVendeur series, and Solomon is a particular favourite of mine. This book features Solomon, and Catherine does not appear. Solomon finds himself travelling with an odd mixture of people. Both Jews like himself and Christians, as well as two priests. To add to the confusion for Solomon, his hated father and his most hated enemy are part of the group. This definitely causes him some troubles because he doesn't know where he is or where he belongs, and people keep getting murdered in their party. I found the book moved a little slow, and had a bit of difficulty getting through it."
3,Bad Idea,Placido Domingo has one of the greatest voices of all time. I love to hear him sing. For that reason I gave this 3 stars. His singing is good even if the songs are ordinary and I think several are reworks of previous material. I admit I'm not familiar with spanish music so for me much of this sounds alike but worth listening to. As for the DVD-please do Mr. Domingo a favor and don't watch it. It is embarrassing to see such a great artist sink to such a low level. The lip-synching is obvious and the performances terrible. Leave the low-brow stuff to Julio Iglesias and Luciano Pavarotti. They are better at it. This CD/DVD is worth listening to but not watching.
3,KRS-One Life is good and interesting.,"KRS One: Life ***KRS-One life is a good album from the teacher, who's always made some good things and this is one, Although there are some flaws here, but the album is very good, I'm gonna give this a marginal thumbs up."
5,Rudresh the magician,Thats what he is as he weaves dark colors into an amazing texture of soundscape Rudresh is the ultimate alto saxophone today standing high and tall taking the music to a new level
4,Dead Even,"Mariah Stewart always makes for an interesting read. She makes the improbablebelievable. 3 prisoners meet in jail & play a game of how they would killsomeone for the others. Not knowing the victims, the killer would not besuspected. 1 of the men thinks it's a game, but he finds out different andmust carry out his deadly bargain. I've read a few of her books & liked allof them."
3,the heart of the game,"The Heart of the GameThe movie looked better on t v it was ok , more like a doc."
5,Teamwork leads to success,"The Roosvelt High School girls basketball team overcame many adversities through a a united effort by the young women, the coach and parents and the school to demonstrate that underdogs can win."
5,All Net,"A superb sports documentary with multiple foci.... a unique coach, girls athletics, race relations, class clashes. Very well done and thoroughly enjoyed by my coaches and students. Tells it with impeccable truth through the lens of reality. Watch it, Enjoy it and share it with folks who love athletics."
4,"Art, Miami",I caught the last half of this documentary on cable and was immediately mesmerized. It's a wonderful story of persistence and the fact that it plays out over a six year period makes it all that more fascinating.
4,"Overall Good Mic, has some drawbacks","I got this mic for use with the Samson Zoom H4Zoom H4 Handy RecorderThis mic is good in terms of its audio pickup, the sound is crisp, and its excellent for portable recording due to the short(er) length of its wire. although, if using it with something like a zoom, the xlr adapter can be bulky.the only drawback so far is that it came with 2 windscreens (mesh and foam), and i put the mesh one on and now i can't take it off. i guess its not that big a deal, it's hard to find a cardioid/condenser mic of this nature at this price. next step up on the mic chart would be a lot closer to 100-200 dollars."
2,Sizing runs small,Sizing was very small. Order a size up from your normal size. More like a sweatshirt type pant. Not for office work.
3,Pricey for the quality,"I had to return the product and size it up. The lady was nice and resent the product quickly. The pants are not consistently sewn, The taper and length vary even tho I bought the same size - the black were smaller than the beige."
5,Blast from the past,"The game was just as I remember playing as an adolescent. Still kinda creepy as ever. If you're a big retro gamer, this game is an absolute must."
2,"Really dated graphics, but then it's really old!","Love the ZORK world. Have all of them and have played them. Like the sense of humor, love the puns. Remarkably, the text games actually stand the test of time better than Return to Zork with its clumbsy graphics and awkward play. Sometimes it's better to use one's imagination than to see and be disappointed. The story's still good, tho'"
3,Not a bad read...but not too scary,"I did enjoy this book. However, I think that it would have been better if written in the first person. Written in third party, it seems a little too fictional - difficult to believe that it is a true story. If you want an entertaining read - go ahead and try it. If you're looking for a frighteningly real, true story- you might want to look elsewhere."
4,Not bad for the price,"It's not easy to get polarized-lens sunglasses for a decent price, let alone 2 sets of lenses (one polarized set, and a normal set). These glasses are decent, although a little heavy for plastic frames. My only other criticisms are that the rubber nose pieces are a little uncomfortable when first put on (these should be removable, just like the lenses)and the word ""polarized"" on the sandstone lenses is a little large and is not removable. Overall, a good value for the money."
3,"Protective, but not a perfect fit","Close, but not a proper fit. When putting the hard case on over the rubber sleeve, it's difficult to get it lined up with the button covers on the sides (power button and volume rocker have a rubber button cover that fit into slots on the sides of the hard case). The 3-pin pogo connector isn't lined up with the opening on the case. Other than that, seems like a durable and protective case."
1,poor quality,"not worth the money. After being worn a while changed colors and then it broke. I don't have it anymore, threw it away.Waste of your money"
2,Not what I expected at all,"I was looking for some new bulbs so I can have a really bright light and I since the description is xtreme white plus, I figured I go with these. After installing these in my car there was no difference at all in brightness. I was expecting to at least being able to see the difference. These are more like a replacement bulb than anything."
5,Lights up the world!,"While I got prob 15K miles.. ""don't run lights at day"" the payoff is phenominal and no comparison.Its fun to be on a freeway and have traffic behind you and light up the whole world in front of everybody!When your in the city and hit high beams, you will see every sign for miles.... if it will reflect you ""will"" see it... signs are almost blinding up close.As my eyes get older, I love having tons and tons of light."
4,"Nice lights, but no obvious difference","I've put PIAA lights on four or five of my past vehicles and have generally been impressed with their light output. This is the second pair of Xtreme Whites that I've used ('13 Ford Explorer, '10 Ford Super Duty) and while the light is definitely whiter and ""cleaner"", I haven't noticed a difference in how well the streets are lit. Either Ford uses a high-quality stock bulb, or the PIAA difference is too small to see in normal conditions.I will say I like the white light better, which is the primary reason why I purchased the PIAA bulbs again. I sat at a stop light one dark morning directly across from a police officer (both of us in opposing left-turn lanes, so we were facing directly at each other). Knowing the cops around here, if the light was too bright he'd have let me know one way or another. As it was, he went on his way."
3,"PIAA quality... but definitely not ""Xtreme White""",Fit and finish is definitely there as PIAA is usually known for. Never had a problem with fitment like those generic China-made ones. Was a bit dissapointed that it wasn't as white as I was hoping. My daytime running lights still look like the same yellow as the stock bulbs.
2,PIAA highbeam headlights for Chevy truck,"I was using stock bulbs and switched to the PIAA from a friends recommendation. Honestly Iam not impressed by the PIAA performance, looks exactly the same as the stock bulbs, no blue/white color and same brightness. Save your money and stay with the stock bulbs..."
3,Great but needs audio tools,"This textbook is very informative. However, I'm an audio learner, rather than one who learns by reading. It's really too bad the don't have textbook tools to go along with all of theses. It would be a tremendous help for me."
2,"Good Series, Strong Build Up, Bad Ending","I really loved this series. Everything lead to Fuma and Kamui in a final comfrontation. What I thought would happen, was at least our hero finally awakening to his true power. Instead we get some kind of love conquers the day event, which leave me feeling like I was cheated of a real good fight. It's the only reason I rate the series so low. To go through the series, and to get that little of a payoff is not good to me."
1,SHOCKED & OFFENDED,"If you want your child listening to inappropriate & offensive lyrics ... this toy is for you! My daughter received this cassette player for her 3rd birthday ... and as the family, young & old, gathered around to listen to music, we were shocked to hear Outkast singing about sex and another group singing about teenage boy fantasies. I am appalled. This toy is going back to the store AND I am filing a complaint with SPECTRA (the maker of this toy). It's a crime that this toy company is marketing sex to preschoolers. Here's a thought for Spectra toy makers - how about selling and marketing a SSC toy with SSC songs?! Proceed with caution!"
1,Appalled and Song Artist and Lyrics,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is totally inappropriate music for any toddler, child, teenager or young adult. I am shocked that Toys R Us would sell such a product that includes obscene lyrics to young children. The manuacturer needs to recall all the products immediately and replace the cassette tape. Otherwise, my 3 year olds loves the idea of singing along with another tape of her favorite songs and getting the family to join in with her. If it wasn't for the cassette of obscene lyrics, I'd give this a higher rating."
3,Disappointed,"My 3 year old daughter got this sing along cassette player this year for her birthday in June 2006. She was SO excited when she opened it and the overall appearance is really cute~~ When you turn the product on, it is hard to hear your child's voice over the top of the music if she wants to sing along with the cassette tapes because the volume does not go very loud at all!! The only way to really hear your voice coming out of this machine is if you have no background noise and are singing into it with just the microphone alone. And that isn't much fun for most little girls. When the cassette player just sits (on), it makes a loud buzzing noise as well. As a side note: The headset it comes with is flimsy, and not durable. The twin brother (also 3) broke it by merely accidentally stepping on it."
1,Believe me I owned this toy!,"I bought this toy for my daughter a while ago. I thaught it was cute, but the songs on the cassettes are inappropriate for young children. That aside, the problem I had with this toy is that after about 8 months of use (which wasn't that much) it seemed to have died out. It wouldn't play any music, just made a horrid noise. I did everything I could to fix it, but no luck. Please take my advice, save your money."
4,Birthday gift,"I just received this as a birthday gift from my husband. We were very active in our local gym until our son was born a couple of years ago. And, like most parents, we ""lost"" the time to work out. But, we figured out that if we had equipment at home, we could get back into shape. We've had an elliptical machine for a year now, and just recently added the Empower bench. I really like. It is compact, and (my husband says) it was relatively easy to assemble. So far here are my only complaints: it needs another ankle strap so that you don't have to completely remove it from one foot to another between sets; also, the strap that holds the bench up during standing exercises is a little loose. You are instructed to hold onto it for balance, and because the strap is loose the bench can still move quite a bit. Other than that, I think this is a very good, reasonabley priced piece of equipement for Mom's on the go......"
5,Outstanding !!!,"This home gym was the best purchase I have ever made. It is compact so it doesn't take up much room in my home and even when it is not folded up, it's sleek look makes it an eye catcher not an eye sore. Never mind that it is a system that does a complete body workout, BUT it comes with this GREAT WORKOUT DVD. I highly recommend this home gym to all women. Check out their webiste at www.fitnessem.com to see the other great products they sell."
2,no assembly directions!!! and impossile to reach manufacturer,can't use it if I can't put it together and I'm not experienced enough to do it without assembly directions. can't get in touch with the manufacturer either to arrange to have directions mailed to me. VERY FRUSTRATING!!
2,Broke quickly.,"I loved this toaster when I bought it -- it's a gorgeous color and looks great in my kitchen. And it's an Oster, which I thought was a trustworthy brand. I bought it in December, and after about five months we noticed it began to toast unevenly. One side of the bread would be toasted to perfection and the other side would still be soft. I got to looking inside of it as it was toasting and noticed that, while all of the heating elements in the middle of the toaster worked, the ones on the outsides were almost completely dark. Which explained the uneven toasting. So, two stars because it's a sharp-looking toaster, and because while it worked it worked fine, but crapped out after only a few months."
1,Lever now won't stay down...after 4 toast cycles...,"I don't think I broke the darn thing, but after 4 toast cycles..in like 5 days now...the lever will no longer keep the toast down, and the button LEDs no longer light. Only way to get toast is to hold the lever down and stand there. Only good thing I guess, is that the chances of burning toast are now kept to a minimum...a problem some other reviewers seem to have :-\ Plus, I threw out all the packaging, so no returning to store it looks like."
5,The Big Red One-Two Slice Toaster,Fast shipping/delivery. Great toaster. This unit was a replacement item and is just perfect. Would recommend if you are in need of a red appliance.
5,toaster,"I have never used an oster product before and this is a definitely a recommendation for all my friends it works great and I enjoy the color, compliments my kitched really well"
1,Pretty but broke on third use.,"This toaster is very nicely styled and seems to be well designed. However on the 3rd use, only two of he four elements heated up, thus toasting only one side of the bread. Needless to say it was returned, and I'm trying a different brand."
1,Already broken!,"Bought this toaster less than two months ago and it's already broken. The control buttons (one of the reasons why we bought it) are not functioning, neither is the darkness control knob. Once it's put into the toast position, it does not shut off, you have to push up the lever manually. My son put in some Toaster Swirls only to set off the smoke alarm. This is the second time a product (a rice cooker)from this brand has broken within months of purchase. I'm just going to avoid Oster at all costs in the future."
1,Buy at your own risk !!,"The Amazon reviews are mixed, and for good reason. Mine arrived with a couple small scratches in the otherwise very cool candy-apple red surface. Oh well. But the really bad news was yet to come. After doing the suggested burn-in (one cycle with no bread - and yep, there really is a noxious odor from that), I set the darkness control to about 4.5 (ranges from 1 to 7). Burnt, completely burnt. So I set it down to 3.5. Burnt again. 2.5 - barely brown. 3 - burnt. And, as other reviews note, it doesn't toast evenly on both sides. One reviewer thought that was great; I think it sucks. I guess Oster is owned by Sunbeam, and who knows who owns them, but these products that are thrown together in China or elsewhere where they pay $.02/hr for labor can hardly be expected to be reliable, can they? Aint the global economy f'in' wonderful?!"
1,Didn't last 6 months,"This was chosen for my mother-in law because of the color. It still heats, but doesn""t control the toasting time. Pop-up toaster have worked well for 50+ years. Adding electronics was a bad idea."
2,It worked well until...,"I was pretty happy with this when I first bought it--toasted bread well, and the bagel setting worked well. After about 3 weeks, the blasted slice tray would no longer stay down. I'm looking for something a little sturdier."
1,tray won't stay down,"Don't waste your money!! After about 6 months the blasted tray won't stay down!! What a bummer, because it matched my coffee maker and blender."
2,stopped working,Had the toaster for 5 months and it stopped working. The tray keeps popping back up. What happened to toasters that lasted 20 years?
5,Great Good Looking Toaster!!!,"Looks sweet and works just as you would like, you can't go wrong with this cute, brave little toaster. Good number of settings, not too big and not too small, fits in great with a granite kitchen counter top!"
5,Oster Toaster,We went from a toaster oven with poor toasting abilities to this Dream machine. Not only is it beautiful in the candy apple red color but it out peforms any toaster made past the 1960's. We love it.
5,"Oster 6307 Inspire 2-Slice Toaster, Red",The toaster was a perfect addition to my adoptive daughter new home where her kitchen is black and red. She likes the 2 toaster since she is the only one who lives there. She loves the color and it blends with her plates and other kitchen stuff.
1,Buyer Beware!,I purchased the Oster 6307 several months ago and I'm already having issues with it. It toasts unevenly so I have to put the bread in twice to get it to toast on both sides. I thought I was buying a reliable product.
2,"Great look, doesn't last","Update 10/31/2012:The first one never toasted evenly (just didn't bother returning it), then one side stopped toasting altogether.Bought a second one less than a year later (LOVE the color--picture here doesn't do it justice); it worked better initially, then went the way of the first. Still using it only because buying a new toaster hasn't been a priority.So while I the color is great, can't recommend based on performance."
1,Worked great until it broke 10 months after purchase,"This toaster looks really nice and I like how it's fairly compact. It worked really well, but then it broke within 10 months of buying it. The lever would just pop back up whenever it was pushed down. So then I've had to hold it down to toast anything. Obviously I'm looking for a new one now and will try something else besides an Oster."
5,Buying another,"I bought this toaster last year, and it has worked perfectly. Sadly I accidently dropped some birthday candles inside it without knowing... and my beautiful red toaster is... toast. I'm here to buy my second one because I miss it."
1,Burned to a crisp,"Oster 6307 Inspire 2-Slice Toaster, RedWhy is it that we can send a man to the moon, but can't build a reliable toaster?The item I purchased was as follows:PRO: Beautiful red color, reasonable construction and packaging. Plenty of room in the slots for bagels or thick-sliced bread. Nice row of indicator lights.CON: Performance was terrible. From the mid-point on the dial down to the number 2 setting, one side of the bread was brown and the other assorted shades of black. The lowest number produced nothing. I wearied of wasting bread and returned the toaster.Based on other user reviews, quality-control is very inconsistent-you may get a good one, then again, you may not. Hope you fare better than we did."
1,Very disappointed,Toasted unevenly. Sometimes the left edge would be overtoasted and the right edge not toasted at all. Sometimes one side would be toasted and the other side would not. I have been through a few toasters in my 61 years and I have never had one as bad as this one. Didn't anyone test this product design before they marketed the product? I returned it and will never try another Oster.
4,Memories of My Mother's Memories,"My parents came to the US from Poland in the 1920s. My mother grew up in Warsaw. She would have loved this book. She may have known the author's family, and she certainly would have visited the book store owned by the author's father. As I grew up, my mother told me many stories about her life growing up. This book has revived my memories of those stories."
3,Great game...if you don't mind the wait.,"I love bandicoot! That said, I thought I would turn into an old coot by the time the individual scenes loaded....Loading....Loading...Loading...get up and go make yourself a sandwich, come back later and still Loading...Loading...Loading...Seriously the game is fun..lots of different worlds to explore and some of the bosses are really tough. But equally as serious, my wife and I would start a world loading and then go to the kitchen to get a drink while we waited. This is why I rate the game as fun, but overall only 3 stars due to the long load times."
2,very accessible and readable,"I think many readers may find this book useful.Whether you find it useful may depend on whether you are a beginner, that is, on your past exposure to self-development or spiritual growth reading. If you already have strong habits of introspection, you may find the approach of the book too simple for you. (The book is more about ""withdrawal"" than about fear of or struggle with intimacy.)However, if you have not had much chance analyze your past, and want an approach that relies on a traditional foundation, then it book may be very useful to you."
5,Another excellent resource from John Townsend,"I personally have been incredibly blessed and helped by all of the Cloud and Townsend resources I've read. This book, authored by Dr. John Townsend, is truly a timely, heartfelt and useful resource in a time when we're more tempted to hide than to really look at all the forces interacting with our souls. I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from consistent disappointment in your relationships. In fact, I recommend all of the Cloud and Townsend resources to all people willing to do some self-evaluation to ensure a better future. God's blessing to you all."
5,Critically Insightful,"For anyone that is serious about changing their life for the better, this is the book. This is an eye opening book that speaks from God. What better could we ask?"
5,good book!,"This is a good book. I have only read half of it so far, but seems to be good. Easy read."
1,I didn't realize that this is a religious book - not what I want!,"When this book arrived and I flipped through it quickly I saw numerous references to ""God"" and ""Christian"" - this really turns me off as I have no interest in religion. I'll throw the book in the garbage where it belongs."
1,Bad Product,"Nit only did it never get very hot but now all of the titanium is coming off and guess what it's coming off on , my clothes . And try to find a maytag dealer . Not . I cant even get a refund as there are no Maytag actual companies and if there are PLEASE let me know . This was a gift and I dont know where to take it back to ."
1,Don't buy,"This is the worse iron I have ever owned. It will not stay hot without constantly putting it back on its base and waiting for it to reheat. It takes twice as long to iron a shirt or anything else because of this. Especially do not buy if you sew or ever iron anything large, like tablecloths."
2,can't get parts,We paid a lot of money for this iron just a couple years ago. The water tank rotted a hole through it so you can't put water in it anymore. I never stored the iron with water still in it. You can get any other replacement parts for this iron but NOT the water tank. I wouldn't waste my money on it! I do not recommend buying this item.
2,NOT a Plantronics Braded Battery,"This Battery was NOT a branded Plantronics battery as the picture so clearly shows. I paid extra because I wanted an 'authentic', 'branded' battery. While the battery does appear to work, I clearly overpaid compared to other batteries. Buy from someone else selling generics and pay 50% less! Save your money."
4,Yes. It is Plantronics.,"Just to confirm what some reviewers already shared, I received a Platntronics battery with Plantronics instructions. It worked fine and returned my iPhone to the long operating time it had when it was new. My goal, to buy some time till the 4G LTE version hits the market.Two improvements the seller could make. 1) They need to add a pry tool to the tool set that helps with removing the old battery which is doublesided taped to the inside of the case. I had to use a butter knife. 2) They need to include fresh doublesided tape to secure the new battery.I stongly urge anyone changing this battery for the first time to search out video instructions on You Tube. Watch at least 3 different ones. Each highlights different hints to help you be successful. It's worth the time."
4,Keeps on ticking,I was concerned I'd have to replace my Plantronics headset--which has been a great trooper for 5+ years. New battery gives hope for another 5+ years!
5,Plantronics Battery,The replacement battery was exactly the same as the OEM one. Worked perfectly upon installation. Delivery was as indicated by the vendor.
3,the battery does not meet the picture,"the battery works fine but it is NOT a plantronics Battery. In other words the picture shows a plantronics battery and hte name Plantronics, and the battery I got appears to be a 3rd party battery with no mention of plantronics on it. I am not against 3rd party batteries but you should do better at repreenting what you sell"
5,Battery Replacement,The battery was an identical replacement and resolved the problem I was having with the headset. The purchase price was competitive and it was delivered via free shipping timely.
5,Exactly What I Needed!!,This battery is exactly what I needed and now my headset stays charged all day! I have 4 other headets here at work and you can bet that I will be buying more of these!!
5,New battery for my headset,"The phone is over 50% of my job. While on the phone, I need to use the keyboard. A reliable headset is vital. The new battery keeps its charge and I keep working.Amazon had it. Good price and good delivery time.If you need a new battery for your headset, get it on Amazon."
1,joke,they looked good. but i wasnt sent any spacers.they dont do on good. leaks if it rains at all. waste of like 75 bucks or whatever the overpriced price is.
4,"Mental Alchemy--Methods of Self-Improvement, via Astrology","Mental Alchemy is explained, as a Method of Sel-Improvement through analysis of Psychological and Astrological Influences.This course, of the Church of Light lessons, helps the student attain a better relationship with themselves and understand the Astrological and Environmental factors causing stress, anxiety and other negative emotions. Behavior Patterns are explained, in connection with Astrological influences."
5,Excellent Game,Great story. Great graphics. Get the 1.06 Enhancement Pack [14 MB] at the HereticII website which fixes some bugs. There's also a walkthrough there as well some single player add-ons. I love this game.
4,Excellent game,using the Quake 2 engine this game has plenty of action and exploring to be done. It also has a tutorial to get you adjusted to the cusomized controls. and don't forget to download the update from the activision web site.
2,Changing perspective...,"Being a fan of Doom, Doom II and Heretic, I was excited that I could finally purchase Heretic II. It is much more fun, graphically elaborate and intersting to go through than the first three mentioned. I am still going through the levels and having a lot of fun with it.(Added 1/10/02) I have been caught up in a few of the game's glitches for a while now. I have been looking online to see if there is a patch or something, but nothing yet. I have lowered my rating and added this as it is not what I had thought it would be. It has become much more frustrating."
3,Hard material,"This book starts as very legible and even enjoyable prose. However, when the author gets into the real material it is pretty hard to follow for somebody who does not have a great background in OOAD, patterns and UML. This is not a beginners book. However, try reading it, since it is very good material.Be aware, however, of very technical sentences like: ""Containment and visibility are key characteristics of model elements in packages. Packages encapsulate the model elements htey contain and define their visibility as private, protected, or public."" Certainly for somebody with a good understanding of OOAD can discern what is going on, but you will find that many, maybe too many, are written in this way."
3,small car,This car is much smaller than the picture implies. It is the about the same size as a matchbox car. It is fun for my son to play with though.
2,Broken upon arrival,"My son opened this on Christmas morning to find that it had a bent rear axle and would not work. The return process has been smooth so far, but it was a major let down for my son. The quality doesn't seem great on these cars, but the one car that works out of the two we bought works very well and has been through some major abuse. I wouldn't be surprised if it lasts more than another month or two. It is fast and fun, if it works."
3,"In French perhaps, but still a good read.","This strange little book chronicles the misfortunes of a man who checks into a hospital to get his wisdom teeth removed but instead finds himself the recipient of a sex change. I read this book while studying abroad, and it kept me laughing as well as made me think about the idea of gender and identity. I believe it's a French translation of an British novel. Reading it in French definitely helped expand my vocabulary of slang and colloquialisms, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have solid knowledge of l'argot already."
2,Where are the stickers?,I wanted this book because of the the fun bandaid stickers - but I got no stickers. Title did say with stickers.
2,not in condition I expected,"The item has useable stickers to place on characters ""boo boos"". The stickers were all over the book and there were only a couple. I had this book in the past and it had about two dozen bandaid stickers."
3,No delay start option; primitive power selection mode,"Microwave heats well but features are primitive...there is no delay start option, even though the display panel has a timer label; this is apparently decorative, and does nothing, as confirmed by reviewing the manual and contacting the company. Also, selecting power level must be done by repeatedly pressing the power button to count down from 10, rather than using the number keypad, as on earlier models. This was disappointing. Buyers should download the manual and read it before purchasing this unit."
4,Good book. Why not publish a complete set of his works?,"Good book. Would like to see a complete set of his works as well as a biography written by one of his cronies, or an outdoor-life chronicler."
4,Good Beginning,"This Far, No Further is,I understand from the Acknowledgments, Wessel's first published novel. It's a good start; his main character, Harding, is complex and smart. I really didn't like this book at first, because I HATED his client, Elenya Rosenberg, whose husband, Harding is following. I hated her worse than the husband; and Harding is always talking about how he has to protect Elenya. But hating the client is nothing new, I'd never read another Spenser, if I let that bother me. Harding really won me over when he is told by someone that that person had been on hold so long, he had to listen to the whole soundtract of South Pacific and Harding asks "" Broadway cast or Movie version?"" Since, that's something I would ask and since we both like old monster movies, I want to read more books about this character."
5,The beginning of a wonderful series,"I've read all three of John Wessel's books about Harding, the ex-con PI. All three have kept me up late nights, reading ""just one more chapter."" I can't put these books down! This Far, No Further is the first book in the trio, Pretty Ballerina is the second, and its latest (but hopefully not last!) installment is Kiss It Goodbye. All three books are fast-paced, loaded with action, and are damn good mysteries that will keep you scratching your head until the end. Harding's cynical world view leads to some hilarious observances, but this guy's no slouch as a PI; he never misses a trick. Well, almost never. His girfriend, Alison, is equally intriguing as a kick-[butt] femme who keeps Harding on his toes and watches his back. She could give Xena a run for her money! All in all, the characters and the stories in John Wessels' novels a well-worth the price of admission. Wonderful books, all!"
4,"""THE DIRECT TRUTH""","When I listen to Rapgod's cd I felt I really knew him. His lyrics was so defined to the point that when he sang the song ""Rapgod.Com"" the only artist I've ever heard talk about computers to the extent that a child could learn more of the art of computers than ever before. WOW! The song ""Just Like You"" shows the artist is true to his career, and struggling hard to become the best at his craft.The track is so tight I could listen to it over and over.""The Bathroom"" concept was funny but the lyrics and the beat was very serious, I related to that song. I am a living witness to what goes on in the bathroom when I am out at the club. Overall the cd is tight to death. I would like to hear more from him. Thank You"
1,"Well written, but ultimately tedious","Leithauser sure can write; this book is loaded with well-crafted sentences and paragraphs. And lots of fine observations . . . what you'd expect from a poet. Yet the novel is flat, bereft of narrative energy, its characters nuanced but uncompelling. I've read all Leithauser's novels, and my favorite is his quasi-autobiographical book about young Americans in Japan, ""Equal Distance."" Ever since that book, it seems to me that he's been searching for themes and characters worthy of his talent. Alas, what's missing here, despite his best efforts, is a good story. Instead of being a pleasure, ""A Few Corrections"" ends up being a chore to finish."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For; Didn't Drain The Wallet!,"I bought this item in hopes that it would connect to my Macbook Pro to my TV, and display everything. My hopes were fulfilled by this useful cable that now lets me play some of my Computer games using a TV to display them. I used a wireless keyboard and mouse, sat on a chair, and pulled up a small table. Let me tell you: It's epic. When I play games such as Slender or TF2 and get to play it off the TV, I have a lot of fun. It's also useful for playing movies off your computer, so I don't have to buy a physical DVD. I don't think I'll ever use a normal computer screen again!"
1,Cord does not work,"Nothing more to say, Mini display port to HDMI should work. This one does not.If customer service can remedy this issue for me, I will update my review."
1,PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK,I tried this cord on my Macbook to hook it up to my Vizio TV and could not get it to work. I took both my Macbook and the cord to the Apple Store and they discovered that the cord did not work. I purchased a cord from them that worked when I took it home.
4,Pretty good Book.,"Nice Hardcover Book, Good Layout, Some pics I have seen before In mueller books, Other I have not. Pretty Good Book Overall that I was able to get for a Bargain rate.I would recommend it to any chevy buff like myself along with Anthony Young's Small Block Chevrolet Muscle car Color history,Mbi 1992 and Anthony young big block Chevrolet Muscle Car Color History 1993,mbi."
1,Doesn't hold up well,"I've has this blender for about 2 years and it was great at first but either the blade has gotten dull or the motor is wearing out because it makes a horrible loud sound when I try to blend frozen fruit and takes much longer to blend a smoothie than it used to. My parents Braun hand blender costs a bit more but they've had it for about 7 years and we use it all the time and it still works very well.Plus a minor complaint, the cup for blending that comes with this is a little too wide so food and sneak by and not get blended, plus it splashes more easily."
1,it really need a safety lid!,"I liked it because it was powerful and easy to use. But be careful if you are beginner. I used to use one w the lid before.Today I put my fingers in the blender and accidentally turned on. I went to emergency room and realized how it could be dangerous. I agree its very convenient but at the same time, its not safe. Id rather go back to my old blender which has a safety lid."
2,Cuisinart CSB-76BC,"I gave this as a gift because the receipient specifically requested this immersion hand blender. I did investigate this and other hand blenders at a store, and would not have chosen this one for myself or anyone because it makes far too much noise. Otherwise, it appears well-made and is a suitable size. There are other brands that cost slightly more that do operate very quietly, and that for me is the single most important criteria for owning and using one of these. I personally feel that the Cuisinart brand of kitchen appliances does not offer the quality and value of several other brands."
1,smokey and the bandit,Smokey is the blender. Quisinart is the bandit.After a few months the shaft siezed and the unit started smoking in my hand. No heavy duty use. Just a bad product.
2,Not as good as I expect,"I bought this blender for the purpose of grinding food for baby. It does not work well. It worked badly for green vegetables. Even with chicken, I have to position the food around so that the blade of the blinder can touch the food. I want to return the product, but have not found a better alternative except chopping the food with my own hand."
2,Broke in 6 months,"I am almost at the point of hating cuisinart products. I've had about 4-5 products that broke within 1year of normal usage. And this one was the worst of all. Like those pretty colors and while it works, it just wore fine. But the connector seems flimsy and no time burn out and the things stops working. I've had another cuisinart hand blender, a dual blender cum food processor, two toasters, all broke. I wish Braun still made blenders, they were the best."
1,On my 2nd Cuisinart Hand Blender and both no longer work,"I too am on my 2nd Cuisinart SmartStick Immersion Hand Blender. The blender was wonderful when I first bought it and then, poof, it stop working (2x). I too thought it operated so well at first that I bought another one thinking that the first was just a lemon. As another reviewer wrote the drive shaft stopped working on both. The motor turns, just as powerfully as before, but something is broken in the stick and it doesn't turn the blades, which makes it useless. I have always thought quite highly of Cuisinart, but after purchasing two Cuisinart SmartStick Hand Blenders, I do not hold Cuisinart in high esteem any longer. I also purchased one of their coffee makers for Christmas - grind and brew all in one pot and had to bring it back because it was defective (the basket kept popping open during brewing). So, I will no longer be purchasing Cuisinart products, especially this one."
1,Very disappointed.,"It's unfortunate that this product only lasted 4 months. I had such high hopes for it after researching immersion blenders extensively. I had a Philips for years that would power through anything but is no longer made. What caused the demise of this blender? A blueberry and not a frozen one. Somehow it got caught between the blade and the wall and completely stripped the poorly designed plastic housing unit where the blade portion and the motor meet. Shouldn't a metal blade be able to easily cut through a tiny piece of fresh fruit?Four months, that's it! I suppose if you're simply pureeing already cooked soup, you'll be fine but I would not recommend this for smoothies (even un-frozen ones)or for anything un-cooked - those pesky blueberries. Frustrating, to say the least!On the plus side...the color was cute."
1,Please don't pollute the planet,"Don't buy this blender if you want device that will last long. Because of it plastic connector to the motor it will stop working soon and you will end up throwing it away and buying new one. Mine stopped working after 2 years of occasional use. Thanks to the warranty I returned it to Costco and got my money back. Since I didn't use it that often I decided not to buy another one, but use regular blender and food processor that I already have. I dont miss it. I sent email to Cuisinart customer support and expalined that product has major design flaw. They gracefully promised ""to look into that"". Every time in the store when I see their immersion blender on the shelf I check the connector design. It is remains same - plastic. Recently I send email to Consumer reports and they were sympathetic. Not sure if they will do anything. But you can do for sure. DON'T BUY IT."
5,Fast and smooth,"I use the Cuisinart hand blender to mix a powdered chocolate ""shake"" mix in water. It blends my drinks perfectly in very little time. The removable shaft makes it a breeze to clean."
5,Best One I've Ever Used!,I bought one of these in dark blue to use with protein shakes. I was surprised how powerful the suction is and it works great on mixing up all the protein powder. It also chops up ice and frozen fruit quickly! I subsequently bought another one in turquoise to give to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it as well. I think I made the best choice.
4,"Had some trouble blending large ice cubes, but not sure if it's intended for that","Got this as a sort of convenient blender that is easier to set-up and use than a standard countertop blender.I used it the other morning to lazily mix pancake mix, and it whipped it up in like 5 seconds. (There were some powder volcanoes along the base of the mixing bowl, so a quick swish of a bowl scraper solved that)Last night I was curious if I could use it to make a faux-frappucino with coffee, soy milk and ice cubes (from an ice cube tray). The blender had trouble with the ice only because the cubes don't fit between the walls of the blending blade and the blade. I was determined, and used the blending head to ""smash"" the ice cubes against the bottom of the cup, and ultimately it worked! Not sure if this is supposed to blend ice and liquid, but it sort of worked! :)I haven't tried it for soups yet, but I'm excited to make a squash-like soup soon for the fall season..."
4,better than blender,"This hand blender it's really good...don't take any space in the kitchen and for me it works better than a regular blender...excellent for mash potatoes and ""sofrito""...it was delivered real quick...two more people at work also ordered...very happy with the product and fantastic price..."
4,Gave as Christmas gift,Gave to my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She has used it several times in just a few weeks and loves it.
5,My wife loves it.,"I bought this blender to replace one that my wife overworked. I really mean over worked, the plastic part in the drive connection failed after twenty years. I am hoping this one will be her last blender, we both are in our seventies (;-)"
2,Worked great. 6 times.,"I used this stick blender about 6 times. I liked it quite a bit. Plenty powerful for what I needed to do and easily cleaned. However, after putting it back together on the 7th time, the mechanisms didn't quite engage correctly or something and the plastic gears got stripped. It smoked and spun itself into oblivion. I'm not sure if I can find the receipt, so I hope Cuisinart will have mercy on me. I haven't had it more than a few months."
2,Brushed Chrome is Chrome Colored Plastic,"The main reason I bought this Imersion Hand Blender was to replace my old one with a plastic body. I was extremely disapointed when I received my ""Brushed Chrome"" Blender only to find out the body is chrome colored plastic. Upon reviewing the item description, it does say in the fine print ""This Brushed Chrome SmartStick Hand Blender is made from ABS housing"". Well in my book Chrome is metal and ABS is plastic. The only things I like about this blender are that you can remove the shaft assembly for cleaning and the motor is pretty powerful."
5,Very handy!,"I use this blender mostly to make soups, where, to trick my kids, instead of thicken the soup with flour/corn starch, I blend some of the veggies/potatoes/beans/meat with some of the stock and pour it back into the soup. It works great, and on top of it, I can do it even in the pot, it doesn't scratch it! I also used it to make some slushy with frozen fruits and it does a great job at that, too! I used it to crush ice, too, even though it's not recommended, and I think it *is* challenged at that, but win so far. ;) Since there's the five of us, the cup is of no use when blending, it's way to small. I only use it for measuring."
4,Cheesy plastic faux-metal housing,"Got one from this site about a month ago. So far it's been used to make baby food, cream soups, and ""froth"" milk for lattes. It does fine chopping smaller chunks of food, but doesn't work well to aerate liquids (as suggested in product literature) no matter how shallow or deep it's submerged. The blade assembly snaps off the motor handle easily, but the cheap plastic housing and button make me worry about it breaking w/in the year. As with most other Made-in-China items, the ""brushed stainless/ metal"" finish of the motor housing is actually plastic; had I known, I'd have just gone with the usual white plastic. The included plastic blender cup is nice for smaller jobs. For the price I was expecting a little better manufacture."
4,"Works fine, but not ""Chrome""","Just received my item today, it works fine for milkshakes, eggs, batters, etc. As noted by another reviewer, the top body of the blender is NOT metal, it is plastic. The shaft and blending component - which is detachable for cleaning - is all metal, but the part you hold in your hand is indeed gray plastic. In the photos, it certainly looks like chrome, doesn't it?Just a note that when you use the included blending cup or anything else, put the blender in almost all the way down to the bottom before turning it on, otherwise it will splash.I like having a one-touch off/on button, when you let go, the power turns off, so it reduces the chance to blend a finger or accidentally leaving it on.Other than the plastic body, I'm happy with the item. We'll see what happens in a few months after a few batches of soup and smoothies :)"
1,Short lifespan,"I purchased this blender for my parents back in late 2008. The average usage is about 10-15 minutes everyday in blending cottage cheese and flaxseed oil. It suddenly stopped working for no reason after about a year. When I called customer care, they sent me a replacement and I was happy about the service. The replacement blender stopped working last week (after about another 18 months). I was told by customer care this time that the replacement was under the warranty of my original purchase - which is 3 years and it just expired 3 months ago (based on my purchase date on the receipt). I was quite disappointed at the quality of the product and even disappointed by the warranty policy. Would I buy this blender again? No. Would I trust Cuisinart to stand by their products? No."
3,It's plastic,"I should have researched a little further before purchasing this product. When it said ""brushed chrome"" i had no idea it meant brushed-chrome colored plastic. Good product, but not what I had anticipated."
1,Great Disposable Gadget,"This was a wonderful kitchen appliance for about 2 weeks. Then it stopped working. I would rather pay moremoney and get a longer lasting unit than settle for this cheap piece of junk. I thought Cuisinart was supposedto be a good brand. It couldn't whip my cottage cheese, keffir and flax oil concoction without burning out. (We'retalking about the consistency of yogurt here...)I hope Cuisinart re-tools this thing because it could be a really handy kitchen gadget if it had a long life.This is the first online review I've ever done. I feel obliged to review items now because I rely on them SO MUCHwhen I buy products. I hope these reviews we do raise the bar for ALL PRODUCTS and make manufacturers produce higher quality consumer goods. Especially brand names such as Cuisinart. What were they thinking?"
1,LOVED it until it broke WAY TOO SOON!!!,"Let me preface my comments by telling you that I am a Cuisinart fan and a stick blender convert. My disappointment here is that Cuisinart has let me down with a shoddy product that used to work well; now, after only 1.5 years of minimal, lightweight use, their stick blender has let me down!Although most of the small appliances that I own are Cuisinart, and they have been wonderful and dependable and I love them, the first stick blender that I ever bought was an inexpensive Braun model. It worked well, was not fancy, easily made smoothies and pureed soups (which is all I wanted it to do), and it lasted for about 7 years. When it was time to replace the Braun, I decided to go with this model of Cuisinart's inexpensive stick blender; it has performed just like the Braun, which is all I needed, and done the same tasks, which is all that I wanted it to do. However, the Cuisinart stick blender only lasted 1.5 years! What a bust!"
1,"broke after less than 2 year of use, warranty useless","Before buying this blender I had owned a Kitchenaid hand blender, which gave out after 3 or 4 years of use. When I went to buy a new one the Cuisinart model was cheaper, so I figured I would give it a try. I don't think it's ever performed as well as my Kitchenaid model, and the plastic cup it came with started cracking and leaking after a year or so of being put in the dishwasher. The plastic cup my Kitchenaid blender came with is still going strong. But I was still reasonably satisfied with the Cuisinart blender until it died today, after a year and 8 months of using it once or twice a week. Cuisinart says they have a 3-year warranty but the fine print is you have to pay to have it shipped back plus send them a check for $10 to cover shipping the other way. It's not worth my time! This time I'm going with a Kitchenaid."
2,NOT FOR MILKSHAKES,"It seems that most purchasers of this item were happy with it. However, I was looking for a good milkshake mixer, and this item will NOT mix ice cream - - NO MATTER HOW SOFT THE ICE CREAM IS. Apparently, I had too high expectations for this thing and the reviews were so great I thought it might work. It DOES NOT. The so-called ""powerful"" 200-watt motor bogged down EVERY SINGLE TIME I used it, even after the ice cream had melted into mush. Maybe it is okay for some LIMITED uses, but it is NOT worth the money in my opinion."
4,"Yes, it works, maybe too well","Although this unit works fairly well, be advised, it does have quite a bit of power, and if you are careless, you will have frothy something all over the place. (I guess I am saying it has plenty of power, but like all power it needs to be controlled--and this unit only has one speed, high. ) I have kind of stopped using this as I have a new little battery powered unit that has plenty of power for simple things like frothing milk and it is easier to clean (and a moderate amount of power)."
4,Good blender; bad beaker,"I love this immersion blender. Its the second one I've owned and this one is far better. However, recently I've been heating up some liquids in the microwave in the plastic, 2 c. beaker and it has been getting more and more cracked with each time. Finally, the cracks worsened to the point that the beaker LEAKED ! So I threw the beaker away tonight and am now searching for a replacement...ideally in Pyrex. Any suggestions ?The blender is great. I frequently make fruit smoothies with frozen fruit, greek yogurt, splenda and some skim milk. This makes a smoothie that is thicker than most milkshakes...and the blender works hard to get through the frozen strawberries. Its a work horse."
4,Lookin Good:),"I was looking for something to ""whip"" my whey protein drinks as I've just had a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and I think this may just be the trick:) I haven't used it yet but when I do I will leave more feedback as to how it worked. The extra cup that came with it will come in really handy too:)"
4,it works as described...,"* timely shipping* looks good* reasonably priced* most importantly, it works as advertised...* I would recommend this item to anyone that may be skeptical..."
5,The best!!,"I used the Bullet blender for a long time to make baby food but needed a new blender. After reading great reviews for this Smartstick, I was still hesitant, thinking how it will blend the entire pot consistently without leaving any chunks. Well it does a fantastic job!It used to take me at least 15-20 minutes to blend the entire pot of food with the Bullet, with all the transfering required. Even then, it doesn't get all the pieces if I don't blend it extra long. With this Smartstick, it blended everything quickly and took me only one minute for the entire pot!! It's smooth, fun to use, and easy to clean. Love it!"
4,work well. Maybe a bit too powerful.,It works well. I use it to mix protein shake. Some times it spin too fast and the shake get spilled. I wish there is a easier way to make it spin slower. It is easy to clean and it looks nice.
4,Good so far...,I love it for soups that call for puree... that is the main reason I bought it and so far it works really well. I am leery of the review that said there is a cheap plastic part inside that breaks after some use... I will be revising my review if it becomes a problem!
4,The Blender!!,Good product for home everyday use.. Easy to clean after each used..... I like it ... My wife love it to make quickly shake for the run..... You should have one of this around your house at least for emergency..
4,So Far So Good,Very good hand blender. Easy to use and clean up. I had to learn to to immersion blend at first. You don't just cram down on the items being blended. There needs to be a little room so that the suction draws material up into the blades and allows for the material to circulate around. That was operator error on my part. The product itself blends very quickly and thoroughly. Very smooth smoothies.
2,"""Brushed Chrome"" is misleading","Blender seems to work fine, but I chose the ""Brushed Chrome"" model, but it is in reality silvery plastic that looks nothing at all like brushed chrome or stainless. Older reviews specifically mention how this is ""easier to clean than the plastic ones."" I suspect it used to be chrome, but was changed to plastic for cost reasons. The bottom portion is shiny stainless steel, but this is the case for every color for this model."
3,"Falls a little short on accessories, but works great","With the specific features it has right out of the box, it does a great job and is very sharp! However, we really wish there was more flexibility with usage and accessories. We chop nuts often and this is not the answer for that because the chopper doesn't have any attachment to chop in an enclosed environment. You can only chop in the open cup provided. We have made it work most of the time, but tend to make a mess and not get the finely chopped size we got with another model. I went online to search for other accessories and there aren't any for this model. But you get what you pay for, this model is not expensive at all. Just wish there was a covered version of the chopping cup."
5,Great for smoothie lovers!,"I love this hand blender! I like to make fruit smoothies and got tired of dealing with cleaning the regular blender. Now I just throw everything right into the cup that comes with it: one banana which I break into pieces, one fruit cup, one six oz. yogurt and some fruit juice or water. In goes the blender and after minute I'm done! Perfectly smooth - no chunks like the regular blender. The end pops off and goes right into the dishwasher! No mess at all! I grab a straw and enjoy my smoothie right out of the blender container. Fantastic!"
1,"Lasted 5 months, was told to just buy a new one","This Smartstick blender worked great for 5 months, then it stopped working. Since it was under warranty I called Cuisinart. I was told that I would have to pay to have it shipped to them, and then pay $10 for the shipping of the new hand blender to me. I asked why if it had only been 5 months why I should I pay anything. I was told that since it is a low cost item it is cost prohibitive to charge the shipping both ways. If it was a $500 item they would pay the shipping. The shipping would be the same cost as buying a brand new one. Thanks but no thanks.tl;dr Don't buy this, Cuisinart considers them disposable."
1,Planned obsolescence,"I bought the unit in May of this year. All was well until the wand portion rolled onto the floor. Although there is no visible sign of damage, the unit no longer turns. I contacted Cusinart, told them what happened with the hopes they might offer me the opportunity to purchase a new wand section. Had I lied and told them it just stopped working, they might have covered it under warranty. In telling the truth and in finding that I can not purchase the replacement wand, I find I have spent $29.95 for nothing. A manufacture that doesn't offer the opportunity to purchase replacement parts has taken planned obsolescence a little too far in my opinion."
1,stopped working after 4 uses,Was happy to get it and start blending for guacamole and hummus. The 4th time (about 6 months later) the thing started stopping intermittently and then completely quit. Sometimes it will kick on for a few seconds just to tease me. These people raving about their 3 year model must have bought the last good ones before they started putting this crap in the box. Not worth it.
1,Beware of Cuisinart Hand Blender,"I have owned a Cuisinart Hand Blender with the chopper attachment for about a year and a half. The chopper quit after three uses (gears were stripped) and the stick blender only lasted for about 10 uses, also a stripped gear problem. I returned the product card when I received this item (Dec. 2010) but since it was a gift, I do not have a receipt. Cuisinart refuses to stand behind their three year warranty as I do not have a proof of purchase. Why bother to return the product card if they don't recognize it? So, if you expect your stick blender or chopper to stand up to ordinary kitchen use for more than six months, avoid this product. Better still, avoid all Cuisinart products as they will not honor their warranty. You will be wasting your money. Look for another company; Kitchen Aid comes to mind. They care about their customers and provide a quality product. I would not give any stars but it's the only choice I have."
5,Cuisinart SmartStick,I only wish it had variable speed. The detachable shaft is a great ideea and it makes cleaning a breeze.
5,where has this been all my life,"after spending most my life avoiding making things with a blender because that clunky conventional table-top blender was just a pain in the butt to use/wash after one use, this smartstick blender is nothing short of a miracle. it takes up barely any storage real estate, assembling it is one snap (literally), blending is amazingly efficient (ive only tried softer things so far; avocados, icecream, fruits, etc, everything comes out smooth), and its quiet purr (unlike those tabletop jackhammers) wont wake up your housemate in case you want a midnight smoothie.now the best part. i am a self professed hater-of-all-things-that-need-washing-in-the-sink. cleaning this blender is so easy it gives me the giggles. it takes me 30 seconds. SECONDS. stick it into a cup of clean water, blend, repeat, and it comes out sparkly clean. mind. blowing.did i mention how cheap the price is? go get this now!!!"
4,"Boy, It works Well","Wife saw it at the store but did not want it. But, after seeing one of those cooking shows on cable. She changed her mind quick and it was under our tree for Christmas."
4,Good for thinner liquids,This thing is pretty great. Very easy to clean. No complicated parts. It is very powerful. I used it to make a bean dip in 5 min and had no extra dishes to clean up. The only problem I have found with it is it will get very hot after prolonged use. I was worried when I began to smell plastic! It still works great and now I know to be more careful when using it for a longer period of time.
3,Works ok.,I'm a bit disapointed with this tool. I was hoping I could really puree soups but it leaves the soup pretty lumpy. I may be expecting too much.
4,great product,I have the 400 watt Braun stick blender which has been discontinued and was looking for a similar one as a gift for my mother. She loves the Cuisinart and feels it works just as well as my 400 watt machine. I shopped around to many local and on-line stores and Amazon still had the best price. I read other reviews to say to use smaller ice cubes when making shakes. It also helps to use smaller pieces of frozen fruit to make smoothies.
5,Great product,This was exactly what I thought it would be. Great quality and craftsmanship at a reasonable price. Also it arrived a day earlier than expected which I was very pleased about.
5,smoothies,i can make smoothies with this and mix my cereal and milk without having to use my dull boring spoon.
4,Love it!!,"I purchased this item in November 2012. I use mine mainly for making iced drinks and love it!! It blends the ice to a very fine and smooth consistency quickly. I use it daily. After having it for about 1 month, there was a popping sound and a light flashed from the ""on"" button while I was using it. Of course, it immediately stopped working. I contacted Amazon, and they immediately sent me a replacement. I've only been using the new one for a few days, but still love how it works. Hopefully this one will last longer."
5,Great for soups and sauces,"This product is easy to use and clean. It is great for sauces, especially tomato sauce, or blended soups, especially when kids don't like finding little bits of onions or other veggies."
2,Great...for a while...,"As with others reviewers, place where the two sections attach has stripped and it will no longer click together. Was great while it lasted...got maybe 30 uses out of it."
5,Very Satisfied,"I've had this for about a month now, with no problems. It blends well and is easy to clean."
5,A great little blender,"We really like the way this immersion blender works. It is great for sauces and soups and easy to use. I have another, plastic model, that I use when I make soap which really shortens the stirring part of the process."
1,Not sturdy,"I have owned two of this particular type of blender, both of them have died in similar ways where the motor turns fine but the blades do not spin. After the first one died I went looking on amazon again and saw the great reviews for this blender and thought it must have just been a bad device, but now I believe it's just poor quality product line. I don't blend anything rough, mostly just protein shakes, but I do use it regularly for that.I will be trying another brand."
1,Broken after 3 months,Dont think of using this for anything but vegetables. The clutch gave out trying to blend frozen bananas. Now it wont chop anything.
2,The body (the part you hold in yoiur hends) of this item is NOT Brushed Chrome,"Yes, that is surprising, isn't it? Only the 3/4th of the attachment seems to be metal. The connection assembly is also plastic. The whole blender is quite cheap looking. Hence the negative reviews about this item not being sturdy. I shouldn't have disregarded it before I purchased this item. Absolutely FALSE advertising. Cuisinart and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. It works well, but I don't know how long it will last to be honest. $30 I spend is too much for this blender."
3,Cheap device ..,"This device is cheap but It`s not so powerful, and get hot very fast.I`m not sure how long it gonna work.But for this money is a good deal."
4,My go-to blender when doing small amounts or smoothies,"I thought I was going to use this blender to make sauces and soups only but I find myself more and more often reaching for it to make things like dressings, sauces for the soups and smoothies. I've only had it for about a month and so far it's a great purchase. I use to own a proctor silex a long time ago when my kids were babies (they are now in their teens) I used to use it mostly to make baby food. I would puree most of their food and one day the motor just gave up on me. I hope this one lasts longer than that one did."
5,A Must Have Kitchen Gadget,"I am in the ""less is more"" school of kitchen gadgetry, partly because I have limited space to store things and partly because of a long history of buying things which get little or no use. I finally gave in and bought a Cuisinart Immersion Blender and could not be happier with my kitchen addition. This makes quick work of fruits for smoothies and is indispensable for creaming soups. It does a lot more than that (including emulsifying oil and egg for mayonnaise) and I could not be without one. If I had to choose between this and a conventional blender, the blender would be gone.The Cuisinart is well built and easy to use. One tip: always submerge the blender into a cup of soapy hot water immediately after use. It cleans up quickly and easily."
4,Does the job!,"I bought this as a gift for my mom. She had been using my immersion blender, theKitchenAid KHB100ER Hand Blender, Empire Red(which I love).For the price this is a great tool. It's powerful enough to blend up cooked butternut squash and potatoes into soup. I wouldn't use it for whipping potatoes or anything like that, but it's good as an immersion blender. It has only one speed, which is fine for most of the things you'll use it for."
4,I like it,So far working well to make baby food so I am pleased. Good Power and easy to clean and not bulky.
4,Good Value & Ergonomic Design.,"This seems to be a well-made and very easy to use blender. I needed it for pureeing hot soups that were far to messy and slightly dangerous to be doing in the regular blender.First, it looks great and feels solid. When I wrap my hand around it and press the button, it feels just right. I like the ergonomics of the thing. It blends well....I have made a few soups and homemade whipped cream with it. The blade attachment comes off very easily, and is also easy to clean. The only thing I would want that this doesn't have is variable speeds, but this is just quibbling. For what I spent, I am very happy with it."
5,Great Stick,"I love the way this thing purees everything. It is so nice to be able to snap the end off the motor and put it in the dish water or dishwasher. This is replacing my 20 year old one, that was hard to clean because the end was so small and the cord got in the way.I am very happy with my SmartStick."
4,Good blender,Does everything except crush ice. Super easy to clean which makes it superior to all other blenders I have had.
5,Great product,This blender is perfect for mixing liquid ingredients like soups but my favorite use is to mix whey protien powder in my beverage after a lift.
5,Cuisinart Hand Blender,I really like this gadget since it is handy and makes so manyfood preparations so quick and easy.
1,Kaput! after about 8 months,"Worked well, I really appreciated its lightness and balance, used it about once or twice a month for blending creamed soups and other soft stuff, but died before a year. I could not find my receipt, so could not take advantage of its demise (bent shaft) within the one year warranty. If you buy it, put the receipt where it is easily accessible, cuz you'll probably need it."
4,"FYI, before putting it in the dishwasher","Length:: 1:32 MinsI've had this for a few months now and I absolutely love it. It performs well. FYI, even though the box says ""dishwasher safe"", it may not withstand the heat from some dishwashers."
4,Efficient Stainless Steel blender for lighter jobs,"This Cuisinart blender has no plastic parts that come into contact with food. That alone was a big plus point in its favour when I bought it. I have been using it for the past several months without any complaints. I use it to blend big batches or soup and to whip an occasional batch of cream or soup. It is much more convenient to use and clean than a traditional blender. However, it's not really powerful enough so it takes quite a while to blend the entire pot of soup. It is extremely easy to handle, use and clean, so that makes up for the lost time in trying to blend a big pot of soup as thoroughly as a traditional blender. As is the case with even traditional blenders, you need to be careful and allow 30 second breaks between every minute and a half of blending to prevent the motor from overheating. You will smell burnt motor oil/parts if you don't take this precaution.Recommended for lighter blending jobs."
5,LOVE IT!,"LOVE this hand blender! SUPER easy to clean! Makes wonderful individual smoothies. Just what I was looking for!Yes, I recommend this product."
2,Lasted 6 months,"I loved it until it broke.The inner gears of the motor are plastic and eventually they stripped and no longer turned the blade.I do make a lot of soups where I would need the blender to puree potato and pumpkin, so perhaps my use is not typical. I'm hoping to find one with all metal gears as this has happened with other kitchen implements.It was great while it lasted, i liked that it detaches the blade portion for dishwashing."
1,Lasted 7 months...,"This product is far from durable. The motor gave out after seven months (it just slowed down and then stopped spinning altogether). I had been using it only once or twice a week, to make fruit & yogurt smoothies and pureed vegetable soup: normal use for which it should have been designed. Very disappointing!"
3,Works well until it doesn't,"We've gone through two of these and have now learned our lesson. It was fantastic at first but over time, the shaft started getting loose in the housing and the blade assembly began moving up and down. I think this has to do with using it on crushed ice. Unfortunately, that's the bulk of what it is used for; smoothies/protein shakes. What ends up happening is that drinks become REALLY frothy to the point that I had to use larger and larger containers to mix things in as the volume of liquid kept increasing in a crazy manner. Even doing that, after a while it started throwing stuff all over the kitchen. There was a review of another mixer that had an all-metal shaft unit so I'm off to track that down."
5,Love it,"This thing works great, easy to clean too. The only thing that would make this thing better would be if it were cordless."
1,Weak,"I tried to blend one carton ice cream,and it overheated. It only one setting. You would be better off buying aOster 6706 6-Cup Plastic Jar 10-Speed Blender, Black"
5,Best tool in my kitchen,"I bought this hand blender in order to shift from coffee each morning to a fruit shake. This item is just great, I have tried few others that were a disaster.I loved it so much I bought one for my parents. It is so easy to use and clean, take no space at all,and not very noisy. I have been using it at least once or twice a day for the past 6 months"
5,Great and not messy!,"I use this everyday for blending custom protein shakes.. it's very quick, simple, and you can clean it quick when you're done... A+ IMO"
4,Great gift idea,"This is a great gift idea for friends who like to cook. Although I prefer the variable speed feature on the KitchenAid Hand blender, this product is quite acceptable and does a fine job."
4,Replacement Hand StickBlender,"I purchased the Cuisinart CSB-76BC to replace an old Protor Silex stick blender, that served me well. What I like about this product is the ease in clean up. Being able to wash the lower unit, without having to emerse the motor not only proves safe, but practical. Since I've only had the appliance about a month now, I rate it at 4 stars,....to soon to tell how long it'll last. However, considering the great purchase price, and ease of ordering on Amazon, I'd be more that happy if I get a few good years of service from this product. So far so good,... :)"
3,"Great Blender, terrible blending beaker","I have used this many, many times, probably around 150. However, this morning, making my coffee smoothie, the bottom just popped off! My smoothie spilled EVERYWHERE and now the rug smells like coffee and cocoa. I'm disappointed in the beaker but the actual blender is great."
5,Great gadget!,I love the usefullness of this kitchen toy. I've been using it to make delicious soups this winter and it works like a dream. So much easier than taking the soup out in batches to blend it. It cleans very easily too. Highly recommend!
5,No more soup on the ceiling,This tool has eliminated all the frustrating times of pureeing soups or making smoothies when the blender top ejects itself and the food goes flying. It's easy to use and to clean. I love it!
3,Needs Engineer to Redesign Drive,"This is lightweight, easy to clean, plenty of power. Perfect for making a quick smoothie or use in a pot.But, there is a weak plastic part that self destructs under normal use. When this part wears down the motor is still good, the blending head is good, but you have a piece of junk. It is not a replaceable part. If you force it into your mix this part strips quickly (months). If you coddle it --it will last only a little bit longer. The part is the friction fit between the drive motor and the blade shaft."
3,review,"I didn't read product info thoroughly before purchase! Therefore, will return product because doesn't have the whipper attachment. I want one that can blend and whip. Otherwise, looks great!"
4,Powerfull and clean,"This thing is powerfull, easy to use, and easy to clean. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. I was amazed the first time I used it and I now look for recipes that I can create with this. It is an enjoyable experience.Edited for additional information on 14 October 2010:After using this hand blender heavily, it developed a high pitched grinding noise when running. To fix this and restore the original operation, just squirt a small amount of WD-40 down the inside of the shaft. Run the hand blender for a few seconds in the normal, upright operating position while the WD-40 works into the bearings. Once it reaches the bearings, the noise will immediately disappear. Try not to use too much WD-40 as you don't want excess oil leaking through the shaft into the food. I'm attaching a picture of me squirting the oil in the product images so you can see where to apply the squirt of WD-40.WD-40 11005 Lubricant, Aerosol Can with Smart Straw, 8 Fluid Ounce, 3"" OD, 2.63"" Length"
1,Faulty Design Dooms This Product,"The immersion blender by Cuisinart is by far the worst product the company makes. I am surprised they haven't pulled it from the market because it is designed to fail.The problem is PLASTIC: it will not stand up to use, even over a short period of time. Those who have not used the product long will no doubt give it a glowing review, but it won't be long before the plastic wears down and the device will no longer work.Indeed, the ""chopper"" attachment which came with my purchase NEVER worked. Then the whisk gave out and finally the chopper.So I would advise that you avoid this product. The company is also not very helpful in responding to complaints I guess that are totally embarrassed by the poor quality."
1,Breaks after a few months of light usage,"If I could give this product a zero, I would. Worked wonderfully the first dozen times I used it. Then it slowly started coming disconnected at the hinge and finally it would not stick at all. The blade would work half of the time. Cuisinart quality overall has gone down over the years. We had a coffee pot by Cuisinart that died in less than a year as well. Needless to say I will not be purchasing Cuisinart products in the near future."
5,How did I live without this gadget?,I love this tool. Scrambled eggs come out so much better. I also use it to foam my hot milk for my homemade lattes. It is very easy to keep clean and also easy to store since the blade detaches from the handle. I have had it for a year and not had any problems with it at all. Love it!
1,Horrible Screeching Noise,"I bought this for basic kitchen use, mostly a smoothie a few times a week. After 6 months it began to make horrible screeching noises. They became worse and worse. The unit never ceased to function, but the accompanying noise made using it impossible to tolerate. I paid to have the unit exchanged ($10, plus me shipping the unit to them). The new unit arrived quickly and new in box. It worked great. For 5 months. The new one has begun to make the same god-awful noises and they are only increasing. I have other Cuisinart products that I love, but this is crap for it to happen twice. I will NOT be buying another."
1,Drive shaft stripped after 6 months. Warranty requires $$.,"Like many of the other 1 star reviewers, I loved my blender until it suddenly made a terrible stripping gear noise and stopped functioning. The warranty requires you pay for shipping to Cuisinart along with a check for $10. For that price, it almost makes sense to buy a replacement and forgo the warranty."
4,Parsley color not as pictured,"Just a note - the color ""Parsley"" is not as pictured. It is actually a bright lime green.That said, I still love this immersion blender!"
5,Love it!,"We use our immersion blender at least once a week. This device is perfect for all of our blending needs. It has replaced our food processor for a lot of jobs. The CSB-76BC works perfectly for everything we've thrown at it. Soups, purees, blended drinks, baby food, sauces, etc. We have not found any job that it cannot handle. We are 100% satisfied and highly recommend this product to others."
5,Great hand-held blender,Our old immersion blender died and this is what I bought to replace it. I love it. Very powerful and easy to clean. Reasonably quiet. Does everything we expected it to do very well.
2,single motor speed,"The motor only has one high speed so if you are not submerging the head in a sufficient depth of a sufficiently viscous solution, it will splatter everywhere. For example, I tried to blend a couple cups of liquid in a mixing bowl with high sides and it made a mess because it could not go slow enough. Maybe it's better in a deep cup but that reduces the tool's flexibility in food preparation. I have a Bosch hand drill bought new for the same price as this blender and it has variable motor speed, two gear speed ranges, forward and reverse, more torque, and more interchangeable elements available for it. Cuisinart is selling a twelve dollar tool here for a lot more."
3,Great...for the first six months!,"I used this product almost everyday for soups, smoothies, to make hummus, sauces, etc. Unfortunately, the plastic connecting the motor to the attachments melted after six months. It's not super powerful, but it does look good. I bought the blender on sale for $19.99, so maybe you get what you pay for. oh and the whipping attachment makes an unholy mess."
2,Upset customer,"I bought two of this blenders to be used in my kitchen. Unfortunately after few days of using it stop working. Is not a motor problem but the material which is used to make the parts is so poor quality that is not able to hold the bottom part, which is the one that blends.I contacted the company and they asked me for my information, I provided, since then I have passed almost two weeks and I have not answer yet, meanwhile am stuck with two blenders unable to make my cakes neither to buy another one.I will never buy anything from this company, they don't appreciate the customers."
3,Weak on power big on chunks,"Under powered. You need to like chunky smoothies. An oxymoron to be sure but you get tired of the droning of the engine long befor your smoothy is smooth. Good for mixing up Quick, but then so is a spoon."
5,Perfect,Best tool I've purchased in several years. I'm amazed at how many times a week I use it. Clean up is so effortless. It is also compact and easy to tuck out of the way.
5,Great Blender,I love this so much I bought a second one after a year so that I would have a spare if it ever conked out. I use it daily to make a blenderized diet version of all the meals we eat. It makes a fine consistent blend. I have had this for nearly 2.5 yrs now and I still love it. The cup cracked but the blender is still going strong.
1,"Didn't last, poor design",This was a great immersion blender while it lasted. The drive shaft is connected with a plastic piece that stripped after less than a year of light use. I had to throw the whole thing away. I used this immersion blender maybe once a week to make soups and occasionally to make mayo. I am now looking to replace it with a different model.
5,Been wanting one for years.,This works well in processing soup stock. It is quick and easy to clean. Just what I needed to make cooking faster and easier.
4,bought as a gift,My sister loved this item. It is a great combination of kitchen tools. Great to have in a small kitchen
4,Seems good,"I've only used this maybe a dozen times, and it's worked great for each application. (Creaming soups in the pan, making a smoothie, etc.)However, I'm a little worried about the cheap plastic piece Cuisinart used for the gear. Is it going to break soon???Many reviewers (and comments on reviews) have shown this to be a problem. :/Bummed I didn't see all the color options before I bought this in silver/grey. I so would have loved this in the turquoise! Oh well."
1,No replacement parts,"Things break when they are used. These days, manufacturers seem to want you to buy another copy or upgrade when the smallest plastic thingy cracks or goes wrong. That's not environmentally sustainable, and manufacturers need to accept responsibility for the life cycle of their products.We owned a CSB-76 for just about a year, when the plastic base cracked. We are out of luck. Not only can you not get a replacement plastic housing, you cannot get a complete replacement mixing stick, but have to re-purchase the motor and everything. What would happen if the blades dulled?We are getting another hand blender, but we will be sure it has replacement parts first, and it WILL NOT BE A CUISINART."
5,Niece loved it,This item was a gift. The recipient says she loves it and uses it often. She would recommend it to others.
5,Hand Blender,I Love it. It has very good power.Wanted a purple one but I am glad I did not spend the extra just for color.
5,Versatile,"Powerful, fast, easy clean up. I use this for everything from large soups to scrambled eggs, batter, fruit and vegetable purees (for my baby). It is easier to clean up than other blenders--just pop off the blade arm from the motor and wash it right away. It is so strong that it creates a suction so if you put in on the bottom of a deep pot FULL of soup it will lift the whole thing! If you are planning on using it for smoothies and you are using frozen fruit you will need to precut larger pieces (like strawberries) so that it will fit in the gap around the blade, and use crushed ice--though if you are using frozen fruit you probably won't need to use ice."
5,BUY IT NOW!!,I wanted something small and quick to make frozen coffee drinks. I ended up buying the Back to Basics Blender Express and am sorry that I wasted my time! The stick blender is perfect for smoothies and frozen coffee and it's super quick and has practically no clean up! The blades are very sharp and it's pretty powerful! So if you're looking for something to make a quick smoothie I'd suggest the Cuisinart :D
1,absolute nightmare,"Generally, Cuisinart is a good brand. I bought 2 identical units over time of this blender. Both lost traction within a month (i.e. stop spinning).absolute disaster and waste of money."
5,Great product,I purchased this as a gift and it is smiliar to one I bought for myself. This model is an improvement in that the blender wand is stainless and would not stain from use with colored vegetables such as carrots or squash.
2,"Started great, stripped out the gear before a year was up!","If I had written this when I first purchased I would give it a 5 star review. It worked great for the first 20 uses. I have owned it about 9 months and it is done. The plastic section inside is stripped. Big bummer. What I read says that although it has a 3 year warranty, the cost to replace that part with shipping makes it half the value. I was so hopeful that this would last longer. We don't even use it that much, mainly for soups...."
4,Smart Stick review,"This product was received by me within 5 days of ordering and has proven to be everything that was advertised. Very pleased with performance. It's used mainly for making smoothies, protein drinks and milkshakes. Its been excellent and very easy to clean."
1,deceiving photo,"I did a search for cordless Cuisinart hand blenders and found this....hand blender with great reviews. Looking at the photos, I see no chords. I buy the blender; open it up & it has a cord. I go back to Amazon & double check what I purchased & yes, Photoshop has made the cord disappear."
2,WEAK! Guess you get what you pay for...,"We had a Kitchen Aid Model before this. I believe the Kitchenaid was about $10.00 more but WELL WORTH IT! This smartstick is CRAP.1-- It feels chinsy and made from thin plastic.2-- Only has ONE speed SETTING!!!??? WTF?3-- NO POWER 200watt my azzz4-- GET the Kitchenaid( ANY) The model Kitchenaid I had, had 9 different speed settings and was about twice as powerful and felt like it was built much better.If your looking for a hand blender that does more than blend eggs twice a week, This aint your hand blender."
4,Does the job,"But it's not as easy as I had hoped. I make a lot of soup and was tired of blending it in batches in the blender. This is easier, but not much."
5,MILKSHAKES,This is the absolute best thing you could get to make milkshakes. It is really easy to clean and feels like it is high quality. I've always hand washed it and have never had any problems with it.
2,Good deal but doesn't deserve Cuisinart name,Well made for an item from an imported country (china) but is very poor quality to have the Cuisinart label on it.
5,Great value; works well!,"This hand blender works really well and does a great job of blending vegetables in soup together as well as smooth. In fact, the first time I made broccoli cheese soup with it, I probably blended it a bit too much, as I like my soup a tad chunky. Next time I didn't blend as much and it turned out perfect."
5,Great little mixer!,Glad I order this mixer. It is great & gets the job done quick. Easy to clean up.The price was good.Giddy
5,Two years - still going strong!,I've owned this blender for two years now and I could not be more pleased with it. I love to be able to cream my soups right in my pots (I used to do it with the regular blender - messy!). I have used it with non-stick pots with no problems since you don't have to submerge it all the way for it to work. It is very easy to use and clean. I also love that I can make a couple of smoothies without having to get the big blender dirty (I just hate doing dishes). Definitely one of my favourite kitchen gadgets. My mom was staying with us for a couple of days and used it to make us one of her trademark soups - she just loved it - guess she is getting it for christmas!
5,works well for me!,"bought this to make soup purees and for that purpose, it's been great.potato leekroasted tomato basilcreamy cream cornand the list will just continue = )"
5,love it!!!,"this is the first immersion blender that i have ever purchased, and i am so glad i did!!! for a cuisinart, i thought the price was a steal, and all of the other reviews here solidified my decision. this blender is easy to use, easy to clean, looks sleek, and purees in SECONDS. i totally recommend it!"
5,"Love it, buying a replacement after 5 years of great service","My first Cuisinart Smart Stick finally gave up the ghost this morning after 5 years, so I'm buying a replacement. It was a little workhorse. I use mine for making smoothies, which means crunching through ice and frozen fruit. I've used it at least 3 times a week for 5 years. I like that it comes apart and I can put the blender part in the dishwasher. Buy it, you'll love it."
2,Broke in 2 months,"This was a Christmas present for my husband. He loved it for whipping up eggs for his morning omelet. I used it several times to puree soups. Yesterday when I pureeing a lentil soup, the beaters stopped (although the motor still ran). It's useless now. Not as sturdy a product as I would have expected."
5,BEST THING I EVER DISCOVERED,"I have had this for 3 years now and it is awesome for using to make a smoothie, powdered protein shake, soups, cake mixes, to name a few! I also sneak veggies in my spegetti -I sautee some carrots, onion, garlic cloves, squash, zucccini and mushrooms and I throw it in the pot of spegetti sauce and I puree it in there and my kids don't have a clue they are eating so much vegies! And it is so easy to clean! I just fill my 2-cup plastic mixing cup with hot water and soap and I run it in there and then rinse the same way. Just too easy!"
4,Works wonderfully,"I have been pleased with this purchase and find that it works very well. I have used this product to mix cold processed soap and will not be using it on food products. It is not very loud although it does make some noise. I like the weight and handle of the product.The only problem I have had with it is during cleaning the blade it can be difficult to get above the blade. This would be a bigger problem I think if I were using food. Otherwise, this is a great product! Oh and the side cup is nice too."
3,Works but,"This is easy to use when preparing baby food. But food stuck inside the cup above the blade if it is dry. I need to add water to release it. Once water is added, it does a fair job, but without water, chopping anything like vegi or meat is not possible."
5,LOVE,I love this stick blender. It is so handy for creaming soups! I use to transfer batched to my food processor but now I just stick this in the pot and in a minute or 2 it is done with no mess!
5,Smoothest soup ever!,"I had been wanting to get one of these for awhile and with soup season (Fall and winter) on, I decided to go for it. I had made some soup and pureed it in my food processor but it was okay. In the meantime, this came in, so I used this to see if it would make any difference. I really didn't expect to notice any change, but was very pleasantly surprised to find a HUGE difference! my soup was completely smooth and thicker! I've only used it a couple of times so far, but eager to try experiment with more. Easy cleanup, easy to use, very comfortable to hold."
2,Smart Stick doesn't hold up,"I have been joyfully using this ""stick"" for making fruit smoothies, gazpacho, and zucchini soup for more than a year. That is until last week. It started squealing and is now shot. It's never seen an ice cube or anything solid enough to jam the blade. The plastic ""teeth"" on the spline are gone and the shaft moves 1/4"". If I had spent twice the amazon price and bought a Kitchen Aid I would still be smiling."
1,Broken After 3 uses,"I recieved this immersion blender as a birthday present. I was very excited about it when I made butternut squash soup! Clean up was a breeze. Everything seemed great until I tried to make strawberry milk. I cut up the strawberries, added milk and honey and started to blend. Before long, the blender started to smell, and the blade wasn't spinning. When I took it apart to see what was going on, the unit that holds the shaft for spinning the blade was warped/melted therefore no longer able to grid and spin it. This was only the 3rd time I've used it and I wasn't using it on anything too intense...no ice or anything. I contacted the manufacturer but I haven't heard back. Extremely disappointing!!"
5,Great for Baby Food!!,"This is the third blender I have used to make baby food and it is by far the best. The first one I tried was just a regular blender, then I tried a baby bullet type machine made by Babies R Us. I finally decided to try a hand blender and I'm so glad I did. It gets everything smooth in a matter of seconds. It took me less than one minute to puree three sweet potatoes. With the other two appliances I had before it would have taken at least 30 minutes. I can't wait to make the rest of my baby's food with this blender. I wish I would have bought this sooner."
3,could be better,"Although this works to mix, which is helpful, it is not as efficient as it should be. Ingredients do spill out of the cup and the consistency does not equal using a hand blender. It is convenient in size and storage, but I would have expected a better product from Cusinart. I think it is best to buy a higher watt immersion blender if you are looking to create a whipped texture."
2,Wonderful until it starts screaming,"This is a great product while it works. Powerful, easy to store and a breeze to clean. But.... As other reviewers have pointed out, the plastic parts wear out quickly and the blender goes kaput, making a horrible grinding noise. I used mine lightly for about a year before it started to scream at me. What was it screaming? BUY ANOTHER BRAND, BUY ANOTHER BRAND."
5,Powerful,"This is a great immersion hand blender. I made marinara from home grown tomatoes and what used to take, it seemed, forever to liquify the tomatoes was done in just no time at all. No mess either. I was able to do it right in the pot I was cooking in. I highly recommend..."
1,broke after only 7 months,"The coupling that is inside the motor body housing broke after only 7 months use and we did not put excessive wear on it. Cuisinart must know this thing is a piece of junk, because it has a 3 year warranty. They make you pay shipping to return it and shipping and handling to get another one.My take, do not buy this."
2,Not durable,"Already broken, in less than 6 months. We use it daily for smoothies, and occasionally for soups, sauces. This is the 2nd version of this model we have had. the first one we had about 2 yrs and the blade rusted out of the shaft. This time a piece inside has come loose so the motor cannot spin the blade. I am moving on."
1,Wish I could give it zero stars,Was a great hand blender for about 1.5 months. Then the plastic gear stripped just like the picture another reviewer shared. If you want a replacement you have to send $10 shipping. Considering this lasted literally 1.5 months the warranty is useless. Don't buy this model unless you want to lose money for very short usage.
5,Great little machine,"This is a great little machine, and it blends beautifully. I used to puree my soups in a blender, and when I used this for the first time I immediately noticed the difference in smoothness. My only disappointment would be that I wish there were attachments available for it to use it for other tasks."
5,Great investment for the kitchen!,"I bought this for my baby since she was starting on her solid food. Perfect choice! It blends everything well, from rice to vegetables. I don't have to worry about getting some chunks in her food. The best part is, it is easy to clean. Just detach the metal part, and you can wash it. Don't have to worry about sharp blades like the big blender, and the electrical part like my current chopper.My husband loves it too for his special squash soup!"
3,The details left out of the description...,"Cuisinart CSB-76 SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, WhiteI got this recommended stick blender to make small quantities of mayonnaise using natural ingredients. It takes at least 4-5 minutes of constant blending to emulsify the egg yolks, and then the added oil. The users' handbook tells me that the blender can only run continuously for only 50 seconds. Now I am stuck with a blender that doesn't do what I specifically bought it for. I researched it thoroughly, and nowhere was the time limitation mentioned, or I wouldn't have bought it. I know there are simple, inexpensive stick blenders out there that do what I want - I had one when I lived overseas. It ran for as long as I needed. It even crushed ice into a smoothie. I purchased the blender through the Amazon site from Beall's in Florida. The only fault of the seller or Amazon was the omission of this significant detail in the product description."
1,Breaks down very quickly.,My wife has purchased two unit over the past year and both have failed in less that 6 months each. One failed at the blade end - the bushing rapidly wore out causing the shaft to wobble excessively. The second unit failed at the interface between the upper motor portion and the lower blade portion causing a grinding noise and no movement at the blade. The unit was used on a daily basis so it looks like 180 days of use is about the limit so if you use it occasionally you will probably get several years of use.
1,Disappointed,"I started using my hand blender right away making morning smoothies. On the second day of using the hand blender, it started shooting sparks and stopped working completely. There is a 3 year warranty, but you have to pay for the shipping and handling both ways. So far the replacement is working great, but I am still disappointed in the hassle and added cost of having to get a new one after having the first hand blender for a day."
5,This Rocks!,"This handmixer is just perfect for us. I recently started taking a powder supplement, that doesn't mix well with liquid. This mixer will blend it in to juice or a smoothie. No matter how frozen the fruit is, this little mixer seems to plow through it. I've recently used it to make shakes for the kids. Works better than my blender. The only drawback is the cup that comes with it is the only thing it fits. I can't blend in one of my own glasses. I do love the way the mixer comes unattached from the motor for easy cleaning."
1,Worst product ever,"The first time I used this blender, I thought it was fantastic. It saved a lot of time and hassle that I was able to blend my soup right inside the pot, on the stove. I called all my family members and recommended it to them. Well, I should not have... The second time I tried to use it, approximately five weeks after the first use, it failed to work. It now sits in its box, in a cabinet at my house, because by the second use, Amazon's short return policy had alreay expired, and I would have to pay for shipping to return it. My advice is to stay away from this inferior product."
1,Lasted only 4 uses,"I own several Cuisinart items and had been satisfied with their quality, but this blender is not up to par, I only used it 4 times before and today it stopped working. The motor still runs, but the motion is not transmitted to the blade arm. I would not buy this shoddy product again and urge you not to buy it"
2,Broke in 5 weeks,"I got this, and it worked fine, however, 5 weeks after purchasing it just stopped working. The cost to S/h to Cuisinart was about %15 and that's half the product cost. Very poor customer service and product quality."
2,"Works well at first, does not last","As is the case with most product reviews on Amazon, most ratings are given based on initial results.This blender worked just fine for several months of light use, but eventually the connection between the motor and the stick/blade wears out to the point where all you get is a terrible grinding noise and a useless hunk of plastic and metal.Disappointing outcome for a Cuisinart product, no matter how affordable it was up front.If you're after a decent temporary solution or only plan to use a few times, I'm sure you'll be fine, but this blender was not engineered to last."
2,Disappointed,"The attachment comes apart while I'm using. I threw away my receipt, and am stuck with this less than expected product."
2,NOT STRONG AS BULL,THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR MILK SHAKES..PERIOD IT WON'T HANDLE CEMENT. IN OTHER WORDS THE POWER IS JUST NOT THEIR. I BOUGHT A SMALL HAMILTON MIXER AT TARGET FOR$13 THAT OUT PERFORMED THIS HAND UNIT.
1,Won't last long...,"I suppose a few of these must last for a reasonable length of time, but I really don't see how that would be physically possible."
5,A must have appliance,I love this stick blender. It is so easy to use and clean-up is a snap. I bought my sons each one and they love theirs too!
5,Awesome,"This works as advertised and more. It makes great smoothies, easily beats out regular standing blenders. Coming with the nice measuring cup was an added bonus. I got this instead of the fancy colors because of that added factor. I'm really glad I did now. It looks great and not as gaudy as some the special colors would. The cord has plenty of length. It is a breeze to clean. Once I'm done with it, I just detach the base and clean and in some soap and water. Stores nice and upright sitting in the measuring cup. Takes up very little real-estate wherever you choose to store it.Highly recommend."
5,Great item. Works well.,"I have had this for over a year and used it several times to make soups. Does what you'd expect it to do. Looks nice, built well."
5,More power,"I had an inexpensive immersion blender and I loved working with it. Now, I don't know how I managed with that older, weaker blender"
3,Excellent... until it's broken,"The first few times using this, it was excellent. It made some quick whipped cream, soup, and sauces without any issues. But the 7th or 8th time I went to use it, maybe 2 months after purchase, part of the inside was almost completely stripped, so the blade would not turn. There is a warranty on it, and I'm sure it will be taken care of without too much trouble, but I'm still a little disappointed that the number of uses didn't even break double digits before having to resort to repairs."
5,Wow,Very strong and does an amazing job. Only used it once so far but I'm impressed. It auctions so hard I can lift up the cup with it.
4,great product for the price.,"My wife loves it. It has bit of a trouble with frozen berries, other than that good product for the price."
5,Perfect,"Easy to clean and assemble, powerful and easy to use, very good product, very recommended.Cuisinart has not failed me yet."
5,does the job,Great product. One of those things you wonder how you lived without it. Arrived on time and looked just like the store models I had been looking at. So glad I finally purchased one. Multiple uses just in time for soup weather.
5,Great value for the money,"Just made soup that needed blending. Used the SmartStick instead of a regular blender. Was able to blend right in the cooking pot. Easy to use, easy to clean."
5,Great gift.,I purchased this for my brother and it was just what he wanted. The color was great and it works as promised.
2,Not smooth,This didn't make as smooth a soup as my old immersion blender so I returned it. Got the Bamix from Williams-Sonoma and love it.
5,awesome,super easy to use- though a bit scary at first. wish i used it more than i actually do. got it for a good price too!
5,Excellent blender,Ive been dying for an immersion blender for a while now since I make a ton of soups that require blending. This blender is super easy to use and clean and seems to be very sturdy and long lasting.
4,SmartStick,"I purchased this item for myself and also purchased one as a gift. I love it for making smoothies right in the container that was included with the product. It's much easier than having to clean the big blender.Cuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Brushed Chrome"
5,Finally wised up,"I make a lot of soup from scratch and was always moving from the stock pot to a blender to puree. What a colossal mess. After hemming and hawing, I finally decided to get this hand blender so I could do the same thing in the pot. What took me so long?"
4,Smart Stick Hand Blender,"Prefer using this to a conventional blender. Easy to operate, much easier to clean and takes up much less space. Great for making bisque-like soups and smoothies. Draw back was it's color. Was only available in turquoise at the time of purchase."
3,"Good, but depends on...","It is OK. But if you don't have a substantial amount of stuff to blend, it is not too efficient.If you are looking for a hand blender for baby food (small quantities) - I previously had a 300W Braun which was better."
4,Use for baby food,"I bought this after being advised that a stick blender is really good to make your own baby food. It does work well, but I found it was no better than a regular blender except that it takes less time to clean. I can see myself using it more for soups, etc. Sometimes I just wanted to make really small quantities which this cannot do, but I'm sure when my baby eats more, it'll be more useful."
3,Loved at first...but 2nd year was a disappointment,"After reviewing similar items, I chose this one - then my kids got it as a gift. I've used this regularly, but gently, to make creamed soups in the winter, salad dressings, milkshakes, etc. I'd say about 2-3 times a month which I don't think is very often. In the past few months, it's begun to make a horrible noise when the blender part is attached. Today, it started smelling and overheating with the horrible noise and it seems the blades were barely turning. Therefore, I think it's not engaging correctly. I'm going to attempt to contact Cuisinart or someone about it. Just beware that it may/may not last. I WANTED it to last and have taken good care of it!"
4,Great item,"I think this blender is wonderful. I would agree with another reviewer that I wish you did not have to hold the button in to keep it running. Otherwise, I have blended many soups and made smoothies with this and I love it. Easy to clean and compact for storage, too."
1,My mother in law almost lost her index finger,"My mother in law almost lost her index finger when she was trying to disconnect the handle from the metal stick , she erroneously pushed the start button and her index finger was cut by small pieces. It took a while in hospital to put it back. So be extra careful."
1,Blade Broke first time - stopped mashing second time,"I oredered this a few months back and used it so much - it really worked well - I would have rated it higly but when it stopped chopping well I figured I used it too much (6 months or so)and I ordered another and shortly after the blade broke inside the soup I was making for my baby. If I hadnt found the broken blade they would have swallowed it!!! I dont know if it was a one-off or what but that sure is dangerous. I havent seen a credit to my account yet, I returned the item.Wait it gets better... I ordered it again (I am editing my initial review) because the next one I got rotated but didnt mash... so I guess I am done with it. WHile it works it works well but when something goes wrong it goes awefully wrong"
4,Wonderful gadget!!,I've used this for soup and smoothies and it couldn't be easier. I love it. Easy to clean and takes up no counter space. I've made smoothies with crushed ice and it handles it fine. Don't know how I lived without it all these years!
4,Cuisinart Smartstick Blender,"I haven't actually used it in a recipe, but I like the feel of it, the weight suits me, and I look forward to using it."
3,Wrong color,"I can review this when I do use it, but was unhappy that the order clearly stated light blue and a bright green one arrived. Due to the hassle of exchange, I am keeping the green one."
5,Making baby food is a breeze!,"I bought this for making homemade baby food -- I steam veggies and fruits, then use this to puree them for freezing. The cup is just the right size to make a batch, and the hand blender is nice and quick. I also like that it's easy to clean (unlike a stand blender), and stores easily in a drawer (very handy in a smaller kitchen). I can get a batch of baby food made in minutes, and clean-up is just a minute more (quick rinse and then into the dishwasher).Other reviewers have noted how sharp the blades are and how sensitive the trigger is... I see these as good things. You definitely need to have a healthy respect for the business-end of the blender (I always unplug it before doing any scraping out with a spatula, and I disassemble completely before any washing), but when I'm using it I love how responsive and effective it is. I've been using it for a couple of months now with absolutely no problems."
3,"Love it, but not Chrome","I love this blender- I use it for salad dressing, mayo, smoothies- it's great. Easy to clean. The only complaints I have is that ""chrome"" body is gray plastic, not chrome, and it really can't handle whole ice cubes, they have to be crushed first. The other problem, which is why I can't give it more stars, is that the blade housing will scratch your pots, destroying any non-stick coating. You can't hold it up from the bottom because of the suction created by the spinning blades."
5,Such a good blender,"It's the first time for me to use hand blender. So easy,so strong and so flexible! I love it very much."
5,Makes a fine daiquiri!,I've been really happy with this. Even got rid of my blender! The detachable head makes for easy cleaning and storage.This one is a winner!
1,Broke in 6 Months--Lousy Warranty,"Boought this item based on decent reviews and nice appearance. However blender stopped spinning within 6 months and warranty service is only available for a fee. Essentially, the ""limited warranty"" requires that you ship the broken blender to Cuisinart, pay Cuisinart for a new blender and they send you one."
4,Margarita please,"I'm a single guy livin alone but love a mashed potato with my steak, way too much trouble to make till I bought this hand blender. It does a perfect job on the potato, skin and all, no lumps, no bumps. Clean up is a breeze, just dip the tip in a bowl of water and let it run a few seconds, wipe dry and your done. Makes great Margarita's too..."
3,Great while it lasted,"I loved the Cuisinart Smart Stick for the two years that it operated correctly. However, the motor just burned out and the blade doesn't spin. I'm pretty bummed out that it died after only two years. Although I should consider myself lucky considering some of the other reviews."
3,product cheaper at costco ($20 + free attachments),"I almost ordered this item from Amazon, but I read some reviews on this Amazon page about a nearly identical hand blender at Costco, so I went over to check it out. My rating here is based on price, not on the product. I did end up buying the Costco one today. It came with what appears to be this same blender (totally different item code though), a whisk attachment, and a chopper/grinder attachment. Here's the best part: from now until Jan 30, it's 10 dollars off at Costco for a total price of $19.99.I love Amazon, but if you really want this blender, I suggest you get it at Costco with extras and savings!"
4,Good device,"When you comparison shop these things, it runs the gamut. Cuisinart has always made great stuff and this does the job at a good price. Built very well, works like a champ."
2,Measuring Cup Not Included.,"Product works just fine, except that it didn't come with the measuring/blending cup. I actualy kind of need it. Ordered prime, arrived almost a week late on fedex instead of UPS. Overall displeased."
1,Plastic Stripped so Will NOT work anymore,I used this blender for 1 weekend making baby food and it crapped out. The motor is still working and the blade will still spin but where the 2 connect the plastic is stripped so will not longer work properly. I will have to toss the whole thing out as there is no fix for this. What a waste! Please save your money.
5,Great Tool,I used this for the first time today and I'm very impressed. I made a pot of Gazpacho and this pureed it in seconds. I only wanted it partly pureed but this would have done the whole pot in seconds. I normally put batches of the soup in my Cuisinart which takes time and makes a mess. This was so easy to use. Can't wait to make black bean soup next.
5,amazing!,Love it! Works well.washes easily. My best buy. makes life so easy in the kitchen. No more blending soups using the food processor.
4,Smartstick smartbuy,"Handy little blender, great for beating eggs, puree of vegetables(make sure they are well cooked). You need to have the blender completely submerged if you don't like having to clean up spatter on the wall. I especially like the quick disconnect that let's you do a quick cleanup of the blender."
5,"Use it most days, and it works great!","We use this hand blender to make baby food pretty much everyday, twice a day. We've had it for 10 months now, and it still works great! We blend a variety of steamed fruits and vegetables, and some raw. Just make sure you aren't blending plain food and that there is a decent amount of liquid for the blender to work with. If you ensure there is SOME liquid, it will blend quickly and efficiently. The bottom part pops out, too, so it's easy to clean! I've used it for making sauces and soups it big pots, too, and it works perfectly. I can't even imagine using a food processor twice a day everyday for baby food. This hand blender really makes my life easier. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!"
5,Love it,The Cuisinart Immersion blender works great! I make soups and baby food with it. It's really easy to use and the clean up is quick!
4,Hand Blender: worthful addition to any kitchen,"Hand blenders are ideal if you want to save kitchen space. Unlike the rechargeable ones i prefer the corded ones. Cuisiart has a good 200 watt corded hand blender which you can use directly in in your mixing pan or bottle. The best part, due to its slick design it reaches well into the pot of bottle you want to blend, puree or whip something up. I love the fact that it has continous constant power and 200 watts should do a great job. When the job is all done you can place the stainless stell shaft and the beaker you get with the unit in the dishwasher."
3,not as big a savings as it appears,"The blender works great. The problem is with the pricing. Amazon claims to be offering this product for 50% off the ""list price."" One kind of expects that the list price would be set by the manufacturer. But you can clearly see that this exact product, CSB-76BC, is listed on the Cuisinart web site for $29.95. This is a savings, not of 50%, but of 9%. In fact, after an extensive web search I was not able to find any retailer selling this product for $55.00 that Amazon claims is the list price."
1,Not Safe,"I've had this Cuisinart smart stick for about a year. I was always concerned by it's lack safety features, but over looked my concern because I have a small kitchen and the product is useful. After a long day I was using it to prepare dinner for my family. I had my finger near the blade and accidentally hit the light touch ""on"" button. I almost lost my finger. I strongly believe there should be a safely slide switch that needs to be activated to turn on the blade. Tired parents in hectic kitchens can make mistakes."
1,Broke-down at second use,"It broke-down at second use. It seems that the body of the machine is nice and sturdy, the motor's strong and the blades do the job nicely, the drive shaft is connected with a REALLY CHEAP PLASTIC piece. And this DID strip, and now the blades are not turning even the machine works fine."
5,Jamming Away!,I had been eyeing this little beauty for awhile and had considered asking for it for a holiday when it came up as a Lightening Deal. Bought it and then decided to make a jam for friends and family for the holiday instead. It smoothed out the apple chunks and whole cranberries with very little effort and right into the pot I was simmering away in. Was a bonus that the head detaches and can be thrown into the dishwasher! Have also used it for mashing steamed cauliflower with great success.
5,Perfect kitchen tool with very easy clean-up!,"My wife is a great cook and we are always cooking up new recipes and spend lots of time in the kitchen. I act as the sous-chef in our home and therefore do some of the prep and lots of clean-up. I bought this blender hoping it would eliminate the need for using our large food processor and/or blender when making soups, and doing other small food processor type jobs. This thing works great! We use it all the time and clean up is very fast and easy! We rarely use the big food processor or blender any longer. Wish we had bought one sooner! Thanks!"
1,Pay attention to the other 1 star reviews!!!,"I usually do a better job looking at the negative reviews before buying an item. My wife wanted this particular item so I just went ahead and ordered. Although she really likes that it can come apart for cleaning, like so many others have already said, the plastic connection has stripped making this stick blender useless. We have had it for barely over 2 months (it does...or should I say 'did' get used almost daily). Since it is past Amazon's 30 days, I am now stuck waiting on Cuisinart's customer service to deal with this. Estimated wait time on a Thursday night? 10 minutes. Yippie. My wife has searched the other similar products and NONE get real high marks all around. I guess she goes back to the one piece she has had for years and years. Stands up, but hard to clean."
5,Love this!,I love this mixer! It has made cooking a whole lot easier. Better than using a blender. I would definitely recommend this!
4,I like it,"Works fine, this can make milk shakes or soup. Runs on electricity from a plug, so is not battery operated"
4,excellent product,"This Smart Stick is a great product. The only thing I would change is having a low setting option. I really like the measuring cup that accompanies the purchase, too."
5,Works great!,"No complaints! I use this to make smoothies every morning, and it works great. Because the bottom section comes off, it's easy to clean, too. Love it!"
5,Works great!,"This Cuisnart SmartStick hand blender works great! It is easy to use and clean! It was shipped quickly! Fun color, too!"
5,Great item!!!,This is my second hand blender and my first Cuisinart. I only wish I had found this one my first time around. It is a great multi-purpose blender and very easy to clean and care for. I love the measuring cup that comes with it which gets used for shakes nearly every day. The colors are fun and the pricing is excellent. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
5,Totally satisfied with the SmartStick hand blender,"Totally satisfied with the SmartStick hand blender. Efficient results, easy to use and a breeze to clean! So happy we purchased this and less expensive than many others. Appreciated the rapid shipping, too."
3,Works decent enough but gets really hot!,"I used this to make the kids ice cream malts..I was making three of them, and by the end of the third I had to stop to turn it off and give my hand a break as the base of the machine had gotten very hot. I don't know if others have experienced this or not. Between each malt I made, I had the blender turned off for approx 1-2 minutes, so it wasn't in consistent use for 3 malts. Anyway, it worked well, didn't take long at all to make them and they were a wonderful consistency."
4,Blending was a breeze!,I used this to help me with my stuffing for my turkey since the kids don't like big pieces of onion and celery in it. It basically pureed them in only 10 seconds.
3,Cuisinart SmartStick Blender,The product is slightly awkward to hold & blend while pushing the ON button. Also it does not blend as easily as advertised.
5,great for soup,Great for making soup! It makes a great gift. You have to keep it immersed though and be careful to use it in a larger container than the measuring cup thing that it comes with.
3,Only washable part is made from metal,"Carefull, contrary to what the pictures make you believe, only the washable part is made from metal and easy to clean. The handle is made from plastic and will age accordingly (dirt, bacteria, wathever). On the good part, product is light and potency is adequate to what you want it to do."
4,Fairly good.,I am glad that I bought this because it has speeded up the pureeing process for me. It doesn't blend as fast as I thought it would based off of the other reviews but I am pleased with the product.
4,Nothing fancy but it works.,"I had checked out some reviews of other, more fancier with more attachment, hand blenders. There seemed to be a general low rating on them. This did not have all the attachments, though it does the job. It would have been nice if the chopper part, which is dish washer safe, was better disigned to let the water drain out of it somehow."
3,Loved it until it broke,This blender worked great for about 1 1/2 years using it about three times a week for smoothies and soup. The blade no longer turns fast enough to blend and the motor sounds like it is struggling. It is still under warranty however Cuisinart requires $10 for shipping a new one out and you are also required to pay for return shipping of the defective blender. It may be more cost efficient to buy a new one - at least you get a new 3 warranty though the warranty does not mean much.
2,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!!,"I have had this blender (Cuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender) for about 8 months and have used it a couple of times per week. It did a great job blending things that were not too firm (like frozen berries) or too large (big pieces of banana). If large or firm items were in the blending cup, the motor really struggled and there was a faint burning smell. So, I used only crushed ice and made sure the items I put in it weren't very big. If I did those 2 things, it made great smoothies. I usually washed it by hand. But yesterday I was in a hurry so I put it in the dishwasher on the normal cycle. Should not have been a problem since the product description states it is dishwasher safe. The plastic parts on the blending shaft melted. The warped plastic no longer fits on the blender, so it is now useless. Such a shame; I really liked this blender!"
4,Great so far!,"I've had this blender for about five months and it's been great so far. It's clearly not for ""heavy duty"" work, but it's great for completing quick, simple blending jobs with minimal mess (which is most of the blending jobs I ever need to do, myself). I heeded the other reviews and got some of the sturdier metal blending cups to use instead of the plastic one that's included (never even bothered using it with the blender, so it's made a great measuring cup, instead!)."
2,doesn't last long,"i was happy in the beginning. but after few months of use, the blades broke while i was blending onion! the worse thing is i tried to contact Cuisinart for buying the part. the company did not even answer. now i wonder if there is a place i can buy part?"
4,Much easier than the Oster $20 one...,"OK, so I'll keep this short. I can't speak for how long this will last, nor how long the Oster will last.(I borrowed the Cuisinart one and just bought the Oster one.)**This Cuisinart SmartStick is MUCH easier to use than the Oster one. Even if they both break after one year, it's worth paying the extra $15 for the Cuisinart because it handles so much better. The Oster one has WAY too much suction and it's like trying to ride a rodeo bull. The Cuisinart is SMOOTH and lighter weight.**"
4,Save the Big Mixer,"Bought this to save dragging out the big mixer all the time. Works very well for mashed potatos, cake mixes, etc. Just wish it had two speeds. Very happy with it though."
5,WOW,"This is a wonderful kitchen aid. We live in Oregon so I make loads of soups. It is a real time saver to puree them in the cooking pot, instead of having to put them in the blender in batches, which always makes a mess. It also works great for salad dressings, and makes delicious homemade mayonaise."
5,good little blender,"easy to clean. easy to use. blends smooth.I would say to parents, please be careful, this would be so easy for a child to get really badly hurt."
5,haven't put it away yet!,"I ordered this after seeing Emeril make a soup where he used an immersion blender. Having only used a regular blender in the past for pureeing soups (and avoiding making them because of the hassle!)I ordered this immersion blender. I LOVE IT!! It literally has been sitting on my countertop ever since...I use it everyday. It makes easy work of my morning shakes (right in the included plastic container) despite using frozen bananas and other frozen fruits. And I use it at least weekly to make one soup or another. It cleans up easily and is nice looking too. I've read where some complain about the ""cheap plastic teeth"" at the connection of blades to handle, but if you attach/detach carefully (and always use the special button for it) I don't foresee any problem with the construction. I can't believe I've waited this long to add an immersion blender to my kitchen repertoire...I doubt I'll be pulling out that cumbersome, loud, hard-to-wash freestanding blender anymore!!"
5,"Excellent blender, great value","This immersion blender is easy to use and easy to clean. It makes including more fruits and veggies in your diet tasty and simple. Smoothies are a snap ans easily converted into a delicious and even (possibly) nutritious evening cocktail. The variations are endless. You can make ""cream"" soups without the cream. I have used it almost every day since it was delivered. I never owned a stick immersion blender before, but it sure beats a traditional blender when it time to clean up"
4,"Great, especially for the price.","Great blender at a great price. It is as powerful as commercial models. However, it doesn't have variable speeds, just on off. So you have to be very careful or you will make a big mess."
2,fake stainless steel,"surprise! After all the stainless steel cuisinart smart stick hand blender, turned out to be gray plastic. Something I wouldnot be proud to work with around company."
1,Don't waste your $$,"Yeah the colors are pretty & they come with awesome variety, HERE IS THE CATCH LOOK BEYOND THE PRETTY COLORS & STURDY CHROME FIXINGS the motor connects to the base with a cheap plastic piece that strips too easy...leaving you with a pretty colored piece of crap & its sold by Amazon, so you get a partial refund minus shipping and you eat the cost of shipping it back to them"
2,Outdated,"This book may have been eye opening for its time, but only the frame work of the problems listed are actually still relevant. The book criticizes cities for issues that are present throughout the world in areas of all populations and development. Most of the examples are outdated and give modern readers a false sense of our current environment. The book often exaggerates and offer few feasible solutions to the problems it presents."
1,Egomaniac's Experiment,"It has taken me a while to get to this review because I so disliked the book, I wanted to get some (hopefully) cogent thoughts together. This may have been an experiment on the writer's part, or perhaps plain ego alone. Either way, it failed miserably.The jacket relates that the author was self-taught in the classics. He decided to show off all he learned in grossly overwritten prose throughout two-thirds of the book.The other third is written in gross language. He makes himself the protagonist/hero, yet you never get to know what kind of man that character is - except ego driven in fiction as well.The plot had potential, as did the underlying theme of Dante's soul-searching and difficulties writing his classic. None of it came off, however.Perhaps the best part was a thirty page diatribe about the publishing industry.If ever a book was ""jus' showin' off"" this was it. I am sorry so much potential was wasted."
1,Too vindictive for me,"Sorry, I couldn't make it past author's tirade about the decline of the publishing industry. Everything he says is probably true, but why does this have to be inflicted on his readers, who are supposedly paying him for the privilege of reading his work? And why does he in fact include his readers in his tirade? I say right back to you, Nick Tosches, ""F**k you!""."
3,"great at times, bad at others, i don't understand the ending","I have Tosches to thank for my love of emmett miller and a new respect of jerry lee lewis. This book is a brave attempt at something larger and more literary than a biography of a musician but it doesn't work very well. Sometimes the flowery passages inmedieval Italy are beautiful and poetic, sometimes they suck like high school verses. His publisher rant is funny and true. However, it is ironic that he ends with the demand for no more editing of his books when that is EXACTLY what this book needed; a good editor."
3,not a bad bit of reading,"In the Hand of Dante is a decent enough book. It's major faults, in my opinion, lie in the first half of the book, where it seems that the author hadn't much direction in which to take his characters. Indeed, even their relationship to each other is extremely slow in being presented. I found myself often wondering more about why the characters were doing what they were, rather than looking forward to their actions.Stylistically, however, it is obvious that the author is a fantastic wordsmith. He is very skilled at writing in the style of the time, place and point of view.All in all, this wasn't a bad book, though it wasn't a great one either. I don't know that I would ever really recommend it to anyone. However, I don't regret having read it, so I guess I wouldn't suggest avoiding it either."
2,"Tosched by your presence, dear","Nick Tosches has never been an author to underestimate his own considerable abilities. But here he swerves dangerously into Hunter Thompson parody territory by making himself the lead in what could have been a fascinating rumination on the title character, and then digressing with a silly screed lambasting the publishing industry (probably lifted verbatim from the memos about this book). Stick with his biographies (especially ""Dino"") and music criticism unless you still think swearing profusely in every sentence is the stylistic mark of a hard-bitten alcoholic mess of a middle-age hero (cue Ozzy)."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"This book is crazy. There is way too much usage of the ""F"" word; which if appropriate in establishing something w/in the book, I am fine with, but there did not seem to be a good reason for the constant profanity. The author is constantly berating the reader and anyone else he can think of. While reading the book, I felt angry. If there was something in the book of merit to make me feel anger, I would not have a problem with that.There does not seem to be a plot and it is very hard to follow where it may be heading. The previous commentary was very diplomatic about the first half of the book. I on the other hand suggest this book be avoided.This is my first and last Nick Tosches book."
1,I did not make it past 30 pages,"Without repeating what everyone else has said, I think the only thing that needs to be said is that this writing style is definately not to my taste. Frankly, reading it felt like the equivalent of slogging through heavy mud and did not feel worth the effort."
1,An incredible waste of paper and ink,"The potential for a great story was there - Vatican intrigue, Dante's struggles, corrupt publishers, and a protagonist you love to hate. But the writing was too forced. Almost as if Tosches was following his self-taught method to write a classic - one part obscure latin, a dash of self-loathing, a healthy pinch of angst, and a healthy use of a thesaurus. After all, why just tell a story when one can spin a yarn, weave a tale, narrate an adventure, pontificate, illuminate, elucidate and enlighten."
1,It hurt... It really hurt!,"Try as I might, there was simply no getting through this horrid book! Encouraged by a promising description, I bought it in an airport, thinking it would be a good way to pass the time in my travels. I can understand instances where profanity and utter nastiness can have literary merit, though in this work they were simply egregious. It was almost as though Tosches was simply trying to be profane for sheer shock value. After suffering through a number of chapters, I left my new ... hardback on the airplane for the next poor soul who happened upon it. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,So bad that I couldn't finish it,"This is quite likely the worst book I have ever read. The premise on the dust cover is quite promising, but Nick Tosches couldn't fulfill it. Perhaps an author who is less in love with himself could write a good story with the same premise. I really tried to work my way through this mess, but I eventually had to give up about half way through. I couldn't stand the punishment anymore. You can sense the fact that there is a story to be told but you cannot get past the author's pompus, self absorbed style to find it."
2,Rampant Ego Obscures Talent,"Nick Tosches undeniably has talent. Unfortunately for the reader, Tosches is very aware of this fact and wants the reader to be aware of it (the book refers to Tosches' ""legendary"" poetry readings!). A series of riffs on truly tangential subjects (e.g., the woeful state of publishing in America today) undermines what could have been a great story. When Tosches focuses on the task at hand, the book is gripping, and the sentences sing (sometimes with melancholy beauty, other times raging jazz, and still other passages sound like a dirge). But the sheer weight of Tosches' ego overwhelms all.The modern story of Nick's verification of Dante's original manuscript is far more engaging than the parallel story of Dante actually writing his masterwork. Rather than building to a crescendo, this book also trails off towards the end, giving the impression that Tosches merely lost interest in his tale. And by then, so had I."
2,Tosches' Silly Mess,"After being both bored and confused by this novel, I feel Nick should stick to biography. A no velist he is not,no idea of structure,inability to decide who he really wants to be,the use of scatalogy for shock value alone,and the psuedo Faulknerian ramblings make this a mockery of solid literature.Buy Dino."
4,Tosches does'nt care what you think,"C'mon people Nick Tosches is one of the most real writers of our day. He does not care about these reviews, he writes for the demon inside. It is in all of us, he is the only one who is not afraid to let it out."
3,"Radiantec, just not radiant.","What can I say? I am, to say the least, mildly disappointed. I suppose perhaps my expectations were too high after the marvelous black that Radiantec was able to pull off (with help from EPSON...see my other review), but somehow the magenta just doesn't measure up. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but could Radiantec (should be UNRadiantec) be spending their R&D; dollars on cyan?It may seem trivial to most but having an accurate (and yes, radiant) representation of magenta matters to me when I am adjusting the tint on my pictures of Ruby (my cocker spaniel). I don't know, if it's just me I'll shut up."
4,An excellent piece on the theory of domination,"This book was recommended to me by a history professor at the school I currently attend. He introduced this piece as a work that he enjoys using in his environmental history class. At the surface level, this work gives an excellent examination of the dominance of the human subject within its environment. The writing is very clear and often playful and clever. But there is another trend within this book that makes it personally very interesting to my studies, and that is an examination concerning the mechanisms and structures of domination as that which is something fundamentally other than power. Thus in many ways this works seems to complement the theoretical framework established by Foucault in his studies on power. I highly recommend this book to any reader interested in human relationships with the world or anyone interested in the environment and the human position therein."
4,conoce a Alberto Fuguet,"Desde que descubri a Alberto Fuguet no he parado de leerlo! pero si no lo conoces ""cortos"" es una buena manera de conocerlo pues en este libro nos da una probadita de su estilo y versatilidad. Pero mi favorito sigue siendo ""Las peliculas de mi vida"". En mi opinion Fuget va un paso adelante en la literatura latina, un genio!Me encanta porque es latino (como yo) y ha vivido en USA (como yo), te transmite ese sentimiento de doble cultura, nostalgia y gusto de vivir lejos de casa. LEAN TODOS SUS LIBROS!!!, es adictivo, quiero mas!!"
2,"Cheap, Decent, but Nothing Special","I got this as a gift for a friend, choosing it as the least expensive hair dryer available on Amazon. When I visited him recently, I had a chance to use it myself.It's compact in that it is rather small, but it does not fold up so is not the best choice for travel. It's not that much smaller than a typical dryer, anyway. It feels decently solid, not like a cheap piece of garbage, but it's also not very powerful. I'm no expert on the wattage of hair dryers, but it took significantly longer to dry my hair than it does at home, and I was shivering most of the time.If you have very thick hair that you regularly dry, or you need a portable dryer for travel, this is not for you. If you're a man and just need something for occasional light drying (or want to impress females that stay over, maybe?), this is a functional choice at the best price. However, it might be even cheaper and certainly easier to just go buy a cheap one in a store."
5,"Very, Very Nice.","I am a big fan of The Hollies, I own quite a few cd's from the band. Along with a nice cd package, this cd really sounds great. It has depth and clarity, plus a nice song selection."
5,Great Band,"Here is a band that produced alot of good songs.There is alot of songs on this disk that are well known,and still get alot of radio play today.The name was influenced from Buddy Holly.They certainly did have one hell of alot of hits this band.Bus Stop ,Carrie-Anne ,Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress ,Sorry Suzanne ,I'm Alive ,Dear Eloise ,and a personal favorite He Ain't Heavy...He's My Brother ,Just One Look ,On A Carousel ,and in my opinion the best song of all The Air That I Breathe,i just love that tune."
5,Reducing Plan Works!,"As a Certified Financial Planner, I am always on the lookout for effective, easy-to-follow money management ideas for my clients. Stanley Kershman has written a book that is a ""good read."" It can be read chapter by chapter or all at once (it is hard to put down!) Well laid out, each chapter has helpful hints in bold boxes and ends with a concise, numbered summary. Kershman has touched on all the real-life financial circumstances that ordinary people find themselves in and he has suggested ways to navigate successfully through the occasional rough spots. Although he practises bankruptcy and insolvency law, Kershman has shown how people can avoid becoming his clients! After reading this book, everyone should sit down, make a list of things to do, and perhaps top that list with ""Find a Financial Planner."""
4,the beginning of greatness,"i was once asked to describe tortoise's sound. tortoise's sound is...well...THE tortoise sound. there is really no words to describe. their sound is distinctively their own. melodic, dreamlike and original are three adjectives i would use to describe this album. does this album, in it's entire form, match that of ""millions..."" or ""TNT""? no. but it does show the musicianship and experimentation from the early stages. for me the bass stands out the most especially on my favorite track (which happens to be my favorite tortoise track ever) ""tin cans and twine."" to me nothing takes me on a dreamlike journey such as this song.This album is also the perfect ""late night"" album. you know, the one you put on right after a long day or after a show when you just want to wind down and relax. this is absolute perfection for those moments...and other times as well."
3,Crawling into their own,"3 1/2An album which may have more historical significance than actual content, especially given artistic heights the band would come into once they got out of their shell. This comparatively bare-bones approach comes complete with most elements we would admire from them, but merely lays out the blueprint in off-beat styled, bass-heavy jams with enough underlying brilliance to guarantee future success."
3,"Good, but inconsistent","While I don't think Tortoise is a below-average album, I must say that it simply does not find its way into my CD player very often. There's nothing on here as compelling as their later work on Millions Now Living Will Never Die and TNT. This self-titled debut seems more experimentally-oriented.This is still a worthwhile disc, though, especially if you like Tortoise' other stuff - but be warned, it's not nearly as organized as TNT. ""Night Air"" is a favorite, it's very chill for lack of a better word. This album gains some focus towards the end with tracks like ""Spiderwebbed"" and ""Cornpone Brunch.""Overall Tortoise is decent, worthwhile, but not amazing. In their defense I've never really heard anything like this, so it's definitely original, but like I said not particularly compelling."
2,Eh.,"This is a disservice to Tortoise only because it's so highly rated. I'd have more to say about this album if there WAS more of an album to say things about. It doesn't succeed in being minimalist, and 'ambient rock' is too generous a term. There's just not much of anything going on here. It sounds like a promising high school drum and bass duo who got some of their friends together and did a few weed-infused weekend recording sessions. If you let it be a simple first-outing low-budget indie rock exploration, it's alright. I've had some nice times around the house with it on in the background.""Cornpone Brunch"" is a decent track. It's the only one that gives any glimpse of the skill and creativity the band would come to achieve. If you're a Tortoise fan and want to explore their complete discography, you'll probably be interested in this album simply to witness them in an embryonic state. If you're anyone else, don't bother at all with this album and go straight for one of their later offerings."
4,"Instrumental soundscapes. Lotsa bass guitar, groovy drums","Weird in places (Onions wrapped in rubber) boppy in others, very melodious at some points. Number 3 is by far the best track on the CD. Nicely offbeat and safely in Obscuresville. More please, I loved it."
5,The lost city,"Very interesting movie about the Castro take over in Cuba,picture and audio were excellent as was the actual music itself."
2,HORRIBLE YELLOWED Pages,"The information is good, BUT I DESPISE / DREAD reading on this horrible yellowed paper. It is inexcuseable to avoid clean white paper with solid dark font; enhancing reading.Even with a bright desk light, I get a headache reading this book. I typically read a 200-300 page book in 1 - 2 hrs; I like to read.Why did the authors and/or publishers ruin this book by making it pages Yellowed?VERY Dissappointed!!!!!!!"
2,For the European Audience,"This book is not appropriate for anyone seeking knowledge of hotel development in the United States. The authors are British and the book is written for the European audience. The U.S. reader is not even extended the courtesy of dual imperial and metric measures; room dimensions are in meters and financial figures are presented in pounds. In addition, many of the cited references are dated, the graphics are hard to read, and the book is cheaply printed."
3,Sleep Will Return,"I would recommend this addition for any Clark fan. There is one song , Sleep Will Return"", that's worth the price of admission. Why some country singer doesn't latch on to this one must be only due to not knowing of it. He has 3 veterans , Rick Danko, John York and Nicky Hopkins, plus others I'm not familiar with. He has a collaborater , Pat Robinson, who cowrote most tracks."
4,Gene Clark - Under the silvery moon,"The record is still great, but where is the 2CD set with 29 tracks that was announced and that I've bought in a regular record shop ?"
5,awesome new york salsa sound!,"THERE IS A LOT THAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT ONE OF THE BEST GROUP OF MUSICIANS IN THE HISTORY OF SALSA FROM NY. THIS IS AN ALBUM THAT COLLECTS ALL THE RIGTH CARACTERISTICS TO DO SO. IF YOU LIKE TO DANCE, BUT ALSO LIKE A GREAT JAM, THIS IS THE RIGTH MUSIC AND IS THE REAL FLAVOR OF THE GRAT TALENT OF THE PUERTORICAN MUSICIANS."
5,A Sacred Text of Entrepreneurship,This is the one book to have if you're starting a company. Theexamples are very dated but the content is timeless - and dead on themoney.
2,Stalin's Fake Polar Flights of the 1930's,"Few polar historians or academics are aware of the late Robert J. Morrison's 1987 exposure of Stalin's North Pole scam of the 1930's, in ""Russia's Shortcut to Fame: 50-Year Hoax Exposed."" Morrison researched from previously classified US Army documents and photographic evidence that the so-called record setting flights originated from remote islands of the Alaskan panhandle to Vancouver, WA and San Jacinto, CA, not from Moscow as Stalin wanted the world to believe. Also Levanevsky was not lost in the Arctic, but was a victim of Stalin's great paranoid 1937 purge"
4,True old skool...,"This cd brings back memories. I was pleasantly surprised by several tunes whose titles I didn't recognize. But, when I heard the songs I was glad I made this purchase. This truly is the real '70's old skool. That ""Cooley High"" flava'."
4,Propaganda movie,"I wanted to see this top example of Propaganda, which it was - but also i was surprised at the good acting and interesting story line. well worth viewing for propaganda students."
5,Jud Suss Review,"I was delighted to find this historic movie. Having heard about it for years as I've studied WW II and Nazi Germany history, it was a valuable experience. Unbelievable what propaganda Goebbles and the Nazi's went to. Serious students of history should see this."
4,Jud Suss,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
5,Evil Themes. Excellent Movie Making,"The movie's themes are hideous and repulsive.The following, however, are outstanding: acting (wow), setting, costumes, story-telling, and directing. This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.The subtitles are fine, and the quality film in the restored version is rather good.Overall, a masterpiece."
4,"Night of the Grizzly, Unforgiven, Open Range: Western Trifecta","OK, so many have written the proper testimonials for The Night of the Grizzly that my words may be redundant. Here it is...Loved it in the late 1960s and loved it all over again 2012!!! A great balance of western drama! Has good guys, lovable guys, bad guys and a real NASTY BEAR! Still a bit expensive but worth it...they just don't seem to make'em like this very often anymore. DON""T MISS IT!"
2,buyer beware,"The Blue-ray disc from Olive Films is clear, but very dirty. The sparkly's, dust, occasional scratch etc. are so thick that it is like looking through them to see the movie. This is presented in a wide screen format - not really, it is cropped to appear wide screen so you have missing content like mountain tops chopped off, and standing people chopped at the knee. This movie is based on the true story of Old Mose, a bear(s) who terrorized ranchers in the South Park region of Colorado. As other reviewers have commented, this is an excellent movie. In Night of the Grizzly we see people as beasts, beasts as people, and a co-mingling of interaction between the two only rarely seen on film. Great movie but marginal product that is disappointing at $27."
5,Night of the Grizzly,While the bear special effect definitely needed help it's a pretty fantastic movie for the whole family. Definitely one of those types of movies that you remember from your childhood and want desperately. It was definitely worth purchasing and my kids love it.
5,great old classic movie,"does show animals killed--bit in general is a good movie from the older days--good acting and great wholesome show, price is worth it"
3,Night of the Grizzly,This product needs to be subtitled or closed cationed. The remaining quality of the movie is well presented and entertaining.
4,If you like Cheyenne--,"I am a fan of Clint Walker and the Cheyenne TV series. This movie is one of his best in the Western style. I like to think of it as beyond Cheyenne. If there was a continuation of the story of Cheyenne Bodie, this would probably be it. Cheyenne married, a father, and trying to settle down into ranching life, but nature and his earlier life catching up with him. The scenery is beautiful. The casting is familiar, including Leo Gordon and Jack Elam. And Clint Walker even gets to sing. A well done, enjoyable movie."
5,An Excellent Famly Western Movie,"This is one of Clint Walker's best films. Walker portrays Big Jim Cole, a retired Sheriff who brings his family to a new life on a new ranch. But, a local killer Grizzly Bear has other plans when he continues to kill off Jim's livestock. The hunt for the bear is exciting and there are a few good laughs in it as well. Also good supporting performances by Jack Elam, Ellen Corby(Grandma on the Waltons), Ron Ely(T.V.'s Tarzan) and Keenan Wynn. The location where the movie was filmed, the San Bernardino National Forest, is beautiful. A great family film."
3,Not too bad,"I found it very entertaining, and not hard to learn at all. I was entertained, and it went rather quickly.My only gripe is at the end, when your answering questions to race to the finish line, basically once one person gets a question right everyone else can just choose the same answer, like looking over someones shoulder. Maybe they should all get different questions or something, to make it a bit more fair."
4,draciel-s rocks,"hi this is sushil. now draciel is the best endurance even though some people think spark night. I'm a member of the blade wolves and we all have a dragoon weight disc . Our leader has a gold one . so I added that weight disc on draciel and it spin for 1:42! of course my leaders blade(dranzer attack ring,gold dragoon weight disc and wolborg base)spins for 2:47! but i still beat his blade by 5 seconds this draciel kicks ..."
3,a must-cusrtomize bey,"i bought it only three days ago and i found that it is very weak if it is not customized, i maintain the same bottom but i add an extra weight balance ring and now it is a fortress it can stay in field for 3 minutes and more"
4,Draciel S is da BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!,"Alright, this is the best defensive blade, if you can find it, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!! It is also a nice endurance blade. I am looking for more people in the Downingtown-Exton area who like Beyblades so I can get a team going. PEACE OUT!"
4,So-So....,"This is a good defense type.It has a great attack ring for both attack and defense.It might say 4 stars for endurance for the base, but trust me it doesn't stay up long.It's because of the attack ring.Again this is a great defense, but I'd rather get Galman."
4,Driger M (mixed),Use a Master Dragoon attack ring and waight disk .DrigerF base and bit. Every bit of the beyblade is mega heavey!Because of this it will smash blades out of the arena!And it will have exelent balence!This is the best blade you can make!
5,metal bearing defense,This is the best defense beyblade I have ever seen(besides galman)the blade base is highly defensive.It also has 1 ball bearing in each side for better balance and wieght.the wieght disk has good endurance and average defense.the attack ring is great for attack or defence it depends on the spin direction.
5,Draciel S defense,This is the greatest blade. This was my first blade ever. i trained it alot and its pretty good...im still a rookie blader but i hope to start a team and become a master. P.S rip draciel S in a 45 degree angle ...
1,Draciel S - it's terrible,"Definitely don't get this blade. I just got it yesterday and it can't win. No matter how much I customise it, it can't withstand any attack; it gets hit a few times and down it goes. One of the metal balls (ball bearings) even came out of its slot while Draciel was spinning."
4,"Families of County Kerry, Ireland: Over Four Thousand Entries from the Archives of the Irish Genealogical Foundation","I do recommend this publication to anyone who is researching for ancestors in County Kerry, Ireland. The book was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner."
2,"Too much information, no direction","Though this book is packed with facts and surname family histories, it leaves one wondering what to do with all that information. I got lost in the vast amounts of information that has no key to finding it's source or how to apply it to my current research. It would have been to the readers advantage if this book was written to inform rather than impress."
4,"A thoughtful, moving memoir","Long out of print, Senator Daniel Inouye's memoir is one of those hidden gems about life before, during, and after World War II, especially for Japanese-Americans. His first-hand accounts of the attack on Pearl Harbor (he was a young Red Cross aide at the time), his years in the 442nd fighting the Germans, his struggles to return to a normal life after losing his arm in battle, his ultimate success in politics, are, dare I say inspiring. This is an amazingly honest, warts and all look--especially for a politician. If you want to know what really happened to the Japanese-Americans who fought so bravely in World War II, this is one of the books to get."
5,Early Flight Experimentation,"This is one of those lovely books which can be independently read by ages 9-12, or read aloud to the whole family.Alberto Santos-Dumont spent his youth in Brazil and adult life in Paris France. He was heavily involved in early flight experimentation, being both an aviator and inventor. For a time he was the most famous person in early 20th Century France. It is an eye-opener to find out about flight experimentation in another country.This is a well-done biography with a scientific bent."
1,wrong shades,I ordered these & got sent the wrong one's so sent them back & ordered a diff set & still got the wrong one so im not ordering another set
2,different from pic,The book was not like the one in the pic. It was a normal paperback. Wish they would update teh pic. I mean it's still the same book.
5,The canonical critic,"if there is a samuel johnson living among us, he is probably harold bloom. i loved to find my favourite writers in his book. and, being a portuguese, i can only tank him for including Fernando Pessoa among the 26 geniuses he selected."
4,book learnin',"I've owned this book for about two years and I keep coming back to it for encouragement. Like (I expect) most people who buy this book, I was already pretty much sold on the idea of ""great books"" and secretly wanted someone to sell it to me harder. This book, like all of Bloom's books I've read, delivers all the sales pitch I desire and then some. Whenever I get bored out of my skull by Joyce or any of the others, I turn to The Western Canon for fresh prodding. Oh yeah, and some of the criticism is pretty illuminating too, though I can't say I follow more than about 50 percent of it. Sometimes Bloom makes me feel like I'll never be able to understand anything I read without reading 30 other books first. Once in a while, he mentions a work that I've actually read and I get all warm and learned feeling."
4,Classic Criticism from a great critic,"A refutation to all those who claim there is no canon. There is, and Harold Bloom is here to show us what it contains. Bloom is erudite, witty, pointed, and forceful. The book reader in me loved his complete listing if the Canon in one of the appendices. A large book, to be read slowly, but with a great deal of weight behind its premise"
3,A wrong turn by a great man,"Harold Bloom took a wrong turn in this book, pandering to an imagined audience of ""general readers' that was really a fantasy of his publishers. Thisbook was primarily read and discussedby literature professors, some ofwhom, surprisingly, didn't dislike it. Harold Bloom is one of thegreat critics and great men of our time. His earlier books, particularly those published in the 1970's and 1980's, are well worth reading. Bloom has always stood for the right things, and he should be thanked for that."
3,The school of Bloom,"Critical intelligence is always inversely proportional to age and fame. Bloom was quite good in his early days, when he was an unestablished fighter for the Romantics; now he mainly babbles and parodies himself. All of his recent books are badly in need of a real editor, who can with the severity of a schoolteacher tell him straight out to delete and revise. Bloom ought to stop reading his great authors, and pick up an elementary style manual. He is a gifted man, with real strengths as a critic in the tradition of Johnson; and it is a pity that he should waste away his talent and the rain forest like this."
1,Establishment Refuse,"If this were my fist intoduction to ""literature"" I would despise it forever. Where is Jack Kerouac?"
1,R.I.P.,"What the Frank E. Browns and Booklist Inc.'s perceive as a must read {and those who comprehend their mumbling}is actually the mold slowly spreading over academic ""literary"" prescriptions. But nothing could save this ponderous & vain brick."
1,Joke,"Just one question: where is T.S.Eliot?.Hate this book.Bloom is not a serious critic and if you want one, i can give you now: T.S.ELIOT. End of story. Hell, The Western Canon without Eliot?Hahaha"
2,Prententious,"I saw Harold Bloom on ""Charlie Rose"" and he came across as a vain man, with contrived dourness to seem ""artistic."" And all I could think was, ""It doesn't work if you're not an artist."" Critics become critics to cling peripherally to the arts, and sometimes make the mistake of thinking they are artists themselve. From reading the prose in this book, Bloom never could have written a sonnet or short story worth a damn. And he's so in love with his own opinions! This book is good just to look at for the list of important works (although some items I don't think should be on the list...What in God's name is Gore Vidal doing on it! Ugh! ). But I read Harold Bloom, and get the same feeling when I watch Keanu Reeves in a movie: ""What in God's name is THIS person doing at the top of their professional heap. There has to be better people out there! "" In the world of MTV and computer games, any encouragement for people to read literature is great. I just wish it had been delivered differently."
2,Sad,"Harold Bloom has finally buried himself in his own academic babble. Nonesense begets nonesense in this book and Bloom fights straw men of his own making while never really giving a solid, well-reasoned aesthetic to base his rant upon.As a professional writer with 54 hour minor in English, I find this book a great disappointment for it neither defends, explains, nor promotes the canon of great literature in any clear or reasonable way. It is sad to see a once sharp mind so lost in itself like this.I gave the book two stars because it does serve to stire up the conversation about great books, thus does make a valuable contribution in that light. It does little else."
3,Nickson just doesn't cut it,"Nickson, the author, doesn't cut to the chase right away in the biography of Mariah Carey. He starts of talking about her ""Cindrella"" lifestyle and then smoothly carries the reader away into statistics that bore. The facts on Ms. Carey are fairly accurate. Yet it's just not enough to interest Non-Mariah spectators."
2,A collection of articles written about the Princess of Pop,"Although I have had this book for a while, I still think about the poor trees that had to die in vain for this ""book"". Every word written in Her Story came from either magazines or newspaper articles and it shows. There are many contradictions in the book, misinformation, and at some points the author can't even spell Mariah's name correctly! I would not recommend this book for an avid fan of Mariah's, as they most likely have the articles contained in the book. I would possibly recommend it to a new fan who doesn't know much about Mariah, but wants to"
2,Does this do Justice?,"As a fan of Mariah Carey for about 8 years now, I wonder why a book like this can be written. It is completely filled with information that was taken from articles and interviews. There is really nothing knew to learn about here. The pictures are in black and white and are also taken from published articles. Although it does offer information on the qween, I am positive I could have written something much more representative of her. Its nice to add to your collection but the content is not all that great. Read it and see for yourself......"
2,Not that great.,"Well, ok if you DONT know much about Ms. Carey then yeah it *sort-of* has info about her in it, but its only up to 1993 and a LOT has happened since then!! COME ON SHE NEEDS A DIFFERENT BIOGRAPHY! and by an author thats not going to mess up her bday, name and punctuation in the book.. geez ppl.. ever heard of something called EDITORS!??!?! The book isnt great for a fan - just someone who might want to know a litte (VERY little) more about her.."
2,review about mariah carey; her story,"im a big mariah fan, and prior to reading the book, i knew all the information in it. it wasn't anything special that most fans dont know already. i wrote a research paper on mariah for school, it had to be at least 20 pages typed, and i'd say my paper is better then the book. i wouldnt recommend this book to her die-hard fans, i'd recomend it to people who know little on mariah, and want to learn about her. the pictures werent any good either."
2,Author was very ill-informed,"It was obvious from the first couple of sentences, that the author wasn't on top of things when it came to reporting about Mariah. His first mistake was getting a simple fact like her BIRTHDAY wrong! I was left sceptical about how much he actually researched for the book. As a MAJOR MAJOR fan of hers, this really irked me. I was hoping to find out something about my mentor that I didn't have access to learning. No such luck. Most of the book was a repeat of articles written on her by other journalists.The book was very positive for Mariah. The few photos that were included were beautiful!For those that don't know much about Mariah, I would say this is a good book to start out with, but do something the author didn't do...research what is being said. Read another book on her, go find another article on her, you'll find that some links were missed."
1,....i don't know what to say,"wow, i really don't recommend this to anyone.. at all. being a devoted fan for 6 years, there was nothing new to learn about mariah in this book. most of the information was taken from articles ive already read and no previously unvisited aspects of her life were discussed in this book.. i could have read this biography and a student's school essay about mariah and there would not be a difference."
3,Was somewhat disappointed...,"While this book offers some good advice for handling RAW format photos, I found it to be quite repetitive. Very often, the author makes a point in an opening chapter, then repeats the very same point with little elaboration in later chapters. Also, I was disappointed that the photos used in the exercises are neither included on a CD with the book, nor are available for downloading at the publisher's or auther's site. That makes it difficult to actually perform the exercise that the author describes when he is processing various photos. Instead, one has to rely on screen shots in the book to see the adjustments he has made.Frasier is a gifted author, but I think he missed the mark on this book."
5,A must have for serious digital photographers,"I had been shooting RAW and using Photoshop CS before I bought this book, but I learned a whole lot more after reading it. Bruce Fraser explains not only what to do, but why to do it. The book is laid out logically and clearly with plenty of colour illustrations. Highly recommended."
5,The complete manual for Camera RAW,"CS Camera Raw is a great tool and this is a great book for getting the most out of your Raw files. I particularly like Fraser's tips like using option to explore the shadow detail and his discussion about automating with Camera Raw. The automation and file browser information is one of the keys to saving time when processing with Camera Raw. If you shoot Raw, you need this book!"
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about ACR,"As usual, Bruce's coverage is complete and well written. If you're serious about using Adobe's RAW converter, this book is the perfect title to get you up and running. The batch processing info in particular is worth its weight in gold."
1,No book; no service,"After one month I have received neither the book I ordered nor timely responses from the seller. I have sent them about 4 e-mails, some of which were never answered, others after too long a time lapse. I still do not know whether I will receive a refund for sure."
4,On Bosnian language,"This book recognizes the fact that ""Bosnian"" is an equal part to any reference to ""Serbo-Croatian"" or ""Croatian-Serbian"" language, so the reference should read ""Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian"" (in an alphabetical order). Ignoring this fact would ignore the existance of people that speak Bosnian, write Bosnian and were awarded Nobel Price for literatuure written in this language. This book makes an attempt to recognize Bosnian language existance. Good job."
3,A complete course for beginners on Serbian and Croatian.,"Hawkesworth's book is a mediocre introductory book on Serbian and Croatian. First, the book leans toward Croatian in its dialogues and spellings without giving much explanation as to the Serbian forms of these examples. Additionally, words are used throughout the book which are not defined in the lessons, nor in the glossary in the back of the book. Often, words are defined multiple times, yet others are not at all. However, one can find an excellent table in the back of the book on all forms of nouns and adjectives-- a great resource for quick references, as a student or traveler!Use this book, but only with a GOOD dictionary, and a Serbian tutor (if Serbian is desired). Otherwise, search elsewhere."
3,"A good start, but book seems unfinished","I agree with most comments in all other reviews especially ""gwilym"". I have been using the book on and off for a few years while I am trying to learn the language. I too, wish to learn the Bosnian variant, and find that the book is definitely more ""Croatian"" in its use of vocabulary. However, considering the disolution of Yugoslavia is still fairly recent and not many newer books exist, I was very glad to have use of this book. It is quite easy to follow and the different stories provide useful vocabulary.Definitely the main drawback is the terribly unfinished and unexhaustive vocabulary lists, and the exercises without answers. These two factors limit the book, and I find myself searching for a better grammar book with more examples to help me learn all the cases and verb structures. I could have learnt these better if there were answers.Overall though, a good starting book. Give it a try and ask your native speaking friends for help and clarification."
2,The tapes are useless,"The book is fine, but the tapes are useless, they are recorded at a high speed, so it's impossible to practice along with them. And they make no reference to how they are related to the book. Listening to the tape is like walking into a cafe of native speakers who are gossiping away, but are ignoring you totally.I found ""Teach Yourself Serbo-Croat"" to be a better book with much better tapes."
4,"Did not have the tapes, but...","it should be noted that you will never find a book in any language that teaches you to speak exactly like people of a particular area or age group. The closest you can get is a colloquial version like this one. If you know someone from Zagreb, this is very useful, and my Serbian co-workers understand me just fine (once they got past my accent.)Remember, English from England, Texas and Brooklyn is all different, but we have the basics to be understood in each. And the Spanish they teach in American schools is from Spain, not Puerto Rico or Mexico, but people from all three places will understand you.You should, however, start with basic area-wide How-Do-Yo-Do's before moving on to local slang."
5,This will be one of your favorite cd's,"Although I was fairly new to the jungle/atmospheric scene when I was first exposed to this album, I was immediatly in love. The beats and melodies remind me of music I've always wanted to hear but never could. MC conrad carresses each build and break with the finesse of a surgeon and the grooves enclosed just may make your head explode. In a good way. The Grand JG"
4,"Engaging, honest, and real","A very interesting story of the lives of two sisters, and how they coped with parents who had had an incredibly stressful experience in WWII, as well as growing up as East European foreigners in South America. I enjoyed Legacy of Silence very much, and I think others will too.Disclaimer: This reviewer is personally acquainted with the author."
1,"WARNING. Does not include the dance mix of ""I Go Crazy""","Since there was no track listing on amazon at the time I found this disc listed, I ordered it hoping it was an import maxi single. It's not. It has the ballad album version of I Go Crazy, and the Furious F single edit of ""Why"", a track from the album. It runs the same length as the album version, but it is a remix, more of a euro trance mix, where as the album mix is darker house. It's okay, but is it worth the purchase? Maybe if it had been the extended mix instead of a single edit. Because it's not particularly an outstanding mix. Tracks and times:1. i go crazy (CD ballad version) (3:44)2. Why (furious F. single edit) (3:22)"
1,Cheap bait and switch substitution!,"The seller clearly stated item to be a Digipower brand battery for the Olympus Digital Camera. Upon arrival, the battery was a cheap Chinese substitute of no brand. Avoid this seller, and his bait and switch tactics."
4,good product for the price,"This is not a bad product considered the price. It does not last as long as the original battery, but for the buck why not..."
5,Perfect!,I was missing this piece for my navity. The third party was most helpful with getting this piece to me and now my set is complete.
1,The Mocking Program,"I opened a pdf version of this book on the strength of a blog posting that said that the first two chapters were extraordinary. I won't contest the assertion because I didn't get past the first page. Why? Any author who presumes to use Spanish in his novel better get it right. Any publisher who presumes to market a book with Spanish phrases in it (front page, yet) ought to have a Spanish proficient editor or copyeditor check it. Anything else is sheer disrespect.I often read publishers' advice to writers more or less along the lines of ""if you don't care to get it right, why should we care to read it?' I'd say that's pretty on the nose with regard to this book now. And that's a shame."
4,Nicely done,"If you are looking for a cd that offers a little variety- Tejano, Norteno, and Cumbias- you have come to the right place. The music is very good and offers some very good songs from the former front man of Texas Latino. The song highlights include one of my favorite versions of Anhelos- think Los Aguilares, Enfocate- a very nice Cumbia that adds the awesome sound of Vallenato, Maldita Vieja which is more of your traditional cumbia with a little sax, and accordion, and La Reyna Del Baile another cumbia which is sure to get you out of your seat to dance. Overall I gave the cd four stars due to a couple of pop songs that didn't interest me, but I would have given it a five star rating just for the song Anhelos and the cumbias...if that makes any sense. 5 songs Tejano/Norteno Rancheras, 4 cumbias (style various), and 2 Pop songs. A good one to own if you like variety, but I wouldn't pay a crazy price for it."
5,how to do the tiger claw attack,I first saw this blade at my friend james's house when he introduced me to beyblades. the next day he was sick of them and gave me his driger s blade. It was awesome until this bully totally creamed me and he stole my lunch money. i then got furious and tried to learn the tiger claw attack.3 weeks later i had perfected the tiger claw attack and he met up with me again. i totally creamed him i broke his attack ring and blade base. so i bet you wanna learn how to do the tiger claw attack well first slant the launcher so the tip is facing the stadium then turn to the left just a little bit pull super hard and thats the tiger claw.i broke a board doing this attack it takes a long time to master. overall get this blade.!!!!!!!11
5,THE ULTIMATE BLADE,"This is a good blade but the japenese version is better.I know becuase I have it.You could make this a whole lot better by giving it the draciel's weight disk.If you have a choice between english and jap versions,get jap."
5,Driger,"This is one of the best basic beyblades. I am undefeated in using it. Great attack ring, the best weight disk and a good base. The only other blade that can match it is dranzer s. The attack ring keeps ur beyblade spinning longer than anyother in battle. This beyblade is the one and only 4 me."
5,technobladez::leader graham,"im the technobladez team leader we just recantly got the ultamate team including driger-s which ive not lost 1 battle with and along with metal draciel,ultamate r-attacker and a japanese wolborg we have the ultamate team therefor saying driger is a good bb but only in the hand of the masters...the team leaders"
1,Ray,hello i am Ray and i am here to tell you that DRIGER S STINKS!!!I have my bit-beast driger but my beyblade STINKS!!!WARNING:do not buy this beyblade because your wasting money
5,The unbeatable,This blade is the best blade i ever had i always beat my friends and they have a dranzer s and metal draciel it is better than driger f because i have one my driger s beats driger f all the time.so if you see driger s get it
2,"Bleak, even with the happy ending","I picked up this book in haste at the library, after seeing it was by Astrid Lindgren and a quick thumb through to see if it was an appropriate length for my five year old. The story was incredibly dismal, despite the ""happy"" ending with it's implied heavenly afterlife. The use of repetition in the book was far more suitable for very young children, however the darkness of the subject was not. Fans of this story may not appreciate me saying so, but I found Anna's melodramatic proclamations of ""surely I will die"" throughout the book to be unnerving. My five year old did not enjoy this story."
2,Very sad,"An older book, recently republished, by the author of the Pippi Longstocking books, The Red Bird is the story of Matthew and Anna who have very sad days with a mean farmer in Myra until they find a door in a wall that leads to Sunnymead and happiness.A modern young reader will not stay with this book long. Both its repetitive and lengthy text as well as its dully colored illustrations do not entice one to contine reading past the halfway point.And although there is a happy ending, the reader is left feeling sorry for Matthew and Anna, not rejoicing at their freedom.I do not know if Lindgren meant this to be so, but the story has the very strong feeling of being a metaphor for life on earth versus an after-life in heaven.Unfortunately, not destined to be a classic."
3,Titanium Band with Convex Polished Center and Frosted Edges,"I am very pleased with my Titatium Band. It is not as scuff resistant as I might have hoped, but overall I am satisfied."
4,Great deal,Seller was awesome to deal with and quickly exchanged the product for the correct size. A year later and my husband is still wearing it- is somewhat scratched up though and pinches his finger but for $7 we couldn't have been happier.
2,its an ok ring,It's a nice ring but its very dull looking I wanted a ring that looked like it was white gold but it will do for now
4,pretty good,"I went to my friend`s house then we battled. first i used galeon and he used dranzer s, 5 seconds into the battle, my galeon`s attack ring landed on top of dranzer, causing it`s attack ring to go FLYING!!! then 20 seconds later it stopped spinning and i won. this also happened to my classmate`s dranzer. Still it is pretty good if only it has more durabilty."
5,1 OF THE BEST BEYBLADES AROUND!!!!!!,"This is possibly the best beyblade i own and i have all the basics and more.in a compotion my Dranzer S won hands down. This is a powerfull endurance spinning beast and with a great beast (dranzer) built into it a diffinitive choice. Customize-ation is not need to this piece of brilliance. The onloy match i can think of to the Dranzer S is the fighter dragoon, also a bit of advise, Roller attackers are [not good]!!!!!"
3,Caution use only in defense mode for dranzer,"This bey blade isnt the best in attack mode because of it's high speed. When in attack mode it is going to fast so it spins around the stadium too far out and gets trapped in the pits. I reccomend keeping it on endurance mode. I have battled my brother's driger in attack mode and have only won like a couple times. When i put it in endurance mode it beats it all the time by out spinning it. If you can buy dragoon storm and equip this with it's weight and its spin gear but not the attack ring. Another combination is put the roller attacker attack ring on it, and then it is guaranteed to win most battles."
5,my beyblades,"The best beyblade i have is my customized master dragoon because it's the blade that made me state champ.the parts that make it are all the master dragoon parts except for the weight disc i use dragoon storm's weight disc and dragoon storms blade base.the best part about that blade is that it makes all the other beyblades jump when it comes in contact with my beyblade.the beyblades i have are:grip attacker, 2 roller attacker's, dragoon storm, galzzly, master dragoon, bakushin-oh, draciels, ultimate saizo, dranzers, master dranzer, hayate, and 2 griffolyon's.the dransers are good and all, but the dragoons are better...peace out."
5,dranzer s,"Dranzer s is the best blade. It with the Driger weight disk, the Dranzer s blade base with the attack disk from dranzer is pretty much unstopable. This is the best of the best buy it!"
5,LET THIS BABY RIP,Controling it is a little tough but it's awesome.(put in DRAGOON STORM's left rotation and weight disk to make it even better.)
5,ULTIMANTE FROSTIC DRANZER ROOOOOCCKS!,"My Ultimante Frostic Dranzer is the best beyblade I have by far. I had got a Frostic Dranzer then I had went to battle a Driger F, Driger S, and a Master Draciel all at the same time. I had beat them all. I had put the blade base of Master Dranzer. It was even better then last time!!!!!!!!! Ultimate Frostic Dranzer rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The best blade EVER!!,"This is the most awsomest beyblade! It beat my Master Dranzer, Bakushin-oh, Dragoon Storm, Ultimate Saizo, and Spark Knight! It also beat my friends Driger F, although by very little. I have it, and I was the leader of team Bladeraiders, but as I used it over and over, it began to get really thrashed. In the end, I lost to my little brother's Bakushin-oh, so now he's the leader. But this blade is the number 1 when its fresh out of the box! Get this beyblade, and I mean it!!!!!!!"
5,dranzer s,"I have this beyblade and it rocks.I allways win with it, it has on its attack ring, 2 att 2 def and 2 end.Its weight disk has 1 attack 2 def and 3 end.And finaly its base has 3 att 2 def and 4 end.LETTTT ITTTT RIPPPP"
5,Dranzer S rocks for a little while.,"I have the Dranzer S and I was unbeatable, for a little while. After a couple of weeks the thing on the blade base would not allow it to be in endurance mode, and when I was battling my friends metal draciel a piece of the attack ring came off. I think that you should only get this beyblade if you are planning on getting another beyblade to customize. I have 6 beyblades. They are Dragoon S, Draciel S, Dranzer S, Master Dranzer, Dragoon F, and Driger S. These are also the beyblades I recomend for beginners(especially Driger S.)Hope that that helped you.LET IT RIP!!!!!P.S.Driger S is the best!"
3,Dranzer S is alright...,"Hey! Whoever is reading this, Dranzer S aint all that good. It and Driger S were my first Beyblades. Its good that you can swith Dranzer S to Attack and Defense mode, but Dranzer S brakes so easily! Like mine, my blade base on Attack mode got dented, so now I'm losing all my battles. So I just changed it to Defense mode. If you care about your Beyblades getting broken (like me) don't buy this one. If it brakes, your gonna have to play in Defense mode for the rest of its time. (unless you dont mind losing!!!)"
3,driger f goes to the top,"OKAY SO U THINK MOST BLADES ROCK TRY A DRIGER F . ITS ENDURENCE IS FABULOS AND SO IS ITS ATTACK. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BLADE SCREAMS THE BEST BLADE. I PERSONAL HAVE BETTEN 12 BLADES.DRAGOON FIGTER,DRAGOON STORM,METAL DRICEL,MASTER DRAGOON,DRIGER S,DRONZER,DRONZER S,SPIN DRAGOON,ATTACK DRAGOON,ECT.IM UNDEFETED. WHO SAYS GIRLS CANT BLADE .SO IF U WANNA ROCK THE BLADING WORLD GET A DRIGER F."
3,I don't think its so good,"Well ok, this beyblade has a few problems even though it is like really good by the stats. The attack mode in this beyblade, keeps making noise when it slows down (don't know why). It can only last about 20 seconds before going down on a flat surface. Endurance mode, is really good, it can last very long. That is the most effective mode unless you got a long ripcord with a spring launcher or something. I suppose it is the metal pole hitting the plastic in the spin gear. I wouldn't really recommend this beyblade unless you can handle it."
5,an ok blade by a tourny veteran 12 year old,"dranzer s a good blade but the reason i rated athe durability is beacause my freind nicks dranzer 's attack ring always comes loose after a couple of rounds. also i chipped the front part of one of the ring sides with my trademark blade driger f , so get this blade it's good but it's not the best it's one of the best and it's kinda light so get a draciel s weight disk , i'm out ... later."
5,the ultimate beyblade,this is a really strong toy it is the ultimate toy for kids my school is being taken over with them.
5,"the best blades from the best beyblader,and combos",the best beyblade would have to be the dranzer s i have it and it goes real good with the gallzly attack ring actually it goes good with all dransers.another great blade would have to be draciel s and metal draciel there are great the dragoons i find that they suck.keep away from them i have the whole dranser set and i i have never lost with them if you mix there parts you will have the best blade take it from me because i know.so do what i did and get all of dransers and the dranser shooter.
5,DRIGER S RULES!,"I am leader of the blazebladers, And i own a driger s and it is undeafeatable. If anyone has a really good blade and wants to be a substitute for the team and lives in townsville, QLD, Australia come to 13 nutwood court annandale off marcarther driveC'YA!P.S. LET IT RRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!"
5,Dranzer S' Super Strength!,"Dranzer is one cool Blade! It has super good endurance and great attack. It was the stongest Blade round till Driger F came. What a great Blade! If you see this Blade, buy it!DranzoonChampion Beyblader of Oceania."
5,my thoughts,"I think this blade is one of the best blades ever. It is pretty powerful, the endurance is pretty good, and the defence is alright. If you are thinking of buying a blade, you should get this blade and the bit beast is cool, the dranzer. p.s. it's Kai's blade"
5,Why i Like Beyblades,I like beyblades so much there like my life.If it wasent for my trip to Toys R Us to bya birth day present I would never have hadethis much fun in my life.And my dad wantedme to do something kind of educational.
5,why i like Beyblades,...with beyblades you call learn about balance. You can also customize them the way you want. Thats why I like Beyblades.
5,tha best bey blade!!!!!!,"hi!!!! im the leader of the black dragon clan and i own a dranzer s and a gekiru-oh and a dragoon storm. This is one of the most powerfullest blades ever. you can make lots of good combinations with this blade and it's blade base allows you to switch from an atk blade to a defensive blade. my personal favourite combo that i use is dranzer's atk ring and blade base, with the dragoon storm's weight disk and spin gear. This combo is very good when in atk mode dranzer is ok, but in endurance it's really wicked and it outspins any blade i recommened this blade to anyone if you use this combo and you use a spring laucher with dragoon storm's extra long rip cord your blade WILL be INVINCEABLE!!!!!!!! REMEMBER LET IT RIP!!!!!!!!!!"
4,These are so cool.,"I have the Dranzer Beyblade and it's really cool. I play against my friend and I usually win because my Beyblade is stronger,but when he does beat me it's either by luck or it's because he has a spring Lancher."
5,Max's blade draciel is da bomb,The blade in my veiw is the best blade out of them all and it is a very fun toy if u try the game a couple of times u will get totaly hooked on it so give it a go and let it rip
5,happy blade,The dranzer s very strong. it spins for about one minute in my stadium (although it might just spin for a while because I am sooooooooooooooo gooooooooood)Ishould warn you to not lean over the stadium especially when you are playing me because I will beat you're beyblade up with my dranzer.(you better beleive it)
5,My bayblade broke within a week,"I got my 2 beyblades. I was really excited. I battled them a lot. When suddenly just after spinning it the whole beyblade broke into 4 of its main pieces. Then I put it back together I tried again. This time after one tiny hit the beyblade got a crack in it. I didn't notice it at first but then I had another battle, and the attack ring smashed into 2 pieces. I was upset so my mum helped me buy another one. The same thing happened within a day."
4,not as great as they say,The Dranzer is a very good beyblade and can win many battles in a row but i had it for a day and i have had Ultimate Saizo and Bakushin-oh for a month and in a battle between dranzer and a combination of Ultimate Saizo blade base and weight disk plus the backushin-oh attack ring the dranzers attack ring got destroyed during the battle and the other one came out unharmed.
5,super defender,I think Dranzer S is too fast to be put in attack mode because it would sometimes fly out of the ring but in defense mode it rocks da house!
2,Seriously?,The box was nice with having the hinges on its corners however as soon as I opened mine I noticed two of them were missing from 2 corners! Also the bottom of the box was smushed along the ridge. As a photographer working on strict deadlines I can't afford to lose time by shipping it back for returns. I am very disappointed. I lost 30 dollars for something I could have made on my own. I now have to tape those corners and turn it in.
3,Size Matters,"Beautiful earrings. My only problem really is the size. From the picture, I was expecting something just a bit bigger than half an inch I guess. Got them in good time, but was disappointed by how small they were. Because of the price I was only able to get this one thing for mom for Christmas. Nevertheless she loved them; they're very beautiful, but if you're looking for more noticeable jewelry, this is not what you're looking for."
4,A very good metal album,There previous albums were black metal. Well this album is just metal with very very good production and good melodies that makes the adrenaline super high. I recommend this album to anyone who likes metal. Trust me on this.
3,Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this CD, there are advertisements for website between the songs. Kids get enough ads during their lifetimes without having to listen to them on their CDs. We didn't even play the whole CD and probably never will."
4,James Beard's New Fish Cookery,"I bought ""James Beard's New Fish Cookery"" to replace the mass-market paperback copy of ""James Beard's Fish Cookery"" (copyright 1954). I'd had the book 20 years or longer, and it was in tatters. In fact, I'd lost a couple of pages containing favorite recipesThis is an excellent old-style cookbook. There are no glossy photos or trendy recipes. But if you're looking for a simple and delicious recipe for oyster stew or the lowdown on crab cakes you can't go wrong with this book. Most of the recipes are pretty simple, which isn't to say there aren't recipes for elegant dishes. (Check out Trout Amandine, in the Manner of Restaurant Casenave in Paris on page 336.)If you need a basic fish cookbook, I don't think you can do better than this one. After all, it is by James Beard.James Beard's New Fish Cookery"
4,Check this out!!!,"Wow...what a great find. This Venice, CA band has a sort of Beck-like sound mixed with good sound writing and a killer laid-back rhythm section. I'm told this band just got picked up by V2 (same label as Moby and Stereophonics). The whole CD is great especially songs: Metaphysical, Crystal Man, and The Brightside (which were the ones that stuck out for me on the first listen). I don't think this band will remain ""Unknown"" for long."
5,Wow! This is no junk!,"They've been compared to everyone. I predict that soon this cake-ish,beck-ish, dave mathews-ish, <everybody else>-ish band will start being recognized as what they are; something completely new, with the best of many who came before them. With creative use of sounds which, while sometimes unusual, are always easy to set into melody and harmony(/ies), this band has everything from neurotic jump to reflective groove. It all sounds very live; while the sound quality is great, you almost feel like you're listening to the end of a concert as the C.D. winds down. This is definitely deserving of all five stars. I cannot wait to hear Sumack's next release."
5,great stuff,WOW - this is truly one of the freshest bands I've heard in a long time. I think there is quite a future for Sumack. Buy this CD!
5,Muy Bueno,"Es un excelente disco, de una excelente cantante, la mayoría de las canciones son muy buenas, incluso las que no son sencillos. Un disco para quien gusta de la música romántica en todos los géneros, no solo balada. Muy bueno."
1,Horrible,"Do not buy this album! It is really bad... Get Myriam's ""Corazon Sin Dueno"". It is much better. Darina is such a bad singer. I bought it because I like ""Inevitable"", but unfortunately, all other tracks are really similar to each other. Her voice does not even fit in to the music... like in ""No Basto"". Sincerely, buying this album would be as buying the Teletubbies album. Watch MTV."
4,Glad I bought it!,"I bought Stargate:Atlantis sight unseen. I had watched maybe 15 minutes of SG-1 several times and just couldn't get into it. But because I love sci fi shows like Battlestar Gallactica and Doctor Who, I took my sister's advice and bought Stargate:Atlantis.I wasn't disappointed - the show has kept my husband and I interested through all of the episodes we have watched. We both agree that it's Dr. McKay who makes this show great. There is always witty, comical banter even while the show manages to keep that dark sense of foreboding about the wraith alive. I'm definitely glad I bought it!"
5,Vancouver is good for Sci-fi,This is great science fiction and I agree with all of the positive reasons written here. The cast is absolutely magical with an international quality that adds depth to the drama that unfolds. Torri Higginson is perfect in the role as Dr. Weir and to think further on this.......I don't see any weak characters in this highly interactive lineup. The development of Dr. Beckett from a background role to one of the front core characters was a good move by the executives of the show. Another big plus in Stargate Atlantis is the fabulous Bridge Studios facility in the Vancouver area and the wonderful forest backdrops. Southwest Canada is perfect for science fiction shows like this. This is a DVD set for all SciFi fans.
1,Got ripped off,I was sent a blank tape. I was ripped off.I wrote to the seller but the seller didn't have the guts to reply.So this is my 1st bad experience with buying through Amazon or people selling through Amazon.I don't blame Amazon at all. This was an independent seller.
1,bad 5th disk ... we're deeply frustrated,"My son and I have been ploughing through the series, enjoying every moment. It would rate 4 or 5 stars without question ... except that we have one of the bad sets with disk 5 containing the same content as disk 1."
2,Loved SG-1 Dislike Atlantis,This is not a patch on the SG-1 series. I loved all 8 seasons of SG-1.. This one I have gone thru the 1st two dvds and have to force my self to try and finish them!
2,Great visuals but poor writing and shallow characters,"whoever is responsible for the writing and general storyline should be doing work for troma.seriously weak as if it's written for 10 year olds.Nothing like the original series or other sci-fi greats such as Farscape, Next Generation, etc....again, WEAK"
3,Not that great but OK,"Is this show well-written and acted? Not really. The acting is generally mediocre and the writing could also be a lot better. Atlantis is not one of those shows that requires you to think, it doesn't grab you emotionally, dramatically it's never very compelling. But as pure entertainment it's not bad. Turn off your brain, get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy it for what it is: fairly good entertainment."
3,An excellent concept in rapid decline!,"Make no mistake, the Stargate premise is great and having watched this entire series in a matter of days I would have to say that for me it never rose to anything like it's full potential.Some of the plots are quite thin, some very soapy and others excellent. Some of the camera shots and footage is used repeatedly and there is a lot of repetition throughout the series. The characters, after 22 hours of viewing remain shallow.Ultimately, the main point of conflict only develops in the last 2 episodes and even at that, we're left at series end with a ridiculously cheap cliffhanger. This defines the series - rack 'n' stack, hope for the best. This excellent concept is now incidential to the needs of the producers.This box set won't be added in my library!"
1,Not worth your money,"This show is awful. It has very poor writing, wooden acting, characters with no depth, cheap-looking special effects... everything about this show is low quality. I've actually only seen season 2 but I read it's a big improvement over season 1... Season 1 must have been absolutely abysmal."
2,"no teal""c","the show is starting to look a little better.But there is no teal""c on this show.This kind of makes it sort of boring. I love stargate sg-1,but i cannot get into this show. Maybe it will get better as it goes along."
3,"Like the show, but Amazon streaming leaves a bit to be desired this time..",I hate commercials but I almost would rather have them than just a black screen. This is pretty silly. At each commercial junction the screen goes black and lasts for a few minutes. Then the story pops up again until the next time. Stargate Atlantis isn't the best sci-fi show ever but it's entertaining enough the first time you watch it. I really can't recommend the streaming here though. Maybe Netflix plays straight through.
2,"Great Series, Good Season, Lousy Episode","I've really been enjoying watching this series - definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of SG-1... but don't bother with this episode. I really have to agree with the other reviewer that this episode felt like the writers were out to lunch. There wasn't much of a plot or point to it at all.That said, don't let this stop you from watching the rest of the series. I haven't watched any shows beyond this point yet, but the earlier shows are better than this one and from what I've heard it gets even better from there."
2,Raw network feed with lot's of weird stuff,"Starts off with one minute of colored bars and varying pitch tones, followed by technical description of the video feed. The show begins around the 2 minute mark. But wait, there's more weird stuff. The ""commercials"" haven't been cut out, you get to watch 2:30 minute or 3:00 minute black screen intervals. Bunch of weird stuff at the end too, but I haven't bothered wasting my time on any of it. Preview for the next episode, then it sort of replays, but without sound.Overall, I like the series ok, but the presentation is HORRIBLE.Remember, the show starts at the 2 minute mark, and you need to fast forward either 2.30 or 3.00 minutes for the commercial breaks."
1,Sound & No CC,"Like it's previous Stargate, the sound is poorly done. Which if Amazon had encoded CC wouldn't be a significant issue. I don't understand why sound people think everything has to scream at you. Silence is Golden. Dialogue is what is important, music and sound effects should be in the background where they belong. It's like having to watch commercials where you always have to mute the screaming idiots!!!!!Hopefully one day, someone will recognize that when it comes to sound, less is better...."
4,"Episode 1, scenes cut out","I love Atlantis, so I don't want to give it a bad review. But I have a problem with amazon's editing. I have the whole series at home, but I am out of town and wanted to watch it. I only watched about half way through the first episode before I stopped it because there were so many scenes cut out. Why are they editing it so much? It makes me wonder how much they have cut out of other things that I have watched on amazon that I am not as familiar with."
3,Check your Disk 5 of the set,"A store in Regina, Canada released the set early, last Thursday. When we got to Disk 5, we found that the contents were the same as Disk 1, namely, the first four episodes. Naturally, we contacted Sony (who now owns MGM). Their reply was twofold, first, they do not deal with ""defective"" disks, their policy is to return it to the store. Second, they stated there were no known issues with this title.The second part surely is true, the store released it early! Today, with the official release, I checked 5 other retailers, having them open the box and play Disk 5, telling them what I found. In every case, it was the same, Disk 5 has the same contents as disk 1 and is therefore missing the last 4 episodes.Over to you Sony."
4,Great extras!,"I stumbled across this show late one night when I couldn't sleep. At the time, I had never seen an episode of Stargate SG1 much less Stargate Atlantis. I was taken by the characters and the storyline. However, Stargate Atlantis is now in Season Three so I thought I should buy the first season. I am very impressed. The show is great! The extras are even better. There are commentaries on almost every episode. Not from just the producers and directors either. The actors, such as David Hewlitt, do a lot of the commentaries. There are also video diaries and behind the scenes stuff. It is definately worth the price. I can't wait for Season Two."
4,chevron nine locked!,as a stargate fan from the original movie to the sg-1 series and now Atlantis I highly recommend this series to any sci-fi lover out there.
5,Best sci-fi in a long time!,It has been a long time since I saw a good sci-fi show. Atlantis is really smart and entertaining right from the start.
4,What's not to like?,"If you are a fan of the series, then you need to get this set. I don't pay much attention to the Extras.I like to view any series in order and a season set allows that. If you are not a big fan of the series, why bother?"
1,Excruciatingly painful to watch - avoid at all costs,"Unlike the preceding episodes, which are generally very good, ""Sanctuary"" is a steaming pile of awful. The writer should have been fired. From a cannon. The writing is terrible, and you can tell the actors feel the same way. Avoid at all costs."
5,Stargate Atlantis,"Love the entire Stargate series. Atlantis is great fun.Wraith are great villians!! Of course, replicators aren't bad ones. Wouldn't want to meet either of them!"
5,To counter an idiot,Hopefully more people will put a review on this season. SG Atlantis is an amazing series and if you liked SG-1 then you will like this. Lots of fun.
5,What's not to like?,"Good show, scifi, one of the things throughout this series though that made me mad is they show the first show of a two parter and not the second, that sucks, otherwise good show."
4,Just sci-fi fun,It was clear in many episodes there was a budget crunch. Otherwise a good series. Some episodes were exceptional stories.
3,The gift,This was good watching I enjoyed the plot and felt it was well worth the price I paid for it !
1,Loser,"Don't waste your time watching this episode, nothing happening here. Writers out to lunch, mostly scenes from other episodes. Do that too much, already."
1,Worst acting ever.,It is amazing how there are 5 seasons of SGA and only 2 seasons of SGU.Such a great Idea ruined by poor acting and a terrible script.
4,I just love it,"I think it's a great song, there's her soul in it. I read a few reviews and almost everybody compare her to Britney Spears, but I think Christina Aguilera will give us much more than simple summer songs."
3,This Song Does Not Exceed Satisfactory,"This song is O.K. From what I can tell, she is trying to integrate a Latin/Freestyle rhythm and sound with Americanized pop. It is a noble effort, but please, don't try to make your song sound latin and american just so it will sell more copies. It totally takes away from the song."
4,"Impressive vocal power, and looking forward to hearing more!","This girl is the kind of person that makes Britney Spears's managers and heads of others singers with little vocal talent cringe! This CD is a good introduction for her. It gets you dancing to ""Genie in a Bottle"" before exposing you to ""Blessed"" where her talent is more evident, but still does not do her voice justice. I look forward to her upcoming CD which promises more great things to come and is sure to be a hit! It is a relief to see that someone is wading through the crowd of talent-less teenagers to showcase her stuff. Hopefully this will make her talent all the more evident."
4,I really like this song.,This is a really cool song. I like when it comes on the radio. I have never heard anything like it.
5,Genie in a Bottle is great!,"I think Christina Aguilera rocks! I love the song Genie in a Bottle. The first time I heard the song I thought it was great. Once I heard it , I couldn't get it out of my head!"
5,Christina Aguilera Rules!,"""Genie in a Bottle"" is an awesome song with a cool beat and lyrics people like to sing along with. For those of you who think she is a one-hit-wonder, remember the Disney movie ""Mulan?"" Well, she sang a very poplular song for that movie and now she has another hit with ""Genie in a Bottle."" That makes 2 hit songs - not 1. 1 + 1 = 2"
1,try something original,"it amazes me that bubble-gum pop like this is praised by its fans as being ""music."" it is programmed, engineered and pre-fabricated and is truly not worthy of the money it makes. try listening to bands like big head todd, or dave matthews band, or pearl jam, or beck, or ben lee, or ben folds five, or elliott smith. try something original. you won't regret it."
2,ThIs SoNg Is Ok BuT nOt AnYtHiNg ReAlLY SpEiCaL,I wOuLd AdViSe YoU tO bUy BrItTaNy SpEaRs AbLuM fIrSt. I mEaN tHiS sInGlE iS oK bUt NoT AnYtHiNg ReAlLy GrEaT.
3,"Clever, catchy tune","I think she was extremely clever with the subject content of this song. Her vocal was clear and concise. The beat is catchy.I thought the very last phrase in the song was flat, and she definately should have done a ""do-over"" on that *phew* but all-in-all...clever."
5,This is a very good CD,Christina's new CD got my attention when it showed up on MTV about two weeks ago.It was the first time I ever heard that song.She really looks good on the music video with her belly shirt on dancing.Well if you want a good dance CD go out and buy Christina's newest one it rules.
3,sexy,"Sexy and seductive. Look out Britney and Spice Girls. The cover alone was worth the price. Geenie in a bottle is a nice tune. Christina can go for if her cards are played right. Her voice lends itself very well to latin freestyle as well as to sweet ballads as she did last year with her first hit ""Reflections"" on the soundtrack""Mulan""."
4,Cool But You shouldnt judge it against Britney!,"It is a cool song, but Christina and Britney both have approximatly the same talent. Plus Britney has had a little more experience, but Christinas song is really awesome too!"
4,I believe that this song is a fairly good one.,"This is a good song that has some noticeable potential. Christina, to me anyway, does seem to have a good voice. And is singing from the soul. If you listen real close to the song you will know what I am talking about. It is very evident. I can't wait for the rest of the album to come out."
4,really good,i really like this song. it has a catchy beat. she could become a really big star some day. and as someone has already stop comparing her to spears. they're both very talented.
3,Now THAT is a better definition of a teenage-girl singer!,"I must admit, I hate Britney Spears more than any other singer on Earth, and when I first heard about Christina Aguileria, I thought she would be just as bad. But suprisingly, she is pretty good- MUCH MUCH better than Britney Spears- Britney Spears is gonna get NAILED by her! Christina seems to sing with a more serious note, and has a better feel to her music. I also think she is VERY beautiful, even hotter than Britney Spears! anyway, listen everyone, throw away all those crappy Britney Spears cds and listen to the sexy and talented Christina Aguleria!"
3,summer of the battling divas...take 2!,"with the release of her debut single, ""genie in abottle"", christina aguilera positions herself as the caucasianmonica to britney spear's brandy. and, while the lyrics are most obviously sexual, i give her loads of credit for being less ambiguous than spears. though neither of their voices is particluraly more mature than the other's, aguilera's music and lyrics are slightly less insipid, hinting at the potential of an increased appeal to older audiences, as well as the out-in-force teen scene."
3,Not a bad song,"I think Christina's voice is typical of pop singers these days: only average. Nothing really stand out about her voice. She just knows how to sing, that's all. There's nothing spectacular about her singing ability. Despite that, I like ""Genie in a Bottle,"" even though there is too much studio enhancing of her voice in the song. But hey, that's normal these days. It has a catchy melody, but that's about it. Just a note on the side, I think her dancing in the video is only OK. I've seen better, like Britney Spears."
2,this is getting old,"okay. i used to like this song, before every station on tv and on the radio started playing it. i am so tried of this song now! christina please make a song that won't get so boring after a month of air time. ""i'm a genie in a bottle, baby. gotta rub me the right way, honey."" i can't get that out of my head, and that is mostly why i say this song has got to not be played as much."
1,THE DEBBIE GIBSON OF THE 90'S (NAW! DEBBIE WAS A LOT BETTER),"Britney Spears=Tiffany, Christina=Debbie. There's one catch Debbie wrote all of her own songs and neither Christina nor Britney do that. She's not going to have a long career considering the fact that her first single came out in July-August, and her album comes out in October.I hope she's enjoying her rise to the top, because it's gonna be a long fall down.Plus, the song makes no sense at all.She might also be just another worthless one-hit wonder!"
4,Catchy Tune,"Christina Aguilera has a hit song on the rise with her latest ""Genie In A Bottle"" The song is very catchy and you can find yourself moving with the beat if you're not careful. As a MMC veteran, Christina has the potential to hit it bigger than her fellow MMC member Britney Spears, who's vocals are too nasely and annoying to want to listen to on a regular basis. Christina's vocals are soulful and sultry at the same time. Check out her song on the ""Mulan"" soundtrack to really hear her talent. All I can say is that Britney Spears better make some room in the teen scene for this rising starlet, because she's about to get knocked to the side."
5,I Loved it!!!!!,"It's so kewl, I got the single yesterday & I've listened to it non stop! I's got such a great dance beat and it's 1 of those songs that hear once and like memorize and sing them wherever u go!"
5,Going To Be a hit!,"This song is a mix of two different genres, being those of pop and r&b. It seems to surpass the comparable artist Britney Spears, with better dance moves, and able to hit more notes. I believe that she will make it to the top soon with a little publicity, with the average rating aready being five and entering the billboard at the number 67 position for an artists first single is very remarkable."
5,great better than anything britney has done,the song has a catchie vibe to it and has pertential to go to number it has the air play now if it gets the sale look out we have a new mariah
4,its a good song,i like it cause it gives a massage to girls. you dont have to put out on the first date or for that matter the second. it tells guys that you have to rub girls the right before your going to get anything.
3,i luv that song and she has a good voice,"i think that Christinia is going to be very popular,she has a good voice and dance moves,and i recommend this cd"
3,It is another female one hit wonder,The songs are catchy like most pop songs are. It lacks favor and attitude. No longeviity in here songs
1,genie in a bottle,i love that song i feel the same way i feel like a genie in a bottle waiting for some body to get me out!
3,"AVERAGE,BUT OK","FIRST, I DON'T WANNA DIS ANY OF HER FANS, BUT IN MY OPINION IT'S JUST AVERAGE SONG WITH AN AVERAGE VOICE. I DO GIVE HER PRAISE FOR TWO REASONS:TALKING ABOUT NOT PUTTING PUT ON THE FIRST DATE AND TAKING AWAY SOME ATTENTION FROM THAT ANNOYING BRITNEY WHO IS SOOO AWFUL AT PLAYING THAT ""GIRL-NEXT-DOOR"" ROLE."
1,It's okay but it's definetly NOT good!,"Ugh..... the first few times I heard this song, I had to admit it was catchy and really simmered. But before long I was absolutely SICK of Christina's nasal voice and her annoying lyrics. If her whole album is gonna sound like this, I'm not looking forward to it. C'mon people... the song is REALLY stupid. ""I'm a Genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out"" Gag me with a spoon!"
5,"sexy,sexy,sexy","I look for good movin, groovin' tunes that I can get nasty to on the dance floor and it's all goin' on here!! This is a very seductive song with feeling and ease. Everyone will be singing or lippin' to this one in no time! Good job Ms. Aguilera!!!!"
1,I never received this book,"I ordered this book twice through Amazon. I received an email from the first bookseller saying it would be delivered, then later I received an email that it was not available due to student demand. I ordered it again from another bookseller who sent me a book on Italian Grammar instead. When I emailed them I received a reply that they would give me a credit and the book I ordered is not available. This is the second time (and last) time an Amazon used bookseller has sent a book different from the book I ordered."
4,"Excellent Games, but beware Damaged Audio Track Game","For the game , I got some problems on Installing the game into my Chinese Windows.It will ask you to install DirectX 3A Just leave it alone and choose Cancel when you get Windows 98.Story was great , except some places you might get stucked. Talk to more people in game ! They can help! Graphic was outstanding. However the game require you to use the Arrow key on keyboard to control the Twinsen. If they support Joypad , that will be more easier to control.I hope to see another sequel of similar game."
4,Action plus Adventure,"This is a great game for beginners. If player ""rests"", the game will take you through a visual overview of the entire game which can help players get an idea of what to do next. Good combination of action and adventure. Game started out rather slowly and I thought the characters seemed more in tune with a children's game. However, one is quickly caught up in the storyline and the characters are actually rather endearing. Game allows simple and adequate methods to renew money, magic and health needs as necessary. Action picks up as the game progresses with segments that require fast finger action on the part of the player. A great variety of locations to visit with unique modes of travel. One segment, the Dome of the Slate, is very unusual and found me holding my breath anticipating disaster with each step. Game requires shooting and punching some bad guys, so may not be feasible for the younger set. Great buy at this price!"
5,Worth every cent,"My love for the Twinsen's Odyssey game started from the game that started it all... titled ""Relentless."" At first, I was very reluctant to purchase the game. But once I installed it and let the cd do its thing, I was amazed. I have never seen such beautiful graphics and a great storyline in a PC game before. Its not violent compared to other games now. Besides, the small movie sequences make the game much more involving.""Twinsen's Odyssey"" is a great sequel to ""Relentless."" I like how the programmers basically kept the same concepts from its predecessor. Even the story is just as involving as the first. I highly recommend purchasing this game."
5,One of my top 10 favorite games!,"Thoroughly engaging storyline with lots of action and adventure. Though Twinsen's actions are a bit slow at times, it is still suprizingly good with hours of fun game play."
5,The greatest games ever!,Despite its age its graphics are like todays. Twinson is amazing in his own kind of way. You find yourself not knowing whats next. Except that you get to kill hotdogmen. Its the best game ever!
2,Good Design_Poor Construction,"Compact and well designed, but the anvil is made of ""space age plastic"" and broke after only a few cuts. For a few pennies more, the anvil could have been brass and replaceable. The Loppers are now unusable. We use many such tools in the Christmas Tree business, and are not careless with them."
5,Great improvement over the old headlights,"I also had fogged over plastic lenses on my Jeep. These are perfect replacements for my 1999 Grand Cherokee Laredo. Replacement was a cinch. A single 7mm hex bolt needs to be removed. The tricky part is prying the unit out. I used a small pry bar to work it out. There are 3 stud knobss that are held in by place by plastic clips. None of them broke for me while prying out. The headlight bulbs are included, but the 3 turn/running light bulbs are not included. I accidentally pried one of those out, but it turns out that you just give those a 1/4 turn and they come right out."
5,Wonderful illustrations,"Charming story with wonderful illustrations. My son loves to count the ""too many things to do"" items on each page. We also learn about the fun animals of Australia and how they surprise their friend Kangaroo on his birthday."
4,Success,"This book was what I needed. It has a lot of information, and it's all handy. It breaks down the book of Romans so anyone can understand."
3,Worked for a short time.,"Initially these worked great applied easily and seemed sturdy. After a round in the washer and dryer the corners lifted pretty bad. Tried re-ironing them but didn't hold. I would recommend these for a quick repair but not a long tears fix. So that's why I gave the ""it's ok"" rating."
5,These do what they are supposed to do.,"And that often is not the case anymore, so I am pleased to find that these things work just like they did decades ago. You cut them to fit, iron them on, and they stay on.End of the matter. Good, dependable product and not overpriced."
2,Get the BMG edition instead,"Although the performance is, I feel, one of the best available of this opera (see my review for the BMG edition), this Opera D'Oro release is from a noisy and distorted mono sound source whereas the BMG release is from the original clean stereo Austrian radio tapes. The only thing you get here that BMG failed to provide is a German-English libretto, which one should be able to download."
4,Not finished yet...,"This is my first Wells novel. I haven't finished it yet, but so far it is interesting. The futuristic ideas of the time that have come to pass are intriguing. I enjoy reading classics that I missed growing up. This is a good choice."
3,Good and Strange,"I like reading classics and I thought this book had some amazing insights on human nature that still hold up today but it was just so strange that I'm not sure I ""got it"".I recommend reading - just make sure you're not casually reading it because you may need to revisit it."
2,Disappointing,"While I was impressed with Well's technical predictions - giant windmills producing electricity, moving walkways, climate controlled cities, I was disappointed by the overall plot, thought perhaps I should not have been. Wells, like so many of his contemporaries, obviously thought the Victorian Englishman was the final stage in human evolution. His socialist and racist views ran through the book like a river. Sorry, Herbert, not your best by a long shot."
3,When the sleeper wakes...,"When the sleeper wakes is a fairly good book, but not something I would choose to read again. The book doesn't exactly give either a realistic or creative idea for the future, when 'The Sleeper' ends up in 2010. There are barely any things that change in those two hundred years, which is an odd concept to handle. How they refer to people is the same as in the beginning of the story when he's in the 1800's."
1,.45 cal. 1911 hand gun,"I CAN'T REVIEW IT FOR HAVING ORDERED AND PAID FOR IT ON 18 JANUARY 2007 I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT. HAVING SEEN IT IN THE SELLERS CATALOGUE, I WOULD PROBABLY GIVE IT A FIVE STAR REVIEW, BUT I CAN'T REVIEW WHAT I DON'T HAVE."
4,like it alot!,"I have fine,spikey hair and need a volumizing shampoo. I like the smell, and how my hair feels-my hair is also color treated and it doesn't seem to strip or dry my hair. My hair feels fuller."
5,To the Last Cartridge,"I first read this book back in 1995, when I was in basic training. It was my only escape from the monotony of Army indoctrination. It is a very enjoyable read filled with stories of valiant last stands and last minute reprieves won by hard fighting soldiers throughout history. Unfortunately my drill sergeant took my copy away from me and I have never seen another copy of this book in stores since then. This is the book that got me started reading military history books, and I have never found it's equal in terms of sheer entertainment value and ease of reading, I strongly recommend purchasing this book."
3,Desperately Desperate,"The one question I would put to the author can be summed in five words: The Alamo; where is it? I have to 2nd what was said by another reviewer on this item regarding the French Foreign Legion. They were in a lot of bad spots, but so were a lot of others. Perhaps it's just that I live in Texas, but when I think about soldiers in a tight spot, the Alamo leaps to mind. Apparently, this was not true for this writer. It is well-written military history, but there's no theme that ties it all together; no lesson learned; no truth uncovered. That would have been nice."
2,Only thing lacking are space aliens.....,"I don't normally review books, but this is over the top. I purchased it because it is a nice compendium of ""last battles""... Let's just say that there are two problems throughout this book. Much of it seems to be taken from Victorian ( or other) accounts that were greatly embellished - artillery in use all over the place at the Siege of Constantinople 1453!?!?!? Just one example - plus there is an annoying ""Great White Man"" theme. Locals are savages being ""saved"" by France, Britain or whatever 19th century power occupies them; almost every one of the natives seems, to the author's surprise, to resent foreign occupation. The Nazi's would blush at some of the the various atrocities committed by seemingly every non white, or non Christian in the book.I guess I just like to read eyewitness accounts unembellished..."
3,A little quirky,"Adults may find the voices rather irritating, although the kids don't seem to mind. Rather silly songs for the most part. Keeps the kids jumping around though, and that was the whole point, to get them active."
1,H.O.P.E.L.E.S.S,"This is the single most painful waste of money on my life. I bought it with the lowest expectations - that it would at least cool my room a little.Turns out, not just does it not cool, it blocks most of the fan's vent area, so the room actually gets hotter.I will stop here before I pour out my bitterness in a long string of curses, but to sum up: this item is not worth 5 cents, forget 20 bucks."
5,Wolfe the essayist is even better than Wolfe the novelist,"One doesn't normally think of a book on architecture as being funny, but Wolfe's hilarious evisceration of modern architecture's sacred cows is truly a scream. Wolfe skewers the pretensions and downright foolishness of some of the most famous names in 20th Century architecture, and does so in a manner that is always engaging and fun to read. You may not agree with everything he says, but you certainly won't be bored by his witty and provocative observations. As good as Wolfe the novelist is, Wolfe the essayist is even better."
2,From Bauhaus to Our House,"FBTOH is way out of date, not dealing with the best of Louis Kahn's work, which doesn't neatly fit any of Mr. Wolfe's categories. I wonder how he would categorize Frank Gehry, whose work came after the writing.I am intimately familiar with Bauhaus Fever, having survived its convusive early days (early 1950s)in the Department of Architecture at Penn, where the students revolted against the Beaux Arts tradition. Having experienced that first-hand and also having been turned off by Mr. Wolfe's public image, I avoided this book until June 2006, when I broke down and borrowed it, hoping to learn a bit more about the Bauhaus as an idealistic socio-political movement, somewhat of a Protestant Revolution.All I learned: 1)The Bauhaus stank of garlic, and 2)Mr. Wolfe's writing is toxic and best avoided by those who prefer peace of mind to rabble-rousing."
2,Not his best,"This is not Wolfe's best as it is basically an extended rant against the influence of Bauhaus architecture, which, while somewhat entertaining, doesn't really explain much. For a better analysis of what Harvard art historian Sigfried Giedion called ""the hanging curtain of glass,"" try his outstanding book, Space, Time and Architecture, which does a much better job of tracing and conceptualizing the evolution of 20th century architecture."
2,A mostly baseless rant,"There are a lot of legitimate arguments to be made against the Bauhaus and Purism, but Tom Wolfe seems too interested in writing a sprawling rant to really explore them. Only once, near the very end, did he mention that many of these buildings were not built on a human scale -- in my view, their biggest flaw. Instead, the book focuses on these issues, which seem minor in comparison:1. Glass, steel, and concrete are bad.2. Simplicity is bad.3. Architects who bad together into compounds are bad.It's hard to accurately judge this book properly, since I read it 30 years after it was written. Still, if Tom Wolfe wanted to make a case against this type of architecture, it seems like he could have set his ego aside and done a much better job."
3,"""Hilariously flawed""","Oh, Tom Wolf---could....you....have....missed the point...more?Mr. Wolfe, the thinking man's conservative truly pulls out all the stops in this, a wickedly funny roast of modern architects, and products of their craft.Witty at times, though Mr. Wolfe seems be as fond of repeating himself as his detested architects were of making glass boxes. I lost count about halfway through, but there the ratio of elipses to words was about 2:1.The true brilliance of this book is found in the duality of the humour. Wolfe manages to hilariously skewer the deification of European artists, while at the same time unintentionally showing his lack of insight into a subject as broad and far-reaching as modern architecture. The verbal hyperbole is to the point where you don't know if he's actually being serious.Good Sunday afternoon fun."
4,Modern Architecture debunked,"I live a few blocks from the marble lollipops at 2 Columbus Circle: Huntington Hartford's Gallery of Modern Art. And as I read the impassioned articles in the New York Times about its impending destruction, I have wondered to myself ""What is this strange building, and why do so many people care so deeply about it?"".Tom Wolfe is just the man to tell me. And while he's at it, he put a whole field of endeavor into perspective.I grew up disliking the ""modern"" residences that disfigured Haddonfield New Jersey in the 1960s, but being too insecure to say so, and feeling vaguely uneasy about Waterfalls and puzzled about The Fountainhead. Wolfe to the rescue!It's short; it's sharp; it's funny; it's topical, still; it's entertaining. Buy it, read it and you'll never look at modern architecture in the same way again."
2,a showpiece rant,"Wolfe's little book is actually an extended polemic against the Bauhaus school and all its offshoots in architecture and design. Although never boring, I found nothing new here. In fact, I found several direct steals from Robert Hughes's landmark SHOCK OF THE NEW (1980), the book and teleseries which came out the year before Wolfe wrote his little screed. I'd advise anyone interested in pursuing the iconoclast's case against modern architecture to check out this earlier work as well."
3,Another strong episode,"Two in a row -- I am impressed. Very good job of capturing the imagination and twisting the plot. Opening scene was way out of context for Longarm, however this was a good episode that kept the action moving and did not overload with sex to fill pages."
4,Good light tip up,"Used these tip ups for a while now. Great for light fishing for trout. They don't hold a lot of line, so they are not recommended for larger game fish or deep waters."
3,Taggies are too small with too little contrast in them,"My 5 month old son loves tags on everything. I bought several books with taggies for him to chew on, but he directly went for the real tag on this book and pays no attention to the little taggies -- they are just too small and lack enough contrast to be interesting for my baby. Wish they were more like real tags. Other than that he likes the pictures and feel of different fabrics, but we have other (cheaper) books for that."
3,Depends on the Baby!,"Cute little soft book for baby, but it does depend on your baby. This book would only be interesting for a baby betwween 3 and 7 or 8 months old, in my opinion, because there isn't a story and your baby has to LOVE taggies. As another reviewer said, my grandson only likes manufacturer's tags, not these. Sigh."
3,"just ok -- my baby isn't so into the ""fake"" tags","this is just ok ... my baby likes the real manufacturer tags, but not so much on the numerous ""fake"" tags ... he seems to like the book a little (he's just over 1yr)"
3,My First Taggies Book: I love you,"Like the other ""first taggies"" book - this one didn't seem to be as used as the child's other cloth books. Haven't got a clue as to why."
5,Chicken Little fun,"My 2-year-old son has 4 of the main Chicken Little characters in these plush dolls...not for cuddling but for character play. I do a pretty good Runt voice and even a decent Abby Mallard. He pretty much holds Chicken Little while I interchange Runt, Abby and Fish. He loves to act out scenes of the movie with them. They're cute, soft and fun if you like the Chicken Little movie (one of his favorites.) Good deal too if you find them on sale like I did for $3 each at the Disney store (but $6 or so for Chicken Little which was fine.)"
1,Waste of Money,I bought this item and it ripped when I was putting it on my mattress. Very cheap product!!!
2,Poor quality,"I bought this item because of it's price. It ripped while i was putting it on the mattress the first time, and i've done this before so i was being careful. Once on the mattress it was less than comfortable and sounded like a sheet of paper was installed underneath the sheets.It's paper thin and fragile and not very soft. I'm shopping for a new one..."
3,A lightweight goofball comedy.,"OK, you can't really judge this as if it were a real movie. It is more like a TV show. Masi Oka (from Heroes) is Bruce and Nate Torrence is Lloyd. They work in Control's gadget's lab and are the kind of nerds you expect them to be. Of course the important thing they are working on doesn't really work, they manage to lose it, it gets in the hand of some really bad guys, and they have to get it back at the risk of life and limb under threat of a deadline.Jayma Mays plays Nina, the good girl nerd who works in the pathology lab with its attendant strains on relationships. Marika Dominczyk plays the bad girl with the heart of gold Isabelle. Larry Miller plays Bruce and Lloyd's boss and does his usual fine job as an oppressive idiot boss. There are also some cute cameos from the real movie.This movie is just over an hour long and is a decent lightweight silly comedy. Don't take it seriously and don't judge it by exacting standards.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"
3,Movie,This was alright. Definitely not as funny at the movie Get Smart. I was hoping for something bigger and funnier.
2,For film completists and hardcore fans only.,"Interesting how utilizing more or less the same material produces vastly differing results. 'Get Smart' was a funny, clever, and exciting reboot of the classic tv show. This side project, filmed at the same time, was none of that.And if that wasn't enough - the funniest bits are the brief outtakes which are interspersed into the end credits. So what does that say about this mini-film?Mostly pointless save for the following:- We finally get to see ""Hiro"" and ""Charlie"" hook up! Yay! Was so heartbroken when she died in Heroes.- Terry Crews is a favorite character actor - and watching him doing a silly dance is almost worth the rental price. Almost.- You can never get tired of Larry Miller's wicked wit, regardless of the production. Gotta love his outtake: ""Well, it IS the Navy."" (laughing) :-DFor completists and hardcore fans only."
1,Get Smart - don't watch it...,"This movie spin-off is a very lame attempt to cash in on the popularity of the primary ""Get Smart"" movie, which, btw, is also doing rather badly, as per the last news I got (!).Anyway, coming to the subject at hand, this movie almost achieves blowing away all interest you might have of watching the Carell starrer. The story is nothing worth mentioning - some invisibility cloak (some originality!), the latest invention of the two bumbling but Govt. Geeks gets stolen from a party that's thrown inside the govt. high-tech top-secret lab by... never mind. If you've reached so far, you might also have guessed that you probably don't even want to know what's next! And guess what, I'll help that thought - 'cause I won't say anything else. It didn't even make me laugh, seeing Hiro (from Heroes) being wasted on such a slapstick role.Not all of us are wise enough to learn from others' mistakes - and they'll have to make their own.Take your pick - watch it or get smart."
4,Surprisingly funny.,"I found it predictable but funny. I have to admit that I had very low expectations, but it was a pleasant surprise. The script is not precisely a Hitchcock novel of complexity and unpredictability, but it's entertaining and fun. Most of the jokes require a certain level of education, and it's definitely a geek oriented movie."
2,writers needed to get smarter,"Bruce and Lloyd were very funny as supporting characters in this summer's ""Get Smart"" movie, and when I saw there was a Bruce and Lloyd DVD available, I snapped it up. What a waste of money. The movie has a couple of chuckles, but it was nowhere near as funny as ""Get Smart."" Don't waste your time watching this--Lloyd and Bruce are funnier in ""Get Smart."""
1,Not as funny as I assumed,"On a whim, decided to download because I just wanted something that was light good fun.Long story short. I regret renting this movie."
5,A Great Collectors reference Book.,"If you collect Antique Cameras as I do, this is a page by page surprise to study and enjoy. Beautifully illustrated with full color photos, and of course well photographed. This Book is a real keeper for the Coffee Table or the Library."
5,Good quality and deliever on time,I usually got the ink replacement at local Office Depot or Staples stores but Amazon offers more competible prices with no shipping charge. The ink quality is good and the shipment was ontime.
1,Previously Opened Package,I was surprised to find that one of the individual cartridge packages had been open. The tape had also been removed from the print head portion of the cartridge. It's impossible to know if it had been used for a while before I received it. Thought I was buying new cartridges.
4,Works as advertised,Easily recognized by the HP Officejet 5610 All-In-One inkjet printer.Cheaper than purchasing same ink cartridges from a local office supply store. Prefer to purchase ink products made by HP to avoid potential incompatibility issues or problems with ink quality.
3,TOO EXPENSIVE!,I probably don't have to mention this to anyone but I will anyway. Someone is going to have to explain to me why printer ink is so dang expensive??? Probably because of NO competition...printer companies make printer ink exclusively for their printers. The executives at HP are probably laughing all the way to the bank....and us customers just keep paying them....there must be something we can do!!
4,Colorizing Your Printer,"When it comes to printer cartridges, no one has thrived the way HP has shown with printers, and that also can be shown with the inkjet cartridges. This 2 pack of HP #22 is designed mainly for their Deskjet 3900 series of printers. It is easy to setup into your printer, and does a excellent job of making well-quality copies of colored photos and displays with the ink. I absolutely recommend this as a great buy for your printing needs, because it is inexpensive, and the quality HP delivers is better than most printers on the market.Price: BQuality: B+Overall: B"
1,Cartridges Don't Work,These cartridges would not work in my hp office jet 5610 all in one printer. they were not recognized. they did not come in a hp box.
2,Disappointed,I have two HP 1420 printers and have used them normally. I bought this pair of color cartridges but was very disappointed in the low amount of color prints. In the past I have had no troubles but both of these were far below print quantity compared to the ones I originally purchased. I wonder if they might have been sold with the original printers with a small amount of ink. I would not purchase this item again..
1,terrible,"wow, the description for this movie was pretty cool, unfortunatly, the movie SUCKED !!! Total garbage. Shoulda bought a couple of burgers instead, it does though play great as a frisbee, coaster or target practice disk , avoid at any cost."
2,Suspend your disbelief!,"I watched Hunting Humans, expecting to get a glimpse into the mind of the serial killer and instead got a glimpse into the world of Bill Gates. There couldn't have been a story without the heavy usage of computers and a knowledge of the victim's personal material. Picking passwords was a breeze for our main villain and i understand this is probably one of the most difficult moves of the computer!"
2,does not hold up and cheaply made,"I've had this item for two months now. It was missing parts when it came, and it took quite a bit to get them replaced. Once constructed, I discovered that the drawers do not go all the way to the back. They are about half the depth of the armoire, making them very small. Obviously, an attempt to save money in materials in way that doesn't show in the picture. It looked ok at first, but wears very easily. Even paper dragged across the surface will scratch it. Dusting it, will wear the finish. Now, it begins to get lose at all the wood dowel joints. Only buy this if you don't intend to use it, or move it, or dust it."
2,"Easy installation, but performance is weak","This card is an off-branded ""SmartDisk"" card, with no mention of the VST brand anywhere on it. Although installation under Windows 2000 was a snap (plug it in), my iPod has yet to work correctly with it on any of my laptops. Instead of recognizing the iPod as a drive, it recognizes it and then dumps it over and over after 3 or 4 seconds. In addition, the power provided by the card requires plugging in a clunky AC wall adapter to a port on the Firewire card -- not as elegant as I had expected."
1,Doesn't work with Powerbooks?,"This device would not work on my Wallstreet G3 under 9.2.2. It didn't work on my neighbor's Powerbook G4 under Classic or Jaguar. I reached this conclusion after trying two different units and numerous extension configurations during three weeks of experimentation. I suggest any Powerbook user needing FireWire ports cough up the extra bucks for an Adaptec unit, which Amazon also carries."
1,Just does not work; tech support non-existent,"Installed twice from CD, but program is ""unable to find"" a critical file. On-line troubleshooting guide is a waste of time for this problem. Telephone tech support is only available M-F 8-5, and email support promises a two-day response but so far nothing after seven days. The only function in the program that works is the link to their web site."
1,This software is GARBAGE!!!,"This software got the one star only because I cannot give it a zero.The main reason I spent $50 on this is for the phonebook transfer between my Outlook and my Motorola T730. I don't care about ringtones or calendar or whatever. I have a laptop and a PDA for that stuff. I want this to make it easier to do what a phone is supposed to do.The import function is sub-standard in that there was all sorts of mis-read information after I read in my comma-delimited file from Outlook. Then I came to discover that only one phone number per entry is allowed! That, after it supposedly can read in several phone numbers into its database on the PC. That was the show stopper. It goes back to the store tomorrow.Do NOT waste your time with this software!"
1,Will not install under XP,"Version 5.3.0 comes up with an error of: ""You have to have an adminstratitor account to run DataPilot""I have two accounts on my computer both of which are adminstrator.Both accounts give the same error when clicking on the Data Pilot icon after install. I uninstalled and reinstalled and received the same error. Install seems to work except for the run error.No responce from Susteen error ticket.The software box and cables are nice, but the bottom line is the package has no support and does not work at least with my system.I have never seen this error from any other program and have used this system for lots of programs."
3,Cell Phone Data Transfer,"This software gets the job done, but is not the easiest/slickest data transfer I have used. I prefer to not have to export my data to a comma delimited or other format in order to get it into my phone. Now that the bulk of my data has transferred, I will undoubtedly make future entries from the phone screen manually."
1,Really bad software,"I bought this product and the truth was dissapointing, I have a Motorola V60i which I could synchronize without problem, except because at the time of seeing I telephone of the directory one because they appear rare things. Now as far as the part of RINGTONES, because in my I telephone I must enter them of manually, which is too boring, but nonsingle that, if not that when reproducing them in my cellular one is listened to any thing. The truth is a bad item, I do not recommend for anything this software.Be carefull."
3,"Easy three, almost four.","The game is fun, and there is a bit of comedy to it. There are four attacks you can use for each weapon, and you can go to the following time periods:Pre-historyRomanJapanese Middle AgesEuropean Middle AgesConquistadorsWild WestModern DaysFutureBEYOND TIME!PROS:Good funComedyCONS:Can't go backPlayer only talks in moviesIs either too easy or to hard."
4,"Play it again, Sam","I can't even remember why I bought this, but I am glad I forgot. It's really quite beautiful. I must admit I don't know Patton's music back ward and forward but this is moving, interesting, and, ( is this damning with faint praise?) PLEASANT to listen to. Good for anytime, anyplace, I say. Parker's cover is arresting. Lots of subtlety and terrific musicianship on this CD. More than worth a risk. Did I mention sexy and scary?"
2,Charley would have hated this thing !,"First THE positive. Parker's rendition of ""Poor Me"" is worth the price of the disc alone. The rest is shear disappointment thru and thru. I respect Steve James greatly, but this brilliantly concieved project lacks the fire and imagination it could have had. Someone should really give a Charley Patton tribute. Maybee Alvin Hart or even.....myself????"
3,Not bad,"It does save me from scrubbing real hard. However, it's not for really heavy duty stains. Maintenance on grout and tile is ok, but heavier than that, it's not powerful enough."
1,Try within 30 days,"I purchased this tiller last year thinking it would be a help for gardening this year.A piece of cake-right? Wrong! It worked for exactly 1 one minute and we are out all the money we spent. It appears to have a faulty circuit breaker. The button for the breaker stays up and there is no way to start the motor. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone, unless you can afford to loosethe cost of this item."
3,dethatcher wanted as accessory,"I had the circuit breaker cut the power once. Other than that it has been solid. It won't do the same work as a big gas model so buy the right size for your project and soil conditions.One item for wish list, I wish it had as an accessory a dethatching attachment. It would be like the mantis dethatcher. I can't find one for remington. I'd rather have bought a mantis then so that I can have the dethatcher also.I have issued a complaint to [...] for not having a dethatcher attachment."
4,So-so title track... but great b-sides!,"""A Mind Of It's Own"" is a slighlty surprising choice for a single as it is one of the weaker tracks on her debut album, ""Victoria Beckham"". It's a mid-tempo track with laid-back spoken verses and a catchy chorus. The non-album b-sides however are the real find here. ""Feels So Good"" (not the Melanie B track) and ""Always Be My Baby"" are real pop/r'n'b tracks, which would not be out of place on Victoria's album (which, incidentally, is well worth checking out). They would also sit nicely on albums by some of Victoria's contemporaries, eg Britney Spears or Mandy Moore."
1,Strategic Corporate Social Responsibiity,Recieved a different version of the book. (South Asia International) The book is different. I didnt get what i payed for. To top it off they scratched off the edition and isbn. Thanks for nothing
3,Decent study of Inter-American Relations,"It's tough to write a review about an event never seen. The American military on the one hand were there but were forced into silence about it, and the American public, who were not there, could only guess at the truth. The video makes some good points about Noriega's relationship with the US, but some of its conclusions, like invading Panama to continue a strong military presence in order to reduce response time to potential cocaine-cartel threats in Colombia, are wrong and were proven so by the handing over of the Canal to Panama in 1999, just as promised.The main idea I learned about this is to consider varying perspectives and to let time tell the real story."
3,Panama Deception ofers deception of it own.,"The film presents the invation of Panama as ""evil vs. good"" when in reality is was ""evil vs. evil."" Watch the movie with an open mind, free of deception."
5,A film of atrocities,"I went to Panama right after the US turned over the canal in January, 2000 thanks to our recent great president. I saw the neighborhoods that the US decimated. All I can say is the least we could have done was let them have the Canal after the atrocities that George Bush committed there. There must have been a lot of unhappiness in Panama the day Bush's son took over our government here in the US. No wonder the world is terrified of the US creating Star Wars. See this film of the horrible crimes Bush is responsible for in Panama. It's absolutely disgusting what was done there. I cried."
1,wrong part,"autolite 96874 spark plug wire set app;ication info wrong. Says it will fit ford explorer with sohc engine, but wires are too short."
2,Misleading Title,"After purchasing this CD I was shocked to discover it was notBread, but only former group member James Griffin singing on these poorly produced, kaoraoke sounding new versions. What'sreally odd is Griffin's legendary battles with David Gates, thegroups other ""co-founder,"" caused Bread to disband (twice), and here is Griffin singing only Gate's compositions! I wonder if Gates even knew of this strange project. Also, Bread has an lpcalled ""Guitar Man"" from 1972, that should not be confused withthis one. Griffin does remain in excellent voice years later!"
3,Great fit but corners are too bulky,"I love the design, fit, and material of this cover and would have given it 5 stars if the corners were not quite so bulky. Some may not like the bulk but as thin as the galaxy is i like that the boxwave makes it easy to hold on to. The silicone cover fits like a glove and has a good finish as to not attract dust, dirt and fuz. The hard plastic gives it a good grip and makes.it feel more sturdy than most covers. I like the protection of oversized corners but these are giant and make it just large.enough that it wont fit in my shirt pockets orthe cell pockets on my shorts and pants. For me that makes it unuseable. Problem is noone else makes a similar cover :("
5,EXPOSICION ESPECTACULAR DEL MOVIMIENTO ETA,"Una de las mejores peliculas en exponer el movimiento ETA de una manera realistica y personal contrastando percepciones sociopoliticas extremistas con individualistas y humanistas. Las actuaciones de todos en el elenco compuesto de Eduardo Noriega, Patrick Bruel, José Coronado y la francesa Mélanie Doutey son esplendidos. Lo unico perturbador es la peluca rubia de Eduardo Noriega que en uno de sus camuflajes le hace brillar en todas las penumbras de sus escondites. PERO AUN ASI, MAGNIFICA!"

2,Right in the childhood...,"Ugh...Look I love 90's show tunes and meaningful movies as much as the next guy,but dont yo EVER put it near Tom and Jerry again. TERRIBLE movie for long time t&j fans but...Its a good movie for noobs (aka kids) who have no idea what the real ""Tom and Jerry"" is...so....2 stars for the kids...and 2 stars for ruining my childhood with this crap."
1,No no no no no no no no....,When Tom and Jerry started talking I nearly had a coronary. This movie was awful after that. Avoid this at all costs. Get the original Tom and Jerry shorts and enjoy.
1,Trash movies = slap in the face to adults.,"If I were Dana Hill ""Jerry's voice actress"", I'd say:""I voiced a male mouse, and then I took a massive paralytic stroke to the brain for tarnishing a certain lovable mouse's reputation"". Boycott and avoid this at ALL costs for Jerry's sake! However, this gets 0.1/10 due to Droopy's appearance (I hope those weren't major spoilers)."
1,Tom & Jerry The Movie review,"This movie stinks! It ruined the famous cat and mouse toons. It takes our cat-and-mouse team and not only make talk but also sing. The story is barely about them,its about a little girl who lost her father. The songs are awful this side of William Hung. There's little-to-no slapstick from the famous duo. The villains are cheesy and phoned in a mile away. the animation is not great but pretty good. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
2,Very unfaithful,"There are many things wrong about Tom and Jerry: The Movie. First off, Tom, and Jerry are nothing like the classic cartoons (except in the very beginning. I mean, they talk, they sing and dance, and they become friends. Speaking of singing and dancing, these are some of the worst songs that I've ever heard (The only exception is Tony Jay's musical number alongside Charlotte Rae). Plus, the plot seems to focus more on human characters rather than Tom and Jerry themselves. Why? Why would we care for these people when we're supposed to care more for the mouse and cat? And why didn't the creators of this film follow the original treatment of the classic Chuck Jones shorts? This could have been a great film if it was really done right. Obviously, this is an insult to every Tom & Jerry fan that's both living or dead.I would have graded this an F, but because of the fairly decent Jay/Rae song, I give it a D-."
2,Disapointed,"I grew up on Tom & Jerry and now my nephew loves the Saturday morning reruns. I came looking on Amazon to get some of the dvd's for him, I was so excited when I saw they have a movie. When we watched the movie we both found it quite creepy, it was nothing like the cartoon. We were looking forward to funny cat and mouse chases instead we got Tom and Jerry in a musical with songs I wouldn't condiser appropriate for young children."
3,tom and jerry,bought this movie for my son. he asked me to get this movie for him.he wanted it because tom and jerry could talk. he absolutely loves it.
5,A family favorite,The kids just seem to love this one and since my nephew moved away I had to buy this copy to send to him.
2,Excelsior?,"Seems like this film was produced with good intentions, but the result isn't very entertaining. Tom and Jerry lose their home, and after a few minutes of Tom chasing Jerry through the city, each realize the other can talk, and become friends. Then they start singing mediocre songs. The new ""Friends 'til the End"" team up to help a runaway girl reunite with her father and defend her against a mean aunt. What kept me from completely regretting paying the DVD rental price was the inclusion of two classic cartoon shorts, ""Just Ducky"" and ""The Invisible Mouse."""
3,Different from the original but still entertaining,This movie has a totally different feel then the original Tom & Jerry cartoon. My son would still rather sit at the computer and watch the old ones. This movie is great for the long trips in the truck and of course Tom & Jerry are the heros! Not as good as some of our other movies but still entertaining for kids.
2,Dissapointing,I expected this to be a movie with lots of chases (it has 1)Tom & Jerry make friends during the movie and can all of a sudden talk. This is not at all like Tom & Jerry. I did not expect this to be like this. It was a major dissapointment for me. If I were you I would skip this one.
1,Dvd skips!!!!!!!!!!!,I opened this and handled it for my granddaughter and she was soooooo excited but it SKIPS!!!!!!!!!!!! I can`t return it because I don`t have a printer and it would cost me 6 bucks for a UPS pickup!!!!!!!
1,disappointed Tom & Jerry fan...,"Too much song & dance in this...I like the original cartoons so much better... This involves tons of other ""characters"" that aren't even interesting...Sorry to waste money on it... Stick with ""Whiskers Away"" if you like the REAL Tom & Jerry cartoons"
1,WHY!? Why can't I give it NO Stars?,"Good lord, why are they re-issuing this film? With the hundreds of Tom and Jerry cartoons made for theaters and television from 1940-1980, all of which were much more watchable, why do we need to see this stupid movie again?"
5,Hot! Hot! Hot!,Just when you think you've heard his best. Dinero did it again and now with other great artists by his side. His music just keeps getting better and better. The collection has begun. To everyone out there who loves good music. It is evident that Don Dinero has talent. Definetly anotehr must have!!!
3,Eh.,"I got a great deal on this bear, so I added it to my extensive Kill Bill collection, but I wouldn't grab it if the house went up in flames. The only interest it holds for me is its cool Kiddo outfit. The sword is too soft to maintain any rigidity and the hair is just wrong. Eh, big time."
4,"works great, wish it was a bit bigger","These baskets work great for the hotpot my family does regularly. Maybe a tad small, but will take a batch of noodles or other goodies for a dunk in hot broth. Small light wire is easy to bend to customize them for your hot pot."
3,Basic and abstract,"I was a bit dissapointed with the book, it speaks in very general and abstract rather than actual terms. A fairly good introduction to who does what in a web project but did not provide any new 'truth', action points or an implementable project plan. The book is ok as basic introduction into the world of project management but if you have experience in managing web projects the book won't tell you anything new (except what people are getting paid on average).Recommend Kelly Goto's Web ReDesign, Workflow that works for those who are looking for a book to compliment their current planning."
3,Didn't use it much,"My professor told us to buy a chem book, but wouldn't tell us what book. So I bought this hoping it would help. Didn't relate much of what we were covering, so I sold it to someone else. For someone who likes chem I would recommend it. It was filled with some very detailed information. I wouldn't recommend it for a class, though, unless it's required for that class."
2,OMG his voice changed!,"I was desperate to add some Fats Waller to my collection of backing tracks, so I didn't do as much research as usual...WHY IS A FEMALE VOICE USED FOR THE SAMPLE TRACKS? One never knows, do one?"
5,Practical and Stylish,"I found this particular shoe very functional and stylish. The design got a lot of attention and was very easy to walk in, especially during my many trips through the airport!"
4,Excellent Laptop Briefcase,"Very nice, lightweight, laptop briefcase (at least that is how I am using it) that will fit a 17"" wide laptop. Within the neoprene slipcase is a vinyl halfsleeve that I slip my laptop into, and then I can toss in my power cords and other accessories on the other side without having to scuff up my laptop. The padded neoprene provides enough cushion to protect the laptop from your normal bumps and jolts, but don't expect it to provide significant protection from a shoulder height drop. The shoulder strap is sturdy as are the handles, and they sit well on the shoulder or in the palm. If you are looking for something a little bit more than a sleeve where you can carry some extra papers and computer accessories, this is a great item."
5,"fits 6x11"" Wacon perfectly","I was looking for something to carry my Intuos 6 x 11"" Wacom tablet in. The bag fits just perfectly, padded, with an inside and outside pocket for accessories. Simple bag, does everything it needs to do."
4,It does the job.,"Basically it is a case that will allow you to carry your 17"" laptop and just a little more."
4,Good Buy,This bag was just what I wanted. It was nicer looking than the picture or discription I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,"Very lightweight, easily fits my 16"" laptop","The neoprene bag is extremely lightweight, and provides ample room for my 16"" widescreen laptop and a paper notebook (along with the power brick and mouse in the side pocket). The only two issues I have are that the strap connectors are not metal (they are plastic), and that there really is little protection for the laptop screen (no hard panel in there). I cut a piece of thin plywood and placed it in the bag for this purpose, and it works out fine. Would be nicer to have something already built in."
4,Some of the reviews are for other items,"Targus CVR217 Neoprene Slip CaseSome the reviews listed are obviously for different bags as they mention carrying lots of extras or ""backpack"". This is a thin zippered slipcase with the addition of carrying handles and a shoulder strap. I looked at it at the store and it looks like my 17"" laptop would fit, although I don't think you could carry much else except a few papers and pens. I don't think the power cord will fit without stretching the front pocket. I didn't notice if the strap has metal fasteners, but it does not have 1"" of padding.It would be OK for occasional use if you don't mind carrying your cord separately."
4,All you need,"Good piece of gear; my 17"" Macbook Pro fits nicely; easy to use at airport, and price is right. Also makes nice cushion/insulator when working from lap."
2,Not enough space...:-(,"I purchased it by looking at the image shown here on Amazon, but when I received this item i was disappointed. There is not enough space for the charger and other stuff like CD and notebook."
4,Great case,"I have 17"" laptop, while it doesn't fit in the smaller inside pocket it does fit in the large main pocket. I use the smaller pocket to hold my cooling fan and cables. The bag is well-built and sturdy. A good buy."
5,Lightweight & compact,"This bag is for someone that is only looking for something to carry minimal items -- laptop, mouse, cords. We were just looking for something to be able to protect the laptop & hold the essentials while traveling. The shoulder strap is a must-have. We have only used the bag on a couple of flights, but it seems to be very well made & sturdy enough. Of course it's not going to provide a lot of protection if anything heavy is put on top of it, but it keeps the laptop from being scratched & is easy to carry around. The price was right for what we were looking for & we are happy with our purchase."
5,Targus Neoprene Sleeve 17 inch,"I had a hard time finding a 17 inch lap top computer bag locally. Found this one on Amazon.com. Good price, arrived in a timely manner. Love the bag. It's exactly what I was looking for. In fact found out that my sister bought the same bag for my Mom recently. Computer, cord and mouse fit inside with room to spare."
2,"Targus CVR217 Neoprene Slip Case for 17"""" Notebooks","It's alright, you get what you pay for! If you have a nice laptop, get a good bag, this bag does not have ""storage"" for peripherals and won't protect your laptop if you drop it or it gets hit."
2,Not what I expected.,This product is not what I expected. I am sorry I purchased it. I have since found what I wanted at another retailer. Big disappointment.
3,"A good ""low end"" case","Not the best case, but probably the best case for your money. If you're looking for something that's functional and cheap, this may be one to try. Otherwise, go for the full leather ones.Buyer shipped the product quickly and it arrived in great shape!"
2,Neoprene Slip,"I have not liked this product as much as I thought I would. It is too large to fit in a brief case for extra protection and inssuficient in size to use as a brief case itself. It is, however, relatively well constructed."
2,"Not good, Not as per discription on website","Light weight, but not as any one expects a laptop bag to be. You can get better leather laptop bag at same cost. The material of the bag is not waterproof and does not seems to be durable"
2,It is only OK............,"Too large for my Laptop....I was also afraid of the strap breaking - because it is plastic, and all of the fittings are plastic. Not good.....It alsolooks very diffrent than that on the photos.... Kind of flimsyI don't use it........... I bought another case........"
4,just what i wanted,"This is the case just what I wanted in the reasonable price. My new 17 inches widescreen Toshiba laptop fits in well. As people have mentioned, this is not water-proof. The material made for this case is a little be flexible and may strech a little bit when I hold the handles. Thus, there is a little bit safety concern to me. Overall, I like this product."
4,Adequate case,"This slip case is a quite adequate case for a 17"" Laptop computer for not a lot of money. The case is very light neoprene and has metal hardware which is remarkable considering the price of the case. The inside is divided by a piece of thin nylon into 2 compartments and there is a handy outside pocket with a velcro closure. It is definitely worth the price."
2,too small,"it's too small for a 17"" laptop, because can't fit the power adapter, or other staf, like mouse, etc."
2,Double check before you buy.,"Targus CVR217 Neoprene Slip Case for 17"""" Notebooks (Black/Blue)""Bag had cheap feel and looked like the clips on the shoulder strap could break easily. I returned it. Be careful to make sure that the product review you are reading is for the bag you are looking at. I made my purchase based on a review for a different bag even though it was on the page for the CVR217."
5,"Neoprene 17"" laptop slip case","Just what you need to keep portable laptop safe for transport. Not bulky, but has room for cds, dvds, etc.Targus CVR217 Neoprene Slip Case for 17"""" Notebooks (Black/Blue)"""
4,good gift,I give this slip case as a gift and apparently it was a hit. the receiver said it was perfect....not bulky but provided good protection. they also liked that it could be carried by handles or by the shoulder strap.
1,Disappointing,"For the price, I expected a lot more. Perhaps I shouldn't have, ""Slip Case"" is probably accurate, but the quality feels like it is for disposable one-time use, and gives almost no protection to the computer. This will be the first ever item I return to Amazon in 7 years of shopping here."
3,"""Great Job Targus""??","The first review in this series, entitled ""Good Job Targus!"" is what convinced me to buy this bag. All I can guess is that the product must have been changed a lot since that user bought it: The clips are plastic, not metal, there is no velcro strap (or any other kind of strap) inside the bag to secure the laptop, and there is certainly not 1"" of padding surrounding the laptop--more like 1/8"". It's an okay product, I guess, but not great by any stretch of the imagination. What I expected, based on previous reviews, and what I received, were quite different...which is a bit disappointing."
3,"This fits the 17"" Dell Inspiron E1705 series notebook","Nothing else seems to, so you have to buy this. It is rather plain and ugly but it definitely fits. I looked for days on the Web for another nicer bag but couldn't find anything in the right dimensions for my laptop. Padded shoulder strap is not that padded. It is very lightweight, thin, but does the job. Anything more padded would be heavy and the E1705 is already very heavy. So, B+, worth it if nothing else contains this mega laptop. (Neoprene smells a bit funny and rubbery synthetic). Contains: laptop, a few slim folders of paper, some pens, very little else. Not expandable. It barely holds the power cord (very irritating - it bulges out) and the outside slip pocket does not zip shut so stuff falls out (don't put wallet in that slip pocket)."
1,What you get is NOT what you see,"Amazon shows this as a case with more features than it actually has. The product is just a thin case with no space for power cords, or extra battery, or even CD or DVD. The site makes it look like the case is bigger too -- this is a SMALL case. I also found that there is no price difference between this case on Amazon and the same one at Comp USA. Better off going to Comp USA, seeing the cases for yourself, and making the right decisions. Also note, Amazon has told me they may not refund the mailing cost for the return because, in their eyes, the return was triggered by my not liking the product versus them not properly describing it."
2,Adequate but not great,"I purchased this neoprene slip case to use for my 17"" notebook because I couldn't find any better ones. Though it fits, it's not the greatest notebook case I've had. So if you can find a better one, slightly higher in price, it might be worth it over this particular one."
5,Great Item for the price,"I love this bag,I love the wetsuit type material, it holds my laptop and all the accessories really well. Quick shipping, great product."
3,A bit disappointed,"I orderd this bag because it looked slim, sleek, sturdy, and well received by others. However, when I received the bag the first thing I noticed was that the handle clips were plastic - a huge problem, in my opinion. Next, the casing was a little too thin, so not much protection for the computer if it fell or got bumped into. Also, the sholder strap seems thin and flimsy, as if it will fray and wear out after a year of use. One positive not was in regards to its weather protection; the interior of the case is surrouned by a nylon lining, so it would prevent water from seeping in during rain or snow.If I were using this bag as a slipcase to put into my backpack, I wouldnt mind it, but since I was intending to use it as a carrying bag, I dont trust it with my expensive laptop."
5,A Perfect Laptop Case!,"A perfect laptop case, it is very roomy for a 15"" laptop and accessories. It is perfect for students, my both college kids love it."
4,Very Nice Bag For Laptop,"The Targus bag is a very nice carry bag for my laptop. The bag is a soft material like bag, not a heavy leather-like bag. At first I was concerned that the soft bag would not adequately protect the laptop. However, I took the bag / laptop to California (from NY) and found that me and the bag got along very well together. It was easy to handle in the overhead bin on the airplane. The bag protected my laptop very well. It has a few compartments for papers and pencils and such. Now that I've used it, I like it."
4,Great bag for the price.,"I bought this bag for my new 17"" Laptop and I like it. It's roomy and it was very inexpensive compared to other brands. I bought it because it I needed a bag with handles, the shoulder strap was an extra benefit.Targus CVR217 Neoprene Slip Case for 17"""" Notebooks (Black/Blue)"""
3,handy little bag,"This is an affordable, lightweight, flexible, water resistant bag for carrying my Lenovo 17 inch laptop. I like its fabric and light weight and the way my laptop slips easily into the case. I can carry it either in my hand or over my shoulder. I wish it had better pockets for cords, battery pack, wireless mouse etc, but cannot imagine how a case of this design could do anything different. It does hold these things and more but it makes it a little bit bulky. Since it is slim, these items will of course bulk it up. Nice case in any case. Glad I bought it."
1,Flimsy Targus Notebook Bag for 17 inch Notebook,I purchased this product after reviewing the positive reviews of others and wish I had not. The case is much too flimsy to prevent damage to the PC and there is virtually no storage space for any accessories. Especially the power supply that bulges on the outside. I would definitely not purchase this product again.
2,Good small bag,"Perfect if you are only carrying a laptop, not enough room to carry much more than some papers."
3,Targus CVR200 Laptop sleeve,The item received is of lower quality than the exact same item purchased in person at BJ's Club for the same price. I wonder why?
3,Nice Case,"Fits nicely, but not much padding so it doesn't offer alot of protection, but it is super light weight which is nice!"
5,Great Bag!!,"This bag is a perfect blend of protection and ease of use. It is thick enough to protect, but not heavy. It also has the advantage of a pocket for small accessories. Fits my 17"" Toshiba Satellite 300 really well."
2,"Light, but needs more padding","I would rate this higher, but the padding is insufficient for a 17inch, 5lb laptop. It is very light, but I worry about any fall over 1 foot, or less than a foot on a non-carpet surface. Good price, good company, but not very sturdy."
5,Wonderful Case!,"I had a hard time finding a carrying case for my 17"" laptop. I ordered this case and love it. It is lightweight and suits my purposes. I am an older adult and don't lug my computer to classes or the local coffee shop every day so I had no need for a hard-shell case. I do tote my computer with me a couple times a month and this case is wonderful. It has plenty of room for other items I need to take with me. The price was great and for my purposes, this is an exceptional value, great design ... perfect for my needs."
2,Not much storage,"There is one zippered area for the laptop, but the other pocket only has a small velcro tab. I would be afraid my items would fall out. Hardly even big enough for the power supply and mouse. Other than that it is nice - very light and strong."
3,Targus CVR217 Review,The CVR217 Neoprene slip case that I ordered along with a Toshiba laptop is very well constructed and I have no complaints with that and it has a pleasing appearance. I would like it to have better accommodations to hold the power supply and a mouse--perhaps separate pockets. Putting the laptop and the peripherals into the slip case results in unsightly bulges.
4,The best part is the strap,"I needed a travel case for my new 17"" laptop, but didn't want something huge or costly. This was just the thing - basically it's a neoprene sleeve, with a shoulder strap and a side pocket. The pocket is much for carrying accessories because of the shape - mostly I think it's meant for sliding in folders & paperwork. What I really love is the shoulder strap - it's stretchy and bouncy, very kind to my shoulder. I should find out if I can just by a strap like that without the bag, so I can swap it onto our other shoulder backs (over the years, my husband and I have about a dozen...)"
4,Amazing individual,"What an absolutely amazing individual. To me, the best part was the talk about perseverence, and just finding a path that you want to take and pushing full-tilt to get everything you want. I can't say enough about this guy's determination, and was shaking my head laughing when he spoke about going to Vietnam for his post-surgery R&R; after fighting in Vietnam.Only thing I would suggest is to change the title to make it a memoir, as opposed to focused on Carlos the Jackal. Hunting CJ seemed almost like an afterthought and a little bit disjointed (as well as anti-climatic), and was overshadowed by the Vietnam memoirs up front and the fact that OBL was in Khartoum at the same time. Easy reading, nothing complicated, but gives you a good perspective on a guy that embodies determination. I'm going to use him as a model for my future endeavors."
4,Amazing Person,I recommend this book if you are interested in how a successful CIA agent thinks and operates - not the fictionalized version. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the sound of his brass balls clanging together distracted my reading.
2,Billys service great/book bombs,"This biography was really disapointing.This book was written in a very light and simple style,leaving much detail out.I guess you do have a overview of his service,but if you are looking for detail or action dealing w/Vietnam,espionage,Middle East or clandestine warfare there are many other great choices."
3,Not always a page-turner,"Reading the memoir of a man who helped take down Carlos the Jackal, one of the most notorious terrorists of then 1970s, seemed to make for roller-coaster read. Unfortunately, Carlos didn't go down like Pablo Escobar. He was arrested; no gunfight, no car chase, no hostage crisis, no time bomb. While the book certainly is interesting for its historical significance, Waugh's ""action"" in taking down Carlos was sitting in an abandoned building for hours upon hours and days upon days just watching the Jackal's house.The book also includes some of Waugh's other career highlights, including going into Afghanistan in 2001 in his 70s. I don't want to discredit Waugh's service, certainly he's done more than most, and the book isn't necessarily unenjoyable; maybe let's just say it's a good thing it's not any longer than it is. Some parts are page-turners, most are not. If you like this book genre, you'll like this book. Otherwise, skip it."
5,book review,"A great book. Quick to read, but really helped me to understand the times of Ruth. It helped me to understand Old testament scripture."
5,Poor Humble Ruth,She had so many factors againist her journeing to the promised land but she overlooked them and kept an eye on God. Never giving into the easy route but took care of her mother in law. She was a hard worker and a humble loving person. This story is great for the person who doesn't believe they are good enough but come out the shining star.
4,remarkable,I had just started to read the Mark of The Lion Series when my beloved brother became criticaly ill. I could not stop with that series and just finished Unshaken. These books sustained me through a very difficult time by giving me courage and increasing my faith in a loving caring God that does answer prayer. I highly recommend Francine Rivers books as they are an inspiration to anyone that reads them.
3,The Unshaken Moabite,"Unshaken&#8213;Ruth""She gave up everything, expecting nothing, and God honored her.""Ruth lived under the Moabite traditions for her whole life, but it was until she met Naomi's family that she realized that there was a God bigger and greater than the gods her country worshiped.Married to one of Naomi's son, she lives on the outskirts of Moab, an out-cast. But she can earn her life back, all the riches, all the gods, all the friends, after a tragedy that left Ruth, her Moabite sister-in-law, and her mother-in-law speechless and mourning.She has two choices: live the life she was born into or go with her mother-in-law to the uncertainties and loneliness with only her God to sustain her.Her choice could change the fate of a nation and the world."
5,Well worth your time to read!,"As is the case with the others in this series of novellas, this one is educational and entertaining - all at the same time. The back of the book gives study questions that help with further understanding and application to everyday life. I have read all five and each one is fantastic!"
5,Very Helpful *Starter* Dictionary,"I have purchase 5 books/dictionaries for learning Chinese.This one is my favorite. It has fewer words listed than other dictionaries, but its contents include many words AND how to use them in common phrases. It also includes helpful grammar tips that other dictionaries don't include."
5,Good book for me as a beginner.,I like the book because of its simplicity. It allows me to look up words without all the confusion of the larger Manser Oxford Chinese Dictionary.
1,get the Oxford Chinese Dictionary instead,"Why get the lesser, shorter version of the Oxford Chinese Dictionary when one could get the whole version for about the same price? This dictionary is basically a shorter version of Oxford's more comprehensive dictionary, and the student of Chinese will soon outgrow it. You are better off getting the Oxford Chinese Dictionary (0195968336)."
3,Totally unfamiliar with the language - thus worked with checks and balances.,I ordered the CDs and backed this up with an order for the dictionaries. The Cds were rated by quality on Amazon and related links. The combination now works quite amazingly for me. My initial order was for my temp PA who was married to someone of Chinese origin in South Africa. My youngest son attended the Pretoria Chinese School as well as the German School in Pretoria.My temp PA is also a family member and has displayed an interest in Mandarin - hence my purchases. The biggest plus though is that I am personally in a new learning phase now. I do speak read and write at least one other European language. I spent a very short time in South East Asia and wanted to learn Kmer. I think that ALL citizens of the world should now have a basic - even very elementary knowledge of Mandarin.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.Randi Erentzen
2,more starter than dictionary,"this is a good aid to language study for beginners, but it's not really a dictionary in the normal sense. perhaps 'learner's vocabulary guide' would have been a better title. when reading any but the simplest of texts you will find it insufficient."
2,There's no way you can learn chinese with this book,"It makes learning so complicated unless you already know some english and are looking to improve your spelling, just the way the book is set up makes it messy."
1,Barely Enough for Even Beginners,"This is physically a very nicely put together book, with very readable type, attractive layout and design, and sturdy paper. Nevertheless, this is an altogether inadequate dictionary, even for beginners. There simply aren't enough words provided in this book. You are likely to become as frustrated as I was, after purchasing this book, to time and again fail to find definitions for commonplace words from day-to-day conversation. Until Oxford drops the ""starter"" concept and doubles or triples the listings in this volume, don't waste your time or money. Get an unabridged Chinese dictionary, even if you are a beginner. I wish now that I had."
2,"Terrible, content is extremely limited.","I know this is a ""starter"" dictionary, but I wouldn't recommend it even for beginners. There are very, very few entries. If you are studying the simplified characters, get your self a copy of the ""Ying Han Cidian"" by Beijing Languages Institue."

Perfect stuff for that saturday day afternoon, leave your brain behind and just watch the film fun."
1,Poor remaster of a great album,"Wait until this album is reissued again. It would be a shame for anyone to buy this and get the wrong impression. The masters for this reissue are apparently poor on the 4th track Moritat. Returning it to Amazon won't help, the disk is fine, the master is bad. Concord (or perhaps some other company with a little more attention to quality control) should recall these, remaster it and try again."
5,A Collosal Ensemble!!!,"This is vintage Sonny, a must-have for any jazz fan. This disc is FUN to listen to repeatedly. All improvisors, not just saxophonists, should study Sonny's takes on ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" & ""Moritat;"" plus, hear the composer blow on his own now-standard St. Thomas. Also, as a rhythm section player, I feel this is a ""must-study-over-and-over."" I'm blown away by Max Roach playing time on just the ride and hat for several consecutive choruses of ""Moritat."" Doug Watkins is solid throughout and Tommy Flanagan is a perfect jazz pianist here."
4,Sonny and Max burn!!,"Excellent classic performance by one of the best sax players ever. And Max Roach is simply the killer jazz drummer of all time. I was particularly impressed by the sonic quality - for a mid 50's analog recording, it was produced really well - Roach's cymbals really stand out to me, and Rollins's exceptional style and tonality is well presented. Love every minute of it!"
5,A great buy!!,"I am not very familiar with any of Rollins' work, this is his only album I own. I only got it because it was highly reccomended, I'm just here to reinforce that reccomendation. Rollins is full of energy, not to mention the rest of his group. Tommy Flanagan's solo's are a beauty, and the bassist is impressive too. Oh yeah, Max roach, enough said. I love every part of this album, an instant fav."
4,grew on me,"I had to listen to this one several times before I truly appreciated it -- and it was well worth it. ""Strode Rode"" and ""Moritat"" are classics; ""Blue 7"" hits home also.Still, you might also want to consider Cannonball Adderley ""Somethin' Else,"" and for contrast some John Coltrane (Kens Burns has a good selection of Coltrane)."
4,"Superb, a sax lovers delight","Sonny Rollins is a master of the sax. This album will lift you and thrill you. If you are looking to set a mood for a special friend, Sonny provides perfect background music."
3,overrated,"This CD is way overrated. Truth is Rollins isn't as good as some others like Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, Zoot Sims, etc. Max Roach'es drum solos are annoying and sound like nothing more than a clumsy effort by an amateur.I'm not saying that all of Rollins' playing is not enjoyable, am simply saying this is not the great jazz album that some claim to be.If you can get it at a discount, by all means, go for it--otherwise not worth it. Just my opinion."
1,Waste of Time & Money,Not an original thought is presented in the book.You won't find any high probability proprietary trading examples that were developed by the author. There was not even one example where that author presented a trade setup which he proved that the trade won over 50% of the time.All the trading advise presented in the book could be found for free on the internet. It is just reiteration of conventional trading maxim.
5,Great Book!,"Like some other reviewers, I have read 100 other trading books. This one really pulls it together for me. It is not so much of a textbook as it is like having a personal trainer looking over your shoulder. Link has been in the trenches! It shows you not so much what to do as how to do it. The process, the thinking. This is the first book about which I have been motivated enough to write a review. I loved it."
3,"Some good information, but poorly presented","I'm a relative newcomer to the world of investing books and have been choosing my reading material based mainly on reviews (like Amazon's) and recommendations. I'm disappointed with ""High Probability Trading.""The author clearly has experience and knowledge about the subject but the writing is poor, even by investment book standards. Rather than introduce a concept, outline it logically, and present takeaways and recommendations, the book lapses into circuitous, hit-and-miss ramblings vaguely around a concept and never seems to make a clear, actionable point. I felt like I was repeatedly battered by urgent insistence that I make high probability trades (!!) without receiving much help identifying and setting up those same critical trades.If I were stranded on a desert island with only one trading book (and a live internet connection, trading platform, and quoting package, of course) I'd choose John Carter's ""Mastering the Trade."""
3,good but not great as most claim,"Firstly, this book has a poor title. There isn't much emphasis on probabilities in this book or in technical trading strategies. While some of the basics of technical analysis and charting are covered, they are not where the value in this text lies.Link's value is offered in the concept of trading and in setting realistic expectations. I would say this is a decent book for the remedial trader but most of the topics covered are done better in newer texts."
2,Another run-of-the-mill book,"I bought this book seeing high ratings. Now, I feel generous even to give two stars.One appeal for this book was author's personal narrative and his claim of a loser-turned-winner after many years of struggles. There is a gap: his ""winner"" claim is not elaborated in any detail. What is his level consistency in terms of odds and net profits? It would have been helpful had he backed up with audited results the way Morales & Kacher did in their book using O'Neils methods (which provide decent odds when trading growth stocks in up trending markets).In summary, yet another 300+ pages of run-of-the-mill trading platitudes. If you have been trading for sometime, there are no insights here. Don't bother."
3,Review of technical analysis.,"I found this book to be a good review of technical analysis. In this book the authors explains his style of trading using technical analysis with tricks on how to trade better using the big picture (longer trends) then details (daily trends) view on the stock and market. I found this book to be a good refresher of how to do technical analysis but would recommend other books for more detail on specific topics of analysis: candlestick, moving averages, etc. If you have not read about technical analysis and want to learn to a not so detailed perspective this would be a good start. I would recommend this book to beginners with some knowledge of technical analysis.Enjoy the read and good luck on the trades!"
5,Highly recommend,"When I meet someone who is curious about trading, or someone who knows they want to become a trader and need a place to start, this is the first book I recommend to them. It will give you a fantastic, down-to-earth overview on the various aspects of trading that are critical to success. If you're new to the game, read this trading book first, and any other trading book second."
2,Not High Probabilty more like basic trading,"I would re-title this book to read, ""Basic Trading Concepts"". The book is nicely put together and does provide a good deal of information but the title is totally misleading in my opinion. Most of the material provided is general trading knowledge and not specific ""high probability trading"" methods. I was expecting actual techniques and specific entry and exit systems. If you're new to trading, this book will give you the basics. If you have been trading awhile, this book is mostly milk and no meat.JD in Pennsylvania"
2,"Don't Waste Your Time, Unless..................","Central to the author's premise is that one cannot succeed if they are underfunded. Link defines underfunded as having less than 25-50k to start a trading account. While of course, the more money one has the easier it is to succeed in ANY business, it IS possible to achieve success with smaller capitalization one just needs to make smaller trades with lower priced stocks. One can still learn, and even afford to lose money it's just that their gains/losses will not initially be as substantial as a higher stakes trader. If you discover a winning strategy, remain disciplined, don't set unrealistic expectations, and don't allow yourself to become overexposed, you can succeed with a more modest account balance.Overall, a negative read. Josh DiPietro's The Truth About Day Trading Stocks was a much better read for the beginner."
3,This book covers it all,"If you're looking for an overall book on trading with every aspect clearly described, this is the right book. It contains all the important parts on trading: entries, exits, money management, a trading plan, trading psychology, ...The book is very realistically written with very practical to do lists at the end of each chapter. The author also manages to tell this stuff in a clear amusing way, also with funny stores. I had a great time reading this book and found it pretty helpful to start my trading plan and my trading setups. Most helpful to me was the chapter on money management.Some of the reviewers here claim it's all basic stuff. In a way this is true, this book does not contain any new theories, nor does it have a complete trading system to present to the reader. This book does however a great job in describing what successful trading is about and how to manage that on a daily basis. For that alone it's well worth adding it to your trading library."
5,Reading this book is a step in the right direction,"I may be biased, as I wrote the book, but I think it is a great read for anyone who is trading. As a floor trader and owner of a retail brokerage company, I was able to see what makes good traders good and what makes bad traders bad. I've outlined those differences in High Probability Trading as well as how a trader can stop making the mistakes that hurt him, while concentrating on the Money Trades. This book is an easy read and is full of funny antidotes from my trading experience. It was written to help all traders. From those just starting out to the most seasoned vet."
1,nothing concrete - somewhat rambles & repetitive,"great title but the caliber of the book is below many others describing realistic trading techniques, try others first (Murphy,Pring,Elder,Brown), they provide much more useful information you can actually adapt"
5,I just love this book!!,"This book is one of my favorite trading books. It was right after I hit a pretty huge drawdown that I started reading this book, and it gave me a clear vision of high probability trading. I took back all my losses and became consistently profitable though I still do lose, but losing is part of trading anyway...One thing, some of the strategies might be a little difficult to program for those who trade based on systems, but lots of useful ideas!! recommended!!"
4,one of the best book for a beginner and for an intermediate trader,i love this book...I think it's one of the most complete book covering every aspects of the trading.Except for price patterns such as head and shoulders and so on all the topics have been discussed in a detailed way. I found very interesting the part of the oscillators and the importance of using different time frames.In the book there are two sections dedicated how to backtest your trading ideas using a trading software.The only flaw lies in the fact that the author ofter repeat the same things all the time.
3,Repetitive,"Not bad at all. It provides some great advise about trading fundamentals and how to avoid most common mistakes. I think those messages get too repetitive and may cause you lose interest after three chapters or so. Perhaps it's in purpose, who knows."
3,"Good, but over written","This is a good book. Covers all the bases.BUT it is over written and repeats itself too much.In fairness, Mr Link does say he will repeat his material - he claims this aids the learning process. But, I personally find this a patronising statement, and I wish the book was more concise."
4,Read first before you buy,I have read first two chapters of the book from a Indigo book store in Toronto and then decided to buy. I liked what I have read by flipping trough all other chapters.Best way to buy book is not from reading reviews but by see it to yourself before putting your hard earned money on the risk. Same like trading. Analyze the chart before you enter the trade.
3,A good overall review of trading,"If you want a decent overview of trading then this book is a good choice. The author covers the basics of getting started to what tools to use, such as, the news, indicators, and breakouts. I thought the best parts of the book were the discussions on money management and the last part on Self-Control. If you are an experienced trader there are a few nuggets here."
2,From a trained trader,"The positive aspect of this book for a trader is to give him a big picture of what it is to be fairly equipped if he would like to be one day in the winning 10% of the trading world. This book really makes it clear that 90% of traders are losers and 10% winners and the winners make a living from the losers.Beside that clear concept (that will put you on the right track for a disciplined approach of the market), there is nothing really important in this book for anyone who had the opportunity to have a supervisor or head of desk. But for anyone else it's a good buy, good coaching for the on the job training."
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought the CD after reading great critics but was disappointed. It's short, no action and it's based on a single idea. My kids were bored afer 10 min and when the end came, I was still waiting for the movie to start. Yes, the pictures are beautiful and it's poetic. But it's not enough to make it work."
3,It's okay.,"We liked the movie but it is kind of amateurish with humor for adults (not distasteful, but children just wouldn't get it, like ""Et tu brute?"""
3,OK,"I LOVE ALL OF JOE LANSDALE BOOKS. I ESPECIALLY LOVE HIS HAP & LEONARD SERIES WHICH THIS IS ONE OF. This is one is the 6th in the series. It moved a little slow, but overall it was still good."
5,Good stuff,"Joe Lansdale is one of the few writers who can make me laugh till I cry. That's a rare gift, and he did it to me again with this book. Here, Lansdale keeps it going with his dynamic duo, the fairly happy-go-mostly-unlucky Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. In this story, Hap becomes a hero, gets rewarded, and he and Leonard take a cruise. To make a long story short, they end up in Mexico, where they meet a fisherman who owes a great debt; his beautiful (and dutiful) daughter; a walking gargantua, and a nudist Mexican gangster who'd like nothing more than to make a big bowl of gaucamole, with Hap and Leonard as the main ingredients.Captains Outrageous is truly outrageous and fun. I'll be looking for more from this very talented author."
5,Captain Outrageous,Hap and Leonard are at it again. The actual plot (murder etc...) gets started late in the book. But with Hap and Leonard it does not make any difference. You will laugh out loud as Hap and Leonard go from one adventure to another.
4,"Supervision of Police Personnel, Study Guide","If ""Supervision of Police Personnel"" is on the reading list for your departments Sergeant exam, I would recommend buying this study guide in place of the book. The book is excessively dry and almost impossible to get through. Recently promoted Sergeants on my department said that the questions on their test were word for word from this study guide. They recommended buying it."
1,"Outdated and of Little Use, (Comment from a concerned Sgt)","This 1994 question book is of little value. The book that it is suppose to be modeled after, ""Supervision of Police Personnel"" has changed significantly since 1994. This study guide of the past consists of confusing questions with no explanations. It is not a study guide and certainly cannot replace the text book, unless you don't mind doing poorly on a promotional exam. Since the page numbers and the chapters have changed in the actual text book, I found this book to be very frustrating. Save your mental energy."
5,Becoming a Better Basketball Player is a book away!!,"This book has it all! From Stretching, to Strength Training, to Plyometrics Power Training, to Agility Training, to Speed Training. This book delivers motivation because it is the same source the NBA players use to get in top basketball condition. This book will get you to the highest level, and more....."
3,Nice work!,This is a nice album by the Fellowship. Jon Anderson's voice is strong and beautiful in some of the songs. Recommende for Jon Anderson fans.
5,Best album of the year!,"I didn't like his past couple albums but I think Rick Astley really has grown up a lot in this one. Great music, lyrics and voice, if you like pop music has a real melody to it, this is a must-have."
2,Don't buy this version - it's a disgrace!,"If you are looking for the definitive version of this film, go for the pal region 2 disc.It's far superior to the US version. It's uncut and has both English and Cantonese soundtracks in Dolby Digital 5.1.Called ""Armour of God"", released by Hong Kong Legends ( They do a whole load of films uncut).So save your cash and import this."
3,It's a pretty good movie.,"It's not as great as later movies like five stars First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and some others. It's somewhat like a B movie and its film is maybe low quality. However, it's fun, not very, to watch. It's more like three and a half stars."
3,Disappointing.,"I own, and like, most of Jackie Chan's movies. This one has nonsense as storyline, so it causes the movie to drag-on. It is as sophisticated as a cartoon. There is plenty of action, but it is not well integrated into the story. What a shame."
1,"Without a Doubt, the Worst Chan Movie Ever","This is not a review by some uptight jerk who thinks Jackie Chan is stupid or something. I love Jackie Chan! But this is one flick he should've never made.I'm not even going to get into the plot, it was so terrible. I mean, face it, when you watch Jackie Chan, you're watching for the fighting. Unfortunately that requires watching 90 minutes of the worst movie ever made to get to 10 minutes of fighting at the end.If you want to see good fighting check out Rumble in the Bronx, or Supercop (which also had a good plot!). Don't waste the $2 rental fee."
4,"I still prefer "" Wheels on Meals ""","I wasn't a fan of Jackie Chan or action films, some of them are pretty good, though. The only reason I see it might because of Lola Forner. Along with "" Wheels.... "" are the only two films I know she's in. And she's only supporting role here, doesn't has much to do and disappear midway, since then, the story drag and went downhill, hold on to Jackie's fight scenes only. And the ending cheesy and unbelievable. I don't care about Alan and his girlfriend. Want some fun? The gay waiter is impressive."
3,Not his best work,Stunts were excellent as usual but it lacked the comedic overtones that I have looked forward to.
1,This is NOT an ORIGINAL VERSION !!!,"Jackie Chan and don't want to others enjoy his performance as well.In the US edition of ""Rumble in the Bronx"" they deleted the entire love line (it may surprised some people, but there are 2 of them in the full version).Plus, for some stupid reason, they switched the numbers in the ""Operation Condor"" movies.As well as for the ""Drunken Master"".So, if you like Jackie's movies, avoid this edition and try to get the Hong Kong one."
2,"Boaring, No wonder it didn't make it to the movie theaters.","it was nothing like the original. i wouldn't pay to rent it again, let alone buy it."
3,Operation Condor expect without most of the great elements,"This movie, although not related to the original great Operation Condor, mimics Operation Condor. It does a worst job with terrible dubbing, a loss of his great action martial arts and stunts, and a more boring storyline that doesn't make any sense. Goes good for the rental, but don't buy it. It is not worth it."
2,Bleh,"I thought ""Mr. Nice Guy"" was a little disapointing, but this is the worst yet. At least ""Rush Hour"" came out in between. I love Jackie Chan movies he keeps making them, but not ones like this.."
5,It's The Best Movie Ever Made!,"Now I have all of Jackie Chan's movies except 3(Project A, City Hunter, and Island of Fire), and out of all the movies that I have seen, this is the best! The plot is kinda like Indiana Jones, but the action, is definetely JACKIE CHAN! The best fights he's ever done are in this movie, listen to a true Jackie Chan fan, buy this movie, you won't regret it!"
4,Awesome Watch Box!,"My husband LOVED this gift! The watch box is well made and very attractive. The bonus of the watch tools was delightful. It arrived quickly and I would purchase something from this group again. My only problem was that the shipping was very high, but that was not the fault of the Watch Box company."
1,Not worth the paper ...,"Kitschmeister extraordinaire! That cover photograph is weak. That should give you a sense of what the rest are like.KTR has a bit of an eye for light but his compositions are blah. Besides, I've heard that he uses models and not dancers. So, the poses are faux.Tacky!"
5,I have always loved a pioneering spirit,"The Kilchers seem like a very honest, intriguing and down-to-earth family. I can't wait for season 2. I hope there is more about Eve's garden. I would love to see how she does it. Also, I hope to see a trip to town, with dialogue about how often they go to town and for what purposes. I'm also ready for them to publish a recipe book. Some of those meals they show look delicious.Even with the contradictions, I'm a huge fan. Eivan says he has no running water, yet he and Eve are washing a plucked chicken under a spigot of running water. He says he has no electricity, but I see solar panels on the side of his house and a power meter on the side of Atz Lee's house.Love the show!"
5,I can relate to some of this style of living,"My wife and I are avid outdoor people, we enjoy the show. The outdoor scenes are well shot and we think it is pretty accurate on how they live."
5,ALASKA LAST FRONTIED,"because they fight about everything. It's more like they are all good friends. to me its hole lot better than honey boo-boo .or any of the realty show . I would like to buy all of the d.v.d""s if i could!!!!!!!! thank for review required!"
5,very good,"it go to show people you don,t need all the morderm conveint to surve. the people get along fine !!!!"
1,Over-priced,Lowe's wanted over $200 for this item. I bought it on Amazon for around $170. If given a second chance I would not pay $10 for it.
2,"NOT 4"" long hinge pins!","These hinge pins measure 3.5 inches in length.Sadly I bought 3 packs (12 pins) believing Amazon's listing as ""4 inch hinge pins"".They are made in China, and the quality is not what it could be.The shaft of each pin feels a little rough in places, and might be difficult to insert or remove unless a little wet and dry was used on them first."
4,Great Stuff,"This is the album repeatedly mentioned in Kerouac's, On The Road,its fantastic bebop dont miss it"
4,Journals are a Picture into the Past,"In the mid 1800's Francis Parkman considered northern New England 'civilized' when he went searching for the past and the remnants of great tribes that had roamed the forests before western man arrived on the scene. From our point of view this was wilderness still in the mid 1840's. Where we drive a car, he hiked and caught rides from passing strangers in buggies and carriages but there were few rides and a hike of 2 miles was nothing in a day that covered 30 miles. Perspective is what these journals bring and the awareness that for all the changes that have come since his day, the basic challenges remain the same. A must read for the student of history. Considering that Parkman became a major history chronicler, it is fitting that his journals now provide us with the very thing he sought - personal insight into the past from those who lived through it"
4,Cathy realistically portrays many of my emotions.,"Cathy expresses many single girls'un-verbalized feelings. She represents women who wish they were married but have been hoodwinked by society's trend that marriage sells a woman short of her potential. If you are the type of person who is gung-ho about her career and personal achievement, you probably will not like this book. If you admit that women are different than men and that everyone has his/her frivolous side, then you may enjoy watching Cathy trying to figure out how best to survive."
2,$90 for a cable????,I cannot believe that they get away with charging $90 for a cable. I've heard the Aeris and Oceanic cables are the same -- look around.
5,Man knows his boccce!,I enjoyed the book very much. It was easy to read and follow the instructions. I like the use of photos for enhancement and for explainations. This history was informative but I think carried a little too much. I would recommend the book to all beginners learning to play.
4,"Good book, but lacking some critical information","While Pagnoni's book contains a lot of interesting facts about the game of bocce, it fails to mention the World Series of Bocce, a multi-day event that draws teams from several states and Canada to Rome, NY, every July. A mention -- if not some recent results and/or pictures -- would have made the book much more complete."
2,Behold Your Life,"This book was not what I expected really. It was sort of a self-help book, which I suppose Iknew from the description but nonetheless did not catch my attention."
5,Great message!,"Poor Santa,He gets fired over and over again because he hasn't yet found how to use his unique gifts. I love this book so much that I bought many of my teaching friends a copy. Great Christmas gift."
3,Decent Live JLH Recording,"Mixed bag on this recording. It's John Lee and it's live so it can't be that bad and it's not. The album is short, sound quality is poor, and backing band doesn't seem that great. The set is half with band and half solo. Jesse James is doen solo and is one of the creepiest blues tunes made. Live at CAfe Au-Au\Soledad Prison is much better if you are look for live JLH."
3,It was ok.,"Work the first couple times then started to fade and after a while only the left speakers would work. And it wasn't the speakers, they worked fine with radio and cd player. The cassette just started going out. But it was definitely worth the penny I spent. Litterlaly a penny."
1,Worst Product...DONT buy,"Worst product, don't even think to buy this. It is making hell of a noise while running and no music output. I don't know why AMAZON is encouraging vendors with low quality products to sell from their site."
1,bad.. do not suggest..,worked the 1st time ... and not since the 2nd time...I am going to return this product.
1,Not worth the 5 bucks you pay,"I bought this piece of junk thinking i would try my luck since it was only 5 bucks. Well, now i know, i should stick to the casino's if i wanna try my luck. The tape was reversing from side A to B continuosly. So, following the instructions of another user, i opened the tape and took out the black wheel next to the cassette head. That stopped the reversing, but the volume was so low you could barely hear it even after turning up the Ipod's and the Stereo's volume. I have a 30 GB Video Ipod and a Volkswagen Passat Factory installed Monsoon audio system. Do NOT buy this piece of junk, keep looking. I heard the Sony cassette adapter is good, so i'm gonna try that next. Good luck..."
1,Frustrating to use,"I have the same problem some other reviewers had: the audio was extremely low unless I manually adjust the cassette. It's not that easy - you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there, and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts. But that doesn't always work. If that doesn't work, you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit. I'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either (1) fiddling with the audio, or (2) smashing the adapter into little pieces while I drive.Hundreds of songs on the ipod and no way to listen while you drive..."
1,Junk,"Even though its only a few bucks, don't waste your money. You get what you pay for. I took a chance and thought it would be 1/2 decent at least. Well, it wasn't. It works for the 1st 5 seconds you put it in then ejects itself."
2,Product doesn't match the picture.,"It's cheap and it works, but the actual product is not as pictured. I bought it rather than some of the others here on Amazon because in the picture it has a coiled cord. The actual product as delivered does not have a coiled cord."
1,Piece of junk,"Product was $2.50, shipping was $7.50. I have a 2004 4Runner w/ CD/tape. This product works well for about 1 song and then quickly gets grainy, full of static and poor sound quality. For $10 I thought that I would gamble and hopefully come up a winner. Keep your $. The thing is junk. I don't know why it works for a moment and then doesn't but it's frustrating and fiddling with it while driving is just plain dangerous."
1,I got a defective one,"This item went on back-order right after I ordered it. It took 3 weeks to receive it and when I did get it, it didn't work. Because I wanted to have one for a long car trip, I had to go spend $20 on one at Radio Shack because this one that I ordered did not work and arrived WAY too late."
1,doesnt work at all,"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE A GOOD SONY ONE THAT IVE USED FOR LIKE 8 YEARS. SOON AS I PUT THIS ONE IN, THE TAPE STOPPED AND SAID ERROR THEN I KEPT PUTTING IT BACK IN AND I GOT REAL LOW SCRATCHY SOUNDS THEN ANOTHER TAPE ERROR SO I COULDNT EVEN GET MORE THEN 5 SECONDS OF STATIC TO COME OUT OF THIS THING. THERES A REASON WHY THIS PRODUCT WAS SOLD FOR 1 CENT AND I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS. DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,1 star because you cant choose 0 stars,"it never worked, waste of time and i thought a simple adapter would be hard to mess up but thats how poor quality it is, you get what you pay for"
1,bad quality,"What do you expect from such a cheap product? I had a hope that it would work, but of course it disappointed me."
1,static,Not even worth the cheap price. The plug hits static the second it touches & doesn't let up.Don't even get what you paid for in this case...
1,Don't do it.,"Garbage man, trust this review it didn't even last 30 days. I tried to go the cheap route and it wasn't worth it. You will be better off purchasing the samsung one from walmart or on amazon for about 8 bucks. Just saying....."
1,too big of tape for my cars stereo,"no size specifications, so i bought this cassette and its too big to fit in the slot of my 05 vw golf.now i have nothing to do with this, theres no point of sending it back as the shipping costs more than the item"
1,Piece of junk,"Don't bother wasting your money on this piece of junk. Even if it doesn't constantly keep reversing in your player, the amount of background static it produces just sitting in the player is just ridiculous. I opened it up and the wiring inside coudln't be any lower quality or cheaper. Only 1 cent for this product? You get what you pay for."
3,Not bad,"Whoever came up with the brilliant idea of designing these cassettes with the auto-reverse feature had a bad idea. There's no need for it, and when I got this my tape player kept spitting out the cassette because it couldn't figure out why it couldn't make the tape flip over. However it was simple enough to open up the tape and remove the parts that dealt with that feature. Now it works just fine. It's a fairly simple procedure and I found out how to do it by googling the problem. Apparently it's quite common...other than this hiccup the thing works fine now."
1,Don't buy ! Waste of money even if it is less,"Please don't buy this piece of junk. I used it in my car, it never worked ... and mmore over it got stuck in my player !!!! Useless piece of junk !"
2,didn't work,ahhh i already typed a review it was somehow erased.anyway my item didn't work didn't bather trading it in or anythingso i might be just my item or all of them are built faulty.you get what you pay for.
1,Won't work,"I purchased this to listen to my iPod in my car and it has not worked. I have tried inserting it different ways, holding it in the cassette player, and fiddling with my iPod, to no avail. This seems a common problem."
1,What a piece of junk!,"This is a piece of junk. It did work, but very crappy sound quality. $1.61 plus S/H = $4.59 what a waste of money. I should have brought the Sony for just $12"
3,Over the Edge of the World,"This was a good book,but could have explored in greater detail if possible. I would also recommend ""Brutal Journey"", by Paul Schneider,as it deals with a lost expedition that started in Florida with tragic conequences."
4,"Good, overall","Good book overall though I am troubled by a description of Magellan's ancestry. According to the author, on his mother's side, the family name is Mesquitas. The author suggests that that side of the family may have been Jewish because Mesquitas refers to a mosque in Spanish. Huh? Muslims pray at mosques, Jews at synagogues. The family may have been Moors, not Jews.Are there more inaccuracies?"
4,For a few cloves more - Gripping real life thriller,"This is a fascinating and gripping book which will please everybody from historians to those who love to read about how new and fascinating our world once was. The mutinies, the ruthlessness, the encounters with different cultures from sophisticated to barbarian, the horror, the courage, the tragedy and the harsh realities of how hard and unfair life can be are all in this book which depicts what undoubtly was one of the greatest feats of mankind. It now looks so simple but it wasn't. Excellent book! Just one gripe: It should have one or two more good maps so that we can follow the trip in more detail, particularly in the island maze that are the Spie Islands. Go and get it! makes fiction look tame..."
3,"Entertaining, But Accurate?","Over the Edge of the World was enjoyable but in a few places liberties seem to have been taken with the facts for the sake of excitement. For example, the names of the ships at times seemed to have been confused. However, we need more books chronicalling the feats of our famous explorers, and this one brought out the power of an extraordinary voyage."
4,Very interesting,"This was a very interesting book about a topic which I knew very little about. The rivalry between Portugal and Spain over the spice trade caused the Pope to ""split"" the Earth into two halves. The problem was than nobody knew where the borders were. The book explains Magellan's path using maps which were only approximations of where continents and islands were thought to be. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book dealt with Magellan's discovery of the Phillipines and his adventual suicidal death at the hands of the natives. The sexual exploits of the sailors and natives as well as the drudgery and hardship made this a very interesting book. I enjoyed it."
5,Awesome!,"History at its best! You learn about palace intrigue, what it took to organize a long sea voyage with limited instruments and knowledge, the politics of the time, the incredibly difficult voyage itself and the constant presence of sickness made worse by abusive captains, ignorance, prejudice and ambition. At the center are the real life characters who shaped the history of sea travel and world trade. Very well written. A must read for all."
5,"Utterly readable, I was held in thrall....","I was afraid this book would lack detail since it depicted events 500 years ago, but there was a passenger who, fortunately, became a primary source, and kept the narrative interesting. The opening scene of the book, with the ghostly ship arriving back in Spain, grabs the reader's attention, then there is a long discussion of Magellan's efforts to get the expedition funded and underway. After wading through this moderately interesting segment, the story really picks up once the armada sails. From then on, I was totally hooked and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. I highly recommend this book. It is not a dry tome, as I suspected at first, but a highly readable account of one of the most amazing voyages of all time."
4,extraordinary,"I'm sure like most people, my knowledge of Magellan was limited to knowing that he set out the circumnavigate the globe, was killed in the Phillipines, and the remainder of his crew completed the trip. This book manages to provide many, many details about the voyage and yet the story never bogs down. It's an extraordinary trip and reveals the fears, customs and conditions of that age. Highly recommended."
5,"Magellan: Tough Customer, Great Adventurer","This is a great book. It made me a little put out with my grade school teachers. How unforgivable was it for them to drone on for a couple of minutes about Magellan circling the globe, mentioning only the date we must remember for the quiz? Couldn't they have just taken fifteen minutes to tell us more about the voyage? Couldn't they have infused us with a slight taste of the tension, danger,high drama, and toughness of the men and the voyage? History is considered the most boring subject by many when it should be the most exciting class we take, and the most interesting books we read. Bergreen does a fine job on the book and it is well worth reading."
5,As exhilarating as the voyage itself,"This book makes Columbus and even Cook seem like mere amateurs in comparison. Magellan is the main man! Bergreen knows how to write the story of the great explorer with the hand of a novelist. It makes a fantastic read.As a follow-up I suggest you read the book ""1492 - The year China discovered America"". It puts things in perspective, like how did Magellan know about the strait from the atlantic to the pacific that would later bear his name?"
4,A little tedious sometimes but totally exciting/interesting,"This book is perfect for those who are interested in either historical accounts of exploration and adventure... or those who are fascinated by the perils of life on the sea. What I personally loved about this book was the detailed accounts of the people, places, and situations Magellan's fleet encountered on their journey to circumnavigate the globe. The writer, Bergreen, obtained his info from a diary kept by one of Magellan's crew members named Pigafetta. I believe that Bergreen's story was extremely accurate, easy to understand and follow (altho maps would definitely have helped), and it was full of action and adventure with mutinies, torture, hurricanes, shipwrecks, cannibals, and much much more!"
2,Plodding and conventional,"The fascinating story of Magellan is not told with much style, intuition, or technical knowledge here. The author is quick to invoke a 21st century tut-tut whenever Magellan is not sufficiently sensitive to the natives, which must make him feel good, but adds nothing to our understanding of the time. Lots of digressions into fairly uninteresting matters fill out the book, apparently to conceal a lack of specific information on many of the events of the voyage. No original thoughts, research, or insights. No feel for the seaman's life, such as we might get from Patrick O'Brian or someone else with a solid understanding of the subject matter."
4,Truth Stranger than Fiction,"Another example of how your history teacher lied to you - or at least, left out a whole lot of stuff. Amazingly, everyone has heard of Magellan, but I would be willing to bet that few people know more than ""he circumnavigated the world"" - a statement that is technically false, since he actually died about halfway through the voyage. Anyway, a great read - portions of this book are mystifying, as if you are reading Gulliver's Travels or some other old fiction. The ignorance of the Europeans during the Age of Discovery is willful and tragic. Still, you can't deny that Magellan opened up the modern world and destroyed ancient perceptions."
4,A good book,A lot of research was done to put this story together. I wish the author had foregone some of the politics leading up to the voyage itself. I believe the book is a little too bogged down in the politics of the time; I would like to have concentrated more on the aspects of the voyage itself. But all in all it appears very factual and I learned a whole lot about an expedition in which I have always had a lot of interest. I definitely would recommend the book to anyone with an interest in early exploration.
3,Over the Edge of the World,"I found this book to be, on the whole, solidly written and adequately researched, (although the authors morbid preoccupation with trying to find homosexual tendencies in every aspect of the crew's actions was not a little disconcerting, it makes one feel as though the author had an ""agenda"" here).The book does, however, give the reader a good understanding of the who, what, when, where and why's of the voyage, and leaves you with a feeling of now being ""grounded"" in what is generally a very sketchy subject. Worth the read."
3,Decent use of source material with some flaws.,"Makes use of much of the same source material as Tim Joyner's Magellan, but with some expanded coverage of the world at large. My biggest annoyance is some condescending Western political correctness about Asia. The fact that the West was more rapacious than China is without question, but the assertion that China always believed that everyone should rule themselves, that conquest was wrong is comical. As a Korean, I know the 3,000 year record of Chinese invasions of Korea, Tibet, Indochina and certain areas of China which were formerly independent and are now part of China. China is morally superior to the West, but it is a RELATIVE superiority, not an absolute one. There is a difference. Also, Chinese merchants visiting the Philippines made everyone near water literate? A few local merchants gaining literacy is all there is real evidence of.Anyway, this book or Joyner's are valuable reading on a significant figure in world history."
3,"I SUFFERED, TOO.","Good history, my god, the primative conditions of early sailing, politics much as today; truely an epic voyage. Dragged at times. These were real men."
1,Book Needs A Good Editor,"Sometimes the story here just drags like an anchor in the water. The book needed a professional editor who cared about the subject matter more. There needs to be more story telling, more life to the subject matter. In the end the book was dull."
3,Great facts but overly glossy and speculative,"I did enjoy this book and was glad to learn the facts of Magellan's voyage. Perhaps the author suffers from a lack of historical information but I found that there was a lot of speculation on his part as to what was going on day to day. Many times he imparts what the crew was feeling where I don't imagine he had the foggiest as to their true motivations.This is in juxtapostion to the Nicholas Thomas book on Cook""Cook: The Extraordinary Voyages of Captain James Cook"", which is much more professionally written. Thomas will talk about the motivation of the crew when he in fact has a source for it. If he does speculate, he says so.There were also some factual inconsistencies. For instance, whether Magellan's allies cut the anchor line of the mutineers ship in the Port of St. Julian. Initially he says they did, but later he refers to them dragging their anchor.As another reviewer said, it's hard not to make this story compelling however. It's worth the read."
3,"Interesting, But No Maps.","This is an interesting book and did increase my knowledge of Magellan and his achievements, however, one improvement could have really enhanced the experience of reading this book:MAPS. It was very frustrating not to have any clear and detailed maps to help us understand the route the armada took. There event isn't a map of the Strait of Magellan. The NASA picture is of no help. I constantly had to refer to other sources to find my bearings regarding where in the world the story was taking place."
5,Outstanding History of the Magalhaes Voyage trough the undiscovery world,"OUTSTANDING HISTORY ;The author based the book on the diary of the most important source , trough all the circumnavigation voyage , PigaFetta diary . The diary , persuades the rider to live , in those times of discovery ,the unknown lands and oceans , plus the hard times faced by Ferno de Magalhaes (Portuguese Name of the command in chief of the expedition ) ,and his crew , with the problems he had to overcome with the representatives of the Spanish king. Beyond this , the deseases , lack of fresh food and proteins , killed almost all the crew of 250 men .I advise every one interested in the history of the discoveries to read this book .In a word ,an awsome book ."
5,Incredible Story,"This book is an engrossing read of an incredible undertaking, the first known circumnavigation of the globe. The authorship is first-class history. No need to make anything up to make in interesting and compelling to read. The expedition and the people involved speak for themselves. A must read for anyone interested in the Age of Discovery."
5,"Astounding story, wonderfully written","All the stuff your 11th Grade History class overlooked!A thoroughly readable book, (I've been through it three times now), full of pathos, intrigue and death-defying moments. Magellan hadn't even LEFT the harbor on his audacious attempt to sail around South America to Asia before the King of Spain and all Magellan's backers had already abandoned him as a traitor. Unbelievable!An incredible story, beautifully written, that involves the reader with important flashes into life (and death) during the early 1500's.Get this one."
3,Hits and waaaay long shots,"Bob Dylan's songs are truly world music. They speak to all cultures, but for the most part, I like Dylan doing Dylan best. I loved all four of the new Bob Dylan songs. ""Down in the Flood"" and ""Cold Irons Blue"" are my two favorite of the four.For me, the standout was Shirley Caesar doing the cover of ""You Gotta Serve Somebody."" It's outstanding and the one song that's gotten a lot of play in this house.Los Lobos does a great job of ""On a Night Like This,"" giving the song a romantic Latino flair singing part of the lyrics in Spanish. I probably would have liked the Jerry Garcia cover of ""Senor"" better, if it weren't live.The Italian (rap) version of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is a big miss for me. So's the opening ""My Back Pages"" in Japanese. This is somewhat anomalous since I love world music and different language covers.Give the songs a listen before you buy this. If you're a strong Dylan collector, the CD is a must.Rebecca Kyle, June 2008"
3,Dylan tunes: What's missing from the movie...,"In the movie Masked and Anonymous, there are 9 live Dylan tracks used in the movie, yet only 4 appear on this ""soundtrack."" Songs that are MIA on the CD include 5 others (!): ""I'll Remember You"" and ""Drifter's Escape"" (both of which Dylan and the boys are filmed playing), but also absent is a killer ""Blowin' In the Wind,"" which rolls during the final scene and the credits. Also missing are the songs ""Watching the River Flow"" and ""Dirt Road Blues"" (both were listed in the credits, but I personally did not recognize in the movie...instrumentals perhaps?). The Dylan songs that did make it onto the CD are all phenomenal (especially if you are a fan of Love and Theft), but this soundtrack really could have been something special."
3,Disappointing,"Among the 4 new Dylan songs, ""Down in the Flood"", ""Diamond Joe"", and ""Cold Irons Bound"" are quite good; almost but not quite up to the level of the songs on ""Love and Theft"".""Dixie"" is painful to listen to; yes, it's the old ""Wish I was in the land of cotton"" song. It's about as painful as the songs on Dylan's worst albums (""Self Portrait"" and ""Saved"").The rest of the album is filler... covers of Dylan songs. Some are quite good (""Most of the Time"" performed by Sophie Zelami and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" sampled and in Spanish) and some are not so good (""Senor"" by Jerry Garcia is disapppointing, surprisingly so).All in all, a mixed bag. About 1/8 of the CD is excellent, almost 1/2 is OK to good, and about 1/4 is painfully bad."
2,Disappointing and no new songs,"As a long tim Dylan fan I was hoping for more. The opening track in Japanese is a neat novelty but wears thin fast. The""new recordings"" from Dylan are not new songs but new versions of two of his tunes and two covers. The cover of Dixie is really pathetic and in general he sounds like doesn't care on the other tunes either.They included Garcia's cover of Senor, which has been around a long long time and a few others that are quite weak.If you want a good Dylan cover CD, buy the new Gospel cover disc."
3,Good but not great...,"Good players on this CD. There's alot of guitar compilations out there and although this one is good, it may lack some consistency."
3,OK,I bought this on the fly without much research. The audio quality is OK and if you are interested in any of the artists listed go for it.
5,just superb,Christy Lane has a voice that works for both spiritual and secular Christmas music. This CD cover a wide range of both types. You can't go wrong.
4,Beautiful Shoes!,"These are gorgeous. For being such a high heel, they are reasonably comfortable. They look very classy on. I love them. I have two pairs. One in black and one pair in brown."
5,So Enjoyable,Gerald Lund writes his books in a way that it is so easy and enjoyable to read. I read all nine of The Work and the Glory and I read all three of The Kingdom and the Crown books. These books have fictional characters mingling with real people who once lived. It is an amazing and very impressionable way to tell a story.
5,You can't put this one down.,"Simply put, this book was great. It was loaned to me shortly after my own baptism, however, I didn't take the time to read it for almost a year. I'm not usually one to enjoy reading ""historical"" types of stories, but once I started, I was amazed at how much this one captured my interest and helped my understanding. It's a great novel, and I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent way to learn lds history,"This book was wonderful I can remember the wonderful feeling I had reading it. I couldn't put it down. I have read all 9 volumes, and each one is so exciting. I just couldn't put them down once I started. This book helped me to learn more about the prophet Joseph Smith and his struggle in bringing forth the restoration. This is a book that can be enjoyed by member and non-members. I think it really teaches a lot along with being very entertaining."
5,The Work and the Glory books have been a light for me.,"Thank you so much, Mr. Lund. I have read the series 2 times already in the past year and have to stop myself from reading them again. I love your books and the Work and the Glory have taught me so much about this wonderful church. I have gotten to know Joseph Smith so much and want to know him in person one day. I feel like I know the Steed family and have come to better appreciate what the Saints have gone through and done for us. Thank you!"
1,Love the movie! Hate the DVD! Edited for male nudity!,"BEWARE THIS DVD IS EDITED. THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE YOU SAW AT THE THEATER!!!!!!!!!!Love this movie. Great performances. Aidan Quinn is fantastic. He gives a heart-breaking performance , but this dvd is edited. In the shower scene the dvd is cropped tight.I have the version that was shown on HBO and it is not the same.I saw the movie at the theater. I know what I saw.I will be returning this DVD.WHY THE CENSORSHIP???????????????????????????????????"
3,"Great movie, spectacularly overpriced DVD","I'd love to own this movie, but there's no way it should be over $10.00. Granted, there are very few movies that should be over $10.00."
5,Finally released on DVD- an 80's classic!,"I have been waiting for this DVD release for years now, and just found out it was released on 10/12/09. I have not viewed this DVD version yet, so I can only recommend this title for its iconic portrayal of a small town guy who dreams of breaking the mold he is cast in. Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah give their characters great depth, and James Foley's direction is spot-on. This film is visually stunning, and has a fantastic indie soundtrack. This was the noir predecessor to Prince's Purple Rain, and is the better version of the ""guy gets girl and they ride out of small town on motorcycle"" story. Great movie on many levels-I can't wait to own it!"
5,I am now the proud owner of this DVD due the fact that I could order it from Amazon.,I have watched this movie so many times on TV and decided I would like to add it to my collection so I could watch it again and again when I felt like it. It was not possible to obtain it in my country and that is where Amazon came in. It is a feel good movie about growing up and also experiencing that life is not always a bed of roses and the choices you must make. I am also a fan of Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah and they were the perfect combination for this movie.
4,Reckless,"I really liked it. Now that we look back to where we come from, it's easy to relate to the characters."
4,Reckless and wanting more out of life,"I've had this movie on VHS for about 20 years and never saw it on DVD prior to doing a search on Amazon. Great flick highlighting teen angst of the early 80's with a backdrop of a gritty decaying steeltown. Aiden Quinn is awesome and Daryl Hannah never looked better. Everyone knows Splash, but this was the movie she made just before it. If you've seen the show Chuck, you'll get a kick seeing a much younger Adam Baldwin. Soundtrack showcased many early 80's bands like Romeo Void which also was a highlight for me. Good movie. I was hoping it would be released in Blu ray, but not yet."
3,Not bad for crime buffs,"Typical Reader's Digest fare. None of the stories - articles, really - provide particular depth, but despite this nearly all the cases are interesting. The prose occasionally tends toward the hyperbolic, but that's easily taken in stride.Crime buffs will have find this enjoyable. Be advised, of course, that is you subscribe to Reader's Digest, you've probably read all of these.Jerry"
1,Some IMPORTANT DETAILS are OMITTED. They left me UNSATISFACTORY due to unanswered questions.,"Some IMPORTANT DETAILS are OMITTED. They left me UNSATISFACTORY due to unanswered questions.- The book is beautifully printed with glossy paper and colored and black-and-white photos. Each story has more than 2 photos.- It contains 26 stories from page 8 to 350. So, on the average, each has 13 pages.- Many times they annoyed me because they left me with unanswered important questions. For example, in the story, titled ""Silent Witness"", the author wrote suspected rapist David Frediani were convicted twice. He appealed the verdict twice and won. There was no explanation why he won the appeals. This is a crime, not a novel. The reason for acquitting is very important here. Yet, the book does not bother with it.In short, this book is not worth reading in terms of true crimes."
5,The Best She's Ever Written!,"Susie Bright is the most interesting writer we have when it comes to sex. She's funny, irreverant and wildly untamed and original. Lots of great information in this book!"
2,Disappointing,"I like Susie Bright and wanted to enjoy this book but it's just an aimless collection of rants. A few interesting tidbits hidden in the rough but not worth digging for. I certainly don't feel like I'm any closer to ""opening up to my sexual creativity and erotic expression."""
5,Healthly Attitude,"A very interesting author wrote this book. She significantly points out how we do limit our sexuality and how we can expand our thinking of our own sexual beings and this is perfectly OKAY! The author is very sensible and quite funny and this was really enjoyable reading. She explains it what we know in our hearts to be true about truth and sex and living and dealing with both. This book was very open, intelligent and honest and spoke of the sexual issues we should be discussing with our own partner and they should be the one listening"
1,Not very good,"This seems like a cheezy rip-off of all the ""Soul"" books, like Care of the Soul, Seat of the Soul, Soul of Sex, etc. They take a lot of words to say a little bit of nothing."
5,A good sexual attitude primer with heart and intelligence,I found this book to be well written and very thoughtful. Bright has some supperb insight into sexual attitudes. This book might bore the already initiated but would make an excellent ground breaker for the the majority of people who give little serious thought to our antiquated sexual attitutes. Would make a good textbook for Sexual Attitude Re-assessment 101 classes.
5,A True Guide to Smart Sexuality,"Hearing the audio version of this book read by Susie herself made this great book even better. As full of humor as it is wisdom, I highly recommend it to anyone in search of an intelligent sexual philosophy. It's definitely a thinking persons guide to smart sexuality."
4,"Ewwww, stinky goodness! :)","This book is really cute! It's about a little girl who is very strong-willed and knows *exactly* what she wants! She isn't afraid to be herself, or to wear what she likes, regardless of what everyone else thinks. This attitude is something we try to instill in our daughters, so that they won't be afraid to think outside the box, or to be their own person no matter what ""everyone else"" is doing. However, those socks are putrid! LOL. We had fun trying to imagine how long it would take for *us* to get smelly socks, and whether or not her shirt would end up the same way. It was a lot of fun to read, even if I didn't totally fall in love with it (I mean, it has given my children ideas... found that one of my children was hiding *her* fave pair of socks under her pillow each night! YIKES!). But again, it's extremely cute and we enjoyed reading it!"
2,Not my cup of tea I guess,"I really did not find anything original or humorous in the story. There is a bratty, demanding girl who insists that her grandfather row across the river to buy her socks. When she stubbornly refuses to wash them, people and animals react in an exaggerated manner until her friends take the matter into their hands. The reviews sounded great but I probably will donate this book to the library. No it isn't a princess story but it could still have someone with redeeming qualities."
2,"while it may be a funny book, I will not approve it for my young child","The book is definitely funny and enjoyable even for an adult. But as a mom, I do not approve this for my young child because the hidden message of the story is not positive to any young person. At the end of the story, the young girl kiddingly said that if she waited long enough, her friends at school would clean her clothes for her. While it sounds very funny and she is most likely only joking, it conveys the idea that ""if one waits long enough OTHERS WILL DO THINGS FOR THEM"". I would much rather pick other funny books that will teach my child positive values/characters at the same time."
5,A refreshingly funny book,"Smelly Socks is the story of a young girl, Tina, who loves her colorful new socks so much that she refuses to take them off, leading to some hilarious consequences.This is a tall tale that will appeal to young children who, like Tina, often have a favorite piece of clothing that they want to wear all the time. Some of the lines in the book repeat, and children can participate in the telling of the story.The book is also a very realistic and refreshing look at little girls. Tina is a spunky child, a real girl whose socks smell when she doesn't take them off! It is something different from the ubiquitous dainty princess paraphernalia. This book is a must-have for every little girl's library. The watercolor illustrations are expressive and support the story very well."
4,Grammy to 9 - 6 girls,"It's great to find books for girls that give them an alternative to the princess personna that is prevalent even today. I'm glad my granddaughters have choices like this book along with the more traditional ""girl"" stories that are still much in evidence today."
5,Family fave!,"We love Robert Munsch, and Smelly Socks is outrageous and silly, just like we hoped! Super fun, great pictures, good family reading material."
3,"Ok... Fun, but crappy","So I recieved my guns after two weeks, and they came assembled and in good condition with some bb'sright away my friend and I started using them, and they seemed to be working fine. Then the next day in the morning I was shooting at a target and a piece snapped off inside, when I took the gun apart I found it it was the piece that holds the gun when cocked had broken off. It was a tiny plastic piece that holds like 10lbs of pressure...The other gun is fine with no problems so far except that it curves upward a little.Surprisingly tiny..Cons...Cheap plastic, no metal partsCurved shootingSmall clip (9 pellets)Pros...Really fun to play withDoesn't hurt, but shoots 30ftEasy to take apart and put together"
1,guns are sturdy but not worth buying,These guns are quite sturdy but do not shoot well. One of our guns broke the first time we cocked it back. My sons were really disappointed in these guns. We decided it is worth paying a little bit more for a better gun.
1,"If you like crap, buy these guns.","(This is by Norman's 13 year old son.)All I can say is that this product stinks and Amazon should be ashamed to be selling it. I got this for christmas and it was fun at first, but then the silver gun was defective and broke after being used less than 1 day. It wouldn't cock back right, it wouldn't shoot, and the magazine wouldn't come out. One day later I dropped the black gun a few feet off the ground and the same problem happened to it. They were also very, very small and only shot 9 bb's in one magazine."
5,EPIC!!!!!!!,"I got this gun on 4-21-11 and i ordered 2 of them and got 4 of them. one of the black guns broke and wont work besides that they are AWESOME! They are a lot bigger than i expected and holds 9 bb,s with one in the chamber i would recomend these if you bye 2 sets of them for 20$. BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Kinda cheap,"I bought these for my 11 yr. old son. I new they were probably cheaper by the price, but we tried them anyhow. He has had them about a month and they were both broken a week ago. They do not stand 'wear and tear' that a younger child will put them through. They might last longer for an adult who may treat them better. They are cheap, cheap plastic and the silver one was scratched when we received it."
3,Not the greatest guns,"I thought these guns looked nice. I got them and the case was broken beyond repair. Not even a week after having them the black gun broke and had to be thrown away, i'm hoping the silver one does not break!! These guns are not the greatest quality!"
2,"fun to play around with, but they are useless otherwise","These shoot about 50 ft and are very inaccurate, useless except for inside. I was playing with my brother and a shot at him directly from, 10 ft while a was standing still and it spun to the side. not very good, but I spray painted mine with some gold and they look SICK!!!"
2,You get what you pay for,"If you're looking for tough, reliable guns, THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT. They arrived on schedule but one of them never worked. The slide pulled back okay but it wouldn't stay cocked. The other lasted for a few days before the slide fell off. It never worked again. They're fun for a short time but are junk."
2,Prop,Black pistol is broken. Not pictured is the horribly painted on black tip. Orange paint was smudged all over it. Re-painted them my self. Good for video props.
1,These guns SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These guns suck because they broke in 2 days! Me and my friend were having and airsoft war against each other and then my pistol's top fell off!!!!!! i know i coked it fine cuz im not weak or anything and then i tried to fix it but then the rest of it colapsed and broke into pieces!!!!!!! about an hour later the other pistol broke from coking it RIgHT, people i know fur sure me and my freind cock pistols always carefully and smoothly so it want our fault it was the dang sellers fAULT FOR SELING CRAPPY GUNS!!!!!"
2,BAD PRODUCT.,These pistols are horrible. they are cheap plastic and are tiny! so i wouldnt recoment it but if u want it so bad..... alright
4,A Good Pair of Guns,"Even though mine are broekn now, i still think these are cool. Not the must powerful, but effective at VERY close range. Magazines hold about 9 shots and it's easy to conceal these sidearms. They're cheap, fun, and worth the money if you keep them in good shape, i say, it's worth the 8 bucks to buy."
3,ok,"This gun is not very acurate, and doesnt hurt at all. And besides on [...] you can get the same pack [...], so all in all, dont buy inless you are looking at having fun with you and yourself shooting eachother all day and not feel a thing."
1,flimsy piece of junk fell apart in 3 days,"1 of the guns stopped working the day after I got it. On the third day, the black gun fell apart. This is lousy. Don't buy it."
5,Not for Wars but really fun to play with!,"I bought the silver gun from my gas station (!) and I must say for a pack of two at seven bucks you get a really good deal. My friends and I just have traditional 18th Century Duels and just mess around with them. Got an annoying sibling? Keep this gun handy. It has good range, but doesn't hurt. I shot myself in the bare hand and it only stung for about 3 seconds.This is a must buy for the hardcore airsofters (like me) or the beginners."
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!,i got this for just a fun thing for friends and i to do but this thing was bork be for i eve got to fire the guns!!! try to get a new on and they did sand it out but wan i open the box up it was the wog thing!!!!
2,THe worst way to spend 12 bucks,I advise not to buy this crappy gun. THe silver one broke after the first cock. i was very disappointed... both the guns release several bullets everywhere with only one shot.. The bullets practically fall out of the guns. They are made of cheap quality material and i would not recommend buying them.. but if you like crap then go ahead.
4,cool,"this gun is good 4 back up.its small,shoots short(.25g bbs,not safty,9 round clips,and all plastic.i hve had mine 4 about 3weeks and thay are still good not broken they could be better.i would buy a nother later.u can get i for $[...] [...] and they have other good deals check it out."
2,"Small, fun, but cheaply made","They are small and not very powerful but they are fun to shoot. However, one of the guns stopped working after only a few weeks of use, and really, not a lot of use in that time. Only on weekends. I took it apart and saw that the main plastic piece that creates the locking mechanism had broken. It was a very thin piece of plastic and it's obvious it can't last very long. I expect the other gun to fail pretty soon too."
2,Simple and Cheap.,"So here's the deal, i got my guns a few days after i ordered them and after unwrapping i found that they were very small but easy to handle and reload.unfortunately,one broke about three weeks later when i pulled the trigger after cocking one of the guns, the whole top part of the gun flew off and would not get back on. a few days after that the other one broke too."
3,It's decent,If u take care of them they won't break but they would last u 2 weeks and they would break
1,Small gun but great power,"This package comes with one silver and one black gun, both small in size. But they have great power and for the price that you buy them for they are pretty good, but after about a half hour it broke, it exploded when I shot it. Its really cheaply made. Also they come in a case with a small pouch of about 50 bbs. I loved these guns at first but i wouldnt get it again. I say that you should buy it only if you want at your own risk. They are cheaply made and only has a 9 bb mag not 12 like it says."
1,BAD!,DO NOT BUY THESE! I bought them and I shot them 2 times then the triggers broke. Do not get these! Waste of money!
4,back up and break,hen i got it i used it right away. the next day we were playing airsoft and it broke something fell off inside i took it in the house carefully took it apart and a piece fell off. so i get my tools out and repair it the black one is the best hurts and doesnt break. id say easy to repair.
1,not a very good set,"not very good. when i opened these the first magazine i took out broke. but once i fixed it they were ok. the problem was the magazines only take 6-7 shots, and unless your 2 feet away from your target, the sights dont work. very cheasy, unless you are wanting to play airsoft with 3 year olds, i wouldnt recomend this product.:("
3,Ehhhh....,"They shipped quickly, arrived, my friend and I opened it for the first time, and the case broke. I thought, ehhh who cares, its the guns that matter. I load in the bbs, and first shot; it jams. I recommend not using the bbs it comes with, they are very cheaply made and jam easily. After unjamming them, we preceded to have TONS of fun with them. Also, for some reason bbs get stuck on the left side of the top, this happens when it is held back for too long when you pull it back to cock it and more than one bb enter the chamber to fire."
2,Terrible,"Do not waste your money. I bought these, and the first day I got them I cocked one of the guns back, and the top part- which is plastic, as is about everything else- snapped in half. The spring came flying to my left and almost hit my friend. The BB's in the clip went out and spilled everywhere. I gave the other gun and the package to my sister, and a few times after she shot it, it happened to her too. I didn't want them anyway, because when I saw her shoot them, the sight was horrible. The ONLY thing I would recommend this is for very, VERY close ranged combat... if it doesn't break."
1,it sucks,My friend and I bought this from some shady guy at a Japanese market and they both broke within a week. The bbs that come with it are extremely low quality. I have to admit it was fun for awhile but they just weren't powerful enough to go over like 30 feet. If you are thinking about getting these for your first guns DONT they really just aren't worth it.
4,AWESOME!,I got these guns a few days ago and they are AWESOME. I went somewhere to shoot some targets and wow they shoot far. Even tho the plastic is a little cheap it was totally worth buying. So yeah i recommend these.
1,this gun sucks,I amnot cgcats1 thats my moms profile name i bought these for the price and after 5 minutes a small piece broke of of both of them. then theye strted to jam a bunch and i had to take them apart to see whate was up with it. the stupid piece of crap gets bb's jammed in the barrel. they suck DO NOT BUY! i have a lot of airsoft guns but none this crapy. my recomendation is to buy a softair brand airsoft gun. no i am not saying airsoft gun im saying a gun made by softair the brand. after these broke i went and got a taurus co2 pistol wich is made by softair.DO NOT BUY THESE TWO PISTOLS!!!!!!
2,DO NOT BUY!!,ok i bought these guns not for me but so that i could resell them to friends and one of the guns broke because of a jam. i hear that usually the silver one breaks more easily but in my case it was the black one. anyways this is a waste of money because of the shipping.it starts out as like around 7 bucks wen u add the shipping to it this is NOT worth 13 bucks ur better off buying one good gun than these 2 terrible ones. I mean they are fun to just shoot around because they dont hurt but maybe will sting if point blank.But the point is this is not worth ur money.
1,wort peaces of crap ever,"i got theys guns in the mail and when i opened the packaging i noticed emeadyitly that they were made of cheep plastic. i then picked them up and tried to lode them, when i pulled them back it felt like it was going 2 break. ofter 10 minutes i knowticed that the paint was rubbing off on my hands. finally at the 30 minutes mark they both broke and i sent them back. so that what i know, i had them for 30 minutes and they broke."
2,Who's afraid of Saul Bellow?,"I'm a big fan of John Steinbeck, Hemingway and Falconer...But over the years I've made three attempts to read this book.My first impression was it was just a lot of mumbling proseand not very interesting. My second impression was that it was deeply depressing.My last impression is that it just isn't worth the effortto sort through the depressing stuff to get to the interesting pornof a black guy showing his privates to a half blind old Jewish man.Something is pretty wrong in literature when this is given a prize?"
2,Good quality but songs are incomplete,I really like Cumbia. This is great music and the sound quality is really good but the songs are incomplete. They only last about 2 minutes. I would not recommend this album.
3,Ian Hunter: Overnight Angels,"Good (not ""great"") but still, a welcome addition to my Ian Hunter collection. Opens with a real upbeat ""Golden Opportunity"" that has a bit of the feel of Mott The Hoople's ""Crash Street Kids"".The ballads/quieter songs here are atypical of Ian's melodic style and still have some echoes of older, better known material. Nothing stands out with the so very open and honest/heartfelt lyrics and impact of, say ""Irene Wilde"", but these are still good songs from Ian!The title track and ""Justice Of The Peace"" (upbeat and fun!), ""Miss Silver Dime"", and ""Wild And Free"" (another rocker) are among my favorites here. And the additional vocals on ""Justice"" reminded me of ""Marrionette"".Many of us are well aquainted with live version of ""Cleveland Rocks"" played on classic rock stations, so the bonus track ""England Rocks"" is a gem to get here. I liked the CD on it's first listen, but after two or three playbacks, it became one I was glad I found."
2,"Poor vendor,good product",I choses this rating purely on the service. It look 4 weeks to get my candles when that were supposed to arrive in a week. When i inquired about where they were I got no response.Order this product from another vendor
5,love this brush,"The vendor package and shipped the brush in a timely manner, faster than expected. The brush is a NARS brush not a knock off and is well made. It applies the bronsing powder in a nice soft finish. Love this brush!Love Amazon! :)"
4,Interesting,"Fallaci's weaknesses are also her strengths. She's so passionate a journalist, you get a rush off her energy. But her passion also clouds her objectivity, so she seems often fanatical in her opinions and attitudes. If you want to experience the equivalent of reading an arm-waving passionate Italian, this is a worthy book."
5,Slip Roll,"We purchased this last month for our industrial commercial shop. It is well built and was packaged great. Arrived by freight in about two weeks on a pallet and we received ""NO"" shipping charge. Impossible to beat this price. We have used it a few times and our seasoned machinists say it works great!"
5,Not just for Kids!,"The publisher has unfortunately tried to market these fabulous works as childrens books (not that they aren't wonderful for kids as well), but these photos are truely amazing both in the quality of the photography, but also in the presentation. They are printed on very high quality coated paper with a STURDY set of lenses built right into the hard cover, which allows you to view them in all their splendor without any additional equipment.These are not red/blue lenses! The images are presented in true color stereo pairs and when viewed, merge into a single, dynamic 3D image - WOW! I can't say enough about the overall quality of viewing for ADULTS as well as children.The price is another thing that confuses me. I don't know why these are so inexpensive? I urge anyone who loves photography to buy all of the books in this series!"
3,A bit dissapointed....,"I bought this book to round out my collectiom of Mark Blum 3-D books. The others are exceptional. This book is physically smaller than the others and the images are also about 1/3 smaller. My main complaint with this book is that it is basically an advertisement for Caterpillar. The text mostly consists of the capabilities of the equipment. The photos are technically OK, but not all have pizzaz. My guess is that this was meant to be a gift for Cat shareholders and executives. It's hard for me to give one of Mark Blum's books anything but a five, but I feel it's neccesary here."
4,1 of the best of 3,"This is one of the best double cd's out the 3 best. The other two being 2pac ""all eyes on me"" and Biggie ""life after death"". This cd can easily be compared to both of those. It has dope lyrics, beats, flow, right amount of guest, and both cd's are bangin.A lot of people slept on this because it did not get mainstream exposure, but it is truly a good album. Out of both disc i may skip two songs. The guest on this cd is amazing, people from all coast are on here. I promise if you even semi like 8Ball u will like this album. Hotep!!"
2,"Eightball ...has he ""Lost"" it?","I did not order this one through Amazon but, if you have read any of my other reviews then you know, I am an 8 Ball & MJG die hard fan! I know, this cd came out a few years back but I am just getting around to reviewing it. Anyway, this was the solo album for 8 Ball and it really is not as hott as the others. Yeah, it has a track or two but nothing to write home about. I would not suggest picking it up unless you just want to complete your collection. Sorry to say, but Lost gets no airplay in the ride. YMMV. NEOSOUL06."
4,A Great Tribute,"This 3-disc set is a fantastic overview of a great progressive German band. It contains 2 feature-length films (a documentary and a portrait), a 52 minute live concert, numerous biographies and an historical essay. Plus a short film by Brian Eno. The third disc is comprised of recent material by the band members (albeit individually). I love Can and I love this DVD! If you don't, you probably won't."
1,This Vacuum is HORRIBLE,I really hate this vacuum. I've had mine for 3 years and it's been broken for half that time. The motor melts the belts and the damn thing gets clogged after only cleaning one room in our 4 bedroom house.I hate this and I'm throwing mine away to buy a better one.
1,The worst piece of junk there is,I would never buy a hoover again. this is the second type of hoover I have bought recently that never worked
1,DO NOT PURCHASE HOOVER VACUUMS,"HOOVER HAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BELTS STRETCHING OUT ON ALL THE SELF PROPELLED VACUUMS, BUT WIL DO NOTHING FOR CUSTOMERS STUCK WITH THEM! WE MUST REPLACE THE DRIVE AND PROPEL BELTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. REDICULOUS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
2,Between the lines,"Essentially Lynn Grabhorn makes some very insightful observations and points, however her ability to relay that information is somewhat limited. Her text is poorly written and poorly edited and she is also very, very repetitive. She must work for the department of redundency department. :) If you can look past the poorly written text, push through and read the book, the essence is very insightful and could be of much benefit."
2,OK but how many times the same thing,"About the power of positive thinking, but lets not call it magic. Examples were quite repeditive. I am sure positive thinking will you a better person but I don't believe it will keep your dog from barking. Suprised it got a 4+ star rating from Amazon, maybe the people who didn't like it didn't rate it?"
1,I'd give it no stars if I could,"This is a repetitive re-hash of the same old positive thinking theme with a magnetic twist. Don't waste your money. (Uh-oh, I probably just created some bad ju-ju for myself.)"
1,Use Caution!,"I love books that have a life-changing effect and I am open to new ideas. I just don't get this book though. I bought it based on the reviews and was sorely disappointed. I would recommend purusing this book in the bookstore first before buying it and I believe you will put it back on the shelf and move on. However, if you have a lot of time on your hands, and have time to go to the max with ""touchy feely"" concepts you might be able to get through it. It is in my home library, on the shelf and will probably stay there until it gets crowded out by worthwhile books."
4,Trying to be positive in a negative environment,"My work and home environment can be very negative and it is hard to keep a positive attitude and realized that with time my attitude has become very negative as well. I found that this book helped me realize that everyone elses negativity didn't have to ruin my day or life as well, you don't realize how much you take on others problems by just listening and I feel now I can listen without it causing me to fall into that same dumpy feeling. I still struggle with being negative but I catch myself more often now and try to change and atleast try not to pay it forward."
5,Just Do It,"If you really want to get your life together, back on track or you just want to elevate from where you are to another level of prosperity and spiritual growth, read this book. The author not only deals with the problem, but offers workable solutions through exercises that only take the time to focus your energy into them. If you're looking for a better way of life, read and reread Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting, because it is."
5,"Lynn, so long, will see you soon enough","I just learned that Lynn Grabhorn, the author, died in May '04. I never met her, but her work sure has helped and inspired me, especially this book ""Excuse me..."".She has a farewell message to her friends, family & fans at her website - lynngrabhorn.com."
5,"you have the power to change your life, right NOW!","This is an incredible book for learning how we attract things into our life. Most of us don't realize how much power we do have and Lynn teaches us how emotions are the key creating a life worth living. So stop your blaming, complaining, and living without what you truly desire. Just Read the book and GO FOR IT!I purchased 8 copies of this book for friends and family in the past two months and all have raved about how its changing their lives.swtldyjn"
3,Great Book But Needed Two Copies,Bought it for my daughter-in-law but my wife could not put it down. So I forgot to wrap it up for Christmas. Now I need another copy.
3,authors motives?,"When I first read this book, I was amazed. I thought my life was turning around, all because of the book. It became my new life philosophy. I recommeded it to everyone I knew. After giving it some thought, I proceded to research deeper into the law of attaction. I ended up looking into the many dimisions of the universe and into scientology. I thought about everythign I read. Grabbhorns other books go deeper into scientology. I personaly believe she is very convincing and Excuse me... is the first step in an attempt to lure one into the world of scientology. She is very convincing in her arguments, and she almost brainwashes you into believing this theory. I dont know wheter or not it works, but I believe the author has a hidden motive. Just a thought."
5,I RECOMMEND IT,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me years ago and I have been recommending it to others ever since. Using it along with the workbook is a good idea. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond"
2,A truck drivers version of the laws of the universe,"Although, I personally like the Dr. Phil get down to business approach, but was a little put off by the truck driver version of it. Although the information is good, if you can follow it, it doesn't seem to flow. I think this might be a prelude to some more important info, but prefer the Abraham-Hicks original versions of the information."
4,An entertaining book about the power of feelings,"I read this book a while back and found it to be of great value to me. As other reviewers have pointed out, it perhaps could have benefited from some additional editing, but in my view it's the raw content that's key as opposed to focusing too much on the mechanics of the writing. I really liked Lynn's sense of humor, and her passion for the topic was obvious throughout the book. Was it repetitive in places? Sure, but many books in the personal and personal growth categories are like this. If the message is solid I don't see a problem with hearing it a few times within the context of the work. Because it's both informative and entertaining, in my own book I've included ""Excuse Me..."" as a ""must read"" for anyone on the path of spiritual growth."
2,"Too redundant, but good concept","I think the major problem with the book is that it is over 300 pages long when the author could have condensed the whole concept of the book to about 50 pages or even less. You have to give her a little credit in disguising the many ways she comes up with the central idea: ""focus on what you do want, not on what you don't."" Granted, she gives the reader some examples of how to do that, but come on, 300 pages? I was just itching for something new to bite on well before the 100th page. By the time I finished the book, my brain was numb from the repetition. I haven't put the theory to the test yet, but I will, and I think it could very well work given an open mind and a willingness to see results."
1,This Book Didn't Work For It's Own Author,"That's right. It didn't work for Ms. Grabhorn, and you'll know what I mean if you read her LATEST book, ""Dear God! What's Happening To Us?""Such a shame, because when I first read THIS book, I thought the author was on to something.Little did I know she was just in the ""manic"" phase of her manic-depressive illness."
1,Abraham/Hicks,"Yes, I agree with the review below, Abraham/Hicks material is best for the law of attraction. There are audio recordings of the material that are very inspirational and concise. Abraham/Hicks. Yes."
1,Appalling,"I only hope the author is paying Jerry & Esther Hicks royalties for such a blatant, obvious appropriation of their teachings."
5,READ IT! ... You'll NEVER Regret It!,"... I will joyfully throw you this wonderful little KISS: ""Keep It Simple, Stupid!"" ... READ THIS BOOK! ... ""Just do it!"" ... You will NEVER regret it! Once you start, you will ask yourself: ""WHY have I NOT done these SIMPLE little things BEFORE! "" ... The Answer: Because we've been trapped by our comfortable and familiar ""devils we know!"" ... WHAT was Odysseus's greatest challenge of all? ... Getting away from Calypso!... I know this: Many of us have known many of these underlying concepts all our lives - but few of us actually APPLY them to our lives on a daily basis. Those of us who do are onto something! The application of the attention to SYNCHRONICITY alone will work wonders! ... Reading this book is like getting a blessed, 4th-Way ""Shock"" from Gurdjieff himself! ... I loved it! - The Aeolian Kid (Aeolian_Kid@hotmail.com)"
3,"Good, But Repetitive","This is a good book, it just becomes somewhat repetitive at times. She tends to stress the same points over and over, which is fine for those who need it drilled in their minds. However, I can grasp the concept the first time. So yes, while it is a good book with excellent key points, it can become boring and redundant throughout the middle portion. I also find her writing style to be a little ""off kilter""; then again, I guess it's a refreshing change from the ordinary writing styles you see every day."
5,Do not underestimate the power of feelings.,"Reading the book, I was given new insight into how important feelings are. Basically there are really 3 states of emotions. Excitement, flat-lining (neutral), and negative. I was initially under the impression that as long as you stay away from negative emotions, then you are moving in the right direction. But flat-lining really gets you nowhere. Your aim obviously is to reduce negativity to zero. But try spend more time feeling really excited about your desire (without worrying about when or how to get there), and the magic happens.Thanks for the enlightment!"
3,Generally good book,"I agree with most of her ideas, and she does a good job of explaining energy and how it affects our lives. She is somewhat wordy though, sometimes repeating the same ideas or talking about them longer than necessary. I am still a little confused about implementing some of her ideas, and think I might be able to find them better explained in some other LOA books. I just think it is a little hard for me to accept that feeling is the ONLY way to use the law of attraction. After reading through the whole wordy and long book, I still have a feeling of ""Ok, now what?"" There has to be an easier way to get started.Overall, a good book to help you understand the LOA and energy, but there are other good ones out there."
4,You get what you think about,"I know people just don't want to believe we create our own reality- not just for ourselves but as a mass conciousness. But we do. This book is great for beginners of conscious creation, but for the next stage go to the ""masters"". Seth, through Jane Roberts, teaches deeper levels of this in The Nature of Personal Reality and The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events. Lynn received her inspiration and techniques from Abraham, through Esther Hicks. The books are A New Beginning Parts 1 & 2. The website is www.abraham-hicks.com and it the best source of this information. I just saw Wayne Dyer in Boston and it is clear he is an Abraham/Hicks reader. His workshop will be on PBS in spring of 2004. Guess what, folks? This is becoming clearer every single day. Take your power back and create your life on purpose, connected to the Spirit you really are."
1,Just okay...,"It's not a bad book, however, it is WAY too long for such a simple concept. If you're in need of repetition to understand a concept, then this book is written for you. The concept is good, the writing is less than juvenile. If you took out the cliches, you'd have 150 pages NOT 300+. It will begin to irritate if you catch on quickly."
1,Zero Stars Is More Like It,"This is a total waste of time and money. She takes a couple of simple, incorrect and unsupportable assumptions and just writes repetitive gibberish about them for an entire book. It goes nowhere. It does't work. It's a rip-off for anyone looking for meaningful answers. Don't buy.R McCook"
4,"Good read, arrived quickly.",Book arrived quickly in good shape. Enjoyed reading it and hope to use some of its suggestions!!! Will order from this website again.....
5,Deliberate Creating Made Accessible,"This book is a hidden gem! It provides real-world tools to create a better life.Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting: The Astonishing Power of Feelingsanswers all the vagaries of ""The Secret"" and helps the reader put theory into practice.A must read for anyone looking to improve their state of being!"
3,I'm waiting too....,"I have to agree with both the positive and the negative reviews....- Some really good information is presented and should be considered, b/c there have been studies about energy flow, etc.- Her wording may not jive with me on some levels, but the intention behind the wording has something to work with.- I definitely agree about the editing. The book could have been 1/3 as long, and if she hadn't kept rambling on, maybe all the points would have been presented in a more concise manner, so that it would be easier to follow.- Although there were good points, there was always a way to explain why something didn't work. I think our universe and exsistance has more wonderful randomness than she believes, so I can't swallow her theory completely."
5,She hit the TARGET!,"What a book! This lady has hit the bull's eye with this common sense approach to ""As you think...so shall you be..."" Her humor and abilty to simplfy the subject of feelings is fantastic! Whoa...Whoa...Whoa...Feelings - Lynn Grabhorn understands why it is all about feelings and why we need to wrap our hands and hearts around how everything makes us feel. She hit me right between the eyes as she woke me up on the reasons why my thoughts become my actions. All actions are the results of feelings. Lynn's insight and personal story is powerful and moving! I've purchased several copies for friends and family and I know you will ""FEEL"" better when you read this book!"
5,Spiritual Renewal,"I listened to the CD book version and I loved it! This is an excellent source of mental and spiritual renewal. It reminds me of ""The Secret"" but more personal. It is a source of hope and new beginnings. The author shares her wisdom with the world in hopes we will join her in experiencing joy and peace of mind. I am glad it was drawn into my life."
5,The most empowering book I've ever read!!,"This book does it all. She gives you ideas that maybe you never understood before, she explains by examples, but then takes it a step further and teaches how to implememnt change in your life. I bought 11 copies to give to family and friends, never done that with anything I've ever read before!!"
4,"Feelings, nothing more than feelings. . .","This simple little book has a powerful message: that our feelings determine how successful we will be in life. I don't know how Lynn came up with her breakthrough idea, but it works (if you practice it every day). Since reading this book six weeks ago my life has changed for the better. I now know how to lift myself out of blue moods, how to put a positive spin on setbacks or disappointments, and more important, how to get what I want by Feeling Good. It's so simple -- all you do is learn how to get that feel-good feeling in the pit of your stomach, and you magnify and expand those feelings, and attach them to something you want. You have to be clear about what you want, and Lynn gives some techniques for doing that. This book has given me more practical results than any book on meditation, visualization, or any other popular book on being successful. It's great! jaymack@ix.netcom.com"
5,Good Motivational Fuel,"I am pleased to see that there are now many good reviews coming forth on this book at Amazon.com. When I first starting reading it and had looked at the reviews it was discouraging and I almost regretted my purchase. This morning I finished ""Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting"", and as soon as I did I knew I needed to write a review and share my feelings.I found Lynn's writing style to be animated, enthusiastic, practical, and very much to the point. She presents strategies that you can begin using immediately and they work!Even if you don't agree with every point she makes, I think you will come away with something quite powerful and useful in the end.I was glad I picked up this book and I think you will be too."
5,"Great, Great Book.",The best book. The type of book you definitely read more than once! I find it very helpful. Everyone should read it!
1,Like attracts like?,"Having been through several physics courses and knowing physicists, I felt the author was just pulling her ""physics"" out of thin air. Never have I heard, from any credible physicist, that any of what she said is true. Like attracts like? I've never heard that ""law"" associated with any law of magnetism. Last I heard, opposites attract when dealing with magnetism."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered a used copy of this book and was disappointed when it arrived. It was an earlier edition than the one pictured. Even more disappointing was the amount of writing and underlining in the book. The store advertised the book as something better than ""average"". It was my impression that it would be almost ""like new"". That was definitely not the case. I did email the seller with my thoughts and was refunded the purchase price almost immediately. So, I give a ""5"" for customer service but only a ""2"" for the item itself."
1,"Wrong, wrong, wrong","I burned this book after reading just a few pages. I don't think my wife got breast cancer because she had some negative thoughts and when I got to the section where she wrote ""sin is nothing but a man-made abomination to foster control by others"" I closed the book and said what garbage. She doesn't have a clue about life."
2,Audio version....,"I had begun to read the hard back version, and thought the book made fairly good sense. So I decided to buy the book on tape, because I never seem to have time to read as much as I would like! Ms. Gabhorn has a slight speech impediment which distracted me from her message. The concept, from hearing it in her voice, seemed a little too cheery and shallow. It is not that simple. To see a car (for example) that I want, and to visualize me having it, and then expect to get it is not the reality."
2,Message is good but.....,"I really wanted to like this book, the reviews are so good that I expected good things. Instead I got a book with a message that would have made a great magazine article but was poorly written and repetitive. She blames people for their illnesses and even blames a woman who died due to another's throwing a large rock from an overpass. The deceased wasn't vibrating at a high enough level so she was to blame.The book is poorly written and uses the word ""dude"" way too many times. The author also says, "".....and no I am not retarded"". I found this an unusual turn of phrase for a book about manifesting. I went online to find out more about the author and was shocked at what I found, she started thinking that she was going be made into a light being on another planet so she had assisted suicide. The whole story makes me wish I had not read the book."
2,"Engaging, but... but...","As previous reviewers have noted, author Lynne Grabhorn has a very breezy, enjoyable style. You gotta love someone who names a chapter on human electromagnetic fields ""Look Ma, I'm Vibrating"". I'm more than willing to try her recommendation of visualizing what you want for 15 minutes a day. What have I got to lose?But... but... the thing that holds me back from accepting her whole philosophy about positive/negative vibrations and their results is I keep wondering: ""Do successful people really do this?"" I know people with quite a lot of money and success, and they're just as cranky, fearful and negative as the rest of us. On the whole though, Grabhorn presents very intriguing ideas, and this book has even inspired me to check out the work of her source, Esther Hicks."
2,the secret,"The Secret (Extended Edition)the dvd has some good things to say, but very redundent. was not happy with a previous reommendation to buy this."
2,Good info but she wasn't the first!,Listen this is a good book with great information don't get me wrong! What bothers me to NO END is that the publisher wants us to believe that this author was the first person to bring this information foward! That is a COMPLETE LIE! I find it really irresponsible to try to pass yourself off as the creator of NEW information when you are NOT!
4,Life Changing,Excellent book. Detailed and straight to the point on how to incorporate positive wants and changes into our lives.This book helped me tremendously to bring positive energy into my life. Recommended!
1,Ewww....,"Ok, I absoulutly adore Les Mis. This recording is an insult to the story, the music, and most of all, the show in general. I DO NOT suggest this to ANYONE. No offence to community theatres, but it sounds like the Somewhere Playhouse decided to put on Les Mis. I really think that if you want a sample of the show, get the Original Broadway cast, the Original London cast, the Compleat Symphonic recording, the 10th Anniversary recording, or one of the French recordings. Better yet, see it live! Just don't base your oppinion of this amazing musical on this less that horrid recording of it."
1,"Subpar vocalist, lots of fluff","Ms Leonhart is definitely not on par with the likes of Diana Krall, Jane Monheit, Diane Schur, Cassandra Wilson, or any of today's top female jazz vocalists. Her voice is tiny, saccharine, forced. Sounds like someone had the funds to help her release 2 albums, but skip them, not worth the money. She's a typical house band singer for a mediocre lounge."
4,Find What God Is Doing and Join Him,"This book picks up the study of the life of Abraham, with the goal of applying that life to someone in the current time period. As Blackaby is very familiar with his own life, he draws a lot of parallels.What you'll find with this book is that it will challenge you. It will challenge you to look at the life of Abraham--from where he was when God called him to where he ended up--a man that could be called a friend of God.And that truly is the point of the book--to help the believer today gain from the life of Abraham what it takes to be faithful to God, to see Him work in the area around you and to join Him in that work.I highly recommend this book, as well asExperiencing God: Knowing and Doing the Will of Godif you want a more challenging version which has you go through the study over a 12 week period."
2,Disrespectful to Catholics,"I was appalled to read on page 49 that ""a girl with a Catholic background was saved in our church."" I was always taught to respect others in their religious beliefs, and that you do not have to belong to a particular religion to be SAVED.I really cannot understand how a man of God can write in this manner."
5,love dave and sugar,The best album that dave and sugar did. A must have I Love this album. I would recommend it to all Dave and sugar fans.
4,Dave & Sugar,"Hard to find this CD. Enjoy most of their music, expecially the Sugar vocals. I agree with one of the other reviewers that their sound is a bit like a country version of ABBA."
3,"Updating of ""Arthur""","Essentially a rewrite of ""Arthur."" Includes some themes and events that Lawhead did did include previously"
3,Starting to show some wear around the edges.,"I would actually give it a 3.5 or 3.75 out of 5.The franchise is starting to show some strain. Mr. Lawhead stresses that he is basing his retelling on materials earlier and less muddied than other versions but I could not escape the feeling that some twists and skewed events were written in that way just to be twisty and skewed. In other words, I was not so immersed in the world that I could leave behind the more familiar legends. I enjoyed it but will not be going on to the next books in the series."
4,Gong - 'I Am Your Egg' (Voiceprint),"More or less, pretty much your typical Gong effort - by that (of course) I mean it to be a good thing. I've had a few patrons ask me about this CD import - since it obviously isn't a 'main' release. Tunes that I dug the most were ""End St. Station"" (featuring some of Gilli Smyth's outstanding space whispers), the poetic gem {sort to speak} ""Melting Love"", the laid back seven-minute open-jam ""River Song"", the tripping ""Midnight Sun"" and the airy modern-day Gong classic ""Memory"". On the back cover, there are like twenty musicians listed, here are some of the familiar names (to me): Daevid & Orlando Allen, Gilli Smyth, Josh Pollock, Harry Williamson, Steve Holt and Kawabata Makoto - you get the point. Recommended."
3,Grand Music,"This CD was recommended by a corsigan fellow who makes cookies in Kansas City, but sometimes has a keen ear for music. He said that this band sounded like ARS and Ambrosia. And those are two great challenges for the ear. Also this band, he states, was not recommended by Farteaga, that was his sole discovery. This is a japanese import well recorded. Enjoy!"
2,Okay,I enjoyed this book but it was a little slow read for me. I only read it when I didnt have anything else better to read. It was satisfying with memorable characters. not too bad
3,OK,I wasn't real crazy about most of the patterns. There were a few that did give me other ideas. The styles just weren't for me.
5,Excellent Sport travel,"I purchased this rolling duffel specifically for scuba dive travel. It holds it's shape well and I can put my dive gear in the bottom while my clothes stay on top. I found that when traveling on vacation, I could unzip the divider and fit more clothes than my large suitcase. So it has given me double duty. Massively rugged and durable."
1,Good design - NOT touch enough,"Bought this bag to transport my fly rods etc. Great design...but after just 7 total flying legs (3.5 trips). It is done. Five rips, broken zipper. I got rips on every flight and patched them but this final trip has killed it. Now I am looking for a replacement before I try the trip home. Really disappointed. The fabric just is not touch enough."
4,Decent bag,"I bought this bag because it was one of the few rolling duffles I could find with backpack straps. I borrowed a friend's for a trip to Europe (another brand) and it was really convenient to be able to put my big bag on my back when needed. This one is skinnier than I was expecting, but should still do the trick and maybe help limit my overpacking?"
1,Not what I thought,"For the price, this was a low quality bag. The first time I used it,I had to take things out at the airport to place in another bag, and the zipper broke. Very disappointed in this bag."
1,One star because I can't give cero star!,"I ordered this product very excited about it and here the following:shipping: great, very fast.item: incredibly in bad shape: wheel rod dented and bended; the inside plastic cover of the bag with tiny holes and white powder; outside close to the border of the zipper tiny holes too. Spots in the outside fabric.Like totally used item.I sent to the seller couple of emails which were answered. Seller insisted in exchange, I just wanted a refund because there was no time available for me to wait for another item since I was traveling a week after. I sent the product back to the company,I haven't heard from them (seller) neither receive the refund. Still waiting and hoping for my refund."
1,Fell apart on first use,"This is of poor quality. It was purchased for a trip to Australia. I did not over pack it, but 2 of the 4 zippers broke during this trip! One of the end pockets is completely unusable due to the broken zipper. The other broken one is on one of the main pockets and is barely held together. How this bag made it home, I will never know. My husband purchased a similar bag from Eddie Bauer for himself and that bag is still in perfect condition after our trip. This bag? Looks like it's 20 years old and is barely hanging together. Do not waste your money on this product, it's not worth it."
1,I tried to give negative stars for this review.,"I tried two recipes in this book, Creamy Chocolate Mousse. p 96 and Butterscotch-Chocolate Fudge, p 24.The mousse is the worst thing to ever have passed my lips. I don't know why all those ingredients were wasted in this recipe; because the only thing I tasted was the cream cheese and the instant coffee. It is reprehensible that one could taste this concoction and still place in a recipe book to make others ill.The ""fudge"" is anything but. It never attains the consistency of fudge, turning instead, to a gellatenous mess that can't even be washed down the drain. It must be thrown in the garbage - OUTSIDE - so that it does not stink up the house.I think Ms. Finsand, and all those who contributed to this book should be required to spend the rest of their lives eating nothing but the recipes in this book. She should at least taste every recipe in the book before publishing it."
4,God In You,"""God In You"" by David Jeremiah looks at the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer.The topics covered include:1. The beliver's everyday dependence on the Holy Spirit.2. The Holy Spirit is a Person, not a thing or impersonal force.3. How the Holy Spirit's power works in and through the believer.4. The Holy Spirit equips us to serve one another.5. The Holy Spirit's role in our family, church, work, and other areas of our lives.The title is a good read (around 250 pages) and may be read in a few sittings. The narrative is easy to understand and follow.Whatever your opinion of Dr. Jeremiah, the book is informative and will challenge your assumptions of the Holy Spirit.Recommended."
5,"Biblically based, lucid in style, and skillfully applied.","As written in Moody Magazine, May/June 1999: David Jeremiah, a seasoned pastor and skilled theologian, writes (and preaches) theology the way it should always be done - Biblically based, lucid in style, and skillfully applied. This sort of communication is especially important in the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, where much misunderstanding and excess have clouded a teaching that is crucial to the spiritual health of individual Christians and the Church. Though Jeremiah writes with cleear conviction, his approach is irenic without compromise. His teaching is ordered and systematic without being pedantic. Fitting illustrations abound, and real-life situations bring a warmth that draws the reader in and along. One can clearly sense the heart of a true shepherd who is determined to guide, nurture, and protect the flock of God, in the appropriation of God's power for everyday living in both it's highs and lows. H.F."
1,So sad,"How sad to live your life believing God is fully able to do miracles in your life then he simply deems that you don't need them. Imagine a God who so loveless that his only reason for miracles is to validate himself. Once he feels validated he withholds from his children the promises he made to them, for the next 2,000 years. If you want to be depressed, read this book. If you need a miracle, go to a Charismatic church."
1,designer,More about Peggy than Rudi.Some nice photos but disappointing if you bought this book to learn about the artist himself.Very self- appeciating about the author.ugh.
4,Very poignant story of famial love,"While browsing thru notes I made on books read years and years ago, I came across my remarks about Angel Landing, another Hoffman book, and remembered how impressed I was with her writing style and characters. I decided to see if she had written any more books and had no idea she had written so many others, including one selected by Oprah's reading group. I was not disappointed to be reading her again. Her characters, always quirky and strange, are written in such a lyrical tone that they seem very real and human. In The Drowining Season, Esther the White is the matriarch of a very dysfunctional yet loving family. Hoffman slowly reveals the past deceptions and future dreams of all the family members culminating in life-changing decisions made by all three generations. Your only hope is that all will have found the peace and love so desired. A great read!"
4,"Quite The Strange, Dysfunctional Family","Alice Hoffman gives us a tale here in which the reader needs to pay attention to fully appreciate.It begins with family elders emigrating from Europe & brings us to 20th Century Long Island. The dysfunction starts from the get-go.It's quite an interesting story of the darker side of the human psyche. Almost all the seven deadly sins take place among the book's self-serving familial characters. Almost everyone who reads this can probably identify with one or more of the characters.In a family in which there appears no redeeming qualities among both young & old; there eventually forms a strange bond between the two main characters. Both named Esther.Supposedly taking place on LI (Where I'm from) any reference to Long Island seems contrived & there really is no basis of reference geographically.It's an oldie. But, if you haven't read it give it a shot. If you pay attention to the interaction among the very strong characters, the book is quite good"
3,A fan of Alice Hoffman,"This the third book I have read by Alice Hoffman and while I liked it, I didn't think it was as good as the other two (Here on Earth and The Dovekeepers).The characters are a little strange but it was interesting to read."
2,very disappointing,"Since 2 of the main characters were named Esther the White and Esther the Black, I thought if I had to read their name one more time I would go crazy. It was a rambling story."
5,I love Alice Hoffman,This book is another of my favorites from Alice Hoffman. A quick read that contains insights into the human condition.
2,The Drowning Season,It just didn't appeal to me. I was never captured by story or characters but I stayed with it till the end.
5,A Sweet Story of Generations,This is an excellent collected telling of four generations of a family written in the author's beautiful prose. Love it.
4,"good, hard to remove and put on","These shoes are perfect for camp. They clean easily and dry quickly. My son has gotten them a bit muddy though, and you have to make an effort to get the muck out from inside the toe, or his toes are totally disgusting at the end of the day. He can abuse them as much as he likes though, and they still look good. He likes them a lot, very comfortable"
2,the phone was unusable and was not new,"I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger. In addition, I was unable to activate it with my carrier due to there being no acceptable number on the phone under the battery. I give it a one star for prompt delivery, but even that did me no good."
2,Hammered,"Rather than this being a comprehensive biography of the man this book is a clumsy hatchet job which is a shame. I am not saying I am a big fan of Delay. I am not. There is enough about Tom Delay to causes one to raise eyebrows. But rather than the authors doing an extensive investigation their zeal to either ""have at"" Delay or rush their book to print leaves us with a disjointed picture of the man. It is important for us to know the full truth about Delay both good and bad and even though the book is an attack against Delay even the negatives this book reveals are inadequately expressed and incomplete.I look forward to a books by other authors, either from the right or the left, that have a much more academic approach.As Delay seems to be the latest victim of the bloodsport which is politics and may well fade into obscurity we may never know the complete facts thanks to a book like this."
4,Interesting!,This book was okay. It had great info. It's a great book to learn about the corupt tactics Tom DeLay and the GOP (Greed and Oil Party). If you'r a Molly Ivans fan you will love this book!
2,Awful writing,"Although Ms. French adds a unique volume to the ever-growing body of eating disorder literature, her writing, unfortunately, makes it unreadable. Having said that, I must admit that I did not finish the book, but only because it was unbearable to read. It may very well be a powerful andpoignant fable, but the writing itself is tedious and uncompelling."
3,not for the out of stater,"I'm probably spoiled by the AMC guides for New England, but I found this book to be somewhat uninvting and lacking in some key areas. The maps weren't all that great they clearly aren't for a guy from the north east who's trying to find his way through the red dirt maze that is North Georgia. Directions to the trailheads could be markedly improved, as some (particularly the ones I used) use forest service roads that park rangers (let alone easily purchased maps) don't know well.The copy and descriptions are good once I got to the trailhead, and organized linearly along the trail. I really enjoyed the plots of trail elevation over distance."
4,"Map in one hand, book in other, we got there & back.","We found the book very good at helping us plan day hikes on or near the AT. Some difficulty cross referencing roads, highways, and the forest roads."
2,Find another book!,"This book is not worth a read. I had to read for a religious studies class and it is probably one of the most poorly written books that I have read. Her thesis basically had nothing to do with the rest of the book. It is very easy to speed read here and in this case, that is not a good thing."
3,Inspiring reading.,A very inspiring and reminding book for people writing scientific papers.All the figures and citats makes it so funny to read. You don't have to be in the department of agronomy to get a good idea for your paper from this book. After reading I just longed for continuing my writing field with new ideas and it's frontpage is so coulorful so for me it's not only a book but also a piece of art.
5,Excellent,"Volume II of Opera Obession is as good as Volume I, which is to say, very good indeed. The price may be bargain basement, but the quality is not, and this is another wonderful selection of outstanding opera singers. There are few liner notes to speak of (no years of the performances), but this is a very minor flaw in an album of great value."
2,For Type A personalities with no love for story telling,"This book is a textbook and it feels like one from beginning to end. ""Pedantic"" is a gross understatement. The exercises are useful but I think a budding writer might find this program more harmful than helpful, in it's desire to make sure you're always following his rules. In the end his approach might get you some ideas.. but not before it sucks all the fun out of the creative process.If, on the other hand, you are a type A personality who really wants a rigid set of rules so you can feel secure in tackling something creative, maybe this will work for you. But my impression is that the aim of the book is to make storytelling so complicated and boring that he wants you to give up writing by the time you finish reading it. I'm a writer who buys all these books as way of refreshing my process and finding new inspiration. ""Inspiring"" this book is not."
5,Gift for my son.,This was a gift for my son. He just graduated from film school and it was on his list of 'books I must read'! He said it is great!
5,"Wynberg plays, with various other artists ,and is astounding",The 10 string guitar adds depth and Wynberg shares his talent and roots. He is amazing! Awesome!! This is a MUST HAVE!!
1,Cheaply made and no stand.,I wonder if this version is fake. Seems cheaply made and comes with no stand. what where they thinking about when they made this version of the greatest GI Joe character ever? Snake Eyes deserves more than this.
4,"It really is""Different For Girls""","As a Transgender woman myself I found the movie ""Different For Girls""to be touching and fairytale like in that Karl now kim gets to interact with her school protector and friend Prentice in the form of the person she always felt she was but was unable to convey physically in school now that she has transitioned into a woman.The only negative thing I have to say is that they could have used a real transgender woman or at least an actor that looked and sounded more like a woman.I enjoyed the movie very much but I could see so much man in the actor that played Kim and that distracted me.anyway it's still a wonderful story that brings up issues of tolerance,ignorance and unconditional love.Plus Rupert Graves who portrays Prentice is so sexy."
5,One word...WISDOM,Napolean Hill has really done it with this one! I read it for the first time about six months ago and immediately loved it. Since this book was written towards the end of Hill's career (and life) you can hear the wisdom coming through the words. It is a book to be kept close and cherished on your path to greatness. Enjoy!
5,Pragmatic,"In short, this a good read for anyone that needs an uplifting attitude adjustment. The book may seem a little dated but its message is timeless."
2,bizarre,"I read Hills's Think and Grow Rich, and immediately after, this book some years ago. I wanted to see what all the talk was about. Can one really find success in a book? Well, no, one really can't, that's not how success works. But with Think and Grow Rich with Peace of Mind I did learn something about Hill the man, the giver of all financial wisdom, and it was this: I imagine that this part has been extirpated from the latest editions, but at the end of the book I read, Napoleon Hill reveals the source of his remarkable wisdom. Wise men, teletransported from Tibet. I'm not making this up.Hill was a fraud and a con man. You won't grow rich (perhaps fat, but never rich) from sitting around and reading his tripe anymore than you will from reading a bus schedule. But Americans are an optimistic, hopeful people and I'm more than a little bit certain that Hill's books will be best-sellers long after I'm gone.Richard VidaurriGuadalajara, Mexico"
5,Classic and Valuable Read,"Napoleon Hill is the recognized expert on all things success. In this book, Hill reveals how you can grow rich, and keep your mental act together at the same time. Typical of Hill's writing style, the book is easy to read, and features numerous examples from his real life experience. Specifically, this book covers, among many other things:Success while being yourself.Developing a healthy ego.Finding friendship and love.Getting the job you want.Turning challenges into success.This book focuses on achieving success through positive relationships and a healthy mental attitude. For more information on achieving financial success, you may want to read ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
5,The No-SAlt Lowest-Sodium BAking Book.,I have enjoyed using this book and will use it to help my husband with his kidney disease. I am stressed with the mistakes in the recipes and have written to the author's web site for clarification.
3,The No-Salt Lowest Sodium Cookbook,"Many, many recipes to choose from. Good tips and each recipe has nutritional information listed in addition to the sodium content. Just have not hit on any good tasting recipe yet....perhaps I just have not picked the right ones yet."
5,Timeless Melodies,"Huayucaltia (which means unity in Spanish) is a band that I have followed for over two decades. This CD, which is a compilation of their best performances, really shows the band's seasoned musicality. Their tunes are forceful, yet the gentle Peruvian flute shines like a bright sun to lift the mood. My favorite piece is Caminos Y Puentes. You don't have to speak Spanish to love it, it has a dance rythm that is so uplifting. Ciro Hurtado is perfection in Candombe Para Amancay. He really plays his guitar as if he is riding a horse he has learned to tame over the years. This band gets better with each album...Bravo y Encore!"
5,Model 22 Type 1 Little Giant Ladder 10303,"Very nice ladder system. built very heavy duty. At 245# myself, ladder doesn't budge. My [...] son has been watching the info commercials for years...lets get one, lets get one. Actually bought (2) this one and a sky scraper, this one is his. It's very easy to handle and set up. The only difference is the other ladder is heavier and a bit ackward: do to weight and being taller. Fold up for easy storage, superior strength, good price. the strength of these ladders is worth every penny they cost."
3,Works most of the time,"I bought this item to use with my Treo 650. I have to carry my phone with me or I get a lot of static from room to room. Every time I turn the ear piece off or charge it, I have to reconfigure it to work with my phone again. When I wear it the sound quality is very good and people can hear me very well with no interference, which is better than the device I bought from Treo, which no one could hear me on."
