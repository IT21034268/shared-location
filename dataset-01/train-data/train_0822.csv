2,Hmmmm,"Two things with this album. I seem to have 'grown out' of it. I think it's a summertime record, if anything, but now it's all cold and raining I just can't be bothered with it, frankly.The second thing: I didn't realise they's change the cover for a US release! Although, I suppose the UK version of the album cover, with it's _incredibly_ obese, and obviously American, bloke with his 'I'm #1 So Why Try Harder?' T-shirt probably wouldn't have gone down very well in the US. Still, got to laugh, haven't you."
1,The whole thing sucks,"The whole thing sucks, dont' waste your money, usually i'm open to any kind of music, as long as it's good it's cool, but this is horrible, the song ""praise you"" well is ok, i never saw anything great in it, the song its self is ok, for the first couple days, then it sucks ***k, and then the rest of the album is boring, and is full of swars, man it really took a genius to think up this album...i'm very disappontied"
1,ARGH!,"The masses really seem to have embraced Mr. Slim, and it makes perfect sense--he's lousy. He is repetitious beyond belief, to the point of madness. Of course he is ruining what is known as 'big beat' (another idiotic sub-sub-genre) but this is to be expected. This is simply mass produced beats that anyone with the same equipment could squeeze out. For all their faults, I'll take the Chem Brothers, who at least seem to have a better record collection. And folks: ENOUGH WITH THE VINYL RECORD STATIC POPS AND TICKS PLEASE. It is getting very, very, very OLD."
4,Good Album,"The first track on the album ""Right Here, Right Now"" shows you Cook's genius. From that track on, he never stops laying down the grooves. He is a genius, and possibly the most recognized Electronica musician in the world. He continues to bring attention to the genre, and soon it will become mainstream and everyone will like it. Although many other great artists are in this genre, they will probably never be heard of, but Cook may bring this genre out of the dark."
4,Fatboy Slim is an excellant DJ,"Fatboy Slim is doing what he wants to do, and thats what counts. His new album shows an incredible amount of excellence. He's always on the beat, always on point. Samples used are one of a kind, and very interesting. As a DJ myself, i understand how it feels to do something right on turntables, or with samplers, and as far as i can hear, Fatboy Slim has alot to be proud of. I simply can't wait for the next Fatboy Slim album to be released!"
5,TOTALLY awesome!!!!!!!,What a great CD!!!!!!! Fatboy Slim provide the most fun dance songs ever!!!! This is a must-buy for any electronica/dance music fan.
3,Not hardcore.,"FBS big beat is nothing like Prodigy or CB--the Amazon guy's description of ""bubble-gum techno"" is perfect. Almost everything about this CD is pop-oriented; the songs are all pretty much based on the same structure. Yes, the beats are hard but the formula is repetitive and obvious. I do have to say that FBS does it very well; this is a completely fantastic record to drive to. It's hard and light at once. However, you don't want to listen through it more than once at a time; after the first listen the songs tend to get a little sickening."
3,"Good, but not completely recconmended",It was really good for a few weeks but got boring after a while
5,Buy this CD!,"This CD is so awesome it's not even funny. An apprication for Fatboy Slim is required! I can't get enough of ""The Rockafeller Skank"" but I've had enough of ""Praise You"". 5 STARS, because it's Fatboy Slim and he just made a CD I can go crazy to."
3,An Anthem of Our Days,"I had always thought that Norman Cook's music was just crowd pleasing guff - something with a little more bite after the aural eternity of Backstreet Boys and Celine Dion.Then I heard Right Here, Right Now.While the other songs on this album are catchy, none of them can really stir the blood like this stunningly mesmerising ""Get The Hell Up and Live"" track. I have the unfortunate feeling that, like Blur's Song 2 and the Verve's Bittersweet Symphony, this is going to be played on every radio and advertising campaign you can think of. Listen to it now, and be thankful."
5,Great CD... good rythem... Master of DJ's,"After owning this cd exactly a year, and having memorized every song front to back I have to say I am in love with it. This cd has the best rhythms and effects any techno cd could have. If you really like dance music and those really moving rhythms, but don't go for the hard beat and really repetitive chemical brothers type techno... then this is perfect for you... a true masterpiece. I highly recommend this cd over all other techno cd's. Every pennies worth. Hope to see more cd's as perfect as this one. (maybe another from fatboy him self).If you like his cd, check out his remixes too... they are also great."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I found this album disappointing to say the least. I really liked ""Rockafeller Skank"" when I heard it on the radio, but the longer album version tends to get on my nerves a bit. Some of the other tracks are equally annoying. ""Illin in Heaven"" for example, is barely music, and seemed to be just an excuse to have an ""explicit lyrics"" sticker on the cover. ""Gangster Trippin"" and ""Praise You"" are good tracks, but they can be found on the ""Go"" and ""Cruel Intentions"" soundtracks, both of which are much better CDs to buy. I wanted to like this CD, but was strongly disappointed."
1,Don't be fooled by the MTV.,"The video is great, the rythm is great. No doubt, ""Praise You"" is a wonderful song. It was wonderful enough to make me check out the album. However, I sold it the next day. After listening to all the songs, I discovered that the entire cd only contained four different words, one of them being the ""f word"" which, in the song ""In Heaven"" is repeated constantly for upwards of 60 times. Creativity? I see none. ""Praise You"" is a catchy song, but the album itsself is anything but catchy. Don't waste your money like I did. Instead, if you're into good pop music--check out Cher's new release or the new one by REM. If you want other better alternitives to this album that don't involve music, try beating your head on hot rocks. Better still--stab yourself in the chest repeatedly and go for a dip in your psycho neighbor's alcohol spa."
3,I can't dance anymore..,This is a good album to listen too if your're going on a long drive about 2 - 3 hour trip. Doesn't have alot of dance tunes if your into some form of syncopation which techno unfortunately doesn't have or is hard to get used to.
2,Fatboy needs to slim down the running time....,"In Heaven is a terrible track, period. There are some solid tracks, but the album is weighed down by too much repetition. After listening to about 2 minutes of a track like Gangster Trippin' I'm ready for the next track. Trim the fat and you might have something. Give this one a pass, or just get the decent tracks (Rockafeller Skank, Praise You)."
3,Everywhere Everywhere...is Fatboy Slim,"The breakthrough album and zeneth of Fatboy Slim's Career. Tracks that integrated within all that was pop culture during the late 90's. From Adidas advertisements to the opening credits of clubber's cult classic, Human Traffic. Fatboy Slim was it...for a short but sweet time that rounded off the 20th century. He blew the sand off of Brighton Beach, and turned down Madonna when she asked him to collaborate on an album with her. Nice.Some tracks are annoying, but I still have three or four tracks that I listen to fairly regularly. If for some bizarre reason, you don't have this album already, it is a worthy addition if you can find it cheap. I have the import as the US had to co-release an edited version (Clean...as Amazon likes to put it) before we were permitted to be exposed to Fatboy's dirty mouth. You would not be missing anything special by picking up the 11 track US release. Whether you want your version to be ""clean"" or not is up to you.3/5 stars."
4,Nice blading music,"I'm not really a Fatboy Slim fan, but I've found that this album is wonderful when I go 'blading down my local bike trail. It had just the right speed and tempo to keep me moving. Try excercising to it yourself and see what you think."
3,Great in the beginning.......but,"With the consistency of this Electronica moguls library i keep finding the same things songs stick out i like them then like them alot then within a week i cant listen to it I get bored with a Norman Cook/Fatboy Slim album quite fast, but dont get me wrong, the stuff on it is put together in extraordinary manner but i think ill just stick with Seb, PVD and Digweed"
1,very weak,this group is way overrated.one beat and the same song over&over again.if you put beck into the group could you tell the difference? it's mindless weak boring music.
2,Hasn't come a long way,"This is just more bland mainstream electronica from FS. If you like Prodigy, Chem Bros. and Crystal Meth. you'll probably like this too. But if you like actual artists like Aphex Twin and Amon Tobin, you'll be very bored with this indeed."
1,Junk,"I find mainstream techno listenable on a certain level (but prefer others: Juno Reactor, Massive Attack, DJ Spooky), and I own Fatboy's first release and like to listen to it, but this is trash. An NFL halftime show has more adventuresome songcraft than this. Good grief, utter trash."
4,aa,"i dont hav this album, i only heard the rockafeller skank song and its pretty cool. i like that lord finesse sample"
1,THIS IS BAD,"THIS IS HORRIBLE ALL HE DOES IS SAY THE SAME DUMB THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK,..."
2,Good in slim doses,"Fat Boy Slim's album You've Come A Long Way, Baby came alongway because of advertising. Advertisers were desperate for a catchyhit that they could use to sell their product and Fat Boy Slim's albumhad a compilation of such tracks.'Praise You', 'Right here, rightnow', 'The Rockafeller Skank' were all played religiously throughoutthe year of their release. Fat Boy Slim was a cultural phenomenon.However nothing lasts in our fast-food culture and so, an album likeMoby's Play came along and took over the mantle of the new advertisingweapon.So now, You've come a long way baby doesn't hold up as well.Sure, the hits at the time still have novelty value but the albumitself doesn't allow repeated listens. There's too much repetition inthe tracks already. ... It's awful! There was a fad for that type ofdance music a few years ago and Fat Boy Slim produced the best stuff.But this stuff just doesn't compare to a good old-fashioned sing-alongalbum."
2,Previous Fatboy?,"This CD is really only for those with previous Fatboy experience. Those who know they like it. I know many people who listened to Rockafeller Skank, liked it, bought the album and then only liked one song. If you aren't sure that you like Slim's style, then you're better off borrowing this one."
2,60 Seconds is Just About Right,"It's no surprise that so many of the tracks on this disc are also featured in commercials: they're infectious, bouncy, interesting and fun -- for 30 or 60 seconds depending on your attention span. I tried listening to the whole disc in order in the car without jumping forward or backward during the songs. Couldn't do it. It's like having the television remote in my hand on a Thursday night at 3 a.m., there's just nothing to get into for more than a few minutes. There are moments of excellence as Rockfella Skank and Praise You prove. Still, it's like listening to Beck without the creativity. Think I'll stick with the Housemartins. That's my idea of a happy hour -- again."
2,"Catchy, very repetitive mainstream house music","Although Norman Cook's talent is evident in tracks like Right Here Right Now, most of the rest is mostly unoriginal and very repetitive bigbeat tracks. Tracks like 'Praise You' are some of the most annoying, unintelligent, REPETITIVE tripe ever played on record. Try more original, funky groups like basement Jaxx, Daft punk, et al."
4,Artistic; The music is Norman Cook's canvas,"It's seldom been found a band quite like this. The songs are like nothing I've ever heard before. It's like a surrealistic painting coverted to sound. Nonetheless, most of the songs are great. There is one that is absolutely idle and in short, sucks. That song is track number 3. Never have I heard such monstrosity. I don't usually mind the use of profane language, but a song that repeats ""Fatboy Slim is..."" (you know the rest) goes down absolute crap and a complete mockery in my book. That one song lowered the rating of this review by one star. I'm not offended by many things, but this crosses the line...So people easily offended or people with Christian beliefs, if you buy this album, stay away from track 3. Nuff said."
4,pretty good,"I bought this album with very high expectations and it lived up to most of them. However, my one complaint.....which is mostly my fault....is that it is pretty much bubblegum pop music. It makes me want to dance but you really can't read too much into it. My big problem was that I bought it after discovering Orbital's Insides, and the two just don't compare. So, if you like what you hear, and you are satisfied with that, then this is definately a good buy for you. However, if you are expecting deep and moving music that grows with each listening, I would suggest Orbital or somebdy else. I know i have done a lot of whining here, but to counteract that, I'd like to stress how FUN this album is....and that really is its purpose I believe."
4,"rock, rock, rock my boat - gently rock my boat","I was unable to walk until I heard this cd. When it played, I rose up out of my wheelchair and did the dirty boogie all night long. I am so grateful to Fatboy Slim."
2,Wish I could get my money back,"This is a pretty bad cd, I am still very dissapointed at having been stupid enough to buy it. A few friends recommended it, we all pretty much have the same taste in music, but on this one they missed by a mile. Don't waste your money. Get Prodigy, Crystal Method, Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk. Now there goes some real talent."
2,Bad language!!,"I love their hit single, ""Praise You"" but the rest of this cd is a bunch of noises and bad language. They say stuff ""they are doing in Heaven"" I would never say!! Bad, bad bad language!!"
5,Great time beats from the fat one,"Slim hits the big time with this stormin' album, packed with punch and andrenaline. Many great airings at parties across the country await this masterpiece of electronic dance music. With the amount of money this one will rake in, he'll be able to afford to eat all the pies!"
4,solid follow up for fatboy slim,"Great beats and some very memorable songs. I just wished that ""in heaven"" was not one that I had to skip due to lack of redeeming value. Praise you is a great song, but has scratches that should have been taken care of. All other songs are fun and energetic, and this will remain on my playlist for a long time."
3,The songs are better than just the the pure dance grooves,"I am a rock fan and do not care for dance music.The songs on here that more resemble conventional song structure, with lyrics, are what ""float my boat"" as opposed to the more synthasized, groove oriented tracks.""Rockefeller Skank"" and ""Praise you"" are the clear highlights"
1,I wish I could give a negative number,Are you people on drugs! You do realize that Rockafeller Skank consists of about 6 unintelligible words repeated over and over for more than 8 minutes don't you? How can you consider that great music? I think it should be used as a torture device to get enemies to spill their guts.
5,good book,"I read this book as a kid and I still enjoy it. The story follows a young boy who finds himself separated from his mother and alone in London. He ends up working for Holmes when he meets the sister of Wiggins, one of Holmes's Baker Street Irregulars. The mystery solved is a good one and the characters are interesting. Holmes and Watson are in character as well. It's a good book for kids who like Sherlock Holmes or mysteries. It's also just a flat-out good Holmes story for anyone who enjoys following the exploits of the detective, despite the fact that it was written for children."
4,Not the whole soundtrack,"WHY IS ""EDERLEZI AVELA"" NOT ON THIS SOUNDTRACK? That was one of the most important parts of the movie and they didn't even include the two versions from the film(the first from when Perhan is leaving his village, and the second when he returns.)!!!This is definately worth having, but for diehard fans of the film like me, there is a lot missing. Also missing ""Save ratke daje me pirava"" instrumental from the wedding scene."
5,Mezmorizing... haunting.... unforgettable...,I saw this movie in France about 10 years ago & the soundtrack has haunted me ever since. This is an incredible soundtrack to a truly gifted film by a sensational musical talent.
3,Very disapointing microwave heat pad,I purchased this product hoping it would be as good as the Therabead pad I was retiring. It's not. It doesn't get nearly as hot or last as long. My Therabead pad would hold significant heat for about 30 minutes and moderate heat for another 10 or so. I only get about 15 minutes of moderate heat from the Thermalon bag. I tried heating it longer than instructed eventhough the instructions advise against it. That might have given me an extra 5 minutes. I will likely purchase the Therabead to use in the future.
5,Pain relief !,I love to use this on my arthritic hands. It feels so warm and makes the pain go away and lets me feel almost normal in just a few minutes.I would recommend this to everyone who has pain.
5,Great product!,"I bought this for my wife, who gets cold on winter Chicago nights. The product performs exactly as advertised, suppling a great source of moist comforting heat after ony a few minutes in the Microwave. Highly recommended!"
2,Doesn't hold the head,"Hi FolksOthers may have liked this pad, but compared to the one my sister in-law sent me from Australia, it isn't very good. It holds the heat about 1/4 of the time the Oz pad does. Now to find out where the sister got it from and start selling them in the USA!Cheers"
5,You will love it.,"Bought it for my mom as a gift not only for her back but she has TMJ. She swears sometimes a nice heat pad helps but could never find a ""nice cushy flat one"". Well, She's tested thoroughly and says she approves!"
2,takes too long to heat up,The thermalon heat pad takes too long ( three minutes ) to heat up and then cools down too quickly
5,Works like MAGIC!,I use this in addition to Thermalon back wrap. Easy to use and works great. Really helps to work the knots out.
4,Thermalon Microwave Heat Relief,I actually bought two so I could keep one at work because it was so helpful for my lower back. It was rather dusty though so I made covers.I would buy again.
4,Good Product,"This pad works very well. It seems like it doesn't hold the heat as longas it should, but it just may be that I'm so used to heating, that thetemperature needs to stay pretty intense. Otherwise, good quality and easyto use."
2,NOT DURABLE ENOUGH FOR MICROWAVE,"EVEN WHEN MICROWAVING AS PER INSTRUCTIONS, THE HEAT PACK EVENTUALLY SPLIT OPEN, SPILLING ITS CONTENTS. HAVING USED OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT PERFORMED WELL, I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST BUYING THIS PARTICULAR ITEM."
2,be very careful,"Be very careful while heating this in the microwave. I bought this for my Mom for Christmas and she has already had to sew several spots that ""burned"" holes while being heated up. It says to make sure no bends or creases while heating, but even just a little will cause burns in the fabric."
1,Terrible!!!,I had to return this product. It leaked after about 4 or 5 uses. Don't waste your time and effort.
1,Terrible...,"I'm an experienced programmer, and I was trying to use this book to refresh my memory of simple VB features. Frustrated at how terrible this book is, I decided to write this review so no one else falls into the same trap. Sure a few of the examples are nice, but they are only listed verbatim, without any explanation of the implications or reasons of what the code is doing. It tells you how to do something, but not why you are doing it. The index is also terrible, with no entries for common VB controls and programming constructs. If you absolutely have to use this book, use it for the examples, not to learn any real VB programming."
2,Don't waste your money,"Impossible to follow! Bad examples! Incomplete! Touched on a thousand different topics and didn't explain any of them well enough to be able to do them unless you already have extensive experience. The catch is.... If you already have extensive experience, you shouldn't buy this book anyway as it would be a waste of your time."
4,"Insightful, but incomplete","I can't add much to the more comprehensive reviews already posted, but I did enjoy this book. It is quite interested to read the intricate dealings of the CIA with various foreign leaders.Of course, like others have said, this book is just a series of highlights. Shackley has a fairly dubious reputation, and this book leaves out a lot of Shackley's career. A lot of criticism can be given for that and some parts have to be taken with a grain of salt, knowing that Shackley isn't going to condemn himself for anything he did.That being said, this book was worth reading, but I wouldn't consider it an ""entry-level"" read. It can be dry at times and not always a page-turner. But for those familiar with Shackley and aspects of his career, this will be a worthwhile read."
5,Superb composition and performance,Dreaming of Summer and Songs of the Spirit are both fantastic CDs. Emotional and sentimental with superb composition. Highly recommended.
2,"New Agey book on water, not scientific","The book tries so hard to be relevant and interesting. Vortex energy, spiritual nature of water. I'm just not buying it. Don't get me wrong. I love water; I think it's important. And, sure it's mysterious. But it's not that mysterious. Some people may like the author's ideas, but I find them to be science-lite, a bit disappointing for a book on water."
5,Water's Significance Portrayed with Style,"The Holy Order Of Water is an amazing summary of water's significance throughout history and the importance it plays in most cultures, religions and all of life. William Marks' passion about water is evident in this remarkable book that shares the knowledge and experiences he has gathered during his 30 years of work and research with water."
2,Sized for a woman's foot?,These shoes look great but slip on the heel making them very uncomfortable. Perhaps the toe box is too large. I returned my pair before going out of my apartment with them.linda b
2,Ryka SlipOn Water Shoe,"I was recommended to purchase a Ryka water shoe. I chose the slip-on hoping to save myself some money. Unfortunately the shoe was way too tight, so much that my feet cramped almost immediately and I had to finish my water aerobic class barefooted. Now I have shipped them back and will have to spend the extra bucks for the tie type. I will still purchase the Ryka water shoe - it is awesome."
4,Good stuff,"Altogether, a very solid CD. Although I could do without the occasional whining, the rest of the CD makes up for it."
3,Its okay,"I brought this CD because I liked the song off the Coke AD basically (lukewarm). I hoped there would be other similar songs on the album but most of the rest of them are slower, and not as catchy. But not bad."
1,I like Lollypops too but...,"Ah Jim Marrs. Perhaps the JFK assassination is the ""gateway drug"" towards belief in just about anything. His UFO book was marred (natch) by his credulity and selective use of sources. Much the same goes here. It sounds great until you take a breath and realize that this is a guy who believes in the physical reality of the Easter Bunny. I used to think this sort of thing was progressive, as it got people to think critically about the world around them. Unfortunately it seems more like it leads people to the occult, the last stamping ground of those who have given up on the real world."
3,Has to lose credibility,"This book has a lot of good stuff in it. The problem is the author also wrote a book called 'alien agenda'. That pretty much sums up what people think of the whole CFR conspiracy. Right on the front of the book it says, ""from the author of alien agenda"". I'm sorry, but I think this book does more harm than good on convincing anybody to look into it themselves.I suggest reading James Perloff's Shadows of Power."
1,One big pile of garbage,"Poorly written, amazingly contrite and if you like to leap, this book will be great for you because you are required to make so many leaps you'll need to give your legs a rest. I can't believe I wasted time reading this garbage."
5,Rule By Secrecy,"Should be on the ""public"" high school required reading list so those may set up a lifes plan of action --- yeah, right - like that's going to happen.Wake Up America!"
2,Interesting but not credible theory,Jim Marrs has some good points and definitely an interesting theory. The book was actually excellent for the first third part but the last two thirds the book turned out to be deceiving. At the end I almost felt like I was reading a sci-fi book similar to Star Trek. Frankly some of the theories Marrs advances look ok but after careful analysis one cannot but conclude that it is pure fallacy. I would not spend the money on this book and if you really want to read it I suggest going to your public library and flip through the pages especially for the first 100 or so pages - forget about the rest.
5,Its a launching pad for other books,"I read bought this to fill a 5 hour gap in my college classes and to satisfy my above average curiousity about secret societies. what the book ended up doing was creating a whole new train of interest for me, the Crusades and the hoopla around the Holy Grail and the rest of the shananagins of the early middle ages.Those of you with a new found interest in conspiracies will get your fill with this, and may get more than that."
4,Interesting and thought-provoking,"This book was interesting and entertaining. Jim Marrs offers a detailed look at many theories behind secret societies and how these societies may or may not have manipulated history. He even goes deep into the past and touches upon Zecheriah Sitchin's theories of aliens tampering with DNA to create the first humans in ancient Sumer. Lots of info on Freemasons, Illuminati, European Bankers."
3,just a fragment,"Jim Marrs has an excellent body of political research, and its a worthy read for that. I part ways with him on the second part of the book when it moves into the realm of aliens and such, however I would first recommend Springmeier's Bloodlines for a more complete understanding of the power structures.""Rejection without investigation is the height of ignorance"" -David Icke"
5,Excellent Book on Hidden History of History!,"Must-read book. With themes that are similar to David Icke's, author Jim Marrs exposes the secret societies, its members, connections, and their role in major events of world history, and how it leads back to the Ancient Mysteries of ancient Egypt, Sumer, the Knights Templars, and Freemasonry. The author effectively uses references from numerous authors and researchers to support his own research and argument and vice versa."
3,"Conspriacy theory, little support, suprise?","Author makes a number of very interesting claims. His support for the claims is minimal, often quotes apparently taken out of context. Does the author understand Greek|Roman|Babylonian|Sumerian mythology? I have to disagree with many of the mappings made by the author trying to pigeonhole these different ways to organize the world as a surjection. I particularly dislike the sparse evidence of alien ancestors and previous nuclear wars on earth. I hope you don't think that my review is a spoiler because I told you that. If there was a previous atomic bomb detonation, show me the evidence. This should not be difficult, there should be a LOT of it. I also wish there were more solid evidence for these secret societies. What really needs to be done is to create a hypertext document with assertions that you can verify by clicking on them and reading the entire relevant sections of supporting documents and judge for yourself."
4,Good over view,"It presents a good overview of the various conspiracy theories and elite organizations, but I think it tries to crunch on too many at the same time and falls a little short of the mark in wrapping it all up in the end. I don't think anybody could wrap it all up at the end because it is just too big. But that doesn't detract from the individual sections before that. Jim Marrs is one of the best writers in the genre, and this another good read from the author."
4,No secrecy in this book,This is a great book to read to understand how the world financial system began and how it was or is run by just a couple of families or companies. Very interesting....
4,We need to know.,"1. The world needs to know how much of the material in this book is true.2. As the earth becomes more of a global village, the question is asked What secret activities are taking place to enable the ""Secret Group"" discussed in the book to gain power over world affairs?3. While most of the book is well written, there are sections that contain too much repetition of material presented.4. In light of what is happening in the US today with the war, envirnment, and expanding gap between the wealthy and poor, this book needs to receive major public exposure. Our democracy could be in danger."
3,Interesting,"A classic conspiracy book. Marrs makes very interesting arguments in defense of the belief that the world is and forever has been dominated by crazy, greedy men who come together with other crazy, greedy men to form crazy, greedy organizations. I felt Marrs ruined his book at the end when he writes a multi-page account of his apparent belief that the world was created by aliens. Other than that, it was OK."
3,"A Far Reaching Conspiracy Survey, Well Researched","This is a conspiracy theory book that puts forth convincing and coherent evidence for the existence of a power structure in the United States and the World that operates out of the light of the mainstream media to influence world events and status quo. Don't take everything that Marrs says as truth, he draws a lot of his own conclusions and is skillful at convincing the unwary reader of his anti-establishment beliefs. This book follows the influence of secret organizations throughout history and Marrs has a linear story about their connection. By the end of the book his argument is almost entirely hypothetical and hard to believe at best. His warning in the forward is very apt, however, 'If you are happy with your current world view and understanding of world events, do not read this book.' I have a major concern with current affairs and decided to take a look. I am glad I did, but be careful."
4,"If you want to know the truth, read the tabloids!","Some of Marrs'ideas may seem far fetched, especially those raised towards the end of the book, but overall he does make a few very good points.If you are prone to take novel ideas and accept them as facts, approach this book cautiously! However, if you have always wondered if there is more to the publically accepted versions of the truth, this book is a good place to start challenging your existing ideas."
4,"All the names, dates and facts are overwhelming.","I give this book 4 stars because I found the first 2 parts cumbersome to read. As the book went back in history I found it got more and more interesting. I was disappointed that there was no bibliography. There was however a source list to back up facts and information.All in all the book gives a good overview of the ""Big Picture"". What you choose to belive and what you choose to ignore is an individual choice."
2,Threatening to Deliver,"Marrs puts a lot into the title, and precious little into the content. The book meanders thru lists and brief bios of conspiracies without much of a point.So there are a bunch of people consipiring to promote their self interest? Whoopedy du! I was expecting a lot more, like are these people bad? Marrs tells us that they want ""one world government"", but neglects to describe how that is sinister, maybe it would be groovy!Marrs then stretches to tie every wacko outfit in history together with Sitchin's work on Summerian translations, (Read the 12th planet by Sitchin, its interesting, but widely disregarded by experts) to conclude that were all part of, may I say it, some ""Alien Agenda"".I guess as fiction goes, this could be turned into something impressive. As non-fiction, it only threatens to deliver."
5,Educate: fight the New World Order,"This book covers the groups who run the international shadow government:The New World Order, The Council of Foreign Relations (CFR), The Trilateral Commission, The Bilderbergers, The Illuminati, and Freemasonry."
3,"50/50, LIKE FINDING ""NUTS"" IN MY ICE CREAM (*A Haiku Review)","Smorgasbord of facts,Myths, guesswork. Who rules this world?No - Shhhhh! - it's secret.~ Stephen T. McCarthy<""As a dog returns to his own vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.""~ Proverbs 26:11>"
1,Terminal Silliness,"I have worked with more than a few people from CFR and similar organizations. They are generally some of the brightest and influential people in the US and the world, but they are not omniscient, omnipotent, or omni-anything. They're people. Spend your money on a subscription to The Economist and find out how the world really works; don't waste your money on this kind of idiocy."
2,"Laughable Research by a Discredited ""Journalist""","I bought this book because it touched on one of my favorite subjects, Masonry. Touched on is a good phrase, because this book is really a hodgepodge of ""resources"" taken out of context (context, Mr. Marrs, look it up!) to support some very silly ideas. The final chapters dealing with the true ""Ancient Mysteries"" are laughable, and would make a very bad piece of fiction, even. This is not journalism, by any stretch, but, if truly believed by the author, a sign of encroaching dementia. The only reason I give this two stars is it is entertaining in stretches."
3,2/3 Fantastic; 1/3 Wacky,"The first two-thirds of this book is compelling and enormously revealing and I would advise every American to read it!Unfortunately, when you get to the last one-third of the book, the author mostly gets into pure speculative alien-panspermia garbage which goes a long way towards undermining the credibility of what he'd already written. The reader would actually be doing the author a service by just tearing that part of the book right out, it is that damaging to his believability. Why this fellow Marrs wanted to suddenly about-face and abandon factual proofs of conspiracy, and suddenly espouse the whacked-out shadow-rodentia sensationalism of Art Bell and that ilk is beyond me. Ugh. Talk about self-destructing. If Marrs were ever a general in time of war, I can only assume he'd be the type to excel at pulling defeat out of the jaws of victory."
4,Almost pitch perfect,"I, too, wondered about breathing life into dusty old medieval Chaucer, he of the almost incomprehensible ""English"" & ribald observations, & now as an envoy & private eye (perhaps even, a spy) on his master's service, one of the sons of the English King.Turns out this history mistress has written a splendidly peopled, richly described world in which murder & mayhem entrap all who wander by. I know, in these PC times that's not an acceptable word, however, that's what we called our teachers when I was in school & Philippa Morgan is indeed a Mistress of her craft!She kept me reading even when a few anachronisms gave me a giggle. These are likely to evaporate as she becomes more familiar with ""living"" in a world immersed in sights & sounds & smells we've long forgotten. I found the imagined life & times of this fabled literary person enjoyable & fascinating."
2,Disappointing,"Loving Chaucer, I had high hopes for a great read, but I found the book to be disappointing. The story is quite simple and contains no depth--truly no real intrigue while the simple sentence structure distracts from the story. In fact, I find the story boring, and it had such possibilities."
5,JOY is awesome and breaks through the barriers The Secret missed,"Joy is a very special woman who doesn't seem to allow barriers to stop her, as if she says--""Oh, something else I get to jump over to see whats on the other side--OK!"" Flipping the Joy Switch is a powerful tool with sound principles that enable people to access the very best of themselves and others. They are the kind of people that learn that we are all in this together--so lets help ourselves and others by using the Joy Switch tools and leaving the dark worldly illusion behind. Ann Christi"
3,O'Sullivan defunct,"Desk was shipped quickly. Two pieces showed damage when box opened. Tried to contact O'Sullivan on phone number listed in enclosed manual. Recording said O'Sullivan defunct and to get on website to see if supported by another group. Did, no other company listed. Got in touch with Amazon who contacted seller. Seller said Creative Marketing took over for O'Sullivan. I said was waste of my time, the ad on Amazon should have given the facts and not made me have to contact O'Sullivan and Amazon and then be contacted by seller. Seller did send replacement parts promptly. If you buy desk, be aware that you will have to contact seller to get replacement parts, not O'Sullivan, unlike what the manual says. Took six hours to assemble by someone who works in the furniture business."
4,Assisted Me in Forming my S Corp!,I have been looking for a book that details step by step on forming an S Corp. It is light on the accounting end but otherwise I believe it is a good premier on the how to form an s corp. You will still want or need to consult other professionals and also the state and federal guidelines but it is a good read and reference!
3,More for Spanish to English,"It is a nice dictionary but, it is mostly for Spanish to English. For instance, the irregular verbs are English irregular verbs not Spanish irregular verbs. It also has a nice testing program, but it is for English only. The voice is of course mechanical, but it is still nice in that it will try to pronounce anything that you put input into it."
3,Good book for making sect enforcers,"Archons and Templars provides the philosophies and practices of the Camarilla Archons and Sabbat Templars. This a good book for players who want to create the frontline troops of the sects. The new powers are neat and the background information is good, but this book isn't really necessary for experienced players or storytellers. It is not a bad book, but it doesn't really introduce any new concepts to the game. It is good if you want more information regarding the soldiers of the eternal war and feel that the descriptions in the Guides to the Camarilla, Sabbat, and the main sourcebook are not enough."
3,Exceedingly scholarly; hard to digest,"This book displays great erudition. The reference section lists 140 books or articles about quaternions and rotations, going back to the 19th and even 18th centuries. The author shows off his command of this literature, taking a very thorough approach, bringing up subtle points that experts on the subject might not have fully grasped. Unfortunately, for a non-expert like me, the result is often bafflement.Some passages just seem obscure, for example on p 28 ""rotations are an accident of three dimensional space. In spaces of any other dimensions the fundamental operations are reflections"". There is no further discussion of this point, which is far from obvious to me.My background is in computing. I was looking for a general introduction to quaternions and their applications. This book did not meet my objectives. It is inexpensive and well produced but the contents too inaccessible."
1,A big disappointment,"I came to this book with a good understanding of matrices, tensors, complex numbers, quaternions and some quantum mechanics. But I was unsure about spinors, and I hoped this book would help. It didn't.Much time is wasted is confusing and unnecessary quibbles. Each rotation can be represented by either of two quaternions. But which one? Far too much is made of this dilemma. Each rotation has two poles. Far too much is made of this too.The author's plan seems to be to create as much confusion as possible, and then show how quaternions can clean it all up, like a superhero at the end of a movie. Much better to *start* with quaternions and never let the confusion arise in the first place.Dismal."
5,strange subject but gripping acting,a little slow to get going - in the first fifteen minutes i found the accents almost impenetrable - but really gripping (if you like this sort of thing) - couldn't turn it off.
4,Very fine film.,"I thought this was an extraordinary film. I have to say that when the English do films well, they do them really well. This is the story of Albert Pierrepoint who was not the last hangman in England, but who wants to quibble. His precision and his matter of fact approach to the art (he makes it seem like and art) of killing people as quickly and as painlessly as possible is fascinating. His way of approaching his victim is well choreographed and is very understandable. Out standing performances by Timothy Spall and the rest of the cast. Being English of course they are for the most part unknown to the film world outside England but they all give great performances. This is to be watched again and again. A real keeper"
5,One of Best Books I Ever Read!!!!!,One of the most compelling books of all time in my opinion. Great for the kids and the adults too. I highly recommend this book to everyone. To sum up this book I belive that this s one of the best books I have ever read in my life. 5 stars!!!!
2,Not recommended,"The methods and conclusions of Prof. Frederick Neumann's works (publ. in the decades 1970-1990) were rebutted by specialists in Early Music and other publications. This widely-read book makes fascinating and thought-provoking remarks. However (see full analysis in a recent publication: http://play.braybaroque.ie ) the main thesis of Prof. Neumann on Ornamentation (that there were frequent pre-beat trills and mordents in Baroque music) is thoroughly unfounded. This conclusion is not new, being agreed upon by all the present-day scholarly sources on Baroque ornamentation I have been able to find."
1,Not for the faint hearted,"Charlie Tandy may have had his good points, but he worked people to death, over drank and died at 60. He had a great vision and let no one or anything stand in his way. Full of cuss words and swearing. You could read about a lot of other business leaders in a lot better book."
1,Geeze,"These guys played at my school.......they are really really lame, they all had on the same exact outfit. Their music is quite boring, and they were just annoying guys. I went to their website and read there lyrics......wow,that was terrible. They have a song dedicated to smoking pot,boy, is that ever fresh and cool. These bands from the bay area sure are lousy.1 star is generous. [...]"
5,The K.G.B.,"The K.G.B. are amazing musicians. I know one of the guys in the band and they are awesome! I became interested after they played at our school and have been hooked ever since. They sound somewhat like Sugarcult. Listen to the sound clips, you'll love them! Buy the CD, it's GREAT!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The KGB rocks!!,"I first heard them on the radio and I loved their song ""Lover undercover""! It was really catchy and fun. Then I heard they were from Oakland, which is 20 minutes from here! They then performed at our school, we got their autographs and talked to them. They all were really sweet! Buy there CD!!"
4,"Great disc, can't quite come up w/ an analogy","Great disc, nice combo of upbeat (1st half of CD) & mellow tracks (2nd half of CD). A friend & I were trying to come up with an analogous group or genre, but it wasn't easy, which is why KGB is a blast to listen to. Complex tracks, hints of everyone from the Beatles (""In Case of A Bad Trip..."") to Jamiroquoi (""Long$hot"") to Cake (""Isabella""), imo. They're from the SF Bay Area."
3,Catchy but lightweight,"The K.G.B. plays the same kind of energetic, lightweight pop with ska/punk influences that has been recently been popularized by bands like the Mighty Might Bosstones or Smash Mouth.The songs on this album are all suitably danceable and catchy, as you'd expect from a band whose line up includes a trombone and trumpet player, but there's not much originality on display here.There aren't many shifts in tone and style here, with the sole exception of a cover of Squeeze's ""Goodbye Girl"".It's fitting that ""Fortune and Fame"", the opening and best song on this CD, is featured in the movie ""RoadTrip"" with the band shown performing it during the frat party, early in the movie:this is probably a band best experienced live, in a party-like environment, than on record."
4,KGB Rox The House!!!,"I got to see KGB perform live in Oakland and they totally rocked the house! I've heard their song ""Lover Undercover"" before and I didn't really know what to make of it, but when those guys performed live, I became addicted. They are a small town group gone big and they have the extreme talent to go far. They are as fun as the group Blink-182, but have the talent of true punk/rock stars. Give these guys a chance and see them live! Go KGB!!!"
2,Sketchy,"The product is nice looking and works alright, but it says it supports up to 99lbs. It definitely cannot handle my 90lb 27"" tv. I had to move the tv several inches back from the front of the mount just so it wouldn't tilt all the way foward. The tv is so wobbly on the mount that if you touch it, it will continue to move for about 30 seconds. If you have a much lighter tv, this product will probably work fine, but i wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Audiovox FPE3000: didn't last long, no parts available","I bought Audiovox FPE3000 about 3.5 years ago in Sam's Club and paid for it about $1,200. Was working fine at the beginning but 1.5 years down the road pair of visible vertical marks were developed. Most of the programming we watched were in 4:3 format and the edges of these format burned these vertical marks which were readily seen when switched to 16:9 ratio. Finally, 3.5 years after purchasing, the TV died. I called Audiovox customer service dept and was told that there is now warranty on any parts including the light bulb which supposed to last 50,000 hours (which is equivalent to 5.7 years of non-stop work 24/365). I was also told that there are nor replacement parts available (without even asking which parts I may need) and suggested to call 4-6 weeks later (!) to find out about parts.I'd say steer away from this brand if you are looking for a new TV. There are better options out there in terms of quality and customer service."
1,This guide is wrong in SOOOO many ways.,"This guide is so full of errors. Errors that really can affect the quality of your gameplay. Their furniture list is wrong, the museum info, what you can and cannot buy back from the nookmeister, when and where to find fish and bugs, some of the song names for totokeke. event happenings, parts or all of these things are wrong.This guide is a complete waste of money.Not to mention the lists are neither alphbetical nor in the same order they appear in your catalog, and there are no pictures of the items, so finding things for reference is next to impossible"
2,Buy the Nintendo guide instead,This one is simply not in the same league. Don't settle for less. Get the Nintendo version.
1,Bad Day for Prima,"Although Prima has written many good guides, this is not one of them. It stinks. Descriptions are weak, strategies poor, and instructions difficult to follow."
2,"Okay, but Nintendo's Offical Guide is better.","I was fliping through it in a store. It's okay, but it mainly tells you what items are, where to get/find them, and has an inventorylike apperance. Before I left, I also looked at the Nintendo Offical Stratigy Guide. Nintendo's guide tells you about different items and where to find/get them or earn them. It also has a different layout and better info. Like I said it's okay, but Nintendo's is better."
1,"If you are here, you must be crazy","As one said before me, get NP guide for Animal Crossing. Skimming through the catalog is like skimming through the yellow pages, the layout is terrible, and it is not the funnest thing to read. It is not very detailed and does not touch every peice of info, either. I'd have expected better from Prima."
2,why?,"I skimmed through it in a store, and I thought to myself, ""why would I need a guide to a game that has no plot, where the town itself is made up randomly, and dosen't truely have an end?"" Thankfully the voices in my head has no ready reply, but regardless, get the game, not the guide. Great game! Love it! But guide? No."
3,"good visual, music ok","This video is good for anyone who is new to spinning or a beginner and wants to get started on an in-home program. The program is very basic and easy to follow. Like all of the videos in the Reebok line, this is very technically sound, provides a good workout, but is a little bland.The camera takes you on a ""bike's eye"" tour of Hawaii, which is pretty neat. The music however, is not very motivational. One of the best parts of taking a spinning class is the intensity of the music, and this does not deliver that at all."
3,Anything is better than staring at the wall,"Although I have never attended a spinning class, I do ride a stationary bike at home. This video is not the best instructional video I have seen, but it does have some great scenery. The instruction is very low key, and the inset pictures of the instructor are helpful especially when the volume is low. While not great, this video does give you a good workout and makes the 30 minutes go by a lot faster than watching the evening news!! I have an inexpensive stationary bike and it works just fine for these excersizes."
5,You'll love it!,"NoreenFull House Michelle My Fourth Grade MessI read this book and I loved it. This is about Michelle and her first math test: the day of the test arived. Michelle was so nervous. When the test began Michelle noticed that a boy in her class, named Jeff was copying off her test. Michelle knew he was cheating but he called her his pal and he is one of the popularest kid in the fourth grade. She coud not tell the teacher, because if she does everyone will call her a snitch. If she doesn't everyone will think that she cheated on her test. What will Michelle do? If you want to find out what happened next, youbetter read this book. You'll love it!!!!!"
3,My Fourth Grade Mess,"I am 6 yrs. old and in Kindergarten. This is the first Full House Michelle book that I bought. I liked ""My Fourth Grade Mess"" but not as much as ""How to Be Cool"" because ""How to be Cool"" was funnier. ""My Fourth Grade Mess"" is about how Michelle's teacher thought that she cheated on a math test because her paper and Jeff's paper were the same. Her teacher gives her a note that tells her Dad to come over in the afternoon to talk about her cheating. Then the teacher gives Jeff a note, too, because the teacher wants to find out what really happened. Who really cheated?"
5,My first Full House Michelle book!,"Hello,this book was the first book I ever had from Full House!And I love it so much that I want them al!This is a good book for kids who don't know what to do in the vacations!But it's not fear for Michelle who worked so hard for her test and then she's the one who gets in problems. But that problem is not forever! You'll love it!"
1,This book was pretty boring,"This book was short, easy to read, and boring. It took me only 27 minutes to read...that is pretty fast. The book was very obvious. Like no one believes that she wasn't the one cheating and Jeff saying it is no big deal...I think this book was a waste of time to read."
2,Don`t buy !,I bought this item thinking it was very cute . when I got it I wore it for two days and the upper hand of the lizard kept rubbing my piercing. it infected my belly-button very badly. Don`t buy this item unless you are looking to get your piercing infected.
3,belly ring,"This product is I love, it does have one fault though: the paint started to come off after a couple times of wearing it."
1,Don't waste your money- RATING: ZERO STARS,I bought this watch in royal blue and in less than 60 days it stopped working. I took it for a battery change but that did not make it run.The jeweler said the battery was still good. Amazon wouldn't take it back since it was over 30 days. MY ADVICE- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON MOMENTUM PRODUCTS. The site doesn't accept zero stars.
4,Authentic and Interesting Autobiography,"It's a great first hand report from a young woman growing up in the Alaskan outback in the early 20th century. An amazingly hard, isolated life, full of lots of adventures. In many ways a more complete description of eking out a living, surviving, and growing up than Little House on the Prairie By Laura Ingalls Wilder, to which it is somewhat similar. A great read! Especially, if you're contemplating life in remote areas of Alaska."
5,Great Choir and Orchestral use.,"With a slight twist to his usual heroic, bouncy and often catchy themes, John Powell incorporates the wonderful use of choir to make this another stand out score. Ratrace carries along the comedy and fun right through to the music. If its the main theme in ""The Chase begins"" or variations like in ""all the little children"" or the wonderful almost tropical closing cue ""before we were russian"", this score will keep you glued, and entertained. A big recomendation, especialy if you like Powell's other works."
3,Loved the Movie...,"The theatrical release RAT RACE was in my dictionary, the FUNNIEST movie ever made. The music was great, but they only had to make ONE soundtrack. I have the other one which has: Baha Men, Smash Mouth, Colony, Four Tops, and Hot Chocolate. I reccomend you buy the VARIOUS ARTISITS one because it has a much more wide selection. Plus it has many songs from this CD too (or at least the good ones.) So if you liked the music from the movie, buy the other one. PS- YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"
5,Standing Up,"Fighting Back, by Harold Werner, is the well told story of a group of Jewish partisans, who instead of quietly submitting to the will of their Nazi oppressors, and those anti-semitic villagers, and there seemed to be many, who collaborated with the Nazis in their quest to destroy the Jews of Poland, decided to fight back. The author was one of those partisans. These people had all lost family members and friends to both the Nazis and to many of their neighbors who had once been their friends, and all they wanted was a chance to fight back, an opportunity for revenge. After reading many holocaust books about the camps, or about Jews in hiding, it was a pleasure to finally read one where the Jews actually defended themselves, and if they had to die, they died ""Fighting Back."" This is a must read."
2,Almost a disgrace to the RE series,"In Resident Evil: Survivor, you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past. The first thing you'll notice about the game is it's first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not (yet it's Japanese counterpart does). That major drawback, combined with the choppy animation, muddy sound, poor controls, and near none replayability, make Resident Evil: Survivor one big disappointment of a game. It's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series, but don't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga. Capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed Resident Evil game called Resident Evil: Dead Aim for the PS2, and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crud."
2,Survivor?,This game was the worst of all the resident evil games the only reason why i played the whole thing is to get to the end. i bought the game thinking it would be a cool resident evil game but it wasnt the aiming was hard to control and 2 hours later i beat the game and have never touched it again. if i were u id just read what people say about the game and let it stay like that.
1,man this is soooooo dumb,okay look to buy this game youed need to be on somthing this game is easy i beat it in a hour and 2 min dont waste your mony i only got it because it looked kool rent then buy but if you do be ready to laugh at it then beat it with no difrent ending (exsept for who dies at yhe end) I was dis aponted with the tirant so no buy
2,Would Have Been Great........If it had guncon,"Well To start off, over all the game sucks. The Story Line is ok but it is more a BOOM BOOM BOOM story line. The Grapics are not as bad as they say, But its still boing overall. If it came with guncon support, and you could still walk around with the controler, it would have been great just because shooting the screen adds alot (for some reason) also CG cut sceens would have been nice. So this game is worth renting, but since there is no gun support a game the take 1 hour to beat (which would be ok if you could use the gun) Is only worth renting"
1,NnyCW for Capcom City,"Resident Evil Survivor, the black sheep of the Resident Evil family. Compared to the rest of the Resident Evil's, yes, this game is bad. However, it is not unplayable. The lack of any and all save points means that you're going to have to go thru the entire game in one sitting...and that can be quite a challenge. However, considering how easy the game is, it's not because of difficulty. This game just is bad. Now, if you have a bunch of friends over who love Resident Evil like you do and you just want to be able to say you beat them all, this game does have some redeeming value. It's great for a laugh with a group of friends at just how bad it is. This game is more of a collectors item for those who want to have the entire Resident Evil series and who want to beat them all rather than for those who want a fun and enjoyable game to play. Stay away unless you're Resident Evil thru and thru. NnyCW for CapCity."
2,Resident Evil Survivor,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be, it was kind of disappointing. I got all hyped up about it for nothing. The graphics and sound were bad, not to mention the story. It isn't worth the $ 30. The first Resident Evil is worth $ 30. I'm excited to play Resident Evil Code Veronica ( originally for Sega Dream Cast in Spring of 2000 ) for the Playstation 2 out in July I think. Code Veronica is the best Resident Evil game I've ever played, and is well worth the money."
2,not a real great game,"this RE game is by far the worst one. The controls are poor, the story really isn't that great, and doesn't add all that much to the actual RE plot. It's more of a Tangent to the storyline than anything else. It was also way too short, as it only took me about 2 hours to beat, and there are no save points. There are no real shocking or really really scary moments as in all the other RE games. It is also very easy to pass better weapons as I did on my 1st time through the game. (I missed all but like 2 or 3 weapons)"
4,The One And Only Shoot'em Game,"I had the luck to play the Japanese verson and it rocks. I loved the game play and the graphics are awesome. The only thing I was disappointed about was the time it took to beet it. Other than that, this belongs with everyone's RE collection."
4,Very Different but Not Bad,"This is very different but it is not bad. This is nothing like the other resident evil. It is first person. The controls are pretty good and the gameplay is good. It is not a bad game. Maybe not the best Resident Evil but hey, its fun."
1,This SUCKS!!!,Why could they not make a better story in the stupid game.And most of all what the hell happned to Leon Kennedy.He comes out in part 2 and that is the end of him.They don't talk about him no more or what happens to him.They could have put him in this part with a better story.
2,RE Worst,RE Survivor was very disappointing for it lacked the thrill of the previous RE series. I definately did not like not being able to see my surroundings or if I had a creature behind me...... I felt like returning the stupid game because it was one big waste.So Please Please save your money on another game
3,"Good, but not great","Ok, RE fans, this is the one you have been waiting for. Ok, well, mabee not. Here it is in a nutshell. Pros: Cool 1st person perspective, new characters, new story Cons: Redundant story line, sluggish fight ability, same ol' weapons, not as challenging.Overall, if you are an RE fan, you will enjoy this game. With the 1st person perspective, it gives a new meaning to ""survival horror"". Places you can hear things but cannot see them. Also, the new characters are entertaining, but the story needs work. Also, toward the end, the music becomes a bit bothersome, but nothing you cannot ignore. The graphics are not as good as previous versions. (looking forward to PS2, are we? )There is A LOT less challenge, including puzzles to solve and items to get. Yet, this game was a fun romp through another biohazzard shoot-em-up kinda town. Just leave your brain at the door, and get ready for some zombie-killin fun!"
1,Atrocious at best,"Don't waste on second of your time with this game.It belongs in the trash. No saves,2 hours to beat the whole game,and the worst graphics ever.You'd have more fun being attacked by a rabid dog than playing this game. Just say no to this one.It's not even worth renting!!"
2,easy,"this game was easy. I beat it in one hour. who in thair right mind would like this game. sure it was fun ...... for the first hour. thairs no new ending depending on wich rout you take (besides who gets killed at the end) over all it was too easy. I would stick to 1,2,3, and code veranica."
3,this is a okay game,this game is a okay game but i rocmend that u rent it first so than u csn see if u like it or not the grahic are so so the game has a good story plot. it about this guy that is a scret agent that get abmisa and thiks he somwe one eals but later in the game he finds out who he rellay is thats all i'm going to tell u so rent the game and find out for your self.
2,Thumbs down --> Can't save!,The fact that you can not save your game is really a big draw back...you can save only if you die...
3,I wish it never would've happened.,"As upset as I was about the whole fact that Capcom ever deviated from the original pre-rendered screens I have to admit the game Resident Evil Survivor provides a few minutes of action. It is way too easy, but the Resident Evil title is enough to earn it 3 stars. I played the import which really wasn't all that great. The story provided few surprises and didn't shed much if any light on the original plot of the series."
5,"Its a good game, Oh yes it is!","One of the best games ever played on this planet, NOW ON MARS, IT WOULD BE SPIDERMAN ON PLAYSTATION, however since this is earth, i will have to consider this is an all time favorite all fans of pure horror. it doesn't let you down like those pathetic horror movies of the new millenium. this game has actual horror and the puzzles are tough, they are so tough, that this game and others like it are helping decline the ratings of the wwe. this game and spongebob square pants are taking vince to the cleaners."
4,the black sheep of residental evil,im a die hard resident evil fanatic and well the game itself i enjoyed it.the controls are very bad in the game the graphics are lacking compared to the other playstation one resident evil games.but i did like the story line and the fact that the name says it all survivor.what i mean above is the fact that there are no save points it makes it more of a challenge and you have to think ahead with all of your items.there are a limited amount of continues but overall its a fun game and the story line is good.
3,Decent Game,"I'm a die-hard Resident Evil fan, so I got this one. I've only played it on my PS2 and it works great. However, you can't save the game, so you have to beat it in one sitting. I like that it's inventive, with the first person perspective, no track to follow, and the ability to carry an unlimited amount of items. Only get this if you love Resident Evil."
3,Resident Evil Messup,"Capcom is really overdoing this franchise.Personaly I am a big fan of RE games but this one is just messed up. RE is supossed to be a ""cinmatic"" Game. First: This is a first person shooter RE. 2nd you have to play the hole game in one sitting.Third :the great ""pop out of your seat moments"" are spoiled buy the stupid first person veiw. If you want a good RE game stick with the other four games or if you can wait,wait for RE:Zero."
2,Biohazard,"Residant Evil: Survivor or Biohazard: Survivor (Japanese name)is not at all like I had expected. There was practicly no blood...let alone gore. I played it a a movie theater (even though it was called Biohazard, I knew it was the same thing) and after I was done I thought ""What a waste of money!"" So whoever you are viewing my review, DON'T BUY IT...BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!"
1,Dont waste your money on this one.,"A complete waste of time for any Resident Evil fan. I cant belive Capcom actually put this game out without light gun support. The game play is terrible, and zombies dont react to certain spots when you shoot them; I had to shoot one five times in the head just to bring it down. The story seems like it was written up in less than two hours, and the characters are the worst. If you want a better time, buy one of the RE books, there a million times better than this."
1,Capcom why I ask why?,This rates up there with my Sega GT review for worst game ever. Worst graphics I have ever seen for a playstation game and the system is in its 6th year now. All I want to ask Capcom is why release this trash to the public. I'm the biggest Resident Evil saga fan ever. I bought this game with high hopes and was let down by the biggest video game company in the business. I played it for about an hour couldnt take it anymore and threw the game out of the window. Capcom why I ask why?
1,What a load of TRASH!,"I rented this game a couple days ago, and it[s] really, really [bad] The graphics are the worst I've seen in a Resident Evil game and the plot itself is laughable. The first person shooter option [is] totally [bad] too... I'm warning you people not to buy or even rent the trash! What a waste of my money! Whoever gave this game more than one star does'nt know what real video games are! Play Resident Evil games, except this one. Complete Garbage!"
1,This game is a joke!,"Ok let me tell you this. RENT DONT EVEN DARE BUY! The only thing that kicks on this game is first person view mode. But this game is not even fun. You work for umbrella in some crazy city a little after resident evil 3 and you fall from a helicopter and get amnesia not knowing you are the most feared person in the world. You screw around killing zombies but you never ever ever get to have any fun at all. Whats with capcom now? Why are they so lazy now when it comes that they make even greater games than konami does. Now one game i reccomend is Resident Evil Code Veronica, its very fun."
4,"A good game that had good intention, but got off track","Survivor was a good game in my mind, possibly because Im obsessed with everything Resident Evil! I believe capcom meant well with this game but got sidetracked in the development of other RE titles. I higly reccomend everyone to purchase this game I enjoyed it alot ( it could have been better!!!!, BUT IT STILL KICKS!!!!!!)"
5,Seasonality and photoperiodism,"I'm working on the problem of neanderthals. Seasonality was one of the main hard things they had to live with; another was the intruders (H.sapiens). The latter had one special advantace they were better in breeding, having more childern. One must also remember that H sap was a neotenic species: sub ad exx could have children. And if the environment was hostile and one had to move along just after childs birth, that was fatal."
3,Worst book binding ever encountered,"This is a fine reference for Hebrew Bible verb parsing, but the book binding is absolutely terrible. The book does not stay open and the pages fall off when one tries to keep it stay open. A new and better binding edition (possibly hard cover) is sorely needed because this book should serve as a lifelong companion to the Hebrew Bible for non-scholars to read the Old Testament in the original language. Rating of the book is the average of 5 (for the content) plus 1 (for binding) divided by 2 equaling 3 stars.Jan 18, 2010Addition to my previous comment.Be aware, Buyers! I have contacted the publisher about the poor quality biding problem, and they don't care about the concern. You may be spending more money than bargained for, because of the problem, if you want to keep using the book - I did!"
1,"Kindle Version ""Under Review"" Forever","I would love to buy this book in the Kindle version, but there seems to be some tech problem with that version. There is a note that the Kindle Version is ""under review"" and that the publisher is working to fix the problem, but the note has been up for almost a year now, and nothing happens. I got in touch with the publisher and the author, and at first they got back to me and promised to look into it, but nothing happened. I tried again a couple of months later and they didn't respond. Amazon: If there is no movement on this issue, you should stop listing the product."
4,Old Testament Parsing Guide: Revised and Updated Edition,"The parsing of all OT verbs comes in handy with a parsing guide like this. Even though beginners should not over-depend on such tool when learning Biblical Hebrew, it is still good to have a well-printed book like this for easy reference."
2,bad racing game,"this game is probably the worst racing game i have ever played. that is probably because i have played midnight club 2, need for speed: hot pursuit 2, need for speed underground. Also you aren't required to turn because it is mostly drag racing. the upgrades are kind of good and sound is good. only buy if you are desperate. i recommend midnight club 2 instead of this game."
5,"If you love New Mexico, buy this book","If you ever read books of Tony Hillerman, be sure to take a look at this book. His love of the state of New Mexico is well known by readers of the Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn Mysteries, but this book is about the overwhelming beauty of the state. The vast open spaces, the silence and the history. This collection of essays together with the outstanding photographs is a must."
3,"Wonderful writing, great photos, bad print job.","If Only!If only this book had been printed by the National Geographic Society, or Arizona Highways, or somebody who specializes in scenic calendars. The fabulous photos in here deserve top quality printing, and they didn't get it.However, I heartily recommend this book to all my fellow Hillerman fans, *anyway*, because the essays are great, and the background information on some of the events that inspired scenes in certain of the novels is priceless. If you loved 'A Thief of Time' as much as I did, you'll very much enjoy the descriptions of the actual site that inspired it. Hillerman's 'travelogue' down the Rio Grande is also wonderful."
4,picture is not right,"it perfectly fit my 2004 xterra S/C model, but item received is different with image shown here. i was surprised by its quality because it looks even better my old OEM one. For those xterra owner, this item doesn;t fit V6 N/A model."
4,Omni Trio - Byte Size Life,"I'm not sure why, but BYTE SIZE LIFE doesn't grab me as much as Omni Trio's other albums. It's plenty precise and clinical as his other work, and it has some melodic flair, but just not as much, I suppose. ""Sound System"" and ""Revolver,"" for example, both sound slightly thin emotionally. The title track recaptures some of his earlier magic, and ""Assassins"" is appealingly dark, even if it doesn't quite hit the mark. Not surprisingly, ""Brothers in Detroit"" does have plenty of the Detroit techno sounds with deep, dreamy synth pads and Haigh's own trademark breaks. ""Native Place"" helps bring back the soul to the machines as well. Big Bud's mix of ""Beyond the Fundamental"" has much more Big Bud than Omni Trio, but ""Radio Sirus"" brings Haigh swirling back in fine form. Shimon does a dark take on ""Byte Size Life,"" but all things considering, a 'pretty good' Omni Trio album still stands head-and-shoulders above most others."
1,Do not buy this book!,This book has no content. Just a lot of common sense tips that everyone use off the phone as well as on the phone in sales. Out of the 501 tips I probably came away with 10 tips that was useful. Don't waste your money.
5,anderson83ster,I like his writing - some more than others as he does get a bit repetitive - but it sure gets me all set to completely do my yard - at least in my head!
3,hard or soft cover?,"I ordered this item item anticipating a hardback book, and it is a paperback book."
4,Worth seeing on DVD,"I love the erotic feel of the lighting , colors, and especially the music. (How about a soundtrack release?). One full frontal nudity scene of Blue is cut from this DVD, it's on the unrated VHS."
2,Oh well.,"I had seen this one before, I guess I had forgotten all about the story line. I wasn't as fond of this one as I am of the first one."
5,Wild Orchid 2 Bue movie Blue,"I had seen this movie years ago. I enjoyed this movie as much as I did then, Very sexy , provacative and interesting."
2,Wild Orcid II-Two Shades of Blue,"It is a Zalman King production-beautiful bodies, grat sets, and little plot. This movie is especially silly and not that erotic. Save your money."
4,A sequel that stands on it's own...,"Not really a sequel, but another richly filmed erotic story that you won't forget."
4,I Like it !,"This is a really nice CD. the songs are good, the singing is good and overall it's a strong record. I've seen these guys live with their whole band and they're really tight. They have even better stuff live than is on the CD."
4,"The Hope of the ""Crisp""","Hurling towards the final apocalypse, of mankind's own creation, earth's race against time is led by Professor Arnold Mason. The course of earth's journey has already been mapped, but Professor Mason and his followers are mapping their own course for the future of the human race - found in the face of a child. The fast paced, tight, novelette, with surprising twists, reflects the urgent need to ""shield"" the ""children"" from the terrible fate of the ""crisp"" by propelling them towards a New World. I eagerly look forward to the next book in the series, where the children begin a new life."
2,My Thoughts on The Crisp,"I am not a fan of this book. I found myself thoroughly bored after the first 12 pages. This is NOT one of Paul's best works. Cobwebs was intriguing, however; while The Crisp just didn't cut it. Sorry Paul. You get a thumbs down for this one."
3,A Guideline for Other Authors,Gregg Braden has delivered several books which basically contain the same information over and over again...
4,Great teachings,It's great to have this kind of teaching on audio. Makes it really easily accessible.
3,The Isaiah Effect,"I've only listened to ""The Isaiah Effect."" There is lots and lots of ""filler."" He repeats the same vague generalities many times. I was hoping for something more specific. Haven't listened to the others yet."
3,1/32 F-117 Nighthawk,"The kit hasn't got much detail, but, it sure goes together real nice. It is well worth the price, but, Testors has got to package it up better at the factory to prevent parts from getting broken in transit. there aren't enough parts in the box to make everything tight,so it needs some packing. bubble wrap, maybe, inside the box, not around the box? I would sure like Testors to put out some more ""NEW"" kits at their affordable prices,because I was raised on Testors kits, and, they are still in the realm of reality pricewise compared to the other makers. Go Testors!Telly69er-red"
3,Worth reading,This book seems to be a summary of the book Dark Hart by Margaret Weis and David Baldwin which was a very good book. The illustrations in this book really help to put a mental picture together about what the setting and charters in Dark Hart were like and the stories about Justin Sterlings(the main charters in Dark Hart) past are really enjoyable. If you are interested in reading this book you will enjoy it much more if you read Dark Hart first.
5,Robbed,"I gave this 5 stars for the quality of the writing,the characters seemed to just start to be developed and then it was over. It was a miss mash of stories that started in the future and then went back in time to, two other events that did not have a decent conclusion. It keeps one hanging. The story was full of death and violence, then with one swoop of a females influence Justin changes his years of loyalty. From other reviews I guess there is a book called Dark Hart that would have helped better understand this novella, but no where on this book is there a reference to another book. I felt robbed and frustrated by this book."
1,"Overpriced; no plot, no point","It isn't that this novel is so bad, but, compared to the mastery of the Dragonlance chronicles, legends, and tales, as well as the quintet of Darksword novels, it seems that this 96-page tripe was simply created for the money. Sad, so sad"
1,did'nt last,"used for less than a year and it died.Switch to a Bosch,100% better and still going after heavy use.Much better product,you can hear and feel the differance."
2,Only for lightweight items,"I got these hooks from a local retailer and the hook broke off within a week of using it. I used it on my office desk to hang my keys (5 keys and a car transmitter) which weigh 3.3 oz (yes, I weighed them). The magnet is pretty weak also. With my keys on the hook, it slides down a little on the metal surface before it stops. If I lightly bump the desk with my knee, the hook will completely slide off the desk. Unfortunately, there was no indication of a weight limitation on these hooks."
2,Weak magnet,Especially ineffective mounted on vertical surface - intended use on side of fridge to hold ladles - would either slide down and/or fall off whenever I hang a utensil - seem to be stronger when mounted under a horizontal surface.
5,Magnetic Hooks,"These magnetic hooks are great for hanging all sorts of things on my refrigerator, toolbox and locker at work. They are good for holding things like car keys, oven mitts, bottle openers, kitchen untensils, notes, and the list goes on."
3,Good to hold light things,I recieved this and one of the hooks was broken. So I wasn't happy. However the other three work well on the fridge to hold up pot holders....
2,Great hooks but not for outside use,"I bought these hooks to hang grilling tools on my BBQ grill.The magnets are great... very strongUnfortunately in less than a week the hooks began rusting.I suspect they will soon become, weeping, rusting attachments to my grill.Too bad. I'd have paid double to have them stainless, non rusting versions."
1,Weak...,"Great concept but poor execution. When I try to put my keys on the hook, the whole thing just slides down. To try to fix the problem, I have to put a strong magnet under the magnetic hook, but even then, it still slides and little and often falls off completely. Disappointing..."
1,Weak weak weak,"A waste of natural resources. These won't hold anything. Bought a set to hang fabric decoration (patriotic red, white and blue poly-cotton bunting) from the edge of the steel roof on our house. Dismal result. Don't waste your time and money on this item."
3,Potholders only....barely.,"These are not very strong magnets, but so far have kept my potholders on my fridge. I doubt it can hold anything much heavier. These are really cheap, dollar store quality but if you're looking for an inexpensive set and aren't planning to hang curtains (or even an apron for that matter) these might do. The package is extremely vague about their weight usefulness and mostly just tell you their warranty is very limited. Gee, I wonder why? Go with a stronger magnet. They might cost more but you'll more than likely have to worry less. Use these to hold up your grocery lists."
2,It was not as expected.,"Considering the price, but linked to other similar instruments, this guitar is quite inferior to what it should. Very bad ending."
4,Well it is 30 dollars,"It is cheap lol... first time using you have to tune it about 6 times but it plays music.. and for 30 dollars that's all you can ask from a guitar. it dosent sound that good and volume is low. I would never recoment this as a primary starter guitar, but as a secondary guitar thats easy to take places. I bought this because I wanted a cheap guitar i can take to work and practice on down time. Works for me =) not bad for 30$."
1,Don't bother,The Irish culture according to an an Englishman's perspective. Truth? Maybe some of it. Stereotypes? Yes.
3,it was ok,it was good for a few months then had a hole from what who knows point is its cheap. both in quality and in price so I say go with this.
5,The best hairspray on earth.,The best hairspray on earth. I love being able to order both items online! Both came very quickly!
1,Stinks,"My bride says it works really well. However, I can't stand to get anywhere near her hair because of the powerful, horrible smell. Want romance? Then wash it out so you don't gag your partner."
3,Poor packaging,"Arrived super fast, for which I am grateful, but unfortunately, really poor packaging that caused the bottle to dent. The product works fine, but if someone is going to pay $18-20 bucks for a bottle of hairspray, the merchant should deliver the bottle in an undamaged form."
2,Hair Spray,"I ordered this product for my wife. She told me it didn't work, would not hold...Also I ordered two bottles, got charged for that, but only recieved one bottle!!"
5,Wonderful Hair Spray!,"Great hold, not too sticky. Little goes a long way, though. Best to spray from several inches from head since it is very concentrated!"
5,Kenra is the best hair spray out there.,"Kenra Volume Spray is the best spray on the market. It has the hold, makes one's hair shiny, and one bottle lasts a long time. I have tried other sprays by name brands and famous stylists, but they did not work as well and/or had obnoxious smells. This is the only hair spray I will use."
2,Didn't work for me,"Interestingly enough, even though I had high hopes for this product, I wasn't overly impressed with it. I found the hold a bit too intense and the smell gave me a headache...In fairness I should note that I do have problems with strong scents, so others may not find the smell offensive."
4,"A good guide, especially if you're out for self-improvement","In the service dress is usually decided for you. This book explains the do's and don'ts of a gentleman's wardrobe, what sort of clothes the gentleman should look for and when to wear them. I really enjoyed this book, and it even has illustrations on how to tie different tie knots (I know how to tie one but I didn't realize the knot I was using had a name). Well worth the time and effort to get."
2,Gentleman,"Flusser's ""Dressing the Man"" is vastly superior in terms of both content and comprehensiveness. Generally speaking, I found the ""Gentelemen"" book series to be either common sense or just plain wrong. If you want a very short reference guide, though, this is better than nothing."
2,Simplistic,"I was expecting a more detailed description of traditional menswear and the correct way to wear things, with illustrations. Instead it was a book of homilies ""A gentleman always ....' and ""a gentleman never....."", albeit with some humor. There wasn't much I didn't already know."
2,So little substance...,"I read this entire book in under one hour. It is so limited in its focus and provides so little useful commentary that I really can't recommend it. There are some funny moments and an occassional piece of useful advice, but for the most part, it just isn't worth your time or money."
5,HE' S OUTSTANDING,"CHARLIE DROPPED A BOMB ON US ON THIS ALBUM, HIS VOCALS ARE GREAT.NOW I SEE WHY AARON HALL AND ALOT OF R&B SINGERS IN THE EARLY 90'S TRIED TO IMMITATE HIM. THE BEST SONGS TO ME ARE ""THRU IT ALL"", ""NO WORDS"",""SO HOT"", ""ASKING QUESTIONS"
3,"Charlie, Last Name Wilson","I always thought he had a nice voice, but after listening to this cd and his latest I am now a fan. I will say that all the guest singers were ok, but I don't like that whole mixing the rap with the real old school singers. Overall good cd."
3,just ok,"all i can say it that it's just ok. A few good songs, not crazy about the justin song, I think the Snoop song is Great, check out Snoops cd, the song that Charlie is on is better. but all and all not a bad cd, just not great!"
4,"Charlie, Last Name Wilson",CD arrived in great condition and on time. No complaints here...and the price was right.
4,tight jam,"this sog was written,produced and arranged by the King of R&B R.kelly and it fits the Great and soulful sounds fo Charlie Wilson to a t. the song was so cool when it came out in 05 and it still sounds good. Charlie Wilson still has that ""IT"". right on."
5,"One Word ""OUTSTANDING""",UNCLE CHARLIE IS THE MAN THIS CD IS OFF THE HOOK NICE & MELLOW FOR THE GROWN & SEXY
1,Savannah Bird Girl - Large,"I loved this statue and thus ordered and received it. Later on it fell over on my wall-to-wall carpet and the head broke off and the arm cracked. Despite my correspondence with Signals, the best offer I received was a 35% off offer on a new statue priced at $189. The poor girl sits on my patio awaiting my being able to find any type of adhesive produce to put her together again. If you know of a product which will bind her permanently, I would appreciate it as despite her obvious flaws even if fixed I do like this statue a great deal."
1,Very Hard To Use,I normally don't review products but I just had to throw in my two cents here. We bought this for my 3 year old (he is on the upper end of the age recommendation). It is just about impossible to explain to a three year old that you need to look straight ahead in the tiny opening to see the bottom of the tub. We have also tried it ourselves and it is very hard to see anything. I definitely would not waste my money on this product.
3,Slightly scattered,"Originally to be published by the now-defunct and much-missed comics publisher Eclipse, later released as part of Image Comics' ""no-line,"" and now reprinted in one volume by Somerville-based Cyberosia, Cathedral Child is a manga-styled missive that'd reputedly the first volume in a sequence called Texas Steampunk. While there are some steampunk elements present -- a sentient cathedral that communicates via pipe organ -- I found the comic to be slightly scattered. Part lifelong romance, part mystery, and part political powerplay, the story's ideas are important, but the sequence suffers from unclear characterization and too twisted a narrative thread. Hernandez's Author's Notes are helpful, but a comic shouldn't need footnotes to be forthright. That said, the vision is viable. It's the execution that could have been cleaner...."
5,Delightful,"All in Italian, I have no idea what any of the songs mean (except 'beautiful and impossible') but this is a favorite, turn down the lights, evening at home with just the two of you and Gianna. Her voice is deep and seductive, the songs perfectly paced with rythmic motion. An excellent gift item for someone you want to know better."
4,One Of The Best,I bought this album as a way to reconnect to some of the music from my youth and upon listening to it when it arrived I was instantly transported back to those days!This best of compilation truly gives you some of the more memorable tracks from MH...one of the premier bass musicians and singers from the not too distant past(I still have his work on vinyl).Now that I have gotten a re-taste of how great his music was and is I am set on buying as much of his body of work in digital format as I can get my hands on.This would be a great intro to the classic funk/jazz/R&B/ sound for anyone looking to reminisce or experience great music played by great musicians!
5,The Best of Michael Henderson,"Very nice old school music. I wish the ""new school"" folks would take lessons from people like M. Henderson."
1,??,Although I did order this the sender never shipped it. I got my money back but wouldn't use the company again.
5,Enormously helpful,"I have been reading Gibbon's DECLINE AND FALL, but I suffer from a major disability: I have never studied Roman history at all. Therefore, while I know some names, I don't have a sharp understanding of the time periods under consideration.In reading Gibbon, I have been keeping this volume by my side, and it has been more useful than I had possibly imagined that it would be. I haven't gotten into the later periods that Gibbon covers, but at least on the earlier periods of the Roman Empire, this dictionary has had entries on nearly everything that I have wanted to look up.I highly recommend it."
1,Product was DOA,"The product was dead on arrival -- it doesn't seem to be built very well, so I returned it and bought Ectaco's dictionaries for the Palm platform. They work very well although they do take up quite a bit of memory."
1,Awful and company stinks,"This unit may have good information in it, but is built VERY poorly. Died in less than a year!!! Company says too bad. NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!!! Find another translator company."
1,Save your money,"It arrived when expected. It's a nice size and light weight. That's where ""nice"" ends. I'm taking a trip to Russia in a few weeks and thought this would really be of help. Well, it isn't. Yes, it does translate from English to Russian but NOT into phonetically spelled words. It translates into Russian using the Russian alphabet. If I could read the alphabet, I wouldn't need the translator. Next, the screen is very difficult to read under any lighting conditions. So, what I have is an expensive currency converter with a bad screen. A $5 calculator would serve a better purpose. When I complained to the company, their response was for me to buy a translator from them priced over $400. Somehow, I don't think so."
2,What 5 other languages does it translate????,How can I buy a translator if I do not know all of the languages they do. If I want more than what is advertised how can I tell this product is what I want without knowing all languages????
5,Our roadmap to save our world,"If you're serious about making a difference in the world and in YOUR own world, this book is for you. God has laid out a plan of attack for us to take back what the devil stole. Rebecca O. does a great job of teaching, inspiring and challenging all of us to go to the next level and really live an abundant life filled with prayer, hope, love and peace. God ordained and I recommend this book to all women of color and others too! There are scriptures in the back for daily reading...I love it. It changed my life!"
1,Received lowest review score of any player on CNET,"This player is so bad that the internet's biggest gadget reviewer, CNET, had a segment called ""prizefight"" where they compared this device to a homemade mp3 player. It was a tie.Check out the review: http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/coby-mp-c7082-1gb/4505-6490_7-32401479.html?tag=txt;pageTo top off all of the incredibly dumb design features and quirks, this thing has a 2.5mm headphone jack instead of a 3.5mm jack, meaning that you will need a special adapter in order to use any normal pair of headphones.To quote CNET ""It is a rare day indeed we come across a piece of technology that so utterly fails at its intended purpose, but American electronics manufacturer Coby has managed to produce just such a device: the Coby MP-C7000 series MP3 player.""http://cnettv.cnet.com/2001-1_53-28113.html"
1,Crap!,This MP3 player is the biggest joke ever. I bought it as a Christmas present for my little sister. When I tried to charge it for her it won't charge. It has been on the charger for 10 hours and nothing has happened..
2,Poor,Ok i had this thing for all of 1 week and i liked it for a few days but then the earphone port broke and i was a little pissed so i tried to return it and no one contacted me so 1 thing after another the battery started acting up it would turn on and turn off i give this thing a 2 outta 10 dont buy it at all costumer service is really poor
1,What a $ Loss,I ordered two of these. One for my son and one for myself. They both died days apart/would not charge. I am disappointing beyond words. This was my very first MP3 player. I was really enjoying the convenience. I was about to download books.My son needed it as part of is recovery therapy. Now we are afraid to get another that is as en-expensive.(17$ each.
1,Cheap is not always better,This is not a very good mp3 player at all. It is only allowing me to sync 2 songs at a time. Waste of money.
1,white mp3 player,"I bought these mp3 players for my boys. I got them for Christmas and the day we pulled it out. To charge and down load songs to. It wouldn't keep a charge. Now we are trying the 2nd one, we are hopping it will charge."
2,you get what you pay for,"bought three of these cheap on Amazon.one never worked. the other two died slowly. good fun while they lasted, really just a waste of money."
1,NOT SATISFIED,"THE SELLER'S SERVICE WAS GREAT BUT THE EQUIPMENT LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED. SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT, RECEPTION AND STORAGE ARE GOOD BUT ONCE THE BATTERY DIES, IT WILL NOT RECHARGE. THE BATTERY IS INTERNAL SO IT CAN NOT BE REPLACED. THIS IS MY SECOND ONE, FIRST ONE SAME PROBLEM AND WAS REPLACED BY SELLER."
1,Disappointed,This Mp3 player hasn't worked since it first arrived in my house. The charger that was sent with it would not charge the device. My kids were very disappointed on christmas day. I would not recommend anyone to spend their money on this.
2,it ok,but there is a problem sometimes with the battery charging and it take so long for the battery to charger but other than that it ok for the price i payed for it. it better than the mp4 player that i payed 45 bucks
1,Piece of Crap - DO NOT BUY,First time I used it I charged it as directed - didn't work. I left it charging much longer and finally got it to hold a partial charge for a few days. Then it died and will not charge at all now. Just past the 30 day return policy for amazon...it's a piece of crap and not worth even the shipping amount. DO NOT BUY IT. Not even good as a toy for kids. I'm very disappointed.
2,Coby MP3 Player - sync process unclear,"The demo tunes work fine. However, after 1 week of working withthe player, I am still unable to get a clean load.The player requires Win Media Play 11. I was able to upgradeand found that it now sees the player but complains aboutspace on the device and will not load the playlist. It doesnot allow for straight copying of the tunes.The controls are simple but still confusing as to moving aroundthe menus. I continually find that I have to back out andstart over and walk back through the menu to get to thefunction that I am looking for."
3,Get what you pay for,"For less than ten bucks, you have a functional 1 gig MP3 player. Not the greatest construction or software, but you get what you pay for. If you need a player that's disposable or expendible, it's worth the price."
1,price,3 days ago the price for this item was 8.40$ and now is 30$.But it 's very expensive for 1 GB player/
1,This MP3 SUCKS!!!!,"I bought like a week ago and seriously Amzon needs 2 STOP selling stuff like this but I still love Amazon it's not thier fault. Anyways had it for a week and I charged it on my computer,put some songs on it,was jammin' in my car and then the battery was dying soooooooo I plugged it in for 2 days now it has been charging but it will NOT hold a charge no matter what I do. I have tried 2 reset it and everything this MP3 player SUCKS do not buy anything from COBY believe me if you do you will be MAD. The only reason I'm not really pissed is because I bought it for 8.23 I believe or close to it so it would cost me more just 2 ship it back so it's cool I will just have 2 buy an iPod now since I KNOW they work well....REMEMBER DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY PRODUCT FROM COBY YOU WILL REGRET IT. I wish I would of read the reviews BEFORE I bought this....Melani"
3,Incomplete,"I was especially interested in getting some info on some Gibson archtops I own,from the 30's and 40's, so I bought this book.The book inexplicably gives zero information about any acoustic archtops made prior to 1948,despite it's title of: 'Gibson Shipment Totals 1937 - 1979'.I tracked down the website of the author, to ask about this...but it's been a few weeks now with no response.I knew that I was only getting 60 pages for my $20...but I expected to at least get what was advertised."
3,Can a shipment total reference make facinating reading?,"In the case of Larry Meiners new book, the answer is clearly yes. Being a casual gibson collector, I've been startled by how many times I've grabbed this wonderfull little book off the shelf. Clearly formated so the information you want is instantly available, if you have ever wondered how rare your Les Paul is, or when they started making that J-45 you love, this book is for you."
3,Camera Good-Nikon Service is terrible,Obviously from the other reviews the camera is fine. The problem is if you have a problem with it. My auto-focus gave out about a week after the warrant ended. I was charged $775.00 to repair it. Nikon kept it for 38 days. Sent it back and never reapaired the problem.They took it back worked on it for a week- waived the $293.00 charge. Guess what? I am on holsd with the service department as it was sent back with the same problem.Speaking of service forget about ever speaking to a real person unless you have 2-4 hours to kill.never again .
5,Having fun,"Ever since I purchased this camera, I feel that I can now show my full potential as a photographer.The cameras images are sharp and detailed. Changing shutter speeds and the aperture is a piece of cake for adjusting to light.It's not too heavy, but it takes a few days to get used to how the camera functions and the settings.after you get past that, it is a superb device."
5,nice camera,"got it fast, very happy with it , we don t use it as much as would like, but over all very happy"
3,Okay but not an Oscar candidate.,"Probably more interesting if you have actually been to or worked in Frankfurt. Unusual as you actually get to see inside Supreme Allied HQ, later V Corps HQ in Frankfurt now part of the University of Frankfurt (the former IG Farben Headquarters, where, among other things, Cyklon B poison gas used in the concentration camps was developed). Not particularly a bad film, but there are better."
5,it is a classic,I was in vegas and I was losing and decided to watch tv instead \. And I have seen it and it is in colorized version. IT IA AN EPIC and a classic.
4,Don't be afraid of the So. Korea label,"It's nice someone is making this movie available on DVD. It was getting hard to find with most copies on new ($$$) or used VHS tapes. This is a fresh and official (not pirated) copy of the movie. The Korean subtitles can be turned off and the soundtrack is the original English.This is the first Joan of Arc movie I ever saw. A couple of new ones were made in 1999 and have better effects and battle scenes, but I've noticed they both borrow a bit from this original version, in particularly the ""good soldier"" from Joan's inner circle who looks like a wall and has the same character, as well as her regrets over the post battle carnage."
1,Stunningly Hollywood,"This movie should have won an award for being the most anticeptic and historically false presentation of an historical figure in the history of Hollywood. One step away from being a cartoon everyone in peace or war wears clean and neatly pressed clothing, has impeccably brushed hair and remarkably clean faces, and travels over an unruly nature that looks suspiciously like a well tended Zen garden.For intelligent and convincing drama about Joan of Arc look elsewhere! This one will make even the few Catholics left in church head for the doors!Much wasted talent and, I seem to recall, an ill-timed career venture for Ingrid Bergman, one of my four favorite actresses, who was involved in a sex scandal at or near the time this movie was made."
3,Sanitised version of Joan's story,"They have a way in this movie of making 15th century Europe look a lot less bloody, sexist, lusting, and filthy than it really was. Nonetheless, already having known a lot of the real Joan's life I found this film to be reasonably accurate and it goes down seriously but still easily enough. Recommended!"
1,ward bond in this movie really stinks,"it's just like they putting in the ""duke"" in the movie ""the greatest story ever told""and in his voice lol, truly he is the son of kong mean god. now they go and put ward bond who is in wagon train is beyond me.only just my opinion."
1,a 35 year old swede plays an insipid little 17 year old frenchie: quelle masterpiece!,"ingrid bergman was way too old and way too pretty for this part, but they figured they had a smash hit, i guess. the tale of the late medieval schizophrenic girl who somehow won a couple of battles (amazing what group psychosis can do, isnt it?) is told here in full pomp and splendor, but everything -- even jose ferrer in the seemingly unmessable up part of the dauphin -- falls flat. the most overrated woman in history seems to get bad movies made about her life regularly, and while this isnt as abominable as jean seberg & otto ""premature"" violating bernard shaw a decade later, its pretty bad."
4,value for your money,"For the price paid, this is an excellent product. Easy to use with a clear, sharp picture. The set-up was easy including the use of the remote. I would highly recommend the product for an inexpensive purchase. A geat buy for the price with good quality."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this television just under year ago. For the first few months it worked great, but the picture started to go down hill after the first 4 months or so. A few weeks ago the set just died on me....it wasn't even a year old and didn't even receive particulary heavy use! I would advise anyone who is buying this set to purchase an extended warrenty, because this is a television set where the phrase ""you get what you pay for"" definatly applies."
2,"Works great, and then...","I got it on January 3, 2001. I set it up, and it worked great, sharp picture, good sound, and now here I am on January 30, getting ready to return it, because last night, as I was watching it, it suddenly shut off. I can't get it to turn back on, so my advice to you is, be careful when you decide to buy it..."
4,Aaaaaargh,"Last week i was on holiday in New Zealand and i saw this double cd in a shop in Christchurch for about 11$. And stupid me didn't buy it. Aaaargh ! Original album is a real grower, after owning it for months i still grow more fond of it."
3,Pretty Good,"Comfortable walking shoe for short distances. Fits good. Not a lot of support (which is understandable). A very ugly shoe in the picture and even worse in person. Can't speak for its durability yet, but seems fairly solid."
5,Definitely buy this!,"This is a great CD. The new one with Wino (""With Vision"") is even better. I think Place of Skulls is even much better than Pentagram. The guy that said ""more of a tube sound is needed"" doesn't know what he is talking about. I have seen Victor's amps and they are indeed tube. I haven't heard metal this good since early Trouble."
1,Not good,"Paper falls off after a few minutes of use, then cant be re-attached. I want a paper that comes off when I take it off, not whenever it feels like it..Stick to Norton."
4,December 7th The Movie,Acclaimed feature-length dramatization of the administrative mishaps which precipitated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Banned by the U.S. government for its criticism of Army policy and its alleged anti-Americanism.
3,Its just OK.. for the price I should have purchased a plank,"Sure, this will spread wider than your average plank, but when extended it does sag a little, and when extended you only have half as many bars under your feet so it feels a little less stable.I love my 10126 Wing ladder, but this accessory doesn't get used much. I just move the ladder around more instead."
5,Perfect for what I use it for. Installing crown in small kitchens.,I have been needing a small expandable plank. This plank has worked very nicely for installing mouling in combination with the little giant ladder. I love it.
1,"Unless you push very carefully, the staples fail to close.","I've struggled with this stapler in the years since I bought it. Unless I am very very careful to avoid any side to side wiggle when stapling, or or the other end of the staple does not fold over properly.This is a flimsy stapler that does not work properly. I've tried more than one brand of staples, that's not the problem."
3,"Good book, not so good translation","Evidently, the Nibelungenlied is a great treasure, a wonderful epic, but this particular translation is not great, nor are Hatto's notes too elaborate or even useful."
3,ENGL 221 -- World Literature,"The Nibelungenlied was one of many epics assigned for my World Literature class. It is a German war epic thought to be written in the 13th century although its author is unknown. I haven't read any other translations of this epic poem but A.T. Hatto's prose translation kept me interested throughout the entire story with a good balance of dialogue and action. This story of rivalry and love contains many twists and turns, none of which I want to mention for fear of giving away too much, but I will say it is a story that will surprise you with each new page. What I found particularly helpful with this Penguins Classics edition is The Glossary of Characters' Names located in the back of book."
3,An Insider Views the Carter Presidency,"Peter Bourne, a somewhat unknown member of the Carter White House, has written a relatively balanced biography of our 39th President. He admits his flaws (extreme stubborness and lack of political saavy), while stressing the religious values by which he tried to steer the country. His ""spokes of a wheel"" idea for running the executive branch, opposed by just about everyone who knew anything about the way the White House should be run, is an example of his flaws. His loyalty to the Middle East Peace process is an example of his values taking precedence over domestic political concerns.Bourne, occasionally wears Carter ""blinders"" (as when he excuses the president's lack of knowledge of his brother's dealings with Libyan oil interests or when he attributes the failure of the hostage rescue mission solely to ""bad luck and military ineptitude""), yet, on the whole, this is a worthwhile effort at detailing the man without the myth."
4,A Comprehensive Book,"I'm a Republican who nevertheless admired Jimmy Carter greatly, and I am saddened by his recent petulant rants agains President George W. Bush. He has every right to diagree with him but succumbing to the conspiracy theories of the wacko left is unseemly for a former President. Bourne needs to write a sequel."
1,useless item,"had a hard time using this thing. first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip, then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt. I went back to using my tie bar and tack."
3,tie holder,"It is pretty good, except it is a little tight and hard to clip it to my shirts.If you get it on right, it will hold your tie in place."
1,Imagine language without plurals,"ECTACO English <-> German Language Teacher - EGm600TThis electronic dictionary may have almost a half million entries but you better be prepared for a world with just one of each item. This dictionary does not include the plural form of nouns in either language. Because of this huge shortcoming, I wouldn't pay 1/10 the price for this model or any other electronic dictionary that doesn't include the plural form. Imagine not being able to know that the plural of child is children or the plural of die Zeitung (newspaper) is die Zeitungen. I'm also less than happy that this fact isn't pointed in the product description. When I contacted the folks at Ectaco, they referred to it as an option. I don't agree. It is an essential feature that has been left out and serverely limits the usefulness of the product.My product was returned the next business day."
1,just plain bad....,"i'm sorry, but this book doesn't show much of any sort of depth of knowledge. instead, it ignores the main sources of power and tries to portray it as an external style that uses clever body mechanics to get the job done. to me, this is just another way for people to be warded away from the reality of the internal styles. maybe instead of analyzing the postures and talking about momentum, he should show the isometric standing chi kung that gives the practitioner raw internal strength, and talk about how the five elements and twelve animals each have a different way of generating chi. this book is a good example of a typical western perspective of ignoring the depth of the art and thinking that everything can be explained through efficient body movement (much in the same way that most tai chi chuan practitioners think that tai chi chuan is just a gentle exercise for old people)."
1,Oh Dear!,"The title says it all really!""Untraditional Hsing-i""! is exactly what this book describes.Not only is it un-traditional it is un-authentic, & incorrect in so many ways that it would be impossible to list them.This is exactly the problem with so many people in the west, where they do not understand the principles of an asian art, so they bastardise it and drop all the important and significant aspects that actually make the art what it is, resulting in a very and in this case I do mean Very poor shadow of the real thing.I'm truly frightened that this person Robb Whitewood has the nerve to claim 1. to be a master of anything, and 2. to be qualified to teach this art.An appalling book.Sorry but that is the truth. The only reason it gets 1 star is that there is not an option for zero."
4,nice book shame about the price,Kluwer seem to have done it again...produced a reasonable book that would be of value to many physicians but sadly way over priced and simply not worth the outlay in hard earned cash...of course they say it's because of the 'high cost of publishing' somehow I find that rather hard to believe. Buy this if money is not important to you.
5,Dancin' On The Smooth Edge!,"Every time I ask someone if they ever heard of the song the answer is always ""NO"". Oh My Goodness!!! That song has to be one of Whitney's best songs ever!!! I mean it's a mystery why it's so hard to find! The last time I heard the song was probably on the radio back in 2002. I've seen song lyrics online but for the life of me I can't even remember how the tune went!!!! MAN!I wonder why this song has never been on any ""Greatest Hits"" albums. This song must be extremely exclusive for Amazon not to have a mp3 sample of the song for us to preview."
5,An 18 year fan of Mr. AL's musical magic in motion!,"I have been a fan of Mr. Al's music for most of my career in early childhood education. My own children grew up learning pre school concepts through his music as well. I now live on the other side of the United States, working with after school age kids. This age group is equally enthralled! Math in motion is also a great teaching and homework tool with this age group. We are introducing Mr. Al to the pacific northwest, ""AL a carte""and they love him!"
5,Great Resource,"I bought this for the song ""Clean up Time"" but there is so much more to it than that! I love Mr. Al and I use several of his CD's throughout the day!"
5,An excellent vision for America,"Gary Hart's proposals for America's ""large purposes"" for the 21st century should find support from both the left and the right. While he makes it abundantly clear that he does not support the current administration's actions, his proposals and and worldview can be satisfying to Democrats and Republicans, at least if they are not too close to the fringes. This is a book about ideas, not a compilation of proposed programs, so it can be argued that it is naive. Hart does provide some examples of how the ideas might be implemented in practice, but there is clearly much more work to be done. Since such work should be done on a bipartisan basis, I believe he was correct in keeping the book short (and even repetitive, as it was) and concentrating on grand strategy. In summary, I found the book inspiring during a time when there is so much partisan bickering. I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see how we can move forward in America united, not divided."
2,First one arrived broken,The first one arrived broken and the company did replace it butas this was for an ailing relative I had to buy one locally fromthe medical supply store for a LOT more than this one cost.I did have a chance to look this one over before I sent it back.It's smaller than I thought and is suitable for a meal or magazines.It is not like the industral strength ones at the medical supply storethat supplies the local hospital.That said it doesn't cost anywhere near as much either.
1,Missing Casters,I like the table but there were no casters or instructions with it. I had to buy some casters and figure out how to put it together.
3,Poor Instruction for assembly,"The instructions are not clear / wrong. They give the wrong bolt size, and the picture is not clear. At the end you have to take out the black bolt so the table will come up. This is not mentioned in the instructions, under the table top. Also, they have some silver cylinders that go on the side in the sleve with the locked rollers, which is not clear. We had to take the table apart 2-3 times to get it to work. The table, once assembled, is a good unit. Put we tore the conner putting it together, due to poor instructions. Once you put it together the next time is a snap, but the instructions if followed will create problens for you. The small bolts are used first, not the big ones that go in the base that the instructions tell you to use. Turn the tabel on its side to insert the handle. Delivery was good and fast.Good luck."
4,Good portable surface,"This went together easily, looks good and rolls well. So useful! I took away one star because the base on the one I received is a different style than the one pictured."
4,What Do You Expect For the Price?,"Granted the S2 is not built like a tank. It was not billed as such and I suggest that anyone who thinks they need that, chili out the $4.5 K for the D1x or $7 K for the 1Ds.I purchased mine to be housed for undewater shooting. I have shot mostly macro to this point but will now be shooting WA as well. The color saturation and TTL are incredible and equal in quality to my previous N90s/Provia 100 setup. The S2 is the only camera on the market where the TTL is compatable with underwater strobes. You can see some of my underwater photos at http://scottyb.home.texas.net/Gallery/ .I have used it extensively top side as well. You can purchase 24 2000 MA AA's for less than $30. I have also purchase the lithiums online 24/$30. This makes this setup very inexpensive and convenient to power. Plus you can purchase AA alkalines anywhere to get you out of a pinch.A 1 GB Compactflash card for under $300 will hold 78 shots in RAW at the highest resolution."
1,Fuji S2 Fails,"I have a Fuji S2 which I bought on July 15th, 2003. The main logic board failed the first week of Jan. 04Jack Appletonjack.appleton@msa.hinet.net"
3,So-so camera,Fuji's s2 is just so-so compared with NIkon and Canon.The imag is soft and color is not right 8 out of 10.will buy 20d
2,dissapointed with this program,"I bougth this program trying to make funny templates and it really can do it, it has a lot of combinations that make you smile but the big problem that I saw is the quality at the time you printed, you can't print photos larger the 1/4 letter size because you will see a lot of distortion on it."
4,Best New York Sleaze and Roll,"The Raunch Hands were THE band in the late 80s , and one of the first to mix blues, punk, surf, garage, and black R&B. Mike Mariconda, the guitar player, is known for producing lots of great bands for Crypt Records, but he is at his best on stage. This is a good document of a 90s reunion show, with Mike Edison, who also leads the Edison Rocket Train, on drums.... this is good fun, but check out their studio records, these guys were GREAT."
4,Well made documentary,This was well made. If you are a teacher know that it has LOTS of pictures of naked starving children alive and dead. It really gets across how desperate the people were. It focused on Hoover and how he really disliked Communism but wanted to help the people. It shows how he sold this aid program in Congress in America as something that might show Russian people American efficiency and other virtues through running the program (which they hoped would make them to want a new government.)
4,Good for toddlers,Love these they are east for my toddler to use and she loves to color on her chalk board with these. However she did figure out pretty quickly how to take the chalk out of the holder.
2,Easily broke,I took issue with the handle container; the chalk falls out of it very easily. Putting it back in does not solve the problem but actually aggravates it because it shaves off even more chalk which reduces the circumference of the chalk and the handles ability to grip the base.
4,Great for roofers,I sell Roofing replacement after storm damage and use the chalk holders to keep from getting chalk all over my hands.I mark the damage and take photos to show the customer what I have found.
4,New spin to consider,"Having read so many books on JFK's assassination, it's easy to get excited about a new look at something that isn't covered anywhere else. The Second Plot gives a new possibility to considering all of those 'fake' Oswalds showing up to make LHO look like a Castro lover and probable killer of JFK. After reading this book, I feel more solid in my belief that Oswald was an agent of our CIA that got handled by a rogue element within...LHO's blind following of his handlers got him set up as the fall guy. The easy understanding of the government coverup is now simple to see ... we had to avoid an invasion or attack of Cuba to avoid World War 3...had LHO made it to his scheduled plane to infiltrate Cuba and evidence led back to Castro killing JFK....we'd all be dust."
3,BE Ware the subtitles,"I had high expectations for this, except it was very difficult to understand. The English subtitles are almost impossible to read. Imagine 'white' on some light color like white or cream.CRITERION has always meant Quality, not this time.Work the subtitles into legibility and you have an excellent film."
2,disappointed in the song choices,"did not like the songs chosen...would have liked to hear more of the Elvis old songs. He has an incredible voice, however."
5,"Uh Hu, Oh yah yah!","Thank you very much, it was, I mean you know, it was very good and I got along well with it, and it was a great tribute."
5,Wonderful,"Love this frangrance. I used it every day and enjoyed the way my car smelled my bedroom. It was such a wonderful fragrance.Please note the top of the bottle broke on mine, so I couldn't take it on vacation because I didn't have a lid, but that was the only thing that happened with the product."
2,Mesh vest,"Ordered the wrong item. I thought I was ordering reflective tape that I could put on my life vests. Should have read more carefully. Probably good for its set purpose, but I didn't read closely enough, since it was combined with other kinds of tape. Ate the loss! Probably can find a friend to give it to."
5,Delightful music for babies and grandparents,"Each song is a musical work of art. Familiar songs such as ""Summertime"" and ""Rock-a-Bye, Baby"" sound fresh with new harmonies and a variety of accompanying instruments. The unfamiliar songs (some in other languages) are eqally high quality. Susie's lovely voice is warm and comforting. This is one ""children's"" CD that does not get annoying with repetition. My one-year-old grandson and I enjoy this soothing CD daily."
5,Lullabies,I bought this for my Granddaughter when she was an infant. She is now 3 yrs. old and it is still what she listens to each night at bedtime. It is soothing for all!
5,Great Gifts!!!,I can't tell you what a relief it was to discover such a talented and gifted children's music artist as Susie Tallman. I've played other cd's for my children and they just don't respond the same way they do when I play her music. It's hilarious watching their little heads bob up and down as they belt out one of her songs. I have all her cd's and I love sending them as gifts!
3,Great but with a couple of short commings,"Gun case is well made and fits 30 inch barrel very well. Case could be improved with a pocket for storing choke tubes, wrench etc. The leather sling is too short for convienent carrying over the shoulder and non-adjustable."
2,NO! They ruined it!,"Redshift 3 was, hands down, the you-know-what in this software category. It was near-perfection! They have brought it down to the garden variety of its competitors. I will stay with Redshift 3!BTW, I am a PhD in astronomy, so if I seem upset, please see the other posts. I am not alone. This is its competitor with the little squeaky hand, not the great Redshift we have come to know and love.Navigation is terrible, and frames change settings with views. I am going to be ill. Excuse me. Nooooo!"
2,Red Shift 4,I recieved Red Shift 4 via UPS today. I have found it not up to the ease of use as Red Shift 3 which was top notch. Red Shift 4 is a big let down. I sure would like to return it and just keep my old Red Shift 3.
5,But where's the rainbow?,"I heard ""A Rainbow in Curved Air"" on a late-nite radio station while traveling in Europe in 1973. As soon as I could, I looked up this unknown artist (to me) in the Schwann music catalog. There I found ""in C"" and ""A Rainbow in Curved Air"". I bought them both. While ""In C"" is quite good, I am partial to ""A Rainbow in Curved Air"", which is why I'm so surprised that it is apparently no longer available. Maybe I have weird taste?Anyway, if you like Terry's ""In C"", try to find a copy of his follow-up ""A Rainbow in Curved Air"". You'll be in for a treat."
3,satisfactory,"cups are small and the printing is not very precise, but well packed and arrived in good shape, nice product for the price"
5,Very Pleased and Happy,I really am pleased with my purchase of the Little Tea Cups. They are just the right size and they go so well with my Tea-Pot. I would order them again!!
5,This fine book wins star listing on Combatantbooks.com.,"Our reviewers are Vietnam veterans, and our goal is to provide readers a list of what we believe to be Best Books on the Vietnam War. We give it a Star Rating, best of the best. Col (Ret) William C. Haponski"
5,Unchained Eagle,"An inspiration autobiography that takes the reader from a young man's journey in Vietnam, from a B52 to to the Hanoi Hilton. It is a journey of faith and conflict. Rev Certain's story is one of quiet determination. It is a quick read and a look back at a time when America was conflicted by a war that changed the country and the lives of many of the participants-certainly that of Robert Certain."
5,Great book of fun neuroscience.,"This is a neat collection of various defects people can develop as a result of a local stroke. Through the book is a (thoroughly believable) argument that our brain is modular: cognitive defects are highly specific to the area brain damage occurs. There is no ""central processing"" where consciousness occurs - but instead it's all spread out through the brain. This is better than ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" as it's more science-y, but gives you similar fascinating examples of defects.I highly recommend this book."
3,Doctor Who???????,"To save confusion, it's best to view the Doctor as a completely different, parallel universe Doctor instead of trying to place an already established Doctor in it. Lance Parkin has done a wonderful job in recreating Gallifrey, it's history and the fact that there are others living on the planet and not just the TimeLords. How could you not have a 35th Anniversary book without the potential grand destruction of the entire universe. This book is recommended for a change from the normal Doctor's exploits as I find alternate versions are always refreshing. Only probelme is that I found the Doctor's portrayal to be a little bland, but with everything else going on, with the mediation between Sontaran and Rutan factions and the return of a historical Gallifreyan hero, this hardly really mattered.An enjoyable read - RECOMMENDED!!!"
1,The Infinity Doctors (Doctor Who series),"It stinks. Long winded, boring, and a total waste of time. Parkin decided he didn't want to do a real Doctor Who story so he wrote this instead. Call it Doctor Who so I can sell it."
5,A Yankee Doodle Dandy of a Bio!,"Seen the Movies? Read this book!A great bio of one of Filmdom's Gods.You will learn alot about the man as actor, and human being, and about Hollywood in the Golden Age here.Like many Leading Men of the Golden Age there was a lot of There THERE in that pretty little head of his, in the performance of his craft, and in his personal life, and we are fortunate to have had him performing on screen into is old age.Fantastic!"
5,Cagney,Excellent BIO learned things about Cagney that I didn't know and found the book very interesting and insightful into the man. A very enjoyable read would recommend to anyone wanting to understand the Great Actor.
3,Wish I Knew,This product is OK. However charging in a car is not really convienent. Also it is discontinued by manufacturer good luck getting parts. A home charger would be great. save your money and buy one that just uses batteries
1,rechargeable flashlight,Bad experience with product. The charge light would show fully charged when first plugged into outlet. Light would never turn on.
2,Dark future for a bright product,"I was very disappointed with this lantern. I was looking for a bright handy flashlight that was rechargeable. No easy task.There are not many on the market to choose from.The ""Built in AC Charger"" is a plug that sticks out of one end of the unit. It took a few tries, but eventually I found an extension cord that fit on the unit so I could charge it.The unit is bulky, the on/off switch is not intuitive or sensible.I gave it 2 stars because, well, the light is nice...."
2,modern parents,"The book is full of good intensions, but is not based on the reality that mothers work and fathers have more active roles than they did in the 70s/80s. I also expected to have updated research added to this new edition, most of references are from at least 10 years old."
1,Even family bedders can have sleep problems,"Another reviewer mentioned that this book might be best for parents of newborns, not older infants. I have to agree. I picked it up when we started having lots of night time problems with our daughter, who slept in our bed. It outlines various problems, and the answer to each problem is: let your kid sleep in bed with you. Well, what if you are doing that, and you still have problems, like a child who wakes up several times crying, or who moans all night in her sleep, or who kicks and pushes mom all night long? I like the idea of family bedding, but it is NOT the cure-all that this book would have you believe. My child does not wake up happy just because she is in our bed, in fact, she often still wakes up crying. But there do not seem to be any books out there that actually address sleep problems for family bedders. Ferber's book was revolting; Sears' was a disappointment, with no real answers to sleep problems."
1,Supports the CO not the SLEEP!,"I am so glad I read this book because it helps me feel OK about our family bed. HOWEVER I was hoping for some ways to get our baby to sleep better but solutions are sorely lacking. For those I found another Sear's recommendation: The No-Cry Sleep Solution, which supports cosleeping but also offers ways for everyone to get better sleep. If you want your family bed validated this is a great book."
3,"A good, not great book on nighttime baby issues","While William Sears is probably one of the best authorities on modern parenting, this book skims the surface of nighttime sleep issues. The problems are addressed too broadly and hence the book is only useful as a general guide with no specific courses of action or recommendations. The definitive book on nighttime sleep issues has yet to be written, and until it is, this will have to do"
4,Great book if you are a breastfeeding mother!,"This book is a great read if you breastfeed. You can learn a few things from it. Above all, this book teaches you how to be a better parent and better understand your child's needs. Highly recommend it!"
4,Good book for breastfeeding Moms,"This is a good book, but is written mainly for breastfeeding Mom's. If you're not breastfeeding, there is still some good information, but you'll have to wade through each chapter. If you are breastfeeding and you are condsidering having your child sleep in your room or in your bed, this book is excellent. Dr. Sears is kind, condsiderate and humorous at times. If however, you would prefer that your child sleep in their own room, you will probably get more out of Dr. Ferber's book - Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems. I bought both to compare approachs. You might benefit from the same strategy."
1,Read only if you plan to co-sleep with your baby,"I am a tremendous fan of Dr. Sears and own several of his books, but this one is completely off-base. His best (and only) advice is to share the family bed, which is not an option for us since we own a waterbed. I had hoped to find some helpful information to apply to crib sleeping, especially since our baby had colic for four months. Unfortunately, Dr. Sears' only recommendation was to share the bed. Again, his other books are fine, but this one has only one advice line."
3,Controversial--worth reading but a false rosy picture,"I'll avoid getting into the debate about whether co-sleeping is better or worse than cribbing it--I suggest parents make up their own minds and not feel defensive about it--but as someone who co-slept with baby for seven months I can tell you Dr. Sears is off his rocker when he says Mom sleeps better when baby's in the bed. No, Mom sleeps better when baby sleeps for a nice long stretch. In the bed, baby knows that Mom's All Night Snack Bar is open and will wake you every hour or two, which turned me into a cranky zombie. Thank goodness my son's transition to crib hasn't been too much of a battle (a couple weeks of him crying for 10 minutes and us caving in before he started sleeping through), but this cozy, everybody's-happy picture of co-sleeping is definitely not true for some of us."
4,Kind but too unstructured,"I liked that Sears supports nurturing and loving the baby rather than letting him cry it out as many books advocate, but I found that we needed some more structure in order to get our baby to fall asleep on his own and take proper naps. I liked the Baby Whisperer book and Dr. Weissbluth's book. Though I don't follow either to the letter, they enabled me to come up with a plan that got our baby to sleep through the night (and take great naps) without resorting to letting the baby cry it out."
3,Not helpful unless you are breastfeeding,"This book is helpful for breastfeeding moms, but if you want to do attachment parenting and for whatever reason are not breastfeeding, this book will probably be a big disappointment. The two main suggestions are that you nurse your baby to soothe him/her and you let him/her sleep in your bed. So if you are formula feeding, you probably will find this book not full of solutions for you.Dr. Sears, please note that not every mother is a birth mother and not every mother has a baby that is able to breastfeed and not every mother breastfeeds, but those mothers still love their babies and want them to have peaceful sleep."
2,Not a good choice for parents looking to solve sleep problem,"My husband and I purchased this book in the hopes that it would give us ideas on how to get our daughter to go to sleep. After moving our 6 month old could not get settled in to a routine. Before we moved she slept in her own bed, so we were looking for alternative ways to get her to go to sleep again on her own. This book was a huge disappointment because it made me feel guilty for even trying to get her to sleep in her own bed. This is a very unrealistic approach to night time parenting."
1,Do we need more guilt?,"Dr. Sears tells us society makes us feel guilty if we do co-sleep, but he just makes us feel guilty if we dont. Very little of the articles quoted are recent. He gives very few practical tips besides put the kids in bed with you. The entire book pretty much assumes that mom's do not work, and when they do they never work at night! Let's find a book that offers helpful advice, not just pat the back of those who have easy enough lives to rearrange our entire lives to the whims of our children."
3,"Dr Sears, I love you but....","I followed your advice and co-slept, breastfed and carried my baby in her sling. And now she's almost a year old and still waking up every hour or two all night - every night. While I love the concepts contained here, this book made me feel guilty for wanting more sleep. I love my baby, but I need some sleep, too. I found a book that Dr. Sears recommends called The No Cry Sleep Solution that takes the same compassionate, caring attitude, but adds actual solutions to help my baby sleep better. She's already sleeping 6 straight hours and I feel like a new woman!"
2,"Good Advice for ""Easy"" Babies Only","I own eight books by Sears and this is the only one I would not highly recommend. There isn't much in here that isn't in The Baby Book, though it goes into slightly greater detail in some areas. It is lacking in good techniques that work for babies age 9 months to 18 months unless they are very ""easy"" children. If you have an easy or average baby it is a quick read and might be worth the time if you know little or nothing about normal infant sleep. If you have a child with a challenging temperment don't even bother."
3,Wonderful book,"Needs updating, at least the copy I got did. It still said that it was allowable for baby to sleep on her side, which the APA has said is not the case. Keep newer findings in mind when reading this book, and you can get some good information."
5,"A little pricey, but cheaper than a fall","I do not have a Little Giant Ladder system. I have the Gorilla Ladders sold at Home Depot. These are a little cheaper and not quite a nice as Little Giant. However, this leveler works great with them. The locking screw adds a little to the width of the ladder, but it isn't a large inconvenience. It can be left on the ladder, even retracted above the original foot. This is nice. Otherwise, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to find the ladder and leveler, when I needed them.I have been building a large shed on about a 20 degree slope. Before I ordered this leveler, I seem to be always putting blocks or boards under one of more ladder legs. Now, it takes about 10 seconds to drop the leveler down to the right setting. There are times where having two would be nice, such as setting up the step ladder on a slight slope, with the V of the step ladder along the hill.I also had no problems with this third party vendor."
5,Fits Cosco worlds greatest ladder also.,I bought the little giant leg leveler for my Cosco worlds greatest ladder that is sold at Menards. I could not find any info on the internet if this leveler fits other brands of ladders. Since this ladder suppose to be a clone of the little giant ladder I bought the leveler to see if it fits. The leveler fits good like it was made for this ladder also. Easy to install and adjust the height.
3,Does Not work on typical staircase (very misleading),"The flared bottom of the ladder, plus mounting leveler on the outsideOf the leg creates such a wide spread it misses the next step, andDoes not extend downward enough to catch the proceeding one.Notice how there pictures & videos never demonstrate it on multiple steps.VERY DECEPTIVE L.G."
1,Poor Design,This product simply does not work! I'm confused how there are any good reviews for it on amazon because it honesty is horribly designed and is not very functional ether.
1,Broke After 6 months,Jerry Lundegarde's post below matches my experience. These things get very hot even with display illumination turned all the way down.
2,Power jack in unit wore out just after warranty expired,The first unit I purchased lasted a week or two until it got a dark blotch on the display. I received a new unit with no problem from Radio Shack. The current unit was awesome until just after the warranty expired. Apparently the power input jack is not very durable and now makes poor contact. When I hit a bump or touch the unit it turns off and back on. I didn't buy the life time subscription plan for the simple fact that I didn't know how long the unit would last. Now I'm really glad I didn't. I would have had to buy a new unit and then pay Sirius $75 in order to keep the life time plan going. It's just a big crap shoot as to how long a unit will last.
1,Do not buy this radio,"Do not buy this receiver. This model was redesigned to meet more restricted FCC radio emissions requirements. As a result the FM transmitter is underpowered. Unfortunately, I bought one of these. The transmitter is so weak that it cannot overpower local signal noise even when the receiver is only 1 foot away from the stereo antenna. I tried to exchange it through Sirius' warranty department, but getting through to them was difficult. Between the customer service department and the warranty department, Sirius gave me the run around so long that I can't even return this defective receiver for a refund. To add insult to injury, Sirius will not give me a refund for the defective receiver either. I ended up cancelling my Sirius subscription because I can't listen to the service with this defective radio."
3,Good product if fidelity is no concern,"This Starmate ST2 works pretty well, a neat product, no/few commercials, etc.But, the fidelity is very disapointing to me, esp. after thinking it's digital so it must be good. I don't want to, but I may drop my subscription & go back to my CDs - some repetition, but very pleasant to listen to the very pure sound.I suppose this is due to Sirius not spending the money to transmit greater resolution?It is no where near the fidelity of Public Radio. I would say it's pretty much like AM (a real step backward IMO). It also emphasizes the bass way too much - a side effect of cost-saving maybe?Small point: I wish they would say what the FMout jack is for - I'm trying to find out if this signal can be put into my car antenna (aka a modulator), or is it just for hooking a wire to so as to make a stronger FM transmitted signal?Steve"
2,Stopped working after 2 months! Sirius service stinks!,"I got the ST2 sirius radio as a gift. I was able to install it easily in my car using the car kit - so far so good - 2 stars for ease of installation using the car kit.After about a month I noticed the reception was not so great even when connected to the home-kit with the antenna in a good spot. I knew it was a problem with this radio because we had no problems and good reception with our other Sirius radio. Over the next week or two the reception got worse. Now the radio does not work at all.The worst part is customer service. I have spent a total of 3 hours on hold and talked to one sales rep. Once I got a service rep he gave me a bogus excuse about phone reception and hung up. I have not made any progress so far with hours logged on hold. Now that I reseach it, I see that many other people have the same problem!ST2 seems to be a model with reliability problems."
2,FM Transmiter Sucks,"I love Sirius, and I have 2 units. The new model has a weak FM transmiter. If you have a audio input on your car deck, or a tape player with an adapter this unit is great. I can't even use my new one until I can get a new deck with audio input. You will never listen to old fashion, regular, comercial filled radio again after listening to Sirius. Howard Stern is so much better on satelite, I recomend giving it a try."
4,Good equipment better programming.,I recieved this for christmas as i guess alot of other people did. I just installed it in my car a few days ago and i have been happy so far. Installation was pretty easy. i routed the wire under my carpet and through the back seat. i left it on my trunk as i dont use my trunk to often so i dont think it would damage the wire any time soon. the receiver itself looks good although there wasnt any flat surface on my dash so i had to use the windshield. programs are great and i find myself often listining and trying to decide what to listen to. my only complaints are the preset buttons seem to be small. and the remote is way to small and i know im going to lose it at any time.
4,lousy customer service by seller,"I had this same model and it's worked great so wanted another one to use interchangeably between locations. Didn't have the opportunity to get it turned on and see if the whole thing worked as well as the one I had. But it doesn't - seems an issue with the reception inside the radio - want to be always ""acquiring signal"" or having gaps in the signal reception. Now the seller is out of business and can't or won't refund or replace. Took 2 weeks from ordering to get the radio and now no options. disappointed that the radio isn't a good as my old one, but even more disappointed in the seller."
1,Awful,My original radio didn't work. It has taken over 6 months to get a replacement from warranty. The customer service department is awful. They send you from department to department and never get anything done. I would never recommend Sirius to anyone.
1,Worked Great For 4 Months,"I gave this radio to my wife for Xmas as she is a Stern groupie and has a 1 hour commute, boring terrestrial radio couldn't keep her awake so getting this thing was a safety issue. The thing worked fantastic for 4 months and then quit, displaying the "" Acquiring Signal"" message ad infinitum. I called Sirius to get an RMA, sent it back and we are still waiting for the replacement after 2 weeks. I really think the radio sucummed to the heat these things generate which is an inherent design flaw so I have no confidence in the replacement lasting more than a few months. There is no reason for these radios( all makes and models generate excessive heat ) to get as hot as they do. Also, if you are expecting high fidelity audio out of satelite radio be it Sirius or XM you will be disappointed. Well heck, they need to plow some of their revenues into improving the technology."
1,Customer service anything but sirius...,"Customer service rating = ""F-"" for being siriusly useless.Customer service can often be siriusly rude.Customer service will cost sirius investers sirius bucks.A great idea dashed by the low ideals of customer care ""tactics"".Ah, when will they learn?~AX"
4,ST2 Radio,"Ive been really happy with it,I just want to find an awesome Boombox to go with it, Any ideas anyone?"
1,Not pleased,My daughter's band director told her never to use these reeds for class because they make her instrument sound awful. I now have to buy a better quality of reed. Not very happy.
1,Do Not Buy Purchase Rico ......TRY Vandoren Reeds Instead,These reeds are of poor quality and they do not produce the sound that can be achieved with Vandoren Reeds. If you are letting your students or child play on Rico Reeds then shame on you. Buy the quality reeds and they will succeed at a faster and more enjoyable rate. If you take care of Vandoren reeds then they will last longer.DO NOT BUY
1,Order did not come,I ordered my reeds from Amazon before but this time I am disappointed. My whole order has arrived and the smallest and most important part of my order which are my reeds are not here. I have a competition within the next week and live on a college campus without a car so I expected to have brand new reeds but this is not the case. Thank you so much for screwing up my order.
1,Paying for extra shipping was a WASTE!,"Ordinarily I receive Amazon orders within two business days.I paid for extra shipping for a one-day delivery. My orderarrived the third day. Signed, a DISGUSTED BUYER."
5,Clarinet reeds,My daughter really loves to use these Rico Bb Clarinet reeds. It really makes the sound from her instrument a lot better.
3,Chip/Split Easily,These Rico Bb clarinet reeds don't last as long as the Vandoren Bb clarinet reeds that I've used in the past.
2,Personally prefer the 2 1/2,"I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing. The reeds are fairly consistent, and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds (teacher, student, school, parent...). The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed, as long as they are not pushed in too far.However, the number 2 is reed is quite soft in my opinion. I have always started my middle school students on 2 1/2s, and have had plenty of success. I would have students try making sound on a 2 1/2 first and then go down only if students really struggle making a sound."
1,rico reeds,"poor quality for the money, they do not work well, tried playing the clarinet and the reeds seem too stiff to make the proper sound, would not recommend this item to anyone"
4,Very decent reeds,"Very decent reeds. My son was done (meaning all worn out) with all his 2.0 reeds and was advised to get higher number as he advances. This 2.5 wood reed are thicker and a little harder to blow, but he is very well pleased with them. He plays in his 5th grade school band. This will last him for some time before we get another set.Each individual reed is well protected in a plastic case."
1,Broken,The tumblers are beautiful but they was broken when I got them in the mail..I am wondering if they was broken before they was shipped out because they was packaged really well.
4,dense but infinitely rewarding,"Thick. Rich. Dense. Not to be consumed in one sitting. A source of unending nourishment. The kind of disc you can go back to over and over again without exhausting its treasures. Hans Keller said you could learn a symphony by listening to it repeatedly, but you could learn a string quartet only by playing it. Die Kunst der Fuge is not necessarily quartet music, of course, but it does in fact transcend any genre you could name; so I, for one, find it very satisfying to think I shall never completely know this piece simply by playing it. Only for the most musically-minded."
3,Expounds on generational perculiarities.,"This book does a fine job describing many of the cultural/generational factors facing churches in America today. Anderson highlights the perilous position many churches are in with regards to an ever evolving culture and a stagnated church, and emphasizes the neccesity of modifying our ministries to remain relavent, while at the same time preserving the orthodoxy of our doctrine. A helpful read for church planters but a vital resource for church leaders attempting to revitalize plateaued or declining congregations."
4,Review of album,"It's fine. thanks. I bought it for the song ""He said that he was Jesus."" It's a great story and illustration of what Christians should be doing."
4,"good book, but...","First of all, I want to express regret that there is no excellent book covering the area of theory, fabrication, characterization of semiconductor lasers/devices. Some are too easy and some are too difficult. The symbols and convention are not unified at all, even simple ""rate equations"" have a lot of versions.Overall, this book is good for graduate students. A good companion for advanced study. However, I don't like too many equations with only few explanations. By the way, on the small signal analysis of laser modulation, I recommend Coldren's ""Diode lasers and photonic integrated circuits"". Rate equations there make more sense to me. If you find it hard to understand, maybe try Parker's ""Physics of Optoelectronics"", an 5-star book. The strength of this book is its completeness, especially on optics, quantum mechanics and electromagnetics."
5,What great pictures,"This little compact book of postcards is amazing! Lots of black and white and color pictures, posters, advertizing! Postcards are 5 x 7 and wonderful for framing, making a collage, or sending to friends who also love the old west!Nice"
3,Right to the point...,This book provide good information and advices. All of them pragamatic. But don't stop there. The harder is to come. To think and write. It's hard yes. But not harder. Howard and Barton helps you to make a good start. And follow you from start to finish.A very useful read.
1,Do NOT buy this book,"My mother bought this for me when my son was shunted at a month old due to hydrocephalus. This book gave us wrong information about just about everything to expect. Find something more current, or ask your neuro-surgeon for a recommendation - but don't put yourself through reading this obsolete, upsetting and misinformed book."
4,Hydro Book,If you have a child with hydro or a close friend or relative with hydro this book is a must have. It is VERY informative. It's a great resource to turn to when in need of some answers.
1,Not so wonderful,"I dont think this book of wall paper pictures collection reflects the beauty, width and depth of the wallpaper design in 20th century. I have seen (and used) much better, detailed, artistic and representative examples myself.All of the examples are from the 1920-60 period. Nothing after 1960. The book doesnt include any of the glamorous examples either. Another negative thing is all of the examples look like they are printed patterns, they give no idea about the texture, embossing and the paper type used.If you are into the history of wallpapers this book may give you information but not much inspiring for graphic designers.I wouldnt have bought it if i had the chance to see more pages because what you see at the Amazon.com ""seach inside"" feature is all this book about, same style, same not so good examples all through the book."
3,A little disappointed...,"For as much as I paid, was surprised when I discovered the sprayer part is plastic. Sprayer is difficult to pull out and it doesn't retract easily. The overall look is good."
1,Beware of Leaks,"I have had this faucet for only about 2 1/2 years and today I opened my cabinet door to find all of my pots full of water. The faucet has been leaking from the inside and just running into the sink for sometime, but today it completely burst. I expect a $150 faucet to last much longer than this!!!! To beat all, I have the original UPC and model # off the box, but no receipt to claim the lifetime warranty. Will NEVER buy Moen again."
3,leaked at 22 months,Just called Moen today because mine is leaking just 22 months after installation. They were very nice and sending a replacement flow valve (plunger assembly) because mine is leaking water out of the top and running down inside my cabinet. There is not charge for the part and it should arrive in 7-10 business days. That is right - - over a week without water in the kitchen.
1,NOT WORTH IT,"Well - first of all it says 4 pages......it's 2 pages.2 Pages - and it says nothing new.any ""sales"" person knows all this - and so I was extremely disappointed.It's actually my fault for thinking for $5 - I might get some gems - some ""valuable"" information.It all comes down to use your head!!!DON'T BUY THIS - IT'S NOT WORTH IT."
5,Excellent resource,"Our daughter, aged nine has read the book entire book over many a times and would still like to read it again and again. She really liked the way the author has told the stories."
1,wrong belt,"well the fact is i bought this belt about three weeks ago and couldn't put it on right away and two days ago i had the time to do the job and when i attempted to put it on, wow it was too long wrong belt . didn't make me very happy."
4,pricey but good,"The Fluke 123 is a multi-purpose tool that will give the user the abiility to not only determine presence and magnitude of a whole host of electrical signals on two seperate channels at once, but also to graphically display waveforms, transients, individual encoder pulses etc. An excellent troubleshooting resource to have at my disposal.The price is somewhat higher than others and the battery life between recharging could be better. These are the only negatives here.While there are cheaper units out there, it is my opinion that there are none better."
3,Not their best..,"I would say that if you are looking to check out the Locust, steal their cds off of your friends and copy all the songs onto your computer and then burn an 80 track cd because paying 15 bucks for 10 minutes of music does not satisfy my money to music ratio.Don't get me wrong, I love the Locust but not because (to quote some bloke above) they are ""more hardcore"" than every other band. Just because they can fit their message into a 40 second burst and their live shows are unbelievable.In the end, don't purchase this cd unless you are rich."
3,Whoa. . . . . .,"Listening to this cd is like...I can't even describe it. It's like riding a motorcycle through a jungle that's on fire with giant robotic bugs swiping at your head. Or something of that nature. These vocalists don't really sing, I think. They scream and wretch over the top of lightning fast blast beats, wholly dischordant guitar riffs, and some freaky melodic synths and keyboards. This music is hands down the most psychotic stuff I've ever listened too. This stuff will blow your mind, whether you like the music or not. By the way, about 90 percent of the songs clock in at under 1 minute. This cd is pure sonic insanity. I still don't even know what to think about it."
3,Brahms in light divertimento style,"The Raphael ensemble, much beloved in England and basically unknown in the U.S., takes a light, flowing approach to these two works. This is quite a departure in style, but if you want to hear the Brahms sextets as background music, the way one would listen to a Baroque-era divertimento, everything is played veyr pleasantly. But Brahms was an ambitious chamber music composer, and he put into these sextets much more than surface appeal. There's a lot to dig into and explore, and the emoitonal range is much greater than suggested here. I will stick with other readings over the years from the Casals Festival, the Alban Berg Quartet, and the excellent group on Sony led by Isaac Stern and Yo-Yo Ma."
4,Good deal for the price,"I have bought several gun cleaning kits over the years and for the price this is a great deal. Recieved the kit with no problems, very nice case with a good assortment of attachments. I assembled the rods and a few attachements and have no complaints. A good kit for the average sportsman."
4,gun cleaning kit,"Kit is good, but the rods are made out of brass, so they tend to bend under pressure. Kit does come with every thing you need to get the job done."
3,Not quite the bargain it could be.,"You get a lot with this kit, but I broke and bent the ""solid brass rods"" on my first outing, without doing anything too taxing."
1,Garbage,"This cleaning kit is garbage. The cleaning patches and mops were covered in lint. The bottom of the ""wooden box"" is made out of slightly sturdier material than balsa wood. The adapter to connect the .22 attachments to the the thinner rod is to big to put into the .22 barrel. I was not going to scratch up the rifling by giving it a try. Also the brass brush for the .22 looked a little too sturdy for my taste (it was all rod and barely any bristles). I used the .17 cleaning brush to give my .22 model 60 a basic cleaning as I did not want to damage my gun. Called the company and they are sending out replacement parts even though I do not see what having more of the same will do, but maybe they have newer/better version (fingers crossed). Just spend the extra money and buy quality pieces separately and make your own cleaning kit."
1,Cheaply produced garbage,"Don't let the slick dvd cover art fool you. Horror fans take note: this is one of the most low-quality, amateur pieces of dreck you will likely experience. It comes off as if a community college film student decided to make a Hostel-style movie for his final project. The acting is horrible from all participants, the gore is sparse and when it does appear its pulled off in the most sophomoric, lackluster way possible in terms of special effects. The quality of this film is so much lower than your average direct-to-video flick. One moment had me laughing though, but make no mistake this was unintentional. Steer clear at all costs, save yourself the money and watch a superior film like Weekend at Bernie's II or Cobra."
5,Read it and weep,"Read it and weep. Weep because you will never live among such men in such a place. Weep because you can never again read it for the first time, but rejoice because you can read it again and again."
3,This book deserves better,"I fell in love with this book as a child, when I was admittedly a bit too young to be able to make sense of the gorgeous but frequently obscure language. Not many years ago, I reread it and my adult mind treasured it all the more (not to be confused with Impland the More).My biggest objection is that the Kindle edition lacks even a table of contents. I don't know whether that's the norm, as all my other Kindle books are freebies and one can't expect too many frills at that price. But I did pay for this one and wonder why at the very least, a table of contents isn't standard for all Kindle editions. I looked at a N*** book this morning and sure enough, it had a ToC.It would have been nice to have preserved the formatting, too. Despite what the sample shows, there is no difference of font between the main text and the Icelandic poem it quotes."
3,Free SF Reader,"The Worm Ouroboros is a high fantasy adventure, and most definitely archaic in style. Some people will probably find that quite impenetrable, as opposed to amusing. It is certainly worth a look for those interested in the origins of the genre. Warriors and warlords abound, here. Eddison is an author worth taking a look at."
5,"A CLASSIC, not to be missed","All readers of prose alike will agree that this is a stunningly constructed chef-d'ouevre, perhaps the best of Eddison's works.It truly leaves The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien with a lot of questions to answer. The narrative style is ephemeral, and may be appreciated by a reader of almost any ability. DO NOT MISS OUT ON READING THIS... put down any C-grade rags you might be currently enjoying, and turn to Ouroboros: it will be an enjoyable experience no matter what genre you prefer."
1,WHERE'S THE HELLHOUND MR. c?,"BLUES? Clapton never had 'em, and I suppose he never will!1 star for those who settle for ""nice, easy listening"".A sad corruption of the Johnson catalogue."
1,"With No Soul, He Got No Blues","Eric Clapton's fascination with the blues is legendary and way past wearing thin. He may be a world's most informed blues scholar, but that's never translated into any semblance of actually being able to play the blues. While Clapton can play a Robert Johnson tune note for note, he will never be able to invest anything personal into this music. It's a little cliche, but he's got no soul. And isn't that the one ingredient essential to blues and soul music?I've never really understood Clapton's gigantic reputation. His guitar playing is mechanical, lacking any swagger or excitement. His singing is serviceable at best. In time, history is likely to revise Clapton's importance, with records like this offering ample proof of a hollow effigy."
2,blues without a pain in the heart or a smile on your face...,"where robert johnson gave me the chills,ec gives me a feeling of boredom.commercial to the max.fine musicians(technicians) waisting their time.and mine,too.a friend gave me a copy,i wouldn't have boughtit anyway.for me, it was all over with ec a long time ago.come on...remember all this phil collins produced crap?""love in vain"" as a pop song?i didn't go down to the crossroads,but i followed my love down to the station a couple of times.i know how it feels and ec couldn't even scratch the surface.the stones came closer,much closer.this is all way too slick,overproduced,heartless and gutless. and terribly sung.sounds like eric hooked up with phil again.what a shame...zappalex"
1,Copy protection gives me the blues,How ironic!!! Clapton doesn't mind copying Robert Johnson but he copy protects the CD. If you play music on your Mac or an iPod then forget about this cd. It won't work. But that's OK. The original is much better than this anyway.
1,"pitiful, sad and a total waste of money","eric clapton has no balls and he proves it on this sad attempt at ripping off robert johnsonanyone who thinks this remotely resembles the blues is either a fool or plain dumbthe only thing that this would be useful for would be the cd booklet in case you ran out of toilet paper, if that"
5,Slowhand At His Best!,"Clapton has always excelled at the Blues, and shown a preference for the genre. The liner notes of ""Me & Mr. Johnson"" explain why. He fell in love with Robert Johnson's music early on, and has used it to guide him throughout his career. Slowhand will make you love this music too."
1,What's the Point?,"Some reviewers have called this CD ""blues-zak,"" and I completely agree! The rhythym is unvaried and annoying, and Clapton is just trying too hard! He's thinking about it too much--not ""feeling it."" He did some great stuff with Cream, and he's obviously a great guitarist. But this album is way over-produced and IS NOT THE BLUES, outside of 12-bar structure, etc. Robert Johnson is great, of course, but he is not the only great blues guy. I would advise to check out some other old blues, like Skip James. If you are more of a rock person and have to get your Clapton fill, stick with Cream. Therefore, this album is totally pointless--unless you own every blues CD ever made. And then it's just bad."
2,"Focus Eric, focus","Clapton is one of the most erratic rock/blues stars ever. He could make a masterpiece and then release the worst flop. He could play the guitar like a god, and then sound like his own bad imitator. Clapton credentials as a bluesman cannot be argued: he has been hailed as a master by every blues icon that ever listened to him: From Muddy and Wolf, to Hendrix and SRV. I think what Eric needed here was a good producer, a guy that would be able to stand up to him and say 'excuse me, Mr Clapton, lets try again, and now do it like you mean it'. And for the other musicians, they sound bored as hell. Eric usually plays better when he is challenged, and this band has been playing with him for so long that he is as excited as having lunch with his grandmother. This is such a missed opportunity. Robert Johnson deserves better. Check out the recent tributes by Peter Green and see the difference."
2,Boring,"Love Robert Johnson.Listened to this album every day for almost a week.Tried to like it.Can't do it...it's just too flat and bland, no grit, no feeling.Clapton himself has done better Robert Johnson-covers than these lifeless songs. And Peter Green's two RJ-albums blow this one out of the water and into the stratosphere.What's the opposite of memorable? Oh, right. Forgettable. This album is thoroughly forgettable. Take your man Ron's word for it and pick up some REAL RJ instead."
2,Synthetic recording...,"Eric Clapton tried to make his best blues recording. That should be appreciated. But... I do not believe these tunes. Yes, they sound like blues, but where is the soul? Most of the tracks sound artificial (""this should be done like this and that"") rather than music coming from the very heart. There is variety of tempo's and styles, but all of them are too polished and not natural. This is synthetic music for the music itself. That is not the music for heart and brain."
2,For Clapton superfans and completists only,"If you want to hear Robert Johnson songs, get Robert Johnson.While there are some good versions of his songs by other people, a whole album of them by anyone else is boring and pedantic. This effort is not horrible, but it isn't particularly compelling for a lot of reasons. Eric Clapton's only claim to greatness is as a blues guitarist, and the guitar work here is good but not great.The vast majority of the people who buy this, at least in the US, are going to be people that not only do not own the originals, but may have never heard them. It's a ridiculous situation. Don't be ridiculous-get the real thing first. If you don't love them, you'd be utterly wasting your money on this anyway."
2,Extremely mediocre,"This is the most disappointing Clapton album I've ever purchased. I agree with the reviewer who noted the lack of energy and enthusiasm in these recordings. There's just no fire, no spark of passion, no synergy among the band members. It's like they're playing the part of revivalist blues musicians in a B movie, making a handwaving attempt to play the songs in some ""authentic"" way but never quite pulling it off. This is especially disappointing, given that Clapton has recorded numerous Robert Johnson songs over the years that do have the kind of energy and creativity I was hoping (in vain) to find here. I bought this CD the first week it came out, listened to parts of it three or four times, then put it back in the case, where it will probably stay. If you want to hear really outstanding but not derivative versions of Johnson's songs, order the two Peter Green CDs, which are much much better."
2,Too Slick = Boring,"First off, I liked EC's ""From The Cradle"" cd and would rate that one 4 stars, on the other hand I was debating between 1 or 2 stars for this one, and decided on 2 because it's not terrible. The problem I have with this one is it just sounds way too slick and the songs seem to have no passion in them at all, to me it just sounds like a waste of time. I had to force my self to listen to it several times hoping I was missing something and it would grow on me, but that didn't happen. If your'e gonna do Robert Johnson stuff at least sing it/play it like you mean it. This cd reminds me of the ""paint by numbers"" art I did as a kid. A VERY disappointing effort by someone that should know better."
1,Pathetic,"How dare Eric Clapton! What is up with Clapton appearing on the same cd cover with Robert Johnson? it is completelly absurd. What is the point? A rich Englishman with absolutely no life experience beyond garden parties, drinking tea and eating crumpets, pretending to have some kind of connection to Robert Johnson..........I say again.........Absurd! What is the point? Eric Clapton has got to be the most over rated musician of all time.p.s. Why is Eric Clapton so big on the cover and Robert Johnson so Small?"
3,Mine's not copy protected,"I just ripped it into iTunes and put it on my iPod, on which I am listening to it at this moment. So cleary it isn't copy protected everywhere.OK music.I prefer the original."
3,"If You Get This, You Better Have The Originals","Ok, it's Clapton, so if you're mildly a rock 'n roll fan, Clapton is hard to ignore. But, Clapton doesn't sound hungry or earnest on these brilliant RJ cuts. Quite frankly, he hasn't in a long while either. If these weren't Robert Johnson songs, this would be a generic lullaby set from one lazy dude. Start by getting the original Johnson cuts, then if you're an EC fan, might as well get this. Otherwise, flip a coin on this one."
2,Disappointed,"I like the blues. I like Robert Johnson. I like Eric Clapton. If you share these likes, don't buy this CD. It is spiritless. Get Clapton's ""Unplugged"" if you like acoustic blues. Get him teamed up B.B. King on ""Riding with the King"" if you like your blues electric."
2,How to make the blues sound - mauve.,"An interesting experiment that did not work. The album is spoiled mostly by the overslick production and the plodding, boring musicianship and arrangements. The end result is bland muzak versions of some of the most powerful songs ever written. If this had not been a famous artist, it would never have been released."
2,Straight Clapton not finding the roots,"Anyone that records Robert Johnson is setting themselves a task - there's a certain feel to his music that cannot be mucked around with. Here Clapton mostly loses the plot. The cover seems to indicate the album might be another unplugged set which could have been wonderful, but the big bass and drum sound behind a heavily distorted guitar on many tracks just doesn't get to the soul of the music. A couple of songs like Me and the Devil Blues and Last Fair Deal Gone Down come off OK, but all in all this pales alongside the two Johnson albums made by his old associate Peter Green."
2,Pretty weak effort,"Don't expect to hear amazing blues guitar, or much guitar playing of any sort, on this misleadingly titled CD. A more descriptive title would have been ""Clapton sings Johnson"". What little guitar playing there is, is obscured by the piano & rest of the band. I was pretty disappointed. Seems like Clapton has regressed back to the 70s when he rarely played on his albums. Maybe his legend has surpassed his ability & he's afraid to let us find out."
2,Two stars for the song writing of Robert Johnson.,"This entire album sounds flat and uninspired. The guitar playing is just okay. The rhythms Clapton chooses for many of these Johnson gems seems off and further detracts from their impact on the listener. Some cuts seem to drag and sound somber, others are played too fast when they should be done slower, with more feeling.If you want to hear some terrific covers of Robert Johnson songs try Peter Green's; Hot Foot Powder (his Robert Johnson Songbook is also pretty good). Or you can always go straight to the master himself with The Complete Works of Robert Johnson.This CD does nothing to change my opinion that Clapton's best blues playing is past. Clapton sites Johnson as his main inspiration, but here he doesn't do justice to Johnson's songs."
1,MAKE HIM STOP!!!,"Hasn't the guy made enough money hamming up the blues for some time now? This takes the cake and is about as silly as Bush dressing up like a cowboy on his Texas ranch...actually this is worse. He should be smacked across the face for this stupid suit. If he's going to keep reliving the past why can't he just relive his own past and go back to Cream. That was the only time he did anything worth a crap-the new dvd is about as painful as this so I guess he should just stop recording period.This guy ONLY cares about a paycheck, or his manager is just shoving him into these stupid recording sessions. Either way it's still his fault for doing this cheesy blues-zak.This album should make the whitest man sick to his stomach."
3,Hand gettin' slower?,"EC, contributer Andrea kind of stripped all the gooey cliches away, and came right out and commented - correctly - that you're just making a down payment on a retirement condo or something. I just wish you'd taken on Robert Johnson about 30 years earlier, and I am ecstatic to see that you're working with Billy Preston, but....I dunno, it's just difficult to take you seriously anymore after that crap you did with ""Babyface"" for the Revolta movie. Thanks for what you did for the George Harrison memorial concert, but - like Ian Hunter said, ""It mesmerizes and I can't explain."""
3,Better than his last couple......,"As a long time Clapton fan, Rock fan, and Blues fan I can honestly say this CD did nothing for me. At least it doesn't contain the Drum machine and other slick tricks of his last couple outings! I think I could find something better to listen to in at least a dozen local bars on a Saturday night.I love all the people who played on the CD but they just weren't kickin' it like they should. The tribute CD ""Hellhound On My Trail"" is much more interesting.If the vocals had been a little rougher around the edges it would have been far better. I can only imagine Robert Johnson playing smokey bars, loud and loose, but this CD seems more like a Sunday afternoon for the family in the park."
4,Excellent!,"This record sounds great! It is raw and very nicely engineered. The playing is excellent, particulary Steve Gadd and of course Eric Clapton. Many of the negative reviews seemed to be personal jabs at Clapton rather than intelligent critiques. I've been playing Robert Johnson for 20 years and I feel this is a very inspiring tribute. Nice!!!"
3,Doesn't Do Robert Johnson Much Justice,"Okay, don't get me wrong. This is a great album. However, there are alot of things wrong with it. It is, however, a great retrospective of Robert Johnson's greatest recordings.There are a few things wrong with this disc. One of the problems is Clapton's vocal atempt at matching Robert Johnson's vocal talents. When he tries to sound like Johnson, his voice cracks like he's going through adolescence again. Also, Clapton's style of playing does not equal Johnson's original sound and at times sounds forced.All criticism aside, this is a great tool for people trying to find out more about Robert Johnson. It gives a great look at one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century."
5,Just as good.,To appreciate this album you have to throw out comparing Eric Clapton and Robert Johnson. You just have to look at it as if it was just any old blues album. Seeing that it's one of the best I've ever heard. If you're a blues fan you can't listen to this album and say it's no good. If I'm in a blues mood playing this album would fit the bill as well as any other.
1,ANOTHER BLUES COVER CD - WHAT A SURPRISE!!!!,Another shallow attempt to cash in on his history ( about 35 years ago now since he produced something worthwhile ) WHO BUYS THIS CRAP????????
2,Clapton is a great player but something is missing,"Listening to this reminds of the part in the movie Ghost World where a woman is talking to the blues collector and says ""If you want to hear real blues you have to hear 'Blues Hammer'"" and this cheesy electric guitar playing white boy comes out singing about picking cotton. EC is not that bad but there is no way for ANYONE to tackle the original material of Robert Johnson. But don't take my word for it, just listen to the complete recordings of Johnson and then this back to back. I give EC credit for possibly getting more people interested in Johnson's work though."
1,not clapton,"this is not the eric clapton i know. when he does blues that is clapton. i wish he would do another blues like ""from the cradle."""
2,You must see the live versions to fully appreciate,"I do agree with most reviewers below re: the studio versions (the versions on this CD) being lifeless and lacking the intensity that Robert Johnson's songs require. However, you must hear the EC 2004 tour live versions of Me And The Devil, They're Red Hot, Milkcow Calf Blues, If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day, and Kind Hearted Woman Blues. Clapton coverning the blues needs to be heard live - most of Eric's classic performances of the great blues songs are best heard live. (exception: Derek and the Dominos studio versions of Key To the Highway and Have You Ever Loved a Woman).I give this CD 2 stars due to the lame production. However, it was a great concept. They just needed to perform these 14 songs in front of a live audience and recorded the result!!Go see Eric if he is plays your hometown."
3,Not what I would expect,"Clapton's rendition of Johnson's songs are too clean and polished and lack ""soul."" I was a little dismayed that the CD wasn't just Clapton and an acoustic guitar. I was also dismayed that Sweet Home Chicago, Terraplane Blues, and Dead Shrimp Blues were not tracks on this album.It is a decent effort by a great guitar technician, just not what I consider true ""delta"" blues."
2,Hate to admit it,"Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good. Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing. This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together. The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself.Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'."
2,OK - and very repetitious,"I admit that I'm an Eric Clapton fan from forty-some-odd years back, before Cream. But I'm disappointed. This is an OK album, worth about 2-1/2 stars.The biggest problem is that this album is that it doesn't offer much variety. I go way back on the blues, but it the songs on this album all start sounding the same to me.And isn't this deja vu all over again? Isn't the 11th song on this album ""Rollin' and Tumblin'"" from the Cream album???? Sounds identical to me."
3,Not impressed,"This project had a lot of potential, but in the end, it didn't make it onto the final product. What you're left with is a bit over produced and flat renditions. If you want the soul and grit of Robert Johnson - go to the source.If your looking some surprising blues work - check out In Session with Albert King and SRV..."
3,Just like the other one (From the Cradle),"Well, it would've sounded better to have just a few guys in there taking a few chances. This is so darn even that it doesn't give me much to listen to. All the classic blues of long ago were spare, punchy arrangements. These are not.It's a good set of blues songs to do, but it don't hold a candle to Robert Johnson. Or maybe that's all it does..."
4,"""IF IT'S SO OLD WHY ARE THEY PLAYING IT?""","Around the time Clapton released In The Cradle, his last blues ""tribute"" album, I was in my car listening to the local college station. The station was playing a cut from the CD when my eight-year-old son asked what it was. I explained to him that it was an old blues number that was a sort of precursor to much of the music we listen to now. He inquired how old the song was and I replied it was almost fifty years old. My son then asked: ""If it's so old why are they playing it?""I'm afraid that is how most people will react to some degree to this album. ""It's all nice and all that Clapton loves this music; but why inflict it on us?"" This will come from those who think Clapton matters. I sense among the younger artists Clapton ceased to matter years ago.This all too bad. This is an excellent CD and bears repeated spins in the old CD player. Unfortunately, much like In The Cradle, it will be more honored than listened to"
5,Music,Bought this for my boyfriend last year. He enjoys the Blues and plays them in his car daily. He wanted this specific CD. Glad that I was able to find it for him.
4,A Disciple Keeps the Faith,"Perfect? No . . . but very, very close. Eric Clapton remains true to the depth and power of the originals. At once, both in his singing and playing, Clapton manages to echo Robert Johnson -- while bringing his own potency to the interpretations. He plays with sureness and a keen appreciation of the music. He is a mature artist at the top of his game, surrounded by first-class players -- from Jerry Portnoy's harp to Steve Gadd's signature drum work to Billy Preston's dazzling turn on keys. Thank you, Mr. Clapton. Mr. Johnson is smiling."
1,Who is Eric Clapton?,"This is a question I've been asking myself since the demise of Blind Faith. Where is the hot-riffed kid I saw on stage at the Filmore East when I was far too young to get in who blew me away with riffs that - to this day - no one has been able to match? The solos in Crossroads are some of the very best in rock history. So I go back to my original question. Who is Clapton? A guy who died 30 years ago with the old gang, including Winwood, Bruce, Baker, Mayal and the rest of the late 60's greats? Where did that unbelievably inspired young guitarist who set the world on fire go? To this day, I have never quite understood his path, with the the exception that heroine was kicked...along with the riffs. This tribute album is yet another in a series of attempts to recapture the essence of a past that continues to eluded him."
2,I just don't see how this is called the blues...,"I agree with many fellow reviewers that say that this is one of EC's better releases in a while, but let's not confuse this with real blues. This CD lacks soul and depth. It is worth casual listening, but after the fourth or fifth playing it feels stale and mediocre. After listening to John Lee Hooker, Son House & Elmore James continuously for the past month, you'll find this recording as bland as I did. I just didn't feel the music. If Buddy Guy is your flavor, this might work. Otherwise, stay away and spend your money on any John Lee Hooker. You'll be glad you did."
2,Robert Johnson LITE,"Well...I've digested the new CD by Eric Clapton, ""Me & Mr. Johnson"", his so-called tribute to Robert Johnson.I won't rant on with a long review, but I'm shocked to hear the world's most spooky, raw blues songs rendered into a nice, suburban, Disney-safe format...as if Clapton had never even heard these songs before and is reading them off a song sheet. One of the rare albums that gets worse the more times you listen to it...However, my take on it results in the notion that the CD's title should be changed...this should give you an idea of what I REALLY think about this. So, rather than ""Me & Mr. Johnson"", might I suggest...""Amos and Andy and Mr. Johnson""""Eric Clapton as Robert Johnson TONITE! - on FOX!""""Robert Johnson for Dummies""""Eric Clapton's Delta Blues Minstral Show""""Robert Johnson Lite - All the Tunes With None of the Blues""""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Robert Johnson""Buy at your own risk..."
2,Tepid,"This collection of Robert Johnson songs is OK, but ... that's all it is. Clapton's approach to the material is reverent; perhaps too reverent to be enjoyable. If you're familiar with Robert Johnson, you know that the blues isn't all about being miserable and sad. Often, it's about having fun (perhaps in spite of being miserable and sad). These are all competent covers, but there's no sense of exuberance or excitement.Comparing these versions to Johnson's originals is beside the point. However, it's only fair to compare Clapton's contemporary interpretations with those of the Peter Green/Nigel Watson Splinter Group, whose superb, award-winning ""Robert Johnson Songbook"" is warm, seductive, delightful, smooth, and yes, exuberant in places.True-blue Clapton fans will want to pick this one up, but most listeners will have more fun with the Splinter Group disc. (Also highly recommended: ""Hot Foot Powder"", Splinter Group's equally fine second collection of Robert Johnson songs.)"
2,Is This Release Necessary?,"New rule: all blues records recorded by aging white rock giants automatically should automatically receive two stars, meaning neither here nor there. Only on ""Milkcow's Calf Blues"" does Clapton give his listeners a surprise.For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"
1,"Gets one star, because I can't give it a black hole","I can't believe that this jerk sells his crap. If he redoes ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" some idiot will buy that too! It's time to retire, Eric."
2,To Make Money,"Now don't get me wrong, I love Robert Johnson Covers, but to devote a whole album to it is just insane. There is barley even any artistic expresion on this album, its just trying to make Robert Johnson sound modern, but there is only one Robert Johnson. Now when Clapton did Crossroads, it was cool because it actually sounded like he put some work into that Johnson song, but the songs on this album is just what Johnson did with a Chicago/British blues feel to it."
1,Blooz-zak,"In his own inimatible way, Clapton does for Robert Johnson what Pat Boone did for Little Richard....pablum blooz-zak at its best. White as snow, smooth as syrup. If that's the way you like your Robert Johnson, buy this album. -Dadfad"
5,Love it.,"One of my favorite Clapton albums. Couldn't stand to hear ""Wonderful Tonight"" one more time but love the way he plays the blues. While purist Robert Johnson fans may object to anyone, anywhere reinterpreting the master, Clapton knows what he is doing. He just does it his way. Can't blame an artist for that and fortunately for us fans, we love him for it. This album is a different, more polished version than the DVD. I like them both for what they are. I try to listen to every version recorded of ""C'mon in My Kitchen"" and this album contains my second favorite version. Unfortunately Bonnie Raitt has never recorded her version. My only wish is that Clapton would record more albums like this one."
3,"Just ""OK""","Like many other reviewers, I was expecting to be blown away by this CD. It is a fairly sterilized and pasteurized tribute album to Robert Johnson rather than the potential mind-blowing blockbluster it should have been. Even my favorite track from the CD, ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day"", was done more powerfully and passionately on Clapton's ""Unplugged"" effort.The tracks are all good and enjoyable to listen to, but the mediocre arrangements are simply disappointing."
3,Me and Mr Johnson,"'Me and Mr Johnson' has some solid playing from EC and his love and mastery of Robert Johnson's musics is pretty evident on this album. I think the reason why this album gets slated as much as it does is because the terrible Simon Climie production relegates it to the 'elevator' music described by other reviewers. The music and playing are pretty good (although without the fire and passion of 'From the Cradle') but the production is yet again flat and uninspiring. When will EC learn everyone hates this style of production and it does nothing for his music? This album is very polished and slick, which detracts from the rawness of the blues played, but there are some good tracks here and it's a good homage from EC of Johnson's amazing playing and song writing. A solid 3 stars, but it could've delivered so much more.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,white boy plays the blues...,"Pick this cd up if you are into elevator music versions of songs you like. These versions a safely played well inside the lines to the point of a bored stupor. It's paint by the numbers blues, which is you are a clapton fan you may like, otherwise, if you like the older recordings of these numbers your head will be in a musically better place if you don't partake in this."
2,If You Want To Hear the Album This SHOULD Have Been:,"Of the many Clapton personaes in existence, this is not the worst of them, but it is the most disappointing. Fans of Clapton's rawer, truer blues and blues rock (especially from his earlier years), already know not to buy most of the studio albums, but we are always waiting for him to put out the ""real thing."" If that is your Clapton of choice, you will be very disappointed by this over-produced, under-performed attempt to make the blues as accessible and commercially viable as possible.If you would like to hear the blues/rock album this could/should have been (at least in feel and performance) - you MUST check out Buddy Guy's album, ""Sweet Tea."" Go to that album NOW. Listen to the samples, buy it, and lose yourself!!"
2,"Over priced, under delivered","This is really about Eric cashing in. The CD is delivered in a cheesy paper cover rather than plastic jewel box. The recording quality is sub-standard. The songs are slick and polished, and don't sound very genuine. I am a Clapton fan, but the standard he set with ""Unplugged"" was not met with this release. In fact, it speaks to why the mass music business is in trouble. It is overpriced and sub-par effort."
2,too polished&too Predictable,"Eric clapton long ago cemented Himself as one of the Best Guitarist Ever especially back in the 60's,but after a while he found a way to play it safe&He does it here again as He has been doing for many years now.Robert Johnson was Raw&wicked.Eric Clapton has displayed some of that Element Before but it's been so long that after a while He is basically a Vegas Lounge Act with Talent but who hasn't mattered in so long.this Album will keep him safe&in place to where he is but He didn't bring any Light to the Rawness that was Robert Johnson."
3,Can there be too much respect?,"You can hear Clapton struggling for authenticity on this one. Listen to ""Kind Hearted Woman Blues"" and you'll wince when Clapton goes for that deep throated blues bass vocal. Sure there are worthy efforts like ""Hellhound on my Trail,"" where Clapton seems to be really feeling it, but ultimately this doesn't have anything but competence going for it.Everything here is mannered and professionally presented; it would have been so much better if Clapton just let it rip. This really adds nothing to the legacy of Clapton or Johnson."
1,Very disappointed...,"I like both EC and Robert Johnson, but this collection just does not work. Many years ago EC did a great job interpreting Crossroads in a modern rock/blues cover, but these new arrangements are light-hearted versions of some very heavy, soulful songs. I'm sure Mr. Clapton could have done a better job. Save your money and get the original recordings."
3,Entertaining,"This third book in the Jackie Walsh series is a nice, easy read despite the fact that the author seems to be a bit confused about the time the story takes place. Ex-cop Matt Dugan was killed ""last November"", which supposedly happened nine month ago. If I'm not mistaken (and I'm not, because this fact is mentioned numerous times throughout the book), this puts us somewhere around August. Yet on page 42 our heroine Jackie Walsh glances out of a window and observes that the dogwoods and azaleas are blooming in the spring air.Even if the term ""spring air"" is just an expression of artistic freedom, last time I checked, dogwoods and azaleas don't bloom in August.Despite this little slip-up and the fact that Melissa Cleary is not exactly in the same league with Susan Conant and Leslie O'Kane, I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the other books in the series."
4,Southside represents to the fullest!!,"First of all, I know this guy is gonna get a lot of trash talk because he is white. Also he is gonna be called a Slim Shady wanna be. The first time I heard UGLY on the radio, I really thought he was black. I tripped when I saw the video. I mean, he can really flow. Every song has tight beats, some by Timbaland. His flow and voice kinda resembles Ludacris. I recommend this cd to any hip hop/Southern hip hop fan. Peace"
4,Bubba Sparxxx is legit.,"Honestly, I didn't know what to expect when I heard the entire album, but let me be the first to say it: Bubba Sparxxx is legit! The album is tight, and I would say a must have for any true hip hop head."
2,For the beats,"Timbaland has dope beats, but Bubbas voice is so wack. Ugly is the only dope song, after that his voice gets annoying. But Tim's got the beats. He should probably make an instrumental album."
4,go coop the album,cd was good best song on their was 16 he had some tight beats and tight lyrics go get it
3,It sure is ugly,"Well to be honest I expected a bit more from this album.The lead off single ""UGLY"" is the best beat and the best song on the album I mainly bought the album because Timbaland is one off the best producers in the rap industry but when you hear ""UGLY"" you think that the whole album is produced by Timbaland but Organized Noise drop some beats for the Athens native so I was a bit surprised by that.A lot of people are comparing Bubba to Eminem but he isn't in the same leauge as him.After the ""UGLY"" track the best song is ""TWIRK A LITTLE"" which features Timbaland this track should be played very loud as the beat is another Timbaland classic.Hopefully Bubbas next LP is better than DARK DAYS,BRIGHT NIGHTS"
2,OK/Mediocre at best.,"The beats and production are top notch and reminiscent of the work Timbaland provided for Missy Elliot's latest album.The problem with this album lies in Bubba Sparxxx's rhyming. At best, his rhyming is merely adequate, nothing to get excited about.Very few rhymers in the history of rap (dating back to the late 1970s and up through the present) can grab you with a few words and their vocal tone. Bubba Sparxxx. He just doesn't compare to even the best rhymers of today, nevermind the best lyricists of the past 20-plus years.But perhaps like Eminem, fans are going to buy into his album as they usually do when a novelty rapper who at least shows an average level of skills surfaces.But for a better overall album with sound production (and a variety of styles) and stronger lyrical delivery, check out Petey Pablo's ""Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry."""
3,This CD wore on me,"After a fairly hot single and big Timbaland hype, I bought this disc and was happy with it for a couple of weeks. Then it got old, stale and boring. I can hardly listen to it any more, where other cd's just seem to get better with age.If you're looking for GREAT Southern Hip Hop, grab some old-school Outkast (Southernplayalistic or ATLiens), the first Nappy Roots album (I haven't heard enough of the second album to have an opinion), or even get some southern flavor from Devin the Dude (""the Dude"" is better than ""Trying to Live"") or Scarface. This CD was mediocre at best, but still better than a lot of the other crap that's out there, hence the 3 stars."
3,"bubba tries to get "" crunk""","on first listen i was disapointed i wanted more songs like ugly wich is one of the best rap songs all year as far as singles go my other favorites are ""take off"" wich i found profound with all the anxiety of flying in this war time and ""well water"" wich has got one of the greasest hooks ive ever heard now this cd may take a while to click some times bubbas voice is pushed back in the mix and tims beats cant always save him but those arent big complaints for a debut the only real problem is its a bit overloaded and longish and considering it reaches its high points quite early some poeple might lose interest after a while when listening but if tim can push bubba to find something new to say and make a cd thats tighter then he could be a huge superstar"
4,"if you have multiple Outkast & Goodie MOB albums, get this!","leave it to Timbaland to come with somethin new & hot, that completely departs from he is known for! i had never really considered Tim a producer of ""south coast"" ... i mean this is the same cate that did ""Jigga What, Jigga Who"" and ""Ryde or Die Chick"", but he not only goes south with Bubba, he has crafted the dopest South Coast album since ""Stankonia"". nuff respect to Tim for staying out ahead the pack & not be worried about populariy ...as for Bubba, yes he can flow, yes he's country, yes he's white ... gimmicks aside, the only thing that matters is that the album is hot! while not very diverse, the album is consistent & good. very similar to an old Outkast or Gooodie MOB album ... he even had Organized Noise produce a few tracks on the album. best songs were ""Twerk a little"", ""If its bumpin"", ""Ugly"", ""take off"" & ""all the same"". if you have multiple Outkast & Goodie MOB albums, then you should get this!"
3,"give it a try, yo","when i first copped this cd all i liked was the song ugly. but now i dig some of the other cuts on the disc...it just took some time to get into it. he can flow pretty good but usually over a dark slow type of beat, but his style works overall. the beats are decent on some songs and really good on others. it will be interesting to see what bubba does from here on out. his lyrics are recycled throughout this album though---he talks about drinking, the south, and bettys...over and over and over again."
4,The beast,This is a great CD and everyone should buy it. Bubba Sparxxx is a great rapper and he will be the next eminem. Everyone should buy this great cd
2,A DONT BUY ALBUM,Bubba is ok and tight beats but his voice kills the whole cd. lots of other rappers rep the south but he sound like a western farm boy to much.Ugly is the best song so get the ugly single but dont waste your money on like only 3 songs that are good. I respect any white rap.....its not what you look like its just if you got skill. But eminem is the best white rapper and 1 of the best out of everybody.but bubba needs more skill. and how did he get signed??do not buy!!
4,Better than feminem.,"Bubba Sparxxx has even less to do with it's mother hating, daughter loving and pop star attacks, then last year's screaming bad version of the marshall mathers lp, he may not talk about fancy cars, At least he talks about chicks and other stuff better then feminem could do, I Can't wait until bubba's next album."
5,Loved it!,One of the best albums ever to come out of the south!! This is the true Bubba Sparxxx! Love it
4,good bustin jammy jamZies!,"this album has all the elemental beats to get your party kicked off right!!just plug in your radio,pop in this bubba sparxxx classic and drink a few colas with the boyZ!!better make it caffeine freE cola-cause this album will make you hyper!HAVE FUN AND CRANK IT!"
2,It's aight,"Bubba shows promise with his lyrics, but they don't seem to match the tacky beats by Timbaland...the nice chorus and hook found on Ugly is matched w/ good lyrics and that led to success; but the rest of the cd isn't this way. It is disappointing that no track can come near matching the caliber of Ugly, and his next single Lovely is weak as well. Sparxxx's CD isn't bad, has several tracks that are good... would have worked better with a producer like Scarface than Timbaland however. Decent party music."
2,HUH?!..I give him 2starts just for trying,"I'm not feeling it..he not saying nothing new and the beats sound wacky and bubbagum like (POP)If you like simple lyrics and you just like the club music vibe, well this CD is just for you...."
5,Harry Potter in French,This is the french language version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. My daughter wanted this version and Amazon had it.
2,Choose A different bag,This bag got a hole a few months after I purchased it (mainly as a hot water bottle for my back). Go with another model.
3,"Pretty good, could use improvements.","I like this product because it doesn't ""sweat"" so much, like a plastic bag, and get clothes, etc. wet. That was the main thing I was looking for. However, as some have said, it's a bulky cap, and sometimes is in the way. And, for such a large cap, it's not that easy to fill it with ice. It would have been better if they had put it directly on the top, facing down into the bag. As it is , it's difficult to pull the opposite side away, so as to make roon for the ice to enter."
4,Thermalon Ice Bag/Water Bottle,I bought this for travel and have used it now on several trips. It packs light and is perfect for travel. You can use it with hot water or ice cubes. It looked a little wet (darker in spots) after the ice started melting but I could not detect water on the surface.The only inprovement would be to replace the hard plastic opening with a fold over closure - like a dry bag. This would make it easier to load ice cubes and you would not have an uncomfortable hard spot on the surface of the bag.
3,Good product but only for limited uses.,"I bought this item to be able to apply heat to various muscles that were stiff and causing pain. It is great to use in some circumstances. However the inconvenience of keeping it in place using the band provided and it's shape after it is filled with water convinced me to buy a moist heat electric pad. I ordered one from Amazon, but later cancelled due to the one month shipping delay and bought the same at Walmart for a slightly lower price. The pad cannot be made as hot as the water bottle (you can put very hot water in there), but it is very easy to use and serves more functions ( back, calves, thighs) than the water bottle.However, I was impressed by the bottle's ability to handle heat and I still use it from time to time when I need higher temperatures."
5,Love this bag as a heat pack,"I ordered this bag to use as a hot water bottle for labor (since one was recommended in our childbirth preparation classes), however, I have found it to be the perfect remedy to late pregnancy back pains and aches. And it is safer for me to use than a traditional heating pad, but still provides the same relief and the heat lasts amazingly long (and that's just with hot water our of the tap)! I'm very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend this. It doesn't leak like other bags and is flat so perfect for putting against your back!I'm even thinking of ordering more for family in colder climates since it would keep them so warm and toasty."
2,Leaked the first time I used it,"Bought this to use as an ice pack to sit on (hamstring injury) while on a long plane flight. Worked ok until I realized it was leaking around the seal of the cap. So, it's not strong enough to sit on."
1,total dissappointment,I bought these hats - one for my son and one for a couple of Seniors in college so that they could have a little fun with their friends.I had spent a Christmas in England with family and had a blast which is why i bought two to use here.I was so dismayed when neither of them worked.I think I was sent seconds. What are the chances of ordering two hats and both of them not working. There was no manufacturer note inside the box with directions -nothing in fact except for the parts. I tried to find the company on line - nothing there either:-)Whatever you do - DONT buy one unless you can see that it works first.
1,This toy was broken in about one minute,I saw this game on a popular morning news show and it really looked like fun. One hot day I brought it out for my kids to play and it fell apart even before the game began. Water leaked from the hard hat and the spring popped out. This would be a very fun game if it were manufactured better.
3,A Fun Retelling of Scrooge,"Despite many people hating this film, I always found it entertaining. Sure it's not the best movie ever made but it's fun. I can't say I don't see why some people might not like it. It's a pretty crude adult retelling of Scrooge. Where a bossy and mean television producer (Bill Murray) who's making a new version of Scrooge gets vistited by 3 ghosts of his own.The film is crude and whacky but it also has a sweet side. The ghosts try to reconnect him with a good woman that he broke-up with long ago. With Karen Allen from Raiders of the Lost Ark playing her and adding a needed loveableness to the film. The film needs it since it can be mean spirited. Then it tacks on a happy and goofy ""we're aware this is a movie you were just watching"" ending. So it is a bit of a mess I admit but I still find it hard to change when I notice it's on television. It's a fun comedy/fantasy with a good cast."
5,I Wish They Would Make A Sequal,"No matter hwo many times that I watch this, I still can't get enough of Scrooged. Every time I watch this, I somehow get the theme song (""Put A Little Love In Your Heart"") stuck in my head. After all, it is the perfect song for this otherwise strangely funny comedy."
5,Underated Classic,"Like gifted screenwriter Mitch Glazer's ""Great Expectations"" (Glazer collaborated with friend Michael O'Donoghue On ""Scrooged""), this is a brilliant-and sadly necessary-social parable of modern greed and crassness that Dickens would have adored."
5,Bill Murray is Hilarious,Seriously one of the most underrated holiday films. I love putting this in the blu-ray every holiday season & just laughing the night away. I remember watching this with my parents and so many of the jokes went straight over my head. Definitely a movie that grows with you.
4,A classic!,"Great holiday movie, one of our favorites! You gotta love Bill Murray. The picture quality is really good in HD as well."
5,Best Christmas movie for a laugh!,One of my favorite Christmas movies. Puts an entirely new twist on Charles Dickens and what he really meant to say
4,Clever,"Don't listen to the nitpickers, this movie is a great holiday flick. Sure, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it's not, but the casting and the characters are great, and the contemporary setting makes it more accesible to younger generations. While it may not have the thematic impact of other takes on the classic tale, the message of the importance of brotherhood is illustrated throughout via Murray's character's interactions. And let's face it, Bill Murray is a really funny guy at this point in his career."
3,Scrooged,"Bill Murray is a great actor, this wasn't his best performance but its still was a good show, its for people born in the late 60's to the 80's. its a movie you could definitely watch more then once, once a year right before Christmas!"
5,Great Christmas Classic,This is especially fun for those who remember the 80s! Still brings a tear to my eye and I've seen it I don't know how many times.
2,Not Bill Murray's best,"Bill Murray may be the funniest man alive, in my opinion, but when I finally got around to watching Scrooged, I was let down. Not nearly as funny as I had hoped. Lot's of tired gags and it doesn't really pay off in the end."
5,Best Version of Scrooged,"Our family LOVES this movie, it's a classic as far as we are concerned. I love that we have it as the streamed version so we can watch it anytime anywhere."
4,Scrooged in a Murray,Love Bill Murray in this role. Definitely one of my favs. For 5 bux cannot go wrong! Watch it every year!
1,Never laughed once,"I figured since Bill Murrey was in this movie it was going to be hialrious. However, the movie was boring and not funny at all. I wish I never bought this dvd. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,missed the mark,"This unfunny,christmas carol satire totally missed the mark inmy book. It wasted talented actors with a really god-awful script.I didn't laugh once."
1,Skip This Turkey,"If you're looking for a movie to enhance the spirit of Christmas during the ""holidays"", don't bother with this joke of a movie. It's attempts at humor fall flat, and they're cheap attempts at that. It leaves you with nothing but a profound feeling that you've just wasted your time."
3,"A decent 80's movie, but doesn't hold up","Loved this movie as a kid of the 80's but doesn't hold up very well as an adult. Bill Murray is still funny in parts but his mean/nice/learning arc just comes across as silly and in the end the movie just felt like Bill Murray just walking around giving one liners.gotta say tho, the little boy at the end still tears me up and I even knew it was coming!"
5,A must-view for Christmastime!,"This updated version of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" is a must-see at Christmastime...right alongside ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."" The yucks are funny year after year and remain contemporary each and every time. The cameos in this movie, especially by John Forsythe and Carole Kane, will keep you in stitches...promise!"
4,Funny movie,"Very funny, we liked it. It was nice to watch at Christmas, we probably will do so next year as well."
4,"Give it another look, you will be surprised","I had not seen this movie in quite a while, but found seeing it in Blu-ray was a rewarding experience."
4,don't get better than the classics,"Love this movie. Definately recommend this to any bill murray fan, which should be anybody with a sense of humor."
5,A Dickension Bill Murray cult Christmas comedy classic,"Alliteration aside, Scrooged is in my must watch christmas movies. It's up there w/ Vacation and the other christmas comedies."
4,Scrooged,"Scrooged is a comical version to a classic Christmas story, A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. My family watches it every year."
3,Holiday Movie,"It was a humorous rendition of the classic, but the language is awful and unnecessary. Not recommended for young audiences."
5,Yearly tradition,For me this movie is on the list with Miracle on 34th Street. It is a must watch every year.
4,Still makes me laugh,The video and the style is aging as most movies made in this time frame but the story and acting are still very enjoyable. It is one of the few Christmas movies I can watch every year.
5,Classic,"This is funny and just a great all around movie. A great adaption or the original! You won't be disappointed .Wonderful actors , Bill Murray is very funny and plays his role so well.."
5,The Best Christmas Move EVER!,"Do not even bother reading this just do it. I have watched this movie 100's of time from a ripped dvd. Now I purchased the Blu-Ray and I promise you my son and I will watch it at least another 100 times or more. It is hard to explain. It will make you laugh, cry, get angry, you name it. This is directing at it's absolute best, a phenomenal achievement in film. It has Santa Clause with an Assault Rifle. Get this before it is banned!!!!!:)Order this now, please. The ***** hit me with a toaster......:) YOUL GET IT, YOUL LOVE IT!!!!!"
5,5 star purchase,Great old classic movie which i found at a very reasonable price and it got here very quickly. great transaction.
2,what utter garbage,"yeah while there were times of tenderness (the close-ups of karen allen, the scenes at Bill Murray's brothers home (of course reminiscent of Scrooge's own nephews feast), the film seemed rushed in every scene, especially the ending, after he finds out he didn't die, its just horrid. What was funny about it? Oh and what about the whole disgustingly rushed Ghost of Xmas Past scenes, I know 14 year olds who can do a better job at creating that Ghost and how unoriginal, I mean really. So far so original, but, those scenes, just deplorable. Ahhh with more Bill Murray's over acting in nearly everything he does, or the fact that the only really PURE Gem, was Carol Kane playing the fairy as Ghost of Christmas Present, she was just stellar. But sadly, nearly everyone's career in this movie went nowhere and for a reason, and if you think Karen Allen doing Indy stuff was stellar, well, I will give you that...."
1,How to ruin a classic,"The standard of A CHRISTMAS CAROL has been set back 1000 years. The movie is laced with profanity, adult situations and is in general bad taste."
2,Not Too Good,"I haven't watched this film in awhile but after watching it again it really isn't too good. I might have given it a two and a half rating but certainly no more than that. Technically it is a professionally filmed movie but that is not where the problems lie.I almost can't believe that there is a bad Richard Donner film out there because so many of his films are of a very high quality. Such as,Ladyhawke,Conspiracy Theory (Keepcase)andLethal Weapon: The Complete Series. But this one is lacking on story and execution. The characters are a mixed bag. I couldn't stand the ghosts or spirits and how they were carried out.Much of the comedy seems forced and Bill Murray, whom I enjoy very much in movies likeQuick Changeand the modern classicThe Man Who Knew Too Little, was at times, too over the top and his performance was uneven. There are some funny moments, but not enough and with all the flaws and uneveness I can only rate this 2 STARS."
3,Offbeat Christmas Present,"Murray is exactly what you expect. So if you want to see Christmas differently and not too heavy, this is a good choice."
5,"And she took our baby daughter, With Her!","great movie, what a great funny flic. we watch it every year and love the fairy she is the best."
3,Good for a laugh,I liked it because I like Bill Murray. Love relationship is not so believable. Scrooge with a twist. Great for a quick rental.
5,Extremely funny yet meaningful,"This is on the top of my favorite Christmas movies since I was a child perhaps even my favorite comedy of all time. This was an unusual movie. Although a comedy it had a certain seriousness about it. I think it had to do with a beautifully haunting score by Danny Elfman (my favorite work of Danny Elfman, too bad they don't make the entire score on cd) It is totally funny through out the picture. We laugh at how crude and nasty Bill Murray acts toward others because he is so funny the way he does things (like the part where he steals a cab from an old lady by tricking her and once in the car he gives her the bird). It is laugh out loud humor not just chuckles. But as it comes towar the ending we see how serious being mean can be. This is when Danny Elfman's score really gets your heart. And by the end you feel like crying and cheering at the same time."
3,good holiday fare,"This is a good holiday movie update of a Christmas Carol. I had to give it 3 stars as there are a couple of points where the story slows a bit and a couple of scenes where the special effects will scare younger children, but overall still a classic movie. Bill Murray does an excellent job of making you believe in his change of heart. Very well done."
4,Christmas comedy and drama with a king of humor!,"Bill Murray has never ceased to be one of my favorite comedians, from the first viewing of Ghostbusters to the outrageous role in The Man Who Knew Too Little. (He's also probably the only good part in Charlie's Angels, though I know most will disagree.) This film does not fail to further his career, in my opinion. It presented him as the crazed and vicious television company president who brings us an Ebenezer we can't ignore. Bob Goldthwait and Carol Kane do not fail to drive the audience bonkers either! Karen Allen is not AS convincing in her romantic role of Claire as she was as Marion in Raiders, but better than Laura in The Glass Menagerie. The humor is terrific in several parts (verbal and physical), yet the message of the film--the SERIOUS one--is not lost. This movie has made my Christmas for years, better than the two Home Alones! May I add, as an impending music doctorate, that Danny Elfman's score brings me joy with each viewing as well!"
3,Fun but not quite a classic,"If ""A Christmas Carol"" had to be recast yet again, this is one of the better treatments I've seen, but it's not without its weak spots. Bill Murray is good as the type-A Scrooge here, but to his credit he has a hard time coming off as a complete jerk.The supporting cast is good too, especially Carol Kane and Bobcat Goldthwait. The humor is a bit broadly played, to the point that Murray's conversion seems almost out of place and comes off a bit maudlin.Hopefully this movie will age better than Henry Winkler's ""An American Christmas Carol."""
4,Some funny Moments,"Some funny moments with a happy ending. Not for all ages, some humor is a little more adult. Not for someone looking for a deep movie!"
5,Love this movie!,Got this for my mother in law for Christmas. It's one of my favorite Christmas comedy's! If you haven't watched it you have to see it!
4,A Funny Movie,I love Bill Murray. He played it pretty straight with a dry wit in this movie. Love the message as in all Scrooge movies.
2,Not as funny as i remembered...,"Sorry just wasnt funny... and Bill Maurray is usually hysterical. Also, the scene at the end where Bobcat Goldthrait holds everyone hostage with a gun while Murray interrupts the live broadcast wasnt the same after the CT shootings... I would skip this one altogether."
3,I've always loved this movie...,...but the terrorist and gun toting at work is just too true in this century. I do love the movie but watching the beginning is tough.
5,Graet movie,I was very happy with this dvd. it came to me in great condition and I have watched it several time this year already.
5,Scrooged,A really funny movie to add to my collection. I watched it at the theatre several years ago and wanted to watch it again. Bill Murry is great in this.
4,A modern-day Christmas Carol,"Imagine Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol set in the modern world. That's what director Richard Donner and writers Mitch Glazer & Michael O'Donoghue have brought us. Instead of 19th-Century Britain, it's now 20th-Century New York City. Instead of Ebenezer Scrooge, we get Bill Murray as Frank Cross. Instead of sentimental drama, we get some satirical and verbal comedy. The only things that stays the same are the three ghosts, the Scrooge personality, and the definition of Christmas. I wouldn't consider this one of the greatest films of the holidays, but I will say that it works well as a Bill Murry comedy. There are dozens of funny jokes and plentiful sight gags that you can enjoy watching again and again. Overall, I'd say that this is a very good Christmas film and I did enjoy watching it, but please not that it may not be appropriate for little kids."
3,A feel alright movie,"Scrooged with Bill Murray is certainly supposed to be a ""feel good"" movie but only achieved a ""feel alright"" status with me. The retelling of the classic was competent, but did not bring anything remarkable with it. I am a fan of Bill Murry's work so it was enjoyable but not as good as I had hoped."
3,Fun Christmas Movie,This ia a fun Christmas movie. It is a nice alternative to the traditional Christmas fare but has a great message for all of us.
5,A Latin Student's Dream,I am in my third year of latin and this is the best latin book I have ever studied with. The common word pull-out at the back of the book accompanied by the commentary on the respective page of latin makes this the best latin text book ever.
5,Pharr's Aeneid,"This book is a great guide when translating the Aeneid. It has all of the poetic figures, grammatical notes, and vocabulary one needs for preparation for the AP Latin test."
3,Problematic Annotations,"I have found this text to be helpful, although at times somewhat misleading. Pharr's edition of Virgil's Aeneid is renowned for its extensive annotations throughout the entirety of the text (intended to assist students as well as intermediate translators). At times these annotations are more harmful than helpful. Many are either unclear or offer too much impertinent information. For this reason, students often miss the relevant information contained within and simply accept Pharr's translations of various phrases/words without actually translating for themselves."
4,VERY GOOD SERVICE,PRODUCT AS DESCRIBES. SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY AND ARRIVED SAFELY IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
4,A little above average with some incredible highlights,"Funny, people either love or hate this album. If you like aggressive rap you'll be among those loving it.If you like Fat Joe and Scarface you'll have to buy it just for the track ""Never liked yo ass"". Two incredible rappers united on one of the best tracks they ever produced on a dope beat.The list of appearances on this album speaks for itself. Other compilations have tought us that great rappers can make weak tracks too, but you'll mostly find good stuff on this one.This is the type of album with an underground feel that i've been desperately seeking these days. Not enough albums like this being produced."
1,Non Gangsta,I have one question for Kay Slay and that is y does he think hes a gangsta. The tracks themselves are about a 3 out of 10 rating but Kay Slay completely wrecks whatever he had going for him.
1,save your money,"what is this guy thinkin i mean hes absolutely horrible. i guess as the guy before said yeah he is really weak. if you are smart, do NOT buy this album"
1,hes weak,This has gotta be one of the weakest albums i have. I have over 200 rap CD's and this one is easily worse than ja rules pain is love. Thats all i have to say. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
4,Just as good as all the mixtapes he does.,"Well Kayslay has done it again. Most of these songs are off his recent mixtapes, but if you haven't heard his recent mixtapes you'll love it. If you have heard his mixtapes you'll hear some repeats but also new joints that are hot. It's well worth listening to."
1,Voiceover Hell,"This guy is the most annoying thing to hit the music scene since copy protected MP3's. I have one thing to say to this guy...let me listen to the song. I am sick of this guy talking over every song with his shots out to his brother, his first grade teacher, his Aunt Louis in Philly... It sounds like this guy just bough his first mic and needs to sing along with every song just to hear himself. Bad karaoke if you ask me. Just my 50 cents..."
2,"some good songs, but can't stand intros",When I buy a cd I expect it to be music. This cd is nothing more then some guy yelling over tracks and stupid skits. Don't get me wrong there are some good songs but it really gets old with the yelling. I just don't know where some would think it would be cool if he gave a shout out to his cousins RayRay and Shawanda in the middle of a song it's pretty lame. From a music stand point there are good songs but it's not worth the money I'm glad I bought mine used.
2,Disappointment,"With all the hype behind Kay Slay and this album, I thought it'd be a DJ Album banger like Clue's two studio albums or like Funk Flex and Big Kap's joint. Sadly, this ain't nearly what's really good. All the cameos from heavy hitters looked good on the back cover and made me cop it, but the CD is something entirely different. The best verses on this album come from new cats like Cassidy, J. Hood, and Joe Buddens (50's joint is good too). Those three did they thing. Platinum artists like Nas and Jadakiss and Fat Joe didn't come with they A-game. The production on this album is TERRIBLE. Only two songs on this album have bangin beats. So sad. Stick to mixtapes dunny."
4,AKA slap your favorite DJ!!,"It's obvious to most that the Drama King, DJ KaySlay, is the best mixtape DJ on the planet. This album is just another testament to his legacy, solid from beginning to end. There are a few songs I could do without (Seven Deadly Sins), but overall a worthwhile purchase. The best aspect of this album: KaySlay doesn't constantly talk over the beat like other DJ's, Clue and Funk Flex to name a few."
3,Illuminating but Repetitive,"I bought this book because I liked the author's essays in The New York Review of Books. I admire his razor-sharp intelligence and his fearlessness in tackling ""sacred cow"" subjects. This collection doesn't disappoint in that respect. But it covers the same ground over and over again. The essays are grouped by theme, so if you read them in the order they are presented you start feeling that the author is beating a dead horse. I'd say only about half of the pieces in the book are worth reading; the rest need only a quick skim. But the ones worth reading are REALLY worth reading. Get the book from the library if you can. If not, I do recommend buying it, but with reservations."
2,Maid no more,"The reviews for this book let it appear to be worthwhile reading. However, I have started to read it and so far covered 5% of the contents. It just didn't grab me yet and it has gone down to the list of books on my Kindle to be read. Maybe it will become more interesting later on, but what I have read so far does not make it an interesting book."
2,Save your money,"The vague and insultingly simplistic ideas on these cards inspire the opposite of creativity. Slick packaging makes for a pretty product, but the substance is not worthwhile; I'm returning mine. Maisel has a lot of worthwhile writing -- check out his _Fearless Creating_ if you haven't already -- but give this gimmick a miss."
4,looks cute,"Great looks! the front is slightly narrower than regular shoes. I wear 7 most of the time, and bought 7 for this style. So you might want to go 0.5 size bigger if you don't like the snuggling feeling. There is some cusion on the bottom, very comfy."
4,It's Greek to me ...,"This book is an excellent resource. But, you must be warned: it's written in Greek. I am someone who loves to do research, and I especially love to research the Bible, but this book is hard. You just need to know that. There are few English prompts or guides.I found exactly what I was looking for, but it was very time-consuming because it is written in Greek. I did a lot of cross referencing with an Interlinear Bible and Strong's Exhaustive Concordance with Hebrew and Greek (and of course, the Septuagint).But, if you are a die-hard studier of the Bible and want to cross reference some definitions between the Greek New Testament, the Greek Septuagint and the Hebrew Old Testament, this book is priceless. It holds some keys to obscure meanings."
5,Perfect chainmail pliers,"I use these (it takes two) for heavy gauge stainless steel chainmail. The handles are comfortable and it takes little effort to open or close the rings. I haven't used them for cutting, but for weaving they are perfect."
1,Rusted through in a month; Not Stainless steel,"This product rusted through in a month. There is this reddish build up and the wires are breaking because they have been eaten away by rust. The last one we had did not do this; it must have been real stainless, which does not rust. This one is a cheap knock off. I bought from a seller called LUCCA.Buyer beware!!!"
2,"great in theory, RUSTY in reality.","this bathtub strainer is perfect, in theory. it fit my old bathtub's drain perfectly and worked even better, hence the two stars. i didn't even care how difficult it was to clean, because i appreciated that the fine mesh caught almost everything. only problem is, it started rusting almost immediately. why would you make a product that's meant for use in water not be waterproof? i'm glad i paid so little for it, otherwise i'd be pissed. actually... i'm still pissed. because now i have to find another strainer. :("
1,RUSTS QUICKLY!!!! Does the job,"MAY 30, 2012: We have a sink in one bathroom that didnt have a plug in it at all. I bought this after my mom dropped a bottle of hair dye down the sink drain. It was easy enough to get out but after that incident i realized not everyone is going to be as careful as i am. This strainer is the medium size at 2 3/4 inches in diameter. The inner basket diameter is about 1 inch. It fits perfectly in my bathroom sink. The strainer doesnt lift when water is dumped in. It holds its position and the downward net allows the water to pull it down keeping it in place. There have been no signs of any rusting after about a month of use. I hope that continues to be true in the future.UPDATE: JUNE 20, 2012: Approximately 20 days after my initial review this product is showing signs of rusting. Disappointed, but it still serves its purpose. from 4 stars down to 3 now.UPDATE: JULY 7, 2012: It has completely rusted over and is utterly disgusting!!!"
1,Rust,This product rusts very easily. It took about 35 days to start rusting (of course right outside of 30 day return policy window)...
5,Great product!,"I'm so glad I found this product! I am a female with really long hair so you can imagine how much of that hair goes down the tub drain and clogs up the pipe. For years I had been using drain-o to clean the pipe about once a month, but then I purchased this mesh strainer and everything changed! It catches all the hair and is so simple to clean! I haven't had to use drain-o at all since i've had this product."
2,rusty after 2 weeks,Cool little screen but it is rusting in 3 spots after 2 weeks. Will not be usable in a few months. Was hoping it would last longer.
5,Works wonderfully.,I tried about six different bathtub strainers that cost a lot more than this gem. I highly recommend this one even though you do need to clean it after each use. I was having to use a drain product when the drain got blocked and never again is it necessary. I do keep several on hand for when I don't have time to clean it immediatly. Easy to clean with a toothbrush.
1,Basically junk,Way too flimsy for any real use. You can poke your finger right through the mesh. It began to rust within days after being exposed to water. Skip this one.
1,Not as advertised,"The Tub Mesh Strainer that this company sent was not stainless steel as advertised. Within a month the strainer rusted straight through and broke in half. If I had to guess, it was probably cheap steel painted silver. Buyer beware!"
2,Worked Great!,"This item worked great for about a two months. After a month it had rusted, I didn't care because it was doing it's job still. At two months the bottom had rusted clean through.Although, I feel it deserves a 1 since it's completely useless now; I will give it two stars because it's cheap enough that I was able to realize just how much hair females lose in the shower!! Before this item, I was confused on how the drain kept getting stopped up despite my usage of plunger and draino-like chemicals."
3,"Works, but ugly","This thing gets clogged up and ugly looking pretty quickly. You can clean out the hair relatively easily, but not the soap that starts clogging the mesh.It does the job, but it's not very girlfriend compatible."
2,All right for short term use.,This product seems to do the job well enough for a few months but in actuality it's only slowing down the clogging process. Within four or five months the drain is clogged so much that the bath fills with water within 5 minutes. By then the stopper is rusty and leaves marks when you remove it.
1,a strainer that won't seal,"Between a rock and a hard place. The Sinkware 5061 seals the drain but rusts in about two months; the Danco 8821 doesn't seal, nor does it rust. I guess its better to have a device that does its job for a little while than one that consistently doesn't work well at all."
2,Don't buy,"I was disappointed with this purchase. All the hair balled up inside the strainer, blocking the water from flowing through. Half way into my shower (about 10 minutes), the tub started to fill with water. It also trapped a lot of soap, which exacerbated the issue. When I went to take a shower the following day, the tub was very slippery due to the standing water/soap from the previous day. While I was more than willing to empty the strainer after each shower, it seems silly to have to empty it halfway through. It's not as if I suffer from excessive hair loss, but I do have long hair. If you're a guy or someone with short hair, this will probably be adequate. However, if you are female and have long hair and/or take long showers, then I would not purchase this product."
2,Not impressed,I'm not impressed by this item at all. it looks cheaper than other drains at the same price. it basically looks like a stainless mesh circle that was bent into a drain shape. prospective buyers should look to see if oxo makes tub drains. i LOVE my oxo kitchen sink drain.
1,Very Small....,Warning.....This is a very small strainer....measurements are stated but only use is for a tub drain and will have to empty it every day or even twice a day....
1,Catches TOO Much,"This does what it claims to do and keeps hair from going down the drain. BUT it also traps everything else too. After a week, it was slimy and disgusting with soap scum. I had to throw it out."
2,Holes very very small,"It is my fault I didn't take the reviews about the holes being tiny very seriously. I thought- what's the big deal? Well, for me it turned out I had to throw the show one out. It was so disgusting with the soap scum and slime - and having to rinse it out and clean with finger every day was not worth it. The product does do what it says - it catches EVERYTHING. I think I'll go for one with larger holes next time."
3,Mesh strainer,"Not what I thought it would be. However, if I had children, reckon it would be great in the bath."
5,more effective,"i used to have one of these in another apartment and left it simply because...who brings a bath strainer with them? i bought a plastic one that looked good and thought it'd get the job done. 2 visits from the plumber later, it did NOTHING to stop hair and completely backed up the drain. go steel mesh, it's worth it."
4,"Stops everything, but requires constant cleaning","its is a great product, but it does stop everything and requires constant cleaning so as not to stop water flow. it IS easy to clean and stops what i needed it to stop (hairs), so I cant complain."
1,Terrible--Soap Scum gets stuck--impossible to clean out,Fail. Hair and soap scum get stuck and cannot be cleaned out. Very irritating. Don't buy! The holes in the mesh are too small.
1,Very disappointed,"First of all, this screen was way too concave to fit in my standard-sized sink. The 2.75"" diameter was right, but I didn't expect the screen to be so tall. So I had to use it upside-down.Second, the screen rusted after just 3 weeks of use.Time to try something else."
3,cleanning is a hassle,"The mesh blocks everything very quickly. However, the holes are small and the size of the strainer is not large either, so it has to be cleaned very frequently and thoroughly which is not really great."
5,Works great,It's just right for my 1.75 inch bath drain. The center part is about 1 inch. It stops the hairs.
3,bathtub mesh strainer,"Fast shipping, great price. I like the strainer and it works really well but it rusted after 2 uses. I cannot get the rust off my tub."
2,eh!,"A couple of decent songs and the rest is just plain boring. They try to raise money for the Bridge of Hope, just donate and forget the music."
3,Interesting Curio for AC/DC completists,"This a modest, sweet, vaguely ""Band"" sounding recording from the early seventies (1971) perhaps notable for the appearance of Cliff Williams on bass. Some lovely guitar work, solid tunes, good vocals and a dash of mellotron makes this a worthy listen. Soon to be out of print, I expect."
4,rachel we hardly knew you,"It's been more than 20 years since I saw this film, in a theater, and I still remember it for Jason Patric's extraordinary performance, one I was convinced would establish Patric as the next great star.Then came Speed 2. And things came to a grinding halt.But having just read the book, which has to be Thompson's shortest (and tightest) I again remember Patric's performance. In the category of Eric Roberts in Star 80 and Mickey Rourke in Barfly. Maybe it's time Tarantino and Patric got together."
4,subtitles,"i only want to advise the customers that there are no english subtitles.nevertheless, this is a great movie to watch."
1,Didn't expect what I wanted to See.,"Its a ok movie,I didn't like it,I was expecting more action movie then alot of exrotic sex,some sex scene."
5,In which Brust predicts the mortgage crisis,"Wow. I just got into this series, and although I will agree that the narrative was at times less thriller-esque and more difficult to follow, it all but frames in relatively easy to understand terms, our current mortgage crisis *More than ten years before the fact*. Creepily prophetic. Thanks, Mr. Brust."
4,Another good Vlad novel,"I always enjoy reading Steven Brust, especially his Vlad Taltos stories. Orca is no exception, being a fairly basic straightforward story. However, I enjoyed the earlier Vlad stories better. I look forward to him finally rejoining his wife and resolving his many problems. It's a mistake to send him off basically alone against the entire Jhereg organisation, especially in such a multi-book setting. That said, this is still a good story and worth anyone's time to read."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Kiera the Thief is friends with Cawti, Vlad's estranged wife. She wants to know what he is up to, so Kiera fills her in, and a large part of the book has to deal with Kiera, and who she really is.Vlad is trying to get help for Savn from a local woman named Mother. She agrees, if Vlad will look into her own problem.He takes her up on the deal Vlad ends up in a private investigator type role, looking into some Orca financial skullduggery that could have very serious ramifications. This he does with Kiera's help."
2,I'm not too happy with this...,"I think the Vlad Taltos series is going downhill somewhat. I didn't much care for Athyra, and this one wasn't so great either. The return to first-person narration is a plus, even if it's only actually narrated by Vlad in bits, but overall the book REALLY dragged, with a horribly convoluted and dull plot that never really led anywhere. Only the most ardent Brust fans need check it out."
2,Vlad and Kiera investigate a business scandal,"In this novel, Vlad (assisted by Kiera the Thief)tries to help an old lady so she won't get kicked off her lands; a financial scam artist named Fyres has just died and suddenly everyone is panicking to sell their land. Vlad suspects that the Imperial investigators only pretend to investigate Fyres's death, and he tries to find out why. Vlad and Kiera take turns at telling the story. Reading about this financial tangle isn't very exciting...until you get to the last few pages - the final revelation will make you jump, I promise !"
1,King Lounger? King Dumper is more like it.,"Actually, this product gave me a good laugh today, although I wouldn't want to see a YouTube video of me trying to get on it in my pool. It looks cushy and stable, right? Like you could just settle in for the afternoon? Maybe if you're 18 years old, 5'1"" and weigh 95 lb you can. But not if you're an old lady like me--79 years old, 5'6"" and overweight. It took me about ten attempts just to get seated without being bounced off into the pool. Once I figured out how to mount the beast, I had to position myself VERY carefully in the middle, not shifting even an inch to the right or the left. Otherwise I'd get dumped again.I'll admit, it tickled me. But only because I was alone, in my own pool, with no one to witness the performance. And also because although it was money thrown away, it wasn't a LOT of money thrown away.How they can manufacture something so magnificent looking and yet so totally unreliable is beyond me.Caveat emptor."
1,Not Where It's At,"Hate to be the lone dissenter but I'm gonna be honest here. I became a Dels fan around the time of Twisted and Some Other Sucker's Parade. I'm sure I'm far from the only one in that camp. I picked up this album long ago (I've long since sold off the CD). When I gave it a listen, I thought it was a different band!I can't say the album's bad, it's just a completely different genre of music. More Elvis Costello-ish than the melodic alt-rock balladry of sorts that filled the later releases.If you're like me, a word of caution, this disc may not be for you. Buyer beware."
4,I never tire of this CD,"From the moment I put Disc One of this two disc set on my stereo, I was hooked! This music just jumps from the speakers, I start to dance, and I crank up the volume. The mix seems to bother some people, but its recorded in a hot hall in Texas and in my mind it adds to the enjoyable flavor of the experience. I play it in the car, so I'm not bothered by the sound quality, which, really doesn't bother me too much anyway. The songs, the lyrics, the band giving it their all...I sing along every time! Now if you want issues with sound, my sung versions of these songs are a real problem."
3,The mix is horrendous - bootleg quality,"Old 97's are among the best 5 bands in all of rock music. Their live shows are legendary. This CD, unfortunately, fails to capture that. And for one reason: the mix. You can barely hear Ken's guitar and he should be featured. New West should remix this and re-publish."
4,"Come On, Ken's Guitar at ear bleeding levels is a must?","I think everyone agrees that the band is a hot live act and I think this CD will be a wonderful introduction for anyone not familiar with the band. But, the mix is true to what you get live and what you get on most live albums. I hear Ken's guitar at a reasonable level throughout the CD and disagree that he should be featured. Yeah they could have bumped one or two solos up, but hey, often at a live show the soundman forgets that bump. What you get on this CD is all their best songs (sadly no ""Victoria""), fan favorites and deep cuts played with the kind of beautiful slop that would make the Stones proud. Now if you want some sheen and an overly mixed live album then check out Frampton Comes Alive or KISS Alive II."
4,Agree about the bad mix,"This is a great CD, and as a huge Old 97's fan, I'm thrilled to have it. However, it sounds like a good bootleg, not an officially released album. The DVD released earlier in the year is way more representative of the feeling of an actual show."
4,top book - rethink your way of management,"I have the full audio version of this book and have listened to it several times. This is a very thought provoking book that will challenge the way you think about leadership. It is well work the read. Highly recommend for business leaders, managers, pastors, or anyone involved in inspiring people to step up and be part of the solution."
5,Superior Sound,The sound quality on this collection is far superior to the Midnight Mover/ Ultimate collection.
4,"Overall good; I liked it fine, thanks.","It's missing one song that I like ""Sweet Caroline"" other than that it was excellent. It did give me insight into how prolific he is."
4,All the Womack tracks I wanted,Other compilations were missing one or two. This one had them all and a few I hadn't heard. Had to figure out how to read the digital booklet but that was nice too.
5,Marry Jeffers,I recently bought this CD and it is awesome! My sister came by and heard this with me. We played it over and overagain. I didn't realize Bobby was so multi-talented. Sorry for his illness right now. Hope God allows him to stay withus and continue to make us happy with his concerts.
5,Pliers won't pinch,These Stanley needle-nose pliers are better than most because they're designed so they won't pinch your index finger.
2,inadequate,"I tried to save a few dollars in purchasing a number of Stanley products....what a foolish mistake.....I should have gone with the better products (Klein, for example)....this is nothing beyond mediocre."
4,Great system,"I had one of these years ago and really liked it. I got away from drinking coffee so I stopped using it. My husband is a coffee drinker and I like iced coffee but it never tasted the same. I purchased this one and it makes great coffee just like I remember. The concentrate is particularly nice for iced coffee because you start with a cold product. Not like putting hot coffee over ice cubes. I only give it 4 stars because it seems a little pricey for a bunch of plastic. However, ""Made in the USA"" makes the cost easier to swallow."
5,no bitterness,I purchased my own brewer 35 years ago. Purchase this one as a gift for a friend who loves the coffee it makes. No bitterness in the brew.
5,"Kathy Van Zeeland Mega Watt Medium Satchel, Royal",Fantastic purse. This designer is the only one that I usually purchase from when it comes to purses. Her designs are unique and what I look for in a bag.
4,It does it work,"I love the color and the quality is pretty good for the price!! It totally works for me, I can fit diapers, creams, cologne, hair brush, and little stuff pretty well..the only little tiny problem is that it wrinkles a little so you have to fix it often but nothing annoing."
2,Electric Prunes - 'Just Good old Rock And Roll' (Collector's Choice),"As it (turns out) the first half of this lp was, indeed recorded by a couple of the original members of Electric Prunes line-up - but the second half was done by members of the Canadian band Chilliwack. I've heard about this {strictly for completists} later day Electric Prunes release, but I never thought any record company would bother to reissue it on CD. It's not all that terrible, just the very idea of tagging this disc as an official Electric Prunes record. Tunes here that I could possibly coax myself into sitting through again are ""Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers"", maybe ""Violent Rose"" and the semi-uplifting ""Sing To Me"". Listen to this site's provided sound clips before purchasing."
1,Just Horrible!!!!!!!!,All I can say is YUCK!!!!! This sounds like a really bad attept at Ted Neely trying to sound like Derek in the Dominos. This is not at all what I expected from an Electric Prunes album at all!!! I hated it! I thought I would hear the same types of things from their first album. If that is what you want this is not for you!
1,Avoid,"Stay away, this is not good music. Lousy harmony next to weak music.I own this album in vinyl as part of my ""collection."" I just ripped it to disc after not listening to it in years. Horrible, just horrible. It will not get listened to again. If it were not original 1969 vinyl, I would literally toss it. The review at [..] is spot-on and worth a good chuckle at their punch-line.Looking for good garage? Check out their latest ""Feedback!"""
5,Good read if you are interested in Vietnam.,Unique book on Vietnam. I bought it used. Did not care on condition. Served in the same army unit but not at the same time.
5,Just as I remember!,"I absolutely loved this show when I was younger, and had searched for it's DVD for a while. Well I finally received it a little while back and have enjoyed so much watching the episodes. The picture quality is surprisingly well (not like this show was filmed all that long ago haha) but with all the HD, Blu Ray, etc- it holds it's own.As for the mini controversy as to whether or not there is a missing episode, I cannot tell you if this is true or not. Mine has 13 episodes: DISC 1- 1. The Accident 2. Shock Value 3. Hoop War 4. Cold Day In Paradise Valley 5. False Alarm 6. School Dance 7. The Science Fair DISC 2- 8. Alex & Mom 9. The Feud 10. The Videotape 11. The Solo 12. Annie Bails 13. Road TripI'd say if you liked this show, or even if you are just searching for a clean/decent show for your little ones, this is a great buy!AND IF THE DISTRIBUTOR IS READING THIS- PLEASE, PLEASE RELEASE THE NEXT 3 SEASONS!!!! YOU WILL MOST DEFINITELY HAVE PEOPLE PURCHASE THEM!!!"
5,Secret World Alex Mack dvd season1,"Great tv show!!! I really missed it lots!! I havent seen it since I was a kid, and now I own it. Thank you thank you for having it amazon!!!"
4,Classic 90s nostalgia,"I was probably the only dork that was stalking the release of this DVD a few years ago. Now that a few years have passed since I first purchased it, I feel the need to review.Here's a little background first: I LOVED this show growing up. I wanted to be Larisa Oleynik back in the day. She's my equivilant of the modern day Miley Cyrus (just less trashy and more wholesome).Flash forward almost 10 years and the show is cheesy, but it just bring back memories of childhood. If you watched this show as a kid, you'll probably enjoy the first season. If you didn't, wait until seasons 3 and 4 are released, purchase the whole series as a digital download and stay in one rainy day to watch all the episodes."
3,Great show gets mediocre treatment,"It is great to be able to watch ""The Secret World of Alex Mack"" again, but I'm just a little disappointed with the DVD. The picture is pretty washed-out, and I've seen the picture break up at least once; this isn't the DVD's fault, but a problem during the transfer. Also, although this really isn't a big deal, the case incorrectly says that the show is in Dolby 5.1 (it's really just in the original stereo).I'm hoping that the remaining three seasons are released and that they're transferred from better sources. 'Cause this show is awesome."
3,Secret World Of Alex Mack,"This product was really good, what I don't like is that it lacked special features, and the episodes were out of order, but you can't tell since the episodes don't cross over. I would love it though if they put the rest of the seasons on DVD."
3,A Quick Cash Cow Oppertunity With A Great Show,"As a late 80's/90's child SNICK was a regular fixture in my house every weekend and ""The Secret World of Alex Mack"" was no exception. I was thrilled to hear when it was announced that the first season was FINALLY coming to DVD after almost 10 years since the finale. And then I got a glimpse of the cover art and boy, am I glad I didn't spend the money to get this show I loved. What a slap in the face to the wonderful and talented Larisa Oleynik's face by having her have to SHARE the billing with Jessica Alba (you can count the number of episodes she was in on ONE HAND!) Clearly the distributors of the DVD only wanted to cash in on Jessica Alba's popularity at the time of its release. Keep in mind I am not bashing Jessica but this was LARISA'S show and she should get the sole billing. Its a shame that it had to be like this because I would have bought this in a heartbeat had they not decided to become cash cows...."
3,JESSICA ALBA,the only reason i bought this isfor the three episodes thatjessica alba stars inI LUV HER
4,Nice 90's classic,"I really enjoyed this when it first came out. Back then, superpowers weren't such a big genre as it is today (Heroes, No Ordinary Family, Smallville, The Cape, etc etc)The story centers on Alex Mack, who is by accident splashed with a chemical that grants her superpowers. The owner of the company who produced the chemical now wants to find her (Alex manages to escape before being apprehended) so Alex has to deal with this on top of learning about and managing her newfound superpowers. She also has to deal with her sister, who sometimes treats her like a lab rat because of her powers. It's not easy being a kid who has to hide her powers from everyone else, huh? I really enjoyed this show, and certainly wouldn't have minded having powers of my own!"
4,It's about Time!!!,"i just don't understand why it took this long for the ""official"" release of this very fine show. my only concern is the treatment of the show. i was disappointed in the way the ""powers that be"" released WKRP, Providence and even Northern Exposure. i don't get why shows and music just sit on some shelf collecting dust when folks would be happy to buy the stuff. it took forever to get the Pretender on DVD and Freaks and Geeks. i must say if the folks who put out the Alex Mack DVD follow the example of the Freaks n' Geeks crowd it will be a great product. i want to show support for this effort but will probably wait till some actual reviews come in."
3,Lapidus for men,I did not like the smell of it too flowery for my taste it smells like some cheap imitations i've sampeled in the far east quite a disapointment .
2,lasts but......,"for something of this price range, the smell lasts. But the smell is not I am crazy about. Wont buy it again..."
4,Thanks !!,"Excellent, thought to be perfume as ...Ja had used some years ago, and had forgotten how much he has good smell.Arrived super fast, well packed and me and perfect!"
2,Sorry,"I recently purchased Lapidus Pour Homme and was thoroughly disappointed. The formulation must have changed in the years since I last bought it. The fragrance is not as rich and it fades very quickly. My disclaimer is that maybe my sense of smell might have changed, but I don't think it would have changed that dramatically. It might be a knock off, though I wouldn't have any idea how, the time, or desire to pursue that. I feel it is one of the hazards of remote commerce. The service and delivery were excellent."
5,Classic-- but please get authorship right Amazon!,"Watzlawick, Beavin, & Jackson's Pragmatics of Human Communication is an absolute classic as generations of communication students know. But generations of communication students and other readers also know that Dan O'Hanlon never had anything to do with the book. For some bizarre reason he was asked to write an introduction when the book was re-issued in paperback recently and now Amazon has listed him as a co-author. At best he's to be credited for a self-serving, misleading introduction. This is an insult to the original authors and to the spirit of this canonical work.I hope this mistake will be corrected. Meantime, ignore the error-filled introduction by O'Hanlon. This book really is foundational and needs no introduction, if for no other reason, because so much has already been written about it."
5,Beautiful,"My favorite fragrance at a great price!, comes without box but who keeps the box? First time I order this and will continue to order!"
2,Gift perfume was deemed unacceptable by gift recipient,"I sent this parfum to my sister-in-law who has used Estee Lauder's Beautiful before. She stated that this parfum was unsatisfactory, because neither she nor anyone at her Rehab Center could smell the fragrance. Even a heavy spray on various areas was barely detectable. She wondered if the parfum had been watered down."
1,Oder was faint,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she was disappointed with the smell. Although it smells like ""Beautiful"" the oder seems not as strong as the bottle she bought at Macy's. Kind of like it's been watered down if that's possible.Very disappointedd and will be paying full price at larger department stores from now on. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Misleading Info,The item does not come in a box as pictured and the size is far less than the .6 oz advertised.
1,Stinks,"I received a sample for this in store. A dab on my wrist was okay. But then, I sprayed this perfume on my wrist and neck. It was vomit inducing. I had a migraine for the whole day. I would never buy a full size of this product."
1,Beautiful by Estee Lauder,"I was not happy at all, have used this for years it was not the same.The box was not sealed,so I feel that it was tampered with the smell was awfull, just glad to get a refund . Thank You"
3,Beautiful Love,"I purchased this for Christmas and received Beautiful Love by Estee Lauder instead of the original Beautiful. The sents were different and there was no mention of the word ""Love"" in the offer. I thought I was purchasing the original perfume and felt like I was baited and switched. I expect honestly in advertising from Amazon and did not receive it with this product."
5,Beautifully Beautiful!,"My wife LOVES the smell of Beautiful! When the shipping is fast and you already know the gift is liked...well, it is all gravy from there!"
4,It Really Is BEAUTIFUL!,"I love the smell of this fragrance -- it truly is beautiful. The smell is very feminine and attractive. Just be careful not to spray too much because it can also be overwhelming, just because it is not a weak type of scent. This is great as a signature scent."
4,th;is movie is so hot its cool!!,"I watched it and was really surprise at how the plot thickened and kept me wondering what was gonna happen next. I ewas surprised that three people could hold it all together and each one were great!!Many surprises and Josh Brolin has really had a hidden talent thesre past years for he was fabulous in this --I daresay that is when he met his now wife Minnie Driver. It's very well acted, very well directed, and writing that will keep it on your mind."
1,NO Maxfield Parrish Illustrations!,"Publisher's description is incredibly misleading. This edition (ISBN: 1603128336) does NOT contain the original Maxfield Parrish illustrations. In fact, it contains NO llustrations. The reason there is no cover image on the product page is because there is no cover to speak of: just a plain blue cloth cover. Beyond disappointing!"
4,Excellent illustrator;Oz author; nursery rhymes into stories,"Maxfield Parrish black and white drawings complement L. Frank (Oz) Baum's expanded versions of the Mother Goose tales. Includes his versions of Sing a Song o' Sixpence, Little Boy Blue, Cat and the Fiddle, Old King Cole, Mistress Mary, Jack Horner, Man in the Moon, the Jolly Miller, Hickory Dickory Dock, Little Bo-Peep, Tommy Tucker, Tom the Piper's Son, Humpty Dumpty, The Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, LIttle Miss Muffet, and others. 1986 introducyion by Patricia Barrett Perkins. 265 pages."
4,great bed time book,This is a great little bedtime story book. If you've ever wanted to know the back story on The Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes this is the book. I'm not sure if its just his take on it but my kids love it!
2,If you take all of the rhyming fun out...,Is it still mother goose? Not to me. Jack is fast and is jumping carefully over the flame but without the rhyme it is not as fun.
4,Mother Goose in Prose,It is very interesting to read and it keeps your attention. The story about how the rhymes came to be is good.
2,Not so much-----,I love Twilight but this video was a disappointment. I didn't even know some of the songs and evenClair deLune was different. Sorry I spent the money.
1,Never Got To Watch,"Unfortunately, the DVD snapped in half while I was removing it from the case. Never got to watch it. Debating if I should buy a new one."
5,Twilight Sage Additions,Perfect addition to the Twiligh Saga collection. The videos are great addition for the songs list.Only changed I would have loved is to see some cuts video of the file in the video songs.
5,Sorrows for a Man Against Time,"There is tearing in this longing. Mishima and Genet haunt this LP with their lusts and decay. Of all DI6's albums, this one confounds me most. The soundscapes are evocative, threatening and brutal. Sometimes all three at once. ""Burn Again"" makes me think of immolation, martyrdom, and tortured christs dangling from meathooks. Blood saturates this LP and so does ruin. ""Blood Victory"" is what, exactly? An Aryan call to arms? An archaic ritual that only Douglas P is aware of? I think of many heresies whilst listening to this. Many delicate torments. I find it soothes the beast after a long days feeding..."
4,sturdy and easy to use,I got this exercise pulley for my Mom after she had shoulder acromioplasty in both shoulders. It is similar to one she used at a physical therapy facility. The mechanism is smooth and sturdy and it has worked well. The only thing that could be improved is if the door hanger was longer and the pulleys came out from the door further. My Mom is wheelchair bound so it's hard to get centered under the pulleys for her to use it.
4,Okay,"I like this product. easy to install but looks a little cheap... But then again the price point is well worth it, fast shipping"
5,great in my recovery,"I ordered these after looking everywhere in my town for a pulley system to aide my physical therapy. These are nice, adjustable and durable."
4,easy to use,"This is my first notebook. My dad gave it to me and i absolutely adore. it is cute and sleek and very easy to use. The screen is nice and glossy and is not at all dead. i like how the overall notebook is built nice and light and it does not overheat. when i first got the laptop i felt like it had no flaws at all, but i do have to say that the only weakness is the speaker. other then that i am very very satisfied with this laptop and would not choose another. I would give it a 4.5 star."
4,Value for money,"I wanted a laptop that I could use to organize my information and to take around for presentations. I have been using it for a week now and feel that it fits my needs very well. The battery life is good, the screen is fantastic and the size just suits my travel needs. The laptop seems sturdy but the keyboard is noisy and looks/feels very delicate. I didnt need a finger print reader and hated paying for it but it has worked fine for me so far. The extra large HDD capacity is also a plus with this laptop. Compared to other products from Sony with the same configuration this product is quite reasonably priced.The one thing I hate about the laptop is the extra programs that come installed. First of all it is hard to know what they are for and secondly they all boot on startup consuming memory and degrading performance. I am still trying to figure out which ones I can remove without impacting anything else."
2,Vista is not ready todo my work,"I love Toshiba product. I bought this model to replace my M55/S3293 which I had to return to my previous employer. I love everything that the U205-S5057 has to offer, light, compact and powerful. My biggest mistake was to purchase it knowing that it is pre-loaded with Vista which after 2 frustrating weeks I realized that it does not work with most applications that I need to do my work. Also, my broadband card from Verizon does not support Vista. Finally I returned the unit to Amazon which was easy to do. And purchase again from Amazon (shipped from Tiger) a U205-S5034 which has Windows XP. I am happy now."
1,Can't get it to run - tried 3 different computers,"I can't tell you if this software is any good or not, because it hangs on every PC I've tried. I've installed it on an HP, a Compaq, and an Intel dual processor machine, and it hangs each and every time. All three machines have powerful video cards, tons of memory, and the latest ActiveX drivers, but I cannot get the software to run. The best I can get is the ""ride coaster"" function, running in the lowest possible resolution, on one of the three PCs. The ""build"" function kills all three PCs immediately. I've run Roller Coaster Tycoon and Ultimate Ride on all these PCs with no problem, so I don't know what's different about this software, but it's a complete dud for me. The tech support is useless - all it says is ""get a better video card"". Not much help at all. Save your money, and buy Ultimate Ride."
4,A nice addition to your Blackjack library!,I love this book! Its an excellent book to read on the trip down to the casino. Filled with great text instead of dozens of tables. Definately worth it.
1,Moving Survival Guide,What a useless book. There is only one tip in the entire edition: Pack plates on their edges and bowls with the opening downward. Other than that there is nothing you can learn from this book.
2,not helpful at all,"She shows you her planning calendar for moving and actually has scheduled in ""recieve an offer on our house"" for a specific day""?! As if you could plan when this happens (if only it were that easy). She also refers more than once to how difficult her first move was when she had way too much stuff to move. Now she is careful to control how much stuff she has to make moving easier. That's great but for those of us a few months away from that first big move with too much stuff hearing how she got it all weeded through and packed up would have been more helpful."
4,Ultra Violet will get you dancing....,"As I wait patiently for the latest ""Bananarama"" album to be released, I always fall back on their classics to get me through....""Ultra Violet"" is a surpurb example of classic banarama tracks...Club Hit's such as ""Every Shade Of Blue"",""Prove Your Love"", ""System"", and ""Time Out"" are perfect dance beat tunes....Karen and Sarah are two gals who know how to get the floor dancing...Their music is as hip as they are...""Ultra Violet"" has the same energy as ""Wow""....another classic to add to your collection....."
3,Bananarama ultra violet,"if u like the sound of 90's electo style stock aiken and waterman, then u will like this albumi purchased it as i love the song take me to your heart, i was displeased that the album version isnt the same as the single version i give this album 3 out of 5 stars"
2,a serious misfire,"I LOVE Bananarama - have been a fan for almost 25 years (is that possible???). I have fond memories of driving around L.A. in a white Ford Mustang convertible while on vacation, a young 20-something in the early 80's, listening to ""Cruel Summer"" and thinking it (""IT"" being me being 20-something!!) would never end. Wow, the memories. These ladies have recorded some seriously EXCELLENT car music - WOW, True Confessions, Pop Life...... That's why this disc is such a major let-down. Whatever they had, it's simply not there anymore. They're just going through the motions. A major bummer. There's something to be said for retiring while one is at one's peak...... Overall, a very sad, depressing album."
2,POP LIFE was the last great Bananarama album!,I really enjoyed these girls. Though I think they are better off with a major label. YOU'VE REALLY GOT SOMETHING and I FOUND LOVE are the only songs that I liked from this album. Hopefully these ladies will get picked up by a major record label.....it will most definitely be a win win situation.
1,"Never thought I'd live to see ""anonymous"" Bananarama","Trendy production, whispered vocals and repetitious songs...this is easily the Banana's worst album, despite obvious efforts to improve upon the dancey material in their catalog. There's no reason why this album couldn't have been sequenced without breaks, because the songs largely sound the same. With the loss of their UK label and all the trappings of London's corporate identity, the Bananas sound like they're out on a limb, trying to re-prove themselves as performers. The group has always been at the mercy of their production team, but instead of infusing the songs with their trademark bounce and pop hooks, the material on Ultra Violet is methodical and tiresome. And with the exception of their loyal fans, I doubt that this album will be remembered by anyone ten years hence. Overall, a lackluster and tedious recording that only a dyed-in-the-wool BananaFan or disco dolly could find listenable."
2,"Historical only, really","Furtwangler is fine and Greindl is amazing even if you don't add points for his youth--mid-thirties! But Jaro Prohashka, well, sucks. He's the third-worst Sachs I've ever heard, better only than Fischer-Dieskau and Jose van Dam. He desperately needs a German language coach. Max Lorenz fails utterly to demonstrate how his singing kept him out of the concentration camps! His singing lacks line. I don't know what Herr Goebbels saw in him."
2,Poor common sense translation of systems science,"Beneath the shiny coating of words, the bottom line of the author is a poor translation of some of the fundamentals of systems science. The models presented in the book are none other than a banal reinterpretation of behavioural structures that have been studied by systems science for more than 30 years. Admitting this starting point and cutting a lot of the blah-blah about learning would have helped in making this a better book. If you want to read something on learning and change, read Watzlawicz's ""Change""."
4,The Big Picture,"This book is a definite must read for any person in a higher management position, but the principals that are dealt with can be applied by anyone. The main concept of the book is how we as people grow up dealing with situations piece by piece instead of looking at the big picture. It shows how if you look at an entire system you are more likely to truly solve a problem because you will see interactions between different parts of the system and how one affects another. It also shows how the solution to a problem can sometimes end up being worse than the problem itself. With out using systems thinking, a company will never be able to reach their full potential.The book can be hard to read at times but the information that is taken from it is priceless. If someone was to only pick up the book, and read a chapter or two, vital information can be learned."
4,execellent book for any manager,"Hello, I have read this book through at least three times and every time more truths stand out. I am a police officer and a pastor and this book has been invaulable to me. I read it through first, then I read it a second time using a high lighter to mark the interesting passages and then I read it again and was just as excited about managing and learning as I was the first time. This book teaches you to look at life as intersecting systems instead of isolated events and occurrences and fully explains why certain activities produce the outcomes that result from the choices that are made. I am a better police officer and a better pastor/teacher because of this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who manages anything."
4,The Fifth Discipline,"The seller said that it took 21 days to delivry to Bangkok, Thailand ,but I got my book less than 21 days wow. Thanks."
1,Management Speak 101,"Unreadable...Maybe he has some good ideas in this book, but I wouldn't know. I found his writting style completely unreadable. I found myself having to read chapters over and over trying to recall what I just read. The whole book felt like I was trapped in a never ending meeting full of middle management. Painful. I couldn't help feel like I was reading some lame new-age self help book.If you are already in middle management or above, you will probably think this book is fantastic as it reads just like you talk.But if you are in lower management or below and you see what's wrong with most company's mid and upper management, then you will find this book worthless."
3,Will this help?,"Will this help you make your organization into a learning organization, if you are NOT one of the top managers, and none of the top managers want to read the book or listen to your ideas?How well do the ideas in this book fare against apathy, ""not invented here"" syndome, and ""a prophet is without honor in his own country""?"
4,Solution for Learning Organization,"Peter Senge, in his book the fifth Discipline talks about the learning organization. As learning organization grows, it follows a loop feedback from them. The five disciplines that he mention includes system thinking, personal mastery, mental models, shared vision and team learning. The first three are related to personal issue and the last two are related to organizational issue. In this book he mention a lot of examples from his experience about learning organizations and their problem and also he talks about some mistakes that of the occur on learning organizations. I recommend this book for people who want to grow their organization and would like to know the solution based on Peter Senge point of view."
2,Simplistic Babble,"I'm glad I actually borrowed instead of buying this book. The approach was enough to keep me involved for a couple of chapters, but when I went to browse the appendices, I quickly found out what the ultimate drive was. In a nutshell,in problem solving, one should look for underlying barriers and dynamics. Treating symptoms does not necessarily solve the problem . . . No kidding? Anyone with half a brain can figure that out, it's the ""what do we do now"" problem that I believe is more important. This is where the meat is and where this book is woefully lacking. One either decides to engage their corporate culture, or merely go with the flow to their own peril in either case. Those that figure it out rise to the top, those that don't continue to kick against the goads until they figure it out. It really is a bottom line issue. I'm really scared to think of how many middle to upper level managers have read this book and actually said, ""Wow, I've never really thought of it that way!"""
2,A Re-hash of old stuff,"Waldrop's book is part of a widespread phenomena in business writing. Authors take some well-known information, in this case on systems and learning, repackage it and are hailed as ""path breakers."" There are a number of good textbooks that cover the same material much more concisely."
2,Unsure This Emperor Wears Clothes,"I wonder if this book often is held in high regard because it is supposed to be; because it sounds serious and informed; because it seems to be addressing a subject with gravity; because Senge must be saying something important because he's from MIT. I know no one who has remembered any of its lessons, much less applied them, , except its discussion of systems thinking---about which Senge says nothing new and takes pages to say it. This seems one of ""important books"" which, like the Emperor, lacks clothes.Granted, Fifth Discipline does looks impressive on my office bookshelf. But does anyone believe it has any other value?"
4,Combine your learning methods,To read the 5thD straight and apply it immediately is daunting - I suggest combining the books on tape with the book itself. (No I don't work for the publisher) The auditory explanation of many of the examples gives the reader a good foundation for attacking and using the book effectively.Working in the software industry we have found many of the priciples important in overcoming communication problems across the different types of people in the organization.Good Luck & Have Fun.
1,Audible.com Version Cannot be Heard,The Audible.com version of this book is proprietary and the conversion programs offered by the company do not work. The download process is not intuitive. The company is very slow to respond to customer inquiries and complaints.
1,Very Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio,"Like other reviewers, I also believe this book spends too much time communicating anecdotal evidence and far to little time discussing the primary subject matter.Additionally, the author appears to believe that everyone is made from a cookie cutter with exactly the same strengths and weaknesses, such that intelligent leadership, based on an understanding of people and how to motivate them as individuals, is not needed. The only leadership that is required, according to Mr. Senge, is someone to create the structure from which the ""Learning Organization"" will spontaneously materialize.Lastly, his overly simplistic, and thoroughly one-sided, examination of political issues is an unnecessary distraction from the material.I don't dispute that there's value to System's Thinking as a discipline, but Mr. Senge has failed to communicate that value in this work. You can obtain the same information without having to read this book by reading this review of it:[...]"
2,Good book for coaches,"I bought this book from a local library. It was difficult for me to understand everything because of the complicated physics laws. This book would be very good for a coach. But for an amateur swimmer like myself, you have to give it a second thought. I do not think English being my second language was a barrier to understanding the book."
2,Some overly-broad strokes,"Touraine's over-reliance on authors that are never mentioned makes it impossible for the reader to unpack his jargon. He uses philosophical terms like ""Subject"" and ""History"" without clearly specifying their conceptual origin, e.g., Hegel, Weber, Comte? Touraine is tying together too vast a territory, making it hard for the reader to untie the knots."
4,Good Compilation of 2 Classic Albums,I did not notice the lack of spectrum another reviewer discussed ad nauseum. And I have platinum hearing and quality sound gear.
2,"""The Dolphins"" Ruined","The combination of these two excellent albums is an idea that would have worked perfectly were it not for the ruined recording from a too-often played vinyl of the keynote song of the ""Marrying Maiden"" album, the wonderful cover of the Fred Neil masterpiece, ""The Dolphins."" What was recorded on this instead was an inexorably ruined-by-overplay rendering of this fine song. How unprofessional!Mike Metague6 Foxlair VillageMedia, PA 19063610.565.4901"
4,Grown Up,"Second chances are deserved and Tiffany proved how good she could be with this album, her voice seems to have strengthened over time and she's grown up (happens to us all).A more confident sound in all of the tracks, she's actually singing about something...tracks like Betty show how Tiffany should be much much bigger than she is, other stand out's are open my eyes, the in your face piss you off. If you like the sound of Alanis (now), Annie Lennox or Amie Miriello then you will like this album...I paid over $40 for it, no regrets."
5,Darn good music...,"I purchased this CD after reading the reviews, and hearing the one single ""I'm Not Sleeping"". I thoroughly enjoy the CD. The music reminds me of a combination of her older pop music with a harder edge, and a little Alanis Morrisette attitude thrown in. The ballads are pretty good, and the rest of the album holds up as well. It is a little disappointing that none of the singles have made it on regular radio airplay. A couple should have been Top 40 singles, if only the music industry had given these songs a chance. All just my opinion, of course..."
3,Movie tie-in edition of THE RATS,"James Herbert's novel from 1975 called ""The Rats"" became the movie ""Deadly Eyes.""I recommend Herbert's novels MOON and OTHERS."
3,Dafoe and Hines do the Two-Step,"""Off-Limits"" is a lush, lurid pot-boiler set in the smoldering sun of Saigon in '68. Dafoe and Hines, cops on the streets pack a gun where their conscience should be. Hookers butchered in blood, Dafoe leers at nuns, and Keith David shows up for a ""Platoon"" reunion; Fred Ward and Scott Glenn have a ""Right Stuff"" one of their own. Viet Cong get chucked out of planes, officers run amuck, and all dances to the beat of ""Sly and the Family Stone"". What more could you possibly ask for? ""Off-Limits"" is the twinkly smut dreams are made of. Christopher Crowe, God bless your soul!"
4,Saigon Beat,"""Off Limits"" has so much to recommend. Masterful direction by Christopher Crowe. Snappy dialogue. Willem Dafoe and Gregory Hines riff off each other so beautifully you would think they had shared a squad car for years. Good supporting turns by Fred Ward as the boys' superior, Scott Glenn as a kinky colonel, and Keith David as a promiscuous grunt. Dennis Washington's art direction perfectly captures the seedy decadence of Saigon. There is a big ""However"", however. The film's central premise involves an investigation into the murders of Vietnamese prostitutes. I don't think it will take you too long to say,""Ah-ha!"". Despite this film essentially being a mystery this should not turn you off because there are so many riches to be mined here."
4,A Much Needed Return,"I have long been a CK fan. I was happy to hear that she was releasing a new CD. It is hard to say anything bad about the greatest female ""pop"" songwriter. Overall I found the CD to be a welcome return. The greatest songs are the ones that she completely wrote: : ""This Time"", ""Safe Again"". The weakest one I found was ""The Reason"" (sounds a little too overproduced). The CBS collaboration sounds just a CBS song. If you are a true CK fan this is a must!"
2,Gave me the cramps,It it a coincidence that i got serious stomach cramps after listening to this CD. I got the sickies real bad.
3,IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY...,"... contrary to Amazon's product description, ""Where You Lead, I Will Follow"" is already found on the classic Tapestry album - in fact, I believe it's the very first track.Other than that, look at that CD cover - whoddathunk that an old Mother Earth hippie like Carole King had such a smokin' little bod???"
1,DISAPPOINTING!!,"I looked so forward to listening to this CD after seeing Carole King on the Today show a couple of weeks ago. I should have just been satisfied with her live performance on tv, and with listening to Tapestry. Probably the most annoying song on the CD is the track with Celine Dion...ugh. The majority of the songs feature repetitive, boring melodies, accompanied by the raspy shouting voice of Carole King."
5,Tremendous,I have long been a fan of Carole and have not heard such wonderful music come of her since the early 70's.....simply excellent. Too bad that in today's radio programming that this effort will not receive the airplay it truly deserves. Buy this disc.....you'll be glad you did.
5,Fabulous Collection,"Carole King just gets better with age! This is an incredible collection of her music. Some new songs, some classics. Energizing to listen to."
1,I'm speechless,"I really don't know what to say other than my dissapointment in the ""book"" is enormous! Unless Anne Rice was 13 when she ""wrote"" this, there's just no excuse. It would've been laughable, if I hadn't just paid a rather high price for it. A Collectible??? Hah! I laugh! A Dust Collectible, maybe.Lady meets vampire, immediately falls in love with him, he asks her ro marry him and share his eternal life, she agrees, he bites her. All in a matter of minutes! She's off to London with him to feed on those good folk while her brother stays behind. Large picture of her bearing her fangs. End of Story. Sad, sad excuse.Anne Rice has always been hit or miss with me, so I don't know why I'm so shocked at this ""book."" Sad, just sad!!"
5,Good Read,"Any Anne Rice fan will enjoy this short story. I have the new Kindle Fire HD and it doesn't support the video special feature advertised for this book , which is another reason why I initially bought it, this was a big disappointment."
3,Not One of Anne Rice's Best,"I plunged into this short story with high anticipation, but was disappointed (for the first time). Ms. Rice's books and short stories have never disappointed in the past, so I was quite surprised by the obviousness (and shallowness) of this work. However, I am now reading ""The Wolf Gift"" which I find somewhat redeeming."
2,"Kindle edition w/ video cool idea, but waste of money.","I downloaded this onto my iPhone Kindle only because it was something I hadn't experienced - a book with added video. It could have been great, but the book itself was awful. So, so short and not entertaining at all. It's like reading a short poem (minus the rhymes). I can't even list what it doesn't have, because it was missing everything a fiction should have. I think someone was just trying to experiment with cool new features on the Kindle, asked a famous author to whip them something up to accompany it, and there you go! $5.59 please! Say, ""No, thanks!"""
1,Are you kidding me!,"This whole thing must be a joke! First of all the ""Vook"" thing is completely non-existent. At the beginning of each ""chapter"" there is a speel about this video content not being supported on Kindle. Well, guess where I bought it! The Kindle store! And guess what I'm reading it on! A Kindle! Why oh why is this Vook offered at the kindle store for Kindle users!!! It's not a Vook, just a plain old short story and not a very good one at that! (And I am a die hard Ann Rice fan! I mean, I read everything no questions asked!) Second, do the editors think readers are a bunch of blithering idiots? At least in my version there were certain words highlighted which when clicked on took you to an online dictionary! Are you kidding me! Finally, the story itself is week and shallow and very disjointed. A definite disappointment. I think I'll just forget this whole fiasco ever happened!!!"
1,Disappointing - Audio/ Video DOES NOT WORK at all on my PC,"I was extremely disappointed as I purchased this not only to read the Story but to Enjoy the Audio/ Video portions as well. Unfortunately I could not get either Audio OR Video to work on my PC. In reading through the Reviews/ Comments it appears that the Audio/ Video portions only work on 'Apple' products. It would have been nice if that Very Important Fact would have been noted in the information provided to prospective purchasers! As for the Story itself- it could have been great but it was WAY too short -even for a 'Short Story' and the ending was very abrupt. This Short Story seemed more like the 'Teaser' that one might read on the back of a Book or in a review of a Book. Nevertheless, the imagery and 'mood' were CLASSIC Anne Rice -and why we all Love her!"
1,Need book,I need this book for class on my kindle FIX PROBLEM ASAP. Its really annoying me how Im not able to get it! please help me
3,It's an intersting read for the day,"From the reviews I expected a bit more from this book but for $14.95 and a DVD, it's decent. Some of it was fluff, but not all. They gave a few tips here and there on just about everything. But I would have liked to have seen more recipes in the book for both food and natural beauty products they make. I also wish they would have included photo illustrations for clothing, hair and make-up tips. Acutally I wish they would have included more make-up, hair and fashion tips period. The diet section was very basic also. That's how I would sum up this book, very basic."
2,don't like this book,"Amazon asked me to review this product. If I don't like a product, I usually keep myself shut up. Since I was asked, here is my brief view. I spent an hour and finished the book, nothing very exciting, informative or new to me. The DVD sucks. It's nothing spectacular. Don't understand why I was recommended this book by Amazon or other readers like them."
4,The Belly Way isn't about Bellydancing,"Barring the DVD workout included in the back of this book, it is not about bellydance. It is about using the performance techniques of a bellydancer to improve yourself. This includes eating right so you have energy to perform, the idea that you are never out of the spotlight as long as you are seeable, and other important tips. It is well put together and very personable. I enjoyed reading it and applying some of the tips and tricks."
5,send these in with daycare,"I love these disposable bibs. They are cheaper in price than bibsters, and just as sturdy. Maybe not as large. They work great for transportation, or for daycare. I send these in with my children, at school. Great alternative to the plastic bibs. I would say this is a must buy."
3,Ok in a pinch..,"We picked these up when we couldn't find the brand we usually get. First the pros: They are a good size, and the pocket is great - the pocket is designed so you flip it inside out, which makes it stand out a bit and thus its great at catching crumbs. Now the cons: The only thing holding them on is a sticker at the back -- if you have a girl it is really hard not to get her hair caught in the sticker when you are putting it on, which means her hair is caught up and getting pulled when you take it off. The cry factor for my daughter means that we will not be buying these again. The stickers aren't great - so if the kid manages to get the bib off, the sticker won't hold if you put it back on. My daughter figured this out and would take them off screaming as it pulled her hair. There is another brand of disposable bibs (made by a company who makes diapers..) and they have a velcro closure. We'll be going back to those- just wish Amazon carried them w/ the subscription service."
3,disposable bibs,"Great item for younger babies! However, we bought for our 8 month old granddaughter & she reaches up, tugs, & they rip right in half!! Not sturdy for an older baby!"
2,not good!,although its few dollar cheaper than pampers bib but never go for it.pampers can be used for more than one time if not dirty but this is not.would not recommend.
4,Best travel bib I have found,"I have primarily used these travel bibs until I recently tried Bibsters. I quickly switched back. I like the crumb pocket design. It holds well and catches food. The neck closure has positives and negatives. It is a sticky seal. As long as you press it together well, it holds well. My daughters pull on them, but quickly stop when they can't rip them off. The problem is they have long hair and no matter how hard we try, we end up pulling their hair. We put the bibs on in front (under their chins,) then twist the bib around. After they eat, we rip the bib to remove on the side, rather than trying to open the seal. This has reduced the hair pulling, but we cannot seem to keep it from happening completely. Overall these are my favorites. We have not had any issue with food leaking through the bib."
3,okay,"i like the convenience of these, but the adhesive part doesn't stay on as well as I would like. Im still trying to decide if I want to purchase them again. I've only used a few so far. But, the value of these is much better than the Pampers travel bibs."
5,What they SHOULD teach you in school...but don't,"While most career centers show you how to write a resume and tell you basically not to pick your nose in an interview, this gave me the straight scoop on how to get in doors and what to do once I got the job. I still use it as a handbook. Awesome for your first job."
4,Terrific book for young career minded people,"This book has helped me quite a bit. It reinforced conventional career wisdom like ""treat everyone well"" and ""accept any position to get in the door."" The book also gave me new ideas. I began reading more than the local newspaper because of Bradley and this has made me a much more educated worker. He recommends reading the Wall Street Journal and USA Today everyday. He also gives lots of credit to those who came before him and I really like his reading list at the back of the book. I read many of those books which also turned out to be terrific for me and my career. Scratch that - it has been terrific for my entire life! Get this book now. It is well worth the price."
4,Good reference for first-time job seekers!,I found this book to be quite enjoyable and easy to read. The author gives examples of other people's past mistakes (including his own) and successes. Richardson gives great tips and an overall summary of how to go about landing that first job and what to expect once you start. I have been working at my job for one year and still refer to it from time to time. I highly recommend this book.
1,steaming smuggness,"This guy writes on an 8th-grade level, with the insights of a sixth grader. A poor effort"
1,Very poor book with little to offer,"This book offers very little to the twentysomethings that it purports to be catering to. The author has little first hand knowledge of job search, but he draws out to great length what little he knows (which is nothing more than any other twentysomething already knows). Follows the ""I did it, you can do it too"" approach. If I was looking for a story about an egotistical marketeer finding a job, I would read the business section.Don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame!",All flash and no content. What a waste of money!The author's approach is demeaning and insulting to anyonewith any level of intelligence. The book panders to thenaive--I threw the book away.
1,Bradley Richardson is a fake,"I find it interesting to read the above comment that BradleyRichardson became ""President of his own company"" at age 28.Truth be known, he is president of his own company, but itis just a company for hawking his book. He didn't getpromoted into the position, he simply appointed himself.Not exactly the kind of ""up-the-ladder"" career success thathe's trying to convince you of. He's basically a fake whois trying to sell a book with little or no experience on the""I'm just like you"" line.There are much better books on the subject. Save your money."
1,Not as Advertised,"Blume merely shows one side of a first love. In the book, there is very little description, particularly of deep emotion. Katherine and Michael have no heart-to-heart talks, and it's difficult for the reader to see why they all of the sudden love each other. Mainly the book focuses on the sexual aspect, which is NOT what first love is all about. I went into this book thinking it would show the emotional side of a first love, the scary leap that one takes when they give themself to someone else emotionally. Blume only tells of the leap of giving themselves away sexually, and it was not what I was expecting."
4,A Must Read for Anyone 14 and up,"Judy Blume's approach to teenage sexuality is honest and refreshing. I have to completely disagree with all who said that it was disgusting. This novel was, in my opinion, not very graphic at all. Certainly, it was extremely mild compared to any romance novel. And since when has sex and first love become ""disgusting""?I recommend this book to any teenager, male or female, although I think females would identify more. It's amazingly realistic and true to life. Every teen can relate somewhat to the characters. I don't think that Judy Blume is trying to promote sexual activity in teens. She just tells it like it is."
5,Very good book,"I read this book in 7th grade (eeks!). It is VERY descriptive, but it is a wonderfully written book. I recommend it for girls 14+."
3,Disappointing,"i really wanted to read this book after i saw some good reviews here, the 4.5 stars it got and also read the excerpt, but when i got it and read the whole thing, i was kind of disappointed. the style of the book is really too much like the sweet valley books i had stopped reading a few years back (i had never read anything by judy blume) because i outgrew that. but other than that, the story wasn't too bad, though i was also doubtful to believe that after what kath and michael had had, they didn't even bother to try working it out. how that relationship ended and how they acted towards each other afterwards is very similar to what i had when i was 12 or 13, and they're 18 in the book. i'm 15 and have slept with my boyfriend of almost 2 years, and although we often have disagreements we consider ourselves as best friends (which kath also said about michael in the book...), but maybe i'm just lucky for now."
1,Inappropriate,"I think that Judy Blume should really label her book for teens and for kids. When I first picked up this book I was 11 thinking that it was another one of her fun and cute ""Fudge"" books. However I was horrified that the book was centered around sex. Now when I go back reading the book, I think that it is perfectly fine, but I think back when I was reading the book and realized how unsuitable it is to read at that age. Children pick their own children authors they like, just like adults. So Judy Blume should stick to her children books or clearly mark ""FOR TEENS"" on the front cover in bold letters."
3,Juvenile,"Im 26. So just to put my review in perspective.But, I really thought this story was plot based. There was really no symbolism, no deeper meaning, nothing. A led to B which led to C which led to D. I thought the characters were really flat. There could have been so much more insight to a ""first love"" relationship than just ""Hey! Should we do it yet? Or whole relationship is based on whether we do it or not."" Which, yeah a lot of relationships are ... but there was no writing about the letdown of guards we all put up, or the awkward moments afterwards, etc. It was just ""Let's do sex. It kinda hurt."" - very plot oriented.Morality wise, this book ""supports"" premarital sex. Just thought I'd put that out there for women trying to buy this for their 17 year old daughters.Judy Blume has done better.Fast read, though."
5,The best written heart touching book I've ever read,"I first read this book when I was 13. It made me laugh, it made me cry. i would recommend this book to everyone who wants to read a beautiful, sweet, heart touching story of young love."
3,An OK book,"Forever is one of those books everybody keeps talking about. Most people pick it up because of the sex but that really isn't what the book is about. Yes, it has explicit sex scenes and for those of you trying to avoid that, there's your warning.Overall, the book is dated, the characters naive, and the plot unrealistic. Then why read it? Well, it does give some interesting insight to love even for grown-ups. Adults tend to forget how real romance can be the first time and even if its obvious that it isn't going to last, well, you still want it to. Seriously, who doesn't want everything to work out in the end?So, anyway, even though it has many flaws, if you get a chance pick this book up."
5,A must read,"Wow this was a really great book. Once you start reading it you just can't put it down. It has a wonderful story line to it and u might learn a thing or two? Infact, I read it with in a few hours and then my friend read it and then before i knew it the book was being read by a bunch of other people at school. Actually some of them were walking down the hall way with it open, and fighting over who was gonna get it next! That must tell you something considering me and my friends arent the type that generaly read! Be sure and read it its really really good!"
5,Amazing,Loved it. I felt like I could relate to the story. There were very intense yet sweet parts. I think it's a great read.
5,good book,I loved this book I am only 13 so this was my first adult book I found it kind of sad but verry graphic and sweet I can't describe how the book made me feel but during the book it made me think hey i wanna have sex and oh that sounds like fun you know? But by the end of the book i was thinking I should wait. definetly a good book it makes you wanna wait for the right person!
5,Great book,This book helped me understand more about relationships. It also makes me think about things twice before I actilly decide on doing them. Judy Blume did a fantasic job on writeing this story. I did't want the book to end. I recommend this book to all teenagers.
5,Being a teenager I loved this book....,"I am a teenager and I read this book beacuse for an english project we did a research paper on an auther. I chose Judy Blume and read about the book Forever. After hearing about it I couldnt wait to read it. I started the book the Sunday I got it and finished it after after 3 hours. I could not only completely relate to this book but it helped me make wiser desisions about what I do. I loved Forever, and every teenager mature enough to handle the sexual content should also read it!"
5,I cried!,"I cried when a certain someone died in this book. But i thought it was awesome, I finished it in a couple hours. Judy blume is an amazing author And Im almost done reading all her books. I reccomend this book highly"
1,This book is not appropriate for most teens..,"I feel very sad when writing the review for this book. I can remember being an impressionable, and curious teen, when this book was placed in my hands some 20 years ago. I can tell you that many young women I knew became sexually active at a very young age, due in large part to this book. It made sex seem 'hip' and 'cool'. The saddest part of all is what this book says about our culture...which has cheapened a beautiful act between a husband and wife into a poor imitation.I would not recommend this book to any teen, especially ones who lack parental involvement in their lives. I believe that all parents should pre-read this book before allowing their teens to do so."
1,Tabloid Entertainment,"This book has and had one goal: to sell copies. The author exploits teenage curiosity about sexual matters in a way that validates the ""feelings"" of most young teens -- feelings that they want to have sex, to be physically intimate. But guess what, folks, following your ""feelings"" isn't the right way to live. Somebody cuts you off in traffic -- what do your ""feelings"" tell you to do? RUN 'EM OFF THE ROAD. Should you do that? No. A teacher gives you a bad grade and kids at school pick on you. ""Feelings"" say: blow up the school and kill the teachers (remember Columbine?). Should you do that? No. Hormones produce ""Feelings."" Love is a committment based on a choice. Love doesn't appear anywhere in this book. ...."
1,didn't like it at all!,"I did not like this book at all. I may only be eleven but I'm mature enough to understand this stuff. Katherine is just lucky that she didnt get pregnant or get HIV. This book I also thought was extremely weird I mean take a look at Michael he named his Di**,Ralph. I do not reccomend this book at all!!! next time I choose a book I'm looking at the back cover and not just read what judy Blume wrights!"
2,Okay....,"I like that this book tackles teenage sex, because parents, like it or not...if you're teenager is in love, they're probably doing it. However, the author fails to write about the more romantic aspects of a relationship (i.e. dinners together, long deep talks, similar interests). These two kids may love each other, but it's a physical love, nothing more. Without sex, I wonder what these kids would be doing?????The idea of them using birth control is wonderful. However, it does fail to mention the use of condoms after she gets the pill. They still need to safe-guard against stds, she may be a virgin. But he did say he had VD last summer. You never know.All in all, if I had a teenage daughter, I wouldn't mind her reading about sex, as long as it was related to a true love relationship with birth control. This book does not present a well-balanced relationship."
3,hmm...,well ...this book is clearly all about sex. i remember reading this in my library time in middle school..i think i was in 7th grade...i remember sqirming in my chair and looking around to see if anyone was looking at me! i got halfway through it and stopped...but i dont remember why i didnt finish itlol
4,I wish I had read this as a teenager!,"I first read this book when I was 28 years old because I didn't realize it was for teenagers. Due to some of the language used, I'm not surprised to learn that certain fanatical people have fought to ban it over the years. But, it's a wonderful story for adolescent girls and I feel they SHOULD be allowed to read it. It will make them think and it could possibly help them make better choices regarding love and sex."
2,Disappointing.,"Although this book is a bit dated, it is totally trailblazing material . No one was writing on this subject for teens in the 1970's . Known for her controversial books, I have found most of Judy Blumes's books to be exceptional. Forever lacks a strong ending, the story builds and builds then fizzles, and for that I must give it 2 stars."
3,It was OK......,"I bought this book yesterday, and I read it all in 3 hours. It was a good book, not GREAT but good. And I don't agree with the people who said this book was gross and perverted. Sure the sex scenes were a little graphic, but it's no compared to the scenes they make in movies these days. It was a great story about first love, and it made me wonder if sex is always necessary in love. And now I'm worried about what might happen if I get a boyfriend. Would I go through the same trouble as Kathy did? It really got me worrying, but it made me get ready to see what having a boyfriend is like, and made me decide to wait for the right person. (Theo, in this Kathy's case) And I have to say that I completely agree with Kathy's dad. You have to keep seeing a lot of people , so that you'll know who is the right one. Kathy was too young to be tied up with one person. I think this book will be the best guide for girls who are just before that age of having boyfriends."
1,Not Much Interest Here,"This book just didn't have a lot to recommend itself. It's the kind of book I would have read as a young teenager, purely for the sex. Katherine is a bland, lifeless character, and Michael is nothing but a desperate for sex loser. I kept wishing Katherine would tell him to back off. What's so romantic about a guy pushing a girl to go farther than she's comfortable with? Didn't he have any feelings of tenderness or consideration for her? Any respect? That's not ""love,"" it's a typical horny teenage boy. The bottom line is that aside from the sex, there's really not much of a story."
5,End Of Innocence,"This book offers a very in depth, explicit, and at times graphic realistic view on teens and the so called ""first time."" It doesn't fool you with cheap characters or dramatizing story line. This book is more based on the harsh reality that is teen sexuality. I guarantee once you've read the first chapter you will never want to put it down. Katherine (the books main character) falls into the world of love with Michael and share love like typical sexually active teens would. But we are introduced to a new love interest and Katherine finds herself in a twist between two boys. One she loves, and the other she wants. This book has been banned and targets for many censorship laws in local schools and was banned from some of them for sexually explicit material. But that's the good thing about it, it offers reality instead of fantasy, this book is real life from a teenage girl's point of view and I recommend it for all teens interested."
4,A Wonderful Coming of Age Book,"From the first page of the story Blume hits you realism. Throughout the story the main characters are faced with conflicts. Early on in her relationship Katherine must struggle with the decision of whether or not to have sex with Michael. Katherine must fight against her own desires and peer pressure. Katherine also has to struggle with her desires for another person as she is dating Michael.The story is told from third person point to view and because of this we are able to see everyone's true thoughts and reactions. Forever would be great for classroom use because of its realistic look at teen dating and sexuality. But, the book may also cause some controversy for the instructor and the school using it. Before using this book, the instructor should use appropriate judgment and evaluate their individual situation."
3,Kind of Adult . . . . :-/,"I got this book because it was suggested to me since I love all books Beverly Cleary. I thought ""Maybe Judy Blume is similar."" NO WAY ! ! ! ! Beverly Cleary is more for my age. This book has a lot of parts that I had to skip over and It made me sort of confused since I kept skipping so many pages. This book is more for grown - ups and I've decided to stick with Beverly Cleary. The book arrived on time and was in perfect condition."
5,Excellent Read!!!!,"I read this book when I was in Junior High and could not put it down. I loved it so much that I recommended it to all my friends! They all loved it! I was lucky to have a mother who was open-minded enough to allow me to read this at a young age. Needless to say, my copy is well worn. I have re-read many times and get all emotional, remembering my first time for all the things Katherine and Michael go through. I recommended this book also to my stepdaughter when she was in High School. Now we have my old tattered copy and her slightly less tattered copy in the bookcase. Although it is a book for a mature person to read, I would recommend this book to all young ladies and anyone else who would enjoy such an awesome book. It puts into perspective what young ladies are facing in the coming years with boys, sex, and female issues. Judy Blume knows how to tackle a delicate issue so well."
3,"Cute, Cute, Cute ...","Cute. Cute. Cute.First of all, can I say, I really like Judy Blume ... she's very open and concise. I like the way she endeavor to teach her readers with a good sense of humor. One of my favorite, middle age reading is, Are you there God? It's me Margret! It was a fun, quick read and I loved it. She does the same with Forever too. Hilarious, cute, and rational!Katharine and Michael's relationship is kind of matured--the way they make a grown up decision, express their love to one another, and how Katharine takes responsibility for their action makes it very mature; however, they've a kid voice in each of them. (I had a hard time picturing them as a senior.) I'd say they (Kath and Michael) taught teenagers should be accountable for their action, make decision, and love one another in a way most teenagers don't.Overall, I think this book was sweet, entertaining, and adorable. Judy Blume is great."
5,Good book to give to a pre-teen,"The author wrote this story in a way that relates to most teenagers nowadays, that is, how they meet the opposite sex, like each other and eventually become boyfriends and girlfriends. It's just so much like us! I've been reading Judy Blume's books since young and believe me, this is the first book that taught me sex-ed!!!"
5,This Story Had a Profound Affect on Me,"Unless I'm mistaken, I read this for a class way back in 1973-74 while I was in high school. The story had a profound affect on me after reading it. I was still a virgin, but madly in love with a young man with whom I gave my trust and eventually my virginity.It was a painful mistake for both of us, but in the end, we both met our forever loves, married, and are still married to our true loves to this day.This book is pertinent to this day. I wish it were still in print. It helps young people to think about life-long choices and consequences."
2,Like New!!,"I wouldn't of cared.. but when a product says like new, that's what you're expecting. The book showed up with nail polish on the cover, big spills of liquid foundation on the pages, and marker written and highlighted on multiple pages. I don't think the seller should be able to put like new, when the book is in that kind of condition.However I did receive the book in a timely manner and my daughter did love the story."
3,Detail!!,"I mean I love it but there's no details at all! I'm asking a lot of questions like,""what happened to Arthur?? And how did college go and what did Theo say? Other than that it was very entertaining and kept me reading"
3,What???,"This book was really strange, because it jumped right into the story. By the fourth page, the two main characters were already a couple, even though they only met on page 2. By aroung page 15, they were already practically having sex, and there was basically no character development whatsoever. Lots of dialogue kept the story moving, and it was definitely a quick read (I usually am a slow reader because I read every sentence twice due to distractions), and I read it in a little over two hours...a record for me. It definitely had a story line, but it lacked depth. I was never bored, but I also wanted a little bit of insight into the characters, rather than just what they were doing and saying. It was a quick summer read, but I was not sad for it to end because I felt no attachment to the characters while I read it, and therefore I did not feel connected to them."
1,Real Review,"Okay, so I am a 17 year old senior in High School and I thought this book was terrible. Forever by Judy Blume is written in the style of a 10 year old, yet deals with sexual situations that belong in porn movies. The storyline was weak, and the relationship between the two main characters was strange and unhealthy. I do NOT recommend this book and I literally (no actually) threw it out after I read it. It was that bad, and I didn't want anyone to know that I had read it. ( i just want to prepare you because it had no story or relationship, and was mainly about awkward sex, written for middle school level readers (which did not make sense))"
4,Entertaining,"This book was entertaining, although i found it a bit too descriptive in some parts.The story revolves around Katherine and Michael, who meet at a party on New Years, and continues until the summer. I think that this is a good story for teens, but it should have some kind of warning on it since it is innapropriate for anyone under 15. A lot of the story is almost pornographic."
3,YA not children's,"Judy Blume's books for children are wonderful and uplifting, so I was surprised and shocked by this one. Forever is a book about sex, abortion and other things meant to be controversial not uplifting or funny - clearly making it a book for older teens and not a book for Blume's usual audience. Although the book was a good read, it's a little odd to be honest. The ending was sad and unexpected."
2,I can't believe I used to love Judy Blume,"Oh, Judy...you sure did pull the wool over my eyes. As a middle-schooler, I read almost all of your YA novels and loved them. Now, as a more experienced reader, I realize just how mediocre your writing is. Please forgive me for this review, but, seriously, this is not literature. Plus, it's rather outdated, and I can't believe people are still shocked by the contents...Seriously, your kids see worse things in the corridors in-between classes. Anyways, I say steer clear of this seventies throwback and read Doing It by Melvin Burgess or Blankets by Craig Thompson instead."
4,mY tHoUgHtS oN fOrEvEr,"kath, the main character was tryin to figure out how she could be in love with one guy and still be attracted to another.i like this book except for the fact that the author could have made it more dramaticand make the characters in the book show more emotion, and how kath wasn't married before having sex. i do recomend this book 2 teen girls who are in to movies like ""save the last dance"", ""she's all that"", ""cruel intensions"", and other movies like that.i dont think this book really has any lesson in it to be learned, i think it's just for entertainment. all in all this is a pretty good book."
1,1 Star is Generous,"I read this book maybe 15 years ago, and I remember it as being Judy Blume's worst. Every girl in my junior high was carrying around dog-eared copies of it and enjoying the ""racy"" parts; I can remember being in grade school and clustering in a circle with other little girls, titillating each other by reading the sexual scenes aloud. It was the equivalent of little boys sneaking a look at their dad's ""Playboy"" magazines. There are no redeeming qualities to the book; the writing isn't good, and there is no underlying message and no character development to speak of. I suspect Blume wrote this one just to make money. I would not recommend this book to anyone, least of all pre-sexual girls, as it won't teach them anything about literature, and it won't teach them anything very worthwhile about sex either."
3,A little too graphic,"I am 12, and I read this book in two days. I am very mature but I was not ready for it. I have read about it in a magasine,and bought it in a shop one day. While I was reading it, I knew that my Mother would not approve, so I hide it and read it in secret. I made the mistake of taking it on an airplane and reading it when I thought my mother was asleep. She wasn't. When she saw it she asked me where I got it and what it was about. I told her it was a little more adult and wouldn't let her see it. Then she got even more curiouse. Eventually, she found it and confiscated it. She said I wasn't old enough to read it. she was right. So, Please don't Read ""Forever"" unless you are 14 or over, and show it to your mother or father, if they arn't really strict and old fashioned."
2,Quick Read,"That's about the only positive thing I have to say about this book... It really was one of the worst books that I have ever read. Stereotypes of slutty characters being fat (I wrote a paper over this for my juvenile lit class) and supposedly ""in love"" characters and a false sense of resolution really ruined this book for me."
1,How could this go to print..?!,"Poorly written, zero story line, full of awkward sex, an absolute nothing of a book. So disappointed I actually tossed it after reading (and I never do that to a book)! Do not waste your time reading it."
4,excellent,I really enjoyed this book as a teen and still pick it up occasionally at 27 years of age. I believe that she captured a difficult time in a teenagers' life accurately and realistically portrayed the difficult choices and wrong decisions that they all make. I believe that this is a great book for teens to read as it lets them know about the results of their actions and also about being careful. Katherine realising that in the end she really wasn't in love with Michael was a great ending to the story and I believe that it would help teens to understand that what seems like love at the moment really isn't in the end and just how easily it can change. I also liked the subplot of Artie's suicide attempt. I feel that the characters reactions were accurate and heartfelt. A wonderful book about teen angst in general.
2,Used to think it was great...not anymore,Judy Blume IS a terrific author so don't all the sudden think she hasn't written any great novels because she has. It's just that 'Forever' is not the greatest book in the world. I'm actually quite surprised to see that many people gave it five stars. When I read this book a couple of years ago I thought it was the coolest book and now I know why. The sex caught my attention. Sure there IS some great sex in this book but I hardly see a plot. It no longer gets me hooked like it used to. But PLEASE do read some other books that Judy Blume has written. Many of them are excellent.
3,Changed my view of the world (25 years ago),"I don't remember the titles to many of the books I have read over my 32 years of reading, but Forever is one of those I will never forget. This was the book that never was in the library -the wait list was weeks long. Maybe because two decades ago teens relied on hushed tones and innuendo for sexual knowledge, Forever became an intregral part of all of my friends' expectations of relationships. Now, after reading thousands more novels as well as experiencing those very topics of the book in my life, I know the situations and plot to be cliche and unrealistic. But as a young ""just woman"" of twelve, Forever answered questions that were (and still are?) difficult to ask adults and helped my generation to become who we are."
4,my opinion,"this book is a good book and apropriate if u r starting highschool or older, it says 12 and up but it should be like 14 and up because like the scenes in it are worse then u could see in some movies and i am 15 and i just barely felt that it wasnt wrong to read it. it has a good bunch of explicit senarios that u minght not want a younger person to read."
4,A Good Example of Adolescent Naivete,"Judy Blume comes up with the most interesting ideas, though her usually poor writing ability fails to convey them to their uttmost potential. Luckily, this book so urgently describes teen ""first love"" that her writing style need not be considered. Although many have complained that the sex scenes are far too graphic, I disagree; they do not totally convey the physical realities of sexual encounters. Judy Blume effectively sanitized the sex act for her chosen parent/teen audience of readers. What the book does right is to demonstrate the shallow, extremely physical nature of a teenage relationship, and the characters' inexperienced - but changing - views on the subject of love."
3,I wanted to read more about Artie,"I really loved this book when I was a sophomore, and I still read it from time to time now that I'm a freshman in college. It's easy to read, you can get through it in two hours or less. It's an honest account of a teenage affair blah blah, I was just disappointed in the character development. I wish Judy Blume was able to develop Erica and Artie's relationship more, or at least give us more to read about Artie and his problems. It was slick, though, the way she used Katherine's hard-to-get attitude with Michael, and then used it again with Theo. Nothing was outstanding about the book, I liked it because I felt like I was reading about any random person that used to sit by me in high school."
4,Blume is one of the best. Before her time for YE.,"this women is just good. A writer, a storey telled and a human being. Great combo. Each of her works I read get better and better."
4,I love this book,I love this book this book is so good. i had to read it again. the second time was better then the first. i hope you would make a second book . that would be awesome .
3,An O.K. book,"This book, ""Forever"" by Judy Blume, was a very good book. I have always thought that Judy Blume was a very good author, and that strengthened my thoughts. The only thing that I didn't like aobut this book was how descriptive it was. I was only 11 1/2 when I read it, and all I remember is how descriptive it was when it came to sexual things. I think that there should have been a warning on the outside about its' descriptiveness."
3,No real emotions,"I read this book a couple of months ago, and I don't see how it could be anyone's favorite book. It is so bland, I can hardly remember the characters now. Katherine always seemed to have things going her way, and Michael was a giant horny TOAD. Don't read this book if you are looking for more than a few little sex scenes."
5,A great read for young women,"I read this book when I was 15 and passed it around to all my friends until someones mother confiscated it! It is a beautiful novel of first love and sex. I got it for my niece and she finished it in 10 hours!! This is not a particularly graphic novel so I wouldn't worry about letting your teenager read it, it's no worse than they hear from their friends and might get a reluctant reader to start reading."
4,Good read overall,"Overall this was a good book. It was a very easy read. The language was simple but the content was mature. Although at a glance it seems the entire book is about sex, the underlying story was a very good message and I think any teenage girl will be able to relate in some way."
5,Forever-Judy Blume,"Being a teenager myself, 17. I think reading this book reminded me a lot of the stories I hear today. Some people view sex as a priority... others, a gift. This books best aspect was its honest way of describing how teenagers deal with change, growing up, and relations with the opposite sex. I recommend this book to parents, teens (both boys and girls), and even adults without children. Beware, it is blunt. But in fact, very true. I have read this book neary 5 times, almost done it now! It's a very quick and interesting read. So go ahead... Read it!:)"
3,Not Very Good,"i thought that it was cheap and did not have a good story. It does illustrate first love well, but it seems like that's it...no other story. I recommend that you get this book from the library if you really want, but that's it...don't bother buying it!"
1,book quality,"in all the years i've been ordering books from amazon, i was so disappointed to get this book made with cheap 'newspaper' quality paper. i bought two, one for my daughter and one to gift and i'm embarrassed to gift ... not the cost, but the quality. it's so cheaply made, it must have cost a nickle to reproduce. i am seriously considering going to local vendors only and avoiding amazon all together."
2,graphic,this was a very inapproprit book.blume used very graphic terms and imigis in this book i read it when i was twelve and found it to informitivewait till you are 14
1,Forever,"I thought this book was unpleaseant. The boy and the girl in this book were really odd. I don't think anyone should read it. I read other Judy Blume books, but this one was NASTY!!"
3,Forever: Should it be read by young audiences,"This book was sex, drugs, and more sex and drugs. It is not appropriate for young audiences it should be banned or noted by a challenge. It tells how a teen age girl looses her virginity."
3,Nice book,"I found this book readable and fairly interesting but there where very few times where I found myself truly eager to turn the page. It was good.. could have been better... won't change your life if you read it, wont ruin it either. It was cute however with a nicely realistic ending."
2,Wasn't actually that good,"This book was recommended to me and therefore I was very surprised that it wasn't very good. I don't care about the explicit nature of it. In fact, sex scenes were the only ones that kept me remotely interested in the story. Book just wasn't written that well. Language is overly simplistic, there is no depth to the story. Even at 17 there is more to a teenager's emotions than: I like the guy, he is nice, I want to have sex with him, I love him, etc. Plus, the relationship described fell flat, too. There was nothing to it, no love, no infatution, just sex."
4,Forever?,"This book tells the truth of what is really happening in highschool. Even though it's been banned and challenged,you can't hide the truth from people. I suggest you read this book, when you are old enough, in late Jr. High or High school though or it may be to much for you."
5,i love this book,"i loved this book. i always felt like i had to hide it from my mom. i really learned so much from it. i was about 13 the first time i read it and i was like wow! i can't wait until this is happening to me. its a really sweet story, and i still wish kathy and michael had stayed together. but that would make it a completely different book. i would really recommend it to any teenage girl. its very sexual, and thats exactly what they want. believe me!"
5,This book works!,"These exercises work, but what you need to know is that sometimes they take time. If you have had a problem for a long time, you need to invest the 5 or 10 minutes you need each day for about 2 weeks. I don't know how they work, but who needs to argue with success!"
5,Soulful&Mo Soulful,the O'jays words can't even begin to describe the Soul these Brothers laid down back in the day&still do.Vocals that made you feel Warm&Hit your Mind all at once.together with Gamble&Huff&the Philly Family they created Classics upon Classic that still hold up to this day like they came out Last Tuesday.I Have these songs on Various Sets&they are treasured.this is a Box Set that does Justice very full&Captures the Greatness of this Group.
4,Swan song for the trio!,"Recorded with a mobile studio in Hawaii, which probably didn't help them keep their focus on recording. Still a very good album and their last album with the original line-up. The album was a modest hit in 1977, but pop music was being over-taken by disco and America was fading from the spotlight that they had enjoyed since 1972. Surprisingly none of the songs made a dent on the singles charts and none received much airplay. Best songs are God Of The Sun, Don't Cry Baby, and Monster. Bowing to commercial pressures the album does include a disco song, Slow Down."
1,Beware of this vendor - No integrity,"I ordered a battery for my camera and waited two weeks to receive it. When itarrived, the packaging looked very old/dusty and the product appeared to have beenforced into the packaging and taped. The battery was not the one I ordered anddid not fit my camera.I contacted the vendor and received no response. Amazon did refund the money ontheir behalf, but in the meantime I had to start the battery search/wait all overagain."
4,An interesting read with alot of twists and humour trown in,"This was the first book by Alan Dean Foster that I have ever read, and I must say I am impressed. I usually read books of Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler variety, but I was bored and it was there. As I started to read I was immediatly brought into a world where, at least for one man, the whole world changes in a second. So it's a desperate struggle for him to try and discover who he really is, and where he is really from. Along the way he encounters aliens, ghosts, other versions of himself (including a female one), and even a world occupied entirely by versions of himself!!! I enjoyed the small bits of humour thrown in and the actual science was kept to minimum. I highly suggest this book, no matter what you usually read, you will enjoy it!!!!!"
2,Foster -- not at his best.,"This book is definitely Foster. If you are paying attention - and who wants to do that reading Sci-Fi - you can pick out some insights to that theme Foster has been leading us to for twenty years. In this story you find some insights to that mysterious evil that seems to be lurking at the edge of all of his novels. Finally, we get a glimpse of those aliens who fled the evil. For those of us who love and follow Flinx, you will get a treat."
1,Skip this one,"I saw this book and was ecstatic! Parallel universes _and_ Alan Dean Foster, what a promising combination. There's one problem. It's pure fluff, completely disconnected. You're better off watching some old Sliders episodes. My big conclusion after reading this book is that I can't trust name recognition anymore."
1,This is probably the worst book I have ever read by Foster,"This book is slow, boring and definitely not up to Mister Foster's past accomplishments. The main reason I find this so frustating is that I have read every thing else he has written at least five or six times. This one only well... In fact, on three separate occasions I have tried to finish the book and couldn't..... Did I say it was boring??? Let me make that clear.... THIS BOOK IS ONE YOU WILL WANT TO PUT DOWN!!!!"
4,It's a dance party disc,"Beautiful, BIG remixes; they build with a lush unhurriedness to the heart of each song and then back down from there. True dance club strains. If you like to move and like to move to Mary J. this is a perfect CD. As a reviewer said below ""if you're not moving to this you must be dead."" Exactly."
3,NO MORE DRAMA,"I WAS DISPOINT I EXPECTED MORE, A FEW CUTS WERE FANTASTIC BUT SOME OF SONGS REMINDED ME OF SONGS BY PAST ARTIST."
1,bootleg.....,"No I don't own this series, but it is a good series and this ""boxset"" is obviously bootleg. So if you don't care about bootleg stuff then whatever, but for everyone else I strongly reccomend buying the real boxset, whenever its eventually released or just buy the regular dvds, if you refuse to wait or something then just download some fansubs or whatever, but do not pay for a bootleg product. Buy the genuine dvds instead, they deserve some credit and money for their efforts, .hack//roots, is awesome, and actually so are the other .hack animes as well. Anyways, just wanted to clear this up for anyone who might inadvertantly purchase this set thinking they are getting something legit for some reason."
1,Bootleg,"Why would something in English and Japanese have Chinese subtitles? The answer is that it's a bootleg. This is a crying shame. Why pay for something you can get for free? If you're paying for something, then you should get the real thing! Two thumbs down."
5,Perfect fit,Another good match by Amazon! Fit perfect in my truck and looks original. Would buy again and tell a friend without hesitation!
3,Didn't care for the drive,"Just a matter of preference, but I didn't find the overdrive section of this to be very useful. It allows gobs of brittle sounding distortion vs. the kind of overdrive that adds warmth and grit like the front of an amp being pushed. Even if I was reviewing it as a distortion pedal and not an overdrive, I still wouldn't have liked it. It probably has its uses, just not for me.I still give the unit a 3 because it is built solid and the boost section is fine. I would recommend the MC401 paired with a separate overdrive.Update 2/21/13: If you are looking for a pedal similar to this with pre/post boost and a GREAT O/D section, try the Gristle King. It costs twice as much and is hand-made, but you won't regret it! (T-Rex had licensed it and massed produced them, but discontinued it. The original developer is hand-making them once more)"
1,"This is a -3 on the scale: Just the facts, please ...","It is such a shame that Llewellyn does not take the care to verify facts before publishing something as full of fallcies as this.The right reverend takes cultural artifacts from Haitian Vodou and attributes them to South Louisiana Hoodoo. He claims there is a S. Louisiana head pot, the equivalent of a Haitian Vodou ""Pot tet."" He claims there is a necklace like the Haitian Collares. He even claims a fais dos dos is a Hoodoo ceremony. This books is full of complete fabrications.""Step inside a world of magic and intrigue you never knew existed-enter the hidden world of the Hoodoo.""You never knew this existed because it doesn't except in Rev. Ray's own mind. Please bear in mind if you chose to spend your hard earned money on this, that it is 97% fiction."
1,so very dissapointed,"I bought this book because I was intrigued by hoodoo and other african based faiths which incorporated catholocism. I brought it home and began to read. The more I read the more I was dissapointed. The book is nothing like the other hoodoo boks and online things I have encountered. I read all of the reviews for this book and would have to say that I too feel the author wrote this with one aim, to make money from naive people."
1,Dissapointing,"I dont believe I have ever read a more dissapointing book on Hoodoo and conjure. I have read many of the other reviews and I certainly agree that this book must have been written just to make some money from those who are unaware. Not only does this book present inaccurate information but the author has taken much poetic license with his ""view"" of hoodoo. I wonder if he just copied a bunch of things from other llewyllyn books and made this one."
1,Definitely NOT Hoodoo!,"Being a practitioner of authentic Hoodoo, I can tell you that this book is not about real Hoodoo. What it seems to be is a mixture of a little Hoodoo, Santeria and New Orleans-style Voodoo. There is workable magick here, but if it's Hoodoo you want, look elsewhere."
1,oh my god,"You know there are a whole lot of books on the market claiming to teach one thing or another. I have seen a recent influx of books supposedly about the root work practices of new orleans and the south appearing on shelves everywhere. I am sorry to say that this is the worst of them all. A better title for this book might have been ""Wiccas view of rootwork"" There is almost nothing factual presented here, pnly the fantasy of an author who seems to be out to make a quick buck. I would either venture to guess that the author is a scam artist or more likely, someone who has studied rootwork on his own and then presented this information as a way to make himself feel more important. If you are considering this book I would reccomend that you compare its contents with a more substantial work like Hyatts or Cat Yronwode's works. Upon comparing the books you will see major differences and will be better able to weed out what is fact from what is fiction."
1,I think 53 used copies for sale is proof enough,What can I say about this thing called a book. It disgraces everything and everything about hoodoo as practiced in america today. To think that the author had the gumption to present this collection of fabricated information. If you are serious at all about respecting those who practice hoodoo then don't insult them by purchasing this trash.
1,This is just rediculous,I read this book all the way through and have never been so disgusted with a book in my life. I agree with the person who wrote in saying they believed this book was written to simply fill a contract. Typical Llewyllyn garbage. This book doesent even deserve a one star rating. If you are looking for a book on Hoodoo I suggest the one by Cat Yarowande. Whatever you do please don't support this book by wasting and cash on it.
1,AGREED!,"I deffintly agree with each reviewer that wrote in saying this book is terible. I was skeptical when I saw the little half moon on the spine which hallmarks Llewyllyn publication. I picked the book up at Barnes and Noble and sat down to read. I spent a good hour and a half looking through the book, reading parts and laughing. This book is almost total nonsense. The author either has no idea what he is talking about or he has decided to dupe people into buying nonsense. Ya wanna learn about hoodoo then read mules and men."
1,Special Cream? Who are you kidding! Don't waste your money,I was so disappointed that I donated it to charity after a week. It stunk and didn't make a dent of any kind with my hand pain. It's a BenGay wanna be that doesn't smell nearly as good. The vendor refunded my money less the shipping so I can't complain too much except to say this product shouldn't even be on the market as it gives false hope. Buyer beware. I use Activon with great results now.
2,A Modern Mumu,Scratchy....tends to strangle (one's self and others)with its long strings...ends in the worst spot (top of mid-hip...make up your mind...are you tunic-length or a top?) My Cuddle Dud long underwear are sexier than this.
2,Not sure if I got a defective one...,"It seemed like a nice little lamp; clip worked well, etc. You have to fiddle with the screws to get it to pointed in the right direction, but that's not a big deal. Maybe I just got a defective one but mine stopped working after only two uses."
2,Not so sure I like this...,"It was easy to put this together and the chart on the back of the box was helpful. However, the design of the joint makes it difficult to twist the lamp into needed shape and the clamp is difficult to open up. Due to the force it takes I have some doubts as to the items longevity. It won't be as easy to hang this over my cacti as I hoped."
3,Clamp difficult to figure out,I can't use this product as intended without the assistance of a handyman. Photos for assembly with clamp were not helpful. I've currently moved my plant to a location where I can prop up the lamp.
2,Burnt Out Bulb,My plants reacted well to the light while it lasted... bulb burnt out after only 2 months of use. And of course it is past the return period so I have to buy a new bulb. Very unhappy...
3,"Fixture fine, bulb messed up","The fixture itself arrived just fine and in good working order, but the bulb was garbage. I pulled the bulb box out and I could already hear the busted filament swirling around. Not only was the filament already out, but I tried putting the bulb in anyway, just in case it *might* still work, and you can't even screw the bulb in properly. It has to be screwed in crooked in order to stay in the fixture. I tried another CFL I had laying around and it fit just fine and showed that the unit was functioning properly, so I guess all I have to do is get another bulb. I suppose $20 is an okay price for the unit itself; but be prepared to buy another bulb if you order."
5,Happy,Living in the North Country we have LONG winters...so my plants are very happy to have some extra light on the cold dark days here...
3,"cheap, and easy","This is a good grow light if you have smaller plants. I'm currently using it for my aquaponics garden above my fish tank. The area it covers is poor, but if you have the light focused on a specific plant, it seems to provide enough light for it to grow. I might purchase something bigger, but these are perfect for a single plant, or a few smaller plants closer together.edit-some slight burning going on with the leaves of my chili plant....Keep an eye on the distance. There is a really small threshold between this light being too close, and too far away from your crop."
4,Good fixed position added light for plants,"I bought a couple of these to clamp to a tiered plant stand for the winter, to give a bunch of low-light to med-light houseplants a bit more ""sun."" I turn these on for a few hours after it gets dark (around 4 pm right now!). The plants look much healthier and happier with this bit of added light and warmth.The clamp and hood mechanism work well if you plan to set the lamp at a fixed angle/position and leave it there. It's a finicky process however if you want to regularly rotate the direction of the hood, as it involves loosening the nut and making sure the bracket doesn't slide off the hood while trying to move it. And certainly a process you can only do when the lamp is off and cool.I'm happy with these for their current purpose. However I think for some other spots where plants need light I'll investigate some inexpensive gooseneck lamps and just buy the dayspot bulbs."
2,Burned out quickly,"It worked beautifully for about 3 months, but while I was away for the weekend it apparently burned out, 300 hrs into its supposed 3000 hr lifetime. With no sun for two days many of my carefully cultivated plants took a turn for the worse. Make sure you keep an extra bulb on hand if you buy this one!"
1,Strike two,"These bulbs suck. Amazon's service is top notch though. 24 hrs after after complaining about my 1st one that burned out after only 3 months there was a whole new kit @ my door! ...and, it still sucks. The new one lasted 20 SECONDS! I give up. These are crap. Total waste of money."
1,ONLY 60 WATT UNIT,Do not be misled. This is only a 60 watt unit. Seller will take back and send 150 watt unit only at customer's expense. According to seller: Miss leading ad is Amazon's fault and broken bulb is UPS fault. I'm giving my 60 watt unit to GoodWill and ordering a 150 Watt unit from another seller.
2,Overpriced,"For what you are buying, this is way overpriced. I have yet to see my plants grow, but I am still waiting."
3,"Product as described, but didn't quite work for us","First, I agree with the other reviewers that the lamp is easy to assemble and the clamps are very effective and reliable. As far as I can tell, the product lives up to its description. However, we were hoping that it would provide a sunlight substitute while germinating some seeds indoors this spring and these lamps (we purchased two) either did not provide enough light or it was not the right kind of light. The seedlings were near windows and they were all growing with spindly stems toward the windows, even though we had the lights on all day.Overall, we were disappointed in the results and wouldn't purchase these lights again, although the fault may not lie fully with the lights."
4,Good low-cost lamp,"This lamp is a good low-cost solution to keeping plants indoors. It is suitable for one or two normal-sized potted plants. I use mine in my work office. The clamp fits well over a 2-inch wide window post and is very strong, but I wouldn't try to put it on anything any larger. I like the simple look and the black hood doesn't stand out.The bulb burned out after a few weeks, but replacements aren't too hard to find."
3,Quality leaves something to be desired,"I purchased this light in order to keep a lemon tree that I have alive through the winter in my room which gets very little natural sunlight. Not long after purchasing this, the light blew up. The glass part of the bulb shot out at my tree! Haha. I returned it back to amazon for another one, no problem. However, after a short time, but beyond the return period, this light burnt out too. So, I ended up purchasing the following bulb and all has been well.Bulbrite 50R20PG 50W Plant Grow Reflector BulbPerhaps I just got unlucky with some bad bulbs. The fixture, for what it is, feels pretty sturdy and while I had the original bulb, it definitely managed to keep my tree growing nicely through the winter.Definitely worth a look."
3,Good light.,Works well in my den! Would recommend for those touchy plants that need more sunlight during the shorter days in winter.
4,"Great set up, get replacement bulb ASAP!",I really like this grow light. The spring clamp is very strong and will fit onto anything no more than 2 inches wide. The light bulb that came with it only lasted two months but was able to germinate several green chile seeds. I recommend buying a replacement bulb with the product as several other reviewers have also commented on the short life of the light bulb.
1,Don't waste your time and money,"The lamp arrived with packaging intact. However, the lamp is dinged in several places. It also doesn't light up. The same bulbs that don't work in the lamp work in other fixtures. We returned to Amazon and got prompt refund."
1,Not very good !,"You know I bought these car mats as a birthday present for a girlfriend. Initially she fell in love with them. However, after the first week she complained to me that there was no `prickley' things on the back of the car mat to hold it still on the car floor. GREAT, I said...As months went on she complained to me again that she almost was in an accident because the floor mat had moved so much it got caught up under her clutch while driving. She quickly removed the floor mat from her car. GREAT again.I get in the car last night and almost fall getting out because the car mat had moved so much and tangled my feet upGREAT again...Don't buy this product please? It's unsafe and no quality at all."
4,My Toshiba Satellite,"I am totally satisfied with the size, screen, keyboard layout, and ease of portability provided by my new Toshiba. The crisp picture and lightening speed only add to the enjoyment I get using the laptop. The one problem I have had is with Vista and its incompatibility with some of the software I had on my last laptop -- Documents to Go, Norton 2006 security and firewall, Letter Linker, and the internet connection to Blue Zone at my work place. Vista also gave me problems when I went to set up a VPN to connect to my work place, but finally was able to get a connection set up. Aside from those issues, I have nothing but good things to say about the the Toshiba and would happily recommend it to anyone who's looking for a small but powerful laptop that's easy to use and easy to carry around."
4,small and powerful machine,"pos- robust spec: core2 Duo T7200, 2G memory, 160G HDD, DVD-RW, 801.11 1/b/g wireless and 12.1"" LCD- best price compared to the specs.- bright LCD, light weight, nice and firm body design- built-in FireWire and 5-in-1 memory card reader- lots of connectivity (3 usbs)- vista ?con- lots of heat from side vent.- kind of noisy (fan)- no bluetooth- I got a dead pixel in the middle of LCD- vista !!!"
4,Very pleased,"This notebook is very portable and very usable.The screen is great. The keyboard is easy to use.The Vista operating system works well, but it is a bit slow because of its huge size. I'm glad I got 2 gigs of ram."
2,Started hot - died early,"I was very pleasd upon receiving this unit. It had a hot processor, but the DVD drive died completely just two days after it arrived. I asked Amazon for a replacement unit, but they instead refunded my money. Too bad. I really liked the speed and features on this model. Since I couldn't have a replacement I purchased a similar Toshiba with only 1 gig of RAM and the slower 1.66 processor at a local store. Again, too bad. It is VERY slow in comparison.After using the origninal unit for just two days, I really liked it despite a flimsy DVD drive. My guess is Toshiba will have a lot of problems with it over time. If the DVD drive hadn't died I would have given this unit 5 stars."
5,Super fast!,"Light, super fast, comfortable keyboard, ultra bright screen, and over 2-hour long battery life! No wonder this model is often out of stock. The only downside is Vista, but that's work in progress and has nothing to do with the PC's capabilities. Hopefully Vista's 1st service pack will be available soon as various software makers are catching up with the compatibility issues. If you are thinking about upgrading, this is the model to focus on. It's packed with the same or better features than more expensive similar notebooks(e.g. Dell, Sony, etc)."
4,Computer is Great - Vista is the PITS!!!,This small laptop is just what I wanted. The speed is fine for my needs of downloading photos when I travel. Good keyboard and a good display. The only thing that is BAD is the operating system!! Windows Vista which is an abomination!!!
1,Toshiba is junk,"I've bought two Satellite laptops, and both have had their batteries fail within two years. One of them won't keep a charge for more than a few minutes, and sometimes powers off when you disconnect the AC power; the other sometimes just shuts down at the slightest movement. When we called the tech support, they didn't mention that the batteries were subject to recall; now I just found out, and Toshiba won't process the recall. I don't know if the problems are battery related, since it'll cost $500 to have Toshiba diagnose the problem. That's right, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS once it's out of warranty.The screen on the newer laptop - just two years old - has gone funky, with some horizontal lines.They both run somewhat warm, with the fan going nonstop.As you can tell, these are my last Toshiba laptop purchases. It's great value for the first year, so enjoy!"
4,Toshiba Satellite Laptop,"This laptop fit the bill. I had a Libretto before but needed to update. This laptop filled the bill. Small, lightweight and fast. I liked it so well I bought one for my girlfriend, who is now my wife, so she must have liked her's as well."
3,Toshiba U205-S5067,"I don't like the keyboard layout as well as some other models. Also, the screen isn't as bright as my 3 year old HP was. Also, the glide pad isn't as positive feeling as some I've had. This is my 5th laptop in 10 years. It's all right, but I wish I'd have held out for a Sony or maybe even a Mac. I don't like Vista, but that's not the computer's fault."
5,OPTIMA LAPTOP,"ESTA COMPUTADORA ES MUY BUENA, ES ULTRA PORTATIL Y LA RECOMIENDO PARA LAS PERSONAS QUE TIENEN QUE MOBILIZARSE POR SU PESO , ES MUY LIGERA ME ENCANTA MI LAPTOP SE LA RECOMIENDO."
2,Two women and the meat industry,"Another example of the West saving the savage and uncivilized East. It seems as if those poor non-white women can only be saved by someone with a western education. While I enjoyed the writing, I did not enjoy the tone of arrogance."
2,The Enduring (In)Significance of Amy Tan,"A simple structuralist review of My Year of Meats, or The Enduring (In)Significance of Amy Tanwhite man: sacred; good; complex; sophisticated; cool and rational; jazz like fingers and allAsian man: profane; bad; simple; mad really; inscrutable; oriental yes men in need of Western pacification; false simulations of Western icons"
2,a poorly written novel,"Have you ever had a really attractive girl wholeheartedly recommend a book to you? And have you ever been annoyed that this book turned out to be shallow propaganda, where there are no characters and only caricatures, where the beef-eaters are stupid and evil, and where the lesbians are perfect? Maybe the attractive girl was from the UK, and maybe the book was ""My Year of Meat"" (as published there.)As other reviewers have mentioned, there are redeeming moments in this novel, but they will fade away toward the end as the reader starts drowning in schmaltz, cliche, and beef blood. Skip this book. Choose one that doesn't try to teach you a lesson."
2,Propaganda with stereotype characters,"Let me start off by saying that I agree with every word in this book about American beef. However her presentation is very clumsy, sterotyped and PC. The pro-beef characters are all evil while the anti-beef are all good. The white men are mostly evil, while the third world women (especially lesbians) are all perfect.It's too bad because she obviously knows how to write."
5,"An entertaining and intelligent look at women, men, and meat","What a wonderful first book! I took it with me on a business trip and ended up staying uo all night reading it. Jane Tagaki-Little is a heroine for the 90's. She's full of life and courage and has a mean wit -- skewering the meat industry, men's perceptions of women, Japan's vision of America and America's vision of Japan--in equal parts. But more than anything else, it's a great read. I couldn't stop chuckling and when I finally finished it, I wanted to start all over and read it again."
3,"Part novel, part political treatise","This started out as a good read about what it takes to make a documentary but turned into a piece on the evils of meat-eating and the meat industry. If you have a weak stomach, this isn't the book for you. If you are an animal-rights activist, you'll love it."
4,richard00@hotmail.com,"This is a very fine book. I enjoyed the dual perspectives of the Japanese wife and the Amerasian director. It clearly presents some real problems with the way food is processed in this country. I think some of the information is presented in a very biased way (the beef industry obviously did not have a chance to respond). However, I rethought my own approach to nutrition after reflecting on this book, particularly beef consumption.I enjoyed the numerous characters with which Ms. Ozeki peopled her story. They came from all walks of life and had varied and interesting backgrounds and lives. The story also played out as a bit of a detective story as our protagonists find out more and more information about beef and their own lives. I look forward to more books from Ms. Ozeki."
1,My advice: Read something else,"I'm glad so many people have found pleasure reading this book. As for me, I read about 25 pages and found no reason to read another page."
4,Do i really want to eat meat anymore? :),"Well I thought this book was really good. I kept wanting to read it, it was hard to put down. There were a few boring parts, but even though it was fiction, makes me think if i want to eat meat. I like how she worked in a little romance into the book too. Overall i suggest reading the book, i was emotionally involved and I just thought overall it was very good. :)"
4,"Great Statement about Gender, Race, and Globalization","""My Year of Meats"" is an entertaining novel, written in the style of a video documentary, adeptly translating video techniques to written form. The style and writing are new, different, and interesting and are not at all unclear. Jane, the main narrator, has a great sense of humor. She had me laughing out loud throughout the book. Beyond bringing me the enjoyment of reading the work of such a talented, funny, artistic author, ""My Year of Meats"" provided me with a new and different perspective on the discourse on race, gender and globalization in America. I highly recommend this book."
4,"great story, good writing","What a feat. The reader learns a lot about the meat industry, but is thoroughly entertained. Kind of gooey/sentimental in parts, but I can't wait to read another by Ms. Ozeki. If this is her first novel, it's AMAZING that she pulled this off."
4,Captivating,"Ms Ozeki has such a wonderful writing style - such a varied vocabulary. I loved her unique interchange between East vs West, with the ultimate merging of the 2 cultures. As for description, well all I can say is that even now I can visualize the slaughter of a cow to make food. This is one of my favorite books of all times and one I will keep in my bookshelf."
4,Shocked and surprised by book!,"I picked up this book randomly, never having heard of it before. I have the UK paperback, which may be different from the American. On the back it talks about the two women, and the parallels between them. Did I know it was going to slide into an indictment of the American meat industry? No. Did I know what sort of things were going to develop for our protagonists? Of course not. It was a white-knuckle ride. The author draws you in and gets you interested in the characters, and when you're ready for it she begins showing you the darkness. I was shaken by the time I got to the end of the book, but it had a consistent ending that I could be happy with. Thumbs up!"
4,A bit breathless but a page-turner.,"Like the anti-Japan WWII propaganda films made in Hollywood, that had a platoon of beseiged Americans bonding despite the presence of an Italian-American from Brooklyn, a Jew from New York, a ""Negro"" from Tennessee, etc., ""My Year Of Meats"" touches battered women, lesbians, blacks, and adopted Asian kids before turning on the enemies, the American meat industry, commercial television, and advertising agencies. It's a neat plot, and it has a happy ending (which the author, in an interview in the back of the book, later discusses). She demonizes the meat industry with that most dangerous of weapons: a little bit of knowledge. But hey, the author's a kid. She'll grow up and write even meatier books, I hope. Hai!"
3,I'm both a vegetarian and a DES baby and now I know why!,"Twenty odd years ago I came across a small article talking about DES and meats, it was at this time I learned about my precancerous condition and my DES history. It's no coincidence that I embraced vegetarianism, however over the years I took on the meatless life style and forgot the reasons behind it. With the Year of the Meats, the reasons (more than I had 20 years ago) came back with a vengence and gave me a whole lot more reasons to continue my lifestyle. The book's documentary style comes across as a bit preachy at times, the characters are a little too strong or too weak or too nasty, but the book is interesting and offers some insights into the beef stock industry and American and Japanese cultures, neither of which come off wholely imperfect. It is a bit slow at times, but recommendable."
5,Excellent book,"This was so nothing like I expected - it was not a preachy or sensational account of factory farming/slaughterhouses but an interesting novel with real characters that give you information about abuses in factory farming while giving you a great story as well.It's about two women:Jane is a documentary maker who gets hired by a Japanese TV station to make a weekly documentary called ""My American Wife"" - it's sponsored by Beef-Ex so it's supposed to be about American women preparing some kind of beef. Jane ends up trying to make social statements and finds out some disturbing things about how beef is raised and produced.Akiko is the TV station exec's wife in Japan - what her life is like with him is obsessed with her becoming pregnant, how he mistreates her and what she does to keep some control over herself and her life."
5,What can I say?,"All I have to say is that I just could not walk away from this book. I loved how well it was structured. It has great flow and was very easy to follow. I caught myself numerous times gasping, wincing, laughing out loud as I read. What I find most captivating is Ozeki's uniqueness in the book: who would ever think about 1)""beef and the industry on tour"" and 2) JA/Japan culture clash and be able to get away with it? Again, Ozeki's worked definitely exercised my facial muscles and damn, I'd do it again!"
2,Way too heavyhanded,"This novel is part of a disturbing trend in recent fiction, in which the characters are nothing but cardboard cutouts groaning under the weight of the political (in some cases, theoretical) issues they represent. I'm sorry, but Jane Takagi-Little is nothing more than a collage of positions on an ethnic and political spectrum. She just never comes alive. I agree with the criticisms of the meat industry here (and yes, wife beating is bad... not too challenging a conclusion there), but without the convincing characters (or comic relief of any kind) to engage skeptical readers, books like this are just taking easy potshots for the pleasure of the converted. A shame... this book could have been really good."
3,"A good book, give it a try","I picked up this book by accident, I was bored and it was at my parents' house. It started as an easy read, I skipped all the Japanese poetry (I don't ""get"" poetry) and read just the content of the story. I did enjoy the book, and even learned a thing or two.The book reads like a bunch of short stories which are collected together, with the main character moving through them."
5,it's all about the image,"This book is excellent because it's an unforgiving romp through modern day America and the hurdles it holds for artists, people of multicultural heredity, and women. It's also an unforgiving look at some of the Japanese misconceptions of America and how they're perpetuated.What I really love about this book is the role-reversal of strength and the confrontation with one's own self-image.The other real clincher is that the book hits on a real life issue - medicines in our meat - in a way that hits the reader right in the gut. It's a well-researched heads up for our social consciousness."
3,"Four legs good, two legs bad","Actually, the first half of this book was good, the second half not so good. The first half has some splendid satire; it is funny, biting, and engaging. Ozeki manages to poke a lot of holes in American and Japanese materialistic culture and consumeristic values while throwing in a few thinly-sliced jabs at the meat and marketing industries. The story had ""meat,"" but it was still amusing. Then Ozeki dropped her story on the slaughterhouse floor, so to speak, and from that point on it was a dreary, painful, strident, depressing, bloody mess. There's some redemption and happy-endings at the end, but I think I would have liked it better if she had stuck with the original tone and style. I was getting the message even before Ozeki started using the sledgehammers. The first half is good fiction with a message; the second half is an emotional mockumentary at the expense of story. Still, I will give her second book a try, All Over Creation."
4,You may finally become a vegetarian.,"Although meat is far from the only topic in this well-written and compelling novel, it becomes a multi-layered metaphor for American excess, a woman's identification with her body, and humans vs. nature. It is funny, poignant, grisly, thought-provoking. I would have liked to have a little more understanding of the characters in the secondary story (which primarily occurs in Japan). It was difficult to know if they were supposed to represent their culture or were primarily a counter-point to the main story. Nevertheless, I found all the characters believable. Enjoy with a tasty veggie-burger!"
4,Being Vegetarian Never Felt Better,"Ruth Ozeki will make you very thankful that you have sworn off meat if you have adopted a vegetarian lifestyle. Personally, I have done this, and if I felt I was not missing meat at all before I read this delightful book, now I know that I definitely am not missing it! Apart from these items, the book deserves a lot of praise for the interesting way it brings together the stories of two women, one Japanese, one Japanese-American."
5,soul grabbing,"I chose this for the author's name and the title-- I am married to a Japanese and I liked the name Jane Takagi-Little, thinking it was a foreign wife of a Japanese. I was wrong-- but it didn't matter. The book caught my full attention from the first page. I felt such sorrow for Akiko, the wife of the Japanese ""typical"" salaryman, and as I was reading the book on a crowded train being elbowed, pushed, grabbed and shoved by real life ""polite"" salarymen, I hated John even more. All the characters evoked emotional responses from me. They were real, authentic, and unique. I laughed out loud in some parts of the book, cried in others. I wait for the next novel by Ruth Ozeki."
5,I only read for pleasure ...,"Really enjoyable fiction. Had I known the subject matter of the book, I likely wouldn't have read. I only read for pleasure and dislike being in any way preached at or lectured. Ozeki's book does a great job of being excellent fiction, whilst still carrying an important message. I am already anti-beef, due to environmental issues, rain forest destruction, and animal cruelty issues. I wish all of my beef-eating Atkins friends would read this book."
3,Shockingly Interesting,"This story displays what really happens when American products are introduced into different cultures like Japan. Learn the differences between a Japanese-American woman and a Japanese woman and what struggles they must face when a Japanese/American company tries to force meat into Japanese culture. In addition, learn some shocking truths about the meat you're eating, a little hormone called DES, as you delve into this beautifully written story."
5,I can't stop telling people about this book,"I loved this book. I have gotten my sister's book club to read it, and a couple of my friends. It is so delightful. For some reason the two storylines really work well together and you feel deeply connected to each main character. The author made me laugh many times out loud, and I love that in a book. I can't wait to read something else by her."
4,Savory Surprise,"I found this copy of My Year of Meats on a bargain table for 2 bucks. How could I resist. I had just finished my own year of meats having lost weight on a no carbohydrate diet. So the title caught my eye. It sounded like a cute, quick read so I picked it up. What a surprise. This cute, quick read had me laughing out loud, and reading through my tears. The connection between the two ""heroines"" on either side of the ocean was remarkable, and the faxes across the ocean were a wonderful bridge. This is an important book. I feel enriched by having read it, and to me that is all I can ask of any book."
1,Ecclesiastes,"I love Ecclesiastes. But if you plan on spending more than a $1 on this small book you're wasting your money. In addition, all three of these pocket canons I ordered were damaged and I could tell they weren't damaged from shipping. They were just ""that way""."
1,Cacophonous,"The title cover tries to do a good job explaining what it is we're supposed to be envisioning while listening to this mess. I especially like the condescending apologetics for track 11, The Final Invocation (Towers of Light): ""...[It] is almost programmatic, and for anyone who was in close proximity to the World Trade Towers when they fell, or simply moved by 9/11, it is deeply affecting."" Also, ""...It really evokes for me the sense of souls ascending to the heavens."" God, I hope not to be greeted by that racket shortly after dying!Track 9, ""Brooklyn Lullaby,"" by far bears the closest resemblence to a piece of jazz music. However, Mr. Jackson simply cannot let a single track get away without being rudely interrupted by at least five seconds of his dissonant blurting on the piano.Perhaps I need to pop a few Xanax or Effexor in order to reach the hyper-emotional state that D. D. Jackson must have achieved while composing this ""music."""
1,"Garbage, don't waste your time with this.","When I purchased this item, I was looking for a couple of features: filterless air purifier and a UV component.The air filtration was less than impressive. Having used the Ionic Breeze before, this ineffectiveness of this air purifier was immediately obvious. Nonetheless, I continued to use it until one day, after three months of usage, I noticed it wasn't working at all.I contacted customer support at Surround Air, with the understanding that I would send in the unit. No, instead, they sent ME the pieces to replace... because I was responsible for shoddy manufacturing? The disassembly of the purifier was extremely difficult as tiny screws were initially machine torqued in. After much frustration, I ended up replacing the pieces and it worked again...for another couple of weeks and then the same problem occurred.Stay away from this one-- it's not worth the problems."
4,Fantastic Read,"This book contains a foreword written by a CLASS ACT, Mike Krzyzewski. Much unlike the classless Gary Williams, who refused to attend my barbeque ----- Perhaps this explains why can't pull recruits from his own backyard? This is described in detail in chapter 5. Mr Vitale is a pleasure to read. He describes his trips to Cameron Indoor and his friendly conversations with Coach K, Mike Dunleavy, and Wayne Gooch."
3,Mother Tongue,"Mother Tongue is a broad compilation of poems selected by Peter Hargitai. The book of poems emphasizes greatly in his own relationship with his mother. The title of the novel goes along with the book because it establishes the idea that Peter Hargitai is Hungarian decent. Also he shows his desires and emotions in the novel ""Mother Tongue: A Broken Hungarian Love Song"". ""Bed Bugs"" is one of my favorite poems. The reason i like ""Bed Bugs"" is because this bug can be many things, or a feeling of doubt. As you see at the end of the poem he admits to having difficulty describing his feelings. So therefore i believe the poem leads to the tittle of a broken Hungarian with many difficulties."
3,Mother Tongue- A Broken Hungarian Love Song,"This book of poems tells a story of a boy and his experiences as he grows up. Some poems were touching, others were sad, some had hints of jokes, but mainly of the struggles he went through as he grew up. The poems were very well written, but sometimes a little difficult to understand since they are from personal experiences, therefore some had to be explained by the author to be understood. If he just added notes about his life throughout the book it would have been better understood. But overall, the book deserves three stars."
4,Wow,"All I can really say is: WOW! The poems in this book were amazing. Who would have thought that the author Peter Hargitai has gone through so much in his life. This book of poems really gives the reader an insight into the author's life. The poems tell about the bad relationship with his mother, his mother sending him to live with his aunt, his mom's obsession with her brother, and so much more. If anyone feels that they have it bad in life, this is the book to read to show you that what your going through is nothing compared to Peter Hargitai."
4,well writen,"""Mother Tongue"", a son's struggle with himself and his family is a great autobiography/poem book. This piece of writing starts off with a resentful son who is full of pain and sorrow due to his mother's lack of attention, and concludes with a somewhat forgiving son. Poems in this book are composed by real life experiences, which make the compositions much more touching. By analyzing these verses the reader can convey that life is not always as hard as one might think. You come to the conclusion that through poetry people can truly express themselves and in return impact your life. Awesome display of emotions read and you'll see."
4,Mother Tongue (A Broken Hungarian Love Song),"Reading mother tounge has left me with new insights on life. It describes the relationship between mother and son, from the son's point of view. His struggles were due to his mother's critical, cold, and bitter personality. This depiction of the author's real life events gives readers a look into his deepest, darkest feelings and the struggles he grew up with. This book of poems takes the reader through a cavalcade of thoughts, worries, fears, and anger. It shows how the author overcame these enormous obstacles and in the end, came to forgive those that trespassed him and even more importantly, himself. I rate this book with four stars."
5,Therapeutic writing,"""Mother Tounge:A Broken Hungarian Love Song"" is a collection of poems written by Peter Hargitai towards his mother. When reading this you can easily feel the pain a young mr. Hargitai must have gone through as a child. He was constantly fighting to gain acceptance and maybe even a little bit of love from his mother.This comes through in his work.it is very obvious when reading these poems that they were written more for the author than anybody else.What im saying is that you can tell that he only wrote these poems as his own way of dealing with his mother.This is a great example of how one can really heal themselves just by writing."
4,Mother,"Peter Hargitai is an incredibly direct man. By just this comment you can imagine the bluntness in his poetry. I use to believe that poetry was all phony feelings but I stand corrected by Mr. Hargitai. His distinctive style of writing is just as captivating as his usage of words. Peter Hargitai has such a unique characteristic of making words come to life that if he were to describe a wall I would be intrigued. I recommend ""Mother Tongue"" to anyone who may have the wrong interpretation of what poetry is all about."
5,Review,"Mother Tongue is an excellent collection of poems written by Peter Hargitai. He describes his relationship with his mother, how he despises her, and how finally at the end of the book he is able to forgive her for all the oppression she bestowed upon him. He also shows us the hardships he had to go through when he transformed himself from a small town boy in Hungry to an American.Peter Hargitai does not hesitate to demonstrate his feelings toward his family, especially his mother, life, and growing up. I found myself connecting with Hargitai while reading many of his poems. Even though he went through his share of hardships in life with his family, he was finally able to surpass them and marry the woman whom he genuinely fell in love with."
4,Emily's review of Mother Tongue,Mother Tongue: A Broken Hungarian Love Song by Peter Hargitai is a greatly composed collection of poems. The transition from poems about himself to poem referring to his mother and wife give the reader a clear cut peep hole into the past and emotions of this author. This book captivates not only your soul but takes you on a wild weird road down a unique individuals journey through life. These poems are full of pure emotion in all its forms and I think they are superb.
4,beautiful poetry,"This is a wonderful collection of poems. Some deep and painful. Others interesting. Some a little confusing. Others, light hearted and funny. There's a poem for everyone and they're all beautifully written."
4,From the Heart,"This book is very powerful and tounching. If you want to read and experience something that will touch you in a way that a lot of books don't, you must read Mother Tongue. This book is the story of Peter Hargitai's life and he invites you to take a closer look and see what he has been through. These poems are from his own personal collections.The way Peter Hargitai writes his poems in the book is unique. You will know how Peter's life was from a young child to a grown man. You will experience his hard times and his pain. The book invites you to feel what he's feeling which captivated me as a reader. I really don't read a lot of poetry but i recommend this book."
4,Mother Tongue: A Broken Hungarian Love Song,"Mother Tongue is a uniquely and peculiar book of poems, not your typical book of rhyming poems that is easy to understand. No this book you have to put a sufficient amount of thinking to understand it. You might even catch yourself reading some poems over and over again to fully understand them and to get the correct meaning behind the words of the poems. Peter Hargitai is an emotional, intense writer who is able to put all his feelings on paper with many details. Some might say in able to write with such vicious emotions and to be able to be so depictive you must have a magnificent gift. It seems as if the author challenges every reader to try to decipher his intellectual work; it's a real obstacle."
3,Growth through words,"Mother Tongue is a psychological journey. Peter Hargitai takes you through the chaos of his love and hate for his mother. The poems in this book are so varied in emotions that anyone can relate and they truly touch your heart. The book reads like an open wound healing slowly with words. The ending is where the author finds peace within himself and his mother. The poem that finishes the book brings sunshine, hope, and new beginnings to the reader and author."
4,Real Poetry,"Mother Tongue is a very unconventional book, compared to the few poetry books that I have read. It has obscenities, crude expressions, reality and many other qualities that make it good and enjoyable to read.The second part, Mother Tongue, is the best one. Poems like ""Broken Hungarian Love Song"", ""I'm Bored to Death Just Being"" and ""Mother's a Racist"" make the book a total hit; and lines like: ""Man like to bore through panty and eat"" and ""You mean it, as if I were not your son."" keep the reader stick to the poems until the end of the whole book.I really liked most of the book and I will recommend it for anybody who wants to try something different from the conventional ""pink"" poetry."
4,Mother Tongue,"Mother Tongue: A Broken Hungarian Love Song is a collection of poems, written by Peter Hargitai, that are based upon his relationship and feelings toward his mother. The poems all vary in their tone and emotion. Some have a hint of sadness, others are angry. It is clear that there are feelings of neglect, and you can see how this spans all the way from his childhood to adulthood, from suffering to forgiveness. We all have parents, so I think this collection of poems can really touch the reader's heart, and one can truly identify with the strong emotion Hargitai feels toward his mother. He really opens up a door for all to step into his mind and relate to what he's feeling. We all have mixed feelings about people, the balance between love, anger, joy and sorrow. I strongly recommend Mother Tongue to any reader, especially fans of poetry, which I am not, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this selection of poems."
5,Mother Tongue,"Mother tongue by Peter Hargitai is definitely a piece of art that will touch the reader's heart in one way or another. The collection of poems is a direct effect of the author's soul. The poems vividly express the pain, frustration, fear, and love in the author's life at different times of his life. Through this book I could see the darker side of life, because dark is something that I have not yet experienced in my life. Though I cannot relate to the author's life, the author's honesty and freedom in expression of the poems help me to better understand his life. I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and an open heart."
1,Artic Tale DVD HD,"Just got the DVD today 8.23.2010. I have been waiting to see it. First tried to play the DVD on my computer, disk read error, then tried to play the DVD on Blue Ray DVD player disk read error again, then tried to play DVD on regular DVD player but disk still read error. Do not get to see Artic Tale,very upset about. I was expecting a very good quality picture because it's a DVD HD, turn out to be no picture at all.."
1,Liberal Propaganda Tripe,"This movie is NOTHING like March of the Penguins. Don't be fooled. It is a load of liberal propaganda that was laughable. It's billed as a ""real-life adventure"" when it is OBVIOUSLY set up. If you know anything about the two species the flaws are obvious. I find it absolutely AMAZING that the photographers found two separate species at birth that come together in a specific life or death struggle against each other...years later. The constant ""the ice is disappearing"" only shows the uneducated attitude of the script writer. The world isn't stagnate. IT CHANGES and IT'S NORMAL. If you love Al Gore, you'll love this movie. 'Nuff said."
2,"If you want nature Docs in HD,, stick with Planet Earth & Galapagos!!","Just saw it,, and it was the worst recent documentary I've seen!!I know polar bears are cute but stick with Galapagos...he'll Planet Earth has better polar bear scenes in a show not sowly focussed on them!I enjoy Queen Letifah but not here..here voice is heartfelt and warm but the other narrations in Galapagos and Planet Earth were soooo much better! I'm sorry,, but any movie that adds fart noises is not a ""documentary""!If your expecting Planet Earth or Galapagos PQ then look elsewhere...THis film was fuzzy for the most part,, and probably looked the same as the SD disc. Very Dissapointed,, especially since this is a nature flick.The AQ is also not great,, but most Docs arent due to lack of music as it focuses on the voice of the narrator. But you really cant judge this category without an explosion.Movie: 2/5PQ: 2.5/5AQ: 2/5Overall: 2/5"
1,It's a very poor global warming destroying the artic documentary.,"This was yet another global warming crisis all the artic wildlife is dying oh my gosh call Al Gore, style documentary. I have young children, ages 2 and 4 years old, not a film for them.Low points:1. Fake snow dubbed into the picture. Why they felt this was necessary, I will never know. It's an insult to the viewers intelligence.2. Not originally filmed in HD. And not transferred into HD well either. This movie will not give you a HD experience, might as well buy it on regular DVD. There is a lot of noise & grain throughout the movie which detracts from what detail there is.3. It's a documentary, but I question the validity of the material presented. First it's too warm to survive, then it's too cold to survive. Very contradictory information. Probably it's just that the director tried to over-dramatize almost every event in the movie.A very disappointing movie."
1,More Global warming than heart warming,"The film and narration were good, but the story was over-the-top with global warming rhetoric. Some things presented as fact are highly debatable and I felt that the producers were purposely exaggerating because we viewers are so dumb we need hyperbole to learn."
4,Wasn't that bad,"I don't understand why this single flopped so badly. I just got my first listen of this track on ""Essential Toni Braxton"" and I thought it was a decent song. The vocals by Toni and her 4 sisters, Tamar, Trina, Traci, and Towanda were very good and on point. I think if this didn't flop, Toni's 4 sister could have had a better music career. Tamar, Trina and Townada released ""So Many Ways"" in 1996 and then Tamar went solo and then only released one album. Towanda Braxton sought help on the recently canceled reality show ""Starting Over"" and we're still waiting on an album from her. It would be great to see Toni and her 4 sister make a recording together again. I think it could help Toni's career since it is not doing so well right now."
5,Just Beautiful !,"I was turned on to A.R. Rahman by the music I heard contained in the movie ""Water"", a beautiful Indian film. Rahman is a top composer in India and the world for movie sountracks. An album you can play over and over and not grow tired from. Well worth owning. ~ Russell"
3,Eeek!,"This is a very odd CD. It takes a famous piece by Smetana, Vltava (The Moldau), a flowing, sweet depiction of a river, and combines it with about three fourths of Dvorak's wonderful expression of grief, hope and faith, the Stabat Mater. All fine music, but not best joined in this way. If you like the Dvorak enough to want three fourths of it, you'll be better off getting the whole thing, all of which fits on one CD in the performance excerpted here, and which can be had very cheaply usedhere(with his famous New World Symphony),here,hereandhere. The performance is a worthy one, long a favorite of mine.The Smetana piece can be had on countless CDs, and very likely in better recordings. (It's Vltava, not Vitava, by the way, if you want to search for it.)"
1,Sadistically brutal killings + Extremely illogical + The main character's too young to be convincing,"This movie contains sadistically and explicitly brutal killings. There are also many extremely illogical holes. For example in one scene, a detective could have shot the assasin from afar but he did not do it. He just ran closer to the killer. He's so close that the killer just snatched the gun from his hand and killed him. Yeah right! Another problem is the main character's too young to be convincing.It's not worth watching."
4,Interesting film,"This is not an action film don't let the trailers fool you. If you buy, rent, or download this film thinking you are going to get wall to wall fist fights and shoot outs you will be disappointed. This is more of a film in the vein of To Live and Die in LA. A cop pursues a criminal who has killed his partner by any means necessary. A criminal tries to evade the police and get back home. It is a simple plot but it is the performances of the actors, the lighting, and the direction of the film that makes it compelling. The action is served up in short intense bursts of almost animalistic savagery. The commentary with Bey Logan and Edison Chen is also terrific."
5,You have to hear this one!,If you like stories that take place back in the days of the wild frontier then you will love this audio book. Jeff Curran does a superb job of narrarating this story. He brings all the characters to life and you'll find yourself actually caring about what happens to them. If you buy this book make sure you have six consecutive hours to listen to it because you won't want to turn it off until it is over.
5,All your breast cancer questions are answered here!,"What a wonderful resource for any women- whether you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, a caregiver or you are just looking for the latest information on breast health. These questions are compiled and organized in a way that is easy to read and understand. I am thrilled to know that this resource is now available! I would definitely recommend it."
3,Dont Know,"I bought this product and expected more quality of the images like when you see it on the PC, but is not like that"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,same complaint as most other people here....works when plugged in but not on battery power....I wish these reviews would have been here before christmas.
2,50% Great 50% Yuck,"I purchased two for Christmas gifts, one for my mom, one for my mother-in-law. My mother-in-law loved hers. I preloaded it with family photos. The software was easy to use. The pictures looked surprisingly sharp for their size. She was thrilled when she opened it. My mom never received hers. I preloaded it as well but the screen was dim and all the charging in the world would not make it work correctly. There was no trouble-shooting info that could help correct the problem. I was very disappointed! If you are lucky enough to purchase one that works correctly - no worries! But, if the odds are truly 50/50, I'd look elsewhere."
4,WOW! Better than expected,"When I ordered this keychain as a gift for my wife and parents my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the picture! Better than what I get on a cell phone. The images are crisp and clear, and the quality of the keychain is fantastic!The software is a little awkward, but very easy to learn.High recommend. The price is worth it!"
4,Chain Problem,"Great product. I bought this item for my husband to show off pictures of our kids to friends and collegues. Very, very easy to use and upload the pictures. The quality of the pictures on the device is very crisp and comparable to what you see on your own computer. My only gripe with it is that the chain broke, the very first day he took his keys/keychain to work. I know he can be a little clumsy but a keychain with that kind of device hanging from it, should withstand more than the everyday tug of war we inflict on it."
1,Doesn't Work,This is a problem product. I wish I read the reviews before I purchased it. The thing doesn't turn on except when plugged in. Widespread issue with these. The design is nice and looks good quality but no worky. Picture quality is poor as well. If you buy one it may or may not work. If it does work when you buy it don't count on it working for any extended period of time. Now I have to go to the store and find another gift for my wife. Find another product!! Don't pull out the credit card for this item!!!
1,Junk,"This is an absolute piece of junk. I rather use a better word to describe it but junk will do.If i could go lower than 1 star, i would do that too. At first my wife loved it. She loved the idea of carrying around pictures of our daughter and dogs. But it seemed that eveytime she wanted to show off her new present, it was dead. The dam thing wouldn't hold a charge. Within 2 and half months the thing is dead. Wont turn on, wont do nothing. I think maybe 10 people saw it working the whole time we had it. The next time it comes up, we will be sure to let those 10 people know not to buy this one. Find another one cause this one is JUNK."
1,Unacceptable,"Device only displays when connected to USB or AC power. Picture quality is horrible, appears to have high density red/purple filter - makes color photos appear as washed out negatives. B & W look a little better but not acceptable. I bought one for my wife and foolishly bought another for my Mom before first one arrived. Based decision on 4+ stars on Amazon site. If negative stars were an option, I'd give it a -5 stars."
1,TAO - review,This product did not even come close to my expectations. It's actually not good at all. I tried contacting the company for help; got no answer. I tried to contact the company to be able to return; got no response. I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this product & service - or lack thereof.
1,Defective,This was a gift for my mother that on Christmas Day refused to work. Total rubbish. I have read several other reviews that say the same.
1,It just doesn't work,"I had the same proplem as several of the other reviewers. The unit would not wold a charge. it would only function when plugged into a power source; and when it did function, the colors were washed out.TAO must have the worst Quality Assurance department on the planet."
1,Worst junk I ever bought,I bought two of these as gifts for christmas and both never would turn on.Do your self a favor listen to reviews like this and stay away from this product.
2,Had to send it back!,"This item was easy to use and the software was simple. But after I downloaded my photos a red line appeared right through the middle of each picture and even on the ""downloading screen"". I emailed TAO but of course received no response. The picture quality was poor and once you save the photos to the software you can't edit them. You have to erase them, upload them to the software, edit them, and then redownload them... daunting! I ultimately had to return the item."
3,Great Picture,The picture is very clear. The chain attached to the digital frame broke after two day in different areas. Easy to install and download picture.
1,Chain broke,2 days of my husband using this idem on his key chain it broke. Very expensive disappointment. Easy to use. Need now to find a replacement piece.
1,Burst my bubble.,"I didn't have high expectations for this item.... I just wanted something simple that would display a few pics of my neice for my mom to show off to her friends. It was going to be a gift, but after receiving it, I realized that it was a piece of junk. Sure, the software is easy to use, but after resizing the pics to the manufacturer's specifications, I realized that nothing would help this thing work the way it should. After uploading about a dozen different pictures, there was not one that would allow the viewer to comprehend what the picture was of. The display was fuzzy, and just a general disappointment. Save your fifty bucks and go develop your photos on snapfish dot com into a hardcover photo album, and enjoy! That's what I did, and I only regret that I wasted so much time on this crappy product."
1,No good,don't waste your money. battery died after sitting in wife's purse for 3 days (not even on). so made the thing worthless since she just wanted it to show pictures on. invest in a memory card for your cell phone and carry your pics that way...much better.
2,Too bad! But I found an alternative that works.,"I found the device worked perfectly...as long as it was plugged in to the wall or the computer. Kind of defeats the purpose of being portable. The software worked great and the device looks great, very solid. After the fact I wished I bought 4 of the same item, found one that worked, and returned the others since from the other reviews it seems there's a 50/50 shot they actually work. I wrote to TAO technical support and they said to press the power button from a certain angle for up to 10 seconds. It didn't work. I ended up going to Brookstone and buying their device. It's not quite as cool looking, and is more lightweight, but it works. Actually the brightness of the images is better, plus there are 4 colors of covers that you can buy to protect the item in your purse. It really works and looks good."
2,Digital keychain not ready for prime-time,"TAO 1.5-Inch Digital Keychain Frame (Brushed Metal)I was crazy about my TAO digital keychain from the moment the first images of my 1-year-old granddaughter popped up on it. Friends probably ordered some too, based on my early recommendation. But then, some problems developed: the chain broke on the first one; on the second, either I couldn't turn it on or it wouldn't hold a charge. I'm on my third keychain now, and the on/off button works erratically. While I can usually make it work---and I love it when it does---I think maybe this clever device was rushed to market before all the kinks were worked out."
1,Very disappointed,"I was really excited about this product and thought I had finally bought the perfect gift for my husband. This was supposed to be his father's day gift, however, when he loaded the pictures onto the keychain, the pictures were so dark that you couldn't even see them. I'm not sure if this is typical or if I got a defective keychain, but either way, we were both really disappointed. I would not recommend or buy this product again."
2,maybe it's just me...,"The picture quality on this item was so awful I returned it. Maybe I was expecting too much. The interface was super easy to use but, boy, its kinda useless if you can't even see the pictures."
4,Great gift,"I bought this as a gift for my dad on Father's day. It works very well and was greatly appreciated. My only problem, however, was after loading the software onto my computer, the screen was too large and I couldn't add any pictures. I ended up using a newer computer and the software worked fine. Older computer owners beware."
5,Love This Keychain,"I had been wanting a photo keychain for quite some time, but after doing the ""homework"", I discovered that they weren't very high in photo quality...and then I found this one. I love the quality of the photos and the program for uploading the pictures is very easy to use. It holds 30 pictures and although that doesn't sound like a lot, it really is a nice capacity. I love the fact that I can manually view the pics with the push of a button, or choose to let it display a slideshow. I am very happy with this keychain. I feel the price was very reasonable, especially when compared to others of lesser quality for the same cost or more."
1,Failed product and non-existent tech support,"This product did not work out of the box and after one and a half months of ""tech support"" they determined that the product in question was defective. That was several months ago and the return/exchange process has been halted as I cannot get contact with my representative (or any other representative for the replacement of the defective item!!! Extremely frustrating as I have spent hours with their tech support and done their mail in forms and all I have to show for it is a broken item which I still have no ability to exchange for a working one!I'd strongly advise finding another company's product to do this for you."
2,Disappointed,Bought for my wife to show off pics of new grand daughter. Loading pics easy-great display of pics. The problem I had was very short viewing times between battery charging. On two occasions after a full charge for 30 min. and maybe total viewing time of 3-4 minutes over 5 days the unit had to be recharged. Returned unit to amazon with full refund without a problem.
4,Surprisingly clear,"I bought this for my mom as a Mother's Day gift and loaded pictures onto it. I was extremely surprised at the quality of the pictures/screen. I'm glad I ordered this newer model. The older Tao held more pictures, but from reading the reviews on it, I am guessing the quality of the pictures on this newer model is much better. The software is extremely simple to use and makes it very easy to crop photos for close up shots. I expected the keychain to be a bit bulky, but it's not too bad at all. I am very happy with this purchase, as I'm sure my mom will be, also."
4,Very neat little gadget,Even though the screen is quite small the pictures are quite clear. This device is not made to view large group photos but works well with individual or average family size groups. Battery life is not as good as I would like it to be but it charges quickly. Very neat little gadget for the person that seems to have everything. Well worth the purchase price.
2,Don't give as a gift!,"The first one received stopped working after 5 minutes of use. I contacted Tao customer support to see if I was missing something but never received an answer. Returned it through Amazon and quickly received a replacement. The second one works pretty well (at least for the past week). Software has to be downloaded from the company website (OSX) which Google warns contains malware, so be aware. If this is a gift for yourself and its on sale, it may be worth the risk. But, its not worth it if its a gift!"
2,Disappointed,I ordered two of these as Christmas gifts. The first one worked ok out of the box. The second one had a gray display when it was plugged in to the USB and would not power on at all when it wasn't on power from the USB cable.The Amazon return process was very easy.
4,The Tao Keychain,"This seems like a good product. The quality of the screen image is good. The software that is supplied to transfer digital images to the unit is easy to use and works well . . . I was disappointed with the size of the screen. I guess I misread the product details. When it is described as being a 1.5-inch digital keyframe that reference is to the overall dimensions of the body of the unit, so do expect a smaller viewing area than 1.5-inch. Still the image size is such that it shows a good picture. I'm happy with mine and I hope the ones I bought as gifts will be enjoyed by their recepients . . . I haven't had much time to see how this product looks after being in service as a keychain carried in a pocket for a while. Its possible the screen may get scratched up some from rubbing against other pocket contents. So that is one thing to consider."
2,Didn't work for me,"worked for less than a second. would only power on when connected to ac or pc. RMA'd already. I'll get the brookstone version. 2 stars for good build quality, solid case."
4,Great gift,"Easy to load and edit. Cool, fun product great for a gift. Only problem is the spring pin that connects the chain to the digital frame (like the one that holds a watch band) has come out."
2,Be careful,"When I received this item. I thought it would be great. Easy to install pictures. However, 2 concerns. First, I was constantly concerned about the face being scratched since keys are often thrown around in purses and pockets. The keychain is also big and heavier then expected. Not recommended for dads."
4,Picture slide,TAO 1.5-Inch Digital Keychain Frame (Brushed Metal)This item is handy and accepts all the pictures. The clarity of the picture was ok but not as clear as a camera would be. A bigger picture would work better.
3,Good service from Tao,"I bought for my mom, and it came with a battery problem. It turns off when unplugged from the USB. I called TAO's support and they are shipping a new one to Brazil to the address I designated with no cost.Whenever it gets here, I'll edit this reivew.In spite of the problem, the keychain is nice (a little bit heavier though) and the image is OK considering the size of the screen.Let's wait for the new one.For now, I would give 1 star for the product since it came broken, but the service seems to be pretty good so far. For that, 3 stars now. Will change that whenever I have the new one."
1,Terrible Product!,"That was a big disappointment. It works well at first, but if you turn it on more than 2 times, the battery is dead! I ended up buying the Brookstone one afterwards and it not only works great, the battery lasts a long time, but also it is A LOT lighter."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this as a gift and had to return it. It worked as long as it was plugged in but wouldn't even turn on otherwise, which defeats the purpose of it being a portable digital frame. Hopefully it was just a single faulty item, but I'm going to go with a different brand as a replacement."
1,Do not recommend,Purchased this for a Christmas gift back in September. Family member opened it and loved the idea. Never could get it to work. Will not charge or will not come on. I've written three letters to the company with NO response.
1,A real piece of...,"I should have taken heed to the reviews. This was to be a gift for my husband but it got here after Christmas so I figured that I would load pictures on it and give it to him for his birthday. Well, I'm so glad that it got here late because IT DOES NOT WORK! Pictures are dark, the back button doesn't work and it won't come on without the power source. Thanks to Amazon for easy returns because I have a feeling that I would never see my money again if I bought directly from TAO. And oh another thing, I have a sneaky suspicion that the positive reviews that this junk receives come directly from the TAO marketing team. Look into it Amazon!"
4,Siguiendo con la misa,"Sí es verdad, no son los verdaderos Electric Prunes, pero este disco tiene el sello personal de David Axelrod y el ingeniero-productor Dave Hassinger. Es una obra conceptual muy bella, no llega a la psicodélica Mass on F Minor, pero definitivamente es un muy buen álbum, imprescindible para coleccionistas de los Prunes y de la música de Axelrod. Canciones recomendadas: ""Kol Nidre"", ""Holy Are You"" y ""The Adoration""."
1,this is not right,"this is not real electric prunes. dont know who this person is or the members . if you are a true electric prunes fan than dont get this , its a hoax as far as i can tell."
4,"Good musical content but not the Jake of ""Hooked""","I ordered this CD by mistake thinking it was a follow-up to the excellent 1986 release ""Hooked"" by the original Jake. This is a solid sonic rock sound from a young Christian trio and I will keep it in spite of the mistake. The compositions are quite good for the style and I am perfectly in sync with the ""love"" theme, although not based in a particular religious ideology. My only criticism is the group handle; you ought to find a name that does not leverage the work of others."
2,better items are available,"I tried to save a few dollars in purchasing a number of Stanley products....what a foolish mistake.....I should have gone with the better products (Klein, for example)....this is nothing beyond mediocre."
2,Not how I remember it,I love this classic story but I'm not crazy about this version. I wanted a children's version and this one was just a little on the boring side. The art is well done but again not for children.
3,Good place to start with ESL,"This book is very helpful for starting to learn sign language, but truth of the matter is, all deaf people sign somewhat differently. No matter how much you try to learn, unless you actually communicate with a deaf person who will correct your signing, it's useless. It is a good place to start learning English Sign (uses alot of initialization). I do recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn, but I even more recommend immersing yourself in the deaf culture."
4,One of the better contextual books I've seen in a long time.,"Although no book can offer a 100% benefit relative to actual signing, this book is not cluttered, nor is it difficult to understand. Colloquialisms play an important facet to American Sign Language, so this book too will appeaer to be biased depending on one's own locale. Signs are used in context compared to others who categorize signs such as ""animals, family relationships, etc."" The author concedes the fact that not all words necessarily have a universal sign. I have used this book for instruction and it has been very successful."
2,bad graphics with a focus on Signed English,"I admire the other reviewers who were able to learn from this book and who found it useful for their purposes. As for myself, I found the graphic design very confusing: the point of view shifts with every word, from hands alone, to face, to head and above, to chest, as well as from the side to the front.Furthermore, the book is most useful to learn Signed English (or as this book calls it, Pidgin Sign English). I am more interested in learning American Sign Language, because I have an interest in the grammatical structure of other languages and because it's a more dominant form of communication between deaf persons.The information content is dense and presented in complete sentences, so if you can get past the graphic presentation and if learning ASL isn't important to you, this could be a good book for your purposes."
5,Simple Made Easy,"I own many Sign Language books (textbooks, dictionaries, etc.) and I found this book a wonderful resource to help beginners to sign sentences right away instead of looking up each word in an sign language dictionary."
5,James Bond NOW scores a hit!,"Vic Flick is an amazing stylist on his Bonded guitar--he is going on forty-plus years of working the Bonds since he first strummed the world's most famous hero's theme for James Bond, Agent 007, in 1962's Dr. No.Flick has taken seven Bonds and well-covered them here, plus added three tunes of his own composition, making James Bond NOW one of the best Bond cover/re-mix albums ever done. The new arrangements and clever beats makes Flick's James Bond NOW a must do for any Bond fan.Flick's re-working of Diamonds Are Forever is brilliant and (dare I say it!) makes me wish Barry had let him have more of a hand on the overall soundtrack of Bond VII to begin with. His guitar work on all the tracks, especially For Your Eyes Only and Live and Let Die, evokes a great depth of feeling. This CD will stand up to many repeated listenings. Enjoy! Long live James Bond!"
5,007 Bond Flick,"A++++++++musical director John Barry composed,orchestrated arranged conducted james bond medley 1962 monty norman at the time had copyright.still to this day ...does not show remorse or without integrity to john barry contribution as music director norman original theme was rocky and no tempo or beat.. ..john barry medly music highly agree outstanding performance of vick flick gifted artist..It was a co-operation ground of both that did not make the grade on monty norman because he had worked on theme but the sound came out rocky..john barry should deserve credit for working it to perfection..uncredited.."
2,Does gold really need a preservative?,"The preservative in this stuff is real strong and makes it taste like cough syrup- or , if not cough syrup, something as equally unpleasant and familiar from back in the days i used to take pharmaceuticals (childhood).i wonder what could happen to gold without it- would it spoil? hm.i like their colloidal silver, that's got no preservatives."
4,Best Book Yet,Kerry Shirts's designs are one of the best things to happen in our scroll saw world. Kerry Shirt with Pat Spielman has put together more than 30 patterns of scroll saw segmentation in a new art form. Very easy to follow patterns with detail explanation on staining and finishing. All patterns are shown finished in full color. I buy a lot of books on scroll saw subject but I've never seen a book as well illustrated and detailed as Kerry's Scroll Saw Art.
3,Too greasy,"This product has a lot of oil in it so I don't recommend it for acne blemishes. Also, it doesn't cover up the blemishes at all, since it is almost transparent. There is one thing is it good for: If you have a sore that is not an acne blemish, like a mosquito bite, it is very good for quickly healing up such little blemishes. I occasionally used it on my arms and legs for that, but it's not worth it to me to order it online again. If I saw it around town, I would probably pick it up. It does heal up a little skin blemish pretty fast, but I don't think anyone who gets zits on their face would want to add the amount of greasy oil in this stick to their skin."
4,Order Of Nine A great metal band,"This cd is a throwback to the days when metal ruled! Great vocals, very tasteful guitar leads and solid drums. Put this all together and you have one of the best new metal ablums. The three Mikes put together a very good ablum! Mikes vocals remind me of Geoff Tate only with more balls. This is a great Prog-Metal Disc check it out!"
1,Magic Ameriacn Tub Caulkstrip,"I used spade to remove old caulking from the seam, vacuumed the area and wiped it clean with rubbing alcohol. After installing the Magic American Tub Caulkstrip, I waited 12 hours, per the instruction, before using the tub. The caulkstrip would came off within a few weeks."
5,I used for the new bath tub.,It's plastic and cheap price. I have a new tub so I hope it can last as long as the tub.
4,FALSE DAWN,"CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF JAKE LASSITER. GREAT BOOKS ALWAYS A GOOD READ. I LOVE THE WIT, ACTION EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CHARACTER. I AM A REAL FAN SO PAUL LEVINE KEEP WRITING. LIKE YOU OTHER BOOKS ALSO."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I have read several of Mr. Levine's books and found them all tobe consistently enjoyable to read. No, they are not literary masterpieces, nor do they pretend to be. They are well written, have interesting characters, lots of quips , action and interesting stories. These books were written for entertainment and,in my opinion, succeeded!"
2,There's much better out there,"This isn't a very good book. I had received it as a gift a few years ago and left it on the bookshelf for a while. I grabbed it on my way to the beach one day....should've left it gathering dust.There are many better choices for legal thrillers (if that's what this is supposed to be) and if you are looking for a mystery set in Florida with a comic/satirical edge, pick up a Carl Hiaasen novel (Stormy Weather or Skinny Dip are my favorites)."
4,I like the Lassiter series,"This one in the series was appealing because of the surprise factor: I really didn't know what was coming next. I like that, to be surprised and satisfied with the results. So, more Lassiter to read for me!"
3,Lassiter,"I enjoy the Lassiter novels.Thety are generally witty, fast paced and starrin Jake Lassiter; a rare breed. Good, quick reads for fun."
4,Lassiter,"This series is a fun read, Lassiter is a well developed fun character. The setting is always south Florida, and the charecter and plot are always entertaining."
1,Not worth buying new....,Bought it for my Palm TX from Best Buy.com - The package says 202 games for your pda but I only found 47 that I can halfway use. Some of those 47 freeze up the pda (new card) and cause it to reboot (palm os 5). A couple of the games are ok. But the rest is freeware that only lasts a few days. Bummer. Dealing with BestBuy.com was VERY cool but there was no mention of it being a bunch of shareware games. Oh well-live and learn.
1,Don't Release Head Colds,"I simply cannot listen to the track of Forest Murmurs by Wagner which I downloaded through Amazon because there are so many people coughing loudly during the soft beginning. This track should never have been released! It's played well enough, but to release this recording is irresponsible; the incessant coughing totally ruins the listening experience. I haven't heard the rest of the album and am not likely to because of this totally insensitive action."
2,955 beltronics,"suction cups dont work very well it doesnt stay hooked to windshield the unit it self is heavy. i do like the telephone style power plug, it has saved me a few times. not my first choice if i was to do it again."
3,Good but not great.,"Overall not a bad detector. It has good range but falses alot just like Cobras. It doesn't have a true auto mute feature - it quiets down but never shuts up completely like Cobras and Whistlers. You have to manually press the mute button to get it to stop chirping. And the chirping is ear killing!! It has the most annoying alarm noises out of all the detectors I've ever owned. On the other hand, it is very loud and I can hear it over my car stereo even when the music's turned up pretty loud! The display is very bright for day driving and adjustable when it gets darker out. Other than better range, I like my Cobra 9745 better and my Whistler Pro 78 the best! But hey, for a hundred and a half, I guess it's worth it. Nah, go with the new Pro 78 SE by Whistler! For the money, the Pro 78se will give performance close to the Escorts for way less money!"
1,"Poor design, lots of false alerts.","I purchased this to replace my 10 year-old Bel 846i, and was really disappointed.It is difficult to tell in the picture, but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver. On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea.For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible. Based on other reviews, I don't think this is isolated to a defective unit."
1,NO working,i got a speed ticket 2 weeks after purchasing this device.this device was running while i driving. but did not detect any signal from police.so no working at all. disapointed.
1,Too many False alarms!,I just got this radar detector and have used it for a week. It has K-band false alarms all the time. In fact durring one 3o mile drive I have over 40 K-band Alerts!
2,Unreliable,"I had it for a month and it was working OK although there was a large number of false alarms (in fact EVERY department store would produce a K-band alarm). Then after a month it just died - first it gave a message ""Servce required"" and then within another minute it just went dead... I haven't contacted their custumer service yet so I am not sure how helpfull they are going to be."
2,Product does not work,"First off i just want to make it clear that this is a review about the product and not the seller, so the low rating reflects the product review; Seller was great, very fast shipping, amazing price, and true quality packaging!So i bought this product because i had heard such great reviews and people swore that this was the best scanner around under $300, what they dont include in there reviews is that scanners under $300 do not work! After using this product for the first week and passing by police cars almost twice a day and nothing going off, i came to the conclusion thag i haf a defect. So i sent it back and they replaced it with a brand new one but still after continueously passing up cop cars and even messing with settings, i came to the convlusion that the beltronivs v995 is not a ""police scanner"" but rather a store alarm scanner.. Will never purchase any of beltronics items again. As for EB Electronics, two words- Great service!"
2,Repairs costly on this item,After less than two years of service my Beltronics V955 stopped working. I contacted Beltronics and was charged $59.95 to repair the unit. It came back to me saying the power switch was replaced. I did get the same unit back that I had sent in.Though I am content with the radar detector's performance I feel that I was forced to pay too much for repairs too soon after purchasing the item. It is not a cheap instrument. I paid aprox $150+ for it and could not afford to replace it when it broke.I think Beltronics should be more reasonable with repairs that are not the fault of the owner. It was not a question of any type of misuse created the power switch breakdown. For this reason I will not purcahse another Beltronics device.
1,Move along. Nothing to see here,"I wish could give a better performance review. It developed a issue with the plug at the cord on the detector side before I could get enough miles on it to give a legit evaluation. Amazon is not an ""Authorized"" seller. No warrantee . I would have to jump through more hoops and pay more than its worth to have it fixed.So in the garbage it went. Waste of 140.00+ dollarsDon't wasted your time and money. Cut loose and get a escort or V1 or just slow down"
1,Ticket,"The product appears to warn me about many sources of radar in my area - hospitals, etc. I had this product a week and was on the freeway traveling with the speed of the traffic and I received a $300.00 speeding ticket with no warning from the detector. I have gone back to my old way - personally scanning the horizon for police radar. I seem to be more reliable."
4,Not a Problem,"Came in the mail in a timely manner and the suction cups for the window mount arereally good. The radar itself works just fine and the only draw back maybe the volume could be a little bit louder for me but because of my love for loud music and concerts I have hearing loss! Good product for the money so go ahead and get it, Im glad I did!!"
1,"Three problems in first year, possible quality issues","The detector is great, accurate and easy to use, when it works. I own this unit since 2008. In the first year it was repaired three times, for three different issues, under warranty. I asked Beltronics to provide a replacement unit, since this one seems quite problematic, but they refused. In 2010 the unit started with a fourth problem, intermittently turning itself off and on. This could be one bad unit, but others on amazon seem to have quality issues as well, and Beltronics did not replace it after three in-warranty repairs."
4,Good Radar Detector,"I bought this radar detector after my escort got stolen. It is almost as goodas the escort passport. It's got good range, and false alarms are comparable to the escort. One thing I missed on the escort was the quick mute feature it had. So that is why I'm giving it a 4 star. The V955 has a mute button but it seems I could never find it quick enough. Other then that, it is a good detector. I'm buying one for my wife's car for Christmas."
5,Good buy,Have had this detector for about 6 weeks and am pleased with its performance so far. Seems to have good range and sensitivity. Now I just need to find a good mounting place for it to get rid of the coiled power cord hanging down.
5,Beltronics v955 Radar Detector,I also own a Beltronics V940 which I gave to my son which is an awesome unit. Was going to just purchase another v940 but went ahead a bought the new v955 as the price was less the $20 more. Wow what a great unit at a great price... actually slightly better than the v940. I would recommend either of these units as they are both great. The price at Amazon cannot be beat and I saved $$ from purchasing at a retail store. Thanks for price look-ups from your cell phone in the stores...
4,Nice but.......,"I read reviews about the silver color on top of the unit reflecting sunlight. It does reflect, it would be nice if the silver color was changed by manufacturer. It's not that bad though.I get a few false alarms but the alarm sounds aren't that annoying. Not a bad product for the price. I would buy again even considering the short comings I mentioned."
4,Wonderful Detector,"This detector looks and sounds very nice. The factory settings are exactly what I would have selected if I would have had to program it myself. I have not noticed any false resturns on the interstate. The only false return I have gotten in the city has been when I am litterally driving into a grocery store parking lot. The downside to this detector for me is that I wanted to permantly mount this detector in my truck. So I had to buy an direct wire kit for additional $15 from an seperate vendor. The book states that the higher you mount the detector the better the distance for detection, so I wanted to mount it to my sunvisor and I had to spend an additional $12 for an visor mount from yet another vendor. The detector does come with a lighter outlet cord and an windshield suction cup mount but that all seemed trashy looking to me. Overall a great product but in my opinion needs to come with more accessories."
5,expected performance from a veteran,"simply you can never get a better performing radar detector for the same price tag...I had it now for not so long & already saved me couple times..you just need to learn what every peep & every name of a band means & widely used by what kind of transmitter either its an automatic door, a cheap radar detector around leaking frequency or an actual cop...if you r too lazy to know about all of this stuff then pay more money for more filtering technology -that actually work- either by Escort or Beltronics both have the high end model with GPS -starts at $300- to make your detector even more quieter...just a small advice, don't waste your money buying a cheap ass detector like the hundreds of them out there for $45 or even $100 those r either a scam or just piece of metal that will peep with every mall/store automatic door opener around or traffic monitoring radar & when it actually peeps for KA band which is an actual cop he/she would be a few feet away!"
1,outdated product,"I got two tickets with this last yr 2011 , when i first got it in 2006 it was great now its outdated recently got the passport 9500 its great."
1,Piece of JUNK,I just passed a police car and saw the officer's yellow teeth before this piece of JUNK alerted the Ka band!!! People who love this must drive 66 mph in a 65mph zone!!! No wonder they never have a speeding ticket.Save your money and get something else. I threw mine out of the window.
1,Do Not Buy,"I read the reviews here before purchasing. It seemed like a risk but I thought I would give it a try since im going on a cross country road trip soon. Well im back from my trip, the detector worked for 1 day. Went to turn it on the second day, it presented some kind of error code and never worked again. What a piece of crap. Do not buy."
4,Great for the price!,"I have been using this radar detector for about a month now and it has worked great. The Autoscan function does relatively well filtering out garbage radar. I have used Cobra detectors for over 5 years as I enjoyed their displays and readouts, but they lacked in performance. My only gripe with this detector is that even at the lowest volume, the detector is still a little loud prior to it automuting or manually muting it."
4,Great Value... Solid Product,"Smokey doesn't know what's hit him. My new V955 is guiding me thru the streets of South Texas, so far so good. My little friend is a solid, easy to use partner in crime and I'm glad I didn't shell out the extra $100-300 for the newest models available."
3,Beltronics V955 Radar Detector,You know there's times when you should save money and go cheap but not on something that will get you out of a ticket. The Beltronics brand is well known and this radar detector is made well. I wish I would have spent more money on a better model. The range on this radar detector is not that great. It's good on a long straight road but even that sometimes doesn't help. Buy a newer better model!
1,and it's broken,"Well if you were wandering how long this product might last. Look no further - This premium Radar barely lasted 2 yrs. They will fix it for $79.99 - I'd recommend spending half the money and getting a Cobra ... it's cheaper and will last longer.My 2 cents. They don't stand by their product. Told me that was an ""industry standard"" ... to me the standard should be producing a quality premium product that lasts ... have read many similar reviews. I wouldnt buy this product. and I will not buy another Beltronics Radar ..."
4,High-end Detector at Mid-range Price,"BEL Vector 955 High Performance Radar DetectorPleased with the value and quality of my new detector. However, I wish I had a little more mute control. In fact, I returned the original order because the mute didn't work at all and the replacement still comes in loud and clear at the lowest setting."
1,don't waste your money,"This is by far the worst detector I have ever had.Does not detect even close signals. Had it in for repair twice, still does not work properly.Gives great false signals and makes a fine [although expensive]door stop."
3,Great Radar Detector... BUT,"This is a very good radar detector but if you try to use it while visiting Hawaii, it does not work. I passed speed traps where there were multiple motorcycle cops with speed guns aimed directly at cars, some at very close range (under 50 feet!). Drivers were being pulled over. My V955 remained silent. It seems to work well with conventional radar in other states I have traveled through, but whatever it is they use in Hawaii makes the V955 useless. This happened multiple times in different locations so this is no fluke. The war with electronic countermeasures goes on, and in Hawaii the driver is behind the curve."
4,high ratings justified,"Took the detector on long road trip and it did its job,usually got good warnings in time to adjust to the information. Only had it for a month...so far so good"
3,Great for the price,"Gives off ALOT of K band alerts. Build quality is very good. I have it hard wire. Saved my butt once. Was going 95 on the freeway, Ka started going off, so I slowed down and the car behind me changed lanes and cut me off and 45 seconds later a CHP out of nowhere flashed him. Well worth the insurance"
4,Beltronics 955,"Just received the unit about a week ago. Do mostly highway driving in Nevada.. Picked up State troopers b4 I even saw them, even on the turns .. Great range..360 all around..I'm sure others at double the cost are more efficient, but this is a good bang for the buck..I'd recommend it contrary to others reviews I've read.."
2,Its Ok......,Worked great for a few weeks but out of no were it stoped picking up K and X bands and it only detects LAZIER now.
1,TERRIBLE,its never gone off and i had it for a few months already. its never worked and such a waste of money.
4,In my opinion; best radar under 200 bucks,"I bought this last year after a speeding ticket - I wanted to be ready for the long drives. I did my research and it had great reviews, so I will sum up a few points on why I like it.Radar featuresIt has a highway and city mode which is great to switch through. It does a pretty good job on the k bands.Laser is lacking. It detects laser once you get scanned. Another issue is that sometimes the radar detection is a bit late.However it works really well and I think it is the best under 200. If you want better features, you will have to pay more."
3,And so it goes,"Decided to return this unit, the first time I have ever returned any purchase to Amazon, and I've bought a good number of items. The latch button on the main unit was impossible to operate. It was a fight every time to mount it and soooooo frustrating. Have decided to send in my old 995 unit for repair. But what little I did use it, it seemed to do it's main function of detecting radar pretty well. Your experience my be just fine."
4,Beltronics does NOT have European Ku Detection,"Not able to give a fair rating as I did not open and use. The features of this detector and the V995, indicates that they have full Ku detection which is used in Europe. Per Beltronics they do NOT install Ku band detection anymore."
1,Did not send product,"Hydrofarm failed to ship the product. When I contacted them 2 months later, they sent me a lesser product (60 watt), promising to send the 150 watt version when available. They never did this."
1,total crappy service,people who are planning on buying this light im telling you know dont i ordered the 150 watt light kit from amazon itself and i received the 60 watt light kit but i was charged for the 150 watt light these guys shipping the items are idiots plus the clamp is soooo stupid its impossible to put together i had to use tape to hold it together anyone whose planning on buying this just buy your grow light at like a hardware store or something
1,Cheap AND Cheap Quality,"I wanted to see if my orchid (second time orchidist, first was a black thumb of death) would do better in my poorly lit apartment through the cold Chicago winter, with some artificial light assistance. The orchid seemed to be flourishing under this lamp, its a shame that the bulb died in the cheapo fixture after three weeks!!! The bulb didn't just die mind you, nope, the cheap fixture with loose fittings allowed the bulb housing to rotate and loosen further. When I went to tighten the bulb and its housing, the bulb had been assembled with such poor adhesive that the glass piece came off whole from its base that was screwed into the housing in the aforementioned badly assembled from subpar parts fixture!!! How was that for a run on sentence that can be summarized as skip this product that is sold at this price for a definite reason."
2,"Simple Lamp, Cheap Bulb","Upon buying this lamp, make sure you purchase a few light bulbs. The bulb will go out in 10 days usually. No wonder it is so cheap."
3,"It wasn't the product, but the user . . .","This is a good grow light, but it was inappropriate for what I hoped to do. Still, if you want to support a house plant through a dark winter, grow herbs indoors, or something equally small, then this is a good deal. It is fairly low powered, though, so it is best for houseplants that need low light conditions."
4,"Fell apart, returned","Well, I bought two of these. So far one is holding together ok, It is using the bulb that came with the other one because that bulb fell off the part that screws in to the socket. I removed the remainder and was going to buy another bulb. Then the other one started having the shade fall off as the aluminum threads were stripped and/or there was an insufficient length to screw in well. After fiddling with it I sent it back. I am now looking for another brand to try for my seedlings and indoor tomatoes. I am down to one and hoping that it holds up."
2,Not Completely Sold,"I know this was something new for this author and I have read Winter Palace, that is why I was a bit disappointed with this one. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention. I just did not believe the characters. I kept waiting for it to get better which is why I toughed it out to the end, but I was disappointed overall."
1,Accuracy?,"I looked at this guide to see what might be found in my local area and my state. I was surprised to find his entry for Grau Mill in Quincy, IL. He's correct that Quincy was an important underground railroad stop, unfortunately Grau Mill is not there. After doing some checking to make sure, I can only assume that he's referring to Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL. The details match, including the location at the intersection of York and Spring Roads. Unfortunately, those roads are in Oakbrook, which is about 275 miles from Quincy. I would be wary of trip planning with this book."
3,ZOOTED!,"These dudes lay down some phat groovin' beats laced with cool samples and bass. Their lyrics are largely about smoking herb and having a good time. This CD is a blast, you can practically get a contact buzz from listening. Get the rasta red eye going for this one...My favorites include: ""Legalize IT""/""Hemp Rally""/""Many Clouds Of Smoke""/""Zooted""/""Hemp Hemp Hooray""-This is a totally educational and interesting song with real facts about hemp and history."
5,You know their the macks when they smoke their dank sacks,"This one will get you lyricaly high, phat beats, tight lyrics, and a style all their own. If you enjoy getting twisted and sittin back listening to something that isn't on the top forty, this is for you, It's all about smoking so enjoy that type of hip hop, comparable to, but different than Cypress HIll. Buy IT."
5,This album bumps hard.,"In their battle for leagalization, they have voiced their opion to lyrics and phat bass hits if they ever come out with more albums I'm going to be first in line! Keep smokin'phat ones hommies. Peace- taiosm"
3,pretty good,"Michael's song always make me forget everything else ,that is some kind excellent feeling ,do you think so ?"
3,Better left to the professionals,"I wish Ms. Butler would lighten up a little, make the instructions less complex and the whole experience more fun."
5,Not bad,This is a really good dvd. She does go kinda fast for the hard shoe practice but over it is good.
2,Not for a beginner.,"I bought this DVD for my daughter and I who have been taking Irish Dance classes for a year from an extremely reputable touring dance group. I thought this DVD would reinforce what we have been learning. However, it didn't reinforce even one step at the beginning level. It seems like it would be great when you get to the hard-shoe level. However, we are both still working with Ghillies (soft-shoe) and I didn't see her teach one dance step that we have learned in a basic Reel.I was also a bit disappointed in the music. I was expecting traditional pipes and just couldn't seem to get into... what at times seemed like Asian music that didn't fit the dance.If you are a dancer that is more advanced than we are, then this might be great. However, if you are a novice like we are, then I would look into purchasing some of the DVDs that are offered on some of the Irish dance and piping websites."
3,"Great ""Instruction"" Video","This ia a great video for anyone wanting to learn how to Irish Dance or is looking for a good exercise video. Not enough actual dance sequences to suit me, but the instruction is good and it's great to watch these wonderful dancers."
2,Not good for beginners,"It seems that this is the ONLY video out there to try and learn Irish Dance. I'm sure it's great if you already know how to dance, but as an absolute beginner, it just wasn't helpful for me and my friends."
2,Not impressed,"This seems to be the only DVD out there to help people learn Irish Step dancing. Alot of her ""performances"" on the DVD do not seem like traditional dancing (some steps are, but not many). Definately not for someone wanting to learn the basics!!"
3,OK Not Great,"I am a beginner, as this DVD states, it is for the beginner. Well not all, but most of the sets go so fast there is no way it keep up, yet it is amazing to watch these great dancers. The sets start off in an average pace and just go too fast to keep up, for the beginner at least. Some of the positions it was hard to tell where their feet were placed and some of the segments they just assume you already know what they're talking about. I give it 3 stars because this type of dance is amazing and Jean Butler is great. I recommend this for those with a little experience at least."
5,Very Fun!,"This DVD is a great thing for anyone intersted in Irish dance! As a complete beginner to it all, I have found it very useful, even though it was actually made for helping prior dancers practice. When you don't know what a term is that she says, you can go to the Glossary, and there you can get an explanation. You also can string a bunch of lessons together so you can practice them easily. The only thing that could be better for me is if I could have a real teacher!"
4,Not a beginner dance instruction,"If you know the basic steps of the Irish dance, then this is a fun way to practice as if you where part of a dance troup. This deffinately is not for a person who has never done an Irish or Scottish dance. Much to fast, each step is not broken down for the beginner."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This DVD is terrible & BORING! I was looking for a more coreographed routine and this is pointing your toe & jumping. The instruction is minimal. It was a waste of my money. If anyone wants mine I'll sell it to you for half price. Definetely do not buy if you are a beginner & if you are advanced you will be bored to tears.
3,jean butler's irish dance video,"It is a good instructional video, but not the best for total beginners. You have to consistently pause, fast-forward, rewind. If you have the patience and determination then you could do well with this video."
4,great idea for irish dancers,"I am an intermediate irish dancer and i bought this video to help me practice, because i get bored practicing by myself. It was a fun workout, and I appreciated that there was core work and stretching to round it out. However, I was lost on a lot of the advanced hardshoe work that was not clearly explained. I definitely would not recommend this video for someone with little or no irish dance experience. The video teaches no dances, just a lot of drills. This is perfect for me, but for people who don't go to an actual irish dance class, it wouldn't really teach much actual dancing."
2,Called MASTER class for a reason,"I would have rated this higher if I wasn't so frustrated with it. I read mixed reviews about it some saying it was good for beginners and some saying it was bad for beginners. I have a passion for Irish dancing, so I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt.... wrong choice. This is too hard to follow for a beginner. It moves very quickly, even in the introduction of the move. She does it slowly one time and then moves into doing it quickly. It is NOT for beginners. This is perfect for someone who has adequate to master experience with Irish dancing. If you are a beginner however, find some other resource for introducing yourself to Irish dancing."
3,Irish Dance for Irish Dancers' Exercise,"I did in fact read other reviews about how this was not a DVD for beginners. I completely understood this and liked that fact because I prefer my exercises to be upbeat and difficult, but this just could not keep my attention. It was very drone-like in its manner; giving you the steps one after another and just going through. I imagine if you are a dancer and need something to exercise to, this would be all right. For someone wanting to learn in an exciting new way, it just wasn't cutting it."
1,Boring,"I tried to get through this book but I cared so little for the characters (many with really annoying names) that I stopped. I bought Foreigner, thinking if I read that, I'd enjoy this sequel more, but I couldn't get past the first few chapters. I wasted money twice!"
3,I'm writing this review because I'm high,"This song is really funny, but it drags on for too long and it just gets boring. It's good for the first few times you listen to it, but you easily get sick of it."
1,WHAT IS THIS?,"I think this song is absolutely pathetic, it's boring slow beat is annoying and not worth listening to.The lyrics are pathetic and stupid.This song is a joke and it went to number one, people try hard to get into the charts,Afro Man has just realised this song for a joke.The rubbish lyrics,bass and drum beat are dissapointing."
3,Works well but has interface problems with Mac OS 10.3,"Works as advertised but refuses to acknowledge acceptance of set-up instructions and irritatingly asks everytime a new user logs on. We use Mac OS 10.3.9. We found a fix for 10.4 on the HP Support page, but it was very complicated and didn't work for us. We'll check the HP site again in future in the hopes a diffferent fix will work for us. The printer itself was a breeze to set up, works fine, and delivers clean, sharp copies. The problem is with the software."
1,BAD SOFTWARE AND PAPER HANDLING PROBLEMS,The Officejet 4215 is a terrible printer with even worse software. After a month the HP would not load paper without loading 4-5 sheets at a time to print. Before you buy this product ask others who have owned it for more than three months.
5,Excellent basic all in one,"This unit has worked well for all modes (printer, scanner, fax and copier). The print quality is excellent which is why we picked the HP. It prints relatively slow but this is an excellent machine for the price."
1,JUNK,"Only one word to describe this made in china is JUNK hasn't work since it was purchased and HP customer service won't help with out buying a contract and the ink is too expensive, sorry I gave away my lexmark that still worked"
1,This is the worst printer I've ever owned.,"I hate this thing so much that I was moved to write a review...and that never happens.It worked ok for the first few months, but now I can't get it to print even one page now without some kind of an error or a paper jam. The copy/scanner part works fairly well but the scan quality isn't really very good. Hey, but the fax part is bullet proof."
2,Not that great,"Bought this as I needed a good cheap printer to print and maybe fax occasionally.It prints slow 17ppm? maybe 3-5 if your lucky. Paper jams unreal- w/only two peices of paper in the tray it will start jamming for NO reason, and you clear it and it jams itself all over again.WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN. You get what you pay for.For Faxing? it does a good job as long as you dont fax more than 5pages at a time other wise will grab 3-4 pages at one time so you have to refax whole reports over again.s"
