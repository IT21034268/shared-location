5,Key Of Knowledge,I enjoyed reading this book. I read one and rushed back to buy the next one because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Fantastic writing. I always enjoy reading your books. :)
5,Amazing,Another wonderful addition to Nora Roberts` career. Book 1 & 2 are simply breathtaking!!! Well worth the read. A true 10!!
5,Key of Knowledge,"This second book in the Key series is Dana Steele's story. Her counterpart in the search for the second key is Jordan Hawke. Dana and Jordan have a long history. Jordan is Dana's brothers' best friend, so their relationship started out with friendship, but turned to love. He broke her heart when he abruptly left town after the death of his mother. Jordan has returned as a successful writer, but also with a history attached to Warriors Peak. He has always been fascinated with the old house, so much so that he based one of his best selling books on it.As Dana and Jordan search for the second key, it becomes apparent that they must resolve their past, and look into their future together if they are going to locate the second key. The evil foe Kane that was introduced in the first book, is playing dirty and deadly now."
3,Doesn't Live Up To The First Book In The Series,"This book was not as good as the first in the trilogy. Dana was an annoying character who couldn't get over the fact that her heart was broken by the man she loved when she was 20. When Jordan walks back into her life eight years later, she is determined to hate him and keep him at a distance. Unfortunately, most of the story is about her trying to avoid Jordan and get him out of her system.The plot about searching for the key to unlock the souls of the goddesses seemed to be an afterthought. Dana spends most of her time searching through books with the word ""key"" or ""goddess"" in the title, hoping the key will fall out of one of them. Throw in a few events with Kane, the evil god and that pretty much sums up the entire plot. This book is necessary to read if you want to finish the series, but not worth keeping on the shelf."
5,Nora Roberts at her best,"I waited anxiously for the release of Key of Knowledge, and I was not disappointed in the least. Previous fans of Nora Roberts's trilogies will be pleased because Key delivers a wonderful romanace about ex-lovers reconciling and falling in love again, where previous book Face the Fire disappointed. Jordan and Dana are quick witted characters who will make you laugh and possibly cry. Added to the main plot, the story of Mallory and Flynn from Key of Light continues and the story of Key of Valor is set up. All the while the reader works along with Dana in her quest to find the Key, and possibly herself. This is Nora Roberts at her best, giving readers a fun, intriguing, heart warming book. I hope other readers will enjoy."
4,Another keeper,"This 2nd book in the trilogy doesn't disappoint. Here we follow Dana and her quest for the key. I won't give the story away in spite of the fact it's rather predictable how it all turns out. The getting there is the fun part anyway. If you're anything like me, you'll cry and laugh right along with the characters. Enjoy!!"
4,An enjoyable read!,"I stopped reading Nora Roberts' books several years ago as they began to seem redundant. However, this Key trilogy was entertaining, and better than expected. I read all three, but this one was my favorite. Attractive characters, steamy love scenes -- what's not to like?"
2,Not a Nora Roberts book,"I am a huge Nora Roberts book and have read nearly everything she's written. This series does NOT read like it was written by Nora Roberts at all ... the writing styles are very different. I wouldn't be surprised if she used a ghost writer; there's just too much that doesn't seem like typical Roberts. The books themselves are OK, but not nearly as enjoyable as other Roberts' stuff. Stick to her earlier work."
1,Predictable and Boring,The characters in this book were sooo predictable. There was no plot and the characters are NOT well developed which makes them uninteresting.
1,They want to fool you with the size of the box,Don't be fooled with the size of the box. Exactly 40% of that is just a paper. I hate when manufactures try to fool customers increasing the visible size of the package.
2,still chipped,I am disappointed to say my nails chipped in two days. I bought it because of the great reviews but sad to say it didn't live up to the hype.
4,Useful,"The product is useful for a double vanity, which I have. It was just what I was looking for to serve as a handtowel holder on my vanity."
5,Awe Inspiring,"Sons of Somerled is a magnificent work by a truly incredible artist. I first heard this haunting CD in 1998, while searching for a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, who is of Scottish decent and very involved in his heritage. I only listened to the introduction of the first few songs and I knew immediately that I had to have this CD. McDonald has captured the essence of Scotland and it's history on this CD. The follow-up to this album ""Stone of Destiny"" is equally as good and I look forward to his third production. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Celtic music and the magic that surrounds its history."
5,Absolutely Celtic! Unlike anything else on the market.,"Loch Lomond brought instant tears to my eyes - what passion! Steve is a very talented artist, with a voice that soothes, and moves!His versions of folksongs are modern, yet familiar."
5,Makes Me wish I were Scottish,"Wow!!!! It makes me want to get out my bodhran, dance around the fire, invoking the spirits of my UK ancesters. Male version of Loreena McKennit or Connie Dover. The music is tight, vocals are stunning, the drums and bagpipes utterly compelling. We want more."
5,Scotland Shall Rise Again!,"I was in a ""New Age"" type of store when I heard the song ""Loch Lomond."" I've always liked the song, but this rendition was very powerfull and full of life. I bought the CD immediately, and I'm happy that I did.I've always enjoyed rock ballads, but this CD is even better. It is Scotland in musical form.My favorite tracks are ""All You Can Know"" and ""Come to the Isle of Skye."""
5,This Album Is Very Impressive,"I was first introduced to Steve McDonald via this album. It is an excellent collection of songs that can draw forth many emotions. This album is probaly the best out of this series. He has 3 other albums that follow in the same vein, Stone of Destiny, Highland Farewell, and Legend. Each of those albums is Excellent, but they are all very different. I think that this album is still the best, even after listening to the other 3 cds many Many times over, I keep on comming back to this album. I don't think that there is even one song that I don't care for, I can't say that about the other albums, Well, yes I guess I can, but for some reason, this album is still my favorite collection of Steve McDonald songs. Get this album and let yourself be taken away on a journey through a Celtic soul."
4,Purchased at a Winery,"I purchased Sons of Somerled on a whim while at the McGregor Winery/Vineyard in New York. A Steve McDonald CD was playing in the background. The album is very good and did bring chills in many instances. It could have used a little more bagpipe and a little less of the ""echo-ie"" background voices. But it did make me think of what Scotland might be like (I have never been there). McDonald has a good voice but not great, like some of the female Celtic singers. Many of the songs sound alike. It is impressive how old Scottish standards are interwoven into modern synthesizer music. I definetly liked it the more I played it! So play it more than once, and play it loud."
5,Great work!,"Another Triumph by Steve McDonald. I really enjoy the vocals, and the blending of the bagpipes with the rest of the orchestra gives an ethereal quality to the music. I gave this five stars because they didn't have six."
5,I Love This CD!,This CD is wonderful. I finally found this CD on Amazon after wearing out my original copy years ago. I listen to this for hours. The songs are beautiful!
5,Makes you want to be Scottish,"This is a wonderful, mellow, and beautiful CD. I listen to it all the time. Very moving, gives me the goose bumps to listen. Very emotional."
5,TOTALLY SATISFYING,These cookies are fantastic. They taste so good. I had been looking for years to get some more and was very happy to find them!!
5,Fire Prayer by Denean,"Love it. I had bought a copy of this many years ago, and some how it got lost in one of my moves. I recently decided to see if I could find a copy after so long, and Amazon came to the rescue.It may not be 'your cup of tea', if you like something loud and clashing, but for relaxing it can't get any better. This is a classic which I enjoy while driving, and when I just need to unwind.It's Native American type music, drums and rattles - and beautiful words, if you listen to them and 'see' their meaning."
2,For die-hard Conrad fans only,"And I thought I WAS a die-hard Conrad fan! He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all. Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as anything Conrad has done, ""Tether"" is a let-down -- astoundingly depressing! Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring, yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure it all; ""Tether"" holds out no such hope. It concerns a captain who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so in order to provide for his family. Nothing turns out okay, and no one ends up happy. I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but at least a little!"
4,Short but sweet,"My only real gripe about this book is that it was too short. Because Ellis has such an ability to produce readable history books, I believe a 700-page book on Washington would have been more valuable and not been too bogged down in detail. In fact, there is so much about the American Revolution that is not discussed in this book. That was a bit disappointing.On the positive side, it's a very quick read and informative. I learned a great deal about Washington's temperament and his relative sensitivity to criticism, which surprised me. The book was naturally pro-Washington, not that anyone could really justify an anti-Washington stance. Ellis gives Washington perhaps too much credit for liberating his slaves in his will; Washington could have made a greater impact by freeing them while he was alive. Regardless, this is a great book for someone with minimal history background because it's short and easy to follow."
4,Excellent!,"This book does an excellent job of showing the very human side of George Washington. There are some parts that offer unnecessarily-detailed descriptions of surrounding events. However, for the most part it is a very helpful synthesis 1000s of pages of information that shed light on his personality and overall life story. I definitely recommend it! Washington's God is another wonderful book on George Washington."
3,Unsatisfied,I was somewhat disappointed with Ellis's portrayal of George Washington. To me it seemed that more time was put into discussing his faults rather than his successes. If I didn't know any better I would have come away from reading this book with a rather unimpressive view of Washington.
4,jlinder review,Good job in that it is a well written and objective presentation of a complex man of his time and one who could dominate a hall or a barrack or ball with his presence. I enjoyed it thoroughly and will pass my copy to a grandchild as one of the good things.J L Linder
4,Great book--Washington gets his due,"Ellis has come into his own of late, deservedly so. I bought this because I liked Founding Brothers, and was rewarded for the effort."
3,"not bad, but there's better I think","The tone of this book is a bit cold and academic. The information is there but the read wasn't really enjoyable. It was at times very dry and sometimes cynical, not showing Washington (his actions or intelligence) in the most flattering light.I read 'The Real George Washington' a few months later and enjoyed it much more. It was a positive and patriotic book. TRGW was three times longer (900 pgs but a faster read somehow?) and includes many paintings, and maps of historical figures, locations and battles, there are only a few pages of illo's in 'His Excellency. At the end of TRGW there were also a few hundred pages of his personal and public letters; it's a superior book in my opinion.Again, 'His Excellency"" wasn't bad, but it is a short book, 275 pgs, and feels more like a cliff notes version of his life. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in getting a glimpse at Washington's life but not to anyone wanting a more in depth look."
1,Hard to forget Ellis' past mis-history,"George Washington is my favorite historical character, and I've read a number of GW biographies. When I heard that Ellis had written a GW biography, I hoped that my interest in Washington--and the anticipation that I would find out something new about him--might help me to overcome my memory of Ellis' deliberate ""mis-history"" as a teacher at Mt. Holyoke (Google ""Joseph Ellis Holyoke"" if you don't know or remember the details). Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find little new...or interesting, for that matter. There are a number of good Washington biographies available, and I think this book will probably be a disappointment to most who buy it thinking that it adds to what's out there already."
1,Character Assassination,"It is sad. The author has made big bucks on a book that essentially is aimed at bringing George Washington down to the level of today's politicians. There certainly is an audience for this kind of interpretation of our Founding Father and it can only be accomplished by someone who has a perspective and wants to use his skills to slant the reader's view toward his own negativity. I much preferred to read David McCullough's history, ""1776,"" which dwells primarily on Washington as a person and a leader, but without the hidden agenda (whatever it is) of the author of ""His Excellency,"" which is really an attempt to rewrite history and bring Washington down to the level of a Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon in a colonial setting. Shame on you, Mr. Ellis, although you are entitled to your opinion -- which is what this book is all about."
5,Eloquent and Balanced Portrayal,"This is an eloquent and judiciously balanced overview of Washington's life and legacy. Does not seek to judge him by today's standards, but recognizes his greatness in his own time"
4,His Excellency: George Washington,"Great prospective on The Father of our Country. Interesting things about him that are not learned in history class, i.e. he did NOT chop down the cherry tree!!"
3,Neutral and Stale - a competent overview but a boring read,"The ever-statuesque Washington, while remaining first in the hearts of his countrymen, remains ever-aloof, even after this effort by Ellis. Perhaps we will never know Washington the man, thanks in no small part to Washington's own concerted effort that we only ever know Washington the icon, but I didn't find this book nearly as enjoyable or penetrating as Ellis' review of Jefferson in American Sphinx. Ellis works hard to give us a neutral portrait of His Excellency, but the result is as wooden as Washington's infamous (and erroneous) teeth. This is certainly not the book to excite you about Washington, and it's not the book for those looking for an appreciation of what this amazing man accomplished and the crucial centrality of his role in the birth and early success of the American republic. It is a neutral and ultimately unexciting analysis that fails in what appears to be its essential mission - to better understand Washington the man."
4,The good AND the bad reviews have merit...,"A nice, accessible bio of the first president. The bad? The author does, as a previous reviewer states, seem to presume quite a bit regarding how G.W. was feeling or his innermost thoughts. The revisionist claim is merited, in my opinion.Overall, a very nice read, though. The first half seems to be a treatise on how and why Washington was not as great as we think he was, but the second half really shines a good light on him. Perhaps the complimentary tones of the second half carry more weight because of the rather unflattering tones of the first half. Note -- the ""half"" divisions are of my own creation and do not reflect actual chapters or divisions created by the author."
4,The Pendulum Comes to the Center,"Other non-scholarly treatments of Washington to which I have been exposed tended to fall into uncritical hero-worship or arrogant iconoclasm. This is a highly accessible, well-written introduction to our chief Founding Father that is honest and well ballanced. Washington is presented as often arrogant and as making mistakes based on a rashness of character linked to a perhaps inflated sense of honor. The flip side of this analysis is that it makes clear that this great man, complete with flaws, was uniquely gifted and dispositioned to play an inimitable role in the shaping of our early national identity. Real hero, real flaws...isn't that to be expected in a book about a very real George Washington? Some of the other reviewers need to lighten up and get real!"
4,Interesting but not great,"I thought the book was good, but left me wanting more. I wanted more detail of the Revolutionary War. I learned a lot, but somehow, felt I did not get the complete description. As a former Army officer, I would have liked more about his resignation from the Army ceremony, more on Army command. Good, but I'm shopping for another Washington biography."
3,Good but not totally accurate,"Well written, but Ellis completely tries to eliminate the faith of George Washington which is well documented in his Prayer Journal. IN he prayer jouranl he specifically diplays himself as a Christian and names Jesus Christ as his savior too many times to count. I would recommend people read William J. Johnson's George Washington, the Christian."
5,One of the Best,"I am a fan of Joseph Ellis' and of George Washington, and this book fit with my joys. George Washington has not recieved enough credit for his failures and accomplishments in life and for this nation. Revisionist history paints a much darker piture of Washinton and the founding fathers. but Ellis places Washington in the perspective that he deserves. As Lincoln and the Civil War proved, ending slavery would have caused a divide in this nation that Washinton wanted to avoid, but he knew the wrongs of slavery and attempted to make some rights (his will). I strongly recommened this book because it does not gloss over Washington's flaws, it is a honest history."
4,A good introduction to the subject,"A lot of the other reviewers have hit on the brevity of this work, the fact that it focuses on topics and themes rather than a blow by blow account of the Great Man's life, and it's balanced approach against making GW a deity or a devil.I've been trying to figure out why I was disappointed with this book, and I think the reason is that GW had such a rich life and was such an ""indispensable man"" that I would have liked Ellis' thoughts more developed on such issues as GW's military evolution, his thoughts on the constitutional process, attitudes toward the articles of confederation, and on the presidency of his successor, which is a good thing if you are curious, because this introduction will leave you wanting to find out more.In sum, it has all of the strengths and the weaknesses of an introductory survey. It is intelligent and well-written, and if you are casually interested in GW or want to reacquaint yourself with his story, this is a very good book to read."
2,the de-mythed myth,"While it's totally hip to de-mythify things our parents (silly things) thought were good, Ellis's de-mythification of Washington is not satisfying. His basic thesis is that Washington was a nincompoop who happened to be in the right place at the right time his whole life. That's unlikely, and it doesn't explain why Washington was a legend in his own time as well as our own, unlike most ""mythical"" legends, whose myths grow in time.Five stars for doing what everyone else does.Two stars for insight."
3,No active footnotes? (Kindle edition),"(This review refers to the Kindle edition.)His Excellency: George WashingtonSampling the Kindle edition, there are no active footnotes. What was the publisher thinking?!Otherwise, it looks like a great biography of Washington. However, I'll have to pass on the e-book until this flaw is corrected. Hence, three stars."
1,Save your money,"The author of this book is someone who is rewriting history from his own perspective. The book is filled with facts (actual dates, places, and documents with references), however, each one is laced in the authors personal views and personal analysis which is not a positive for George Washington, nor factual at all.George Washington is portrayed as a self-centered egotistical maniac who slaughtered thousands of people (American soldiers) just to satisfy his personal goals and pride.The author makes continuous psychological and personality analysis that are not even possible with the information available and even if it were, I doubt the author is qualified.If you want to read something about one of Americas greatest personalities from the perspective of Today's spin doctors in the media, then this is the book for you."
1,Don't bother with this one,"So after the first chapter I have found out Washington was a liar, a mass murderer, and a coward. I have tried to read this book on several occasions as it has been in my library since I foolishly purchased it shortly after it came out. Now that I am two chapters into it I will put it down and not waste anymore time on this revisionist history.Joseph Ellis has been proven a liar and was put on leave from Mt. Holyoke for dishonesty. Look it up. It's not surprising that a dishonest man like Ellis would seek to tear down the image of a man who had so much to do with shaping the ideals and values of the founding of country.I would recommend the Flexner volume over this or The Real George Washington. The title of this book (His Excellency) should have given Ellis's intent to besmirch the character of Washington away."
1,His Excellency George Washington,"Blah,blah,blah fact after fact after fact. Slow, boring. The writer is definitely a master of the historical facts but his story telling, or lack thereof, left me wishing my book club had chosen another title."
2,Author ought to be tarred and feathered.,"There is a subtle lie promoted in this book. It has to be subtle because to state it plainly would expose the author to the punishment I proscribe in the title. Ellis sublty insinutaes that Washington risked his life, reputation and fortune, and endured unspeakable hardships for the sake of his generation and all to follow (not only in America, but whereever freedom is coveted) all because he was angry at the British for picking his pocket. I am surprised other reviewers on this site don't at least mention it, let alone wail over it. Obviously, Ellis has never suffered, or risked much, because there ain't no way George Washinton was motivated by nothing more than his bank statement. I did give the book two stars because this book is not a piece of trash. Ellis is no fool. I have to give him credit as an author and scholar. Too bad he sees valor as a cover for pecuniary gain. He IS entitled to his opinion, no matter how wrong it is."
3,Limited -- There are better books available,"Although this is a decent short biography of George Washington, it in no way is as complete as Ron Chernow's ""Washington: A Life"". To me there are three major deficiencies in this book. First, Ellis makes several references without explaining them. You may not get the reference if you have not read other works about Washington. (Example: Washington's desire to retire under his own vine and fig tree). Second, early on Ellis tosses out the analysis that Washington was not a religious man. He does not provide any substantiation for his reasoning, yet there is plenty of evidence that points to the contrary (see ""George Washington's Sacred Fire"" by Peter A. Lillback). Third, Ellis seems to delight in casting Washington in an inhospitable light whenever possible. While I am sure Washington was as human as the rest of us with his own unique foibles, I got a little tired of the tenor in this book.In short, read Chernow's book and skip this one."
2,Irreverent portrait,"Joseph Ellis writes and interesting, yet irreverent, portrait of our first president. If you are looking for an immature view of a man, this is your book. The facts presented are accurate. The words used are what you would expect from a college freshman who could care less about the subject, George Washington. Knowledgeable and accurate, yes. But the author is very juvenile in his presentation."
4,Beautiful vanity,"The vendor was extremely responsive regarding the status of my order and date of delivery. It was very well packed, and when I assembled it, there were no scratches, cracks, etc. The finish is frail, so therefore, do not let the side mirror panels hit the center panel, the finish will chip off. It is a beautiful piece of furniture for the price."
4,Great CD,"I bought Tommy Greers three cd's, becoming one, here on cloud nine and angels kiss. Angels Kiss is by far the best cd, Becoming One is my second favorite, and Cloud Nine is a high third."
5,Absolutely delightful!,"Schiffhorst's ""It's Great to Be a Ghost!"" is a must-read. While it's geared towards elementary schoolers, I would recommend it to anyone. The stories of Giggles the ghost and her friends are so fun and enjoyable! Your child(ren) will appreciate these magical charming little stories, and as a parent you will remain confident that he or she is learning some very important lessons too - tolerance and respect for all religions and people - even if they are green or blue! The large easy-to-read print, imaginative plot lines, and adorable illustrations will keep your child(ren) interested and their imaginations running wild! Kudos to Lynn Schiffhorst for such delightful well written stories - I hope to see more of her work on bookshelves soon! A true treasure that belongs in every elementary schooler's collection... Purchase it, read it, and enjoy it - you won't be disappointed!"
5,It's Great To Be A Ghost,"I gave this book after reading it myself to my neighbor, Sonya, who is 9 years old . Sonya loves the idea of friendly ghosts and was thrilled when she saw the cover with Giggle's picture. These stories teach tolerance and multiculturalism with subtlety. They are informative, colorful stories that even adults can enjoy. My personal favorite story was about the Thanksgiving cat. And the great thing about Amazon is that the books arrive quickly. My order was even individually shrinkwrapped. Good choice and because it's a reader, it both educates and entertains. Good show, Lynn Schiffhorst!"
4,Yum!,Brach's Solid Milk Chocolate Stars are the best for making Peanut Butter Blossom cookies. They are a must have around our house every Christmas.
1,TERRIBLE,"BRACHS WAS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST WHEN IT COMES TO CHOCOLATE BUT WITH THE NEW PACKAGING COMES A NEW FORMULA AND THEY ARE TERRIBLE IT DOSEN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE.I WILL NEVER BUY BRACH AGAIN UNTIL THAT SEND OUT A NEWSLETTER ON THE BAG AND ON ALL THE SITES THAT SELL BRACHS STATING THAT THEY WENT BACK TO THE OLD RECIPE,THEY HAVE LOST A VERY GOOD CUSTOMER"
5,Best OIF documentary,"This is by far the best war documentary that covers the current conflicts. I am a Soldier with 2 tours in Iraq and I think this story is amazing. The actual Documentary itself was very well made and the whole thing is a tear fest. It is insane what these guys went through and I think every American should watch this film, these Marines of Lima CO are an inspiration for me. I am a Combat medic (the equivalent of a Corpsman) in the Army and for those of you that want to see the average experiences of the infantry in Iraq, this isn't average, this is the worst case scenerio.Another film that is worth watching and I think shows the average experience of life in Iraq is Occupation: Dreamland, which follows the 82nd. Another one is Gunner Palace and it does reflect how a lot of support personnel are living in Iraq, yet the troops in it are an embarrassment to the Army. An amazing documentary that covers WW2 is The War by Ken Burns, nothing compares to it."
5,Freedom is not free. God bless their families.,"Our son's next deployment will be to Afghanistan. Therefore, we wanted to get an idea of what he will be expericing. I realize Iraq is not Afghanistan. However, other than the mountainous terrain, he will be doing basically the same thing in Afghanistan that they did in Iraq.I have to say this documentary gave us a ton of insight. We were brought to tears several times and even a few laughs. The respect we feel for those Marines cannot be described in words. They are amazing.If you want to see how it really is, then watch this documentary. And make sure you have a box of tissues, you WILL need them.May God Bless Our Military and their Families !!Renee M."
2,"Good Price, But.....","The boot has a great heel and sole, and the price is good for a work boot. That is the plus side. The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin. I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work."
4,"A study Guide, not a cookbook",".This is the study guide companion to the CIA's Professional Chef 7th Edition. I don't recommend it without the required text, maybe that just the lecturer in me, but this should be used as intended, as part of a set.Again, only for those that are dead serious about food preparation."
3,Good workbook for the CIA Pro Chef BUT,I have been working this book and workbook over for sometime. It has many typos which upset me greatly because someone should have picked up on it...but the overall concept is a good one.
5,Great less-known blues CD,"I never heard of this guy, but after listening to this CD for a day, I ordered all of his others. Good stuff for sure."
5,Go out and buy it,"Up there with ""Live at the Regal"". A can't miss record. When I put this on, people who don't like the blues tap their feet and ask me what I'm playing."
5,One Mad Mummy,It's so hard to get the good endings in this book. I've read this for a lot of times and I haven't had one good ending yet.
1,This Book Has Over 20 Different Endings,This Book Seemed so unlifelike to me but As The story comes to page 115 it gets much more lifelike but who would give twenty thousand dollars to a waiter?
4,Pretty much as expected,"I had never bought tools from this company, but the price was right. They functioned as you would expect, and appear to be of good quality. I haven't owned them long enough to have a problem, but I don't expect any."
3,kidnapped in paradise,Entertaining - certainly better than most videos being offered today. Joely Fisher is nice to watch; but not a keeper.
4,Fun with numbers.,I am a teacher and I wanted to review numbers in a fun way. The students were able to sing along and talk about ocean animals. They were all engaged and entertained. Great video for the little ones.
2,leap frog number ahoy,"I thought that Number Ahoy would be as GOOD as Leap Frog Letter Factor,but it was not. I was very disappointed!"
5,I purchase all Leap Frog Videos,"My daughter loves loves leap frog videos. They are far from low budget dvd's. My child learned all of her letters, sounds, and counting from these vidoes. This is a must have for all toddlers!!"
2,our least favorite leap frog video,"first, i am a huge fan of leap frog, especially the letter factory, which works miracles and i would highly recommend for everyone, so its not like i am a hater. ""numbers ahoy"" however, is lame. especially the part with the sharks' teeth. ugh. there is one catchy song in the beginning but i was really hoping for more than that. seriously, don't waste your time or $ with this one when there are so many other awesome ones available."
1,Disappointing for Leap Frog,"We have 21-month olds twins, who love LOVE LeapFrog's Letter Factory. We were so impressed with the rate of repetition and pronunciation of each letter sound. We decided to try Numbers Ahoy, expecting to find the same level of repetition in learning number sense. However, we were sadly disappointed. They do name each number, however they do not count up to each number (for 5, they say one more than before). This was more of a short movie, than a learning DVD. I was expecting a song about counting and naming numbers. Hopefully LeapFrog will create something to help reinforce learning numbers as a supplement to what the children are learning at home."
2,Not up to par with other leapfrog videos,My 2 year old loves leapfrog..Numbers Ahoy really wasn't as upbeat as the restand doesn't get his attention as much as the rest.The 3 best ones you really should get and I HIGHLY recommend.Let's Go To School - Letter Factory - Talking Word Factory.
5,Daughter's New Favorite,"This video is our 2-year-old daughter's new favorite! She asks to watch the ""pirate adventure"" and sings along when they count. She went from counting 1-2-3 to counting all the way to 13. She has trouble saying ""fourteen"" so she skips it and counts to sixteen. Now, she counts everything she encounters and I love it. I had tried to make counting fun but this video has beat me by leaps and bounds. It's entertaining and educational. Just for reference, her favorite video before this one was Leapfrog's Letter Factory. She still watches that one but prefers Numbers Ahoy. I've ordered Amusement Park Alphabet to give her for her 3rd birthday in March."
3,maybe if older,"I got the Phonics Farm dvd and it was good so we also got this one based on positive reviews. Well, it wasn't bad and she was interested but I guess she was too young for the actual story. We found the pirate character who kidnaps the puppy to be scary and she will only watch it if I am sitting beside her and she is cuddled up for protection from the 'bad man'. So, we watched it once and I put it up for later years."
5,Cute video,My daughter enjoys watching this video over and over again. I cant say it taught her (age4) anything new about numbers she did not know but she does enjoy the video's adventure.
2,LeapFrog,My daughter doesn't like it too much so we don't use at all. The set up seems good enough just didn't hold my child's attention.
4,Numbers Ahoy,Wanted something different than the only other math one. My students liked it but its still not as entertaining as the reading. I do think it is harder to put math to a video though. I love Leap Frog for reinforcement of skills for kids!
5,100% awesome!,"Leapfrog is absolutely amazing! My 20 month old son is learning his numbers! He never used to watch tv, I was never interested in allowing him to watch. We have had these DVDs for only a month and I absolutely positiviely would recommend them to EVERYONE, who would like for their toddlers to learn! I always have a leapfrog DVD, playing! I run an in home daycare and the children (including my own),sing along and try to understand everything!"
2,Not like the Word Factory or Letter Factory,"Have to agree with others on this - this video will disappoint if you liked Talking Words Factory or Letter Factory. The voices are weird and the music seems cheap. This seems slapped together and not what I was expecting. We got this from the library and I am still disappointed!! Buy the Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, Code Word Caper or Math Circus instead."
3,Numbers Ahoy - a bit of a disappointment,"We have all of the LeapFrog learning dvds. My 4 and 2 y/o kids love them and learn a lot from them. Unfortunately, Numbers Ahoy isn't quite as educational compared to the others - to my disappointment. It is basically a cute little story with a minimal amount of counting added in. It had the potential to be really great, but they did only an average job in making it educational. To its credit, it has a few catchy learning songs and my kids do enjoy it. I definitely would recommend the 'Math Circus' over this one."
1,Buy something else,"Ms. Flinders, despite her academic position, seems to hold traditional Christianity, and especially Catholicism, in contempt. Her prejudices show clearly (wondering why Mechthild of Magdeburg hasn't been beatified, much less canonized - read that crazy stuff!), putting her own spin on meanings of the mystics' writings. Perhaps, though, some of her readers will be inspired to investigate traditional Christianity, as opposed to Feminist Theology."
5,Enduring Grace: Living Portraits...,"Enduring Grace: Living Portraits of Seven Women MysticsThis is an old title, but a goodie! The author of this book,Carol Flinders, writes just enough about each of the mystics to keep the reader interested. If you have ever read any of the autobiographies of the mystics you will understand what I mean. Flinders relates the stories of these seven mystics in a way which the reader of today can understand. Some of the feminist issues of the 12th through the 16th centuries are still hanging around today. The mystics are portrayed as deeply religious,empathetic feminists. They fought against an unfair system with grace and were successful enough to be remembered today. I lent this book to a friend. She liked it so much that she bought her own copy. You need to get this book."
2,"Interesting women, Boring book.","Surely I'm not the only one who found this book totally [bad]. The only thing it made me wonder about is how it's possible to write such a thorougly BORING book about such fascinating women. The writing is just dull and full of the author's biases and prejudices, which just aren't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves. It's written in that old-school feminism (negative, no fun) tone that thank God feminism has since moved beyond. My advice: find another book about women mystics not filtered through Flinder's lens."
5,Never The Same Again Because Of This Masterpiece,"I will admit to getting upset when any book of this caliber seems somehow to lose ground so to speak. It is one of the few books among thousands out there that has the capacity to transform your perspective of yourself and the world not to omit your faith in God. Too many books on the subject of Beloved Saints seem to only focus on their masterful greatness to which I could never relate on any level [as a woman being so terribly flawed (yet devoted to my faith of Catholicism)]. This book ever so eloquently and exquisitely reads like a dream and shows how these spectacularly popular Saints had trials and troubles aplenty within-and-without as mortals just like you and me. My favorite cameo is of one Saint who regretted that: she could not bring good will to good works....This is a stunner of a book. A classic for all time. Thank you, Carol Lee Flinders. I believe I am a-little-bit-better of a person - because of your book."
5,Best of the bunch,"Of the US releases for Shonen Knife, I believe this is the best of the bunch. The CD goes through a few change-ups in tempo and is consistantly entertaining. My personal favorites on the album are Tower of the Sun, Explosion and Wonder Wine. But there really is not a lemon anywhere to be found.The bonus part of the album is really neat in the fact that a number of Japanese versions of the songs are included. Which I find just as listenable as the English versions. This I think tells much about the quality of music a band produces."
5,"Big, Heavy-duty Knife","This beauty came as advertised. The workmanship is terrific just as you'd expect an American made knife to be. This knife is top quality and the price is unbelievably low. Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and I plan on owning more Bear & Son knives in the future."
5,Nice knife.,Got this knife as a father's day present. Really enjoyed the beauty and craftsmanship. My wife just won't let me take it to work.
3,Poor design,"When the blade is closed, there is very little resistance keeping the blade from being squeezed too far in (such as snapping the blade closed, or putting it in a tight sheath) and causing a flat area near the tip of the blade.This can be avoided by placing the lock bar pivot pin closer to the front of the knife, or by leaving more space between the spring and the blade's closed position, or by grinding the toe of the tang further forward. Its a fairly common problem with poorly-design lockbacks, and Bear & Son seem to have given it no thought.I give it 3 stars because it's a nice looking US-made knife for the price."
3,Existential robo-noise,"Aleamapper may be a difficult listen even for fans of IDM. Think late 90's Autechre but minus most of the beats and melody. What we are left with then is a whole lot of synchronized electronic grinding and groaning, and although Devine seems surprisingly adept manipulating a great range of subtle distortions, much of it does not add up to a whole lot, while certain go-to sounds tend to make the darker ambient stuff bleed together."
3,Aluminum helicopter abortion,"This record reminds me of an early - Otto Von Schirach -release called ""8000 B.C."" if you dont know who Otto Von schirach is.. FIND OUT!!Alot of this record to me sounds:Wet, Sloppy, Dark, *fungle, and a mixture of bio/mechanicalnoises...In a huge chamber of some kind.Not alot of slammin' sick and crazy beats. Kind of repetitive.If you like ambient It would be great. As for me; I'm too hyperactive."
2,Why reissue this?,"They're reissuing this? Why? This was a half-baked collection of out-takes. Sometimes the songs cut off mid-way. Of all the Rahsaan albums I have, I never listen to this one, and wasn't surprised that it was no longer available. There are so many good original Rahsaan disks out there, as well as good anthologies, this one just adds nothing to what you already know. Even if you're a beginner, get the Mercury Recordings or something better than this."
1,Pretty much worthless,"Our 4 year old received this for a birthday present. The helmet is ok, except that the adhesive pads inside came off the first wearing (and the adhesive got in her hair - what a mess!). The knee and elbow pads are too stiff to stay on her knees and elbows. And they are just a plastic bubble. The first time she fell, the plastic shattered on one of them and made it worthless and dangerous for further use.The big sell point was that it was pink and had the Princesses on it. Why can't Disney make quality products? They sure charge enough!"
2,uncomfortable and painful,"my three year old daughter prefers to fall and get scars than to use these pads. she says these pads are very uncomfortable and they hurt her. when she does wear them, she takes them out after two minutes."
4,Disney Princess Micro Bicycle Value Pack,"My daughter is 4 1/4 years old and just loved this set, the helmet was a really big hit and fit her very well, she didn't want to take it off the first few days naturally. The handlebar bell was nice and works fine though not as nice sounding with the thumbwheel activation as the clapper type but suffices well. Kneepads and elbow pads are sufficient though a bit tight though I would imagine that with use they will stretch out naturally, kinda flimsy I thought but then it's not as if a child weighs a ton and needs Kevlar reinforced pads in these areas. Overall very pleased with this set."
1,Flavor is too strong,"It's a great idea, but the flavor is so strong in the cinnamon and peppermint flavors that I can't eat them. The caffeinated chocolate mints, however, are perfect. In fact, using these for my caffeine addiction instead of Coke or Pepsi has helped me lose quite a bit of weight!"
3,A very sweet style,"Michael Tomlinson is one of the truly nice guys in music. His lyrics are sweet, thoughtful and spiritual. Sadly, his style is still rather simple and provides few surprises or innovations for his devoted listeners. If you want to support someone who genuinely cares about the human condition, this album is for you. If you're in search of a rich musical experience, perhaps another choice would be more appropriate."
4,Great 80s retro horror,Great three pack collection of 80s horror films. While these movies are not the best that came from that era they are entertaining and worth checking out. If you liked them as a teenager they still hold up pretty well today. It's another great additonal to the Roger Corman's Cult Classic series.
5,The absolute difinitive Jimmie Lunceford CD!!!,"If I were stuck on a desert island and I could only take one Jimmie Lunceford CD, Stomp It Off would be it. This CD, surprisingly a US release on Decca, is excellent, and gives one a difinitive overview of why Rhythm was Jimmie Lunceford's business with both takes of their theme song ""Rhythm Is Our Business"" a hauntingly swinging yet beautiful version of ""Sophistocated Lady."" All the songs on this CD are classics, from 1934-1935. Essentail for swing fans."
1,Despicable Display of Bigotry,"The Herb Gardner play ""Conversations With My Father"", which celebrates the protaganist's Jewish heritage on the Lower East Side of New York, contains a gratuitous ethnic slander directed against Italian_Americans in Act One. There is no way any other group would have been so insulted, and of course the Wednesday matinee audience the day I attended roared with laughter at the slur.Herb Gardner was as much a bigot as Bull Connor, but his prejudice was directed against a group that is poliitically correct to slander."
4,Reissue available for less money,"Alice Thornton re-released this 1997 Regency romance under the pseudonym Claire Thornton with the same title as a 'Harlequin Historical'. Save yourself some money and look for it under the pseudonym.At the tender age of fourteen the hero met the future heroine's father under unpleasant circumstances. Fast forward sixteen years later and Lady Angelica Lennard needs the hero Benoit Faulkener's help in finding her brother.Like all good Regency romances with an air of mystery, appearances can be deceiving. Events twist and pull Angelica and 'Ben' in various directions. Angelica wonders if Ben is a rake or a quiet gentleman? Will he help her find her beloved brother? Without giving much else away, if you are looking for an adventure with a dollop of romance try THE WOLF'S PROMISE."
2,Save Your Money,"I concur with the July 9th reviewer as she wrote when she was 3/4 done with the book; it has the craziest, not-to-be-believed plot- and she's sorry she's kept on reading. I am also 3/4 done and I can't believe I am still reading. The first few pages were interesting and then it is all downhill.Save Your Money and buy something else. Wish I would've checked here first for a review!"
1,An incredible waste of (my)time and (the) author's talent.,"Like others I waited patiently for ""Temple's"" story to arrive. I am 3/4th of the way through this book and It is one of the worse books I've ever read. The story line is ridiculous. A beautiful heiress sits idly by for 10 yrs waiting for a man who kissed her once to realize he loves her. In the meantime she plots to force him to come to her aid by dating 3 ""loser"" candidates for her hand. The hero is an English spy superhero, incognito of course, but can't see through her plots and isn't bright enough to manage his own life!! He's also unable to control any of her staged outragious. Pure drivel. My biggest regret is that I kept reading this book, waiting for it to get better. That was a lost cause. It seemed that Temple's story would be an awesome one. Big missed opportunity here, miss boyle."
1,Didn't send the book.,I ordered from these people because they had a high rating. I have not gotten the book and have been notified by Amazon that it was never sent. I have e-mailed them two times and they do not respond. I would definitely never order from them again. I only give them one star because I don't know if you can give them 0 stars.
5,The essential Charlie Barnet recording.,The wonderful recording of Skyliner is worth the price alone.
1,Assembly a nuisance,"The box says that assembly is frustration free. This was anything but that. The assembly was a total nuisance. The instructions were poorly written, and some of the parts did not seem to fit together well. It took over 1 1/2 hours to put together and I have requested a few replacement parts which I hope fit better than those supplied.I am skeptical of the longevity of this product."
4,Radio Flyer Big Flyer,Purchased this for my 4 year old grandson and he loved it! Very good construction and went together easily. All he needed to do was jump on and enjoy!
4,Fun,My grand babies love there big wheels they are 5 and 3 and can't stop playing with them and to find one thing they won't get board with fast is almost in possible very happy with the decision on getting this for them.
3,Too big for my 3 Year old,I bought this for my 3 year old son last Christmas. He is an average size kid. He is now 4 and still has trouble reaching the pedals. I tried to get him to stand and use it as a scooter but that turned out to be a fall hazard. I would recommend purchasing a smaller trike for the 3 year old and saving this for 5 years old or older. I still feel bad that his major Christmas gift was too big for him to enjoy.
2,Important assembly information - to save you frustration,"First off, the two main pieces of the body are molded by some machine which leaves little pieces of hard plastic rattling inside both bodies. If you dont mind the bike rattling like its broken then this is not a problem; otherwise you need to shake the pieces out of each of the parts of the body, kind of like getting a pick out of a guitar. I took off the flag cover part to do this. It was a long and tedious process.Secondly, the instructions have a list of required parts: 2 of these, 3 of these, etc. You'll notice they list THREE of these red plastic caps that you hammer on the end of the dowel holding the wheels on. You will look around and notice there are only TWO in the box, which might cause you to get upset, as the instructions list three. Guess what? You only need ONE which you will only realize by assembling the bike. If that doesnt frustrate the crap out of you on Christmas eve I dont know what will.Otherwise an ok big wheel copy."
1,"Does not fit my 39"" three year old son.","Don't buy this bike unless your son is over 48 inches tall. Roughly 4years of age.My son was at 90th percentile in height at three years old. That makes him 39"" tall. With the backrest on the lowest setting or closest to petals, his feet barely touches the petals with his legs fully extended and can't pedal bike. If he were to pedal the bike straight he will need an additional 3 inches in LEG length not 3 inches in overall height. Also when you turn the bike the pedal on the outside of turn moves even further away so he now needs an additional 3 to 6 inches of leg length to reach pedal. I estimate my son needs a minimum of 6 inches in leg length to reach pedals or 10 to 12 inches in overall height."
1,Too BIG!,"Got this today for my 3 year old son. There is no way this is made for a child of 3, even though the box says it is for kids age 3-7. My son won't be able to ride this for at least a year.Super cool toy, and it seems sturdy enough, but honestly, by the time my kid is big enough to ride the darned thing, he will be riding a bicycle, not a toddler's trike.Massive disappointment for my son who picked it out, and for my husband who wanted his kid to have a big wheel ""like Daddy used to have"". Yeah, except Daddy wasn't riding it around when he was 15, which seems to be the age this monstrosity is built for.Now it just sits creepily in our house with nobody to ride it reminding me of The Shining."
5,Excellent,My son loved his new bike with his flag! He didn't want to put it away for the winter because he enjoyed riding it so much!
2,Will have to replace it.,"My son is almost 4 and is the tallest in his class (by far) and is BARELY able to reach the pedals. The seat won't fit properly into the holes and he has bruises all over his back after riding for a short time, even with a towel behind his back. The screws holding the flag tore out within a week."
4,Hot Wheel,"We bought this for our son's 4th birthday. He's enjoying it. The only drawbacks I've found so far is the flag will not stay up and the seat cut my son's back (I'm going to need to attach a cushion). I grew up with hot cycles though.. I know as he grows it'll be a great toy.. one that provides outside, excersize time!!"
5,Great Tricycle,"Great bike, very durable and easy to put together. This was the easiest bike to put together. I have put together many different toys for my kids and had awful experiences but this bike is a pleasure to put together. It also looks great. I wish i could ride on this thing."
2,Big wheel loose seat,The kids loved it however the adjustable seat does not stay in the holes and falls out while being ridden. This is a definate hazard! We ended up placing lg. Rubber bands around the pegs And this helps to keep the seat in the holes but I'm really disappointed and would Not Recommend for this reason
3,Radio Flyer Gig flyer TM,Its built sturdy. But one problem it was not drilled in one spot where it needed to be connected. We drilled it our selves rather then sending back.
5,Radio flyer,Easy to put together. Great gift. Have had radio flyer products around since I was a little girl. You can never go wrong with their products.
5,Coolest big-wheel out there!,"Cool looking and solid. takes about 20-30 minutes to put together. very straight forward. I have an almost 3yo that is in the 70% height. Not tall enough BUT he should be by spring. He is in love with it.This is hands down the best looking big-wheel I've come across.Cons?? No ""skid"" brake, but we're not at that level just yet!Great buy!! A++"
5,Great bike...,Bought this for my son a year ago when he turned 5.. He just turned 6 and still loves this little bike... It is well made and we've have no issues with it.. His only complaint is the seat back hurts his back some times.. they could have put it at an angle to make it more comfortable instead of straight up and down. I imagine he will get at least another year out of it before he out grows it... Great purchase!
4,"brings back memories, but hard on the riders back","I purchased this for my now 7 year old grandson two years ago. He seems to enjoy riding it, especially now that he is older. He does say the seat hurts his back after awhile (a minor design change in the seat angle would help this issue). It still looks new after two years...and was a great deal at the time of the purchase, I have seen it almost as cheap local stores recently. I would repeat this purchase if needed, but I would wait until the expected rider were 7-8+ years old before getting it."
5,Love it!,"We bought 3 of these for my boys, ages 6, 5 and 3.....they all love them. They fit everyone perfectly with the adjustable seat."
3,Fun but my son lost interest pretty quick,This was easy to assemble but my son had to work really hard to keep momentum going on it. I think rubber instead of plastic wheels would help.
2,missing part,"make sure to check all the parts before assembling. I didn't, and when I got to the final step it was missing a part. Other than that its a very sturdy trike..I returned it and did buy another one."
2,Priced to high,Nice but found the same bike at Walmart for $49. So disappointed that I paid so much more. Wish I had shopped the price around.
5,Love the Big Wheel!!,"Purchased the Radio Flyer Big Flyer for my 4.5 year old son for Christmas, and he loves it!! Had someone put together for me, so can't attest to the ease, but few pieces so didn't look difficult. My son in average to tall for his age and the seat is in the first set of holes so plenty of room for growth. Was afraid at first because it looked tiny, but the extension of legs and upward position makes you have to put them closer than expected to the steering. He loves that he can go ""super fast"" unlike his bike which he needs to practice more and use more muscle strength. Looks really cute, and durable, and the flag is super cool, and a safety feature as I can see the flag if I lose sight of him behind a bush or something, and so can other cars. There is no braking, but low enough that they can stop quickly with feet or do the really cool spin around thing...the older boys and men all stop to reminince about thier days of their own big wheels!"
4,well made,"i like the durable aspects of this as opposed to a regular big wheel, but as other reviewers noted, the pedals are too far for my 2 1/2 yr old son to reach, and he is almost 40 inches!"
5,Radio Flyer,"Bought this toy for my 5 year old, she rides it every chance she gets. My 7 year old also loves it. Great for active kids, well built, easy to assemble."
1,JUNK,"This product is JUNK!!! Made of all cheap plastic, not durable at all. My 4 year old won't ride it nor will any of his play friends. Total waste of money. If u want this item u can have the one I bought for free, really!!"
2,Fun but bruises his back,"My 3 yr old loves this bike. He races around and spins out by quickly turning the handles- this is heart stopping the first time a parent watches. This down side is that he gets bruises on his back every time he rides it. I was very alarmed the first couple times I saw the bruising until I figured out what was causing them (not the nanny!). At 39"" tall he can barely reach the pedals at the shortest seat setting. I think he is leveraging off the top of the backrest to get momentum and causing the bruising. I wouldn't not recommend this for kids until they get taller and can leverage with their legs better."
2,pedal problem,We bought this for my daughter's 9th birthday. Yes she is tiny. She loves it! My only problem is that we have one pedal that is wanting to come off. Other than that it has been well used!
5,THE MOST FUN AND BEST EVER BIKE!!!!!!!!,I bought this for two rowdy boys ages 3 and 5 and they just love it!! The 5 year old just took off and rode it fast. The 3 year old took a few minutes to figure it out but when he did he loved it. He goes at a slower pace than his brother. This is an exellent toy as kids with super energy can ride a long time and then it wears them out for a nap. To be safe i go to a tennis court and they ride around safely. If they get off the court on the grass they find out it is not as easy to ride on grass so they get right back on the court. I also go to Basketball courts. Both bikes fit fine up front in my ford escort so it works out well. They absolutlely love these bikes!!!!!!! Five stars*****
3,Excellent quality but my son is still too young,"Overall, love the quality of the big wheel and easy to put together. The only problem is my 3 year old is still too short to reach the pedals! He can still scoot around, but defeats the purpose. Would suggest that the age range is closer to 4 years old."
1,Misleading bike description,I bought this for my 3 year old son who has always been considered tall for his age and he still can't ride this darn bike because his feet can't reach the pedal when he tries to ride it. The description of the bike says for 36 months but my son is now 3.5 years old and still can't ride this bike. Very frustrating....plus he says the seat hurts his back. Very disappointed in overall purchase of this bike.
3,radio big flyer],"this toy was suppose to be for 3 years and up. My grandson is small, so his feet did not fit and could not peddal. A bit dissapointing for his 3rd birthday."
4,Grandson's fun,My 5 year old grandson loves this Big Flyer. It has 3 positions for the back rest which is a wonderful feature. It can grow with him for a few years at least. A bit tricky to put together but well worth it.
1,Defective - Unable to Assemble,"The manufacturer misaligned the metal plate on the wheel bar, so I was unable to put the wheel on at all because the little plastic fitting didn't go on it. Overall, I was expecting higher quality because of the name, but it's a piece of junk. The entire thing is plastic, no real treads like advertised. The old ones from when I was a kid were much better and had more tread. After 1 1/2 hours of trying to assemble this thing, having taken it apart to see where I went wrong, I realized it was a manufacturer's defect!To make this so much worse, this was my daughter's ""big"" gift from Santa, the one she wanted the most. Now I have a big gift for her brother, and nothing for her. How sad is that!? What a terrible experience. I would recommend getting the Original Big Wheel over this any day..."
1,Measure the height of your child before purchasing!,"Santa gave this toy to our daughter on her 3rd Christmas -- big mistake! It's been sitting in the corner collecting dust, because, even on the closest seat selection, her feet can't turn the peddles. At 3 1/2 and 3ft, 2 inches tall, it will be at least another six months, if not longer, (and she's tall for her age), before she's able to even ride it. while it may be exciting at a taller age, she is asking why Santa gave her a toy she can't use yet. Grrrr."
2,Not very happy,"I bought this for my 5 year old son, after he outgrew his first ""big wheel"" type bike. I am incredibly disappointed and am going to call Radio Flyer to see if they'll do anything for me. The seat does NOT stay on at all, it pops out constantly. The seat is also very uncomfortable for my son (when it stays on) and it hurts his back, so I have to drape a small blanket over it just for him to be able to ride. I'm really disappointed because I was thinking this would last him the next few years... we've only had it a week or so and don't want it!"
4,OUr 4 year old loves it,"We bought this for our son's 4th bday. He had destroyed his older plastic Big Wheel by repeatedly stripping the screws near the handle bars so they kept lifting off. Unfortunately he did the same with this new one - the handle bar was off within two weeks, but we bought new screws and it is holding up now. In general it is solid and strong and a great bike. It would fit an older 3 year old and 4 year olds on the smallest size. Room to grow. The flag is fun for the little ones (although we have stripped a screw in that also! I think my guy is just a little too rough!). He loves the bike."
1,Nice but................,"Dear AllJust a little to share with people who may be intersted in this item. I bought this item because my son always asking for a bicycle. So we decide on purchasing it for him before his second birthday. The color is very nice, durable and have that pimp my ride look. Long and short my son ride this bike every day, its his new best freind on November 06, 2009 he was riding it in the yard when the back part of it i.e. the rest for his back fell out he lost balance and drop back ways on his back burst his head leaving a hugh bump in the back....My problem is that the back rest is not properly made to fit into the holes. I am aware of the issue the 1st time i pushed him myself, but never remember to mention to his grandma that whenever he is riding please make sure to be close to him ,so that this incident could be prevented. Other than the back rest is not properly made if the child is big enough and can manage without the rest then he or she will be fine....."
2,beware the pedals!,This is a pretty solid bike. It is a shame the pedals won't stay on it! They fell off after only an hour. This is also best for older kids. It was way too big for my 2 year old. Seems that if they could make a better design for the pedals and lower the price a bit it would be better.
1,Cheap plastic POS,"I bought this for my nephews 3rd birthday, thinking ""Well it's a Radio Flyer, so I'm sure it's excellent quality""...Boy was I wrong. I don't even know where to begin...the plastic is cheap probably PVC based crap, yep pretty much the stuff they use to make milk containers out of. Brand new out of the box and the stickers are already peeling off . The inside of the toy had plastic bits shaking around. To assembly the toy you need four wrench's (two sizes- one to hold one end and one to tighten, both on different size bolts), a phillips screwdriver and a hammer...so you need 6 tools to assemble a toy...I use less tools to change the oil in my car. Above all else is the total disappointment you feel when you realize something you had as a kid which brings back so many fond memories has started using it's name to sell crap manufactured in Asia. Profits before people...pretty sad...I just hope my nephew likes it anyway."
1,How tall does child need to be?,We bought the radio flyer big flyer May 2011 for our twin grandsons' three year old birthday. They could not reach the pedals with the seat all the way up. They are now fast approaching four years old and still cannot reach the pedals. Any suggestions?
1,Such high hopes,"I bought this for my 3 year old son, but unfortunately he couldn't ride it until months before he turned 5 (and he's in the 75th percentile for height). He rode it all morning in a parade on the 4th if July and later when we went swimming, he had 3 bruises on his back. We could NOT figure out why...until we realized they were in the spots where the hard plastic screws together on the back of the seat. He had complained a little that morning, but we didn't realize what was happening. We bought him a bike that afternoon and threw the big wheel in the recycling- no way I want another child using this product!"
3,GIFT,all I can say about this radio flyer wagon is; They haven't gave me any feedback. You know what they say is no news is GOOD news!!
4,Big Wheel Review,Very easy to assemble. My son is a very tall 3 yr old and his legs are justLong enough to make the pedals go all theWay around. In a few months I expect to seeHim driving all over the driveway!
4,Radio flyer bike,All my grandchildren have one now.They love them.Ages 3 1/2 to 6 1/2Hope to have many fun years with them.My own children had them and they stilltalk about their races.
5,Radio Flyer Big Flyer is a WINNER!!,"I bought this Radio Flyer for my grandson's 4th birthday. He Loves it.When his mother was his age she had a Big Wheel, but the ones outthere now are cheaply made and I didn't care for them. I was happy to findthis one was a quality product, so he could have the same fun experiencethat his mother had as a kid. I will buy it for my other grand children."
5,Son LOVES this and has held up great a year later,"My son got this when he was four. I had to put a towel at first for him to reach the pedals, but he quickly was able to reach. He has loved it from the start, the big wheel really allows him to go fast. His friends and cousin purchased one also, they all have such a fun time racing around on these. They are made well, my son uses it every day (weather permitting), and it is still in great condition. I looked around for a while for a big wheel, and on the advice of my sister (who really researches everything) purchased this as the wheels are durable and will withstand wear. Highly recommend, a must have for a active boy."
5,Good Quality,"I purchased this Big Flyer for my grandson and it arrived promptly. Also, it was fairly easy to assemble. The quality of the materials was very good and I was impressed that it was very well designed. My grandson is enjoying it immensely!I chose this over the ""Big Wheel""; while it was twice as expensive, the quality makes up for the price (I saw the other one at Target and it was made of very poor quality plastic). Sometimes you do get what you pay for!"
5,Tough Bike for my tough little guy!,"Our 3 year old son is a rough and tumble little boy. We had originally purchased one of the fold-n-go trikes but it was constantly tipping over and he was getting hurt. We wanted something he could enjoy riding at top speed without falling off, as well as something of lasting quality. Boy has this big wheel ever delivered! He loves it, as do even the ""big"" kids on our street! We love that the seat is adjustable for when he gets bigger, or when a bigger kid wants a turn. It moves back very quickly and easily. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a great ride for their kids that will grow with them and last. Awesome!"
2,not for 3 year olds...Radio Flyer Big Failer,"This trike is for at least 4 year olds. The pedals are way to far for my 3 1/2 year old to reach. She is frustrated trying to pedal it and has given up quickly. And when the steering is turned, the distance is even greater. I tried taping some cardboard to the pedals to raise the height, but even with that it's too far away! It seems Radio Flyer is trying to widen their customer base by lowering the age for this toy. If your child is below 4 years old, it will be a useless toy for them. Also, the flag was torn out of the tiny screwholes the first day."
2,Beware: no traction at all,"My son was so excited to get this cool-looking trike for his 4th birthday. For looks alone, it deserves 5 points. However, it does not move. The front wheel, which propels the trike, just churns, but does not grip, since it is made of hard plastic. So my son pedals, but he won't get anywhere. We tried it on concrete, asphalt and grass. Unless you are going downhill, it did not budge. The only upside: Amazon's customer service, who took it back although it has been used (or has been attempted to ride)."
4,Excellent introduction for those new to public libraries,"As a student of library science, I was excited to see the unique layout of this textbook. Instead of having chapters on certain public library principles (leadership, collection building, community involvement, etc) this textbook showcases different libraries that have developed REAL programs that exemplify these principles as well as empower staff and the community. I loved being able to read what were basically case studies instead of a dry textbook that droned on and on about public library principles without giving solid examples. I really did enjoy this book as an introduction to the possibilities a career in public libraries could present. If you want more in depth information on public libraries, then I would find another book. But this is both an excellent and interesting introduction."
1,Use this instead of counting sheep....,"With all of the exciting things happening in public libraries today- technology, staff duties, users, collections, programs- this textbook had the potential to be a really interesting book. However, it is not! Basically, this text gives a dull look into 10 different public libraries. It is more like a huge advertisement for these libraries. I have read the first dreadful chapter, and skimmed through the whole thing, and it doesn't look like this text will enlighten me one bit. I hope you (like me) are not forced to buy this for a course."
2,Compatibility Issues,Bought a Starview KVM SV431UADVI only to realize that it does not work with Windows 7 64 bit. Poor support on the website!!
5,What is happening?,"This is, for sure, Mangione's best record.What is happening with the CD version? I mean, is the wife jealous because of he theme?Hope she will reconsider."
2,Should be time for a new edition,I hope someone redoes this book and soon. I would like to see one done with the new things available.
1,Terrible DVD,"When I received this DVD, I was not impressed, The cover art work was cheesey, and the video itself was just as bad. What a disappointment. I returned it without hesitation. I had this title on VHS tape and thought I would upgrade to DVD. I will never purchase another DVD from this company. For the price it is junk. It is sad because these old serials are great. I would suggest shopping somewhere else for this DVD."
4,Signaled in the end of the movie serials,"It took me a while for me to get around to getting this one because there was so many other serials that caught my attention. This serial I kinda expected it would be... Lots of action, but short on substance. Not much to hold your attention on. Sure it's got a shoe string budget, but much better serials was made with that same amount of money.In all honesty I only got this serial just to add to my collection. That's all. It really wasn't the best serial ever produced, and it really was sorta dull. But for those who wants to witness the end of the movie serials, get this one... and while you're watching it...wear black."
3,scifi,"This DVD had nothing to do with Zombies, but was very intertaining. My wife and I remember the Saturdays at the movies watching a seriel such as this before the main feature. We enjoyed the '50's action and take on scifi."
5,Good Video Quality,For fans of Commando Cody and Republic Serials this is nice piece of nostalgia. The video quality is very good - much better than I expected.
3,Personal relation between seven sacred places and the chacras,"The relation between sacred places and human chacras is very personal, as there may be different associations according with the individual conceits and spiritual connection. The book is interesting, well written, with detailed descriptions and historical information, in spite of being very resumed.The meditations are very beautiful and can help people to get in touch with the energies of these seven sacred sites even without knowing them on material level.Recommended for spiritual pilgrims and seekers."
3,Air Hogs Havoc Heli,"I purchased this toy and was very impressed for the first week but had trouble with the downward facing rear stabilizer stem breaking which was minor, then I had a counter weight fall off the top blade and was unable to use. Overall my damage was due to rough handling,it is actually extremely resilient all things considered. This is not a toy for small kids! I would purchase it again."
3,Fun But Breaks Easy,"This was a birthday present for my 7/0 son. He absolutely loved it and it was his favorite present. Unfortunately it is not durable at all and even though he was careful with it, it lasted 2 weeks and now won't fly straight. Fun - YES. Durable - NO."
3,"Fun, but should be made more durable","My 8 year old son got about 3 weeks of wear out of this toy despite being pretty careful. It's too bad, I would've gladly paid another $20 if it would've been made more durable. It now barely gets off the ground. Also, the directions made no sense at all...comical that this was acceptable. I suppose that's the price we all pay for foreign made goods. Save your money and buy a better toy. I would not buy again."
2,Too predictable,"I've enjoyed Hooper's Bishop Triologies, but was disappointed in Rebel Waltz. It was all too predictable. Rory was weak and Banner was childish. And I couldn't stand that he kept calling her ""milady."" Sorry, I must be having a hormone flare up!"
5,Rebel Waltz,So far I have read most of all Kay Hoopers books. They are all a fast read that keep you on edge.
2,disappointed,There is no wires or switch in side just sping steel. After a few weeks of daily use it would get stuck on or off. Get the Bell haeadlights. Tip: get rechargable batteries front headlight drain batties very quickly.
2,Headlight is terrible,"I regret spending my money on this product. The headlight started out working fine but then after about 4 uses I noticed it started going dim. Eventually after about 7 uses the light wouldn't even come on even after replacing the batteries. My ride from home to work is only 5-10 minutes and the light shouldn't have given out this quickly. My advice to you, spend the extra few dollars and get a better quality product. I give this product two stars only because the backlight is still working fine."
2,Not bright enough for night time use.,It looks and feel cheap plastic. Not bright enough for night time use. May be I have way too much expectation but if you are a serious biker get something else.
2,cheap,I bought this set and after one use the headlight stopped working. it also was such a narrow beam of light that all i could see is the light on the road. not the road. not worth the little I paid for it. the tail light worked fine
1,Another terrible product from Schwinn,"Schwinn might make good bicycles, but they offer poor quality accessories. This light set is yet another example. While installing the headlight, one of the hinges broke, so now there is a loose fit. Another flaw is that the light isn't very bright. I know that xenon bulbs are not the same as LEDs, but this is still exceptionally. The rear light is okay, but I have a rear bike rack that is attached to the seat post. If I attach the rear light to the seat post AND an carrying something on the rack, then the light is not visible. I wish that Schwinn had designed a more versatile set that could be attached to different parts of a bike. Simply adding screw holes would have easily solved this problem. Needless to say, I returned this to the store."
3,B&M Unimatic shifter,"This is a very nice and easy shifter to install and use, the one very important thing that is missing is there""s no Reverse lock out from the drive position. I understand that this is not a performance shifter (and that is all the robot from B&M; could say) How about if somebody bumps it while in drive? even a stock car floor shift has a reverse lock out!! Just a thought, not Rocket science B&M.; Maybe listen to your customer instead of argue with him. Too Bad Hurst is gone, no competition is never good for the buyer.CheersCapt Chuck"
3,Smaller than expected,"This shaker appears to be of solid quality and good design, but in my opinion it got hit by the shrink ray. Perhaps I didn't pay close attention to the listed specs but it still seems like it falls short of the expected volume one would assume.Also, even proportionate to it's size the pepper comes out VERY slowly, meaning if you want more than a hint of pepper, you'll be shaking for longer than you'd like.On the plus side, the rubber base is a nice touch and I love being able to see how much is left."
5,A must-have guide for visitors to the middle east!,"This guide is beautiful, complete, and truly in-depth. For example, there is a fold out section showing the route Jesus followed carrying his cross. It notes all of the details including where he fell, where certain icons are -- everything you could want to know. The Knopf Guide also will make a great souvenir of your trip.Contrary to what another writer has said here, this book certainly recognizes Israel. As the Lonely Planet guide points out, there is much in dispute about this area, and it's easy to offend one group or the other. Any attempt to present a balanced view of history and of the three religions which center their faith here must tread carefully with names and facts. The Knopf Guide excels in this area.I'd recommend picking up the Lonely Planet guide for details of accomodation and travel facts, but for the history, architecture, birds, animals, fish, sacredness, and gradeur of the area, this is definitely the book to get!"
3,Knopf Guide to the Holy Land,"While the shipper provided me with an excellent copy and timely service, I was disappointed in the book. The print is very small and crowded on the pages. I found it very hard to actually become interested in it as I thumbed through. Think I will stick with Fodor's next time."
3,Overwhelming Bergamot Perfume,"***This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.***"
3,ok but disappointing guide to provence,"We loved Lazy Days in Provence, a guidebook to some great, largley off the beaten track, restaurants in Provence. It had great advice and an informal style. We bought this guidebook because two of its authors were also the authors of Lazy Days. The detailed info is accurate but the style is deadly. We left it at home and took Marc Fincham's Insight Guide to Provence instead. Suggest you do the same."
1,Steer clear of this unreliable guide.,"Don't be fooled by the witty writing; the writers are either ill-informed or malicious. 2 of 3 hotels they recommended were downright seedy. The Miramar at La Ciotat (three stars, ""a classy, updated old hotel amid pine groves, by the beach"") turned out to be a nicotine-saturated, dimly lit dive that charged our credit card before we arrived (we didn't stay). Pine groves? The hotel sits shadeless on an ugly stretch of tarmac. The ""pine groves"" were a few trees in the parking lot behind the hotel. There are many good guides to Provence; choose another."
4,Mind Candy,"Caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels, I pretty much fell in love with Kathy Long. The movie is interesting, little bits and pieces of a whole lot of other stuff as mentioned in the above reviews, but her character is very much like ""The Man with No Name"" Clint Eastwood features, with martial arts thrown in. Supporting cast is adequate to strong (I particularly liked Ginger Lynn, it's the first movie I've ever seen her in with her clothes on) and the biker gang was convincingly evil, reminiscent of the ""Wild Angels"". The landscape reminded me a bit of Mad Max. No big surprises here, Kathy dispatches the bad guys with relatively grusome ease, and looks great while doing it. I wish the ending would have been a little more definite on her identity, but you can't have everything. Worth watching, definitely not a chick flick."
3,"poor quality, but few alternitives on Amazon","Strung three sets together, as per design, and in a couple months about 1/6th of the lights have burned out. I've had others on the same circuit that have lasted a year with NONE of the bulbs burning out. Le Sigh"
3,It's compilation of GC's three Atlantic-America Lps from 1982-85,"This a remastered comp CD of Campbell's three Atlantic-America albums, OLD HOME TOWN, LETTER TO HOME, and IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME, short a few of the total 30 tracks (three Lps x 10 tracks each). I'd call it worth 2-2 1/2 stars, which is respectable. Not the usual endless reruns of the big Capitol '68-'77 stuff, though. Platinum, well, I think that word inflated: no RIAA gold certified hits referenced from this period, but some nice middling '80s country hits."
1,Not platinum,"Not a single well-known song by Glen Campbell, just a bunch of unknowns. Very disappointing considering the album is titled ""Platinum."" Didn't even listen to it."
2,Wish I liked history...,"I can appreciate the history, truth, and exploration Graves provides, but the book as a novel wasn't something I was interested in. I'd rather read a list of interesting facts about a river than have someone take me on a boring canoe trip down it verbally. I like meat not needless fluff. I am very glad the Graves preserved this for us and hope those who do enjoy a nice mental cruise will indulge in it. However, if you're looking for a moving book this is not it."
3,Brazos River Cannoe trip-,This is an OK book. Exellent story line of a river being dammed up but a dissjointed narative that doesn't peak my interest. Many people liked this book but I didn't care for it. I live in the area where this story takes place so it did have some interesting stories of the Indians in the area.
5,What a wonderful book!,"This is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. It is funny, provocative, and sad. It is very hard for any Texan to see the end of an era, the end of a river. I've read it many times and will read it again and again. I will make sure that my grandchildren read it too, just as soon as their vocabulary and reading skills can handle it. What a sad commentary on our continuing destruction of our natural resources!"
5,John Graves Goodbye to a River,An excellent Texas Writer. I highly recommend this author and expecially this book to any reader. It arrived in excellent condition and very quickly.
4,An eternal capsule that becomes part of you.,"This meeting of the past, the present and the ugly future of change in the form of a passage down a wild river that will be transfomed is timelessly described by an evangelist of observation. You want to be this John Graves, this investigator of what is timeless and human. Excellent!"
5,Purchased as a Gift,Bought this gift as a birthday present for my monopoly-loving mother. She loved the game and immediately upon receiving it wanted to play.
1,out there. WAY out there.,"The author of this book claims just about everything in the world is related to drug smuggling and CIA conspiracies.One of the oddest assertions is that the Nazi Klaus Barbi was a triple agent for the US and USSR, and had a team of commandos that trained the Contras. It's amazing that this book ever got published"
1,not worth the money,I took this class as part of my undergrad work for a business administration degree and was greatly disappointed. It is written for a high school level course not a college level course. Two thumbs down.
4,"Good, but not the best there is","Roger the Chapman is an intriguing character, as are several others in this book. The only real fault I find is that Roger has a few too many ""modern"" habits and sensibilities. For instance: A nineteen year old first time mother was not considered young in that time and place. If you like this variety of mystery though, I would recommend it, as well as Ellis Peter's Cadfael series."
2,Where's the water? My throat is parched!!,"Extremely expensive - ($190.00 is what I payed. After purchase SOMEONE! dropped it to $125.00 What gives???)Extremely dry - (Pass the water... No, wait, I think I'll jump in the ocean.)Yes - I have SUCKER on my forehead."
2,sushi kit II,Product seems okay. It does not come packaged in a basket as a set like I thought it would. It was shipped at a ridiculously high shipping rate and still came in a little banged up. I will not order from this company again. They have terrible customer service. They did not respond to me until I got Amazon involved.
1,Terrible Design-breaks easily,"This cover only attaches at the top (it replaces the viewfinder cover). and can get snagged very easily on the bottom where it is NOT connected to the camera, such as when you put the camera in your bag. Mine is broke, so now the viewfinder piece and the rest of the body are separated. And the two side doors that spring out to hold up the hood when looking at rear LCD are flimsy. One of the side pieces broke at the base after only a few uses (and I'm not rough on my camera equipment). Hoodman needs to provide method to attach to the bottom, even if its some sort of adhesive. I suppose it would be nice if camera makers added some feature to allow for installion of this type of thing, but if they did, it would be proprietary they would charge 3x the price of Hoodman."
5,Identical to Image,It is white and looks identical to image. I liked how it arrived right away and it looks as I expected. I guess it's a great product if your looking for a combination wallplate with a switch and an outlet on the side.
3,Very lightweight and flexes too much,"If your surface isn't perfectly aligned with the front of the box and the receptacles/switch, the screws will tend to pull in and flex the plate. This is very flimsy and not the hard and stiff nylon ones I've used in the past. I'll probably replace it once I find a nicer one in a store."
5,Stephanie - Great CD for all types of music lovers!,"This New World Opera CD is fantastic ... I loved it! I am not really an opera fan so I wasn't sure what to expect when I received this CD as a gift but I really liked it. The lead singer, Stephanie Lien, has an incredibly beautiful voice which is both strong and versitile. The music is wonderful and inspiring. I plan to give this CD as a gift to each of my friends this year.I would recommend this CD to any music lover. The New World Opera is one of those CDs you'll want to listen to over and over again."
1,"Please take a beginner's science course, Dixy","What can you say about someone with the audacity to write a book about the environment when she clearly doesn't understand the difference between a natural water soluble chlorine bond (from volcanoes) and a man-made non water soluble chlorine bond (CFC). The former gets washed out of the atmosphere by rain, the latter makes it up to the ozone layer to disrupt the ozone molecule. Go back to high school chem, poseur."
1,"The book is all lies, don't read it please","I am a hampton fire firefighter and this book is all lies. Please do not buy this book because it is all lies. If you must buy this book, please email me and i will copy the book at copy mart and mail it to you free of charge. I don't want this liar making any money at the disgrace of our name. I can assure you any racial attitudes we have are left at the fire station. We are all only human and at times may have made racial slurs, but only in the fire station. never have we ever let our racial beliefs effect the good care we give on the street."
1,One star is too much,"Horrible book, full of lies by a obviously unbalanced individual. You would think with all the departments investigating his claims, they would have found something!"
1,"This book, like the author, is full of lies and deceit.","I feel that you have carried a grudge with you when you were fired from the Hampton Fire Department, and it shows in your book. I would request that you get the story correct before you use my name, or any incidences which involved me. You have printed unfactual information. Steve Hensley"
1,Yuuuuuck!!!,"In recent years, I thought I had seen some ludicrous material written by blacks who blame everything that happens to them on racism, but this one takes the cake. This book gives the word ""garbage"" a whole new meaning."
3,Hear him shine.,"This Australia single is very similar to the US single and ""Today"" ep. A remix of ""Today"" that's almost identical to the original, ""Put Your Lights On"" with Santana is a great bonus, a live ""What It's Like"", a live ""Jump Around"" that's almost unrecognizable, ""Blues For X-mas"" sounds like Tom Waits, and a Neil Young cover. Overall it's nothing to search the world for, but something to grab out of the used bin if you see it."
4,A Very Good Concise Study,"This book was a very good concise study of the world religions. I found the contents to be fairly objective, although the final section on Christianity was somewhat favored by the author as it is admittedly her own faith. However, I felt she created a good exterior view of these religions as well as provided some wonderful insight into their customs and dogma. I found it very interesting to study, and by comparison with other texts on the various religions, to be fairly accurate."
5,An amazing smooth clear voice~ a breath of fresh air,"It is amazing that someone as talented as Mandy Barnett has gone basically without notice for many years. I saw her on Larry's Home Diner this last week,one of the country music tv stations and was immediately drawn to her singing. She has been compared to Patsy Cline, and I would agree her voice a smooth comforting sound that I feel is better than that of Pastys. I have already purchased ""Legends"" and look forward to her next cd, and seeing her in the future and would love if those folks in Nashville would take more notice of her voice. She is a star! and I would love to see her make it to the really big stage. She deserves it."
5,She should be a star,It's amazing that someone as talented as Mandy Barnett could go basically without notice for many years. I saw her video on one of the country music tv stations and was immediately drawn to her singing. She has been compared to Patsy Cline but I think she has a more comforting sound than that of the legend.
5,Great collection from a terrific vocalist,"This is the best of the first two albums from Ms. Barnett. Only thing missing is a track she did for the soundtrack of the Reese Witherspoon movie, ""Election"", the song called ""If You'll Be the Teacher"", well worth seeking out to complete your Mandy collection."
2,For Ph.D.s only,"What a great concept for a book! I bought this book on the title alone to read Mr. Klein's thoughts on this very intruiging concept. Unfortunately, what I bought was a Ph.D. thesis written for Ph.D.s and graduate students preparing to become Ph.D.s. Required reading for every manager and executive? I think not - not until it's translated into English."
1,Michael Tsarion has proved he's from outer space,"Atlantis is either pure myth or, evidence that Plato had contact with Old Testament documents regarding the Flood story. In either case, his ""research"" is nothing more than speculation. Speculation is not research, no matter how you cut it. Stacking bricks on top of bricks and making wall paintings with primative hair dyes on walls represents alein technology? That is all that is required for aliens to travel from one planet to another? Nasa had better throw in the towel and let that hippy who lives on 5th Avenue, who makes clay pots, advise them on their next moon mission."
4,Good and a half,"If you were in one of the 1960's greatest psych/prog bands, what do you do in 1985?If Gary Booker, the same sound on different instruments. Most of the tracks here have the same type of chord structure that you would hear on most Procal Harum albums. But this was 1985, 1969, and synthesizers and booming production was the order of the dayWhich does not make as big an impact as you may think. The tracks royal feel actually allows the big 1980's sounds to contribute, not detract from their performance. Harum alwaus had a grand sound, and the big synths and big drums, while absolutely 1980a, actually work in creating this nuance. Booker's voice as soulful and powerful as when it made Harum one of the 1960s best band, and his vocal strength is mixed well here.'There is modern and their is vapidly slick, and, perhaps surprisingly, Booker walks on the modern side with no danger of ever crossing the line"
4,wonderful if familiar w/stats + new to sem,"This book is a wonderful guide to understanding a good range of basics about sem, getting models to work with Amos, and interpreting your output. You will need to be familiar with one of the stats packages that Amos is compatible with. Very much user-friendly in this complicated topic. All of the statistically-related and theory-related aspects are well-referenced, so you can find sources to reference for different aspects of sem. A great book to fill the gap between the Amos user's manual and books on sem in general. (contact Erlbaum about educ pricng.)"
3,"SEm amos (4,0) still relevant","This book introduces with examples the structural equation modeling, The book referrs to Amos 4,0 but the issues are almost same with amos 19. good book when learning to make modeling."
2,Good but?,The printed output analysis may prove helpful - if I ever get that far.After struggling for most of a day attempting to display output path weights I began searching the Internet for helps and how to's.A CD that contained sample data for the printed examples would have been very much appreciated.
5,The best investment for your 8800 card,"Installed it on eVga 8800 GTX superclocked card and the temps just went down like crazy !we're taking 20 degrees when compared to stock cooling which gave me enough room to overclock my card to extreme levels without any problems ( i am already exceediing the highest rated GPU , Memory clocks of the fastest 8800 cards available on the market; ULTRA, KO ...etc )Full load temps with GPU OC get to 65 - 72 degrees Max! now that's amazing with air cooling.Hint : i've installed a 13cm Thermaltake fan on this heatsink using normal wire straps , rather than the recomended 90mm fan and the stock fan bracket :)"
4,Nice book!,"It's a nice book, totally a steal at the $3.93 Kindle price I paid for it.It's not a book to learn from about the ""technical details"" of songwriting (e.g. different kinds of rhymes, common meter, etc), but rather a book on how to develop an idea into a love song.Loved the chapters where the author walks the readers through the process of writing the first draft of a song, then making changes to it, etc."
1,An absolutely worthless book,"I hate to belittle an obviously successful songwriter (although I've never heard of any of the songs listed on her website--and I know A LOT of songs), but the examples in the book are awful! Either she wrote the examples in the time it took to punch the keys on the keyboard or the book was designed for songwriters who have no desire of hearing their songs on the radio. Some of the songs, like ""Kismet,"" are so bad/old-fashioned/non-universal that I laughed when I read the words. I'm not saying that I could write better songs than she could (at least not now), but based on all the good things I read on the back flap in the bookstore, I expected a lot more than this. If you're looking to write lyrics period, this book might be acceptable for you. But if you want to write songs for radio, I highly recommend ""6 Steps To Songwriting Success"" by Jason Blume instead!!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Catseye is another book based in and around the Dipple slum settlement/camp, or whatever you want to call it. There are only a few options open to those that live here. In Judgement on Janus, the main character there chose one, the young man in this book chooses another, taking temporary jobs to try and get by.He lands what is basically a pet shop job dealing with exotic animals, who turn out to be far more than they seem. This leads to a dog and his boy sort of escapades, or the other way around."
1,Lucio's One Mistake,I'm sorry to say I can't recommend this album. Due Mondi is the only piece in it that is good and it can be found in other collections of his work.
4,Great Wallies,Nice wallies! Only problem I had was in the fact my walls have the orange peel texture on them and they did not adhear without extra wallpaper paste. The look great but keep that in mind.
4,Smooth Mints,"These mints have 15mg of caffeine per mint and 75 mints per tin. You can easily get the right amount you need without having to gulp sour energy drinks. You are also very kissable after using them. The only thing that kinda sucks is when you are sucking on them and you get a bitter taste in your mouth because the caffeine wasn't processed well enough and you get bitter little bits in your mouth. However, if you chew them up, you aren't going to experience that. They are amount the smoothest mints you can buy."
3,Warning! Does NOT include both bonus tracks,"Bought this because of the bonus tracks. It was suppose to have 2, it only had one, Badlands.It did not include the b-side track that I bought the CD for, Chasing The Chop w/ Eric Clapton.This could have been avoided if Amazon had put the track list in the description."
3,scary sound...kind of spooky...it's not for me,I know that the sound of his CDs are really healing and transforming and I own 4 of his cds. this one is my least favorite. I purchased it because I liked the title however this cd sounds kind of spooky and it doesn't give me the feeling of relaxation which I was expecting to recieve. It's more like just chanting and repeating mantra than music. It is not soothing at all when I play as a background music. There's no melody in this cd. My favorite of his cd is by far the waves of light! I listen to it all the time.
5,Amazing,"I absolutely love this CD. My favorite songs on the album are Little Razorblade, Modern Swinger, and Teenage Graffitti. The sound produced by this band is unique and yet addictive, and it flows easily. It's very pop-ish, and upbeat, while at the same time the lyrcis are interesting and provocative. The beats are great in almost every song. I would definitely reccomend it."
4,You won't like this review...,"Have you ever wondered what ""The Hives"" would sound like if:They were a 3-piece?Wore pink?Weren't as good?The ""Pink Spiders"" would be your answer.Honestly, the above album is worth picking up, it's the lesser of two evils when compared to other modern power pop groups like ""Click 5"". Yes, these guys are a bit too ""MTV-ified slick"", sure they're trying way too hard to seem cool, but at least their songs are about 75% catchy.I would now like to use this space to promote the ""Baby Shakes"", not because their music is good (it is), but because they're hot, I'm shallow, and that one guitarist plays a Rickenbacker...IN TORN FISHNET STOCKINGS!How can you not love that?"
2,Not a horrible introductory CD...,"However, only 1 track is worthy of consideration from music fans wanting something other than banal howls: 'Little Razor Blade'. With that said, LRB is a phenemonal song.To be more then a footnote in music history as ""yet another 1 hit wonder"", Pink Spiders need to up their game."
5,Chow Yun-Fat Collection,"The versitallity of the actor is stupendous! Many foreign pictures have much to be desired, but this collection proves that much improvement has been made in the movie industry in the past few years. Definately a collection worth purchasing. If you want a combination of action, suspence, romance, or all of the above, you will definately find it here. These are far from boring. All thumbs up from here!"
4,Another attempt at posting this review.,"John Kovalic, Heart of Dorkness (Dork Storm Press, 2002)I've heard a lot of great things about Dork Tower over the years, but as my Dragon subscription expired many, many years ago, I'd never gotten a chance to see it. My library did have one copy (across the whole system!) of one book, so once I knew that, I grabbed it. It's quite funny stuff, as long as Kovalic sticks to skewering, parodying, and otherwise mangling modern geek culture, and the overall storyline is a good bit of fun, but when the book gets serious, it bogs way, way down. Thankfully, that only happens a bit, and hopefully it's absent from the other volumes, which I must now hunt down via Interlibrary Loan (for the higher-ups at my library have no grasp of the term ""continuity""). ****"
5,Great stuff!,"This triple CD is fantastic... it really gives you the chance to hear how his band started out and how his popular sound was influenced by these pioneers. Trumpeter Bubber Miley simply wails on the wah-wah vibe and it's very cool to hear Duke's band with a tuba! The liner notes are key in how they describe the evolution of the band with each track. Raw, ripping jazz recommended to all jazz fans, and absolutely essential for Ellington fans."
1,Terrible crackle and surface noise!,"This CD set is particularly disappointing. The music contained on these CD's is essential Ellington, however, the the surface noice (crackle, hiss, pops) is so horrible that this set is unlistenable.Hopefully this important music will be re-mastered and properly re-issued without all the noise. I simply cannot listen to it this way. For now, opt for the OKeh set, which is contains an equally important collection of Ellingtonia, and is nicely transferred to CD."
3,Wacky Wigglers,Product delivered in a timely manner. The product was made for younger child than 6 though. It does not move very well without some of the pieces falling apart.
4,great fun,My kindergartener received this toy for Christmas. He was excited about the idea of building a robot and he had the pieces out of the box before the end of the day. The instructions are not too difficult to follow. There are large pictures. My son was able to put it together mostly on his own. Just watch out for which for how the pieces are oriented. My son got several on in the right place but turned slightly around in the wrong directions. He took about an hour to put it together with some help here and there. He felt very accomplished when he finished. Overall it is a fun toy that moves in a fun silly way.
1,Do not buy unless you want to burn your house down!!!,"When the battery pack got so hot that it started to melt, I returned the toy for a replacement. I got the replacement and put in 3 new name-brand batteries and the same thing happened again just second time we used it. My son noticed that the battery pack was getting hot, so I opened it up and nearly burnt my hand on the batteries. The batteries were bubbling and the plastic outer covering was melted. Keep in mind this is a brand new item after I returned the first one for the same problem. DO NOT BUY! If you do, make sure you take out the batteries after every use or you may find your house on fire!"
2,Learning Resources Gears! Gears! Gears! Wacky Wigglers,"Dad had to assemble this toy, it is fragile, but our 4-year old was fascinated with it. When It came apart, he was frustrated. Better for an 8-year old, at least. It is quite cute. It has about 6 lights that are part of the assembly, but 4 of them were ""burned out""--too dim to see. The others were very bright. A pricey toy to have come with burned out lights!"
3,"Good concept, but has some issues for younger children","I got this for my budding-engineer 6-year-old and it was a big hit. But when we tried to put one of the recommended projects together, several problems cropped up.First, some of the parts require a LOT of hand strength to assemble and disassemble.Second, there is a design flaw with a connector piece that requires a pin to be inserted into it. This pin tends to come loose, which means the gears that are spinning on it lose their contact with the contiguous gears, and the whole thing comes to a grinding halt - literally.But, if you just build some basic shapes and then let the kids' imagination take over, it's a much more successful toy. It will encourage creative thinking and problem solving. After the initial disappointment, my son is really enjoying it."
1,Did not work,"We ordered this for Christmas, but the motor did not work. The toy without the motor is useless. Companies need to have better quality control."
4,This toy is really fun!!,My children recieved this toy for Christmas. We have had fun putting it together and it is hours of entertainment. This toy is great for kids 5 and older. That is because the pieces have a tendency to come apart easily. The motor allows you to move the parts forward and backward. I also liked that the book came with different designs to build.
5,LOTS of fun,"My son got this at age 7. LOTS of fun! My 22yr old had a blast with it too. Smaller kids will need help building the different figures, but it's a great shared experience. Comes with instructions to make a few, but make up your own also. This set comes with some glow in the dark and light up pieces, which adds more fun when the lights go out."
3,fun and challenging with problems,"I worked w/my 6 yr. old grandson. He was very enthusiastic. The battery pack didn't hold the batteries firmly causing problems that he couldn't solve, and the cord was problematic often getting tied up in the gears. The tightness of the connections was a problem both in construction and disassembly. Spring parts weak. Uniqueness and wackyness pluses."
1,Frustrating!,"This toy has real potential to be fun and educational. My 7 year old son was excited to open it for Christmas; however, it is super frustrating. We followed the directions exactly and the gears keep jamming and so the creations won't work properly. It's no fun to spend time building something that won't work and just leaves your child frustrated and upset. I wouldn't recommend this set."
2,Not worth the price,I bought this as a gift for a family member. She didn't it find it to work at all. I was wondering why it had been reduced so much in price. She sent it back. I don't think it's worth anyone's time to buy it then send it right back.
1,Pieces breaking off after about a year of light use.,"I loved this until the plastic pieces started breaking off. The plastic screw caps on the top broke off after about a year of light use (2-3x a week for 15 mins). When the screw caps broke off, the whole plate lifted and vibrated noisily and exposed the electronics underneath. It seemed too dangerous to use after that and had to be discarded. Needless to say I am disappointed with the quality."
3,Shiatsu - Reflxology Foot Massager,"This foot massager does not perform near as well as another brand I purchased from Amazon for my Son. I returned this unit.For the price of this brand, the other I purchased for my Son being the same price, the difference is night and day. This one was a Xmas gift for my Hubby."
3,An enjoyable-enough read,"I came across BOOK in a used book and it sounded interesting enough -- which is more than I can say for virtually anything published in the conservative and intellectually uninspired Zeitgeist(s) of today's world. Feeling guilty over not supporting a relatively unknown author (by not contributing to the copies sold total), I promised myself to come here and write a review if I liked the book. Well, I'm here, although just barely. I enjoyed BOOK's farraginity of forms, its humor, and its plot (at least until its weak build to a weaker climax); but, in all honesty, I have to say that I wish Grudin had done more with structure than simply play around. Overall, I'd say it wasn't what I was hoping for based upon my first glance, but I did enjoy the read -- enough to have written this, at least."
4,a different sort of book,"I came across a hardcover copy at the campus book store, it was only $2 (brand new) so I got it but didn't get around to reading it for another year. I'm glad I picked it up. It was definately different from other books I've read. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a book that strays from the norm."
5,Absolutely Friggin Genius,"One of the best books I've ever read. Brilliant. Funny. Ironic. Both serious and funny, genre and parody, surreal and genuine. I just finished reading it for the second time.(Gotta love those rebellious footnotes!)"
5,Review: a review,"Presents on the surface as a murder mystery/thriller, but that is so not the point. The point is the most wonderful satire of literary theory since ThePooh Perplex, and of academic politics since, well, forever. Grudin has great fun playing around with language, couching different chapters in different voices (first, second, third), genres (narrative, nonfiction, drama, Q & A, etc.), marginal notes and footnotes (the footnotes attempt a takeover in Chapter 9, but are brutally suppressed--the marginalia tried to give warning!). I was going to ding Grudin a point for giving the novel Sovrana Sostrata a PR classification instead of a PS, but I take it back for the all-too-plausible postal abbrev for his fictional state of Washagon."
4,my review,"I thought this book was a really good book. It had a few crazy scenes and ideas in it, but that is what kept my interest. It explained family situations, some of which a lot of people could probably relate to in a smaller degree. I believe this novel deserves four stars for creativity in expressing its theme and main ideas. The book may have seemed a little extreme but that is how the main idea of it was expressed and it definitely kept the reader's attention on the novel. All the different characters and the jumping around style of writing was a little diffucult to follow and keep track of, but overall it was a really good book."
4,NEED A FAMILY TREE FOR THIS BOOK!,"If anyone has a family tree for the characters in this book, please let me know ASAP! My college class is reading the book and we are all confused with the family tree, including the professor."
4,Reality Shock,"Sometimes I will find that I live my life expecting everyone elses to be comparable to mine. Love Medicine proves that the way I live my life is not the only way to live, even in the U.S.. The book deals with the a community of Native Americans and their culture, and hardships dealing with the American government and each other. They live the life they have been handed living on reservations and doing what they can. They seem to find the reservation, or should I say the people on it, as family even though many of the characters are not blood, and that is where they draw their strength pulling back from the world around them."
3,Love Medicine?,"I thought the novel Love Medicine wa difficult to understand. It had a lot in the bood that did not need to be included in the book. It does show a good example of family bonding and the way other's make use of their time. But i feel that you have to be open- minded to understand and enjoy the novel. It explains a lot about another culture and their beliefs. It was an underlining theme in my opinion. The author describes their relationships and makes them seem like they are very disfunctional, but when you analize the book , you see that the family is doing good. Due to the circumstances they live under, they struggle and still stay together as a family."
4,A Great Book to Learn About Native Americans,"Love Medicine by Louise Erdrich is part of a tetraology. These four books focus on four different charaters. This particular book focuses on a character named June who is absent throughout the book. ""Homing In"" is a huge theme that a lot of Native American authors write about and it is evident throught this book. Love Medicine also shows the struggles of anger, desire, and the healing power of two families. Love Medicine is an excellent way to find out how Native Americans live on the reservation."
3,love medicine,"This book was not a book that I would normally want to read, but because of the emphasis our Englush class had on families,it became somewhat interesting. It was interesting to learn about another culture (Native American) and how their different values and beliefs effected their family lifestyle. Overall, the book was somewhat informative and unique in style and organization."
2,"""Love"" Placebo Curses Very Little","Love Medicine is the kind of book you read very slowly and very often to comprehend. It was one of the most confusing books I have read. It never really caught my interest. There were too many characters to deal with that water downed the story to the point where I did not really care about any of them. Maybe if I pick up the book again, I'd appreciate it more. In the meantime, two stars."
3,love medicine,"After reading Love Medicine the first thing that comes to my mind is totally confused. I honestly lost track of all the children and their parents. The reason I give this book a three however, is because I thought it gave good examples of the realistic hardships encountered by the Native Americans. Espcially the fact that most books tend to give us plots based on just the general societal condition. This story gave us an inside look into the effect of the reservation life on the families. I think I may want to try to read this again just to try and figure out the family tree."
3,Beloved,"Beloved is quite a story. First of all the whole issue with the ghostly daughter was really different and something one needs to adjust to. I think this book was a good read and I would recommend it. But there were some points in the book that confused me a little bit. I really think that the way this family was is displayed well. I don't think this was my favorite book though. I actually thought this was going to be the best book to read this quarter, but after reading it I would say that Joy Luck Club was my most favorite out of the three assigned novels of this quarter."
3,Journal #8,"I gave Love Medicine 3 stars because, although it was an interesting book at some points, many parts of the book were not too appealing to me. At times, reading it made me a bit uncomfortable just because it had quite a few sexual parts in it. Also, the language was vulgar.However, i think that the novel itself was well written. It was iteresting in the sense that it gave me a background about the indians and it also provided a different perspective for me to look at it.As for recommending this book... i dont think that i would recommend it. Also, the many characters are confusing especially because they seem like they are all related somehow."
4,If you love sagas...,"What i liked best about _Love Medicine_ was the way the characters were portrayed: so very real. Other authors, when dealing with Native American culture, fall short on their attempts to integrate their characters' spirituality with daily life in a believable manner.Some advice: I read _The Beet Queen_ first, and i liked it better that way."
1,Totally confusing!!!,"This is required reading for class and I am so confused. If anyone has anything that may help me, i.e. a family tree, suggestions, explanations etc. Please send them to me. Thanks."
1,"Well, I'd rather stuff my hand down my throat","Well this book was just terrible. I found myself skipping over entire chapter (it was required reading for school). How complicated and uninteresting can these peoples lives possiblely be. Sorry, but i do not care the entircate details of their pathetic boring lives. I'd rather walk on glass than read the second half of the book."
4,Love Medicine- Defining a Hardship in History,"Love Medicine defines a hard period in life for Native American Indians living on reservations located in North Dakota. The book expresses how outside environment variables such as alcohol and segregation from the U.S Goverment play a big role in the character's lives. Louise Erdrich writes a novel about multiple individuals in a family throughout the 1930's to the 1980's struggling to accept and understand each other. No matter how many problems they are confronted with, they have a strong bond allowing them to stay unified. The characters are able to have this link because they only have themselves to depend on."
3,"For book clubs who would rather eat, than read","It's best to maintain a list of characters when reading to keep from flipping back through the pages to determine who beget whom. The ironic humor kept me interested in the book. Unfortunately, there were a number of potentially great themes that were never developed. I recommend the much more imaginative and shorter (about 65 pages) teenage book, ""Weetzie Bat"",for those interested in the power of love and seeemingly disfunctional families."
2,interesting but pointless in many ways,I thought that this book was confusing. There were too many characters and too much going on. I found it to be interesting at some parts but VERY hard to follow. When I was done I did not come away feeling clear about what Erdrich was really trying to accomplish here.
2,"""Love Medicine""","While this novel engrosses you in the life of a somewhat disfunctional indian family, I never really got into the novel. The one positive side is the characters are fairly deep and their are quite a couple intelligent revalations about family. Besides that, the book is a snooze. The stories the author tells are way to drawn out. I never got into the novel, I always felt like I was just reading it. The author never really got me into the indian atmosphere either. The relationships in the book are also not very interesting. If you are looking for a book with family and interesting characters, read The Joy Luck Club, it's better."
1,"Very confusing, too many flashbacks, etc.","I absolutely hated this book. There were too many flashbacks. I had to read it for school, and I hated it."
2,LOVE MEDICINE Journal#8,"This was not that good of a story cause at times it sounded crazy and confusing. But one good thing about it was that the Indian family was very close to one another. The individuals in it cared alot for one another and during rough times they all came together. I would not want to read this book again because it is just not worth it. I believe there are alot of better books than this out there. Everyone is entitled to his/her own decisions and opinions but I do not think this was the book for me, maybe it would be for someone else."
5,Great Book for Traveling Dad's,"This book was purchased for my daughter, who missed her father terribly while he was away on business. It has passed to our second daughter who enjoys it just as much! I recommend this for bedtime reading to smile about the fun things a child does with their daddy."
4,an interestingly good book.,"I liked out of the dust, and recommend it, but it was depressing. People kept dying, and everything fell apart. It was about a young girl named Billie Jo, whose life, after her mother and brother die, drastically changes. It was very informative about the dust bowl, and it is a good story."
3,"Well written and always made me thirsty, but bad ending",This book was very well written. I liked how it made me thirsty every time i was done reading it. To me that meant that the book really explained the dryness of the dust bowl. Also i liked how the drama was always going up and down. The dissapointment was when it ended and it was still in a sad and gloomy mood. This dissapointed me because i was hoping for a good (but not extrodinarily happy) ending.
4,book,I was a good book in which exposed you to the harsh reality of the dust how often people died and how hard it was to keep on to hope even through severe hardships. I give it a 4 out of 5
3,Out of the Dust,"The book Out of the Dust had a great story line that always kept you coming back to the book. I didn't like however, that the author put in these characters and told you some of what happened to them but not the whole thing.For example when Mad dog sang on the radio they never said if he became famous or if he just ended up livin there.I did though really like the way she put in so much detail without making it stand out. Karen Hesse used poetry in just the right way to keep you interested but not bored. Overall this was a great book and i would definately read it again."
3,Pretty Good Book,"In the book Out of the Dust, there is happiness and sadness. During the book Billie Joe learns about courage, truth, and sorrow. When her mother passes away, it takes sometime, but she and her father developed a closer father daughter relationship. I liked this book because life is like this in alot of ways, and is really great for fast reading. I recommend this book to 11 year olds and up."
5,Out of the Dust Review,"Karen Hesse's poetic writing presents a complex character that has matured beyond her age and envelopes the reader from the very beginning. Because the novel is written using poetry, it allows the reader to move quickly through the story. This does not however, compromise the figurative language, symbolism, and themes present throughout. Details of the story appear to be authentic, but no author's note or afterword is provided to describe what has been fictionalized. Character and setting are well developed and facilitate the movement of the story. The story is strong and inspiring. It could be used in many facets within the classroom including research of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, exploring the relationships within families, and defining the meaning of ""home."""
3,"An emotional book, great for young adults","Out of the Dust(fiction) is a self narrorated book by Billie Jo Kelby, a teenage girl in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl. The story has many unpredictable and suspensful events. For example, one day when Ma is cooking by the stove, Pa comes in and sets a pot of kerosene on the counter next to Ma, who proceeded to catch fire to the whole kitchen! Ma then went outside to yell for Pa and Billie Jo attempted to get rid of the flaming pot of kerosene and on accidently hurts ma. Good Book!!"
5,thumbs up,"I am a middle school student and I must admit that I loved this book. I loved it a lot because it was in a kid's perspective, not an adult's. I never actually heard of ""The Dust Bowl"" until this book. Every other book on the Dust Bowl that I came across was in an ADULTS point of view. I had to read ""Out of the Dust"" for school and I won't lie, i thought that would be just another boring/bad book like always. But it wasn't, i really liked it.. It seemed so real, and I could actually understand what Billie Jo was going through even thought i've never been in something so tragic. I had to give this book the review it disurved. The form it was in was so unique, nothing like any other. It was in a poem form but at the same time like a diary entry. I thought it was really stupied and pointless, but it actually helped me get what was going on in some strange way. I honesty do give this book 5 stars, mayjor thumbs up :)"
5,Keeping her spirit,"""Out of the Dust,"" written as a series of spare free-verse poems from the viewpoint of a Texas teenager during the 1930s, won the Newbery Award for 1998. My own reading of the book convinced me that the award was well-deserved.Billie Jo's poems span a period of years filled with difficult experiences: poverty, unemployment, her mother's death in an accident, her own maiming in the same accident, her trouble communicating with her father. Her life is certainly not easy, her path almost never smooth. Yet, the poems radiate such a hope, even a joy at times, that the book never becomes depressing.I think some of the images of this book will stick with me for a long time -- the family chewing their dust-laden milk, her mother's tent of pain, her father's smile at the dance, Billie Jo's first concert after recovering from her burns. Billie Jo is a survivor whose story is both thought-provoking and uplifting."
4,This is a beautiful book about a difficult and tragic time.,"Billie Jo's courage is her most endearing quality. Hesse's first person narrator lets us into her mind to see her fears, doubts and guilts. By overcoming these, Billie Jo proves not only that she has ""sauce"" but heart as well. I particularly enjoyed Hesse paralleling the hole Pa digs with the hole or empty spaces in his and Billie Jo's lives. This book intimately reflects this devestating and important period of American history."
4,How Sad from the Dusty Country!!!!,"I don't know how they could have survived the hard times like they did. I also thought the free verse was an interesting style, however, the jumping from subject to subject was somewhat discouraging."
3,"A story about a girl, her father, and their Dust!","I thought the story was strong, but the format, which was done in a poetic free-verse was a bit distracting. But, it did show the relationship between the girl and her father well."
3,Out of the Dust,This book is different from all the others. It is a story in a poem. It is about a girl named Billie Jo and she lives on a farm with her Ma and Pa in Oklahoma in 1934. There have been a lot of dust storms and very little to no rain; so Billy Jo and her family don't have much money and don't get many proper meals. Billie Jo loves to play the piano in concerts to earn some money for her hungry family. Then there is an accident that puts Billie Jo and her mother on the line. Will she ever be able to play piano again? Read this book to see what will happen and if Billie Jo and her family can get out of the dust alive!
3,Out of the dust review,"My opinion on the book is that it gives a good description on what really happened in the ""Dust Bowl."" It gave the reader ideas of how people went along with life in depressive years of the Dust Bowl"
4,Wanting Out,"Billie Jo always seemed as if she wanted to get out of the dust. She even tried running away to a dust free place. But she came back to her father and to the dust because as she said the dust made her who she is. I would recommend this book to just about anybody because it is easy to read and understand what Billie Jo is talking about in this book. That is why I gave this book four stars. The reason why Out of the Dust didn't get five stars is because I didn't really understand what Billie was trying to explain in the passage ""Migrants"". Otherwise I would say this book is very good."
3,Out of the dust,"The book ""Out of the Dust"" is a book about the Dust Bowl. The main character of the book is Billie Jo, a 12-year-old girl with great ambition for the piano. She faces hard times when her Oklahoma household was deprived of all their family's hard-earned wheat. This book is unique partly because it's all written in poetry form. Some of these poems are unclear, because some are only four words long. Even though, the book shows a lot of heart and expresses the feelings of people back in the hard times."
3,Out of The...........,The book Out of The Dust was OK. I felt that the plot was of this book was great. Karen Hesse filled this book with tons of simmiles that meant alot to the characters.(once you've analized them and realized what they mean. Although this book was the most boring book that I have ever read!
3,My point of View,"""I am awkward with him, and irritated, and I want to be alone but I am terrified of being alone"". This is a quote that I feel I can relate to in a way. My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is ""The Empty Spaces"". This book is appropriate for 13-15 year olds. Any younger than 13 won't understand most of these poems. I disliked this book, even though I have not read the whole thing. I thought it was too boring and I would not want to say ""Oh that was a good book"" when there was a discussion going on about it."
3,The Depressing Story,"""I couldn't tell her, Couldn't bring myself to say, Her apples were gone. I never had a chance. Ma died that day Giving birth to my brother.""(Hesse, 69) Out of the Dust is a sad, depressing, and disturbing novel. The whole book is written in poems that describe how Billie Jo learns the hardships of life through death, depression, and dust. This book is about the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Billie Jo and her family work day by day just to survive. This book is appropriate for teens. I found this book depressing because Karen Hesse describes death and suffering through poems in the book. Out of the Dust is a book that made me think about suffering, and how life in the Dust Bowl felt. I recommend this book only if you like sad books."
3,My Review,"This is a sad book, but good. It expresses experiences that a lot of people had felt. I was really sorry for Billie Joe. After I finished it It made me think of all my family members that have died."
2,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz........... BORING!!!!!,I read this book relly fast but not because i loved it but because I wanted to get it over with. Almost nothing exciting ever happens it's like life in boringsvill!!!!!!!!!! There are manny good books out there but I'd have to say this is most defintly not one of them!
3,Out Of The Dust,Out of the DustOut of the Dust was a book that I wouldn't recommend to other people. This book is about a girl that lives in the dust bowl and what she goes through. In the book there is very little writing about the actual dust storms and how they were. I thought that when I was going to read this book that there would be more descriptive events and how the dust bowl came about and it would be more historical and I would learn more than I already knew. I thought that the reading went very slowly and there was not enough action in this book. I give this book 3 out of 5 star because I think that people with a historical background of this event would take it more personally and possibly enjoy it. I also give this book 3 out of 5 stars because I liked that the stories was written in pomes and how all the pomes come together to form one big story.
1,Horrible Violent/Upsetting Event NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS,I can't comment on the portion beyond the very disturbing/violent incident...I'm an adult and was upset for months after reading it. This book is NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS.
1,Boring,"Frankly, I did not like this at all. I am surprised that so many people said that it was depressing and ""compelling"". I had to read this for school, and that was the only reason I finished at all. This book uses the same classic milksop storyline as do many. ""Oh Daddy, we're going to lose the farm. But I still love you."" I do give the author credit for her innovative way of writing the book, but at the same time it also made it worse. The way it was written lacked details in the more important things, like the whole scene where she runs away. I saw no real reason for her to leave, or return, except the author thought it would be interesting. Also at one part, she introduces a character by saying they died. I don't see how it pertains to the story at all."
2,I thought it was Ok!,From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read.
3,out of the dust,"OutOfTheDust I didn't love,but I liked.I liked how karen Hess blended diffrent feelings together.It's about a girl named bille joe that keeps hoping and dreaming that her life will get better.It doesen't.Her mom is pregnet with a boy.Her mom gets hurt and the baby dies in the moms stomach.The mom dies too.I liked the poem called ""The accident"".They live in Oaklohoma.There's a duststorm and they have to move out of town.Well I'll leave you to pick this book and read it.I recomend this book"
3,sad but great,"Enter Billyjoe's world of sadness as you read Out of the Dust.This story is about a fourteen year old girl living without her mother. Her mom dies along with her brother Franklin. Billyjoe is left to live with only her father.Even though she lives with her father, she is still basically alone, because her father does not even want her. He doesn't want her because when she was suppose to be a boy.The other difficult thing that happens to Billyjoe is that there are alot of dust storms in Oklahoma, and this makes life harder for her because she had sores on her hands from a karasene accident and the dust makes them sting.I don't know of very many authors that can write sad but fun stories. Also, this entire book is written in poetry. I think Karen Hesse did a super job writing this book.By Jenelle Fitch"
4,Out of the Dust,"It is in the 1930's and ferocious dust storms sweep away all topsoil leaving southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, eastern New Mexico and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma soil less. The Dust Bowl forced an exhausting drought onto the land, making farmers desperate for rain through out the harsh ten years it dragged on. Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust describes the brutal dust storms and the life of thirteen-year-old Billie Jo Kelby, a girl from the Oklahoma panhandle, in an exciting; captivating book that helps you learn about the Dust Bowl while still enjoying the excitement of a fictional storyline. In rating the book on a scale of one to ten, I would rate the book an eight because of the poetic form the book was written in and because of the interesting story line behind it all. Out of the Dust was an exciting book to read and an interesting link to the historical facts of the Dust Bowl."
3,Out of The Dust - A Poetry Novel,"For Billie Jo a fourteen-year-old living in the Oklahoma panhandle playing the piano is the only thing that comforts her. Her life is rough like a rock as even the short walks to school are dangerous because of the sudden and unsuspecting dust storms. Then to make matters worse her mother's life is abruptly put to a halt and Billie's hands are damaged so they can never play again. Without the comfort of her mother and music Billie wants to escape her town and her tragic life. But when she gets the chance to escape she learns about companionship, forgiveness and most of all family. Throughout this novel you feel Billie's emotions and thoughts. This novel by Karen Hesse is one that will thrill readers' will for years to come."
3,OUT OF THE DUST?,"the book was very interesting. karen hesse has a very beautiful way of describing Billi Jo and her love and hunger for the piano because the way she talked about the piano in her diary was the exact same way i think of it. It was also very sad,but when she ran away I didnt get that, the way she describes it. her dad never talks to her until her mom dies. that also remindes me about me and my dad. I dont think it ended well it was very boring the last page but it was still very good different amotions so I it 3 starz."
3,Out of the Dust by CCP,This is a book about a girl and her family in the Okalahoma Dust Bowl. First some dust storms happen and the dad is just concerned about his crops. Later Billie Jo (the girl) brunt her hands and her mom very sadly died and her little brother Franklin died. Billie Jo was a good piano player and with her hands burnt she couldn't play. Her and her dad don't talk much. Billie Jo runs away on a train and makes it to Arizona and when she is there she calls her dad. They understand each other later. At the very end of the book her dad starts to like this other girl. This is a good book but is hard to understand.
4,Out Of The Dust,Out of the dust was a book that i read in my language arts class. I found this book very interesting because it was writin in lots of short little free verse poems instead of being writin in prose. I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars because I thought that it was a pretty interesting book. I would recomend reading this book.
2,Out of the Dust,"""The women talked as they scrubbed death from our house.""(Hesse, 71) Out of the Dust is a sad depressing story about a young girl named Billie Jo, who has to face one of the worst times in American history. The Dust Bowl. Billie Jo has to face many obstacles. Having to live in a place where the dust never stops blowing. This book was pretty well written but extremely sad and depressing. So if you like well-written books but are extremely sad and depressing then this is the book for you."
3,Too much poetry,"I feel the book was well written for a person who likes poetry. If you don't , you probably won't enjoy the book. Every page is a different poem but in a story format. This book mostley pertains to young teens or mature 7 to 10 year olds. The book is about times during the great depression in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico. It tells the life of a girl who survives the dust storms and the famous Black Sunday(April 14, 1935)."
5,Out of the Dust,I read the book Out of the dust by karen hesse. I think that this book was very good because she always left you hanging and it is hard to put the book down. The backround of the book was about a 13 year old girl named Billy-jo~ ( the reason her name is Billy-jo is because her father wanted a baby boy but he got a girl so he named her with a who is a red headed skinny girl who has a hunger for playing the piano. There are many things that happen between he and her parents that are sad.)who was in the dust bowl. The format of this book is all poems of her exsperiences with life. I found this book to be a quick read.
5,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust is about a 14 year old girl who lives with her ma and pa. Her name is Billie Jo. She lives in the Panhandle of Oklahoma. Her ma gets pregnet. There was an accident. She has the baby, and it was a boy. A few hours later her ma died. Before Billie Jos ma died they named the baby Franklin. The baby died later on that night, so they buried baby Franklin with Billie Jos ma together. Billie Jos father went out drinking with the emergency money. Aftr that night, he decised to go to night school. The only reason he wants to go to night school is for the women. I gave this book 5 stars, because it teaches people about the Dust Bowl. I learned about the dust storms that happenedin the Panhandle. That should be enough. Go out and get the book and read about the dust storms yourself."
4,Out of the Dust,"The book Out of the Dust by Karen Hessee is about a twelve year old girl named Billie Jo, who is living during the Dustbowl. The book tells about the hard times Billie Jo and her family members go through in the Dustbowl. I would rate the book as an eight out of ten because it was very interesting and I learned many things about life during the Dustbowl from reading it."
1,Slightly disturbing,"""I heard the wind rise, and stumbled from my bed, downstairs, out the front door, into the yard. The night sky kept flashing, lightning danced down on its spindly legs"" (Hesse, 39) I like the poem "" Fields of Flashing Light"" because it is very descriptive and uses a good metaphor. Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, is a compelling, long narrative poem,gruesome which depicts the Dust Bowl in 1934. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel depressed and realize what he or she is thankful for. The poetry in the book was exceptional. I enjoyed the book a great deal. Some of the events were a little depressing though. The mother gets burned in a fire and suffers for a few weeks and then finally dies .The father and Billy Jo aren't too close. Billie Jo runs away in search of something, but doesn't find what she is looking for so she returns home. Overall this novel was mediocre. Some of the poems were a little graphic but it was still entertaining"
3,sad,"This is one of those books that you really have to love and hate at the same time. I love this book because it was so interesting but I disliked this book because it was so sad. Really sad. It's one of those books you wouldn't want to read if you were already having a bad day. Anyways I think that since it is such a good story you should probably read it anyways, but be prepared to be a little depressed in some parts."
2,None,"I really don't understand why people like this book. There is not very much plot, and as much as the great fans will hate me for saying this, the book isn't well written. Poems, okay. I get why people think the book is special, but it's not good.What's the point of the book? What is the solid underlining point? Is there any? Or is this just a book of letters, painted on in a completely random pattern?I give this book two stars because some of the poems would have been okay had they actually been that, poems. There is nothing outstanding about this book, save the fact that it is written in poems. There are several other books out there like that. I don't think a book that is special deserves to have the label, good. There is a difference."
3,Mass read for countywide discussion,"The city of El Dorado Kansas and Butler County, KS decided it would be a neat idea for the whole city/county to read this book at once and then have discussion groups about the book, so my wife brought home a copy and read it and asked me to read it.I am an avid reader so I whipped through it in one sitting. It is written at about a 4th or 5th grade level, above it says 9 to 12 but we read The Hobbit in 6th grade when I was a kid.""Out of the Dust"" was a good story and it did give the reader a sense of what it was like in Oklahoma during the dust bowl. It is written as a series of free verse poetry, that at first was a bit odd but it worked.It is a nice book but not for a serious reader, unless you have an hour or two to waste on a trip and don't want to haul around a large book.I would recommend it to Jr. High kids. It is a bit much for anyone younger than that to understand and it is not compelling enough for anyone older than that."
1,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was about a family with two parents and two kids who lived in a town that had dust storms all the time. There was a tragic fire in the home and the pregnant mother died while giving birth. Billie Joe, the daughter, witnessed this tragedy. My favorite poem is ""Not Too Much To Ask"" because this family has very little of anything and they (the mom) are still willing to give to others in need. I think this book should be read by the age group of 13 year olds and older. This group would have the ability to understand what is happening and appreciate it. One literary technique that is used in this story is imagery. The descriptions of the area make the reader feel as if it is a personal experience. The reader feels the dust in their mouths. I disliked this book because it did not hold my interest and it was boring."
3,Good but bad,"Out of the Dust is such a well writen book with good fellingsand detail. But I didn't like the issues that Billie Joe had to livewith. Such as her father who wanted her to be a boy, what happened to her mother and baby brother. The dust storm. So I guess I'll say that Karen Hesse really painted pictures in your head of the book and wrote it very well, but it's not my taste for book. Out of the Dust really is a good book and I see perfectly how it got that medal, but I didn't like the story that's all."
2,Out Of The Dust,"Out Of The Dust, December 9, 2002Reviewer:a 13 year old readerOut Of The Dust was a very interesting book. My favorite chapter was summer, because it was really important chapter. It the chapter where mom dies giving birth to Franklin.I think you should at least be 10 years old to read this book. There are a few big word and it sort of confusing. But it is a really god book for 10 and up.There is a lot of imagery in this book. One example of imagery is when she wake up and says there is a dust outline of her head. That gave me chills just thinking about it, ahhh.I gave it 2-5 stars because I am not a big poetry fan but it was an all right book. It had a good story line and lot of personalities."
2,Out of the Dust,I did not like this book because it was in poems and it dragged on and on. It was to easy like 8-10. It was a sad book because Billys mom died. It was about the dust bowl and it was borning again. Once in the story her mom died and her brother dead and not being able to play the piano. She got on a train and then her food got stolen then she got off. It was a SLOW book.
5,shannon gilliam,"we read this book in texas history.I liked it alot it had a pretty sad ending but it gave me a really good glimpes of what happend back then during the great deppresion it wasn't a easy time at all for them, and it seemed that they had alot of trouble with people dieing and them losing people that they loved very much the way that they did.When i looked at the cover i thought it was going to be the most boreing book but it wasnt thats why im glad that they have the qoute,""never judge a book by it's cover."""
4,Out of The Dust,This is a pretty good book but I don't like how it is written in free verse poetry. What I did like about the book is it gave lots of detail. And it was a very easy book to read. The book also had lots of dialogue. The only thing is the book was very long but the pages didn't have a lot of words on them so it kind of evened out. My friend said awhile ago that this was a good book. The reason I read this book is because we were reading it in English class. But I probably would have read it anyway.
5,A Really Great Book,"Out of the Dust has an interesting format. This book by Karen Hesse is written in free-verse. The main character, Billie Jo, has to live with repulsive problems such as dust everywhere she goes and that her only money source, the wheat, won't grow becuase of the dusty land. Just as her hopes were getting high they are smashed by her mother's gruesome death. Unfortunately, at the time of Billie Jo's mother's death she was pregnant and mournfully the baby died. A few months later Billie Jotries to run away from her problems and hops on a train. She then learns from a stranger that you can't run away from your problems. She then goes back to her father and he has skin cancer. Does he survive and live happily ever after with Billie Jo or does he die and leave Billie Jo all alone in the world with the piano as her only comfort? This exhilarating book keeps you on your toes until the very last word on the very last page."
2,Nic and Alex,"For the most part I got really bored easily. I mean come on you pretty much can predict what's going to happen next, more dust. Although I was grasped a little by the story line. You really have no idea that the girl was thatr miserable. I would recomened this book to a person who likes slightly boring books.PS, Hi Ms. Schultz and class!"
3,An Accurate Book,"Out of the dust is an incredibly accurate book baced in the great deprestion but, being baced in the grate depretion, the book is just plain depressing. I think the book ends sorta weired whare you can only asume that the father marrie's that one girl and thay live happily ever after but you have a fealing inside you that thay probly wont. even though it is verry sad and you often ask yourself why this had to hapen, to this family and familys across america the truth is that is did hapen and we cant change that."
4,it's a good story,"Recommendation-I recommend this book to anyone that's 13 years old and up because the first part of the story is emotional. Billy's mom died. ""Ma died that day giving birth to my brother."" Billy's mom died because of the fire in which she was burned badly. This is why I recommend this book to older kids. I like this book because when people that are close to you pass away it shows how you can get on with your live. ""I was invited to graduation, to play the piano."" This citation shows that people start to think that Billy is normal, and she can play the piano again."
3,Out of the Dust: Erica's Review,"The book I recently read was ""Out of the Dust"", by Karen Hesse. ""Out of the Dust"" is about a girl named Billie Jo and the hardships she and many others went through in the era known as the Dust Bowl. When dust storms sweep the wealthy wheat fields, including many of the wheat farmer's homes, people start moving out of the Dust Bowl. As the wheat whithers away, some farmers give up hope. Billie Jo's father continues to work out in the field in hopes of a decent wheat harvest, though his hopes are continually shattered. After Billie Jo's mother dies in an accident that involved Billie Jo, she soon gets the decision of leaving the dust for good, along with her father, or stay and face her problems. She decides to stay and face the hardships, together with her father."
5,Out Of The Dust Is The BBBBEEEESSSSTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The book was a true story and I almost thought it wasn't true because it was so sad.I really felt bad far the auther because of all the sand that was messing up her life. If I could ask the auther one question I would ask:""How could you live with no mom ,no brother sand always in the wrong place,and a father who didn't say much."" Anyone who wants to read it try to face the facts of true life. (But I have to say it was very good.)"
5,Great Book,This book is one of Ms.Hesse's best books. This newberry book will touch your heart. In the book 14 year-old Billy-Jo must face the horrid truth about death and at the same time live through these dust storms. This book is the very greatest!
4,Depressing.,"I find this novel being a quite bit too serious, slow, and depressing. It's about a girl, named Billie Jo that sadly lost her mother in a tragic accident. Billie Jo, having the town think it was all her doing, mostly caused the accident. After her death, the books slightly gets slower, being in the hassle of having a pretty bad relationship with her dad, and that makes the story even sadder.""I don't know my father anymore.He sits across from me,He looks like my father..."" (Hesse, 76)What I really like about the novel is that it's a blank verse book that makes it look attractive, but once I saw it for the first time I had said, ""Oh, it's just a short, boring looking book."" Not really, the story does emotionally touch you by the way it's written. Out of all books I have read, I'd say this book would be worth it for all readers ages 12 and up. Excellent job Karen Hesse!"
4,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust Review""I don't know my father anymore. He sits across from me, He looks like my father, He chews his food like my father, He brushes his dusty hair back Like my father, But he is a stranger."" (Hesse, 76)This is the first stanza to my favorite poem, "" The Empty Spaces."" In this poem the narrator, Billie Jo, explains how she and her father are gradually separating from each other because a terrible accident happened in their family. This amazing book written by Karen Hesse is a book of poems. It is about thirteen year old Billie Jo and her life during the Dust Bowl. Billie Jo has a powerful love for pianos and leaving the dust in Oklahoma. This marvelous book includes many examples of figurative language. My favorite simile is ""The wind roared like fire,"" which refers to the blustery winds during another horrid dust storm. All of these poems have great depth and meaning. I would recommend this book to ages 10-14."
2,THE BEST APPLE FROM RICH CITY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like this book becuz its sad and predictable at the same time the book is also depresing. Its depresing because thiers so much death and sarrow.Its like a soap but way more dramatic. but it was all good but it was kinda boring at the same time... well if u read it u well knw wht im talkin bout alright. well if u like this book u must be raelly boring and dull , because thats wht the book was,the only part that was good was the part wear she ran away other then that the book was so boring."
2,Its kinda BORING!!!! 4-real!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I didn't like it becuz it was boring and it wasnt interesting to me. I would recommend it to a person that likes boring books. I wouldnt recommend it becuz if u wanna read a good book its not ""Out of the Dust"" cuz like I said before its so freakin BORING... LOL but anywayz that is wht I think bout ""Out of the dust"" Well if u read it u well knw wht im talkin bout...LataP.B"
2,the dust dust dust,"I did not like this story. Because it dose not make sence. Because there was a pour family that had a kid named Billy Jo. She liked to play piano, so did her mom. Then her mom gotten burnt and she was prenet. The baby died when she was haven it. But thay named it Franklin after the president. Then Billy Jo go's to school and one of her teachers treats her like shes her daughter. Then she runs away and gets a train ticket and gets on a train. If she could buy a train ticket why couldnt thay all of them buy one and sell the house and move away. That is why I dont like this book. If u want to read this book go ahead."
1,Out of the Dust,"I've read some of Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse.This book is also about dust storms.Billys mom is gone and the poor things name is Billie Jo because he wanted a boy. The only thing Billie likes to do is play the piano but can't because her hands hurt,why I don't know[I havent read that much]."
4,BOOK REVIEW,"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING - BORING. I WAS IMPRESSED, CONSIDERING I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK FOR SCHOOL."
5,This book was cleverly and wonderfully written.,"Karen Hesse did an excellent job of expressing the character's emotions. She portrayed the feelings of death and happiness wonderfully. With characters such as Billy Jo and Bayard this had to be one of the best books I ever read. This book was exciting and breathtaking, kept you on your toes, and made you want to listen and read more. Karen Hesse turned what looked like an ordinary poetry book into a real life story of an everyday family's life. While reading this book we learned that your problems never get better if you run away and you can never give up even if life seems at its worst."
4,A wonderful book of courage and feelings!,When I first started reading this book I did not like it. I never thought about how the dustbowl affected peoples lives so much. It really is a touching book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historic books with flavor.
5,A quite adventure,"""As wheat came ripe so did I. Born on the kitchen floor Ma croched. Bare foot, bare bottemed over the swept boards because that is where daddy said it would be best.I came to fast for the docter bawling as soon as Daddy wiped his hand around in in my mouth. To hear Ma tell it. I hollard my self red the day I was born. Red is the color I've been ever since.Daddy named me Billie-Joe. He wanted a boy."" Billie-Joe born in the panhandle of Oaklahoma in the 1930's was in the quite adventure titled ""Out of the Dust."" Poor Billie-Joe! Her father was hoping for a boy but when ""long-legged"" Billie-Joe popped out you know he was dissapointed. Billie-Joe was a piano loving tomboy. She had spirit and courage. Maybe to much."
4,Definately Dusty!,"'Out of the Dust'was a very good book. It did catch me in a lot of places, and when it did, I never stopped reading it!The ending wasn't surprising, but sometimes that's what you need for a Best Seller."
2,Ok book,"I think that the novel Out of the Dust was an ok book. It is made of a series of poems writen by the main character Billy Jo. The author of this book is Karen Hesse. It takes place in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl. This novel is only 227 pages long and the peom set up makes it a very quick read. It was realy hard to distinguish between the rising action, climax, and falling action of this book though. So really you feel like something is going to happen but it never does. All the main character talks about is how dusty it is and how she wants to leave. The dust and wind is so bad that they can't grow the wheat they need to survive. The only real events that happen in the book are that the mother gets burned by Billy Jo and later dies giving birth to a baby that just dies, and Billy Jo finally runs away from her Father and the dust at the end but she just comes back."
3,Out of the Dust,"This book was very interesting and told a lot about life during the Dust Bowl. But everything about the fire incident was hideous, I really didn't like that part of the book at all. But it still gets 3 stars since the rest was good."
4,Very Sad :-(,"When I first read this book, I thought that it was really boring. But when I got into it, it was really interesting, but also sad. The saddest part was when Billie Jo started a fire and burnt her mother and herself. This is one of the best books I have ever read...."
1,Out of the Dust,"Billy Joe lives in Oklahoma.She accidentally burnt her mother by acccidentally throwing kerosine on her apron.Her mom was making breakfast before she caught on fire. I would rate this book A onebecause it was very very boring! the whole book was a poem.A boring poem in that case.so, listen to me and don't BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
4,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust was a book about 4 long year in the 30's when lots and lots of dust appeared. The Dust Bowl was in Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahama, and Colorado. The dust went in the food, beds, walkways, drinks, and everywhere else. Alot of people moved to California in the time period, but California got so filled up with people, that there was no more room for anyone else. Alot fo people died from, what they called, Dust Pneumonia. Dust Pneumonia went around until the Dust Bowl was over.Out of the Dust is a book that when you start it, you have to finish it. The book was also fun to read because it was easy to picture yourself int he characters postion."
4,bite the dust,Out of the dust was a very good fiction book. Even though it was fiction it told the true story behind the oklahoma dust ball. This book is AWESOME!!!
4,Dust Licker,Do you have your own Journal or Diary at home? If so than you know how interesting they can get! This book is made up of entries that a young girl has written in her diary during the Dust Bowl time period. Tis book is AWESOME!!! Written by: Donna Howell
3,The Story of the Dust Bowl,"Out of the Dust was a pretty good book. It was based on a period of time where there was a drought that lasted 8-10 years.Somethings that were good about the book were the metaphors. For example when Miss Freeland said ""Our future is blowing away with the dust."" What she meens by that is she thinks that they have no future. One of the weaker points of the book were it wasn't very exciting and it was hard to get into. I would reccomend this book for people around the age of fourteen because it was fairly easy to read and to understand."
4,Out Of The Dust?,This book is very well writen and easy to read for a younger audince too. I liked how the book is in a poem form so the pages arnt that long. This book describes the dust storm very well from a person prospective even though this was a fictonial character. The author did alot of research on this book to be soo descriptive. I gave it the four stars because it got a little boring. So in conclusin i would recomend this book to alot of people because it is very interesting.
3,Out of the Dust,The book had a great plot but some of the things Karen Hesse wrote left me thinking different things then it actually meant.I liked how she explained all the hard times that Billie Jo faced in a dairy form of writing.I wish though that she would have explained more on what happened to the characters that already left the dust bowl such as if Mad dog became famous or what happened to Billie Jo's best friend Livie.Overall this was a great book and i would definately read it again.
4,Out of the Dust,"I thought Out of the Dust was a very well written novel. It brings the reader inside the life of the main character, Billy Jo. Billy Jo goes through many changes and hard times throughout the novel. She must learn to adapt and become familar with changes in her life. The novel is very descriptive and makes it seem like the reader is right next to Billy Jo as she is walking through the dust storm trying to get home in time. Karen Hesse has a very unique way of writing this novel. Instead of the usual format for writing, Karen used poems to express the feelings of Billy Jo. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to other readers that are searching for a great book to read."
4,Out of the Dust,"I thought Out of the Dust was a very detailed and descriptive novel. It described the dust bowl with great detail. Billie Jo's thoughts that she put into her poems, gave you a feeling that you, as the reader, were really there. Her descriptions of the dust storms were very detailed, so it was easy to visualize what the dust storms were actually like. Billie Jo also described the everyday life in the dust bowl with great detail. This book gave a very detailed descripition of life in the dust bowl."
3,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust is a great story that has that rare flaver to it givin by the many discriptive words used throughout the book. The discriptions givin by Karren Hesse make you feel as though dust is raging around you in a a giant cinder elemental. The plot of the story is also great since it tells the reader of the many harsh times in the dust bowl in the 1930's. My only bad point about the book is that it is written entirely in poetic verse. Not being a big fan of poems myself, I often found it hard to follow the words, and ideas strewn about the pages. I would indeed recomend this book unless you detest poems."
4,Out of the Dust,"I thought Out of the Dust was a very detailed and descriptive novel. It described the dust bowl with great detail.

Her descriptions of the dust storms were very detailed, so it was easy to visualize what the dust storms were actually like. This book gave a very detailed descripition of life in the dust bowl."
3,Out of the Dust,The story starts out with Billie Jo living in a little Panhackle shack with her mom and her dad her mom is pregnant with her little brother. Billie Jo is a 13 year old that has checks like bycicle handles and a hunger for playing fierce piano and a fondness for apples. When an accident happens between Billie Jo and her family her life could be changed forever. Billie Jo's hands changed when they get burned and could totally change her life with her piano.
2,"Overall, a pretty good book","My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is ""Out of the Dust."" It starts off with her telling about how she knows that she is going to die if she stays. She decides to go and hitch a ride on a train. She goes west to get out of the dust. I like it because the book is named after it.I think that the book is appropriate for anyone who can read. People who like non-fiction books, or realistic fiction books would enjoy it. I think that older people might like it because they might be able to relate to it.The free-verse form in the book is an essential piece. It lets the author express what she wants to in a poem form. You don't see many books written this way, so that makes it unique. It also makes it easier to read, I think.Overall, I think that I would rate this book two stars. It is good, but personally I didn't like that much. It has lots of historic background, which I think is good to have in a book. If you give this book a chance, you might like it."
4,Out of the Dust Review,"Well, before I begin, I want to stay that the book Out of the Dust, is one of my favorite. It is one of my favorites because the plot, characters are awesome! The plot explains the life of a young girl by the name of Billie Jo. Billie Jo is a red haired, long legged, and cheekbones like bike handles type of girl. She lives the in Panhandle of Oklahoma with her Ma, and Daddy. In the beginning Ma is pregnant, and the family is happy. Then a terrible accident occurs, leaving Daddy and Billie Jo alone. Now Daddy and Billie Jo never have gotten along. Then through out the rest of the book, their relationship gets stronger, and stronger. This book is surely a classic. I praise Karen Hesse for her wonderful work.~Nicole Truskowski"
4,A Tale of the Dust Bowl,"This tale of the Dust Bowl, told through a young girl's diary, brings to life the bleak and dusty landscape of Oklahoma during the 1930's. Billie Jo's dreary life is brightened when she plays on her mother's beloved piano until a terrible accident takes her mother's life and leaves scars on Billie Jo's hands and her heart. For those studying the Depression, this story will bring to life the hardships of life in the Dust Bowl."
4,This was very good but soooooooooo.,sad. I actually read this one on my own only to realize we would be reading it later that year for school. It was written very well. Unlike many books in the sense that it was in journal form but written from the viewpoint of a young girl with bad things flying at her in every direction (metaphorically speaking of course...) but trying her hardest to see the light. I would reccommend this one for the expierence but let me warn you it is certainly a sad one.
2,Exaggeratingly Sad book,"The book is written in nice,figurative language, but it is far too sad. The book starts out like not such a bad story, but then suddenly it hits this spot with terrible sadness and frustration. Yet, it gives far too many details of how terribly some of the people in the story die. Basically what happens in this story in the sad part is when 2 people accidentally make dangerous, careless mistakes, which lead to the killing of 2 other people. When I got to that part, I felt like not reading this book anymore. I can't believe this book received about ten awards."
5,Out of the Dust =],This book is inspirering to me and it can be to many. It teaches you to never give up on your dreams. The young Billie Joe love piano and dispite her troubles she still finds a way to play. I would recommend this book to people of all age's. Read it I did. =]
4,The real dust,"In my opinion, this is an excellent book. It is very informational yet it keeps the reader interested. After reading this book, if you study the Dust Bowl and hear real interviews from real victims, you find that the book is so precise. There was no exageration, if anything it was lax on the trouble they went through. I think that every kid or teen old enough to understand this story should read it. It made me appreciate what I had even more. Just to think ""she was my age"" makes you sad. They went through so much and it played a big part in history. This book deserved the Newberry Medal!"
5,Not just for Children,"Though ""Out of the Dust"" is marketed at a YA selection, it is no more a children's book than ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" With a series of perfectly rhythmed prose poems that capture the sensations of the 1930s dust bowl, ""Out of the Dust"" tells the story of a young girl in Oklahoma who must overcome her own guilt when her mother is killed in a house fire. This is one of the most vivid, painful and, in the end, joyous stories I have ever had the great fortune to find."
3,Sad Book,"This book was very sad.It made me cry when the girl gets older she writes in her diary.Her mom and dad gave her the diary this book is about the 1920s,1930s,1940s,1950s.I told Mrs.McDonnel about the book.She said don't read it again"
4,Required Reading for school,My son was required to read this book for school. It was kind of depressing like everything they make them read. Was a first hand account of the dust bowl. I bought the e-version and the teacher made us buy the book. Not sure the difference. I would think they had rather adopt technology in the classroom. They are backward assed people teaching.
1,hard to rate a product you don't recieve,I realize this was years ago when I needed this book for a college course but I still have never received my book in the mail from this order.
1,Not Karen Heese Material,"I still can't believe Karen Heese wrote this. It's like a social studies book. I've tried to get through this book for I don't know how long but I still haven't finished it. I've read enough to know I don't like it and I would only recomend it to people who like the Laura Ingles Wilder books. It's very old fashioned and well, boring. The plot doesn't have a climax, a begging, or even really an end. It drags on way too long.If you wanna read a GOOD book by Karen Heese, then read ""Music of the Dolphins"". That is one of my absolute favorite books. That's why I can't believe she wrote ""Out of the Dust"". It is way different than Music of the Dolphins, and it didn't take place 100 years ago. Don't judge Music of the Dolphins from reading Out of the Dust, trust me. You wouldn't know they were by the same author if her name wasn't on the book."
3,out of the dust,This novel is about a young girl going through many struggles. First her dad left kerosense in the kitchen and then her mom and helself get burned. SHe loved to play the piano but now since the accident her hands are burnt. This book is really depressing because her mom dies along with her new baby brother. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to read emotional books. I give it three stars.
5,Excellent Book!,"I LOVED Out of the Dust! I used to live in Oklahoma, so it was a really great way to learn about what it was like living there during the dust bowl! I really love the way you feel like your reading a diary! This is an excellent book, I definatley recomend reading it! If you don't, your missing out on a chance to learn a part of American history that not too many people talk about!"
5,Wonderfully written!,"Billie Jo experienced many suspensful and surprising events during her life time! Sometimes it was very confusing and hard for her. For one thing she killed her mother, and she can't do much with her hands because of the kerosene. The dust storms they have are unbearable, and without her mother she is lonely! The ending of Out of the Dust is unbelieveable! I didn't expect Billie Jo's father to fall in love with another woman. Overall this book was great!!"
5,A wonderful read!,"Out of the Dust is written extremely creativly, through poetry. It tells all about the adventures and tragedies of a twelve year-old girl, living in Oklahoma in the Dust bowl. It has short chapters and even if you do not like reading this book is still for you. It kept my attention and it will certianly keep yours!"
2,Lynz's book review,"Out of the dust was a pretty boring book. It is about a girl named Billy Joe who overcomes a lot of obstacles like living in the Dust Bowl in the late 1920's. After a Freakish accident, left Billie Joe motherless, her baby brother dead, and not being able to play her beloved piano things went down hill.I would only recomend this book to a person who likes boring books that have no point. This book went on and on. It never went strait to the point. I don't like slow books and this book was very slow. It was quite sad and not very exciting."
2,Carly's book review,I read Out of the Dust. Personally I didn't like it. I thought it was boring and was uneventful. I rated the book with two stars. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was just about the girl and her life in a dust storm. It was written in poems and I thought it was very very boring. It was a girl who's mother died after the girl burned her accidentally. She also burns her hands and isn't able to play piano anymore. She decides to run away but then comes back. The book seemed to drag on and on and on. It was slow paced and it made me want to fall asleep. Everyone I talked to hated the book such as my friends and classmates. If anybody asked me a book they should not read I would say Out of the Dust. It was awful to have to read this book. I will never read this book again. I don't recommend it.
2,not what i thought,this book was a boring book. the cover was even boring. it is all about a family that started with 3 people but ended up with 2 because billiejo's mother had a baby but died right after and the baby died too. ths book is sad and all but it keeps on repeating the same thing over and over again. i have never read a book that is all poems that tell a story that reapeats everything at least twice. there is not much to say about this book because it wasn't all that exciting. all i can say is that i wouldn't tell one of my friends about this boring book. But im not the one that is stoping you from reading this book because everyone has a different opinion about everything so you could maybe try it if you like and see what you think of it and maybe you can write a review of your own.
3,Out of the Dust,"I didn't like Out of the Dust very much because it's mainly about people suffering; like when the mother got badly burned or when the father got skin cancer. Since the book takes place in The Dust Bowl, the setting is very dry and dusty, so the book makes me thirsty when I read it.Out of the Dust is written in a very strange way that I have never seen before; it is composed of many poems that tell the story, which makes it easy to read.Out of the Dust is about a teenage girl, Billy Jo, who lives in the Oklahoma panhandle in the Dust Bowl. She burns herself and her mother in a freak accident. The mother died along with Billy Jo's unborn baby brother. Billy Jo, unable to play the piano anymore because of her wounds, becomes very miserable.Want to know more? Why don't you go read the book?"
3,Out of the Dust,"I personally dislike historical fiction, but this book was okay. Out of the Dust made me feel like I was inside a dust storm, everything around me slowly dying away. The free verse is neat, but it got a little old after a while. The author ultimately did an good job of making a character up, and putting her in a real time, and I would recommend this book to people who aren't all about fantasy; like me."
5,A great book!!!!,"I really like Out of the Dust.I think it is a book for people who like to learn about different time periods,and journal type form. Although it is in poetry you forget about it! Read Out of the Dust as soon as you can or you will regret it!!!!!!"
5,WEIGHT OF THE DUST,"I'm writing about the book called Out of the Dust. In this book my favorite poem is Blame. This book is about the little girl in the book who blames her self for her Mothers death and also for her baby brother's death too. This book is recommended to you for the age group of 12- 65. This poem is written, in a way that she felt alone. The reason that I say this is because some of the words in the poem are written by their self. I really think that this is an excellent book and if you are ever in the library stop by the fiction section and check out Karen Hesse OUT OF THE DUST!"
5,Out of the Dust,I love the book Out of the Dust. It is about a girl namedBillie Jo and her life during the Dust Bowl. I give this book fivestars because you can really understand all of her problems. You feellike she is your best friend because the author describes her so very well. Billie Jo's life is hard because of the Dust Bowl. The book is easy to understand and I recommend it to anyone who likes adventures.
2,Out Of The Dust (what a joke!),"I dind't really like the book called Out Of The Dust it wasn't fast paced-paced or even exciting. The whole book was written like a poem. But some parts were emotional, and to others it might of even moved them,but I would give this book a 2. I recommend this book for people who are interested or even obsessed with dirt or dust. It all takes place in the Oklohoma Pan Handle."
4,A Good Read,This book was interesting to say the least. It takes place in the dust bowl durring the great depression. Billey Joe is the main chareter. She thinks her life is so pointless after her mom dies. finally she decides to run away. I will not tell you the end of the book but it is worth buying ...
4,Inspirational,"This is an inspirational story of Billie Joe's experiences of growing up during the Dust Bowl. This book gives an indepth peek into Billie Joe's life through her diary entries. Through out the book, she discusses the drought, problems at home, and her love for playing the piano.This is a good book to tie in with history courses. It gives a real life account that children can understand."
4,Nice to meet Billie Jo,"We really liked the book. It was nice to read, although it was a little long. It was interessting to ""meet Bilie Jo"" and to hear about her life, her family, her feelings and hopes.What we liked especially about the style of writing was the poetry, it was new for us, but we really enjoyed reading it.We can recommend this book , we think it is a good experience for everyone!"
5,One of the most emotional book I have ever read!!,"I just finished this book for the second time. When my 5th grade teacher read it every day it was hard not to feel the emotions Billy Joe was having. The book was awesome and I reccomend it to anyone,any age!"
3,The Big Apple from C-land,"I thought the book was okay, but I didn't understand it though. But if you have six-dollars go and spend your money on this book Out of the dust. Go and buy the book or else."
3,Out Of The Dust,"Karen Hesse' book ""Out of the Dust"" is a very touching book. Reading thru the book I sometimes felt like I could understand what she was going thru. The book is about a young girl named Billie Jo, who does not seem wanted by her Dad or Mom. When a terrible accident occurs she feels all alone, becuase her Dad can not talk about it. The one thing she loves to do she can't, becuase her hands are cracked and sore. Their crops are dying, her best friend just left, they get huge amounts of dust storms, which kill the livestock and the one person who she can talk to is gone. This is a good book to know what it was like in Oklahoma in the year 1934, but even though it is touching it can be kind of hard to follow."
3,Okay but needs more,"I liked this but it wasn't the best. I'm not saying it was stupid, but if your looking for a great read: don't get it."
3,What's all the hype?,"This is an ok book, but not deserving of all the stars it's getting. I like the style, but the story is thin, and the characters aren't very well developed. I never got attached to any of them. The author needed to provide more detail. It was just a story, nothing special."
2,I don't rate this book as high as many. I get tired of dust.,Being forced to read a book which uses the word dust at least 200 times forces me to submit a review that is not as pleasant as the general population's. I did not enjoy the book a great deal. I think that the plot needs more substance than the dust that swallows Billie-Jo's town. I found the book depressing and unneccessary to be read at school. It is alright if you don't mind that sort of thing.
1,This book really stinks!,"The theme of this book is death. You meet someone, you like them, they either die or move to California. Sorry I ruined all the book talks about. This is the kind of book that kids hate, and yet teachers think they love. It is really depressing when everyone dies."
1,Good book if you want to be depressed,"This book takes realistic fiction for children too far. Although it is well-written, it is very depressing. It gives the reader an interesting inside view of life in the dustbowl, and the narrator is a very interesting and likeable character, but her life goes from sad to tragic to VERY sad to EXTREMELY depressing to UNBEARABLY sad - and only near the very end is there a somewhat positive ending. The overall feeling that this book conveys is depression. More space should have been given to dealing with issues in a positive manner and, possibly,how to overcome obstacles - even if only small steps can be taken.Most kids can think of depressing situations - very few know how to resolve conflicts and overcome life's setbacks. This is the type of book that adults choose to show their kids ""so you think you have it bad..."" and some are caught up in the novelty of the easily readable poetic form, but I don't think many children will enjoy it."
4,"Yes, I know it's good lit, but...","Written in free-verse poetry, this novel is a harsh depiction of growing up in the dust bowl of Oklahoma during the Great Depression. The descriptive language is wonderful, especially accountings of the dust storms. While deserving of the Newbery for its literary value, I found it rather heavy-handed - too much death and destruction and too serious and sober a protagonist. Even Frank McCourt found a little light and humor in his terrible childhood of ""Angela's Ashes""."
5,Superb!,"I just finished reading Out of the Dust and am still blinking back tears and have a large lump in my throat. This is one of the most beautifully written pieces of literature I've read in a very long time. Hesse's imagery and the music of her language is exquisite. Thank you Karen, for the research, dedication and love it must have taken to write this. It's a gift to readers of all ages."
2,I'm traumitized for all eternity,"I couldn't even finish this book. Someone might find it interesting and the only reason why I gave it more than one star is because it's decently well written. It disgusted me though. There was too much giving birth, nasty sicknesses, horrible death ext. I truly wish I had never picked this book up. It will haunt my dreams forever!"
1,"Repetative, boring, and utterly depressing","I had to read this book as a school assignment. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but never this bad. Anytime anything good happened, it would immediately make a reference back to any one of the abundance of horrid events that had happened through out t the book. I would always leave class bored and depressed."
4,death to us part,When she was in the kichen Daddy left keroscene on the stove so ma got burned and a week later ma and baby Fraklin (DIED).
4,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust, a heartfelt tale that vividly describes the tragic life of living in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Knowing that on any one day you could come home and your house could be covered in a drift of dust. Choking down food while you feel the sandy, grit slide down your throat. Billie Jo Kelby was comfortable living her life with her Mother and Father in the dust bowl until a horrible accident left her mother with mortal burns and her hands just stumps of what used to be able play the most beautiful of piano ballads. With very little to live for and a quite distant relationship with her father and eventually the death of her mother while giving birth to her baby brother who also died. Billie Jo had to get out. Leaving what was left of her life behind only to find out what really matters most to her. Eventually coming home to find the faintest glimmer of hope in what used to be a plain of despair."
5,Taste the Dust,"More than any other book I've read, this one woke up all the sences. If you ever wondered what it was like to live during this period of history, don't bother with nonfiction, this story makes history live."
5,Hard Luck,"""And I strech my fingers over the keys and I play."" This quote is of great signifigance because Billie Jo can finally play the piano again. It was a long hard road for Billie Jo Kelby. From running away to California or to watching her mother die it seemed that buried under tidal waves of dust and tons of dead wheat no luck would luck would ever come to her. All she had was ripped away when her scorche hands could not play the piano. I particularly liked all the metaphors and how Billie Jo beat the odds and succeeded. Some metaphors are ""Ma was a column of fire""(Hesse, 61) and ""brown earth rained down from the sky""(Hesse, 143). This book was not cheerful but extremely melancholy. This book is best suited for ages 12 and up."
4,Out of the Dust: A Review and More,"I think the book, Out of the Dust was a good to great book. It leads through Billie Jo's life in the dust bowl and how she felt and the ways that she suffered through those two years. When the accident happened between Billie Jo and her mother, it changed Billie Jo for ever. She no longer could play the piano, and her hands were scared for life, where they would peel and crack untill they were blistered again and again. At the end of the book, Billie Jo's father finds another woman to love, and at first, she doesn't really appreciate her, but tords the very end, she learns to like her, and can't wait untill she finally stays for good..."
3,Out Of The Dust,Out of the DustOut of the Dust was a book that I wouldn't recommend to other people. This book is about a girl that lives in the dust bowl and what she goes through. In the book there is very little writing about the actual dust storms and how they were. I thought that when I was going to read this book that there would be more descriptive events and how the dust bowl came about and it would be more historical and I would learn more than I already knew. I thought that the reading went very slowly and there was not enough action in this book. I give this book 3 out of 5 star because I think that people with a historical background of this event would take it more personably and possibly enjoy it.
3,Great for a book report,"If you don't have much time left before that next book report is due and you need a really short book, Out of the Dust is for you. Set in the Great Depression out in the Oklahoma Panhandle, you follow Billie Jo, a young teenage girl who is trying to survive after her mother and baby brother died with no wheat on her father's farm growing because of the lack of rain. This book is written in free-hand poetry which makes it a lot shorter than it looks. I used this for my last book report and I got it read in less than an hour and a half. Don't read this though if you are just reading it for fun--there are many better books out there to read."
5,Out of the Dust,"Out of the Dust is a sad story. You get the feeling that you are in the book and you are Billie Jo, but you are not. It's like you can see everything that is happening. It is one of the best books I've ever read. You can only imagine how great it really is. But when Billie Jo's mother dies its sad. I loved this book and I think that everyone should read a great book like this."
4,Out of the Dust,"Billie Jo Kelby is an average 13 year old girl who was living through rough times during the Dust Bowl. The book was very pleasing to read. In a few parts of the book I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Then again, sometimes I felt like she was overstressing a little too much.When Billie Jo's mother died, it seemed as though she lost the biggest part of her. She had no real connection with her father, so, while her mother was gone she was left alone.I could comprehend the pain she was going through and wished that someone could have been there to comfort her. The greatly descriptive details made me comprehend the way her house was swarming with dust.This truly is an amazing book to read. If you read this book I am sure that you will get the message that Karen Hesse is trying to express. This book will teach you that you should love your family and have faith in the people that you love."
3,Audio verion not so great,"I am a middle school teacher. My classes include readers who are behind or not on grade level. I thought if I ordered the book on CD students would be given an opportnity to better understand the narrator. The narrator choice for the CD did not do this job. She spoke very quickly, rushing from page to page. My class ended up reading the book aloud rather than listening to the CD. I was disappointed with the CD, but my students enjoyed the content of the novel."
4,Sad and Clear,I think this is a sad story and will make you cry. This book is very clear because the poems are detailed.
5,wish it were available,"I bought the vinyl when it came out, haven't heard it for over 17 years since I bought a CD player. This album is one of the few treasures I wish I owned on CD. Great rockin guitar, and surprisingly good vocals."
3,"A lot of filler, but worth it for a Link Wray fan","Most of these songs are throwaways, especially Wild Party, which was a real waste of vinyl. However, Switchblade and especially The Sky is Falling, ending with Link's thrilling rave up, make this album worth owning."
5,COMPULSIVE READING,"AFTER READING BELGARETH, IT MADE ME WANT TO RE-READ 'THE BELGARIAD' AND 'THE MALLOREON' I AM AT PRESENT RE-READING 'THE TAMULI' TO BE FOLLOWED BY 'THE ELENIUM'. WHEN 'POLGARA' IS PUBLISHED THIS IS ANOTHER MUST FOR FANTASY FANS"
2,just a rehash,"This book is, unfortunately, mostly just a rehashof plot elements previously mentioned in Eddings'previous books. While there are a few new eventshere and there, the fact that the overall plotis already somewhat obvious makes it tedious toread. This books was hugely disappointing afterall the other excellent and captivating booksby Eddings. It is almost as if it was written bysomeone else."
2,GET A NEW PLOT LINE!!!,If you are truly interested in reading more of the same drivel that he has pumped out since the Diamond Throne then go right ahead and get this nicely expensive book that will contribute to his royalties...and persuade him to make more boring rehashes of the same characters...COME ON DAVID...Have some originality that many other authors have
2,Time for a new story Mr. Eddings,"Honestly, it's time for a new story. David Eddings has told the same worn-out story at least 3 times now. (Belgariad, Mallorean [sp], Diamond Throne, etc.) ""Belgarath"" is an expert re-hashing and fleshing out of story already presented in other novels. The only thing that keeps Eddings' work going is his characterizations, and even his characters are starting to look the same....."
2,DON'T try to be funny,"To be fair, I'll admit that by the time I read this book, I already wasn't into David Eddings anymore. Still, I USED to like the Balgariad. After readings this book I've come up with a rule: never get to in to things. Belgarath was one of my favorite characters up to the ""Malorian."" Now he just seems stupid. If someone can live that long without learning anything, he MUST be. Maybe David Eddings never spoke to old people, and so doesn't realize that years themselves - even if nothing tangable is acheived - make a differance. Also, through this book Eddings managed to do the nearly impossable task of taking out any element of magic and mistery that remained.. An amazing talent, but one, I hope, that will not be wide spread"
2,*YAWN*,"Very broing and truly disappointing......other then the maybe four humorous parts, this book went absoutely nowhere. I dont think I will ever look at Belgarth the same way.....I would rather scrape my eye out with a dull rusty spoon than read this again"
3,More schlock from a master schlock artist...,"Look, you don't read David Eddings for classic literature, you read him for the cool sorcery, the sharply drawn characters and a sense of humor.Belgarath the Sorcerer delivers, but it's definitely of the meat and potatoes variety. It's a trip down memory lane for those who have waded through the Belgariad and the Mallorean (which both became progressively more ponderous and lacking in new ideas).The fact that this book even exists suggests that Mr. Eddings is running either a bit low on new ideas, or his bank account, or both."
1,i love this book,now the reason that i gave this book only one star is because it like all of the other books by david and leigh eddings in the belgariad and mallorean series' are only available as audio books. now don't get me wrong i love my kindle but i didn't buy it to listen to books i bought it to READ books.
3,Read better,"The book said nothing new and the characters tend to irritate after a while, but what I really want to comment on is some of the other reviews from British readers. If your going to share your views all well and good but please spell things correctly or you make us all look stupid."
2,J.P. Linton narration is ...,J. P. Linton's dramatized narration is either overdone or underdone to the point that it sounds forced. Listening to it was laaborously cumbersome; thus I could not finish listening past chapter three.
1,"great book, not on kindle, should bed","Let me start by saying this isn't a one start rant due to the book not being available on kindle. This is a one start rant because Del Rey let a great book go to print, in paperback, missing three chapters, literally goes from chapter 45 and jumps to chapter 49. This isn't Amazon's problem, but if the publishers released the book for kindle, maybe I'd have gotten my $7.99 worth!"
5,Filled in a lot of the gaps left by earlier books.,"This book filled in a lot of the gaps and elaborated on many of the things implied but never fully explained in ""THE BELGARIAD"" and ""THE MALLOREAN"" series. I thought it was an excellent book and a fitting conclusion for the earlier books."
2,Yechh...,"This could have been a cool story. Could have. That is, if it weren't so liberally punctuated with the bad humor that has become Eddings' trademark. We don't really get to know the characters, with the exception of only a few scenes, and the story is just one rehashing of Belgarath and Polgara being Great Sorcerers after another. Boring. The more he extends a series, the worse it gets (same with Sparhawk). So stick with the books from the beginning."
4,Belgarath the sorcerer,"In my opinion this book was more or less unbeatable, but as i said thats my opinion. If you dont like heavy reading, i suggest you read the Belgariad and Mallorian first. in Belgarath the sorceror there are a lot of names to remember,and the belgariad introduces these at a lesser extent so you can actually remember what its telling you!"
1,"IT WAS OKAY, BUT........","Did anyone else notice anything wrong with this book? The greatest danger Belgarath faces in this book is when he first meets Torak. Through the rest of the book, even when he fights Zedar in Morindim(DID ANYONE ALSO NOTICE HOW INCOMPETENT AND WEAKLY SKILLED IN SORCERY ZEDAR WAS?), you know that he isn't in any danger. Even CTUCHIK is shown as being incompetent when compared to Belgarath.If you're reading this book too see some excitement in Belgarath life, don't. Read the third book of the Belgariad and see CTUCHIK give Belgarath the fight of his life."
4,A Good Start into Science Fiction.,I just started reading science fiction of this sort and I was thrilled with this book. I was eager to continue reading about this strange new world.
2,Just reread the Belgariad instead.,"Worse than I expected, and my expectations were pretty low to begin with. There is very little new here, and what is new doesn't jibe very well with what we already know about this world. This is the first Eddings book I absolutely will not read again."
5,best book I have read for while,"Belgarath the Sorcerer is great! It's best for readers who stick with a book even when it gets long and a bit complicated. It gives a profound insight into Belgarath and his origins, and how Aldur's disciples came about."
3,An entertaining historical view of Belgarath the sorcerer,"This book is a prequel to the Belgariad. While the book keeps the classic humor of Belgarath, it does diminish the mystique of Belgarath with self depreciating comments. Woe to the beginning reader who unwittingly reads this book first before reading the Belgariad"
2,Too much yet not enough,"Being a fan of Edding's work I was disappointed in Belgarath. It was such a long work and I felt needlessly so. While I agree with earlier reviewers that one doesn't read Edding's for literary genius, I do expect the books to be well thought out and entertaining. Going into this book you know the outcome if you read the Belgariad. That makes it hard to inject any suspense into the work, which meant that it needed to be overcome with skillful writing and plot twists. I didn't feel that there was any of this in this work. When a situation headed towards a difficult problem the ""necessity"" or ""Garion's friend"" bailed everyone out conveniently. I just didn't find this work to be very imaginative and below Edding's standard in the first five books of the Belgariad.This book is like the movie sequel that didn't need to be made. Does Smoky and the Bandit III ring a bell with anyone?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Backstory the elder.In a similar fashion to the Polgara the Sorceress volume, here we get the backstory of ubersorcerer Belgarath, and learn why he is so.It all has to do with good gods and bad goods and the disciples of such, along with whacky sorcerer-name prefixes.Old is certainly the word for this bloke, and it gives you more of an overview of what is going on. Again, basically better than the main series.2.5 out of 5"
2,Too many inconsitencies,"As an avid reader of Eddings works, including High Hunt, I found Belgarath the Sorcerer, and Polgara for that matter, a real disappointment. There are a number of inconsistencies between them and the Belgariad. For example, all of Garions ancestors call Belgarath ""Grandfather"", but in the original series, when Garion first calls Belgarath ""Grandfather"", it comes as a surprise to him (Belgarath). Polgara's engagement also conflicts with what Aunt Pol tells Garion when he suggests she marry Durnik in the Belgariad also. I have read both the Belgariad and the Malloreans, and the Elenium and Tamuli series for that matter, numerous times, I doubt that I will revisit Belgarath or Polgara."
2,Go to the movie-theatre instead,"This is really no good... The whole book (and all the others in the series) coul be directly used as manuscripts for bad Hollywood movies... Nothing special, really... This CAN'T be compared with classics as ""Wheel of Time"" by Robert Jordan or ""The Lord of the Rings"" by J.R.R. Tolkien..."
5,Well worth the wait,"The crowning achievement of both the Belgariad and the Mallorean. I was waiting for this book since I was quite young and picked up ""Pawn of Prophecy"" at the store. I waited until I thought I was going to explode for each new book in the series to come out, and after waiting soooo long, all I can say is it was worth every moment! This series of twelve books is my most precious collection in my stacks of books, they make me laugh, shout for joy, weep tears of sadness and brings me into a world as real as the one you ar I live in. I love them all, Durnik, Barak, Silk, Garion, Ce'Nedra and all the rest....yes you too Yarblek. If I could do but one thing in this life it would be to seek out Mr. Eddings and thank him for writing such a series of books that has made my life better by reading them over and over again. Thank you!!!!!!!"
5,Sheer brilliance,"I absolutely loved this book, one of the best he has ever written, the power and the passion that Eddings portrays is magnificent. I've read it a dozen times and still find something new"
2,"Excellent book, terrible edition","Excellent book, have had many paperback copies over the years. Sadly this Kindle edition is full of typos and spelling errors. It gets so bad in places it is actually difficult to make out the sense of the sentence.Excellent book but sadly let down by this Kindle edition. Kindle books may be cheaper than print books but we should still get the same level of proofing and editing as the print customer. Kindle editions shouldn't be a poorer reading experience!!!"
2,sun dogs,Not what I expected. The movie is about the life of people in a warm climit. Nothing to do with Jimmy Buffett. Not sure where he comes into play.
4,cute but,"It looks exactly as the displayed image. The back fell off the first one that I received. The company that I ordered from, CDI Watches through Amazon, diligently and quickly replaced the watch. The description is not exactly accurate (to me)...'hands telling the time' to me meant that Mickey Mouse's hands tell the time. But it means that Mickey's hands are permanently at 3:50 and the thin double-bladed metallic hands tell the actual time. Those thin hands are a little difficult to see; also has a red second hand. Look at picture carefully; it is accurate. A light burnt brick red diamond shape and a darker muted plum colored diamond shape on inside of band. A plus for me is that it is packaged in a metal box. Box China, movement Japan. If you can overlook the issue with the hands, it's a respectable watch to add to a collection."
3,A selection of Ella's best,"This is a nice collection of Ella's recordings on the Decca label, from 1938-1955. The songs were selected from a list of producer Milt Gabler. The sound quality is good."
5,Best Sex Song,"This was, for a period of roughly a month, played every time my girlfriend and I 'enjoyed each other's company."" The poor girl was tired of it after a while I am sure, but I couldn't resist. It is a really good song, especially for those cheese-ball trance types like myself who prefer something BETWEEN DJ Tiesto and Enya. Again: try during..."
2,Not so happy,This was cute at first look. But once it arrived I was let down. The v in the front goes all the way down to my belly button. It is sheer and you would have to wear some short of tank under it which would dominate over the cutness of the shit. I will be returning this. sad.
4,Cute!,I paired this top with a bright colored cami underneath for a very flattering look! I received compliments all day long!
3,This runs very small!,"i wear a 2X or 3X. I ordered it in a 4X because I wanted it longer and loose. It is very form fitting. It is pretty, but barely fits comfortably. It is veryy pretty though."
3,Right in the middle,If I would have read the previous reviews I would have known what to expect...a bit shocked when I opened the package and saw what appeared to be a lace pajama top. After trying it on with a black cami I have decided to keep it.
2,Not too happy,"I had this over shirt out of the packaging for all of 10 minutes when one of the rhinestone buttons fell off. I have a long torso and the the flair sat well above my hips and made me appear to be a lot wider than I am. If you have a narrow shape this shirt may work well for you, but if you have any curves to you at all I wouldn't recommend this item for you at all."
2,Beautiful top; runs small,"I bought this gorgeous blouse based on the photo. Lace all over, Rhinestone buttons, flared bottom..........thought it would be great for my daughter to wear at a formal event on our cruise (with a camisole underneath, of course). Well, the blouse, sized medium, ran so small that my daughter, a size 8, couldn't get it on. And since there is no elastic, zipper and the buttons are 'faux', the only way to put it on is over your head. She was afraid that the delicate material would rip. The company I bought this from shipped very quickly, so I hope that this rating is just for the blouse and will not effect the rating of the service I received from the store."
3,"not quite what I expected, but still good","This item shipped fast, and arrived before expected, but not quite as expected.The pictures make it look like there's a bluish/whitish shell under the black lace, so you could wear it in public.When I got it, it was only the black lace, no shell. I can wear it over other things, and it's very cute, so I'll keep it.Be warned tho, if you're expecting what the picture shows, be prepared to find something to wear under it!"
3,dissapointed,"It looks as shown but manage your expectation:1) It's short (and thats that I have a short torso), sits above waist for awkward fit2) i had the opposite problem, it ran big (XL) & is very stretchy so it didnt cling3) my blouse came with 2 big holes on the side (I would have never known IF it wasnt for the contrast against the white label)I had to keep it cause I was attending a wedding & didnt I notice the holes until THAT day. You need to cut the product label off cause it shows right through the blouse (sewn into lower side hem)But it is beautiful & i did get lots of compliments, it just didnt fit the way I expected."
3,"Cute, but no buttons","I love this top, but I had a similar problem as the others. Had it for about an hour before the buttons fell off... :(It's super cute though!"
3,"Pretty, but sizing is way off","I ordered my usual size, and it was 2 sizes too small. Now I have this fairly inexpensive blouse that I don't wanna bother returning. Maybe I'll diet."
3,Not Worth What I Paid.,"I received the package like a week later so the timing wasnt all that bad.Although when I opened the box, the blouse was not really what i expected.In the picture, the blouse looks cute, retro and looks like it accents the body.Well first, i know for sure the white color in the picture is a shirt under - take that into condiseration.The top is basically like a fishnet!I ordered a large which seems like I made a good choice because the medium seems like it would be too tight because this isnt a stretchy material. ( i havent tried the shirt on yet though)But I paid like $25 total with shipping and handling and this top isnt even worth half!I mean, I'll wear it and try to rock it with some leggings or something but My point is the top looks nothing Like the picure and its nothing worth what I paid.After I try it on, ill post another review."
3,Very lovely,"Here's the scoop I am 42 yrs old I love wearing lace but only with a camisole underneath, now I realize I could have put one underneath it but, anytime I pay 15.00 or more for an item I expect it to have a camisole with it. Please don't get me wrong this is a very lovely top but just not for me."
4,Another Great Read by Denise Hamilton....,"""Sugar Skull"" is the 2nd novel I have read by author, Denise Hamilton. I enjoyed reading this novel a lot and found it difficult to put down. It is fast paced, witty & edgy.What I enjoy most about ""Sugar Skull"" is how Ms. Hamilton is able to weave several stories into to one novel (""Sugar Skull has teenage squatters, a mayoral race, and Mexican American music) and tie it altogether into one nicely wrapped package. Also, Eve Diamond, the main character in this novel, is well developed and very likable."
4,Remarkably light yet incredibly dense,"This book is a deceptively light read. Gilson's writing is so clear that it's easy to miss the profundity of it.Just as he compares the history of philosophy to a scientist's laboratory, I'd like to compare this book to a science class. That is to say, do your homework. When a teacher explains things in class, everything makes perfect sense, but unless you take what the teacher said and see how it applies to different situations, you won't learn very much.This book is great, but I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have time to really think about the things he says. Of course reading it quickly won't hurt, but just like you wouldn't chug a bottle of fine wine, save this one for when you've got time to really appreciate it.One more thing I'd like to mention is how impressed I was by his ability to show the greatest respect to philosophers of previous ages even while he explained why their ideas are hopelessly mistaken."
4,Excellent scholarship...,"I was thrilled that this work is back in print. It is a valuable and, indeed, essential book for any library of a philosopher, historian, or serious scholar. Gilson's book, taken from a series of ""lectures"" is highly-readable and is philosophically sound. His critique of P. Abailard is accurate."
2,"Gilson has spoken, the matter is settled","""The Unity of Philosophical Experience"" is an incredibly boring book by leading ""Neo""-Thomist expositor Etienne Gilson. But then, have you ever read a *fun* book by a Thomist? I didn't think so either.Like an ersatz pope, Gilson speaks ex cathedra, knows all the philosophical answers (imagine that!) and attacks everyone else, including fellow Catholics such as St. Bonaventure, Thomas à Kempis or Meister Eckhart. Brother Etienne hath spoken, the matter is settled?When finished, our knight-errant have valiantly defeated the Platonists, Nominalists, Cartesians, Kantians, Hegelians, Marxists and one Giovanni Gentile. Despite this, we are not any wiser than when we started the journey.Besides, what on earth is the *point* of philosophy, if all important issues are known only through revelation, anyway?Two stars."
5,Very Satisfied,Exactly as promised!! The same product that I was buying from my vet for almost half the price!!! Thanks......sp
1,Go Region 2 if you want to see this film,"I'm afraid to say, that despite ALL of Facets' posturing, they've done a lackluster job on this truly important film. An unconverted PAL source with tons of ghosting and combing. NON-ANAMORPHIC and interlaced. But the Artificial Eye version. It's not super, but it's a lot better than this typically poor job."
3,A change in taste,"I am a teenager, and I am not a country lover at all. This is probably one of the few country groups I like... my friend introduced it to me and I love the songs. I love all music now, and I don't have to say ""with the exception of country"" because I DO like some country, not ashamed to say it. Enjoy!! Even though some of the songs aren't #1 hits like ""Amazed"" and ""I'm already there"" I enjoy the other songs just as much!! Worth having :)"
2,Where is Lonestar?,"I got hooked on country through Lonestar, have all their albums, and of course expanded my so limited country music experience, by listening to lots of different artists. Could not wait to get the newest Lonestar, but I am not sure who I listend to just now, the only song that sounded like the group I liked, is the title ""I am already there"", seems to me the guys are trying to be to much Rock and Roll rather than sticking with the old familiar sound, new is good but not always best. I am for one am disappointed, this is not one CD that I will be playing over and over again. Don't know which direction their going but hope they come back."
3,What more can you say,There is not much that can me said about this album. This CD is a good one to listen to for those like country with a little bit of rock in it.
3,Decent but nothing new,"I think I was addicted to Lonestar's last album, Lonely Grill, so I had huge expectations for their latest effort. The first time I listened to this CD I was really disappointed--the first track is catchy and the second is OK, but the next few are just blah, not musically interesting and not particularly well written. It all sounded somewhat familiar--every time a song started I thought I MUST have heard it before, it sounded so much like things they have already done. But by about the sixth track, things were back on track, and the last few songs are good. The more I listened to this CD, the better I liked it--it is certainly NOT a flop, the band sounds great and I love Richie McDonald's voice. If you are a long-time Lonestar fan, then you'll like this CD--it's nothing new but it's comfortable listening. But if you are looking for something to top Lonely Grill, forget it--this just isn't quite as good."
4,Lonestar,"Excellent group, I always buy their CDs...they rarely have a dud! As the song says, ""I'm Already There"".This CD is another in a line of great CDs."
1,Wasted Shelf-Space,"I will summarize the album, quickly. Not country. Not at all.It seems like Lonestar went downhill, after their debut album, hit the stores, back in 1995. Their sound was non-consistent, as was the way they dressed.I gave this album 3 or 4 listens (can't really remember), and I can say that there are 2 great songs. ""I'm Already There (though it reeks of Amazed) and ""Without You""; which is one of my favorite Lonestar songs. Had these songs been included on their last album, it would have been a whole lot better.My advice to anyone who is thinking about purchasing the album - ...Don't put money in this 80's rock-band-wannabe group."
5,"Don't listen to critics, this CD is awesome.","They soar on power ballads ""Not a Day Goes By"" and ""I'm Already There"". ""Without You"" is the surprise of the CD not the disappointment. This song will have AOR fans blushing. ""I want to be the One"" and ""Unusually Unusual"" are super catchy and addictive. This CD has something for all fans of music: Soaring vocals, upbeat country rock songs, power ballads, etc.This could be album of the year at the awards show."
4,There are certain things you need to consider;,"If you were a fan of Lonestar because of their Lonely Grill album, then do not buy this CD. Lonely Grill was much more ""country"" than this one. Except for ""I'm already there"", this CD is not typical Lonestar. I must say, I was a little dissapointed at first, however the more I listened to this CD, the more it grew on me. It's an interesting new sound you cant dismiss, but I hope they come back to their original sound on the next CD. I would buy this CD if you're a big fan, however those who like their past songs better stick with the old CD, they wont find it here."
4,"Very well taped, for a 1974 album.","This German version of the Mirror from Spooky Tooth, is very well taped for a 1974 album, each instruments can be heard seperatly from the sound image,"
5,Quality literature for young adults!!,"Christina Hergenrader's books are super! They feature REAL characters dealing with REAL-WORLD issues with a Christian influence. Ms. Hergenrader does a great job at presenting Christian values to a pre-teen audience without being ""preachy"". The characters are intriguing, and the story lines are about issues that all kids can relate to. The devotionals included at the end of each chapter are great conversation starters for your family or youth group."
4,Ian goes New Wave,"In perhaps a last gasp at mainstream pop success, Ian Matthews recorded this little gem in 1983 in the UK (after five years living in Seattle). Notable for a lovely cover of ""The Wild Places"" by Duncan Brown, ""Shook"" also features an eclectic selection of originals, including the futuristic ""Tomorrow Falls on Saturday"". Interesting guests include drummer Robert Henrit (The Kinks) and local Seattle rock guitar legend Bruce Hazen."
4,excellent presentation of Holbein's Danse Macabre works,"The woodcuts are beautifully reproduced. Included are the verses that originally accompanied each woodcut. The text is provided both in the original Latin and in modern translation. The Danse Macabre was originally a visual artistic presentation, and this book is faithful to that performance. The explanatory text before the woodcuts begin is short and to the point. Dover allows the art to speak for itself, rather than 'interpreting' it for the viewer."
2,Tiny images suitible for postage stamps,Holbeins illustrations are brilliant and fascinating. This book is very inexpensive. These two factors should make it a great addition to any library. But the images are something like 2 inches square. You can't see any detail really. I was disappointed and I guess I'll have to find another book as I would like to enjoy this macabre and fascinating series.
3,tiny woodcuts,"The woodcuts are very small, maybe 2 inches each side.The details are hard to see this small. The Complete Woodcuts of Albrecht Durer is fabulous for observing large woodcuts.With their side aside, the playfully dark figures are amusing for those who enjoy the morbid."
2,Got a Magnifying Glass?,"...You're going to need it to view these lovely but frustratingly tiny prints. I don't know why they are so little, they do deserve more size so one can appreciate how great they are. Many reviewers here lament the same condition. Does anyone know where the complete set can be had in a book that permits more than a squinty glimpse of these marvelous images? That would be well worth having. Some of the prints seem to be omitted from the series for some reason also. I remember seeing online ""Death and the Drunkard"", the skeleton pouring a tankard of ale down the unfortunate man's throat. Also ""Death and the Idiot"", Death playing a tune for him on some bagpipes, if I remember correctly."
5,The Lost Cord CD,This is a fabulous CD. I am convinced that I will be waiting for any new CD that this Author has to offer! His work is amazing!
3,beautiful music,I've enjoyed this collection of songs. I was looking for an joyful way to listen to the salfaggio scale that wasn't just tones. This fit the bill. I find the songs relaxing even when I'm working around the house or at the gym. I would say they helped me focus more on the tasks at hand.
4,very good but not 5 stars,"I think that this book was very good, i finished it in like 1 day and I don't normally do that. I usually go and hang out with friends but I believed that this book was kind of historical in the fact that it relates closely to Christopher Columbus and explained the differences of culture. I felt that this relates to the past world in the times of imperialism. The difference of cultures and the desire to follow your dream and create your own place that you can get away to."
2,A feeble light shines in the Dark Ages...,"This is the story of a brave Pictish (Scottish) girl who falls in love with a dumb, strong Norse invader. I love Marillier's writing, but this book could have been so much more! It comes across as a very pale imitation of her first novel, Daughter of the Forest. Do yourself a favor and read that one instead."
3,Didn't quite come together,"I enjoy Ms. Marillier's writing style, but Wolfskin never quite came together into the book I was hoping for. Eyvind was likable enough, but a little too dense to truly sympathize with. Nessa never really has time to develop into a strong character. This is a book I enjoyed reading, but I'm not likely to pick it up again."
1,Horrible....,"I loved the Sevenwaters Trilogy so much but this book is just horrible. I tried so hard to like it that I actually read to page 225 which is way beyond my normal commitment to a dumb book. The 3 primary characters are either disgustingly evil, a gorgeous dumb murderer/warrior, or a too late in arriving heroine --- too late to save my interest. I stopped just about where she was going to ""save"" him --- this theme felt to similar to Liadan saving the Painted Man in the Son of the Shadows book. At least the murdering Painted Man seemed smart before he was reformed."
5,Witnessing,"The Secret of Soul Winning was an inspirational source of material. I wish I'd had this book a few months ago to accompany the lesson on ""Witnessing"" that was being studied in my Adult Sunday School Class. This book breaks it down for you. Gives you step by step guide, with Bible references. I would recommend this book and others written by Stephen Olford. ""What worked in the past, works today."" Regina F. Rogers"
3,Secret of Soul Winning,"I guess I expected more out of Stephen Olford. He was a masterful speaker and writer but this is not his best effort even if it is considered a ""classic."" The stories of how the Olfords engaged in personal evangelism is interesting but not likely to inspire someone to go and do likewiese if they lack the confidence to do so."
4,Getting Ahead U. S. History,"The earlier segments are boring, but there was no photography back then. However, I thought the later segments were interesting and they kept the attention of my fifth grader."
5,A must-have for any landscape painter,"I am a Virginia landscape painter and have kept this book close at hand in my studio for many years. While I do not paint like Richard, I nonetheless pull this book out out several times a month, for inspiration or information or just to look at how he has handled various problems of light and color. As noted in another review, this is not a step-by-step book, but rather a beautiful record of the process of one dedicated painter that will inspire and encourage."
3,Art for artists,"First, I should clearly state that after reading Mr. Crozier's book, there is no doubt that he is a dedicated and talented plein air landscape artist. The book is filled with example after example of his artwork and if you like Crozier's style and approach towards landscape painting, this book will be a joy.I, however, am not too happy with his choice of subjects. I'll explain. In the text there are numerous painting of fairly featureless hillsides, explorations of both man-created landscape and naturally occuring symmetrical landscapes, and quite a fair number of landscapes with palettes that seem somewhat dull (but mostly likely quite accurate). While many of these painting he pulls off nicely, too many of them are paintings only another artist could fully appreciate."
3,Silly... (3.5 Stars),"...but isn't that why people love Luda? Seriously, the Austin Powers business in the lyrics is corny as hell, but Luda pulls it off by just not taking things too seriously. DJ Green Lantern flips the Austin Powers theme for the beat, and it's done nicely. Nice single from Ludacris."
5,Excellent information on the exotic pheasants.,"This book tells you about housing, feed & raising pheasants. It's a little outdated as to the availability of the exotics. Very informative on the different breeds of pheasants. Overall a great book for the beginning pheasant raiser."
1,bullcrap product,"this does not even fit a dell 4600 i put that up on the search and it brought me to this and i bought it and it dosn,t even fit dont say it fits dell if it dosnt."
2,This is not his natural style,"1st of all let me say I think Ian is a real talent. Unfortunately, he diverted too far from his natural style here. I suppose he was trying to get air play and feed his pocketbock. I don't blame him, although his real talent does not come through here. He probably agrees as well. I bought this because I like most of his stuff. Glad this wasn't my 1st Ian Matthews purchase because I wouldn't have bought his other great material. Ian, stay where your roots are because that's where your love of music come through best and where you really shine. thx, for the effort. LOL, Skip"
4,excellent,"Realization works on the same bedrock as Miles'Bitches Brew: set a sturdy ostinato bass line, and let the band run Saturn rings roundAnd believe it or not this album bites even sharper. Miles devised the blueprints, but Henderson here cuts the layers of percussion, ups the volume on all the players, and rests the music on a fat electric four string ground. The playing is great, and while Brew was a test of mixing jazz and rock, this is jazz that just plain rocks.Get it"
3,Hmmm..2.55 stars only!,"This book, in my opinion, is not a very good book especially if you are the kind who enjoys an intellectual challenge. But it takes up a hell of a lot of time making you work through silly repetitive exercises and never ever giving you a challenging problem!! And doesnt give you any sort of ""insight"" into calculus... In short its like the ""The Ultimate Calculus Cookbook!"" But cookbooksdont really increase your math ability and may even suppress it!But theres another side to the story.. if you are kind who is interested in just knowing the recipies and how to apply them( engineering students)...then this must THE BEST BOOK you can find. And this can also be very helpful if you find calculus ""hard""!!BUT LEMME WARN YOU AGAIN IF YOU USE UR BRAINS A LOT DONT GO FOR THIS BOOK.. U'LL SOON STAR GETTING DAMN BORED!!"
3,---> Better Than Nothing <---,"I am on the brink of completing Calc II. Between this book and 2 other calc textbooks that I have, Larson 7e, and Stewart 5e - ET, I finally made it through calculus. (Damn public school system.) There are topics in this book that my other 2 calc books have provided a much better explanation for. If the three authors were to collaborate they could possibly produce a rather fine Calculus textbook. ---- Ultimately, there is NO perfect textbook.If you find that you are having difficulty understanding concepts in one textbook try finding an equal counterpart by a different author. It has helped me.Read and learn all you can. Don't be a participant in the dumbing down process."
3,good for the money,"I prefer all cotton sheets, but these are soft and smooth. After about 5 washings they are starting to get loose threads around the elastic, and they fit katty-wampus on my thick mattress. But they're fine in a pinch or in a guest room."
2,"Inexpensive, yes, but still not worth it.","These are more like 200-250 thread count. Soft at first, but after a couple of washings, they feel rough, loose their shape, and wrinkle easily. I purchased several different colors in twin and king sizes and all have been a disappointment."
2,300 count burgandy sheets,"These sheets are the worst in the dryer. I have washed my sheets 3 times and still get the colored lint off the sheets. My dryer is a mess and so is the floor. I do not recommend these sheets in this color or you will have the mess every time you wash them. All the other colors are fine, it is just the burgandy. Can anyone tell me why this happens??Linda Perry"
5,My favorite Pete Fountain album,"This is my favorite Pete Fountain album, and I've been a fan since the '50s. Ja-Da and Tiger Rag are my favorites of all his numbers, with the latter being truly sensational.There is a variety of groups and styles on the two discs, so this is a very good introduction to his work."
5,Awesome Movie,This movie was one of those that I heard about and just had to watch. After a few clips I was sold. This movie has everything!
5,Hope Springs Eternal,"E.J. Dionne is such a fine writer and historian that one can be forgiven for believing, for wanting to believe, that the self-flagellating and pusillanimous lot that is the Democratic Party leadership these days can actually pull the country from the neo-conservative, bible-thumping swamp in which it is mired. ""They Only Look Dead"" was written before the Supreme Court selected a president for us, before Good King George took us to war on a pretext (with strong Democratic support), and before the popular ""no millionaire left behind"" program. Mr. Dionne is well aware of the cyclical nature of history and draws many apt parallels between the Gilded Age and our present malaise. So maybe he's right, maybe (triple cliche alert) it is always darkest before the dawn, maybe the pendulum has swung too far to the right. Maybe if the party of FDR and JFK follows Mr. Dionne's advice and remembers who they are and where they came from then happy days will be here again."
4,Excellent choice to experience a different side of Dio.,"I happened to stumble across this album a while back and was glad I did. If you are looking to experience a different side of Ronnie James Dio than you are probably used to, check out Elf. This album, and the beefier ""Trying to burn the Sun,"" both have good blues/rock influences and are very interesting listening. Ronnie Dio is indeed a man of many talents."
3,It works!,"Easy to install, holds 2 bikes. I have a hybrid (heavy) and a road bike (not heavy). Seems to support both OK. I like it. Minimal space requirements, too."
1,PRICE CHANGE,THE PRICE ON THIS ITEM IN 1/2010 WAS 26.00 ONE YEAR LATER IT IS 50.00 WHAT A JOKE.Racor HFB-2R Double Horizontal Folding Bike Rack with Shelf
4,Racor 2-bike wall stand,"1. Assembles well, fasteners are sufficient for task.2. Assembly instructions lacking in clarity3. Seems sturdy.4. Holds two road bikes without problem."
5,Powerful and True... Not for the faint hearted,"This book could change your life... if you will release your fear, apprehension and mis-trust. Listen to what you feel while you read the pages... read for depth... read freely and hopefully. Then you will be answered.Caveat... remember after reading, you will still be confronted with the life you are living. But it's OK, use what you have learned in the book and look for Him in your life."
1,WHATEVER THIS BOOK DID FOR ELVIS CLEARLY WASN'T ENOUGH,Its incredible to me how they try to sell this book on the back of Elvis' name when they poor guy died at 42 of a drugs overdose having had his life lurch out of control in various ways for years before. If this book is responsible for Elvis' 'success' was it also responsible for his misery and his premature death?
1,Not the swashbuckling Zorro you'd expect,"I wish I could give this DVD a favorable review. Unfortunately, I cannot. If you are expecting the Zorro of the 1820's of Southern California who fought against tyranny, you won't find him here. Nor will you find the Capitan or Sgt. Garcia. This is the story of Zorro's descendant. *cough* The acting leaves much to be desired. So does the script. His Zorro costume is not what I expected. The mask is pathetic. It doesn't look like the Zorro mask most of us know it to be. The picture on the cover is misleading. You're better off watching the Disney version of Zorro starring Guy Williams. Sorry to sound so harsh, but I am sorry I wasted my money on this DVD."
5,Great Zorro movie,"Great Zorro movie!!! I've been impressed by the misture of old-western style with new technologies...using trains, aeroplanes...etc...John Carroll did a great performance!!!"
5,ZORRO DOES RIDE AGAIN - ON A GREAT DVD,Marengo Films spent a lot of time and money to restore this Serial to a pristine state. THERE IS NO FINER PRINT OF THIS SERIAL ON THE MARKET... WE GUARANTEE IT. We appreicate your business and your honest feedback.THANK YOU~~~~Marengo Films
4,"""Fresh Florida Orange Juice""","This collection of Decca hits during the late 30s, 40, and early 50s is a bit heavy on Christmas records, but satisfies that thirst for pure, smooth singing, wrapped in beautiful harmonies and elegant arrangements. Some of the arrangements here -- particularly ""Silent Night,"" and ""I'll Be Home for Christmas,"" are among the best ever done of these classics.I only wish they would put out some more of Crosby's catalogue -- it is criminally out of print.Given that formerly ""uncool"" artists such as Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, and Sammy D. have all been resurrected, along with formerly uncool pursuits such as golf, cigar-smoking and poker, isn't it time we give Der Bingle his due? I'm ready to bring back the light blue bucket hat!"
4,Bing Crosby was the man. Some of the songs are boring.,The music sample of Sweet Leilani isn't even Bing singing. He comes in later. How 'bout playing a sample of Bing?
2,only for semionova,"Polina Semionova is one of the greatest ballerinas in the world, and so this production has one thing going for it.Otherwise, it is boring and sterile, danced on a bare (and sometimes darkish) stage, with a reduced number ofswans. Inexplicably, the evil magician Rothbart is also a friend of the Prince's and is present in most of thecourt scenes as well as lakeside. The choreography is merely competent. Semionova deserves better and so do we."
5,Unique Sounds,"I meditate to very very unique sounds. Jonathan Goldman seems to deliver every single time. This man is talented, and his music and sounds allow me to enter that state of mind we all require."
1,Puzzlemania,I do not like this book at all. It was larger in size than I thought. All words are not in this book. I would not recommend this book to any puzzle lover. I wish I had returned it. This was not a good buy.
2,The New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"The prinr quality was very poor. One was worse than the other, but both are difficult to read. If I had seen how light they were printed, I would not have bought these copies. That is the disadvatange of buying on line. To some extent it is like buying a pig in a poke. Doing anything cost shipping money and you have nothing to show for it."
5,best crossword dictionary ever published,"This is a marveleous dictionary, I've found just about everyword I needed when solving crossword puzzles."
1,Completely unbelieveable,"I can't for the life of me imagine why James found Katherine in any way worthy of love. What an arrogant twit she was. The ending was completely unbelieveable - she was the cause of his losing everything else he might have held dear in his life, but it didn't matter because he loved her? I thought her responses were incredibly immature and self-centered, and I felt sorry for James for being so caught up in her. This is one of the few books I've read lately where I just intensely disliked one of the main characters, and the ending didn't resolve anything for me because I didn't believe it."
2,It could have been so good....,"This book started out great, the first half does a good job of setting up the story. The interaction between the two main characters is funny and romantic, and then it takes a turn for the terrible. At every opportunity for the characters to grow and develop along with a premise that could have been very interesting, the author plunges the characters into more hateful acts. Instead of exploring a developing relationship between two people at cross purposes, this becomes a story of a sick psychotic love obsession.In a romance novel the lovers have to be someone worth winning, not someone that you are sorry they got stuck with. In true Jane Eyre style, by the end of the book you can't stand the selfish, stuck-up, ""heroine"" who knows whats right but can't do it, and you feel so disgustingly sorry for and disappointed in the ruined ""hero"" that you put the book down feeling sick. Worse, you feel as though you wasted your time."
3,Heavens no!,"The plot of Angel Tales revolves around a boy with incredibly bad luck who one day runs into good fortune (good fortune coming in the form of live-in guardian angels). The guardian angels are more than his angels-they are his former pets come back to help him. The angels (8 so far) are all insanely possessive of him and from there arise whacky situations.As much as I wanted to enjoy this series the episodes were terribly predictable and loaded with static characters. Fans of Ranma 1/2, Love Hina or Tenchi Muyo will either love this new spin on the Harem genre or see this as a very weak imitation of better shows.Overall Angel Tales provides a few laughs but fails break new ground in an area of anime thats already over crowded. Fans of the ""harem"" genre will enjoy the comedic events but anime fans looking for something fresh will tire of the jokes. A decent filler anime to watch at a friends house but not worth spending your heard earned money."
2,airline,This airline is too stiff and it does not fit other air accessories nipples without really forcing it on with pliers
3,"Works as intended, price could be lower",Works as intended. I give it 3 stars because I believe it might be over priced for what it is. I know the mark up has to be high.
2,On the small side,"I've worked with quite a bit of aquarium tubing. This tubing is a little on the small (diameter) side which makes it difficult to get over the barb ends of many connectors. I won't buy this again, spend a bit more and get the real deal."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT,"Its great, all twenty five feet. I do wish it was a little bit softer but I guess they probably make that. Thanks"
3,Airline Tubing,"Super fast shipping, product exactly as described.This will work fine for my anodizing line for the air actuation, and seems to be stiff enough."
4,Very Useful,"Not only is it very easy to cut, the material is very strong and flexible, making it ideal for what i needed it for. However, it can kink quite easily at first so it needs to be stretched and held into the desired form for a bit to get optimal use out of it. Still, you can't go wrong with it!"
4,Decent Tubing,"For the price, you can't beat it. But I have to agree with the other reviewer that I do not believe this is aquarium tubing. It is a little too flexible, which can cause it to kink. This can be easily fixed by having a little extra tube by the fittings.But aside from that, it works just fine. I have a 30 gallon tank and used maybe a third of it. Holds air and fits well around the fittings."
4,Good Tubing,Cheap good tubing. No problems with it. It took a few days to ship after I purchase but it came quickly after that. It is a good buy.
4,Excellent account of a brilliant CW general,Most people think only of Custers last stand at the Little Big Horn. Not many realize that Custer was a brilliant CW general. Dr Urwin corrects this historical oversite wonderfully.
5,The Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer,It is unbelievable what we know little of the man. That we are all influenced by the unlimitless stories of Custer's Last Stand.It is truly an injustice to not know how many battles in the American Civil War hinged on George Armstrong Custer's valiantry.This book is a must reading for any Civil War and Custer readers.
3,one sided,"this book is valuable as a reference to Custer's Civil War service. At least you will learn in which battles he participated. Whether or not he was the brave hero portrayed is questionable simply because this author is so in love with Custer that everything else is disregarded.Urwin was only 24 years old when he wrote this book, and it shows. It's almost adolescent in its praise of Custer. He denigrates everyone who criticized Custer during his 7th Cav days. The enlisted men were ""trash"", the officers ""petty and jealous"". This is a book written by a young man with a lot to learn."
3,"It's OK , but...","...you can find better renditions of Kohntarkosz,Hhai and MDK.-That version of Kohntarkosz is pretty good , but I recommend the one found on ""live at Reims 1976"" , where the violin solo is replaced by A KILLER MINI-MOOG SOLO by Benot Widemann-The versions of Hhai found on ""Retrospektiw 3"" and ""live at Bobino 1981"" both have a very jazzy and exciting ""question-answer"" solo by Widemann and Jean-Luc Chevalier-What we have here is an abriged MDK , which to me sounds rather boring (unless you listen to it in a dark room ,lying sprawled out on a sofa,with incense sticks burning...)I think the good surprises of the record are the tracks Kobaia (very groovy) and Emehnteht-re (very bewitching)After all,that live album demonstrates how the Argesdrah could be powerful,reflective and self-confident(violonist Lockwood was only 17 ! ) on stage .That's far enough to be outstanding.IEGAH"
1,"This is not music. Mahavishnu is, but this here is not.","I have bought this CD, paying a lot of money to get it, being influenced by the 5 stars amazon.com reviews, but it turned out to be a huge mistake I have made. I am a big listener of John Mahavishnu's recordings (I own the best of them, from IMF to VOEB) and I consider that there is no possible comparision that can be made with Magma. Mahavishnu is a milestone in the 20th century music, while Magma is only a boring, a very boring, 100 % not musically band. No history. No one would remember anything about them. No wonder it is a french band. They should do what they do best and leave the progressive rock and the jazz-rock fusion for the anglo-saxon world. No ofense."
5,Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi,"Hi, my name is Omar, I'm 15 years old, I'm from Mexico and I think these japanese girls are very cool and cute!, I love all of their songs, but my favorites are Sayonara and Puffy de Rumba (I think these are very beautiful songs) Puffy's Rule is a very cool song, Stray Cats Fever and Image Down too, Choo Choo Train is a very good song too, Love so Pure and Your Love is a Drug ""me dejaron impresionado"" because they're very beautiful and good songs, Joining a Fan Club is great, Toku Suru Karada, Ai no Shirushi, Nehorina Hahorina or ""Neholina"", K2G, Planet Tokyo, Umi Heto, True Asia, mmm... why I am saying all the songs that I love? I love all the songs of Puffy AmiYumi!!! I'm a big super fan of these japanese girls!!! ""mis respetos para estas chicas japonesas"", OK, I think I talked so much, I'm sorry...!VIVA MÉXICO Y VIVA JAPÓN!"
4,Awesome start!!!,"This is my first introduction to PuffyAmiYumi, and I loved it! I enjoyed all of the songs (especially the japanese ones), but I only gave the album 4 stars because I know Puffy has better songs out there. But! Being their first escapade into America, this was awesome.My Fav Songs:V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N - A beachy sounding song, in which Yumi Yoshimura sings about all the things she will need on her vacation. From PuffyAmiYumi's SoloSolo.True Asia: A hit song by the duo in which they sing of their love for all things Asia....and of course Teen Titans! If you are like me you probably heard of PuffyAmiYumi first on their music video on Cartoon Network for the hit show, Teen Titans.Perfect for all ages, especially those who need a little ""happy fun rock band cartoon explosion""!!Hi hi!!"
5,I love puffy,If want to listen to something that will cheer me up i turn to this album. The songs are upbeat and catchy and I love all the tracks. I'm sad I missed their tour this summer but never fear all you otaku's who missed it and missed their panel at otakon they apologized and said next time they won't schedule a tour during otakon.
2,Sophomoric,"If you liked Kaptain Kopter and the Twirlybirds, you might like this album a lot more than I did.But, if you are considering purchasing this album because you can't get enough of Spirit, I would recommend that you buy all of the Spirit albums, everything by Jay Ferguson, the Spirit reunion album, and everything by Jo Jo Gunne before descending into Kaptain Kopter.The Good: There are a few cuts that are somewhat musical, and there is a very nice version of ""Nature's Way.""The Bad: There are a lot of tedious, unfunny, unmusical, tracks on the album. Most of it sounds like a troupe of untalented high school sophomores trying to mash up Monty Python, Firesign Theater, and the Mothers of Invention.It doesn't work."
2,Extremely weak compared to other ultimate collections,"Psycho Legacy is extremley weak when compared to other Ultimate Collections like Friday the 13th or Halloween. There is no tour of the Bates Mansion or Hotel, just a walk by. The audio is poor on most of the DVD. I loved the Psycho movies but I'm so glad I didn't buy this. Check it out at your local library. You'll be glad you did."
3,No Psycho remake or Bates Motel?,"Not a bad documentary and extras package but it's not as thorough as it really should have been. For example, there's no coverage of the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho. Regardless of whether it was any good or not, it should have at least rated a mention. Also, there's no information about the failed tv pilot for Bates Motel which has only ever appeared on VHS as far as I know, and starred Bud Cort as an ex-mental patient who inherited the house and hotel from Norman. Like the Psycho remake this was also terrible but if you're going to make a documentary called The Psycho Legacy, it seems weird to leave out these two curios."
3,This is not Greg Ginn,"Warning! This is NOT Greg Ginn from Black Flag, anything by a band of the same name on the Pink Honey label in Amazon is a different group. (Greg Ginn's material is issued on his own record label; SST)"
5,"The first, the best.","Italians are proud to have a band like Banco, is a band who have the power in the words of the singer, I don't know how a man who don't understand italian can apreciate this album, for me is one of the best rock progressive album of all time, but....... this is my opinion!"
5,"This is my ""No-fail"" cookbook","I'm not much of a cook, but this is my all time favorite cookbook. I have never made a meal from this book that didn't turn out really well. Even a beginner can be successful with this cookbook. I especially like the fact that the recipes call for mostly fresh ingredients as opposed to canned items."
5,Insightful and funny,"When I first heard about this dvd, I was a little skeptical. I am a Star Trek fan, but knowing William Shatner's historical bios, I wasn't sure how well I would like it. I finally broke down and bought it. When my wife and I watched it, we loved it. We found it very insightful as it looked at the impact that Star Trek has had on our culture, and Shatner made it funny at times. Great dvd!!"
1,A most awful piece of drivel,"This is really too bad for words. What were those people thinking? It was not funny, just embarrassing! I only gave it one star because no lower rating was available. It really deserves a minus ten!Don't waste your money on this!!!"
5,SURPRISINGLY WONDERFUL,I heard exerpts from this CD on a radio station and was pleasantly surprised at Tony Danza's talent. He ranks right up there with Frank Sinatra. I just love the music from the swing era and Tony Danza brings it back to life with perfection. You won't believe his voice! It is beautiful. What talent!! And his 9 year old daughter joins him for a touching duet. You must get this CD!
3,Valiant try. He really needs to loosen up.,"I appreciate Danza's first effort at recording. I just wish he didn't take himself too seriously. Most crooners wait for their fourth or fifth album to include children vocals, but not ol' Tony. Just imagine the kid from ""Bless the Beasts and the Children"" from The Carpenters, and you begin to cringe. Not one, but two kid vocal songs. Good luck with the talk show, Tony. I'm waiting for you to do a mash with Danzig!"
1,Act now...pugalist sings da blues!,"It kind of sounds like Rocky Balboa trying to sound like Sinatra. With all the deese,dem's and dose's who can understand what this guy is singing. Word of advise Tony Micelli...stick wit da actin and da boxin!"
1,I have the singing talents of a buzzard taint,I'll just go back to my worthless show with my fat fans
5,Not only handsome but romantic!,"LOVE this cd! i was intrigued when i learned of its existence, as i had no idea that Tony Danza sang! The reviews were only so-so, but i wanted to hear it for myself. Smart move. This cd is delightful -- just like Tony himself! Quite romantic and fun! His voice is incredible! He sings as well as he acts -- if not even better! And i adore his acting! i highly recommend this cd and only wish he had done others! i can't believe he didn't. He's a natural. i felt woo-ed from the beginning! (-8 To me, he's an Italian Harry Connick, Jr -- and i don't think you can get any better than that! i swoon just at the thought! And the songs he chose were so much fun! i especially loved that he included his daughter who was just a little girl at the time on the cd with him. It said much about him as a person. i feel this cd is a winner on all counts!"
4,Small Lightweight Quick Release Mounting Plate,This mounting plate is smaller and lighter than the more ubiquitous Manfrotto RC2 plate. It works with the 718 tripod but is made of metal rather than the plastic mounting plate that is supplied with that tripod. Manfrotto also offers a mounting base mounting plate combo that includes this mounting plate and the architectural mounting plate which can be used to adapt a tripod that has no quick release system.It works as advertized but I would feel more confidence in the larger RC2 system especially given that systems' safety latch provide extra protection against inadvertently dropping the camera.
3,The intricate world of Colette,"This book describes Colettes daily life in a cottage in a rural setting on the Mediterranean cost of Provence in Southern France, in the city of Saint Tropez. Besides Colette, two other characters strikes out in the account: Viale, a young painter and Hélène Clément, an young woman. Colette, which is an older woman, has a relationship with Vial, and Hélène Clément is too in love with Vial. So this ménage à trois provides an unspoken tension which in an indirect manner fuels the account. The style of the book is in the form of a poetic diary. Colette seems to be a somewhat lonely figure whose closest relations seems to be with the cats which lives together with her in her house. Also she seems very attached to nature which she describes with sensuous sensitivity."
2,save your green from this yellow...,"save your money. you are better off buying another yellowman cd this one is not 20 hits--more like 4 hits and 16 lame songs.Yellowman is a great dj/toaster and his band is great--but this cd--skip it, I urge you to check out other Yellowman cd's."
2,"Light, infrequent use only","For a weekend repair job this saw works fairly well. Make a few practice cuts before trying to make a precise cut. The tracking guide notches are not accurate! I would also suggest buying a spare blade. The factory blade will not last very long before it becomes too dull to cut cardboard. I managed only 15 2X4 cuts before it went bad.The good: Decent price, light weight, decent power cord length.The Bad: Tin foil blade, dreadful guide.If you use a Circular saw very often, then buy something else.If you are not experienced with this type of tool, you might become seriously pissed at the guide."
4,functional,"It's underwear. For the price, its a value and the fit is fine. Don't see a need to spend big dollars on a pair that gets stained."
4,Fruit of the Loom Men's Boxer Briefs,"I always like this product, but for me it has one problem with the sizing, in other products large size it between 36-38, I thought is the right one. also I recommended. the Price is Good."
5,Most comfortable Boxer Briefs,"Great material, soft, comfortable. Briefs that at last are large enough, For those who don't like the new body-thight fashion."
5,briefs,My husband just loves these briefs. He switched over from jockeys and just loves the comfort!!
3,Too big and too thin,"Ordered these pants size XXL. Pants came to size 2XL. As I understand it, the size of 2XL is designed for obese men and in those shorts, I like in the bag. Material thin. I must say, briefs could be better and smaller."
4,At long last...,"Jai, we really love you and the Pagans, but also desperately need your incredible, unique, pure Kirtan. Thanks for sharing your heart practice with us in this way. More please!!! Radha Ramana Hari Bol, Om Namah Shivaya and Bhajarangi defy description. Worth owning just for the artwork. Also awaiting your new Pagan album with great anticipation."
3,It's growing on me,"There are some strong kirtans here with a lot of emotion that really involves the listener. I enjoy singing along with some, while others are more complex but flow and are interesting and easy to listen to. I prefer the 'traditional' arrangements and think the remixes distracted from an otherwise excellent CD. However, the more I listen to the CD the more I'm begining to tolerate the remixes. Overall I'm glad that I purchased the CD."
4,reference volume on The Early South,"A really valid portrait of the South that has escaped many reviewers; if one is looking for a colorful, accurate evaluation of the mindset that permeated the ""class"" society and the driving economic power that human bondage ensured, a must read. Prof. Eaton is a marvelous writer for historians and for the general public."
2,Cracker Wants A Poly,The description of this article says it is a 80/20 Cotton/Poly blend. It's not. It's tagged with 100% cotton.
4,A Treat For Teagarden Fans,"This fine concert from November 1947 will especially please Jack Teagarden fans, and also will convert the rest of you. T. sings and plays superbly on ""Stars Fell On Alabama"", making it easy to see why it came to be identified with him. He also sings and plays a very energetic trombone on ""Baby, Won't You Please Come Home"". Listen for the stunning cadenza at the end of the song. ""Lover"" also features Jack.The other members of the All Stars also excel here. Listen with joy to Barney Bigard's almost otherworldly clarinet on the intro and outro to ""Body and Soul"". I love many versions of this song, one of the most beautiful of all standards, but this is one of my favorites.Mr. Armstrong, as usual astonishes, and his performances, vocally and instrumentally, include many sublime moments, none of which are lost on the crowd. Oh, to have been there!The sound quality here is good overall, and better than on the famous Town Hall concert six months earlier."
5,Sinbad is BACK !,"This DVD is well worth the money. He had me in stitches...laughing so hard, I was crying."
5,Hysterically Funny,I have always enjoyed Sinbad as he is the kind of comedian who delivers good clean humor but can keep you laughing. Having not heard about him for years I was very happy to purchase this DVD. He had my boyfriend and I in stitches as we are both of that age (over 50) and clearly understood the type of humor that comes with long-term relationships in that age category..
2,Not as family friendly as what was on cable....,"Either I overlooked it, or it wasn't there....but what I recieved was a ""unrated"" version that had sexually suggestive material regarding husbands & wives that was not there when this came on cable. Not what I would suggest for personal viewing or to have Christian friends over. Saddened by that. I usually enjoy Sinbad's clean comedy. Maybe because this came out through comedy central that Sinbad felt he needed to push the envelope to re-enter the spotlight. For those with the same concerns, take note."
2,Sinbad: Where U Been?,"I was disappointed in this particular performance by Sinbad that I had hoped to share with my high school students. Based on Sinbad's various interviews in the past I believed his material stayed above the crass and the lewd. I purchased this well reviewed performance and was surprised at the amount of adult sexually based humor that made up this performance. I knew I was in trouble when the Advisory appeared at the beginning of the DVD. So, teachers, if you're looking for a wholesome stand up contemporary comic DVD, this will not be it. All others: enjoy!"
4,Love Sinbad,"As always Sinbad delivered a great show. The man has skills and is able to maintain the funny without a lot of foul language. He is a just a great comedian. I liked 95% of the show ... And for those of you who are not an Obama fan he only spoke about him for 5-10 minutes max and I have to admit what he said was funny!!!!!! I've watched this video at least 4-5 times already. The only part I did not like was the musical part in the end ... I just didn't think it was something for a mixed crowd such as he had...and I am not into that kind of music, which is why I gave the show a 4 star and not a 5 star. It is great for young, in between and just the young at heart :-)!!!!"
5,Hilarious!!!!,I purchased Sinbads' latest stand-up because I caught the tail end of it on Cable. Not disappointed at all. He is back and better than ever.
4,"There You Are, Sinbad!","It had been a while since hearing Sinbad in the stand-up format. It was hilarious and great to see him back. I was surprised some of the subject matter, but it was still very funny. A great look at growing older and dealing with marriage and family issues."
5,Sinbad Where U Been?,"I was so excited to find this dvd on your site, we love watching sinbad and have all his standup dvds, haven't seen him in a while so this dvd was really good.. Thank you Aurora"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This one was another big disappointment from Sinbad! Again I can't believe he actually put this out! He has some good ones, but I can't figure out how some of them are so bad."
1,Piece of Junk,I am so diaapointed in this toy its unreal. I recvd it as a gift for my sons 1st birthday and held it for the past two years until he turned three ( as the reccomended age is 3+) I finally let him have it today and boy we were both disappointed. It took ages to even try and snap together the cheap plastic pieces and when it seemmed like i finally had it ( and had my 3 yr old clapping for me) its fell apart on the very first try. I was then unable to put it back together again. I am going ot try and take it back to toys r us but as i dont have a receipt at all ill see what happens.
2,Could be loads of fun but. . .,"My son loves the truck and talking garage from this set so I could never return it. However, the pieces for the ramp will not snap together so it is impossible to play with that part. It would be a great toy if they put a little more time into its design. I thought at first perhaps mine was defective but after looking into other reviews it looks as if it is a poorly made toy. I think it is a great idea, the colors are wonderful and fun, the talking garage makes my two year old laugh and laugh but I cannot reccomend it to others since it is impossible to play with the entire playset. It is surprising coming from Tonka who I trusted to be more durable."
1,a dud,"don't bother with this toy. it does not stay together long enough for play. because we bought it at full price, we gave it a good go, but just couldn't get anything to work or stay together. toysrus was wonderful to exchange it for us!"
2,"What a piece of Junk! Can this be ""TONKA""?","Please...save yourself the money and DO NOT purchase this toy. It looks really cool, but within minutes of assembly it will fall apart and leave you with a fussy, frustrated child. Since my husband usually does the ""assembly"" work on our son's toys, I figured I did something wrong putting it together...NOPE...It is just that cheaply made. Too bad. My son likes the idea of it. I have reassembled this toy a dozen times in a few hours and I am ready to return it! The model I bought is actually the Police Station version and it sounds like they all have the same issues."
4,needs a little improvement,"This toy doesnt really stay together. I have been constantly reassembling it. another reviewer was correct that you need a tiny screwdriver to put in the batteries and requires almost a whole package of AA's. You need to use this on a table or for some reason the truck doesnt go back into the garage properly and cant get out either. Also, my 4 yr old had a tendency to move the truck even though it moves my itself and to hold down the garage door when it closes by itself so maybe it needs to be for children a little older. You also need a pretty open space to use it or the truck will drive itself off the table or keep bumping into you. I think my son would have more fun playing with it if he could move the truck himself , because i have to keep telling him to stop touching it because it moves by itself (what fun is it just to watch??)"
3,Ripped ...,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son who loves to play with trucks. I put it together with minimal effort. However, every time my son trys to lift the loader with the boulders in it or dumps them down the shute he has to hold the main frame down with his other hand because it does not work smoothly. If he uses too much force or moves it from one location to the next the legs fall off and the whole thing comes apart. The garage part of it is very hard to understand. The voice box is very muffled. There is also no shut off button for the garage, so as long as the truck is within a certain radius of the garage the thing keeps talking long after play with my child has stopped. At the price ... plus 7 batteries to get it all to work, I feel this product was highly over priced and I got ripped off. This toy will be in the attic (or trash) very soon due to the frustration my child gets from it falling apart every time he tries to play with it."
4,Good fun,"I got this to help fill a few days of just my own company - I haven't tried it couples-style. At least, not yet.These stories are the kind I like: reasonably literate, very explicit, and basically about people being happy with each other. The stories don't rush into the physical coupling - they always give a few pages to set their scenes end engage the imagination. There's no [almost] sub/dom theme here. Almost all of the stories are affectionate and mutual. That suits my tastes just fine, and doesn't interfere a bit with a juicy story. Quite the opposite, it encourages unhurried, detailed descriptions of the players and their play.These stories really are what erotica should be. The stories are brief but fulfilling, come across without the dark edge that puts people off. By yourself or in company, Enjoy!"
3,"We are VERY open minded, BUT......","This book just did not do it for us. We purchased this book (and Sweet Life: Erotic Fantasies for Couples 2) based on the reviews from other couples and women. We were sorely disappointed. But maybe our type of fantasies are different from others. Male-Male Bisexuality and enemas do not fit our view point of erotic fantasies.However, based on the writing style, the stories are well written. We gave this 3 stars because the fantasies are just not our type, but the writing style is VERY well done.Just not for us."
2,Boring.,"Mediocre at best. this is one of the only erotic books i've read but this one is so bland. Is sex writing supposed to be this dull? Nothing turned me on. I like the story by Emilie Paris the best. I guess there a few good one's, I liked 3 out of the 20 or so. Most were just dull."
4,Too many butts,"Although this book was interesting, and at times very sexy, it really seemed to rotate around a lot of butt themes. :-) Which would be good except I'm not into butts, spankings, and really several people getting into it. If that is your thing, you'll love this book!"
1,depends on what you are looking for,"This book is great if you are into overly stereotyped gender roles, and female (...) sex.If you are into female dominance...there is only one story in here for you, & it's pretty basic. Lots of multiple partner stories if you're into that.most of the stories were on the boring side. lots of sentimental tidbits. If you like only reading about sexual fantasies this book could be fun. If you are looking for new ideas to spice up your love life...don't waist your time or money."
5,Fantasy Exploration,"Very hot stories and full of great ideas for exploring new frontiers in sexual play with a partner. The fantasies are sexy, realistic and charged with erotic energy. These couples take charge and turn their fantasies into reality."
1,Wish I'd have listened to the other reviewers....,"....who said the stories are boring. I'm not hard-core or anything but these stories were completely lame. Even ""My Secret Garden"" has better, more interesting content than 90% of these. Only one or two of them held my attention AT ALL, past the first page."
4,Steel guitar like you've never heard,"You dug THE WORD... Think Robert Randolph is the KING? Come to our electric church and find out where the magic REALLY comes from. Curated by John Medeski, this album features the greatest sacred steel guitar players in the world on seventeen glorious tracks."
4,"Super Music, Cracked Case",This album has an extensive sampling of Leroy Anderson's music. Lots of great songs! My only complaint is that the CD case came cracked such that the cover falls off every time I open it -- not a huge deal but certainly annoying.
3,"What do you do, dear?","Not as clever as ""What do you say dear?"" I'm not sure that children can get the humor. Although, the idea of what good manners are is there. ON the other hand,""What do you say dear?"",is really funny and a child can get the idea. I loved this book and rccomend it."
2,Close your eyes and drift away.......,"as buying this album will provide you with a piece of music, getting you into a gloomy and sensual mood after a hot day spent on the beach. Truly awesome! After heard Nude Dimensions vol. 2, which is a more upbeat album, I really thought the Naked Music record label could impossibly outbeat themselves from a quality and beauty perspective. Well......they did!!"
4,You'll want more Tonic!,"This isn't the first time Tonic has treated fans with something unique and extra when you purchase an album. They often have extra cuts, screensavers, or some kind of surprise with their releases. This is also the case with the ""You Wanted More/Sugar"" CD now available. The surprise? The exclusive acoustic version of ""You Wanted More."" It's very tastefully done and quite passionate. You can't go wrong if you like Tonic and buy this CD, with their hits ""Open Up Your Eyes,"" and ""If You Could Only See."" Tonic is currently on tour, and this CD is the perfect preview to a show that may be coming near you. ""You Wanted More/Sugar"" is simply the Best Of Tonic, at a great low price!"
5,Great Cat Toy,"At first my cat had to get used to it being larger than others, but now he seems to prefer the larger puff balls to play with. He can carry it in his mouth and it doesn't get caught under as much furniture as smaller ones."
5,sometimes simple is best,"These little fuzzy balls have been the favorite of every kitten I've had. Recently, I rescued a very bright little guy, who is actually smart enough to chase the balls down the stairs and then carry them back up in his mouth to do it again. The fact that the balls are very soft and comfortable to carry between the teeth makes them very much loved by cats."
2,Gangsta not at his best,"I like Gangsta as an artist and a person. He's got a classic OG style that I can relate to (i.e. hittin switches three wheeling and cap peeling). But this album is missing just that. It's on the verge of being on that commercial style where a lot of cat's is going now to try to get paid. I aint haten on nobody that's trying to make some ""mail"", but at the same time you disappoint the true fans. I hope Gangsta's next album is more like his old style. If you wanna compare, go and cop the ""Comrads"" 1st album, ""Bad Azz"" album titled ""Word On The Street"" and listen to ""Addicted To Crime""(track 10), and if you can find his first solo album titled ""Wanted"" you'll definetly will see what I'm talkin 'bout."
5,A Whimsical Winner!,Both of my children (ages 3 and 7) love this book! My 3 year-old loves the rhyming words and brightly-colored illustrations. My seven year-old loves to read it to her sister and listen to the giggles it evokes. Bravo!
4,Beautiful,"Although Tarja's voice was toned down a lot in this album, Nightwish, as a whole has progressed far enough that they have created a very powerful and unique album. I don't have any major gripes with the album. All the songs are great by themselves and work even better when listened to together (one after another).Kuolema tekee taiteilijan is the only song that I feel doesn't deliver as good as it could have. Even though I feel this, the song is beautiful alone because of Tarja's voice.Anywho, if you like Nightwish, I'm sure you'll find something you like on this album."
2,2 1/2 stars,I heard Ghost Love Score first- and just like everyone else--thought it was a really cool song. So i bought it--and found it was the only real decent song on the album--a couple others come close--but overall its just blah- and boring sound effects! SAVE YOUR MONEY
5,Nightwish rocks!!,"You just gotta love Nightwish. Once is a true breathtaking gothic metal masterpiece. Tarja Turunen has got in my opinion one of the most beautiful singing voices ever along with Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil). Nemo, Wish I Had An Angel, Dark Chest Of Wonders, Creek Mary's Blood, The Siren, Planet Hell, Romanticide, and Ghost Love Score are my favorite songs on here. A must have for fans of gothic metal or metal in general. Long Live Nightwish."
3,What Happened?,"I've been a fan of Nightwish for the last 2 years (being in the US, the only way you listen to them is via MP3's or if you grab the CD yourself since radios do not -ever- play them since they just have no following) and this CD is a bit dissapointing compared to others. Now yes, the guitars are more used in this one than the others, and they've got a theme to it which is different than the others. She sings differently during most of this CD; she's using more higher pitch and singing a little softer. The music itself is a bit darker/harder than the others (personal opinion only, don't quote me on it :) )Those are the main differences between this CD and others. I do like ""Planet Hell"" and ""Nemo"" for their own things, however on the whole, its just another Nightwish album. Avid fans may enjoy it just for being what it is (my husband included), but its no Wishmaster."
5,One of the best goth metal albums ever deserves to have the breakout success Evanescence had,If you're tired of turning on the radio and hearing some British guy endlessly whining Beautiful maybe it's time to discover something different like Nightwish the best rock/opera group in the world.Nightwish has been making terrific music for years but Once is their best album to date.Combining Tarja Tarunen's strong vocals with heavy matal music and choirs and contrasting her voice with Marco Hietala's harsher vocals every song is an dramatic experience.It's pointless to analalyze each song you just have to experience it for yourself!If I had to pick a favorite song though it would be the thrilling Wish I Had An Angel.If you have even the slightest interest in Goth music Once is a musical epic that belongs in your collection.
1,BLAH,I heard ghost love score and was hooked-now im tired of that song cause its the only good track on the album- agree with other negative reviews- STAY CLEAR- trust me!!!
2,The songs are Stupid.,"I agree with the last review. This is a goodish album but the lyrics are stupid. I'd actually be embarrassed if I were to be playing this to somebody and they asked me what the song(s) were about. If Nightwish could put together some sensible chorus lines to their tracks, then they would most probably have more appeal."
1,Shame 1 Star is the lowest,This album is 1 of the worst records of the decade. Ignore the ramblings by the '5' star reviewers. They don't know what they are talking about cause they are stupid. I can some up Nightwish in 1 word - CRAP.
1,What total and utter crap!,"Nightwish can't write, can't sing, sound pathetic and are total and utter crap."
1,This makes a really good 'Frisbe'.,"Heard it all before. Opera and Metal, yawn yawn yawn. You'd think some of these reviewers had just been born.... This album is crap. Luckily we needed a new frisbe, so thank you Nightwish."
1,NO STARS,"Superbly written? More like superbly ripped off from elsewhere. This isn't a beautiful album at all but a horrible album to listen. Proms type outtakes with a heavy guitar riff and out of key vocals sounds crap in my mind. In fact Nightwish are one of the worst bands I've ever heard. Kids will love em though, and from reading most of these reviews, I doubt there are many reviewers over 13 years old that are praising this band. Except of course the Finnish loyal."
1,Once is a big Number '2',"I don't know what this reviewers is on, but to describe this album as the best thing going is very naive. Nightwish are probably one of the worst metal bands ever. Their music sucks, pure and simple. This album and infact all their albums are simply terrible. So ignore all these daft 5 star reviews and save some money. Nightwish suck! suck! suck!"
1,Stop this madness!,"Are all of you serious? This is HORRIBLE.Orchestra, mixed with a feeble attempt at metal, with the worst singing I have ever heard.Finland must stop the export of all it's music to the outside world."
1,Another poor attempt,"Nightwish have once again failed to progress. In a desperate attempt to capture Metal and Opera they have failed terribly. An earlier review said that 'Once' was like an adventure, yet I would have to be high as kite to agree with this becuase the adventure would only go as far as my trash can. The singing is out of key. The guitars are toned down too far and mixed with silly synthesiser sound effects makes the whole charade give you earache. I would much prefer to be tortured with electrodes then put my music system through this again. However, there is one good thing to say about the album 'Once', it makes a dam good 'frisby'. So Nightwish, go back to Europe and die."
1,Worst album of the decade,"Why do kids love this band so much? I have had to listen to my 13 year Niece play this album over and over again for the last 3 hours and in buying headphones for her, its the best money spent this year, as for this annoying band, as far as rock goes it is such a pile of crap and I just hope that eventually she will grow out of it."
5,Truley Epic rock,"I only new vaguely of Nightwish until one of my friends turned me on to it, and after listening to this album, I think I have a new favorite band.A few of the songs are a bit harsh (I don't like screaming, so sue me), but others are downright haunting. My favorite track is ""Ghost Love Score"" which makes full use of the band's orchestral resources and is one of the most beautiful and epic pieces of music I have ever heard.""Once"" manages to provide a broad spectrum of sound, and all of it is of superb quality."
5,Spectacular,"Nightwish hits hard with this album. Although it isn't another Century Child, it is a great album and well worth the listen."
1,Crap album from a crap band,"Who are these people? If this album was so good why isn't this band on the television? This album sucks! 3 people who I know that have heard this album agree. The people that are writing these reviews are just trying to sucker people into buying this record, which is an abuse of the Amazon review system. Before anybody considers buying this and parting with their hard earned cash, download a few MP3's. Then you can decide. I personally think this is a biggest piece of 'metal garbage' going."
1,The title is right.,"You can only listen to this piece of trash once. Then it's straight in the trash can. Total and utter crap. The singing is dia, the songs are stupid and the backing music is unoriginal. Uninspiring, dull, painful and depressing. Don't waste your money!"
3,Very confusing reviews on this,"Half the reviewers love this, half seem to hate it.Whatever, does it really matter? This music will not appeal to everybody, but if you want to listen to some fast, tight Neo-classical based rock, Nightwish will be up your street. They also make a change from all the Hip-Hop metal trash that's out there at the moment."
1,Nightwish fail to progress,I am dissappointed with this album. It sounds the same as their previous releases and the whole charade of symphonic metal is getting tedious and boring.
5,I was very impressed with this CD,I think the first 3 songs on this CD are some of Nightwishes best work. I was very impressed with this CD in general.
5,BEST ALBUM IN YEARS!!!!,I am in LOVE I mean IN LOVE with Nightwish! they are at the top of my favorite bands with Evanescence!( They ties that's how good they are!) I think this is one of the best albums I've heard in YEARS! (next to Fallen by Evanescence). I have all the Nightwish albums and I think this is the best one yet!! I love the way it sounds! I got the 1st version from Finland and I got this one today (just because it had more tracks!!) Nightwish it by far one of the BEST bands around! The lead singer (Tarja Turunen) is one of the best singers I have ever herd! I just wish they hit it big in the US I don't see why they don't. So buy this album you wont disappointed!!!
4,sweet as a whole/hole,"i wouldn't had bet on this new nightwish release but put aside Tuomas childish epic universe -> you have a solid album here. I use to think emppu's guitar work sucked (in this one he kind of suprised me).Jukka's drumming is not present (this guy got infinite talent!USE IT!).Tarja your pretty:(I want you bad ;0).Overall,Nightwish's sweatest oeuvre.They can be recognized as musicians."
3,Metal meets Mantovani . . .,"or Musak (please mentally insert little ""circle R"" thingy here). Or ""The Ten Thousand Strings of Baden-Baden Play Slayer.""Further demonstration of the thesis that, for every tacky pop mega-hit in America, there's something just as popular in Europe that's at least as trashy.This album gets as much as three stars because it has a certain novelty appeal, and because (as somebody sometime said about something else) it might be okay after about six beers."
1,SOMETHING TO BUY,"This is one of those if your a collector like me you just have to purchase it to make the collection complete. I've been listening to Nightwish since Wishmater and fell in love with them. I have all their cd's. This is probly the most annoying cd that I have of them. I have all their cd's and most of their singles and I just can't listen to this thing except for a couple of songs. NEMO, I WISH I HAD AN ANGEL and PLANET HELL that's it. It was and is a pleasure to see them come to the states, I have seen them 3 times, ATLANTA, CHICAGO AND MINNEAPOLIS. Great shows, great songs, but awful new album. Please, I beg you please, to go back to Century Media you released some great albums with them and when you reunite with them, you'll release your greatest album('s) ever. On your next CD, have a duet with Tarja and Marcus."
1,Once is too much!,"What a naff album by a naff band! Silly operative overtures with grunge guitar, bleedin awful vocals and stupid lyrics. I hate this band, they do nothing for me. In fact I'm embarrased to play any of their music!!!"
4,very good,"Ok,i have a problem with a couple of the reviews.First of all ""david bowie"" i'm not sure what part of the world you're from and i don't have any kids but if i did and they had at least half the good taste to be listening to this,I would be rather proud.Where i'm from(the U.S.A.) most 13 year old's are listening to some force fed pop junk like britney spears or even worse some awful rap stuff.If you are the REAL david bowie all i have to say is at a very young age mtv shoved your awful ""lets dance"" video down my throat every 2 hours......."
5,The Most Beautiful CD of 2004,"Once is the best CD so far this year. Once is a beautiful CD. The ballads are so melodic you can play if for your mother. Yet it has enough rockin', head tossin' music to make your kid want to hear it The mix is fantastic. The bass is so deep, the ambient sounds make you feel like you are there. And the voices are amazaing. Tarja is a magnificent, beautiful, sexy angel. She is here to show us what a real vocalist can do. If you have never heard Nightwish, this is an excellent CD to start with."
4,I like...,"Nightwish is one of my favourite bands and I've enjoyed pretty much every album. This one is no exception. I first saw the video for ""Nemo"" and then finally got the album. Most of the tracks are rather... meh... ok. But I really enjoy ""Wish I Had An Angel"" and ""Ghost Love Score"". I gave it 4 stars... because I like it a lot, but as I previously noted... some of the songs are just mediocre or not really that great. I'd recommend Century Child first if you are just now discovering them."
3,May not be for everyone.,"I have always been a nightwish fan, owning all of their Cd's so far. But sadly you just may find yourself listening to 1/2 the songs on this CD Once...the name suggests. Dark Chest of wonders, Nemo, planet hell and The siren are pretty good songs, but the rest seem to fall short of Nightwish's awesome albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century child. Some problems I found - Jukka's druming which has been awesome on previous albums is almost not there =/. And at times it seems like there too much ochestra at times. Emppu's guitar work on some songs seems like the bare basics =?. Some of the songs seem to lack that nightwish flow and feel that has been seen on their other albums. If you are new to nightwish, i'd recommend starting with OceanBorn, wishmaster & Century child."
4,"Pretty good, but not as great as some","I am a big Nightwish fan, and I must say I like this disc very much. Why then did I rate this disc a little low? Because, unlike several of their other discs, this one's songs were ""hit or miss."" I really liked, ""Dark Chest of Wonders,"" ""Wish I had an Angel,"" ""Creek Mary's Blood,"" ""Ghost Love Score,"" and ""Live to Tell the Tale."" Unfortunately, the other songs pale in comparison. I have other (Nightwish) discs where there's maybe one song I don't care for. All-in-all though, it's worth buying!"
3,GREAT album with serious FLAWS...,"When it's on, it's masterful, explosive, haunting and well executed. It can truly be brilliant. But....When it's off? Trite, silly, overdone, repetitive and grating.Unless you are a true fan of this style of music, you will find yourself skipping about half the tracks on the CD. You will also find yourself turning it up for the other half.It's worth a buy, even with the bad tracks.(Imagine this album as a fusion of Evanescence, Megadeth, The London Philharmonic Orchestra and a Lord of the Rings Soundtrack.)"
5,"Fantastic, One of Nightwish's Best!","If you like symphonic metal, this is a MUST HAVE! One of the best albums I've ever bought. Their previous album, Century Child is another all time favorite, I recommend it too!"
4,Good stuff,"Heard of this band from a friend and it really grew on me. Great vocals, and melodic guitar licks."
5,Fantastic !,"It's an amazing sound. The 2 bonus tracks is so cool, the videoclip (Wish I had an angel) is very good too. Is impressive the power and the smoothness of their music. Highly recommended !"
2,Heard it all before,The production of this is good but the contents lacks anything new. Some of the tracks sound absolutely awful. I am surprised this album has so many good reviews. It does nothing for me.
2,Gets boring quickly,"I too am disappointed with this record. I liked the first listen, but then I quickly started skipping tracks and now I don't play it at all because it's boring. There's too much overlapping in it, one minutes it's metal, next minute it's poppy."
2,Symphonic Boredom,"Why so many reviews? a rave review seems to be followed by a crap one over and over again. Everyone to their own, but there is definately some massive differences of opinion on this album. To some it is simply fantastic or trash. I'll go down the middle, It isn't as good as some people are making out."
5,GREAT CD,"I don't understand why there are some reviews talking so bad about the band and the album, by someone who doesn't identify (chickens?)... by the way, if you like nightwish you will love the album, it is my favourite along with oceanborn. it has an heavier guitar sound, excellent melodies, it's great, believe me it is awesome!!!"
2,Nothing mind blowing,"Some of the reviews on this record are strange because this album is no way a 5 star album. In saying that it isn't a 1 star either. 2 Stars is the best I can give this. There have been a few reviews saying that nightwish are unoriginal and I agree with these reviews. It is impossible to put out much music nowadays without it being associated with something thats been done before. Nightwish are no exception. There music was done 20 years ago. Some reviews have attacked the singer. This isn't the best I've heard, but not the worst either, so again 2 stars. If you are into neo-classical opera type rock then you will probably like this. But no way is this as gooda album as some people are making out here, and to be frank I found a few tracks on this album annoying to listen to. Infact some of the tracks with their symphonic overtures, sounded plainly stupid."
2,I agree- 2/12 stars,Wow- wierd- Look at the review below- I feel the same way. One or Two good Songs-thats it. Her voice gets annoying after a while- almost to the point where you'd like to hear someone beat her to a bloody pulp in the middle of a song- just for the listeners amusement.
2,Cannot get into this at all,"The musicianship is different, but I just cannot get into this at all. Sometimes these bands can just go to far with the Opera influence and the music starts to sound fascicle. I prefer listening to classic garage rock like 'the Darkness'."
1,17 used says it all.,This has got to go down as one of the worst albums of 2004. 17 used already up for sale says it all.
1,Flopora.............,I agree with the privious review. This album Sucks. Why don't you bozos do a web search on symphonic rock?
1,Falls short of expectations,"This album is weary. The songs just sound daft. To use opera as a basis of rock, shows that Nightwish cannot write anything original. The singing is terrible, I know that because I have a degree in music. Overall, save your money."
1,Dissappointing,I cannot agree with any of these reviews. This album is stupid. There has never been much talent from Finland over the years apart from perhap Stratovariuos. But this band ain't as good.
2,Re: previous review,"I am dumbfounded by the comment ""lyrics are often left to the interpretation of the listener so if you don't get, make up something."" Is this why Metalicca has been so successful over the past 25 years? Lyrics need to have a meaning that makes a song. If you are only going for Nightwish because of their rythms then I am sorry to dissappoint you but their music is NOT original. It the same old story, a band releases a song over decade before and then a new band steals it and then re-sells it to the next generation that's none the wiser."
1,A proper review of the tracks with some changes,"1. Dark Chest Of Blunders2. Wish I Had Earplugs3. Numbo on my ears4. Planet Awful5. Creek=crap6. Sirens sound better than this7. Dead Gardens, dead tones, bleeding awful8. Suicidal music, wish I was deaf9. Ghost Love Music Score10. Stupid name for a stupid song11. Higher Than Hope this is their last album"
1,This band went downhill.,If you like pop music then you will like where they went with this album. I hate to say I hate the album it makes me sad.Their levels all wrong. Turning the keyboards down was horrible. Then turning the guitars up and simplifying them. While they were at it they also made the drums dissapear. I dislike Marcos vocals. I hope they go back the direction they came from before this album.It seems like some big producer walked up to the band made them mainstream their amazing music. I hope this isnt the end of the old nightwish.
4,A Laugh Riot Gorefest,"If you have a demented sense of humor and love gory horror flicks then this is for you. Dead Alive ranks right up there in hall of fame of horror comedies right next to The Evil Dead II and The Return of the Living Dead. Check this movie out for lines like ""your mom ate my dog"" and ""I kick ass for the Lord."" If you are a fan of zombie movies you owe it to yourself to experience this twisted yarn of mayhem."
2,The Goriest film since The Evil Dead,"It starts out as a kind of typical horror movie with its funny gore effects and hopeless acting, but then it becomes a zombie slasher fest with some of the goriest effects people have ever seen. A hardcore horror fan would die for this movie. People with a seriously strong stomach and love for wall to wall blood and guts will have a thrill ride."
2,A Curmudgeon Review,"I didn't know what to expect when I started watchingthis movie. The gore factor is high. It shouldbe listed as a comedy rather than a horror movie,though. It reminded me of the British ""Bean""movies. I am glad that I didn't buy this movie.Shaun of the Dead was a comedy that worked.This one went right past the fairway and intothe woods. Don't watch it with little kidsaround, or if you are queazy. Enjoy"
2,Comedy and violence dont go hand in hand,"The appeal of this movie would depend on how much ""life"" you got. This does not look like a film by the Peter Jackson we have come to know from LOTR. The violence and gore gets so outrages, you become numb after some time."
1,almost made me sick,"Warning:this movie is so nasty! I tryed to watch it once with my husband, (who loves this movie) but there was this one seen where these people are having dinner at this huge table. This woman who has been bitten by a rat monkey looking thing, as pus is coming out of her infected arm, and its going into this mans soup and hes still sitting there eating that soup not even noticing. I almost got sick on my husband, nor did i finish watching the movie."
1,I don't know how so many people gave this movie 5 stars,What a stupid movie!!! I didn't throw it out because i wasted money on it!!!
1,THE DUMBEST MOVIE EVER !,"THIS IS THE MOST STUPIDIST MOVIE TO EVER BE MADE. I'M SUPRISED IT WAS EVEN MADE INTO A MOVIE. MOST OF THE MOVIE IS LIP TALKING AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS MOVIE HAS NO SCARES OR IS NOT EVEN FUNNY. IT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE A 1993 MOVIE, MORE LIKE A 50'S FLICK GONE BAD. THIS MOVIE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO GET 1 STAR, I'D GIVE IT A BIG FAT 0 OR A F-. WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF THIS MOVIE BEING MADE. YOU WANT A GOOD ZOMBIE FLICK SEE: RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 2, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD AND DAWN OF THE DEAD."
2,"Great Film, Bad DVD","PLEASE NOTE -- This two-star review applies ONLY to this particular DVD edition, not to the film itself, which I'd definitely give at least four stars.""Dead Alive"" is a very clever horror/comedy that's a must-have for any Peter Jackson fan. Don't expect it to be scary. It's not, just riotously disgusting. In fact, ""Dead Alive"" is probably better described as a gross-out comedy than a horror film, having far more in common with ""There's Something About Mary"" than ""Hellraiser.""Unfortunately, this DVD is very disappointing. It's basically just an ordinary-quality VHS edition burned onto a DVD. The image is grainy and the sound quality poor; the film is only presented in full-screen format, and there are no worthwhile special features. No director's commentary, no ""making-of"" featurettes, no nuthin'.Peter Jackson is famous enough now that a ""Special Edition"" DVD of this film, one of his earliest, has got to be coming out soon enough. You'd be wise to save your money until then."
3,gore fest . . . . . . .. . PERFECT DATE MOVIE !,"ahhh . . this film is one of the funnest GORE films ever made . gallons of blood , zombie babies and a lawn mower make this this the greatest b - movie of the early 90's END"
3,Strange Movie,This movie was one of the strangest movies I have seen. I bought it because the Ghostbuster club memebers at the Arizona Con said to try it. It is somewhat like Shawn of the Dead but more gorier. The zombie baby in the movie is like something you will find in fangoria. If you like gore this is the movie to buy. This movie does not have a story that makes any sense though.
3,Neither Love Nor Hate,"This movie had great gore for when it was made and the humor was probably right on track back at that time. I chuckled a few times and said ""that's a lot of blood"" quite a bit and though I didn't like this movie much I really didn't hate it. If I would of seen this when it was made I would of loved it no doubt but over the last few years my taste has changed in movies. The gore is over the top but it really doesn't bother me that much anymore considering I was eating while I watched it. I would say at least every three minutes there is some sort of gore scene involved in this about a hour and a half flick and close to the end about every half a second. I only rented this and probably would never buy it since its not worth more than ninety nine cents but odds are if you love horror and over the top gore you are gonna love this but it just wasn't for me. I would say rent this movie and decide if it fits your taste or not since its not for everyone including fans of horror."
5,This Review is for the Unrated Version,"Before Peter Jackson struck fame in Hollywood with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, he had this hilarious gore-fest. As a fan of horror films, (I've seen hundreds) I can still safely say this is the single goriest film of all time, to my knowledge. Fans of Evil Dead will definitely enjoy this movie, as its similar material, just a bit funnier and much more over-the-top. The gore is so excessive it is almost comic, especially towards the end, but still, steer clear unless you have a strong stomach.All in all, this is the funniest gore-film of all time. Worth purchasing, even with some lacking DVD extras. Oh, and if you enjoy this and haven't seen Evil Dead rent or buy it immediately."
4,Hysterical!,"I was never much of a blood and gore fan, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was in New Zealand and subjected to it by my boyfriend at the time. By the time I actually opened my eyes and WATCHED the movie (months later) I found it was indeed one of the funniest things I have ever seen! The humour is witty (""Your mother ate my dog!"" ""Not all of it!"") and the effects are very realistic. I THINK that this movie is actually on record as having more blood than any other film."
5,One hell of a great movie!!,"What can one really say? This movie kicks more ass than anything I've ever seen! Although I didn't find it that scary, the use of gore made it friggin hilarious!!! You have 2 zombies doing it, a priest ""kicking ass for the Lord"", and the use of a lawnmower as a zombie-killing weapon. This sure beats the chainsaw used by Ash in ""Evil Dead"". If you agree that this movie kicks rumpass, either due to it's gore, horror, or humor, than you'll also love ""Evil Dead"" 1 and 2, ""Army of Darkness"", ""Day of the Dead"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and ""The Beyond""."
3,The Ultimate Gore-Fest,"WOW. I guess I should have seen this many years ago, but am just now experiencing this little bloody journey. Twisted but fun and oh, how it grows on you. The second and third time around I couldn't take my eyes off of the creepy baby. There's also a deliciously tacky cameo of 4E Ackerman at the zoo (good for Jackson that he paid homage where homage is due). I think this was Jackson's first venture into moviemaking. Happily, he improved with age, but the elements of his future brilliance can actually be discerned beneath the sanguine flood..."
4,Wish Peter Jackson Would Return To This Genre,"This is one of the most violent,brutal,excruciating, and gory films I have ever beheld.And did I mention that it is funny, metaphorical, and downright insane. If you are a Peter Jackson connoisseur you can immediately detect his scope and DNA on this film.In my opinion, the reason why this movie works on myriad levels is because of it's innocence and it's atmosphere which is almost trance-like. This is truly one of a kind film made by the greatest director of our time."
5,Best one-liners EVER,"I LOVE bad horror movies. I thought I had seen them all. Then, I watched ""Dead Alive."" I don't know WHEN I have ever laughed so hard. The one liners are PERFECT. ""Lionel! Your mom ate my dog!!"" or ""Geeeetttt mmmmyyyy dddrrreeessssssss!"" are perfect. ""I kick arse for the Lord"" and ""It's time for some divine intervention"" are amazing, too. The last scene of the movie has the best T and A shot EVER...although not the most normal for a horror movie. This movie is so bad that it's wonderful."
1,Barely Breathing,"The title of this movie should be changed to Dead because there is nothing lively about it. Yes, the movie is without a doubt the goriest movie of all time, but the compliments for this film stop there. The acting was pitiful and the story lacked a real ""bite"". The mere attempt at humor in this film was incredibly cheesy. I mean c'mon, a priest doing karate or ""divine intervention"" was how it was put, zombie's organs coming to life and attacking people, zombies having sex and then giving birth in a matter of 5 minutes actual time, and not to mention, a baby zombie that at birth can walk around and giggle. I watched this film expecting a solid zombie flick but got stiffed. This movie is an embarrassment of a zombie film and furthermore an embarrassment to the horror genre. Gore alone could not save this movie. Take my advice, don't buy this movie or you'll be dying for your money back."
1,goriest ever made...,"I give props to the props department LOL, but this movie STUNK! I agree it was the goriest movie made in the 90's, but how stupid of a plot!!! My god, it was like watching fake blood and brains splatter on a camera for 90 minutes...not so hot...some parts I must admit were pretty funny..."
2,goofy mess,"I liked the karate choreography. THe corny melodrama was cute and endearing. But ultimately the movie was dragged down by the monotonous goof gore. not quite funny enough to be comedy, not intense enough to be horror, it becomes a gross out movie. like a 2 hour snot joke.FOr Whatever it's worth I though the LOTR movies were LAME amatuerish hack jobs. People always recommended Dead Alive as an example of Jackson at his best and compared the movie to Evil Dead2. I love Evil Dead2 (both funny and a scarey thrill ride) so I gave Jackson another chance. Booooooooo! Sssssssssss!"
2,"Silly, sloppy, uninteresting","Maybe because I am more for the serious zombie movies like the Romero's series but I find this movie to be silly, with over the top acting and not even funny. The special effects are cheap and it reminds me of Army of darkness which is also a silly uninteresting movie as well. Overall: BAD."
4,The ultimate guilty pleasure horror film.,"""Dead Alive"" is a film that you'll either absolutely love and watch over and over or a film you'll turn off before the first half hour and have a bad taste in your mouth and complain for a week how horrible it was to anyone who's willing to listen. ""Dead Alive"" is only for a certain audience. Something you must keep in mind when you are watching ""Dead Alive"" is that it was made as a spoof on horror films and to be as cheesy as possible. It is very much like a John Waters film. It is such trash it is good. I recommend the best way to watch this film is to watch it with a bunch of friends, indulge in some... substances, watch, and laugh your booty off. I gave it four stars because while it is highly entertaining, I don't believe the ultimate purpose of film is to make entertaining trash but hey, once and awhile you need to see some brainless [junk] to unreel your mind and be in the right frame of mind again."
3,Dementedly funny and gorey,"I really thought i'd be in for a more dark, gorey film, but..I wasn't...Instead, it is a crazy, demented (British?) film about a different breed of zombies not like the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD type.It's goofy horror and not really that sickening gross. It's fun to watch. BUT, it you want to see a BETTER british zombie flick, buy BAD TASTE. A buddy of mine rented it on a whim like 13 years ago..and I LOVED IT!! I recently found that one on dvd...just 3 stars cuase it was kinda slow in the beginning until ""MUM"" got bit and the gore slowly built up till the bloody end!!"
5,Best bloodiest cheese fest ever :),"I have been jonesin' to see this movie for months and Netflix just wasn't satisfying me...I HAD to own it! The first time I saw this movie I was teen and it has stuck in my mind ever since. It shocks me how many gore/scary movie fans have NEVER seen this, which just goes to show how much of a fan they're NOT! If you love cheesey, bloody nonsense, this flick is for you."
3,Needs more attention,This film could definitely have been cleaned up much more. It is hardly better than watching it on VHS. I guess at least I can say I have it on blu-ray.
4,"I love this movie, but...",This DVD is the Edited version... cut from 97 to 85 minutes to get the R rating... Go for the VHS unrated version until Vidmark wises up and puts out the unrated version on DVD...Still Jackson is a genius as I'm sure you'll see even in this somewhat diminished version.
4,You have to remember this is a fun horror movie!,"This is not one of those serious ""leave you with nightmares"" type movie. So for those of you who have never seen this one before, don't go into this one with that frame of mind or you probably would not like it.Instead, this is one of those fun horror movies in the same vein as the Evil Dead trilogy.Despite it being fun, It is a really good movie complete with dead bodies, decapitations, limbs being chopped off, and all the gore you can handle as well as other surprises.I recommend this one for all you gore hounds & horror fanatics."
4,It really might be THE GORIEST MOVIE,"Without giving away the story, (which you can get in almost all the reviews I read before purchasing), this was an excellent addition to my collection of horror DVDs. Jackson made some very funny horror movies before Heavenly Creatures, (despite the title, not a horror movie), and the acclaimed Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is the best one I've seen of the lot. Gross out effects that, while obvously low budget, even made me gag in spots. This is very rare for me. For something to not look absolutly real and still gross me out is a talent few directors can claim. Peter Jackson is one!"
5,"Really disgusting, but good","Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE (a.k.a. BRAINDEAD) seems to have acquired the reputation of being the ""goriest movie ever made"". After viewing this DVD, I have no reason to disagree with this assessment. The sheer volume of spilled blood and severed body parts staggers the imagination. However, this would just seem gratuitous if not for the comic vision which Jackson brought to the film. Self-consciously cheesy in its plot, with the violence being more along the lines of slapstick (think ""Evil Dead 2"" but MUCH more extreme), this movie builds up to a ridiculously bloody climax involving a house full of zombies and one man with a lawnmower blade. It's not the type of film which is meant to seriously scare the viewer; rather, its a wild, hilarious ride. Those who are squeamish and easily grossed-out should probably avoid this, but if the concept of multiple decapitations and disembowelments sounds funny to you, you may well enjoy this."
5,The #1 of all the horror movies made,This movie was really grusome and gory.This is a horror movie that even the hardest stomach could'nt handle
5,"Absolute craziness, a must see.","This is one of the craziest dark comedy/horror films I have ever seen, rivaling my favorite The Evil Dead 2. This movie has the most gruesome action ever seen in film, but also has enough charm to keep you laughing the entire time. The beginning moves a little slowly, but the last 60 minutes of this film are pure genius. I encourage all to check it out, just don't watch it with someone who doesn't like to see blood. And remember, ""I kick ass for the lord!"""
1,A complete waste of $5,"I bought this movie based upon the high reviews here and because it fell into my ""Recommended for you"" cue. After (trying) to watch this god-awful mess of a movie I can tell you wholeheartedly: SKIP IT! This movie was so bad that I had to turn it off half way through. (Something I have done only 1 or 2 other times out of thousands of movies...) It is neither funny nor scary. The ""Gore"" is over the top and completely unbelievable in any stretch of the imagination. The acting is on par with an elementary school stage production. I give it a 1 star rating only because there are no ""negative star"" ratings, which this schlock deserves."
1,Bad Movie,Not much to say about this one. I turned it off about 40 minutes into the film - it was that bad!!!!!
1,STUPID!,"I swear this has to be one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen! Whats with all the good reviews? The movie had such poor acting and such poor horror sequences and when they tried to be funny I'm sorry but they just werent funny.... this has to be one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, sorry I wasted my time and money on it."
1,Fourth rate Sam Raimi rip off...,"Yep, that pretty much sums up Peter Jackson. But what do I know; he's rich, therefore brilliant!This movie is neither disgusting nor gross. It's just pathetic, idiotic and unoriginal. Simple as that."
1,Puhleeeze!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was like Young Einstein with zombies. Yeah there's lots of fake looking blood and gore. Big f-ing deal. Noteworthy, only for being an early Peter Jackson movie. On the plus side, I kind of liked the cheesy stop motion action with the Rat Monkey and the end sequence with the giant Mom zombie. Other than that it's unwatchable unless your a film student studying special effects for horror movies or something."
1,bad movie,THis movie is not good. Pretty much any other horror movie i have ever seen is better. The Whole movie is just horrible. There is some gore but if your looking for tons of gore then go see evil dead 1 or 2 there have much more gore then this movie. I would stay away from this movie at all costs.
2,It sucks,"Oh my god! I cant believe that some people...loved that film!! That movie sucks and i'm polite! I like gore and horror movies but there is limits (and i never tought there was before i've seen that movie) This is just too much!! I think the goal for the creators of the film was to put more discusting things possible!! The first 30 minutes, it was funny but after an hour i was already bored! That film has nothing scary! This is just discusting! But...if you really want to see the movie...dont eat in the same time!! Even if i would suggest you not to see it at all...For my last word...i'll tell you why i've put 2 stars instead of 1: The Dinner Scene! wich is funny!"
2,Dont expect Dawn of the dead with this film,"""Stupid"".Thats the one word i would use to describe this movie.Its a comedy with zombies.Dont expect true horror here.If you like movies like Evil Dead2 or Army of Darkness youll love this film."
2,"Campy, silly ""horror"" movie","If you are a fan of movies that are so-bad-they're-good, then this is the movie for you. The first half is funny, gory, campy fun, while the second half draaaaags on. The most memorable moment is definitely in the beginning when the mother's face fell into the custard! You'll be throwing-up and laughing at the same time!"
4,Classic Gore...,with a bit of humor. Entertaining gore flick that keeps the laughs coming. Very enjoyable and very worth it.
4,"Likely,the best of it's kind!","Hilarious goings on in Lionel's House when his dear old Mother dies,or do she?Hordes of flesh eating zombies,being chopped up with a lawnmower,bizarre mutations,an unforgettable zombie baby with an evil laugh,and zombie sex!?And a very good transfer from Trimark,make this uncut version a must for fans of the genre!"
2,avoid this R rated edition,"This R rated version of one of the goriest , funniest horror/comedy films next to the Evil Dead trilogy is about worthless. There is minimal violence , and nearly 15 minutes of footage is lost..and alot of scenes are missing adding more confusion to the film. 2 stars just because it's a great movie..but this edition stinks!"
3,Really far out on gore.,"This is one of the most goriest horror movies I've seen in quite some time.The acting is pretty dumb.But when you're a fan of gore,who really takes the time to care?I liked the the lawnmower scene.I also think this film is a little corny.But I'm a horror freak.If you like outrageous blood,guts,gore,the works,then Dead Alive will please you.Buy the way.They'retwo versions of this film.So if you really want to see a smackload of gore,rent or buy the unrated version.Remember that this film isn't exactly all horror.It's not one of the best.But it is really gory."
4,Ride the Short Bus to Zombville,"It's a very 'camp' film.Pace wise, it's very slow.So, in a lot of ways, it's like 'Slow Camp'.Not that you can't have fun at Slow Camp, I know I enjoyed all those summers making crafts with little rounded scissors!In fact, an ashtray I once made looked a lot like the claymation creature early on in the film (that's not a good thing).The FX in Dead Alive was not where the budget went, though Bill Cosby was heard to say ""Wow, that's a lot of pudding! Meh-heh, mumble mumble wit da pudding."" The budget went to the cinematography and the acting - which (from the classic characters you'd expect to the reluctant-Hero and spunky-Heroin) was really well done all around.I liked this film.But then again, I like to discover the ""treasures"" in my navel at the end of a long day.YOU HAS BEEN WARNED!;)"
2,Too gross for me to enjoy,"I generally like campy horror films, and several offer more sophistication than is available from the more polished films from bigger budget studios - Cemetery Man and Army of Darkness are a couple of my favorite films. However, the grotesque imagery of this film surpasses operatic, and ultimately drwoned out anything else for me. If the acting, writing, or cinematography are good, I could not tell because of the nauseating effects."
2,"Yucky camp, or campy yuck; does it matter?","This movie puts yuck into camp. One just has to wonder where ""fun"" will finally end up at; this one was over the top for me. The combination of ultra-gore, bad acting (intentional, one supposes?), rotten music (had me climbing the walls during the first 30 mins), and a silly unoriginal zombie plot got me initially bored and then disgusted; a weird mix. If you get a thrill out of seeing body parts flying all over the place, with tons of reddish-pink paint, go for it. I suppose some people will get a yuck-yuck out of a couple dismembered body scenes.... But really, there must be a better way to spend 100 min."
2,STUPID...,"I love horror films, but this is just downright stupid. Idiotic plot, bad acting and second rate gore effects make this a film to miss.."
2,DONT FALL FOR IT!!,"If you like anything Romero, anything Fulci, shoot even Children Shouldnt Play with Dead Things-DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. I was suckered into these ""OH SO DISGUSTING-OVER THE TOP"" reviews and it's not. Of course campy, silly and one of the first scenes in the zoo, a zombie rat is..get ready....CLAYMATION!!! Rent it first."
2,When will someone get it right??,"When I read all the reviews about this being perhaps the goriest movie ever made, I had to own this one. This movie started out more like a love story than a horror flick, then it eventually got interesting, had some good spots and then it went over the top ridiculous. I love good shock value and gore as long as it is looks realistic, blood should not look like water with red dye shooting everywhere. It took away from the realism and feel of the film and basically made a joke out of it. If you like the concept of cartoon horror i.e. Evil Dead II you're in luck, this is a 5 star movie. If you prefer a good story, along with good acting, and realistic effects that make you feel part of the movie, this is not for you. Keep looking."
1,GORE GALORE but.....STUPID!!!,"Everyone talks about the gore, blood and guts. SO WHAT! All of it was wasted and ruined by the comedy. Evil Dead, Return of the Living Dead, etc., had SOME comedy, but this movie drowns itself in over the top slapstick. If the comedy was taken out (95%) and the script was re-written, this would have been a great movie. Add some dark atmosphere.....u know what, just completly re-write the movie all together. What a waste of good gore. Can't ANYONE SEE THIS?!"
1,Dead Alive,A most rediculas movie. A total waste of time and a story that didn't make any sense. Stay away from this mess.
1,Worse then evil dead ?,"Boring,overused dumb gory scenes & a horrible director ""Peter jackson"", gives you this disgrace known as dead alive.If your retarded you'll enjoy it but if you know the difference between good & crap you'll not bother.When a Sumatran rat-monkey bites Lionel Cosgrove's mother, she's transformed into a zombie. She begins killing (and transforming) the entire town while Lionel races to keep things under control. Events culminate at a house party that turns into a blood-drenched zombie buffet. Peter jackson only make movies like this as an excuse that he sucks at being a director even lord of the ring sucked only nerds that cant get laid enjoy it."
4,Bloodiest movie of all time?!,"If you are looking for the bloodiest movie of all time you have found it!Dead alive is an awesome gore movie and one of few to come out in the 90's.Dubbed by everyone ""The Bloodiest Movie Ever"".I have to agree.I think if you see this movie you will probably put down the cheesy effects of the the Rat Monkey of Sumatra.But the gore effects start going on in the middle of the movie.Yeh the beginning is a little boring but once the blood starts spilling it don't stop.The bloodiest scene is the lawnmower scene and the priest scene is awesome too.Quote on Quote I kick a** for the lord!And so does this movie"
4,Classic Gore Fest,"Why I had not seen this film earlier on is a mystery to me, as I am a huge fan of the horror genre. Knowing that this film was essential viewing for any true horror fan, I rented it with great expectations. I was not disappointed. I was wondering when I rented it however if all the gore was being hyped up, and if I would be let down. Once again, I was not disappointed. The gore factor of this film was precisely as they had made it to be, over the top. From the disgusting ""custard"" scene to the lawnmower finally, it was terrific! Of pleasant surprise was the dark humor of this film. I found myself laughing out loud more than once. All said I would give this film a 4, or perhaps as much as a 4.5. I highly recommend this film to any horror fan, or those persons just looking to view a fun film without an intricate plot. GOREY!"
4,GORY but FUNNY,"This has to be the goriest movie I have seen yet, but done in such a way as to not be disgusting. The story is so funny that it overrode any adverse reactions I might have had. Very original thought to the storyline."
4,Awsome ! Real name: Braindead.,"Crazy, gore over the top, gross, real trash but awsome fun with scenes such as: taking baby zombie to the park, the kung-fu skilled catholic priest whose warrior shout: ""I kick ass for the Lord!"" will remain in the records of motion-picture history, the bulb-lightened zombie head, the lawnmower zombie massacre (a change from Tobe Hooper's chainsaw!) and so much more of likewise madness."
5,must-see romantic comedy (with horror elements of course),"Braindead (Dead Alive's original title) is the best Gore-film you will ever see! It is breathtakingly hilarious, horribly bloody, absolutely inventive - and probably the only splatter movie you can watch with your girlfriend...well...almost! It even beats Jackson's own Bad Taste in gore, fun and style. A must-see!!"
5,Dead Alive Eats up others,"If you are a fan of the Evil Dead Triology, then Dead Alive is a definate keeper. Ten times the gore, ten times the laughs. How can you go wrong with Rat Monkeys and Zombified babies. Make sure you get the unrated version when you buy this movie. All horror fans, get this one now."
5,Few (if any) zombie films are more entertaining. None are more gory.,"The goriest film ever made is like a big roller coaster: it will be a fun ride for most but it will make some nauseus.This is one of those very few films that grabs you in the opening sequence and refuses to let go until the credits roll. Dead Alive ABSOLUTELY refuses to compromise. There is no such thing as too gross in this film: Needle in the brain, puss in pudding, guts that turn into some creature of its own, lost arms and/or legs, deformed zombie child, and much, much more. You name it, they got it.But don't let all of the grossness deceive you. If you know that all of it is special effects, it actually is a very fun ride.This is a film that most people, especially men, can enjoy (an obvious exception being very small children). What makes this film work, more than anything else, is feeling that the people who made it had a fun time making it. And that's what really counts."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this video especially considering the cost and Caterpillar endorsement but was disappointed. My son loves watching big earth moving equipment and out of an entire 1-hour DVD there was maybe 15 minutes of good scenes. Part one was kind of bizarre. Most of the 1/2 hour was spent on Glacier National Park ,some obscure circus in Wisconsin and a toy train. And a large portion of scenes with machines were mostly old footage of antique tractors. I also did not like the video quality. Most of it consisted of 1 second clips strung together. Part 2 was better but still not what I was hoping for."
2,"If your child likes the ""I Love Toy Train"" videos....","This may be the DVD for you. It was created and follows the same format as the popular I Love Toy Train series. However, I find the footage on these dvd's less stimulating than the train series. Most of it appears very old and certainly wasn't recorded or produced for the digital format. It also lacks any technical explanation of the vehicles. I would recommend the Real Wheels (There goes a Bulldozer, There goes a Monster Truck/Firetruck/Tank etc.) series. In addition, I Dig Dirt is also a good find (and much cheaper than this one)."
4,Enlightening,"I was taken by surprise when I saw the level of affection and intimacycaptured in these photos of men from another era.I can't imagine men of my time allowing themselves to be caught in expressions of such open affection.I seriously doubt that all these men were gay men, so how does one account for the shift in what is socially acceptable.Men of my generation would likely be most uncomfortable, I think, with what appears to be genuine affection and buddyship, but it may be that the lives of those men were enriched in a way that we can't appreciate today."
3,"God, These Men Were Ugly","I bought this for my best friend who's gay. I almost hesitated doing so, the men in these photographs leave a WHOLE lot to be desired. He likes it, though, because he has a few of these old postcards, and is a photography buff to boot. So, I supposed just based on that, if someone you know shares that interest, they may like it."
4,Compelling Story,"After thoroughly enjoying Gale's first two books, ""Sins of Touch"" and ""Kennedy's Commandos"" about the often-hilarious adventures of her Gumshoe Girls, I eagerly anticipated this new book ""Tell Me Something Pretty"". I was surprised to find that this is not fiction about her Gumshoe Girls, but a true life story about herself and an ill fated romance she had with a bona fide con man after the breakup of her long marriage. From the moment I started reading, I could hardly put the book down. Her story is told in intimate detail, great humor and sarcasm. The only bad thing about the book is that the story ended. It was also interesting to learn what she was doing at the times she was writing her first two books (or at least the first two that I read). I highly recommend this book."
5,Real....,"I had just finished my second trip into the boundry waters , when I came upon this book in the Trading Post of the Base that I was leaving out of. It was an Eight hour ride home, so I had plenty of time to read it. The pictures are so beautiful and realistic even today when I look at the book it feels like I am back ""Up North"""
3,Pointless Dribble,"Pointless dribble describes the essence of the text. Outstanding photography draws you in however, the text does not back up the potential of the book. THe pictures create an outstanding book; the words can make you loose interest fairly quickly. Little is added to a person's knowledge of wolves. Most of the text drags on about his life and the ravens in the area. I was unimpressed with the 5th grade reading level and the only thing that kept me going was the pictures."
4,A great story of trauma and tragedy,This is a fabulous story about life in the past with a Fier. It is a thrilling taleIt is a thrilling tale about a curse that lives in the liveof someone involved in the horror of the curse.
2,Sony combo,"This is the first Sony product that I've ever owned that I was truely disappointed with. Its DVD player makes a high pitched whirring noise when playing, and stops frequently during chapter changes. Also, if there is the tiniest of scratches or smudge on the DVD, it will skip, stop, or simply not play it. On the bright side, the VCR works perfectly. One other major gripe, if the power shuts off for half of a second, you'll need to reset the time which is a pain in the butt. I'm a Sony fan, but this one is a dud."
1,Caught on fire,I went to place a DVD in the tray. I pushed the eject button and nothing happened. I pushed it again and waited. then smoke started coming out of the tray area. I wanted people to know so they can be careful. I would personally take it back before something happens. Mine is in the trash. What a waste. It worked fine until then. I read the other reviews and I am not even going to bother calling Sony. I am going to report it to Consumer Report. Be Careful.
2,Not a good buy,"I purchased this DVD/VCR combo and for a few months it worked fine. After this it became a nightmare, first the picture would break up, then it would just stop working and turn itself off. After a couple of days of this, I called for service to Sony. Getting it serviced under warranty was even worse. This is why if you want to buy a DVD/VCR combo I suggest you find another brand that will make itself responsible for it's product.Good Luck"
1,SLV-D550P - Bad quality,This unit worked for 6 months only and then it broke. It's a very poor investment and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,Bad Sony is not an oxymoron,"This is the only Sony product I have ever been disappointed in. I bought it both for the Sony brand name and the VCR+ feature. I wanted to use it mainly to play old tapes and time shift tv shows (and buzz through the ads), and maybe watch the occasional rented dvd. The vcr playback is crummy--through a glass darkly and fuzzily. The picture quality in the one dvd I played was okay but not wonderful. It's not even tall enough to use as a footstool. I can't even throw it away; the trash collectors won't accept electronics. I'm really disappointed with Sony. (Think I'm going to buy another Sony anything real soon?)"
1,Sony's Junk DVD Player,This DVD player should not be sold by anyone. This product lasted less than 30 days and I purchased it as a gift for someone else. I also own the SLV - D350 combo which was working at the time I placed the order on this one. It has since broken less than 8 months from the original purchase date and I barely used it.I would suggest that money spent elsewhere on practically any other manufacturer would be better spent.The sad part is I love Sony and have a television and digital camera which they manufacture and I love them! Someone needs to get them out of the DVD business and make them stick to the things they know best!
1,SONY has gone bad,"Like many of the others I buy SONY, no need for reviews, I assumed I was buying a quality product. It amazed me to see in several review sites, how the average life cycle is nine months! Well, I bought mine on July 17, 2005 and is not working since January 17, 2006; 6 months exactly. The warranty is good for 90 days and after that I have to pay for both shipping the item and the return and labor, the warranty only covers the parts. My problem? the VHS works; the DVD sound comes and goes. The cost of what SONY wants me to do is almost what I paid for this piece of junk. After I said NO, they offered me a refurbished one for $35!. How many have they gotten back?!! No thank you. It is just sad to see how a good company is riding on its good name and no longer cares what product it offers its FAITHFULL customers. After reading more reviews, DON'T accept the refurbirshed version either, for many people on CNET they have NOT worked!"
2,2 stars for the time period it actually worked,"Now, after what appears to be a standard 9 month life expectancy, every DVD I put in the player now results in the message ""Error"". Actually, the VCR player still works great. I guess now I'm expected to be ghetto and buy a new DVD player and stack it on top of the broken one, so I still have a VCR player! I guess you can't even trust a name that has a proven track record of quality products. I know it will be more trouble than it's worth to try to fix it!"
1,So upset,"it jammed video tapes right away, including brandnew one's.After 5 months the dvd stopped working altogether.I trusted Sony and didn't keep the receipt, too bad."
3,"Far from excellent, but not useless","I read this book translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book is concise, short, full of photos(all Black And White) and very easy to read.The failures of this book are small.The biggest failure of this book is, to be very short.This book hasn't enough informations, about this subject.Even as an introduction to this subject, this book hasn't enough informations."
2,"Weak even in title, about Nazist secret weapons","About twenty years ago, I read this weak book, about Nazi Germany secret weapons.And this book is weak even in title, about Nazist secret weapons.There's more photos, than text, in this book. This book is concise and easy to understand, but outside these advantages, this book is weak.As an example of this weakness, about V-2, there's some informations, but the author didn't wrote that V-2 production by slave's labor, killed more slaves than enemies in London."
4,Kick Start and That's All (not for architects),"The book delivers exactly what its title promises - a kick start. The term ""kick start"" does not imply going from 0-60 in 6 seconds.There is virtually no in-depth coverage of advanced features, such as beanutils or scaffolding, but those fall outside the scope of the book. There is much coverage of basics such as the HTTP protocol, session management, and MVC.More advanced readers should probably opt for [...]the more obscure and advanced knowledge."
1,Pure rubbish,"When I am writing this review, the price of a used copy starts from 56 cents. You can imagine what quality you can expect from a book whose owner is so eagerly willing to part with it.I did read this book and here is what I have to say. In short, do not buy this book or even read it. It's a waste of time.I can't believe Craig McClanahan recommended this book. How much did Sams pay him to say that?"
2,Just another illicit affair!,"I had just read Death Comes to the Archbishop, by Willa Cather and loved it. I found it truly fair and a beautiful view of New Mexico in its earliest days and how influential the Catholic faith was to the whole region. I am not Catholic (would you believe Mormon?), but I gained great respect and love for those devoted servants of the Lord who went out to settle western America and build in them a Christian faith.Soooooo, I read the inside cover and found other books by Willa Cather. I knew many of them, but wanted to read one I did not know. Imagine my disappointment to find it just another book about an illicit affair! Yep, I am a prude and admit it, but I felt she was so capable of better themes...in fact, I know she is! Hence only 2 stars. No, I didn't ""hate it"", but I was surely disappointed!"

3,Nice but needs improvement,My son got this at 8 months. He didn't really start to enjoy the vehicle until about 12 months. I agree with the previous reviewer that it is quite difficult for an adult to steer the vehicle. There needs to be a steering lockout so that the child can not steer while an adult is pushing. Also the foot rests never stayed where they were supposed to be. They were constantly getting pushed under the car and therefore defeated the purpose.
1,Not safe!,"My 11 month old son really liked to ride this car. But it's very unstable and tips easily to the side. He fell very hard to the side right in front of my eyes, it happened in a split second. He hit his head and face on the floor and got a big bump on his forehead and a bloody nose!"
1,buy something else!,"This ride-on was a gift when my son was 12 months old. It is VERY unstable and not durable. The only feature my son was interested in was the removable dashboard which plays music and makes different sounds. If you're willing to spend extra money, I highly recommend the Radio Flyer sport coupe. You won't be disappointed."
2,Beware of Tipping!!!,"This looks like a great push/ride toy, but it's so light and flimsy, it's more of a hazard. We bought this when my daughter was 9 months, thinking she'd grow into riding it, but it turns out, the best part of this toy is the controls that play songs and noises. First, the control ""center"" is not secure in the car - my daughter pulled it out and threw it across the room day one. Second, you can not push and guide the car, it's too light, and only steers from the front. Last - and most important - if your child is not stable DO NOT let them in the car alone ever - it will tip when they want to get out, causing them to get caught (it happened once, and she wasn't hurt thank god). Now that she is 16 months - she likes to push it around, and play the songs - but that's about it....I'd consider this an OK toy, but nothing great."
4,"Vroom, vroom, boing!!!","Great sound effects, used velcro to keep the sound section in. Our son pushes it around, hides toys in the seat storage and loves to press those buttons. Overall we enjoy it, if he gets tired of pushing, he goes for a ride.Could steer better and be weighted better."
3,Too much plastic,Nice toy overall. Could be more durable I has to much plastic and the steering wheel CAN NOT be block to go straight with is bad when the kid don't know how to use it and the parent its pushing...
1,Dangerous - this can and will tip over,"I bought this on a whim at a toy store without checking the reviews first - what a mistake! My little guy is nine months old and 21 lbs. and he was able to tip this over while he was riding in it. I was right by his side, but he tipped it away from me and was on the floor in the blink of an eye. It's also impossible for an adult to steer, as mentioned in the other reviews. I really liked the idea of it being 4-in-1 and having the bars on the side, but in my opinion it is not safe."
3,mad dutchman,you want crazed dutch prog rock from the early 70's - you sure - well in that case this is the CD for you.
2,just too expensive,"AlwaysDirect did an excellent job packaging and delivering. They actually packed it with 2 freezer bags to try and keep it cool. Now the freezer bags were complete thawed by the time i recieved it but I appreciate the gesture. The chocolate was fine and not melted. My only complaint is it is too expensive. Target sells a 9.5oz bag for $2.99. This ""tub"" is 40oz(note: product description is wrong. It is not 12/4.6oz packages; it is one 40oz tub). So it should be no more then $12.59 and with the shipping it is 67% more expensive then just buying at Target. Don't be fooled by the count because this is the foil wrapped andes and are 1/2 the size of the ones in the Target pack.So good product and delivery if you have no other option but way over priced."
2,Ehh,"I bought these for $120 and was not thrilled - I'm an electronica producer so I may be biased but do have an appreciation for accuracy. These have little to no bass and were tiresome to my ears in both fit and fatigue due to sharpness of highs and midrange. Oh yeah, I burned them in - must have had over seventy hours on them before my cats chewed them up (those bastards)... But I bought a pair of the Sennheiser CX300's and now feel the cats did me a favor. Much more comfortable, priced at a third of these and have excellent bass response with smooth highs... it's all subjective when it comes to earphones but this was my experience."
1,Don't blame twenties recording techniques for this one!,"This CD is a compilation of tracks from the ""Early Ellington"" multi-disc set, which is hands down the worst digital transfer I've ever heard of this material. It's got an astonishing amount of high-end distortion that has absolutely nothing to do with the 78s themselves, and will be torture for any dogs in your neighborhood. I've heard very low-grade copies of these 78s that sound much better than this CD. The first couple of songs are pretty much unbearable even if you turn the treble all the way down. As the program goes on the poor transfer is still in evidence, but it's not quite as horrifying.If you have the slightest interest in this era of Ellington's music, try the comps on Phonodor or Jazz Archives instead."
1,"14k Yellow Gold 1.1mm Italian Box Chain Necklace,18""","Dear Sir,I am no expert in jewelry so I only know what I've seen,but this ""14k gold necklace""is the worst pice of junk that I have had the unfortunate exprience to have had to bye. Did I actually said I bought it? Well then shame on me! Anyone even thinking of byeing this you've been warned!{so don't be anothere shame on you.} Just Don't do the same thing as I did resist yourself from buying it. Sorry guys make sure you put out a product worth selling for $65.00 or don't sell it at all!Sicerly,"
1,Not a fit,"I ordered this guitar case for my Luna Henna Oasis guitar. It was too small. I wrote to Luna directly. They said it was an old case, that they are no longer using that manufacturer. They agreed to swap it for the new style case at no extra charge. I am happy with Luna, not so happy with Amazon. Amazon needs to keep on top of such changes. This case may fit other guitars but it is a Luna case that was advertised by Amazon as the correct one for my guitar."
1,One of the worst TV's I've ever had....,"Shame on Sony! I had a 10 year old Sony Trinitron (which was great) that broke, so I bought this mess of a TV. Granted, I have basic, analog cable, but come on! There are 4 color choices - Pro, Vivid, Standard and Movie - and one is just as bad as the other. You have to change these and the other Picture settings for each TV program. The face color is either too red or too green. I don't if it's the comb filters or what, but the whites (letters, clothes, whatever) are all out of focus... I was squinting and trying to focus every minute watching Jeopardy. And anything in the background is out of focus. Thank goodness I had 30 days to return it to Circuit City, which I did. Now I'm using my son's old Philips (better picture than the Sony) and I would hang onto it except it is so old, there is no hook-up for VCR or DVD. The only 2 good things about the Sony are it looks nice and the sound is good. Put your money elsewhere, not here. It stinks!"
3,"Great picture, NO AUDIO OUT. need I say more?","Ok, great picture quality, s-video in. The speakers kinda suck, so you would need external speakers to hear movies better, but alas there is no audio out, so no way to connect any external speakers! Wow, that sucks! Get the Samsung instead, similar picture quality and audio out."
2,Cheesy at times,"The good parts are choppy and along with the many comments on the fake applause: check out Let's Live For Today and Midnight Confesseions by The Grass Roots starring Rob Grill, the lead singer is not even playing the bass guitar. It is so obvious."
5,YEA!!!,"This should be a great dvd. Lots of great artists, great songs! Can't wait to see these, but have to wait for Christmas! Great price, arrived early, great condition! Thank you!"
1,Not beginner friendly,"Sorry to say, this book is not for a beginner. Very confusing layout and the following of chapters appear disorganized. I have researched many books online and in the brick/morters, and this book is near the bottom.As well, I have friends/classmates who have agreed."
1,NO GOOD,"It worked for a short time (couple of months) ....the ""green light"" goes on still and CPU/laptop reads it, but when you connect anything into it, nothing is recognized."
1,Poor DVD Transfer,"I was eagerly awaiting Heimat - one of the greatest classics ever. However, the DVD transfer is the worst I have seen. It was like looking through a foggy window. I am not kidding. Rent and see for yourself. Do not buy this version of the DVD and reward the nitwits who released this.Apparently Region 2 version is better although I haven't ordered it yet."
5,"A true masterpiece, and a fine DVD production","I'm very confused by some of the previous, negative reviews. I did buy the ""region zero"" DVD release and it's perfectly fine. The series itself is a true masterpiece, a sublime work of art.One of the previous reviews referred to the ""fogginess"" of the DVD transfer, but this is a television series that was produced in monochrome and PAL color, not Cinemascope. It's supposed to be perceived in a haze: it's an intentional effect meant to allude to the visualization of memory. Sometimes black-and-white, sometimes color. I personally find it extremely effective."
3,"Uneven script, but addictive viewing experience","My only complaint about this DVD package is a lack of supplemental material. A character gallery or an interactive family tree might have helped. As a TV series, Heimat is somewhat uneven in quality and suffers from some odd continuity (it never explains, z.B., how a German immigrant to the US with, as far as we know, no money and connections or the ability to speak English ends up as a millionaire CEO in just 17 years, during the Depression no less). The entire ""Little Herman"" section is dull beyond belief and can be safely skipped over, since it contributes nothing to the main plot beyond several scenes of the smoking hot German actress Gudrun Landgrebe in the altogether. Taken as a whole, however, Heimat is addictive viewing, not unlike a fictional version of Michael Apted's ""7 Up"" series."
3,Bill Malloy looks for answers...,"...and doesn't much like what he finds.He confides to Eizabeth Collins Stoddard that he believes that Roger Collins framed Burke Devlin on his manslaughter charge ten years ago...and that he then bribed Sam Evans to back up his story.Meanwhile, since he would not allow her to formally accompany him to Bangor, Carolyn follows Burke to his out-of-town appointment."
2,Ahhhhgggggg,"I got this game because my girlfriend wanted to play it...It continually locked up, and many glitches such as getting stuck in a wall and not being able to remove your skater. Really the game is not as fun as they used to be. Not to mention I thought the park editor would have advanced considerablly on the 360 but it has not..."
2,Ok check this out,"The game is fun, i loved it but there are many problems. One the game is f**king short, I beat it in like less then a week. There is more stuff to do after it but still..Also when you go up to people it will say ""Yo Skater"" on the bottem when really he says ""Hey Skaterat"" and a lot of the subtitles on the bottem are wrong and off. Also at time you will go up to a person and all there will be is the subtitles they dont say anything. The game looks pretty good, they plays look alot better but still need extreme improvement. All and all it's a fun game but some stuff is just wrong with it, to me it feels like it was rushedm, or it didnt get copied down for the 360 version so good."
1,no,tony hawk has gone down hill with this one. the graphics look like playstation 2 graphics. the story is short. the only thing saving this from the pooper is the classic tony hawk controls which ive grown to love. maybe cool if you have never ever played a tony hawk game....but if you have...then this isnt that great.
2,Terrible Port For Xbox 360,"Not what I expected, the graphics haven't been improved at ALL, there's some framerate issues and LOADS of glitches, but multiplayer is top notch."
2,This Game Hasn't Aged Well,I went back through the original 360 games to see which ones were worth still playing.This game isn't all that bad but lacks in quite a few areas. The story tutorial doesn't guide you through the moves very well. You will be facing challenges needed to level up without any guidance on how to complete them. The characters are very hokey and the dialogue is pretty stiff. The animations are worse as when they talk you can see clear down their throats.If you love Tony Hawk games then this one will probably suit you well. If on the other hand you are a casual gamer and not specifically fan of the genre then dont pick up this game and try one of the 6 others for the 360.
2,Nothing good,Didn't like itI wasn't like the old games that I enjoyed playing. Hard to access different levels. I played it once and now its just sitting in my room.
4,Time consuming but worth it!!!,The plot is time consuming in story mode but if you're into the story it's totally worth (that may be a big IF for some). You can also fall back on classic mode if the story gets boring.
3,"First part is good, then the author drifts...","With a catchy title like ""Bible Analysis"" how can this not be a best seller? The first 13 chapters of this book are great. The author does a good job of explaining the process and need to properly study and how to rightly divide the Word of God. Unfortunately, in the last two chapters the author takes on a bazaar interpretation of the book of Revelation and his stance of a mid-tribulation rapture. The first thirteen chapters make this book a good buy for any student of the Bible."
4,Very good book!,I misplaced my book years ago and was thrilled to get another book. I got the newer version for comparison and I must say that I like the newer version better. More information.
2,None of These Diseases,The book came right away in good condition but the book was disapointing. There was very little reference to biblical teaching.
3,Inexpensive & Gets the Job Done,"I was looking of for a basket that would secure to the garage wall to organize things. Went to the big box stores, looked online, etc. I was suprised at how expensive a simple wire basket was. Then I finally found this Racor product. I bought it because it was one of the least expensive products I found. They tout the ""interchange wall dock"" system, and if you want to move your basket from one location to the next and be able to secure it to the wall at the various locations, then you will like that feature. I don't plan on moving it, but bought it any way because the price was right. It also works well as a statioanry wall basket. As an added bonus you can mount it fairly high then pop it off the wall, sort through it, get tools, etc., then pop it back on the wall when you are done with it, so I actually kind of got a lucky bonus with the interchange wall dock mounting feature."
4,Real American Music...,"Buy this album and tell your friends. Powerful songwriting combined with a earthy country/rock beat. It's what Mellencamp never could be and what most of Nashville refuses to be. The comparisons to Earle, Springsteen, and the like are all good, but Knight stands apart. One can only hope that radio will pick up on this guy, and a label like Decca might get him there. This album is a gem."
5,its a great cd,I think this is a great CD. Knight is an old time songwriter who tells it like it is. He is not as well known as he should be but he is a man with talent who deserves to be heard.
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Knight certainly crafts some catchy melodies and the top-notch players he gathered for this CD knock out the tunes perfectly. I love to listen to it just for the playing, arranging and recording. The lyrics on the other hand make me laugh. The first time I put this CD on I took a double-take to see if this guy really was singing ""it ain't easy being me"". I thought, he's not serious, is he? Am I missing something here: Some sardonic turn of phrase signaling that the song is more than a guy wallowing in self-pity? Nope! I guess Chris' pain is one of a kind and more extreme than anyone elses. And why are the stories he tells so dramatic? No finesse. I don't need to be knocked over the head with such blunt sentimentality. He writes about all the usual bum deals in life but with about as much depth and sensibility as those messages you find written in your high school yearbooks. Still, I listen to the CD, shut out the words and tap my foot."
4,Where did this guy come from?,"This has become one of my favorite CD's; with Framed, Summer of '75, and House and 90 Acres being my personal favorite tracks. There are about ten good songs on this CD for those who don't buy for just one track (I don't). If you like Robert Earl Keen or Charlie Robison you'll love Chris Knight."
3,Not enough for exam preparation,The content in this book is definitely not enough for exam preparation. After reading the entire book word to work I would say It only prepared me 60%. Rest of the information I need to get it from other sources mainly from MSDN help. The good part I found is it outlines exam objectives very well so that you can do you additional readings from other source but that you can also get from exam prep guide in microsoft website. I still recommend this book becuase I don't see any better option.
3,A Good Start,"This book is a good start, but you won't pass the test by just reading it. Experience and practice test will go a long way to help."
3,It's OK But...,"I give the book three stars because I just passed the test and couldn't have done it without this book. However, I agree with most of criticisms that have been posted. Particularly galling to me were the very poor index and the mistakes in the examples and questions"
2,Useful informatioin but real bad explanations,"Actually I am editing my oppinion after reading this book almost three times now ... The silly typos and mistakes over the book are a fact, however I'd like to say that I really learnt a lot with the book, and overall found it very useful.I missunderstood the focus of the book, and expected more of a ""how to do"" book, when really it is a logical and structured list (withouth to going into too much depht) of the .NET Frameworks features. After reading simpler books, and with a bit more experience developing in .NET, I actually went back to read it again and found it very very useful.In my oppinion a lof of people commit the same mistake as I did, and expect more of a learning book, than a proper study guide."
4,Good book,"Very good book to start your preparation.But still lot of details are not covered up thatare important for the exam, making MSDN a must along with this book."
2,70-536 Exam Prep,"The book has quite a few mistakes (not just the usual typo). Entire chapters are, lets say more or less either copied from the help with no additional insight or otherwise lack additional value. The included tests are faulty. The coverage of test questions is only ""garanteed"" by the provided practice tests, NOT the book itself.I still think it is a good starting point to get an impression of what the actual test might require. OTOH just following the test related table of contents (70-536), reading the help and trying everything yourself + purchase of practice tests would most likely be better (something you'll have to do in any case since the book does have quite a few white holes AND you can't rely on the answers provided by the practice tests)."
5,I like the way this book is organized,"ofcourse this book is not for newbie level it is for people whom they want to pass the exam, i read manybook before this book and cover in depth the .NET foundation but the topics are not organized in a way to be memorized for the exam, this book is simple to memorize the questions for the exam"
2,Wait for something better,"The book is too long, with irelevent information for the reader. The book covers all samples in both Visual Basic and C Sharp, making the volume twice the size (and probably price). However, the exam lets you pick one language. Why spend time covering the differences between VB and C#?The authors completely ignore C++. This is a valid language choice for exam 70-536. (Look at the microsoft website, under 70-536). So if you are a C++ developer, you need to reintepret the C# samples. However the authors have no problem giving every example in both VB and C# to make their book bigger.I gave this book two stars instead of one. This is only because of the 90 day 2005 Professional edition, and the Exam discount.The discount runs all the way to 2010.After reading their book I am considering writing my own. I can give examples in all three languages. That way I can charge one third more money!!!"
1,This book is truly overly complicated,"I brought this book in order to learn how to program. I wanted to take the exam. I had to get a dictionary to make it trough the text. The author seemed to take a very complicated issue, and make it even more complicated by the use of the types of words like antithesis, and obfuscate. While I know what these words mean, it would have been a much easier read if he would have used plain english. I have a bachelors in CIS, and 2 masters degrees. An MBA, and a masters in project management, and I still had a hard time making it through this text. As the other reviews have suggested, I had to purchase 2 other texts to learn the language. I have since been designing web pages for a year, and I have never, ever, opened this book again. It was a waste of the $49 bucks I paid for it."
2,Low on content despite page count,"This book follows a preview, view, review, and re-review approach to teaching the .NET Framework. I think that's probably appropriate for someone who's just starting out, but most programmers will be bored to tears. Couple that with the bi-lingual approach (both VB and C# are covered) and you've got about 300 pages of actual content. That's too bad because there's a lot more value in covering the material quickly (just the facts), but if you like review and need to program in both languages, this book is for you!"
3,"Good enough to help me pass the test, about all","After reading this book cover to cover and taking the practice test many, many times I was able to pass the test on my first try.What really pissed me off (along with my co-workers) is the amount of errors both in the book and the practice test. The book has so many typo's and errors the there is 2 (yea TWO) knowledge base articles for the errata. About 15% of the practice test questions (out of 300+) were just WRONG. Either the answers were not correct, or there were no correct answers.Ok, enough of the rant. Like I said, this book did help me to pass the test, so for that I give it 3 stars. Had i failed the test it would have been more like 1 star.Take that for what it is. Since this is the ONLY book for the test, you are kinda stuck... Just be ready for errors and frustration."
1,This is to Bad For Words,"So many errors that it has to be done in 2 partshttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/923018/en-ushttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/935218/en-usIt looks like I still have ver 1 I'm still seeing the errors listed on the Microsoft website and I just purchased the book 01DEC07. This is really, really bad. This is something I don't need trying to study for this exam."
2,Embarrassing,"It seems this book was written by a team of beginners and I'm not talking about the numerous typos, but something like ""class"" instead of ""object"", ""include"" instead of ""using"" (many, many times) etc. It deserved 2 stars only for the exam voucher and for being usable after a look at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923018/en-us for a long list of errata."
2,Out of date,"This product didn't meet my expectations, and I found it very difficult to follow. I had to buy another book for the 3.5 version, and that was much better."
3,Useful as a test prep.,"Book is OK, I've passed the test without problems, but it is not reading material which I'll often use a reference.It is full of facts, but boring and lacks real world examples."
2,Don't Bother - Go for the Second Edition,There are heaps of mistakes in this book - it makes it so hard to learn things for an exam from! I believe the second edition has been fully revised and the mistakes fixed so I have purchased this one now for my study.
4,Decent Book,This book has a lot of useful information in it and the practice tests do help quite a bit. Good book for beginner developers with some experience with visual studio.
2,"A few good chapters, but the rest is very poorly written","About 3/4 of the chapters are either very thin on explaining the subjects, or they are written so poorly that, frankly, I got quite upset whilst reading. Another thing is that this is the most error-prone book I've ever read. In a novel typos aren't critical, but in a study guide for an exam, they are indeed. So be alert and use the errata. I found out it was better to take the hours needed to correct the text, than spilling time wondering about the accuracy on stuff that looked weird to me. My advice: buy another book !"
2,Certain chapters need to be completely rewritten,"Avoid this book unless you are prepared to spend 10 times more time on certain chapters than is warranted. It's not the case that the book would be OK if the known errata were corrected; certain chapters have many more errors and faults, and need complete rewriting by someone other than the original author.The publisher needs to issue a 2nd edition of this book with the following chapters completely rewritten: 9, 10, 11, 13, and probably 16. If these chapters aren't rewritten, when another publisher with proper quality control provides an alternative, that should be used instead of this book.For example, code listings are presented to demonstrate COM interop, but there are no paragraphs explaining the code, and there are no comments in those code listings. It takes an inordinately long time to make sense of these chapters, due to the dense errors and lack of actual explanation."
2,Extremely Poor Editing,"This book seems to cover all the necessary topics for the 70-536 exam, but the errors/typos are totally unacceptable. This is probably the most poorly edited book I've ever read. Repeated paragraphs, copy-and-paste errors, code that doesn't compile....you lose confidence in the book and when something doesn't make sense, I find myself wondering if I don't understand the concept or if it's just another error.Again, if you can get past the errors, the book does cover all of the necessary topics."
2,Passable at best,"This book is better than nothing but there is a lot of room for improvement regarding quality. It went a long way towards helping me pass the 70-536 exam. This book has an alarming number of typos in it, tends to gloss over some important items, and is missing some key exam items. I bought this because I didn't want to wait months and months for other resources to become available. If you can wait I suggest you do."
4,"Good book, 15% off voucher, and software inside",In my humble opinion this is very good book. I didn't take the exam yet so I don't know if it works but after reading over the 50% of this book I can surely say that the way this book is written is the one of the best (for me of course :) ) there are some typos but I can surely recomend it to all who wants to learn new MS technology and of course who wats to take the 70-536 exam :)
2,Ok coverage but lots of mistakes,"No book can really cover the entire material but the no. of typos, mistakes and incorrect code samples is really exasperating ... however if you are willing to supplement study by yourself, the practise questions and exams are sufficently indicative of the real exam."
1,Kit Exam 70-536 Book Too Many Errors,TOO MANY ERRORSAfter reading 200 pages of this book the numerous errors was a distraction. After visting Microsoft's web site and seeing the list of corrections I felt that this book should be recall and the people who purchase this first edition should be entitle to a refund or free replacement of the copy they purchase.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK UNTIL CORRECTION ARE MADEWAIT FOR THE SECOND EDITION
2,Not the best .NET 2.0 framework textbook - to be generous,"Some of chapters (specially at the beginning of the book), are quite good and I found interesting information in them. But the rest are very poor, and can do more harm, than good to one who reads them.Some code snippets, even if they work, are very good examples how you SHOULD NOT WRITE programs.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, who doesn't have some experience in .NET programming and expects to learn from it. But it is quite good reference for the exam. I don't think, you will be able to pass exam using this book alone (unless you know .NET so well, you don't need any book to pass it :-))."
4,Second Edition now available!!,"Please note that the second edition of the 70-536 Training Kit is available. Fully updated and revised, the second edition replaces this first edition, and is the one to buy to prepare for the 70-536 exam."
3,Teaches the fundamentals for the test,"I read this book in preparation for the 70-536 exam. As the other reviews say, the latter chapters start to show a breakdown in editorial skill and in-depth description. The bottom-line is that if you have over a year of good concentrated (not college classes) programming AND you read every chapter of this book to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals covered in the test, you will probably pass. The practice tests that are included leave a little to be desired as well, while they do get you familiar with the concepts of the questions that will be asked on the actual exam, the practice test questions will not contain any of the actual questions on the test (you'll need some supplemental brain-dumps for that)."
3,So so,"The book looks like it was written in a hurry. Did anybody proof read it? For example, a test question at the end of one lesson is about topic covered in the following lesson. I just hope it will get me through the exam, somehow."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"For years I neglected buying this CD because I felt that Procol Harum had long since peaked and that their last two albums of the 70s were dissapointing (Procol's Ninth), and p*ss poor (Something Magic). But this CD is very different. It is simply a great late 70's album. It was nice to hear Gary chill out and even sing some love songs. Track 6, ""Something To Remember You By"" is an incredibly beautiful composition."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!,"I bought the CD for the More Than Anything song, but I love the whole thing. I don't think a day goes by that I don't listen to at least half of the CD. I am playing The Rest Of Forever at my wedding and the song describes my husbands as well as my own last relationships. I just bawled the first time that I heard that song. Thanks for recording it,"
4,What livin is all about,Delivery time was great and the CD is great. The only thing is the case was cracked when received. I am very happy with the service I received.
3,"14K 1mm round snake chain 16""","The chain is lovely but I ordered 16"" and got 15 1/4"".Both chains I ordered, 16"" and 18"" were about 3/4 to 1"" shorter.That seems deceptive to me. You should get what you paid for!Won't buy jewelry from here again."
5,Just turn the lights down,"I had an incredible urge to turn the lights down low, while listening to these songs.It's a great compilation of reggae love songs. It will bring back memories.You'll love Carlene Davis, Marcia Griffiths, JC Lodge and all the others. I know I did!"
5,Can't be with you tonight,"This song is awesome. ""I love him the same way I love you now, but I can't be in two places at one time...Please understand my situation"". This woman is pouring her heart out. Actually I didn't hear her song on this album. I was listening to the Washington, D.C. Station WPFW 89.3 FM. It comes on most Friday night from 10pm-12am. They play African, reggae, third world music. The D.J. is named Charlie Dee. The first time he played this song I went to the record store and looked through every Reggae CD because I couldn't remember the name of the Artist. I found the song on Reggae Lasting Love Songs Vol.1 Various Artists. I've been wearing that song out...Her voice puts you in a comfort zone. It makes you think about what you have and what you have lost...Both ways you come out loving both people equally, one in memory and one in the present...Beautiful, Beautiful...I'm buying this her original CD today (Artist Judy Boucher)...""WOW"" Good Job...I'm singing in my head now..."
5,Nativity books,these are cute. They were smaller than I expected but I feel the small kids who love stickers will love them
2,"Very Small, very Disappointing!","This is a tiny booklet with 25 stickers for a manger scene.The stickers go in the marked spots on the small front and back cover. As other reviewers noted, they are difficult to use. They are not ""traditional"" easy to use stickers. I would not describe this as an ""activity book"" as children think of something fun and larger.Save your money and buy something at Dollar Tree. At least they wore a 4 for 3 promotion."
2,very very small,not more than an hour of game and then in the garbage.the stikers don't stick again and it is very small.
3,Nice book,"This book is very sturdy but doesn't hold a child's attention very well. I like the fact that it can be reused several times and never tears up. But how many different ways can you arrange a manger set. My son likes to play with these books while we are in the car going for short distances, but other than that it doesn't get much use."
4,TwoWorlds is a keeper,"If you enjoy playing Oblivion and Gothic, you will enjoy this game, too. It is not on a par with those games, but does have a number of elements from each plus other RPG games such as Sacred. It is outstanding in load time and game saving options. The graphics are not quite up to Oblivion standards, but better than Gothic. Early in the game, the hero dies a lot, but it is fun figuring a way to overcome opponents. Later, after acquiring stronger weapons, much armor and many spells, the opponents are either too easy, offering little challenge or too hard, killing the hero with a single blow. I have not completed the game yet, but will probably replay it later with a difficult setting."
2,not that bad,"Ok, first of all the filmakers struggle to find stories where there is none and try to create drama by zooming in on expressionless faces. What's up with that?? There are some cool things about this movie though. Hot chicks. The producers did a good job of finding good looking people for this movie...."
5,The Real Good Movie,"I don't understand why so many people thought that this was a bad movie. Honestly, I just got this movie two weeks ago and I've watched it at least 3 times already. But I'm also a big fan of Road Rules/The Real World tv show. If you are a big fan of those shows, then you will like this. If not, then chances are, you won't like it.The Real Cancun is like the Real World with problems between most of the members and a sexy twist of wild scenes. I think it's a great movie, since it was unscripted. This movie has a lot of drinking, sex and dirty dancing so if you're a fan of all these and reality tv shows, The Real Cancun will be the real good movie to you."
1,Don't bother watching this... a waste of time,"This is probably the biggest waste of time, I ever spend watching a video. This is not a 'Spingbeak' flick, or a story or any kind of acting or even a documentary, it is simply a NOTHING! Don't waste your time or money on it!"
2,is a show on dvd,"is a show like the real world, and the road rules, but in dvd and with an ending, will get you hipper but not the best, if you want the real cancun you better of going there for real."
4,So Bad Its Good!!,"I knwo that many people hated this flick, but I thought it was great. Lots of trampy people tramping around, dumb drunk men saying dumb drunk things, and the infamous virgin who turns out not to be. Though it is a tad on the graphic side, I would recommend this one to anyone looking for a silly flick to relax with. This film will definitely make you want to go down South, though maybe not for Spring Break.... LOL"
3,So-So Score 4 The Real Cancun,"The people that brought us The Real World now give us The Real Cancun. It was better than I thought it would be, but not by much. Too be honest the action seemed a little too tame or edited to hit the R rating. If you missed out on Spring Break this might be worth a look, but if you want hot action I suggestAMERICA'S WILDEST BACHELOR PARTIES or WORLD'S WILDEST COLLEGE PARTIES."
1,The worst movie known to Mankind,"I have never seen such a piece of trash in all of my life. If you're expecting the light fun of the Real World series, this is not it. This is pure crap. No, it's worse than crap, but I don't think I can use the words here that would TRULY describe it. If it were possible, I'd give this negative 5 stars.The filmmakers take no time to introduce the characters, you are just plunged headlong into a week full of boozing and hooking-up. The kids sleep all day and drink and party all night, and that's it. Nothing more. I really feel for the parents of these kids, they must be so ashamed of how their children turned out. I'm ashamed, too, though, that I wasted my valuable time on this horrible film."
2,Pass on this.,"I was really hoping for a lot more from this. It was surprisingly dull and only briefly caught my interest during the short wet T-shirt contest. Unlike ""The Real World"" or ""Survivor"" I didn't really find any of the participants to be interesting enough for me to care about what they were going through. For a movie about Cancun it seemed pretty tame, but I guess I should have realized that from the 'R' rating. Maybe I'm just too old and jaded (and the fact I live in a college party town) to be excited by this film. This might have been more titillating if I were just reaching puberty..."
1,"Wow, stupidest movie ever","Luckily I didn't pay to see it. The only reason why I watched it in the first place was to see some half naked hot chicks, but even in that department it was lacking.You would think a brainless movie about spring break would at least have some hot chicks half naked. Nope. Just one wet t-shirt contest that you can watch on any episode of Wild On.It tries so hard to be like Real World, but fails miserably, no interviews, bad editing, and the idiots who they picked to be on the movie are boring. On top of that, they seem to play for the camera, most of their dialogue is akward, as if they are only having a conversation for the sake of the movie. WTF?If you are looking for a brainless movie with half naked chicks, fast forward to the wet t-shirt segment, watch it, then switch off the tv."
1,MTV needs to grow up,"Here is the proof for why the rest of the world hates us. After seeing these mindless, soulless sex-crazed pod people parade around like they were GODS in this sad excuse for a movie, I can see why America is viewed by others as an evil country. What exactly do we value anymore?"
5,"Alcohol, Babes, and a Storyline","When I grabed this movie off the shelf at my local video store I thought it was going to be full of partying and drunk chics taking their tops off. I was right, but I was very very surprised to see that also in this movie was a very strong storyline. The characters came together like a family and did a very good job getting along with each other. This is an AWESOME documentary, but is also a drama, comedy, and kind of a love story. If you don't watch this movie, then you are a total loser! I can't wait to go myself."
2,Somewhat Dull...,"This film (if you can call it that) was passable, nothing brilliant though, and sometimes remarkably mundane. Nothing really happens here, and that's the problem, no conflict=no story.The characters, well none of them have much substance, no values at all really, as a study of human nature it's pretty depressing, though their are insights to be had. The characters are shallow and vapid for the most part, and unless you're like that yourself, it's hard to relate to any of these muscle guys or air head girls.In summary, as far as reality tv goes, it'll kill 90 minutes if the need be, though why kill what little time you have;)"
1,America is not ready for a reality movie,"Why watch a film about the most pathetic people ever to grace film? They have NOTHING to offer society. There are very few people in this that are worth the time. This 90 minutes of trash is a slice of America that really makes this country look bad. Normally I enjoy a good party, but with people who have personality. None of these people have even a hint at a personality. The only personality some of them have is getting drunk and showing off their naked body. These people are dumb. Now you see why it bombed at the box office!"
3,Corona Clipper LR 3460 1/2-Inch Long Reach...,Corona Clipper LR 3460 1/2-Inch Long Reach...isn't long enough..it needs to have extentions ...most trees I cut are ornamental..but still higher than this..i could get on a ladder..and trim with regular clippers..the blade is sharp..the handle okay..but why didn't they make a little extension to twist in *to close up or out..to extend...
4,Cute Clipper,"This is an ideal tool for my Dwarf Fruit Trees whereas I used to have a ladder in order to prune them ,I can now do it from theground without any problem"
4,Good for Water Garden Use,"This pruner is very sturdy and works fine for pruning my water lilies. Pruners made especially for water garden use cost much more than this item, so I consider it a good deal. I'm not sure if it will stay rust-free after a couple of seasons of use, but I'm satisfied with it right now."
5,Long-Reach Pruner,The pruner works great and prevents my having to use a ladder which is a lot of trouble and sometimes unsafe. The Cut N Hold feature is also good since cut branches can be moved to one side and dropped onto the ground instead of having them fall into the bush.
4,A good introduction to Ella,"Ella is truly one of the masters of jazz. Her comforting sounds compliment almost any mood or situation. Ella and Friends is a great introduction to her duets with Verve from 1944 - 1951, still the early years of Ella. Her voice is still very young and very feminine, without the earthy richness she acquires in later years.While the tracks with Louis Armstrong are classics, the others are more hit and miss. Other classic Ella includes anything with Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald: First Lady of Song, and the songbooks."
5,Ella Has GREAT Friends,"And she is pretty great herself- the greatest female vocalist ever ....at least, I think so. And this album will show you why - the songs are just perfect for a singer of Ella's range and caliber - when Ella sings, you know exactly what the lyricist had in mind. This is one terrific collection of Singers and Songs - a must have for any lover of the Great American Songbook."
4,GREAT selection,"This is a really nice Ella selection. It's a favorite for replayability. There are probably better albums, but this one has variety and plenty of hits."
1,Don't waste your time & money!,"Beautiful, isn't it?Don't be fooled, as I was. This item is as filmsy as a soda can. When you connect all three parts together the handle comes a loose from face plate. This a not a true drawer pull for customers to daily use. It is only worth displaying for show because it is thin, weak and cheap! I wih I could rate it a zero. Would not recommend...unless you want it just for display."
3,model railroader,"The street car is a great seasonal item (Xmas) probably for the model railroader enthusiast since having G scale track, a power pack and electric connector, are all needed if you don't already have a G scale train setup.The street car is internally illuminated which adds to the excitement however I was disappointed that Santa and the Elf don't do anything. Santa is slightly movable and can be positioned to wave. Only one headlight on the trolley is illuminated at a time depending on the direction its moving (forward/reverse).If you are not familar with G-scale units, be prepared for a large space requirement (5'-0"") circle."
5,Disney is always Entertaining,"The grand kids enjoyed the Rescures, I remember watching this when my kids were little, You can never go wrong watching a Disney Movie."
3,"Great movie, but not so much the case","the movie is great,but the case it comes in is horrible all 3 disks are stacked on top each other and causes it to scratch."
5,It looks great! Truly!,"I loved these movies growing up. When this came out on blu ray, I bought it immediately. I did not own them on DVD so it made sense to just go ahead and own them on blu ray. I believe that it looks amazing though. It is crazy to think that they can restore so much of the original to look this good in the digital conversion. If you love the Rescuers or you want your kids to love the Rescuers, here is your chance!"
5,Win!,Rescuers and Rescuers Down Under on bluray? YES!I've watched this a few times since I got it and love it. The packaging is the norm - same standard bluray as normal. Was grateful it didn't have those silly side clasps.
4,all the movies that i recieved from amazon,every movie was fantastic i just love whatching good old movies.i like the thriller and the action but i also love the good old cartoons
5,The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under,I love the part that Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor play in this movie. It is very entertaining and a movie for all ages. (I'm just a kid at heart)
5,Down Under is an Absolute Favourite!,"I don't remember the first film all that well, but I've watched the second at least a dozen times; I'm sure I'll watch these at least a dozen more. Everything clicks in this movie, from the animation to the dialog to the music to the comedic timing. And don't forget the phenomenal cast, which includes the much missed John Candy and George C. Scott!Seriously, this is a template for how to put an animated feature together, as there are no missteps here. It's a brilliant project all the way around, and serves as a perfect example of a film that can appeal to everyone."
5,Great movie,"This movie I remember from my childhood and now that I watch other choldren I wanted to pass on the greatness. This is an old fashioned Disney movie, less characters singing, only a few big name actors lending their voices and one price for 2 movies. Also with one DVD for Blu-ray and 2 for regular discs, I was able to give the regular DVDs away and keep the Blu-ray for myself!"
5,Rescuers 35 th edition,"The grandchildren love it and have added it to their collection, delivered in a timely fashion and as described in the ad, happy with the purchase."
3,Bonus DVD Packaging,"This review is not about the Blu Ray, which is outstanding in both the picture & sound. Instead, the review is about the packaging of the 2 bonus DVD's. Disney decided to go with a double case instead of a triple case. This resulted in the 2 bonus DVD's being stacked on one spindled on-top of each other, resulting in the top DVD being scratched. Surely Disney could have spent a few more cents & gone with the proper case to accommodate the 2 bonus DVD's & the 1 Blu Ray. A little disappointing for a company that always stood for quality."
5,classic disney,"I love that ole drawn out look early disney films had.Hence, I prefer the 1st film over the second but their both good. These films are really cool and LOVE the fact its a two films w one purchase cd. :) Yeah! Love those lil country swamp critters and Evanrue. I hope I spelled that correctly?! No regrets. Happy w purchase."
4,Good movie pack,Great family movie. The first one is kinda of sad. My five year old son cried during the movie because he felt for the little girl. Th second movie was shorter than I thought but still a classic Disney movie.
5,LOVE these movies!,"I watched the original Rescuers when I was a kid (am 29 now), and then when I was about 10 and Rescuers Down Under came out, I fell in love with it, and was especially obsessed with Cody, the little boy in this movie. A few months ago I decided to buy these movies. I am so glad I did. They are so cute, and fun, and very clever. I love the voice of Bob Newhart as Bernard. The relationship between Bernard and Bianca is very sweet and endearing. Fast shipping from Amazon, no problem."
4,Urban Pop with an arabic twist,This is a hip urban pop music artist with an arabic touch to it all. Sounds different? It is in a way and it stands out from all the regular pop music we hear on the radio. That is probably why the famous stick and bass player Mr.Tony Levin is surprisingly on this Canadian CD. This french arabic artist made me travel with her music and I sense this sensuality throughout the album all the way to the end which includes a hidden track of a cover tune from Roy Orbison Crying over you in arabic...WOW!!
1,The Great Billy Connolly (3 CD Set),"The product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition, so I have no complaint about that. I was extremely disappointed with the product itself. Much of his monologue is drowned out by laughter of the crowd, and what you can hear is extremely difficult to understand as his Scottish brogue is the strongest I've ever heard for Billy, and I've been a fan for over 15 years."
3,Everybody knows that...,"Zsa Zsa Gabor is the worlds greatest actress,and everybody knows that...That cost you two stars.The rest of the album is great, although the strong Scottish brogue does get a little hard to understand at times.Amazon.com has this listed as only one CD, but mine came with three CD's.?"
1,Cruel!,"I lost all respect for the protagonist Dianne Robbins after she failed to report a horrible case of animal cruelty (against Orion, the poor puppy who was repeatedly beaten by Buddy)! That might sound petty, but what kind of person could ignore that? Animal abuse is a crime. Shame on Dianne for being too self absorbed to take action.I did not like this book at all. Perhaps I'm too much of a dog lover, but I was too disturbed to enjoy it."
4,Beautiful and emotional,"The wonderful story of mothers and daughters and a mother's love for her very disabled daughter. Very much a tear-jerker, but in a good way, with even a little romance thrown in."
1,Unreadable,"I'm trying to understand how anyone could have given this book a good review. It's just plain awful, written in such simple sentences, giving an almost elementary school level reading experience. As I tried to plow through it, I found myself asking isn't there something better that I could be doing right now. Hardly, the page turner some reviewers raved about. Life's too short to waste time on this."
1,"Sappy~With a Capital ""S""","Yikes! I love Luanne Rice, and have read each and every one of her books. However...This one was simply awful, I am sorry to say. It was SO overly sweet and sacharine, I found myself nauseated throughout most of the book. It was also unbelievably repetitive- I did not need to hear a million times over about Dianne's contempt for Tim, the circumstances of his abandoning her, or the deep connection between she and her daughter, Julia. I got it after the first few times! It was also really predictable, but not in a good way....and the scene with Amy and the dog in the river? Please, that was the last straw. It was beyond far fetched....it was just silly. I expect better from this author. Some of her previous novels have moved me to tears, but this one is a joke. My best advice is to skip it."
2,Vanessa had it right!,"I agree totally with an earlier reviewer, Vanessa's point. Like this author, didn't like this book. The beginning held promise. The story in between was pages and pages of predictable developments. The denouement wasn't worth the read. The good seed, the bad, The altruistic, the selfish. All contrast,no shading."
4,Better than the Movie!,"I had bought this book to take on vacation, but had such a great time on vacation that I never got around to reading it. I came home to see an add that this Hallmark made-for-tv movie was going to be playing in a week, so I started reading. I loved the book! The movie was ""okay"", but I was disappointed how much the movie left out and how it twisted the relationship of Dianne and her ex-husband. That's Hollywood for you!The book is a wonderful story of a mother with the ultimate love for her handicapped daughter, but still has so much love to give a neglected girl who befriends her daughter. I enjoyed reading how the relationship between Dianne and her brother-in-law, a pediatrician, develops as he cares for his neice and is always there for Dianne after his brother desserts them. A heart warming story."
3,Romantic and Sad,"I am not a big romance story fan, but this book is quite good. The characterization is extremely well done. And different than most stories of the genre, this one has a handicapped child as one of the main characters. As a reader we learn to love and respect this tragic girl and I came to realize that no matter how many obstacles a human being has to overcome in their lives, they are valuable members of our society. We need to take the time to get to know and understand them."
5,Amazing!,"This was my first Luanne Rice book. I told all my friends, run, don't walk, to the library or book store to pick this up. This book was so good that you really felt for the characters, you felt like you were pulling for Dianne and Alan to be together. You wished her mom were your mom.......mine was wonderful like Dianne's, but she's gone now. I just loved it. I can't wait to read more Luanne Rice books!! This book leaves you wanting a sequel. A definite feel-good book, and I see it was a movie too. I'd like to try to find it in the stores!"
2,Preachy,"If this book tried any harder to say self-important, warm, pithy points, I was going to scream! The editor had to have been asleep at the wheel here. Some good editing, especially of the moralizing parts, could have saved this book. Alas, too late."
3,"Romantic,endearing but left me wondering","This was my first opportunity to read a Luanne Rice book. Once I began it was hard to put the book down. The characters came to life and left you wanting to know more about each one. I enjoyed the switching back and forth between various character's stories - current and present. The two questions I had were what finally brought Diane to the fact after 12 years of indifference that she was in love with her brother-in-law. Although it was a beautiful love story it seemed to have elements missing. The biggest disappointment to me was the ending. Although it was sweet - I really wanted to know what really happen to these two characters - did they get married, did they have children, what happen to Amy and Diane's mother??I would have liked to see the author place a 2-3 page Epilogue to round out the story."
1,rockin chair lady,"Rockin' chair lady: half the cd skips, not much to say after that. Quality of recording is fine but the cd skips"
5,Mildred Rocks!,"This is an excellent CD of great music. Sure, her voice is squeaky, but the she knows how to sing, and the music is great! Got it at Amazon."
4,the book was good,i liked the book. it was good. the beginning was suspenseful.the ending was kinda poor but ok.i read the book the day i got it.if you r an adventurous person then get 1 of these books.
4,Great!,This book was cool! It needed a little work but it was good. The end was kind of good. The beginning was fantastic! By Jarel
1,A RIPOFF,"The Perry Mason Season 8 Volume 2 is a major ripoff for several reasons. These are (1) the high price - which would be partially acceptible except for the fact that (2) the liner notes have absolutely no relationship to the titles and the actual programming. How could such a total screwup get past the editors? and (3) the quality of the disk is poor - I have never seen more viewing glitches and on the second program, had to restart the disk because it would not track thru.I am an Amazon customer who has purchased every one of these Perry Mason cds because I enjoy the programming. However, this disk is a travesty. I would ask that Amazon reissue it with correct liner notes, with the playing glitches corrected, free to all customers who have purchased it so far. For those of you thinking about buying this one, you might want to hold off."
5,DRAMATIC PRICE INCREASE!!!,What is with the high price for the second half of Perry Mason Season 8? Whoa!! I feel like amazon is taking advantage of fans.
1,"show is excellent, price is a bad joke","does that title have more episodes than other Perry Mason DVDs? nomaybe it has some special features, that other Perry Mason DVDs haven't? nodo we have inflation rate 30%? noso, $49.99? really? not even funny:-("
1,Duped and Cheated - Fifth Rate Merchandise,"I talked myself into buying Season 8 Volume 2 even though the price is totally unfair and outrageous. So I open it up and pop it into the video out of sequence (I put in disc 2 first because I was looking for an episode I'd seen once as a teenager) based on the description of the episode in the DVD jacket. Well, the description was totally wrong. Lo and behold, the next episode was also described incorrectly. I checked the IMDB and compared the descriptions. So not only do we pay a ridiculous amount for 15 episodes; the packaging is not even correct. I actually want my money back. This is absurd."
2,the case of the disgruntled customer,"Even though I pre-order my dvds, I always expect to see a price decrease on or about the time of release. Not this time. As a matter of fact, the price is still $50.00. what gives Paramount Studios? To add insult to injury, my copy arrived today with a damaged jewel case, a problem I've noticed with Paramount stuff recently,( Mannix the final season),both jewel cases were damaged in the same place indicating a bad packaging machine. Furthermore, it was brought to my attention that the liner notes are incorrect. It's bad enough having the high price,which I can't really afford, let alone all the other flaws. I think Paramount has some explaining to do!"
3,error in liner of shows,"I love Perry Mason and was excited about getting the 8th season, volume 2, however I was disappointed when I realized the liner notes did not go with the episodes, I called Amazon and they promised that they would remove it from the purchase list and get the people that are supposed to watch for this call the company, I am reluctant to try to get it again as they told me it could take months to get this corrected and the show has been on the purchase list the whole time."
3,Perry Mason Season 8 vol 2,The episode summaries are totally incorrect but the titles are correct. I did not buy this dvd from amazon having found it cheaper elsewhere. Ray Collins is credited but does not appear in any episode.
5,Great tv show,I am greatfull that they have brought back these great tv shows. If they didn't I would not need a tv. The shows on today are horrible.
1,price,"I like others cannot believe the price increase WOW ......I have all others but will hold out for a while on this one... I still have Season 8 Vol 1 to watch ,I will try to stretch it out ."
1,Price is outrageous,"I have bought the series as it's been released and I'm sure as the sun comes up in the east that they will release the WHOLE series for far less than what we all paid as each HALF season came out. Look at Mannix, McMillian & Wife, Columbo same thing. I bought the Wild Wild West as it was released and then here comes the whole series AND THE TWO MADE FOR TV MOVIES that I cannot get separately so I got fawked over once again.Now I wait until the release the whole series ( they didn't get me on Mannix, I waited just like I'm waiting on Alfred Hitchcock ). If I hadn't already bought so many seasons of PM, I would have waited that out as well."
1,The Same Price Elsewhere,I checked the price of season 8 vol 2 at other major retailers. Both Barnes and Noble and Walmart are selling this DVD between 48.99 and 50.00. Not that this helps any but it does give an indication where the price hike originates.
1,Bend over for the over priced DVD,The series is great but the price is gouging the fans of Perry Mason.I've been watching this on METV and were on the third episode of this half of the season.I don't care for the commercial breaks but I'm not paying the $50.00 ransom for this HALF of the eighth season.Thanks METV for showing Perry and his Gang!
3,Messed Up Liner Notes,"The quality of the DVD is fine, the price is a little high but the real irritation is the messed up liner notes. The titles of the episodes are correct but the descriptions are not even from Season 8 - they appear to be from Season 7! If you are a fan and are looking for a specific episode but do not know the name of the episode, only a vague recollection of the subject matter, these liner notes will be of no help at all. Hopefully CBS will correct this error and if so, I certainly hope those of us who purchased this DVD set will be able to get a corrected set of liner notes."
1,"Perry Mason, Season 8, Set 2",The price on this item is totally out of line! Let's be reasonable! The other DVDs in the Perry Mason series average around $30-35.
4,season 8 vol 2 liner notes...,...are incorrect. The titles are the right ones but the episode descriptions are from season 7 vol 1. I've also noticed the wrong cast lists playing at the end of some episodes.
1,Say wha',"Looks like we're ALL payin' for obomba care, now!Too bad, too, 'cause this was such a good series!I'll find it used somewhere."
1,This paramounts to coercion by Paramount,"I guess I will stop my collection at Season 8 Volume 1. I am not paying anymore than $24.95 for any other half season. Remember that we are still in a recession and that we are not stupid. The quality of the Perry Mason show's script went downhill after season 6 anyways, so no big loss for me."
4,Follow Up on Other Comments,"I share concerns about the price of this set. I have purchased previous volumes from a local store in Madison, WI which recently closed.As already observed there is a production flaw. While the episode titles and air dates are correct the episode descriptions correspond to the episodes in Season 7, Volume 1. This has to be an example of the sloppiest editing jobs of all time."
1,The straw that broke the camel's back,"This review pains me to write. As many others have stated, this is unfair but I can guess why. I'm guessing (actually hoping... otherwise I will be angry) that they have raised the price to cover lack of revenue from S8 Vol 1. I have every season including S8 Vol 1. I also have most of these Vol 2 episodes as well as the S9 episodes from various sources. The series was winding down in S8. There were many good episodes but not up to the quality of the earlier seasons in my opinion. I'll continue to watch my current library until the price is reduced. In any case, at this price the entire series would have set me back $900.00!"
3,The inside synopses were incorrect.,"The discs played as they should. Although the inside cover information was correct as to the episode, the synopses were from Season 7 Vol. 1. Aggravating. I know the fault lies with CBS, not Amazon."
2,Jacket Messed up,Has anyone else noticed that the synopsises of the episodes on the cover don't match the episodes played? High Price and not accurate besides. The titles match but not what happens. Very strange.
5,A little something for everyone,"If you like an album that offers a mix of hard rock, R&B, gospel,a dash of country, mixed with a healthy dose of blues, you've come to the right place. Brian Templeton is the former lead vocalist/harpman for the Boston band Radio Kings. With the guitar and production of Mike Welch (a great blues talent himself)this album smokes!Templeton really knows how to please. And he can write a good hook too. He does a great version of Hank Williams ""long gone lonesome blues"", and Marvin Gaye's Trouble Man. But my favorite on here is ""Memphis Senorita"" with it's beautiful Allman Brothers style slide guitar. This is a very diverse album that you could call Americana as well as blues.All I know is this a great first solo album, and one of the best of 2000."
5,great price,"I wanted to get a HDMI cable for my xbox 360 for a long time, But i could not justify paying 29.99 at my local store for the xbox 360 HDMI 10 ft. cable...even though this cable is only 3 ft. i thought what the heck for the price it was worth the gamble...with shipping and all it was just over 5 dollars...it not only fit excactly what i wanted it gives absolute great picture and sound quality...i am VERY happy with my purchase"
1,Signal cuts in and out,"Bought two of these HDMI cables along with a new Samsung TV and Blu-Ray player. While watching Blu-Rays & DVDs all of sudden the picture and sound on the TV went blank and would stay that way for several minutes or until I turned the TV/player on & off. I finally decided to swap HDMI cables with good ones I had and knew worked well and the problem has completely gone away. Glad I didn't return the Blu-Ray player. Beware, quality is spotty."
5,Jerry,"I thought that the price of .01 was a typo. Nope, that's it plus shipping. Does just what a HDMI cable is supposed to do for very little expense."
1,Very low price reflected in quality of cables,"I purchases these cables because of their low price. However i would have been better off with a more expensive HDMI cable that actually functioned. After several days of use, connected from my amplifier to my television, the picture would blink in and out until completely failing. A waste a my money, i will be buying a new cable from a better brand."
1,Did not work,"Did not work when connected directly to the TV from a Roku or XBox 360. Not going to cry about it b/c of the price, but if you're trying it for either of those devices don't bother."
2,Not a wise purchase,"The overwhelming majority of the book's 110 pages is taken up by scripture passages (which we already have access to) and blank lines for recording reflections and answers to the study questions. This study has very little in the way of actual content, instead focusing on asking sunday school style questions. The book never actually answers any of the questions or provides deeper insight, meaning that there is little to learn from this study except the thoughts that you and your study group are able to produce. For those hoping for an in-depth look at Romans that will guide you into deeper, more thorough understanding of scripture, look elsewhere. This book is a waste of your time, energy and money."
4,Great!,"This is very simple: if you want to hear great honky-tonk country music, buy this CD, and all the rest of Mark Chesnutt's music."
5,Friend of a Friend,"There are few potty training books available and even fewer that are as engaging and endearing as this lil gem. For the adult who is purchasing it on behalf a child, it will bring them back to a simplier and sweeter time. For the child who is bestowed this book it will bring them education and maybe, perhaps even more importantly, entertainment."
3,Not really,"Its hard to review kids books. What one child likes, another might not. My kid did not really respond to this book at all, nor to the CD. Oh well."
5,"awesome, easy program","I am by no means computer or software literate. This program has wonderful lessons, plus video helps! I would highly recommend it to any level quilter. Don't see how you could possibly go wrong."
4,Electric Quilt 6,I have just started following the lessons in the manual and it is very easy to follow.
2,Not a Fan of EQ,"I know many others like this program, I for one feel it is not user friendly. It is not easy to begin with, and the manual does not support the users ability to look up and find a specific item they need to address. The lessons are structured in a step by step process that does not allow the user to interpolate onto their specific need. There are a total of 4 only 4 activations on different computers, which means over the life of the program that if you upgrade computers frequently, you will be paying for additional activations EVEN if you experience a computer crash. Their yahoo group doesn't seem to be helpful at all, and I do realize that it is not a part of the EQ network. Even activation initially was a hassle. Wish I had kept my money and found something else."
2,Not So Good Software,"The most valuable thing in this software is the calculation of yardage. Otherwise, the drawing/tracing tools are difficult and inadequate and it's too difficult to import scanned images to add your own fabric to your sketchbook. Overall a clumsy software."
4,Very nice band!,CSS is a very nice band. This brazilian band created their own style different from the brazilian traditional rock. A great addition to my collection. I strongly recommend them.
4,Pretty Good Album,The CSS album has great transitions from song to song and the majority of it makes great dance music.
4,Good Music All Around,"All in all this was a fun CD to listen to. CSS doesn't really take themselves or their music too seriously, which is refreshing. Some of the songs sounded similar to one another, but all in all it is is a CD that is really fun to listen to."
4,lets make digital 21st. century punkfunk,"This sound is an interesting mix that reminds me of the post punkers Bush Tetras from my home town NYC in the early eighties, as well as Tom Tom Club in mid-eighties (I always mix in these bands wth CSS along with Sigue Sigue Sputnik, but CSS have successfully managed to transecend that sound with a new millenium energetic fulgent space-race sound that electrofunk's its way to my deejay playlist always these daze. Bravo. Love this album, love these girls and love Brazil!!!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,This collar is crap and beyond ugly-- i didn't even put it on my dog. Nothing like the bright cheery picture-- more like a dirty red with dirty rusty bells. yuck.
5,Great flashlight,"This thing is as bright as my 6D cell MagLite and it fits in my pocket. I carry it arround daily and get great LPB (Light Per Battery). I even used my old batteries that wouldn't turn on my other flashlights and got two solid weeks of use out of them with this flashlight. The strobe function isn't as fast as my Blackhawk Gladius but it does the trick as far as signaling goes. I will probably buy another one soon for my wife to carry in her purse, right now she has my Surefire G2, but I think it is time to upgrade."
4,A pleasure to read...,"I totally disagree with gafield@dimellashaffer as I found this book interesting and enthrawling. As an aspiring ballet teacher I was deeply captivated by Deborah Bull's intelligence and maturity. She shows that ballet dancers need to be intelligent people (contrary to popular belief). The period of time that this book was written was a particulary crucial moment in the history of ballet in not only London, but all over the world and I found her telling of this trying time facinating and captivating."
2,dancing where?,I found this book very dull and a chore to read. I have read serveral books by dancers that have had me enthralled about the experience of dancing for a living. Bull seems to lack the fervor typically expected from someone is a field renowned for heartfelt passion.
1,Not great,Looked much cheaper than the photo on the website. Primarily colored plastic when I was looking for a higher quality bedside clock. Returned it.
4,quiet clock,"The clock is very quiet, which was what I was searching for. It's very in the front attractive as well. The only disappointment is that the back of the clock looks a little cheap given the price of the clock."
3,Plastic not metallic,Nice alarm clock but metallic case doesn't mean metal and thats what I was looking for. Simple and easy to use.
1,Do Not buy this clock - nothing good about it,Yes the clock is plastic with silvered coating - which isn't the greatest - the real problem is the part that lights up is about the circumference of a quarter in the middle of the clock face. Try telling time in the middle of the night when you can't tell the hour hand from the minute hand. And who the heck needs a second hand on a bedside clock? Also the second hand makes a faint ticking noise. Keep looking...
4,good deal,"I'm very pleased with this clock. Although not expensive, it's looks as if it is. The alarm gradually gets louder and uses alternating types of beeps to wake you up. They do the job but don't jangle your nerves first thing in the morning. Simple to set the time and the alarm time. Very pleased with this product."
3,a pleasant trifle!,"Dittersdorf, a contemporary of Mozart, started out by composing 9 Italian language comic operas of which this is one. Later on he composed German language Singspiels for which he is primarily known. This opera has very accessible but simple music. It receives a ""pleasant"" performance from its cast of 4 and chamber orchestra. However it is fairly expensive and there are so many great operas now available on video that, unless you are a collector like me, spend your money elswhere!"
3,"Well done, but incomplete","The introduction is excellent and translation is well done, however the book is incomplete - it offers only a tiny sampling of Ptolemy's geography (only the book concerning Gaul), which may disappoint some (I was certainly surprised, expecting to see a full translation)."
5,What a Cool Truck!,"I purchased this for my 4 yr old car & truck enthusiast because of the good reviews I read & a great sale price. He loves it! What a neat idea in design, perfect for creativity based on a love for trucks & construction. The different cable combinations are great for independent thinking. It kept his busy fingers out of trouble all morning (well almost) & we played with it on his bed right before nap time. Batteries included, how nice. Fast shipping from Amazon.com & a nice surprise for my son to find a package for him on the door step."
4,My son loves it!,My 4 year old loves this toy. Lots of different parts with endless combinations. Really encourages creativity! Excellent toy.
4,A very good movie!,"When two over-talented musicians meet they don't always do great stuffs...but here they do!The music is like a long dark trip in a boosted crimson court.Ok the singing-the whispering-is quite weird at first, but it really is like a narrator softly inviting you to follow the music stream, and taking you deeper and further into Bozzio's twisted brain(that guy is a martian!).Think about it as a Lynch or Cronenberg or horror movie soundtrack.Don't miss the opening, don't turn it off before the end!"
2,missed opportunity,"Musically this disc is actually good.I've always liked Bozzio.The problem here is the spoken-word vocals.It ends up sounding like a rock version of hip-hop.If there were no vocals and maybe some guest musicians this could be really good.I've tried to listen to this and just ignore the vocals , but it's difficult because they are way up in the mix.The drumming is excellent as usual and Sheehan also is very good, but overall the musicianship can't make up for the mix or the overbearing talk-vocals.Next time hire a singer who can add another musical element,rather than detract from some good ideas and rhythm work."
3,Should have been all instrumental,"Sadly, Terry Bozzio makes the mistake that many talented players make when doing their own albums; he opens his yap. The playing and production on the album is first rate, as would be expected from these two, but the songwriting and vocalizing (it can't really be called singing) is mediocre at best. Nevertheless there are a few tracks that are fairly listenable and if you're in the right frame of mind the album might grow on you. Were I to do it again, I'd just download ""Finger Painting"" and ""Sub Continent"", enjoy the sound of two incredible instrumentalists, and be done with it."
1,Nine Short Films,"Unfortunately, the ""singing"" is needed to add melody to an otherwise monotinous album. Nevertheless, very, very nice chops.I couldn't listen to more than four songs."
4,Great TV,"I don't have a lot of space, so i was looking for something small. This wasn't it....(it does measure 30 inches from side to side) I wanted to get one of those nice slim flat panel TVs, but those are way too much. You get your bang for the buck with this, a big huge flat sreen with 3 picture modes, a very easy to use input toggle (you can toggle between DVD, VCR, Video game system), most importantly it blows my 13 inch miles away! This is a great step foward for people who want a new 'modern' TV but can't really part with too much cash for a flat panel."
2,An unpleasant surprise.,"I bought this model a year and a half ago, and it worked fine, until one day (After the 1-year warranty expired) for no apparent reason those horizontal green lines appeared, and the picture lost a lot of its quality. This TV is still practically new. Not happy."
1,Do not purchase this TV by mail!,"I purchased this televison which arrived damaged. The casing on top of the unit was cracked, and it did not operate at all. I assume it was dropped during shipping. Amazon was great doing the exchange to a new one, but we are having problems with the new one as well. There are green horizontal lines across the screen, and the ports on the front for video games do not work properly. This all started about three weeks after it arrived. Since I threw the huge box away after 2 weeks of ownership, I can not exchange it again. I have to call Sony for repair service. I do not recommend this Television."
1,picture tubes bites dust in 14 months,"i was very pleased with this tv for the whole 14 months that it lived before dying of a bad picture tube. apparently this is a common problem with this tv but sony declines to acknowledge it or treat it as a situation deserving of recall status. of course i had chosen to go with sony because of their great reputation, but now i will steer clear of sony products in the future. think twice, then think again."
5,Juan Valdez JVPM1W Pod Coffee Brewing System,Very pleased with product. The price is excellant. The only thing that I was not pleased with was the free 90 pods. All were flavored Hazelnut which were great if you drank flavored coffee.I would recommend this item for performance and price as compared to some of the other coffee makers for pods.
5,2+ years and going strong,I just came on to order this as a gift for someone. I've had mine for about two and a half years and still thinks it's the best thing out there. I went to upgrade and looked at some of the $200+ models and didnt't find one I liked more....
5,More then expected,"Ordered the product on monday, received it on Tuesday night (YEA Amazon Prime) To my surprise I did not get 90 pods of hazelnut; instead it was a good variety of different blends (Dark, Light, Decaf, Hazelnut)I was able to brew my first cup in under 5min, from unpacking it, cleaning it, reading the instruction (a little) and brewing.I decided to go for the Dark and brew 8 oz, and to my surprise it actually looked like coffee, nice and dark, and not like tea :) and it looked to be about 8oz of liquid.And it tasted good too. At this price I would say it was a great deal (I actually ordered 2).And after hunting around for prices for pods I would say that it would be cheaper to just order this combo again instead of buying the pods separately, you can always put one on your desk at work or in the bedroom :)"
1,Died within 3 weeks!!,"This is quite possibly the worst purchase I have ever made. It really wasn't a very good coffeemaker to begin with and it completely died after 3 weeks. just woke up one morning and went to make coffee, Nothing...NOTHING!! no electrical activity what so ever."
1,Bait and switch Advertising,"You are promised 90 free coffee pods with this machine in this ad, and they ship the machine without any pods and refuse to send the product as advertised. Then they shift the blame to Amazon for running a faulty ad. I have the emails from their representatives stating such... BEWARE!! There are no free coffee pods. However the coffee machine works great. (you cannot return it if it has been used.)Juan Valdez JVPM1W Pod Coffee Brewing System with 90 Free Coffee Pods"
3,Purchased thru Amazon It leaks water,"The unit is ideal for the ""one cup"" coffee drinker and it does fit most coffee pods however the unit leaks water. I must empty the water tank after each use or it will leak. However the instructions advises that if you leave the tank dry for several days you have to prime the unit again before use. I feel there is a flaw in the system."
3,review of juan valdez 1 pod brewing system,"I would have liked to have been able to purchase another color. Also, the price was a little high, but other than that it works fine."
1,Inferior product,Did not recieve 90 free coffee pods as advertised. Coffee maker does not make a full 12 oz cup of coffee on makes 6 oz the you have to hit the brew button again to get the other 6 oz. Overall this product is not worth 5.00.
1,IT'S A LIE,Coffee pods do not come with the brewer. Huge lie. Amazon needs to clarify this immediately. Waste of time and money.
1,Don't do it,"Don't even think of wasting your money on this CD--it's a complete ripoff. These recordings may be by the original artists, but they sure ain't the original recordings. They stink!"
2,wasnt all the orginally music,i liked the songs on the cd but they werent all the original singers i have some of the original hits and u could definitely tell the difference
3,WHY DID THEY LEAVE OFF THE BEST TRACK?,"I appreciate the fact that M & C were able to fit a two album recording on one CD Rom, but frankly would rather have paid the extra money to have two CDs that include my favourite song: Peter Kagan and the Wind. I used to own the the double album in vinyl and love every song. If you don't know them, I guess you won't know what you are missing. However, I would still recommend going on e-bay to find the original album, if you are old and sad enough (like me) to have a turntable. Or maybe we could all write to the music publishers to complain?"
1,"5 stars for the original, 1 star for the reissue","It is a real shame that the record company did not re-release some of the best material from this concert. I have a cassette tape copy, and it is a great treat to listen to it. The quality of the music is top-notch, and the on stage bater is priceless. This is what reunited Makem and Clancy together again! If you can, search e-bay for a cassette or an LP, don't waste your money on this botched reissue."
3,might work for some couples,"The book give's you all the tools you need to refiew your marriage and refine your marriage in the military. However it only works if non of the partners is in denial about problems and both partners are interested in the book and changing their relationship.Well, I think if you are the right kind of couple it even is a good help if you are not in the military."
4,good stuff,i got this for my flying squirrel because of his calcium defenses and its great i tryed the spray before but it smelled funny and he would not eat it i tried this because it was recomended by a breeder he takes it good whit his fav food the only resone i gave it 4 stars it because he can still figer out that its on the food the tries to rub it off but still gets what he needs cuz hes no longer having sesures
4,Take them for a little while,"In 2001, three members of the VANILLA FUDGE got together and proved they can still rock & roll-- these guys sound terrific! THE RETURN features reworkings of eight of their classics-- all are excellent. ""Season Of The Witch,"" for example, is vastly improved by the loss of Mark Stein's odd poetry break midway through (""Here we sit emerged in a liquid sea of love..."" etc.), as well as a truncation of the intro. The new studio version of ""Shotgun"" is white-hot and most welcome.Carmine Appice is still amazing-- the man hasn't lost a beat. Vocals on ""Need Love"" soar high, while the Fudge's jamming surpasses their original track. The four new songs on this set are quite good, too. This album's a joy-- if you're a Vanilla Fudge fan, you're gonna love it!TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 75:17"
3,"Oh, please...","Im not a kid. But I know a kid who owns this gun. It's not very accurate, shoots okay, though. He had to disassemble it then tape it back together to keep it working. I wouldn't buy it unless i had to."
1,BREAKS TOO EASILY!!!!!!,this gun holds TONS OF BULLETS is SUPER POWERFUL but will break within a month
5,John Stewart's best!,"I ran across this CD in a second-hand store. I had never heard of it before. It's now my favorite John Stewart CD. Full of catchy hooks and clever arrangements. Probably not the best CD if you are a feminist, but if you are, you probably aren't a John Stewart fan anyway. Give it a try."
5,Outstanding Performance by Miss Eudora Welty!!!,"This legendary writer does full justice to her classic short stories with thoroughly delightful readings!! This lady is not only a supremely gifted comic writer, she is a fabulous comedienne performer, giving delicious readings no veteran Hollywood or stage actress could match. She will have you on the floor with WHY I LIVE AT THE P.O. and especially THE PETRIFIED MAN. This is one book on tape you will play over and over. This one should have won a Grammy for Best Spoken Recording. Miss Welty is a laugh riot! This old gal is funnier than Lucille Ball!!!"
2,Fast Talk for a Southerner,"While I love reading Eudora Welty stories in print form, I was highly disappointed with the tape. Ms. Welty reads so fast it took me half of the first story to begin to be able to follow her. Having lived in the deep south, I was used to people down there telling me, a native northerner, to slow down. Ms. Welty turns the tables with this tape. If you are able to play the tape at a reduced speed, you should enjoy her rich characterizations and storylines."
3,Solid but not amazing,"You'd think that a band made up of members from the Meat Puppets, Nirvana and Sublime would be amazing; but like many ""supergroup"" attempts this band falls short of the accomplishments and originality of the other bands that the members had come from. There are some great tracks here but nothing that will blow you away. ""Telescope"" is probably the best track.. mainly because it wakes you up from the softer beginning to the record. ""Slight of Hand"", ""Alaska"" and ""What I Said"" are worth hearing a few times. Buy this record if you are a truely huge fan of Nirvana or Meat Puppets.. there's not much Sublime influence on this one."
4,Fantastic,"When you listen to this album, you can definitely pick out the Seattle sound. With Krist Novoselic and Curt Kirkwood on vocals and former Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh on the kit, it's unfortunate that this album wasn't released 10 years earlier. But then of course, that would have taken us back to when Nirvana and the Meatpuppets were in their prime.A great album to play all the way through on a rainy day."
1,The big lie,"I don't know who the rest of these people are but this records is awful. I was so excited as I am a huge Meat Puppets fan. I have never been more disappointed in a record in my life. At best this record sounds like late commercial Soul Asylum. At worst it sounds like dying wildebeests. The third track ""Inquiring Minds"" should get the band arrested. I played it for a friend as a prank it is so bad.Instead of buying this record, drag your knuckles against a brick wall until the bone is exposed."
2,Universal Soldier2 doesn't cut it.,"This was supposed to be part 2 of the original Universal Soldier with Jean Claude returning as the hero. Note that there was already a low budget knock off of #2 and #3 previously released without Jean Claude. Unfortunately, this low-budget sequel had none of the ambiance or realism that the original movie contained. In fact, if not for the title, you would not have known that this was the second part. Nothing from this movie linked the first movie (except for an occasional flash back). The weapons and outfits were poor. The premise was weak and and the special effects were either poor (as in bullets bouncing off car windows) or non existent. The only thing that carried over from the last movie (and all his other movies) was Jean Claude getting beatup through-out the movie in spite of the fact that he was supposed to be a ""Universal Soldier"" hinself. We were are pretty dissappointed with this one. It was a comedic ripoff of a good film."
1,Made the Original one look entertaining!,"I have to admit. I just wanted to see Goldberg! After his brilliant (?) performance with Kevin Nash on the Love Boat, it seemed like it would be quite a stretch to see him perform as an out-of-control killing machine. This movie is just awful, Van-Damme is terrible - and the plot is ridiculous. The computer terminal takes over and materializes into a soldier? That sure makes sense. Watch Nitro instead - at least Goldberg wins there and that's more believable!!"
2,Short running time causes sequel to go down in ashes,"""Universal Soldier"" was a half decent action film and one of Van Damme's first half decent pictures. This sequel was a good idea for Van Damme, as he is starting to head back into straight to video territory. The sequel is pretty much a rehash of the original, except it's not as interesting and it is too damn short, just as it starts to get going it ends. Luc Devearaux (Van Damme) use to be a UniSol (as they nickname them) and now he is forced to take on the new breed, who get out of control. There's Seth (Michael Jai White)and Romeo (Bill Goldberg) posing the biggest threat. some action scenes in this are quite good, especially the opening one where there is a cool speedboat chase. But I ask myself, why wouldn't original co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Ally Walker, Ed O'Ross or Jerry Orbach want to do the sequel? it must have been a dodgy script. Action fans may find something of interest here. may I say."
2,Why did they bother.....,"I am a Van Damme fan and still hold out for the day when he makes a return to the big screen. I bought this recently and now wish I hadn't. Unfortunatly with this entry it seems Van Damme has decided to self-destruct what remains of his career. I hope he made this during his drug addiction years, if not, then I think he has received one to many kicks to the head and should consult a doctor. Very predictable throughout which by no means is a bad thing if only the film was enjoyable and didn't treat its audience as if they were 10 year olds. Logic seems to have been thrown out the window along with the two page script. Rent this before parting with your hard earned cash if only to see the fight scene in the lapdancing club! Van Damme has shown some glimmer of hope with Desert Heat and Replicant but I think the good old days of Kickboxer, Timecop, Universal Soldier and Sudden Death are long over."
2,Universal Soldier 2 was HORRIBLE!!!,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was very dissapointing, for me being a big fan of Van Damm's and Goldberg's. Some great action, but unneeded nudity and thoughtless storylines make this a movie that does not need to be see. Get the first one."
5,yo,nice s*** music is definetly late in this season but son good lyrics in this song good beat by the producers and the haters
3,Not Bad........But,"At Most I enjoyed this movie, Bill Goldberg ( Romeo,UniSoldier) at his Grid Iron tackling Best, But the movie was spoilt by one of the female leads,(The TV News Anchor ) by her rather corny over-acting, But was more "" into it "" in the ending sequences, The movie Plot at the end of the movie got lost in hyper drive, as the 2nd female lead that was looking after Luc Deveraux's Daughter at the hospital and suddenly appeared at the end of the movie as a uni soldier herself, Poor Plot line there :"
3,saw the movie at the theater ...,"there was a short recall of some scenes from the original universal soldier movie to connect to this sequel, but not enough background on the events that led to luc devereaux's wedding and becoming a father. i think the newsreporter's character was a waste of time in this movie since all she did was get in the way. the action was not lacking in this film though it could have used more of the humor from the original movie. i guess i expected a continuation of the original characters as the made for tv movies (universal soldier II & III) did."
5,"Action, Action,and more van damme action!","Part 2 of universal soldier(universal soldier-the return)this movie is about one man fighting against tons of unisol soldiers, that are 2.5 times stronger then any man. The main computer goes out of control. I won't go into detail, cause i don't want to ruin the movie, but Jean-Claude Van Damme Pulls out some awsome martial arts foot action in this movie. The best fighting scene yet of jean claude is in this movie. This movie has some comedy scenes,as well as action. Bill goldberg does an outstanding job in this film. I just don't see how this didn't become a big hit in the movie theaters. I rent movies qite often and i think jean claude movie gets so underated. If you u were to pick out the latest top 10 movies, jean claude movie should be atleast a 3 on the top 10 list. so if you want a great hit, this movie is a must see."
2,Action good-Story bad,"It didn't follow the story line that the first two universal soldier movies had created. Even with that aside the story within the movie jumped around and at times was confusing.Now if you just want to see action - gunfire, explosions, hand-to-hand, this is your movie."
2,"[Two and a half stars out of five] Average from the word go; musclehead Bill Goldberg, the ex-Pro DLm ends his movie career here","I know, Goldy got another movie later,but here we see why he ISN'T THE next'Rock'. Supoorting cast is pretty badand belgian kickboxing Champ Van Damjust isn't Schwarzenegger (that saysa lot!) and movie night filming doesn'thelp! Props and fake US army set uplooks like something out of a Returnof the Living Dead set! Not really any-thing to right home about unless you'reinto Bill Goldberg, ""Next stop, intensivecare..."", just like Van Dam and B.G.'scareers after this movie. Can you beleiveVan Dam did (another) sequel?!"
2,"Stupid ""sequel"" fails for the most part...","This film marked the end of Van Damme's theatrical release career and started him on the road to being forgotten, finding parts in only direct-to-video flicks. It's a shame, really. Van Damme was actually getting good, but this flick doesn't show it. Full of cliches and silly action, not helped by an appearence from wrestler Bill Goldberg, this film is too short to pick up any real momentum, and too stupid to give the viewers anything more than a childish plot. I give it a two simply because it was watchable. I'm being very nice."
1,Awful.Just awful.,"Well,I've given every other one of Van Damme's movies a try,so I thought,with a little bit more apprehension than usual,how about this one.Well,I wish I had trusted my instincts and not gone near it with a bargepole,for this film simply took the biscuit.Universal Soldier:The Return is a mind bogglingly awful disaster,full of atrocious acting,utter predictability,cardboard characters,dated action,laughable special effects and boring martial arts.It's blissfully short,but sadly,it's so dire,it feels like it's going on forever,thanks mainly to stuntman turned director Mic Rodgers's unprofessional direction.And it's kind of freakyish how Jean Claude Van Damme was programmed mechanically in the first film,but now just seems to have returned back from the dead Frankenstein style here.For every reason imaginable,one to steer well clear from."
4,very entertaining movie,"I cannot believe this movie is getting such low reviews as i enjoyed it as did everyone that i know did aswell.this movie was mostly fast paced action and excellent fight scenes with scary villans, not much about the story as the first one but it was also funny like when van-damme says ""i'm leaving, no violence"" then he beats the beats the bouncers up. overall the movie was very entertaining and i think the flaws was the movie's lower budget and lack of creative stunts & locations. but if your a van-damma or action movie fan you will enjoy it."
1,UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: PLEASE DON'T RETURN !,"Holrrible. Van Damme lost its way forever. It's luck for him and the producers that there atill are Van Damme's die-hard fans all around the world, so he can keep releasing this low-budget trashes and still makes money!"
5,A great movie!,As good or maybe better than Universal soldier. A great and entertaining action movie. I think everybody will love this movie!
3,Universal soldier2:the return,This is a movie to see once.It has great action but it is missing something.Luc Deveraux is trying to stop the controller of the soldiers.The soldier turn bad and whoever gets in their way to kill Luc will die.Jean-Claude Van Damme has great kicks and strong punhes.But if you like Jean-Claude Van Damme you might like this movie
1,Van Damme plays a tree !,"I brought this DVD thinking it would be pretty cool ! However, the movie will now join others in my DVD collection as one that I probably wont watch again EVER! This film just does not deliver, it has 'A-team' violence (loads of bullits flying and explosions but knowbody actualy getting hurt!) , stupid characters (most of them seem to have come from WWF or something) and I have to say Van Damme plays a block of wood, I also got the impression that I was watching Sunset beach or something with every simple aspect of the film being explained out for me, like the audience were retards. Its a 'watchable' film if you aint doing anything interesting but I wish I had not spent the money on buying it. Save your dosh and buy something cool."
4,"Good History, Fascinating Characters, Slightly Tedious","You probably couldn't find two more fascinating personalities in the history of cinema than Hitchcock and Selznick, and Mr. Leff does an excellent job providing background information and behind-the-scenes details on their collaborations. The book tends to slow down at times, mostly due to expositionary passages which are essential, but which delay getting to the good stuff.One thing I would have liked more of would have been more information on what each of these characters did away from each other. I realize that gets away from the main thesis, but I think that Mr. Leff tries to involve as many of those details as he can into his narrative but is forced to pare it down to stay on course.What's particularly interesting is how Hitchcock and Selznick virtually switched places in the Hollywood hierarchy over the course of their time together. Knowing what we know about each man in his later years lends an extra creedence to Mr. Leff's work."
4,Worth reading,"While this book deals with Robespierre from his birth, it concentrates on his time of fame. He comes off as a most unlikeable man, and I found it hard to disagree with the picture, based as it is on solid research. Robespierre was notorious for denying a trial to people before they were executed, but it is sobering to realize that the seventy-some people executed in connection with Robespierre's fall also were denied a trial!"
2,"Unlikely plot, likeable characters","This book has some sweet and mildly interesting characters, but its plot borders on the ridiculous. A rather hip and apparently super-agile and -fit 65-year-old woman gets herself into unlikely situations for even a youngster, let alone an elderly mystery-solver. Add to that the ""evil"" cult which has moved into a small fictitious Vermont town and the rather silly and far-fetched goings-on leading up to an anticlimactic jumble at the end, and you have a very light, almost comical read that may be suitable for an afternoon at the beach, and I will admit that it kept me at least mildly entertained. However, the shocking number of typos and grammatical errors in the copy of the book I had were thoroughly distracting and disappointing."
5,Candy-Coated Melancholy,"A soundscape built from vintage instrumentation with nods (e.g. minimal drum machine beats and a charmingly postmodern, self-mocking lyrical sense) to modernity. A popular combination these days, to be sure, but this is a stellar manifestation of the trend. The dusky, moody harmonies of Here Comes Winter call to mind a slow dance in taffetta in a humid high school gym circa 1956. Noon's transmittal-from-a-distant-star vocals ground the album in spooky, lonesome beauty."
1,Are you serious?,Seriously! This is pretty ridiculous. Unless you live in a place without a decent grocery store this is a complete rip off! You can buy all these items for likely under $20 at World Market.
1,What's happened?,"I never thought I would live to see the day that the Ryche started grasping at straws. Instead of the well-crafted songs and stellar musicianship I have come to expect, all I hear is a bunch of industrial noise. I don't blame it on Chris DeGarmo's departure (""Hear In The Now Frontier"" wasn't that great either), but on someone's misguided notions about ""what the kids will listen to."" C'mon, you guys, you can do better than this!"
5,empire,"It has been arrived on time that mentioned , and it has been packaged very good . although I am ok with bonus tracks ."
1,At least its not Rap,Please put out an A.P.B. for Chris DeGarmo. This band is the reason I began to play guitar in the early 80s and I want to know what happened. I got married like these guys but my guitar work and songwriting capability hasn't become muddy and undestinguishable. What happened to the solo work and the heart wrenching vocals of old? Queensryche has become just like the other horrible bands that have come out of Seattle. Maybe they need to get out of the rain. You can't believe how disappointed I was when this long awaited CD came to me in the mail. The only good comment I can make is at least it's not Rap.
1,Queensryche - Q2k: What the...?,"Since the release of Empire (1990), Queensryche's ability to write great songs has somehow been lost. No surprise, really, considering their best songwriter, Chris DeGarmo, left the band before Q2k was written. Yes, Queensryche's last two albums with Chris weren't exactly great but at least they were decent. Chris's absence shows. Q2k is, in my opinion, an awful album. It is just awful songwriting."
1,This CD did not meet my expectations!,The common thread that runs through the reviews of this CD by people who were less than satisfied is that Chris leaving the band was a bad thing and that QR needs to return to the writing style that built their fan base in the first place.It must be harder to write good songs than I thought - the last 3 CDs have all been a disappointment.
3,"Not the greatest they have put out, but still ok","This disc severly lacks the ""singing guitars"" and the melody found on their previous works. Basically, this album is just a bunch of hard hitting riffs, and most of them do sound good. ""Sacred Ground"" and ""Breakdown"" are great songs, as is ""Right Side"". The problem is that songs that lack melody don't last long and grow tiresome pretty quickly. If you already have a bunch of Queensryche's stuff, this disc is worth picking up. If you are a first time buyer, pick up ""Empire"" and ""Operation: Mindcrime"" first to appreaciate what this band really has to offer. Hopefully, they will start putting together more material that has more to it than this (if they stay together)."
2,Uhhh,"Man what happened? Where is the feeling, the energy, the strong meaningful lyrics? I remember when these guys made a statement and drove it home."
4,Get in front of a decent sound system and open up your brain,"I can't belive all the crap I am hearing about a whole CD worth of the best metal song arrangements to come down in a long time. You need to give it a few more spins, get out of the 80's and your tin can car system. If you're not getting it, you are not listening. I'll be in Vegas Oct 30th if you need more instruction-Darren. By the way I've been listening to these guys for 12 years and am evolving every day, are you. You may want to take a close look. I love Chris's work, but Kelly Gray is the ****!"
3,Ages well...,"Back when Q2K was originally released, I would have rated it two stars. With the passage of time, I see it as a stronger, though by no means great, album and have given it three stars. It has some good tracks, including ""Falling Down,"" ""Sacred Ground,"" ""Liquid Sky,"" and the fantastic ""Right Side of My Mind."" It also has some terrible tracks (""Wot Kinda Man"" indeed). Just prior to Q2K, the band had lost it's label and it is clear they were on a downhill slide artistically. The departure of Chris DeGarmo did not help matters in any way, shape or form. They've continued to struggle, though their recent Operation Mindcrime 2 is their best album since ""Promised Land.""2006 REISSUE: Given the fact Q2K was out of print, it's great that this remastered version has been released, (though it is likely it didn't really need to be remastered). The two bonus tracks are quite good, and I'm frankly astonished they weren't included on the original release. It would have benefitted from their inclusion."
2,What happened to the great mind inspiring band of all time?,"I have been a ryche fan since I first saw them as an opening band. The music mad you feel something when you listened to it. The last two cd's just don't do it anymore. It's almost like they are trying to hard. Maybe it's the pressures from record contracts or they feel their popularity falling. They need to remember where they came from and who got them there. I usually buy there cd's without listening first. They are the only band I will ever do that for. There have been so many times when their music was the only thing that made sense, and kept me going. I'm dissapointed ,but I still think they are the best all time band ever. I like Rage For Order the best and hope they can get it together."
4,No Degarmo - No problem!,"To be completely honest with you - yes - there is something missing on this album. It isn't the Queensryche some have grown to love - and it isn't the Queensryche that some have grown to hate. With Degarmo leaving the band, he took something with him. But what he took, Queensryche has replaced with something fresh, new, and absolutely riveting. Enter Kelly Grey. Bluesy, cutting edge, and not afraid to shove a lick down your throat. I love his style, and I love what he has brought to the band. ""One Life"" is an instant Queensryche classic. ""When the Rain Comes"" is a brilliantly written song. Geoff sounds great on that one. ""Sacred Ground"" - one word - groovy.If you're looking for old school Queensryche - don't look here. No more Bruce Dickenson-ish singing from Geoff, and no more whining guitars. Queensryche has officially established themselves as a multi decade band. Something only few rock bands have ever done.More power to you, Queensryche - don't stop trying for change."
5,I am Q2K Compliant! Are you?,"I have been addicted to this album since the day I bought it. It's so refreshing to hear GOOD music these days amidst all the trash out there right now. It's not as good as Promised Land, but still a fantastic, energetic album!"
4,A solid effort from a brilliant band,"If you are purchasing thid cd expecting to hear ""Rage"" or ""Mindcrime""...don't. Do expect to hear a solid album from a group that just replaced one of its most creative members (Chris Degarmo). There are songs on here that can hold their own with any song on ""Promised Land"" or ""HITNF"" and anyone who would stop liking this great group due to this album needs to get a clue! (better yet, go listen to some Kid Rock!!)"
2,Not Again...,"I'm listening to the CD right now as I'm typing, and its droning music and whining lyrics might as well be white noise. Another disappointing album. None of the songs are remarkable. I defy anyone to remember any of the choruses or hooks three hours later. Terrible. While bands like Savatage and Dream Theater seem to be getting better as they get older, Queensryche has fallen apart more and more since Mindcrime. Everyone, do yourself a favor and pick up ""Dead Winter Dead"" or ""Wake of Magellan"" from Savatage -- that's the kind of music Queensryche should be putting out these days, instead of this sleep-inducing stuff."
1,Heed the Warnings: This CD is one of their worst.,"QR is a band with an exceptional career and legendary albums. _Operation: Mindcrime_ was a stunning and powerful masterpiece, _Empire_ represented some of the smoothest rock I've ever heard, and _Promised Land_ showed off the band's diversity in a way few others could match. So why have the last two albumbs been soooooooo bad? Gone is the sentiment, storytelling, and perfect blending of vocals and instruments. Vanished is the powerful emotion behind each song which super-charged the listener. What is left are childish songs like ""Sacred Ground"" which only leave the fans disgusted by a group that used to have such incredible talent. The band can no longer hear the revolution calling nor the cries of their fans over the sound of the garbage they now call music."
3,Not Nearly As Bad As People Say,"I Think They Should Have Wiated More Than 2 YearsAfter Hear In The Now Frontier This Could HAve Been Less Ordinary (It Is Still Better Than Promise Land Though..Im Sorry I Know Ryke Fans Worship That Album But It's Just too Slow For Me)Takes A bit To Get Going But Any Song After Breakdown Is Just As Good As Other Ryke Songs, Wouldnt Reccomend It For Newer Ryke Fans Try Mindcrime Or Warning"
3,Q2K,"Out of the 4 albums that sucked most for QR, this is the best one. The problem is that the songs are just OK. It's not a snooze fest like Promised Land, doesn't try to be alternative like HITNF, nor does it flat out suck like Tribe. You can hear that the band is trying to get back to heavier material. Degarmo's replacement just wasn't good enough to be in this band and I think that has a lot to do with how this album suffers. I saw them on tour at The House of Blues for this album and they only played 2 songs off of it. There's a reason for that. Fortunatly, they had some saving grace with Mindcrime 2."
4,Hard hitting and thoughtful,"This is a welcome album after the stagnant last album(IMHO). Underplayed leads(which were incredible live BTW) and solid writing. Very refreshing...Do not expect DeGarmo's playing(which was not inspired on the last album anyways). I like it! New guitarist is very talented but not quite integrated into the sound of the band(thats more of a live review, tho)."
2,unsure,"I have been a fan of QUEENSRYCHE since I heard them in 1983. I have enjoyed all their albums, especially their earlier ones. I think that each one of the band members has a special talent that adds to the magic of their music. This latest seems to miss one thing, Chris DeGarmo. I am sad that he is no longer with the band. I hope that Kelly Thompson can fill Chris' big shoes left behind. Sincerely-Dani Francis(Mike's wife)"
1,This CD will disappoint true QR fans,"Probably the worst QR album made. I bought the album without seeing or hearing any sales hype, so no ""over the top"" expectations were set. But after the first listen, it was VERY apparent that Chris DeGarmo had left the band. Not only did Chris give QR their definitive sound, but also helped push Geoff Tate into writing and producing some great lyrics. The music on this CD are below QR standard, relying heavily on long, stale grooves that seem to never start, stop or climax. No solos, no hard riffs that imprint memories ....nothing. By the third song you realize that Geoff may still have those golden pipes, but his lyrics really need substantial help. Not only can you predict his next line, but can forcast what the bridge will be for almost EVERY song on this album. Is this the end for one of my Favorite bands? Lets hope not......."
1,Disappointing!,This album was a huge disappointment. No inspiration. It sounds as if they were trying to finish out a contract that they weren't happy with. I sold this one back for half price.
3,Still Strong,"Anyone who wondered:""What would Queensryche sound like without original guitarist and main songwriter Chris DeGarmo?"" gets their answer. And that answer is(not surprisingly):they sound like Queensryche, albeit a less experimental version. In replacing DeGarmo with Kelly Gray, the band returns to its more ""Empire"" oriented hard rock roots. The opening ""Falling Down"" could easily be from that album, as could the dream-like vibe of ""Right Side Of My Mind."" Gray and remaining gutarist Michael Wilton cook up a bunch of catchy, meaty riffs on ""Breakdown"" and ""Wot Kinda Man."" Forrays into sublime mellowness, like ""Beside You,"" plus unnecessary overproduction(mainly on Geoff Tate's powerful voice) take some of the wind out of a record that shows Queensryche aren't done yet."
3,Better than HiTNF,"Eagerly anticipating their next effort. Why? Cause now that they've secured a contract they can get back to making the album that they MEANT Q2K to be(had to make sacrifices, looking for a new contract, it's called business as usual in musicland). And from what I heard, it's going to be quite a ride......."
2,This is Queensryche? What happened to them?,"I concur with the majority of people here who think this album bites. I've listened to everything Queensryche has put out since their EP days. The guitar work is boring, the lyrics dull or moronic, and the vocals are just plain flat! It's unbelievable that this is the same group that put out Mindcrime and Empire, albums that were musically and lyrically explosive. I used to tell people Queensryche was the ""thinking man's metal group"". After listening to Q2K, I don't even want to think about them anymore! C'mon guys, put out the music that everyone knows you're capable of!!"
2,I tried so hard to enjoy this CD!,"What the heck happened after ""Promised Land?"" This has been my favorite band for 10 years and I love them to death, but this album stinks almost as much as the last one..where are the soaring lyrics? Where is the emotion? Where is that crisp, heart-thumping rhythm? What happened to songs like ""Take hold of the flame"",""Eyes of a Stranger"", ""Empire"", ""Bridge""..I know they want to stay ""updated"" but at what cost? If you crave that ""old queensryche"" sound, check out an independent album--Inflagrante' Delecto."
2,Someone let them know...,"man, this album goes absolutely nowhere. it's even blander and less remarkable than HITNF. i didn't think that would be possible, to be honest. i was really hoping for a return to the glory days, a la the RFO through Empire days. while HITNF has its moments (""The Voice Inside"", ""You"", and ""Saved"" come to mind), this album has nothing worth mentioning. i played two or three times through the first day and that's it for me. i don't want to ""accept"" or ""learn"" to like the new QR. i want good, melodic hard rock. they just don't have it in them anymore, i guess. i mean, it sounds (and reads) like they spent an hour max working on the lyrics and arrangements. it's just five guys f***ing around in a studio, if you ask me. oh well, we'll always have those old gems. my last request to this band is this: please, please, please remaster O:M and RFO! they sound terrible by today's mastering standards. but i'll take 'em as is any day over this tripe..."
4,where's the musical expertise we once heard?,"Being a semi-pro musician who grew up idoilizing bands like Queensryche, Tesla, Mr. Big, Slaughter and other bands who could actually play and not just look good, the turn the last couple of Queensryche albulms have taken is a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong I like the albulm but.... I've heard it before! Queensryche to me was always the band who could pull off some of the most creative songs I've ever heard. This is starting to look like a ""black"" albulm or ""countdown to extinction"". Previous offerings had lots of technical, tempo changing, intelligent songs. This albulm has one too many songs about ""love"" and not a single tempo besides 4/4. ""Falling Down"" is by far the best song on there! The back bone is still there between Rockenfeild and Jackson and the groove is still there, not to mention Geoffs tamer but still excellent voice. This is what makes this band great but it seems like one too many other albulms are anymore...commercialized!"
2,Something's missing here . . . .,"At first after listening to new Qr clips online, a few plays of the album were thrilling, but only on a few songs, and even that didn't seem to last. Queensryche just doesn't seem to have that unique abstract energy that they once did. This album is Qr cheapened to a commercial level. It's sad really . . ."
4,Great to have the ryche back,"Been a fan since the EP. This is certainly a much better album than Hear in the now frontier. I read all the negative hype surrounding the release but was really pleasantly surprised with the finished product. Great production, nice pounding drums and choruses that stay with you. I miss Geoff's soaring howls but he does come out pretty cleanly on the disc. Good stuff here, enjoy and don't listen to the hype."
2,Not Much Substance,"Not a awful CD , but definitely lacks the substance of some of their earlier efforts, ie Promished Land. Just not the same without Chris Degarmo"
2,If you liked the last one...,"for some reason QR can't seem to write a catchy tune anymore, as displayed on the last two records. boring, plodding, standard metal. nothing special. dissapointed again."
4,MORE LATER...,"Well I went and bought it today... just like I said I would. Of course it needs more listens to (only twice thus far) but there are some things I'll tell anyone thats interested: It's different again. Not good different, not bad different, just different. Sort of how Empire was not the same as Promised Land which was not the same as Hear in the Now Fromtier which is not the same or may never be Mindcrime or Rage. The guitars seem real chunky and chuggy... if you can get a visual on that one. My first complaint here is where is Geoff's blaring, cut through a horn section tenor blasts? Lots of midrange singing, which is wonderful, but if you are a die-hard, you just love the wails of tunes like ""Spreading the Disease""... they don't seem to be there. The songs seem solid and it will have me back for another listen tonight. But if you were expecting Mindcrime again, think again. They have moved on again, which seems to be their now ever-steady M.O."
4,This is just Queensryche rockin like only they can.,"This album rocks. It takes a couple listens to get into it because it a very new sound for Queensryche. after 3 listens I love it. Highlights for me are Falling Down, How Could I, Liquid Sky, The Right Side of My Mind, but I like almost every song...........adam"
4,The Rebirth of Queensrche...,"After the weak and un-inspired ""Hear in the Now Frontier"" of 1997, Queensrche has returned with a deeper, harder sound on the 1999 release of Q2K.New guitarist Kelly Gray brings a bluesy, rough guitar sound into the band that melds well with Michael Wilton's crisp, clean guitar style. Geoff Tate sounds like the Tate of 1990, his voice holding a complete range of high and low notes, while drummer Scott Rockenfield and bassist Ed Jackson make strong performances.Highlights include: ""Falling Down"" - the first cut on Q2K which has a blazing dual guitar solo between Gray and Wilton, ""When the Rain Comes,"" a slower tune which showcases the best vocal performance by Tate in years and the mind-gripping ""Right Side of My Mind.""Unlike previous efforts, this album has no theme or concept. Queensrche returns to the rock/metal scene with an album of 11 individual, yet powerful rock songs and you can tell that unlike the last album, their heart and soul are in this one..."
5,"Q2K, An album showing a bands talent and growth","I was a huge Queensryche fan with the release of their EP and The Warning. My interest in them faded with their next few albums even though I now consider Mindcrime to be one of the best albums ever. I never gave any of their later work much of a chance, Promised Land and Q2K. I now feel these albums as well as Tribe make the EP and other albums of that era sound dated. I absolutely love the sound of Queensryche later material and look forward to the future of the band. I would definatly recommend this album to any true Queensryche fan. Have an open mind, dwell not on the past, but embrace the present."
3,"At least it's better than their ""Ear"" Album.","What happened to the complexities of the EP, Warning, Rage and Mindcrime? I went to the Q2K concert and I know Geoff Tate can still sing. I just wonder why he hasn't on the last couple of albums.If you want REAL Queensryche see my reviews below. (Opinions vary ... these are mine).EP 4 stars; Warning 5 stars; Rage for Order 5 stars; Operation: Mindcrime 5 stars; Empire 4 stars; Promised Land 4 stars; Hear in the Now Frontier 0 stars; Q2K 3 stars"
4,A NEW Queensryche is born!,"Q2k, the newest effort from the boys from Seattle, branches out in a new direction. With the loss of their chief songwriter Chris Degarmo I was't sure what to expect. Clearly the songs are different than what die-hard have come to expect: lush production, killer riffs, thinking-man lyrics. We don't get that on Q2k. This is a new Queensryche with obviously a different writing process and style. Don't get me wrong, this CD rocks. It would be very friendly to any new fan. With crushing groves found in Liquid Sky, Falling Down, Breakdown and Burning Man. When the Rain Comes shows a classic vocal performance from Geoff Tate. The band had rebounded with a new sound, a tight rhythm section and something for everyone to enjoy. Pick it up but don't expect a Mindcrime here."
3,Hmmm....still listening,"I wouldn't call this effort an outright disappointment, but I'm still trying to let it grow on me. Personally, I liked HITNF a bit better. Others who have posted on this site have stated otherwise. I agree that something is lacking without Degarmo."
4,WOW! THIS IS A MUST HEAR CD!,"FROM THE THUMPING DRUM BEAT OF ""FALLING DOWN"" TO THE MIND WARP OF ""RIGHT SIDE OF MY MIND"", THIS IS TRUE RYCHE MATERIAL! OLDER RYCHEAN FANS WILL LOVE ""SACRED GROUND AND ""BREAKDOWN"". IT IS MY FAVORITE RYCHE CD BY FAR!!"
1,GARBAGE!!!,"I eagerly awaited the new release from one of my favorite bands, & although I did not expect much (now that the brains behind Queensryche is gone - Chris Degarmo)I was shocked by how BAD this CD is!!! Just like the saying goes ""Every Dog has his Day"", Every Band has their day & Queensryche's day has come & Gone!"
2,STAY AWAY,"QUEESRYCHE FANS BEWARE,THIS IS A STINKO.IF YOUR LOOKING FOR ANOTHER EMPIRE OR EVEN HEAR IN THE NOW FRONTIER FORGET IT.THIS CD JUST DOES NOT GET IT.APARENTLY THE LOSS OF GUITAR PLAYER CHRIS DEGARMO WAS JUST TO MUCH FOR THEM.IF THIS IS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO GO,PLEASE BRING CHRIS BACK FAST."
1,Horrible! Queensryche is DONE!,"This is horrible. I was hoping they would have a return to form after the joke called HITNF, but I was wrong. What happened to good music? Did they forget how to write? These guys should hang it up, because they are well-done."
1,The Last Studio Release I Ever Bought From The Band,"I seem to remember one or possibly two passable songs off of this release but this pile largely picks up where Here In The Lame Frontier leaves off. To add insult to injury, Geoff Tate hired some hack named Kelly Grey to enable him to achieve his fiercely determined, meteoric plunge into the depths of banality. S2K, Sucksryche for the Nu-Millenium"
2,Chris De Garmo's songwriting is sorely missed here.,"The effort is somewhat lacking, to an extent, that it doesn't sound like The Ryche at all. If you want to hear classic QR, better get the older albums.I hate to say this, but we want Chris back."
1,Q2Krappppp!,"This is all but a joke. Being a Queensryche fan from the first EP in 1982, this all but completes their career for me. The only salvagable song is the last one (The Right Side of My Mind), and they would do far better in all aspects if they produced more material along this line. Maybe the tour with Maiden and Halford will give them a shot in the arm. I will give them one more shot, and if they reguriTATE the same grungy garbage, they won't get another cent from me. There's plenty of other good stuff being released (Dokken, Maiden, Fates Warning, Motley Crue, Dio, etc.) so if they can't cut it anymore, they should hit the golf course, for good. I really hope they can come back with a worthy next release, more identifiable of their sound, which is the reason they are where they are. If not, they can always tour with the Scorpions, or maybe even the Backstreet Boys :)......"
2,ouch!,"Well, I have had this cd for a year now. I thought I would give it time to grow on me, but it never did. Queensryche has really lost it. In the first song ""Falling Down"" one of the lines states: ""I can't even think of a word that rhymes"" I don't know what happened to the deep and thoughtful lyrics of the past, but they are obviously gone. Save yourself and your money!"
2,Below Average,"Another dissapointment here, when DeGarmo left so did the heart and soul of Queensryche. With the exception of 2 good songs the rest is very weak. I expected Wilton to shine now that it was his turn to step up, but it didn't happen. The guitars are very thin throughout, Kelly Gray does nothing here. His influence is questionable (remember Dokken's Shadowlife CD?) he produced it. Well, maybe some day DeGarmo will come back and save the mighty Ryche!"
3,Q2Krapppppp?????,"A very moderate effort for this once excellent band - worth having, but they need to return more to their roots. This format they've forced themselves into does not suit them well. It would be worthwhile for them to prove they can still put out music that represents what got them here, but still moving forward (i.e.RUSH), but that's what seperates good bands from great ones!!! Queensryche is just good."
2,They keep getting worse,"I'm sorry to say it but this was once my favorite band and Operation Mindcrime is probably the best cd ever, but I am really disappointed in Q2K.I can't blame the departure of Chris Degarmo cause HITNF was below par too. I think they should have hunted for a guitarist instead of going straight to Kelly. Most bands go with the flow of what is popular with today's youth instead of continuing to play what got them to where they are. This is what their fans want from them. Small changes are good but trying to please people with commercial pop tunes (which I consider a huge change) is wrong. I borrowed this cd thank god cause I won't buy it. This is to the guys of Queensryche, If you want to get back to the minchrime/empire days when you could do no wrong, don't be the norm. Make another cd like those because it can be done by you, but you have to want to. Don't lose your loyal fans by making any more Q2K's, go back to your roots. PLEASE!!!"
