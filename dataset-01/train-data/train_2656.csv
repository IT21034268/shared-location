5,Hollis Gillespie is hilarious and touching!,"I loved this book so much after I borrowed it from the library, that when I couldn't find her first book at any of my state interlibrary lenders, I bought it (from Amazon!). I love Hollis' writing style; she is hilarious and original but all of her tales end with a poignant thought. I'd never heard of her before I read a review of her books on Amazon and I'm so glad I found her. I love that each chapter in her books is a short, mostly true story and I wish I had wacky friends like hers. I hope she keeps writing more novels because I will be reading every last one of them, possibly more than once, and I don't usually re-read books. (Another author I just discovered who is just like Hollis, is Laurie Notaro...I'll be reviewing her books next!)"
5,Someone please give this girl a Pultzer Prize for writing.!!!!!,"Hollis Gillespie's second book might just be even better than her first one, if that's even possible. Her sassy way of words leaves me wanting MORE..Her characters Lary, Daniel & Grant are all certifiably crazy but with the best intentions. Hollywood needs to turn this book into a sitcom for HBO or Showtime. I love Hollis Gillespie, I love her style of writing and I have a feeling there will be more books to follow and if we are all lucky maybe we'll see Hollis's book turned into a Golden Globe award winning show for tv . Keep writing Miss. Gillespie."
3,"I have to jiggle it to get a signal, otherwise great","HDMI is all or none. I get a black screen sometimes, so I briefly jiggle the cable on the HD Camcorder end (mini HDMI connector) and it works fine. This is a severe enough annoyance for me to recommend you find another cheap cable for your needs. I also purchased the $1.98 full HDMI cable from amazon, and that worked perfectly, so performance has nothing to do with price."
4,Great Item For Kids & Sleepovers!,"I recently purchased 2 of the ""Aero Bed Overnighter Bed - Pink"" air mattresses for my daughter to use when she has sleepovers. The backpack is handy to store the air mattress when not in use. The battery operated pump comes with 3 attachment that can be used for inflating/deflating additional products. One word of advice is you don't need to use any of these attachments when inflating this air mattress. I used one of the attachments a few times & it actually keeps the check valve from sealing after you remove the pump. The mattress would lose quite a bit of air before I could even get the cap back on. Just use the battery operated pump by itself (no attachments) & it & works great; you don't lose any air because the check valve will seal after taking the pump off. My daughter & her little friends love these! I bought them on sale for $32.99 ea."
1,Not good,"Believe me, they can do better than this. The reception is not good. My friends always complain they can't hear me. I had to take off this headset and then everything is normal.Waste of money, though it is not expensive."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought it 2 months ago. The first week it worked pretty good. But after it went off automatically even I just took it from the charger. Plus it has a very bad design for the control button. The button is hard to control for on/off. Sometimes it's really painful to turn it on since if you push it for a little bit long, it's in discovering mode. And it can be easily turned on when it is in the pocket and redial the last phone number. Trust me, my friends are being called by it for couple times which makes me keep it out of pocket."
2,Looks aren't everything,"All i really have to say is that, it looks prettier than it works. it just goes to show me that i should of just spent a little more money for better quality."
3,Anacrónico,"Básicamente el auricular es bueno, el problema es que corresponde a una generación de celulares descontinuada. El cargador vigente es el mini USB y este auricular emplea la entrada anterior de Motorola por lo que nos obliga a traer 2 cargadores portátiles y dos para el carro. Por otro lado, es bastante más grande que los de modelo reciente y algo estorboso."
1,bluetooth earpiece,I hate this product.... It only lasts after one conversation.This is what I get for buying a used product- sometimes buying new is the best.
2,Poor sound,"This product's microphone doesn't pick up my voice very well, and injects a lot of hiss. The few times I've used it, I've had to switch to the handset in order for people to understand me. I'd use it if I had to make a call in the car -- where I can talk loudly and I need my hands free -- but not otherwise. This is really disappointing, since my wife has a different model Motorola headset and it's clear as a bell."
2,"Good input, Bad output","I could hear well on this bluetooth, but people could not hear me very well (voice sounded far away, static in the background). Finally, I had to give up and return the product."
5,its a very expensive unit for a fair price,it is a great product for the money Very pleased with the unit and the people who i bought it from
2,Could not even get it on,"This device hurt my ear. I was trying to replace my old set with this one, but have to return it.It is not flexible enough, so it takes a few minutes to put it on and requires both hands. Once it was on my ear started hurting. Bad, outdated product. Pay more buy somthing better"
1,Poor Product Not Worthy of Your Money,"Unreliable product, unfortunately.The on-off switch to the Bluetooth is wildly inconsistent, sometimes it will work and other times it won't. Sometimes it won't turn off no matter how many times you press the ""off"" switch. I put this piece of junk away and will buy a better, more reliable piece."
4,JR's Wireless Bluetooth,The Motorola HS815 is a very simple earpiece to use. It is comfortable. I keep an extra one so I can talk to family on long driving trips. I also have purchased one for my husband. I like the capability of being able to use it on either ear. I will purchase another one in the future.
4,Pretty good,"So far this headset has worked pretty good. It took a couple of times for it to fit better on my ear. It feels loose, but it doesn't fall off. Good clarity- people can hear me and I can hear them good. Just wish ear piece could be adjustable for people with smaller ears!"
5,Easy to use and excellent performance,"Reception and transmission are excellent. It is very easy to use and is quite comfortable. At the price purchased, the HS815 gets a big thumbs up."
2,Fatal problems,"The good: easy setup, lightweight, sound quality.The horrible: the ear lock flips vertically (dog ear friendly), keeps on calling people by itself which is very embarrassing.Bottom line: get the hs820 instead."
4,Blue ears,I allready purchesed 2 pair of hs815i believe it is a very good product for a number of reasonsi like the loop behind the ear. very easy to change left or right earhas a very loud speaker (i drive a truck you know)i find the sound quality very clear and crispy.and for the price you cant go wrong.i had some other Motorolas before but i find the HS815 the best for the money and the loudness.very good productG RISKA ONT CANADA
4,Nuts for Seeds,"I fell in love with sunflowers during 2011. I happened upon them during a business trip when a co-worker was going nuts eating her sunflower seeds. I tried a few and haven't stopped. I have tried a variety of flavors and this product does not disappoint. In fact, my co-worker and I buy the seeds and trade the flavors we prefer over others."
3,"Good Seeds, Flavor Ok","The sunflower seeds are big and taste good. The flavorings were not as strong and recognizable as I thought they would be. The Spicy Garlic were my favorite. I could not really get a good feel for the flavor on the BBQ seeds or the Ranch. I haven't tried the Dill Pickle or Salt & Pepper yet. Overall a good sunflower seed, but I think the flavor coatings on David & Sons is much better."
4,Very good.,"Well written, it1s a very good start point on how to support peoplo to ha a growing faith. It provides concepst and example for a honest coach."
2,disappointed,this calendar is a waste of money for any serious red sox fan. Casey Fossum for January? He's now a Diamondback. Todd Walker for November? He is now a Cub. Lastly B. Kim for December. Where's Mueller? What a joke.
3,good!,"good product. not as acurate as other devices but the price is good and if properly calibrated, it gets the job done. this is my second unit since the first lasted about 2300 km. good value."
5,great training tool!,I highly recommend this product! It is a great training tool and helps to keep you motivated to continue running.
4,Great Motivation,This is a great product for motivating someone to run. I would suggest getting the shoe pouch to go along with it as well as a case to hold the nano and the receiver at the same time. I would not suggest getting the case with no window as it does not allow you to see the screen of the nano. Nike makes another one with a clear view of the screen for a little more.
5,Very useful product,"I am a high school athlete who is new to running long distance, so this iPod Sport Kit is perfect for me. I had no idea how to judge my pace and distance, so when we bought my running shoes and saw the pamplet about the iPod Sport kit, we knew it was for me. It is amazing technology and has made my training much easier."
3,Ying and Yang,"I think the product is neat but had trouble with the signal being picked up. You never really know if the battery is on or off. Should be an indicator. When it works, it is fun, especially being told your statistics and the ""power"" song at the end."
4,Good incentive to keep running,"My wife got me an iPod Nano as an incentive when I started running, and I treated myself to the Nike Sport kit soon after.The device works as advertised (I strap the sensor to my laces rather than using a dedicated Nike shoe) and it's encouraging to see the progress on the Nike web site. And it makes you feel quilty when you notice that you've skipped a week without running :-)The one negative issue is that my iPod would occasionally reboot after attaching the dongle and going to the Nike menu in it. But I haven't have that happen in a while, so I think that the problem might have been fixed with newer iPod firmware."
5,Purdue Girl,Love the Nike + iPod Sport Kit. It is great for tracking your workouts. Also allows you to participate in marathons across the country without going to the marathon site. All you do is run your miles and sync your iPod to the computer and you are recognized as a runner. How cool. Plus you can challenge your friends near you or across the world. What a great product!
4,"Great system, but requires an investment","The Nike+iPod system works great and without a hitch, but to join the club, you need a $150 iPod nano, this kit, and unless you have just the right shoes, either some new Nike's or a third party accessory to tie the sensor up to your shoe. This kit is very durable; once, the sensor shot out of my shoe and landed in the snow. I didn't realize it for like 5 minutes. When I came back, I just popped it back in and kept running. The thing's really well built. While the kit works, I would've liked the Nike software on my computer instead of on the internet, and I would've liked better battery performance from my nano while I'm running with the kit. The receiver eats batteries for breakfast."
5,Wonderful,I love this pedometer! I was looking for something that I could put on the computer and graph my different runs and this does a wonderful job. It's easy to use and easy to set up. I don't have the Nike shoes that go with it but that's not a problem at all and it still works great.
2,Distances off and can't calibrate,"The Nike sensor has been totally off in calculating my mileage run and after numerous attempts to calibrate it to my running pace, I've had no success in making it more accurate. After attempting to find a fix for this problem, I've discovered it's pretty common on the Apple message boards. I would not buy this product again and am now thinking about investing in another pedometer."
3,nike ipod sports kit,"Loved it the first time I used it, but unfortunately it stopped working the second time. It stopped downloading my information to the nike website.I tried to utilize all the troubleshooting information on the website, but none of it got it to download my updated information."
4,Nice but a few issues,"I have been using the sport kit for a few months and I really like it. It is easy to use, uploading to the site is a breeze and it is making a difference in my workouts. I did have difficulty with callibration and I still think it is slightly off but it's not as bad as my pedometers and other tools I have used. I am rather suprised about the battery situation on the sensor and that i cannot recharge it. It appears that I have to buy a new sports kit shortly!"
3,lasted only 4 months,"I had to buy this item twice, actually I didn't know at the begining if the problem was with my ipod or with the sensor receiver, but the thing is that I bought it in octuber and by january it wouldn't work, it started failing to receive the signals from the transmiter and later on it wouldn't recognize the sensor, etc. I think that if you sweat a lot, it might catch some rust at the tiny terminals, so I would recommend to clean it if it's to wet and don't throw away the plastic cap that comes with it. Once it is working, it is great to use it with the nike plus website.The calibration can be misleading, try doing it at a race track or some flat road, try using a uniform number of steps per minute, that you can previously calculate from your normal pace when you run.Advanced runners can do it easily."
2,"Major Software Glitches, loses runs!!!","I have lost numerous runs, just today...after coming back from my 18 mile run...it was not there??? While Nike+ remains a good idea, it does have numerous software glitches that will prevent me from purchasing any more sensors. I have tried using my wife's Nano, just to check if it's the iPod, but it did the same thing, no run existed at all??? The trend I see is it only records runs under 10 miles. another problem is sometimes the voice doesn't talk to you during the run, even when you press the center button. Again, lots of software glitches that need fixing, and current owners need to be reimbursed somehow."
3,Great until the battery dies!,"I loved this product for the first month or so. I run alot but am not that bothered about exact (to the second) timing/pace/distance etc) as long as I am with 1/2 a mile which this seemed to be very consistantly.I enjoyed the tracking features on Nike web site, it gave me new motivation to see all the nice graphs etc.BUT THEN one day a flashing icon on my ipod said the sensors battery was low. You can not replace the battery in the Sensor so I wrote to Nike since I only had about 50 hours of use on it. They said not our problem call Apple!. Took a long time to find out how to get a hold of Apple and in doing so found several formums with people experiencing the same prob. Finally got a hold of Apple, they said wither dens it in and we'll try to fix it and you should get it back with in about 2 weeks or go to an apple store (closest is about 1 1/2 hrs away!). Not what I had hoped as a resolution, but I intend to get it replaced and see if the next one works for longer."
5,apple mileage recorder - ipod sport kit,"What a great product. I can record my mileage or check my calories burned, while listening to music and running. The only flaw is the ear plugs keep falling out. What is your suggestion on that?"
1,Deal Breaker,"I would love to have one of these things. But having to buy a new iPod and not being able to use my Gen 5 Video is a deal breaker. I already bought a new shuffle, just for kicks, but I refuse to buy one of each type just to be able to use this interesting Nike device. Sorry, but it's a deal breaker. Do a software upgrade to allow people to use this with their existing, perfectly good hardware."
1,I never got it,"I never receive this item, I mailed them but I did not get any answer.The worst part is that my credit card was charged."
4,Gets me out there,"There are more sophisticated gadgets to motivate you to run, but this is one of the least expensive if you already own a Nano. The available runner mixes from iTunes could use a wider range of selection, but if I wasn't so lazy, I could make my own mix. The reason this does not get five stars is that I am now on my third sport kit as the first two mysteriously malfunctioned."
3,"Okay, but too bad Nike shoes don't fit the human foot","I tried to use this kit but found that no Nike shoes would fit me! They're all WAY too narrow. The only way I could get a pair to fit was to get a full size larger, and that's really not good for running and they still didn't feel right. Nike, where's the wide shoes? Companies like New Balance have wides for almost every shoe (3 different widths even). There are some Nike shoes you can get in wides, but the selection is terrible and then try to find one in-stock (probably because everyone wants the wider shoes).Anyway, it's all a good plan, but Nike shoes really drop the ball when it comes to their non-human narrow shoe widths. They probably fit size 17 feet well, but not your typical size 10 like mine."
5,Makes exercise fun and easy,"I have been in training for the Breast Cancer 3-day walk and this little tool made it so much easier to keep track of my training distances. It also helped to keep my pace up...with the right music, of course."
5,Great product and easy to use!!,"I was a little nervous about being able to use the product and how well it would work since i didn't have the nike+ shoes, but so far, it seems to be very accurate and very easy to use."
2,Good if you have Nike Shoes,"If you have Nike shoes to use this with then it is a good buy for the price. If you buy a holder for them to attach to the shoe, it simply is so off you won't believe it. It said I was running 3 minute miles at one point and 24 minute miles at the same speed at two different points on a recent run."
1,Very Low Battery Life,"I couldn't wait to get my Nike+ Sport Kit and really loved using it, very motivational, until after 7.8 miles the battery died. Complete waste of $30+. I will not spend $19 for a new battery and throw good money after bad. I've read many reviews of low battery life and don't want to waste money on another battery that will also die. This could easily have been a rechargeable item. Poor, poor product Apple."
4,Don't miss this if you are a runner,"This product is my best running partner. Say goodbye to penciling your run data into a log book, say goodbye to your Timex watch, say goodbye to Excel sheets and whatever else you're using to track your training runs. This product is perfect. I can't run without it - even if I'm just going for a fun run."
2,Battery Life Stinks,This is my 3rd sport kit in 9 months. The battery life of the sensor does not last as long as advertised. It would be nice if there was an aftermarket brand that could be used with the ipod vs the Nike one that does not last too long. The only reason why I keep buying this sport kit is because it's the only one that works with the ipod.
5,This is the only thing that makes me exercise!,"I bought the sport kit because I love gadgets and I figured it would force me to exercise. I have NEVER run in my life, and as of today, I have run 17.75 miles since I started using this thing two weeks ago.Nikeplus.com allows you to track your progress by run, by week, or by month and set goals for yourself, which is all extremely helpful to staying on track. You don't even need Nike+ shoes - just get an adapter that goes on your shoe laces, it works just as well.I didn't think anything would get me to go running. Simply love this product!"
5,Motivation in microchip form,THe Nike+ system is a must have for any level runner. It has motivated me and helped me run further and faster than I would have not using the system. It's super-fun and informative to look at each run drawn out on the website. There are training programs on the nike plus site and you can challenge friends and other nike+ users in distance challenges and well as speed challenges. This is exactly what I needed to take my running to the next level without joining a running club. I prefer to run alone and this has helped me to do so AND push myself that bit further running with other people tends to do. Great product!
3,Sad...,"...that I bought another one of these.I like the device, though it is well worth finding a track and calibrating. But be aware that there is not a user-replaceable battery in the sensor. You can replace the sensor alone, but I rebought the whole kit for not much more money (my receiver was pretty beat up. It would be nice just to have to replace a $3 battery."
3,There's a catch.,"The catch is you have to buy a specific Nike shoe for it to work (well), or buy a separate attachment to use with your own shoes, which a lot of stores don't sell. I'd probably have skipped buying it had I realized that ahead of time."
3,read the fine print,"Excellent ergonomics as usual; however, I didn't realize you have to spent a bizzillion dollars for the iPod Nike shoe. Hence, my expectation of ""value"" was subpar."
5,A Valuable addition to the serious book collector's library.,This comprehensive volume is a must-have for collectors and admirers of the Everyman's Library. Seymour details all facets of the EL from its conception to cover design to each title's collectiblity.
1,A History Of Everyman's Library,This book disapointed me. It is in many ways more a history of Everyman's Library as a publishing venture than of the various titles in this fine series.
4,The life of a remarkable man,"Jabin Vinsen Rogers (1887-1981) began writing his life story in 1951 as a series of Christmas presents to his family. Each year from 1951 to 1979, he wrote about his experiences of the Cherokee Strip Land Rush, early days in the apple industry of Eastern Washington, of serving as Mayor of Wenatchee, WA and later in the state legislature are interspersed with comments on current events, family developments, personal opinions and poetry.A final chapter by Grandson-in-law Andrew Kille and updates from family members complete his story and an appendix traces five generations of the Jabin Messenger family and six generations of the John Robert Cowger family. Fully indexed."
4,Not All its Made Out to Be,"As a lover of military history, and WWII in particular, I was eager to read another great sea story, so highly rated. The title, Ship of Ghosts, was most intriguing, suggesting the story of a warship that kept up a fight while out of all communications. Unfortunately, the title turned out to be misleading. The USS Houston was sunk rather quickly, in its second battle of the war, so the bulk of the book describes how the American POWs survived a brutal Japanese imprisonment. An interesting read in itself, but not what it represents to be. I note that out of 420 pages, only 80 are about the sea battles. Hornfischer is a fabulous writer (maybe too good - once in a while the prose seems to get in the way of the storyline)and the story moves along, so ""Ship of Ghosts"" is worth reading, but readers should expect a story of survival, less so of battle and tactics."
3,purchased a used book thats what i got,"ok i knew this was a used book but I believe it was in ""very good"" condition as stated by seller. Ive bought other used books on line and you wouldnt have known they were ""used"". I bought the book for my stepfather hoping to pass off as new that wasnt the case, a page was dog eared and detected a slight smudges or something on a couple pages. However the book was still appreciated., and of course the story is a great story so all in all the present was a success. The book arrived way before expected"
5,historic book,very realistic book about what really happened. my uncle was on this ship and was captured by the japanese and spent the rest of the war in prison camps. he had told me quite a lot about what happened and the book backed up what he said.
3,Great book but...,"This is a great book but it is flawed in a few aspects that ""ruin"" the natural ebb and flow of the writing. the author focuses on too many individuals leaving one lost in between different events, stories and experiences. had the author focused on a handful of individuals or even just one like Laura Hillenbrand did with Unbroken it would be a phenomenal novel.The actual story in writing is quite excellent and very moving. But, it seems as if the author is trying to show off his vocabulary and ability to form complex sentences. That's not to say I'm and him competent reader but I feel the book would benefit from being toned down a bit.It is for those reasons that I knock the two stars off as I do not find myself ""glued"" to the pages as I did with Laura Hillenbrand's book. Otherwise it is an excellent story and should be read when you have the time!"
1,Why does Kindle cost more than the paperback?,"Why is the Kindle version $12.99 while the paperback version is only $9.99? The Kindle version costs nothing to make and distribute and I can't share it with anyone when I'm done. It ought to cost HALF the price of a paperback.I personally refuse to buy anything in Kindle format that costs more than hardcopy, and I urge everyone else to do the same."
4,Really awesome!,The customer service is really good and the shoes are very good for their price. The only thing I had trouble with was sizing. Be sure to get that right. I got a size 44 and it was the wrong size so I returned that and got a size 41 because my shoe size is just over 9 1/2.Pros:Great priceGood quality shoeGreat customer serviceCons:Sizing
1,Questionable performance,"Purchased this product two months ago. When I encode digital video captured from my Sony video camera I get inconsistent results. Sometimes the encoding works and sometimes after 2 hours it just quits. I wrote to the company and they sort of indicated that I might need additional software (Their response is as nebulous and incomplete as the user manual supplied). Playing with the settings I observed that the encoding always took place if I checked a box titled ""top field first"". Now I get consistency but the video is jerky, quite noticeable when the camera pans. Quite disappointed."
5,The definitive guide to opals!,"This is an Amazing Book! If you like opals, gemstones, or jewelry, you will love all the information provided in this extremely thorough, and well written book. The book takes you through the way opals are really formed. (Satisfying the scientist in us all). Then it takes you into the history of all the amazing opal finds around the world and where to find your own opals. (satisfying anyone who wants to know how the opal trade works). It also wonderfully describes the worlds most magnificent opals ever found. Including one of the largest solid opals ever found, The Bonanza found by Keith Hodson. (capturing the jewelry lovers).If you want to know anything about opals, you've got to get this book!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Piece of junk. Cannot push the pins out of #25 chain even though it says it is designed for just that use. The chain slips no matter if you use a vise, lock jaw, whatever. Don't buy this item. It does not work!!"
5,Great GPS if it's what you are looking for,"This GPS comes with 5 bare wires that you have to hook up to power and a serial port plug yourself. It has a PPS (Pulse Per Second) output on one of the wires for time synchronization applications (the serial interface and USB versions are missing that).If this is what you need then it's a great GPS at a good price. If you want something to easily hook up to your computer you should look for the USB or the Serial interface versions.The cable on the GPS is about 3 meter long (9 feet).Garmin also makes a version with a 5 meter (15 feet) cable.Amazon used to sell this version but calling it (confusingly) ""Garmin GPS 18 GPS Sensor with PC Cable"" making it sound like it comes with a ""PC compatible cable"" (whatever that is). I imagine they got a lot of returns because people didn't get what they expected."
4,Very cute,Very cute product and good quality. Love the way it looks and keeps our dog leashes readily accessible and untangled.
1,One of the worst book on Use Cases,One of the worst book I read so far on Use Cases. I read first and second chapters and found that author just confuses more then clarifying. Already returned it. Wondering how come this book received good star rating (the only reason I bought this book) when it is just a time waste.
4,Best pure writing use case book,"There are a number of Use Case resources out there. Many focus on diagrammatic elements/style of use cases. These I could care less for (Applying Use Cases from Addison-Wesley/3-amigos series is one flop). My users want to review solidly written, concise scenarios IN TEXT. Alistair present a cohesive approach for developing and writing clear use cases.4 instead of five stars is due to the following: -I reserve 5 stars for classics, and I have yet to be certain this book is one -I did not care for his subtle but odd notation symbols that are proposed as a way of identifying the broad place the use case has in the overall systemStill, these were minor complaints. In this book I have a great guide to jump-starting my use case writing process."
5,made ME look like 5 stars at work,"I used the material in this book to define requirements for quality of delivered use cases, and then develop the use cases for a fully functional ecommerce and marketing site. I looked like a star when the job was done- it was one of the few efforts on this project that was recognized by everyone as being competent..."
5,Good Investment,Alistair Cockburn has a gift for writing. His explanations are very easy to follow and the writing style makes it seem like you are reading novel. I tried a number of books on use cases and this is by far the best. It contains a number of different styles. I used this book as a basis for developing standards for the company I work for.I haven't seen any other book on Use Cases that is as comprehensive. Even the authors of UML don't do Use Cases any justice!
5,Excellent,"An excellent User Guide on how to write use cases. Do's and Dont's, advice, hints, ... We passed it around our project and people got on board right away. Explanations are clear and rely on real project experiences."
5,Yummy!,"Yummy! Tried this at a farmers market and loved it. Have made several unique dishes by simply adding the packet of spices to ""wow"" friends with at dinner parties."
4,Fun Fantasy Reading,"My 9 year old son and I really enjoyed reading this one. He loves baseball and enjoyed this historical fiction story. We recommend it to other boys of a similar age who love baseball. For older boys though, the story might be alittle far-fetched."
3,Shoeless Joe & Me,It would be a very good book for a young person who would be interested in old time baseball. It had some historic value but was a bit light and predicible for an adult.
4,THE BEST BOOK!!!,This is a really good book. I rated it 4 stars because I am really picky. My friends made me read it but then after that I couldn't put it down! This 'boring' book turn out to be awsome!
5,A Kid's review--Shoeless Joe and me is one of the best books ever !!!,"At first I didn't think I would like the book.But then as I read it I LOVED it!It's about a kid named Joe Stoshack who travels back to 1919 to try to stop the Black Sox Scandle from taking place and get Shoeless Joe into the Hall Of Fame. But on the way he meets gamblers and suprises.But he did not go back in time just to do that. He is also on a mission to take a picture of his great grandmother,Gladys and his uncle, Wilber.When he goes back to the future,there is a big surprise.If I were able to give this book a rating 1 out of 100 I would give it a 100.THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!!!"
4,Shoeless Joe and ME,It had a great beginning and middle but I thought the end wasn't to good. I thought it was an overall good story.
5,great,you'll love this book if you love baseball and wdatch it because it tells you about history and it is exciting.
4,Just wanted to say:,"Whether or not this 1990 volume truly is (as its cover's subtitle purports) ""Everything You Need to Know to Play and Win,"" it's definitely Mizerak's most fun-to-browse book. This oversized paperback's 200 pages are replete with (black-and-white) photos and other kinds of illustrations, many of which are charmingly old-fashioned (quaint). Especially considering its affordability, no pool-book collector's shelf should be without this."
3,"Good all-around book on pool, but no depth","This book covers a good all-around view of pool. but it fails to go in depth, especially on strategy. It's a good book at first, but after awhile you crave more knowledge of the game, especially specific games. I recommend authors like Byrne (not only does he write on pool, he also covers 3-Cushion inside and out, great job), Fels (Mastering Pool is a great strategy guide if you can hunt it down on the net. not complete yet still very helpful), and Capelle (great book on one great game...Straight Pool)."
5,Touching!,"It is a beautiful story. It addresses issues of racism, interracial marriage, a high school girl's crush..on another girl, a beautiful friendshp all without ever sounding preachy. The writing is crisp, descriptive and succinct."
2,"I wanted to like it, but....","Staggerlee lives in a small, African-American community in the South. She struggles with her biracial identity (her mother is white) and also wonders if she might be gay, even though she has no words to talk about it. She is lonely and feels like she just doesn't fit anywhere.When her cousin, Trout, visits during the summer when both girls are 14, they become very close, united in their struggles to define their identities.Woodson touches on some poignant issues and I had high hopes for this story, but it never really grabbed me."
4,Didn't Think they would pull it off,"I was a bit sceptical when i read Westlife would be doing a Frank Sinatra covers album, but I must admit the delivery really does justice to the material. Well done kids, there is life after the boysband tag after all :)"
2,If It Ain't Broken......,"I guess I'm genuinely stumped by this one. True, the orchestration's nice, and the voices are OK, but what's the purpose of it all? Listening to these songs only makes me want to hear the real tunes, sung by the artists who made them great. It's akin to refilming ""Gone with the Wind"" for 21st- century audiences: Since these songs were perfectly performed the first time, why bother remaking them? If it ain't broke -- which the original performances clearly aren't -- why fix (i.e.: re-record) them?"
2,"Weak, Lifeless, and Unnecessary","Ok, everyone pales next to the Great Sinatra. But there was no need for these tepid, uninspired takes on songs that are associated with Frank (I Left My Heart in San Francisco? Huh?). The lads just don't have the feel for the songs. It comes across as exactly what it is - young singers who are being raised in the homogenized lifeless age of American Idol, who just don't understand the emotional underpinnings of the Great American Songbook, just singing notes and words. Totally bland."
4,HERE WE GO AGAIN1,"Westlife wallows in the Rat Pack-vein and what a gig it is.Mostly the credit must go to the enormously swinging back-up orchestra.That means of course a lift for crooners ,as Frankie certainly knew,i.e.if lacking a purely tonal voice but instead possess a technical first rate timing and phrasing.We`ll never have a supporting orchestra like May,Riddle or Hefti again but this aggregation is not far behind."
4,great way to publicize vocal music...,"Lets be frankly honest.... that this album is not that bad as the previous reviewers criticized it. I am was never really into Vocal music before, and now I am regular listener of that genre. Westlife does a great job introducing standards to the young audience. That does not necessarily mean that they will enjoy it. The people who enjoy music to its max are people who have an open mind. I absolutely fell in love with this album. Though they cant be compared to the vocal greats like Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams... they do a decent job."
3,Mine was NOT an antenna topper,"I had a real antenna topper that had a soft black plastic area around the hole that kept it on my antenna. My ANTENNA WAS STOLEN WITH THE SNITCH! I ordered this as a replacement, but what I received only had a very small opening that made it useless as a topper. I am keeping it for my collection, but I am still looking for a topper."
1,Wish i could give fewer stars,"Very misleading.The title of this is ""Harry Potter Sorcerer's Stone Quidditch Golden Winged Snitch Antenna"".It literally says ANTENNA in the title. But as soon as you receive it and read the note from seller, it says something about it just being a prop and not to use on an antenna. Not to mention, upon opening it, the wings fell off.Please, i beg you, do not purchase this."
2,not quite what I expected,"I mean, I wasn't expecting anything grandiose, but it looks like something out of a Burger King kids' meal. I was a little disappointed."
2,Broke Like a Joke,I cannot believe that I have spent my money on this accessory that is worth absolutely nothing. You could touch it but don't drop it or play with the wings otherwise they might come out. It was fun to see but was not at all fun to seize. It became broke like a joke.
2,Can't use as promised,"This 'antenna"" toy can't be used on my car. The hole provided us way too small. When I tried to expand it, the ball shattered. A complete waste of money."
2,Disappointing,My friends got me this for my birthday and at first I loved it. Until about two days in. The wings became bent and misshapen while the ball itself is so heavy that driving over 30 miles an hour would make my antenna almost bend in half and loosen the antenna itself. I still keep it in my car but I definitely won't be using it for its purpose.
3,Fun while it lasted,"It lost both of its wings on the first car ride; was soooooo disappointed! But I love the idea of it, so I will be ordering another one, with some super strong glue, to permanently attach the wings. I had ordered 2 & given one as a gift, & advised them to super-glue the wings on before putting it on their car antenna. And that is my advice to anyone else who wants to put this on their antenna; super-glue the wings first. Love the idea, but the quality was rather poor. I hate to write such a negative review, but I am compelled to issue the warning and hopefully prevent some disappointment and heartache for someone else."
1,"Don't buy! Cheap, doesn't fit.","So I saw a car that has a nice snitch on its antenna, so I looked it up here to get one. The thing that arrived was NOT like the one I saw in person, or like the image they show for this product. On the package, it's labeled as a ""toy"" for ages 4+, and mentions nothing of being for an antenna. There's no way it will fit an antenna (especially the newer fat ones that are on newer cars), and even if it DID fit, they wings are just cheap little plastic things (think really thin plastic, like kind used for toy packaging), and would fly right off. Save your money."
1,Wrong Product for My Vehicle,"The Amazon Website had this converter compatible with my auto-I own a 2002 Pontiac Firebird, 3.8L V6 engine, base model trim....This converter is designed according to The Walker Website for a 3.4L V6 Firebird 1995 or older.........It goes to say this converter did not work properly."
2,Not for heavy use,"I bought this product two years ago for a horsepacking expedition along the Colorado Trail. The price attracted me at the time, but I soon found out that even travelling in the car that the non-stick finish was easily abraded. Rust soon ensued. I still own this set and it is servicable, but don't recommened it except for car camping, and even then, pack your dish towels between the pots."
3,"Great story, cheaply made","Needed a better ending to bring closure.Good story line, cheaply done which took away from the movie."
5,Another great CD from Magpie,"My wife purchased this for me some years ago. We play it often. If you like their other CDs, you will like this one too."
3,great condition,received item in great condition unfortunately it was not the cd i was looking for sound hound droped the ball a dance hall club hit i was looking for was not on this cd
5,A real speed demon!,"After some wheeling and dealing within my department, I was able to buy this little beauty. Going in knowing about the screen size and battery life, I am quite impressed with this unit. For many years I've wanted a small, light, stylish laptop. This is the ticket! Everyhing about the design and external devices exhudes quality. I'm glad I bought this one. The DVD burner is nice and the mouse is very cool. Looks like a race car! The AMD processor is very stable and a real screamer! The machine runs Vista faster than my desktop at work,with 2gb of ram. I had no trouble setting up wireless at home or work. Windows Ultimate Vista is nice, very automated. I'm a computer professional and I'd highly recommend this laptop to anyone. Very enjoyable to use!"
3,Acceptional,"Compared to a similar brand laptop (Vaio SZ permium), I don't believe this laptop is the best for me as I probably thought.Screen is too small for either gaming or seriose work. One inch bigger with sony does make a difference!The weight isn't very light, the lack of a built in cd drive is something I didn't like either.Other than that, its OK."
4,Almost an Autoart.,"So close to perfection, then they put a chrome exhaust on.The chrome exhaust ruined the 5 star rating. Everything else looks amazing.Seriously, who makes a chrome exhaust?"
2,I didn't laugh once!,"Maybe Sedaris doesn't translate into audio for me. The books make me laugh plenty, but I couldn't get through the first ten minutes of this CD. I didn't laugh once. Maybe he's just too deadpan...Also I noticed he's just reading straight from his writings. So there is no interaction with the audience. Perhaps that's what I need to hear from a live ""performance""."
1,Outdated,Although it does have some relative information it is ten years out of date. Updates on tax laws would be the place to start.
5,Pocket Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus,"Bought as a gift for my son. He said this is the most helpful book, for his class work, that I have sent him in last two years."
2,Silly Story,"Arturo's Baton is a silly little story about a conductor who loses his baton and believes he can't conduct without it. He comes to realize that it is his abilities that lead the orchestra, not the baton. In the process the author leaves young readers with the false impression that a baton serves no purpose, rather than showing them how important and useful a baton can be."
4,Butane Lantern hums,I love this little lantern. It doesn't blind you like a big 2 mantle Coleman. Its very adjustable and fires righ up without matches. The butane cartiges are very easy to find as they are the same ones used by caterers everywhere. They are dirt cheap at any resturant supply store and last and last.
4,moving up to InDesign CS3,"I've been a long term PageMaker user and owned every version from 1.0 upwards to 7.0. So it was always going to be a hard thing to make the change to anything else. I bought InDesign mainly because I was getting problems with the more demanding DTP jobs that required separations, as well as feeling that more of what I created separately in Corel really ought to have been part of my main layout program. However, within a week of starting to use InDesign, I feel quite at home. There's enough carry-through to make life seem familiar, but loads of new intuitive functionality. It's early days, so I'm sure I'll find some limitations later, but they haven't appeared yet."
5,Great tent!,"This is a great tent! The second night of using it we got thunder and torrential rain, it leaked a bit around the ground seams, but nowhere else. With a tarp underneath and another coat of sealant, we don't expect any problems next time. Tons of room inside for everthing you need to bring. Loved the shoe pocket - especially that you can get at it from inside or outside the tent. Gear loft was perfect for hanging wet clothes/towels from. We highly recommend this tent to anyone!"
2,Leaks even in a slight rain,We have used this tent twice with no rain at all and there was no problem. However this weekend it started to rain and we waked up in the water. The rain was not heavy at all but the doors (zips) were leaking and the worst part is that the top cover is not large enough to keep the rain out of the doors. We are very frustrated now. I am now planing to buy another tent.
1,Wet and collapses in wind,First time we used it a small windy rain storm came through and a pole broke and collapsed the whole tent drenching everything within. We had to pack up everything in the pouring rain with 3 kids and a dog and end our trip 2 days early. And our friend with an alot cheaper tent were fine and stayed and enjoyed the rest of there trip!!!!!!!!!! Do not recommend for anyone!!!!
3,Great tent but watch for leaks around the doors,"I bought this tent last september, have used it twice. In dry weather it's a champ, In wet weather, beware of puddles around each of the four doors but the rest stayed dry. It looks to me like the zippers were not waterproofed (or even that waterproof zippers weren't used) when the tent was produced and you can watch the water drip off the bottom lip around each zipper.In fairness, the doors always are a place where a LOT of tents have leak issues, the leaks could also be caused by the single layer of fabric beneath the door, should be thicker. All in all, a very easy tent to set up and take down and is very spacious inside the main dome, you can't stand up in the side rooms. A very spacious and comfortable tent for two people, I don't think I'd like sleeping in the side rooms, I use them for gear."
2,Wet camping with leaky tent.....,"Sometimes design and functionality don't go together, and this tent gets high marks on design, ease of pitching, and neat ideas like the gear loft, shoe bag etc.BUT IT LEAKS badly, even after seam sealing. We ended up with inches of water pooled in all corners of the tent coming in through the seams around the doors/windows, and there was a small hole in the top of the fly which we only discovered when we pitched the tent. One of the shafts of the tent poles split apart on the first use! We had wet books, sleeping bags, gear, clothes - everything in the tent for 6 people!Target refunded our money (Mayfield, OH, great service), but don't waste your time unless you will only be camping in dry weather. I expected better quality from Eddie Bauer given the premium pricing of these tents."
2,Big tent that leaks like a coffee filter,"This tent is big, But it holds out the water about as good as a coffee filter. The tent leaked at every seam and at every door and at every zipper and even through the sides. The reply to my E-mail to Eddie Bauer.com was just to return it. It was great to get the money back from the tent, But the money I lost from the family vacation being cut way short is gone because of the lousy tent. Makes you wonder about the products and customer service that Eddie Bauer provides."
2,It Leaks,"The first night I put the tent up it rained. It leaked around all windows and doors. Around the skylights and every seam. The tent does have some nice features but if it can't keep you and your gear dry, what good is it? I will be returning it as soon as it dries out."
2,Got leaks?,"This is a nice tent for warmer weather, consider other options if you use it in cold weather. The plastic skylights became very brittle and cracked after 2 uses in 40 degree weather, resulting in a very wet night. On the plus side, Wenzel the tents manufacturer was more than happy to send out a new replacement fly for free. I will use this tent for summer use and find a better cold weather tent for the cold months."
5,A Big Help,I love the movie Sling Blade and believe every child should have a Karl. Reading the screenplay was a way of having the movie with me when I was reading it.
1,Below average preparation guide,"This book is below average for several reasons:1. The math questions are very limited in scope. They only cover areas that are introduced in the book.2. The critical reasoning questions are terrible. They don't cover the question types the official GMAT guide covers.3. Numerous errors in their answers. A lot of answer reviews have remarks like ""that's the best choice"" and no real explanations following it."
1,Not CATs,The mistake is that the tests aren't computerized tests. That means they have limited value for GMAT prep since the GMATs are only available as GMAT CATs since 1998. The GMAT CAT is a computerized test that is taken on a computer instead of the old paper-and-pencil format this is based on. You can get CAT books or download GMAT CATs from the net.
4,Neat and Inexpensive,"I have spent two nights in this tent, during which it rained all night. The tent worked great, except (as some have noted), the little awning over the front door is not quite large enough. A little rain leaked in at the foot of the front door. I am considering adding a little ""porch"" from an old fly to solve this problem.I especially like the overhead net for holding gear like flashlights and my eyeglasses. And the window that is in the tent and the fly lets you look at the stars at night."
2,Not very happy,"I guess I got what I paid for, but you would think with the Eddie Bauer name, that the tent would be better then it is. It ripped on the first day, the fly does not get as tight at it shows in the picture--there are no poles to run through it. I was disappointed with this purchase. Stick with brands that know camping equipment. This was cheaply made and it shows--seams show signs of stress all over."
2,a little disappointed,"We were a little disappointed in this tent for the price. It really would not sleep 4 people well. It was just my husband and I using it, and I could maybe imagine a child packed in there but not a 4th person. Also, we found that it wasn't that easy to put together. The directions were lacking and the color-coded system was incomplete. Some of the neat features like the place to store your shoes on the edge of the tent were a nice concept, but not as great in practice because my husband's tennis shoes barely fit in there, never mind anyone else's. I do think that it is an attractive tent and that it held up to the high winds well."
2,POOR ZIPPER DESIGN,"The first time I used the tent I was very happy with it. I have used this tent a total of three times. The zipper broke. I tried to fix it but it just got worse, then the zipper pull broke."
3,Badly constructed tent,"We own a couple of other brands but we needed an additional tent for our next year's vacation. So we bought this tent and decided to try it out this year in WI. The front door is not a D or an inverted U door (as on the picture) but an O, and it zips down from the top. The fly did not cover the top of it and the little rain we had found its way into the tent. Of course the net being on the outside and the fabric on the inside of the doors and windows did not help to keep the raindrops out. It also leaked from the shoe storage area. In addition to these, the tent was sold as a 4 person tent but only two average weight, more on the thin side women could fit in it comfortably. Now we are searching for another 4-person tent that is better constructed than this one and gives the dimensions and sleeping positions of the tent."
4,Great bang for your buck,"A lot of tents this size are fairly easy to set up, but I have to say that this is one of the easiest. I set it up at 2am, in the pitch dark...and it took me less than 10 minutes. Enough said.Some other great features: the sun/moon roof is great for ventilation and a view of the stars, the mesh pockets and mesh net at the top and conveniently located, and the tent withstands heat pretty well.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied!!!"
4,Great looking tent,"The tent is large and enough room for four people. However when using a bed, only two person could feel comfortable. This was the first time I used this tent and was able to set up in less than 10 minutes though I tried once at my home. But also I could not get the tightness while setting up the tent as shown in the picture. It has great design and color combinations. It is roomier and enough place for storage. I loved the star gazing feature and enough hooks and windows inside for ventillation. I would certainly recommend this tent; although I am willing to try another with similar style and price."
2,"Didn't leak, But DOESN'T ZIP","Like the previous reviewer, I experienced problems with the door zipper -- it kept getting caught on the outside flap and it was very difficult to un-jam. On a more positive note, the tent hadn't been waterproofed and though it rained heavily all night, the tent stayed dry inside. We thought we were lucky until the zipper fiasco -- so while the tent didn't leak, struggling with the zipper DID let rain in. I wouldn't recommend this tent. It was fairly easy to set up, seemed roomy, and held up in the wind & rain, but unfortunately the zipper difficulty was an inconvenience that overshadows the positive features in my mind. I guess it's lucky we borrowed the tent from a friend ..."
1,"You get what you pay for...well, sometimes.","I used the tent 2 times and the zipper broke. I had trouble with the zipper the first time, but the second time it completely broke.I threw it in the dumpster as I left the campsite. I have upgraded to a Kelty Green River."
2,Smaller Than Expected,"Although it is advertised as a 4 person tent, it truely is meant for 2 people..."
3,Good Choice?,"I just purchased this tent for a camping trip in May. I made my choice based on the reviews I found at this website and when I got to the store to purchase it there was another model marked down to the same price as this one. I took alot of time making my choice, but ultimately decided on this tent because of the reviews I read. I see that a negative one has been added in the last week or so. I am looking forward to my trip and hope that I made a good choice. I'll write with my experiences after my return!!"
5,I loved it!,"This was the story of Maggie and Hadyn, cousins that just can't seem to get along. Hadyn has come to live with Maggie's family and one night Maggie's father gets hurt. Her Mother takes him down to the town for him to see the doctor. That leaves Maggie and Hadyn alone. They have an arguement and Hadyn decides to go to the train station-by walking. But he sees a mountain lion and runs farther and farther off the track. Maggie discovers Hadyn never made it to town and sets out to find him. Can they battle winds and snowslides? The snowslide was terrifying I just couldn't put the book down! Maggie was a great character."
5,Bone-CHILLING!,"The SURVIVAL! books are cool! Don't believe all those ""they're boring"" reports. True, some are predictable, but some books are just like that. What good authors do is write the story in such as way that even predictable plots are exciting because you want to see how it will play out.Book #3, Blizzard, is one of the best. I've read five of these books, and this ranks among the top. The vivid descriptions of Maggie's and Hadyn's fear-filled fight for survival in an uncanny, white wilderness is really bone-CHILLING!"
5,Jar Pop,"This item is as advertised. It is wonderful. I am giving several as Christmas gifts. This was my first order from Amazon but it won't be my last. In fact, I have placed & received another order since this one & am pleased with it also."
5,indispensable!!,"I got one of these gadgets as a gift and LOVE it - when you have a vacuum sealed jar (jam, spagetti sauce), just use this device like an old can opener, putting up against the edge of the jar's lid and then tipping the jarpop counterclockwise. The jarpop will break the vacuum seal (you'll hear a little ""pop"") and then you can open the jar just as if it was an already opened jar w/ no effort at all. My mom liked my jar pop so much she took it home w/ her. Now I got several and I give them to all the women friends I have as stocking stuffers,etc. They are so handy!!"
3,"Works on most jars, but poor design","This tool makes it easy to break the vacuum seal of the lid on most (but not all) types of jars so that you can unscrew the lid without using much force. My main criticism is that it's poorly designed -- it looks too much like a bottle opener. On many occasions when friends are over, someone unfamiliar with this item has picked it up and tried to open a bottle with it, which of course doesn't work. The designer / manufacturer could have easily discovered and corrected this flaw by performing basic usability testing."
3,Great Bottle Opener,"It does it's job great but I'm taking off two stars due to the fact that the leverage is kind of off, when you go to open a beer bottle, it has the tendency to pull the bottle towards you resulting in spilt beer, and spilt beer is a horrible misfortune!"
3,Doesn't work on all jars...,"I was very excited to order this product. I am so tired of not being able to open jar lids without banging on them with a knife or asking my husband (and I am only in my mid-40s!).But the first opportunity I had to use it it didn't work! It was a jar of Classico pasta sauce. Apparently if there is a lip on the jar under the lid, the JarPop can't get up under the lid and therefore ""pop"" it. I tried a dozen times but realized it just wasn't going to work on this jar, so beware.I am optimistic that it will work on other jars but have yet to try it."
4,Inspiring book that stretches your concept of reality to include success and money! Yahoo.,"I love this book. I read it through once. Did one exercise, and change is already happening. Now I keep it with me to just open a page, read one or two paragraphs to have a thought for the day to reflect upon. This is a simple process that Joe teaches. Notice I did not say easy. But the rewards of doing them are great. The only thing Joe could have done better in this book, is repeat the five steps again and again and again. But hey, you have the book and it is worth every penny. I bought both this book and Spiritual Marketing at the same time not knowing it was an earlier version of this book. But I have read them both and love them. I'm going to buy some extra copies and pass around. You can change your life. You can become a magnet to success and prosperity. Joe did it and so can I."
4,The Attractor Factor/Spiritual Marketing,"I thought this was a great, inspiring, and lighthearted read. I enjoyed the stories throughout. I think that stories are a helpful way to show people how to create what they want. It is also full of real-life examples and incidents that others can compare to their own manifestations. Furthermore, I am a marketing professional as well so I gained even more good energy to propel my creativity. This book made me feel good!"
4,I like the Ultimate Secret,"Mr. Joe Vitale has written this book in a very pesonal way. Personal vignettes sprinkled all over the book have shown his ""Attractor Factor"".Mr. Vitale was transparent in narrating the ""Jonathan's"" tale. The latter's unfortunate tale has somewhat created a surprise, just like in a typical movie.Because it's personal and transparent, the book exudes with credibility.However, four of the five success strategies that Mr. Vitale espouses were not new.What I consider unique and different from the rest is the ""ultimate secret."" This secret can be summarized by the statement ""Thy will be done.""This ultimate secret has added a spiritual component to a conventional book."
4,"great info, I find it useful","I like this a lot. The stories are sometimes just about how easy it has been for the author to get money, but the principles are good and worth trying out. I am more open minded, out of the box and thinking bigger. I feel more hope and now have the energy to do things that Ikve been wanting to do. I'm feeling good about taking risks to get what I want from life and I want to give back. So listen to the info and then do the exercises, and practice the principles. You'll see changes in your life if you do."
1,BORING MONOTONE NARRATION,I couldn't even get through 1 CD his voice was sooooooo boring.... Very disappointed. I call this one FALSE ADVERTISING. It wasn't worth one dime of what I paid for it.
4,not so bad,"I enjoyed this book. However, in order to take what the author says seriously, you have to really do some hard thinking about things in your life and things you want to change."
3,Thee Attractor Factor,"The book is extremely easy reading. His presentation is easy to understand. I felt he had a lot irrelevant filler information in the book, however."
4,"The Key to ""The Secret"" for Small Businesses","With all the buzz about the movie The Secret flying around, this book should be flying off the shelves. As a long-time student of success and motivation books of all types, I thought this one would be ""old news"" for me - but as they say, ""when the student is ready, the teacher appears."" I found Joe's writing style to be extremely easy to read, and his grasp of what it takes to manifest success in every area of your life is solid. I learned several principles I had not heard before in relation to getting what I want out of life. I may have heard them before, but it's good to have a refresher so I can remember them and actually practice them in my life!I highly recommend The Attractor Factor as ""The Key to 'The Secret"" for small business owners who are frustrated that they aren't getting the results they expected or hoped to see in their business. Read with an open mind and an open heart, this book can change your business - and your life!"
4,The Attractor Factor:5 Easy Steps to Creating Wealth,"This book was an easy read and fast moving. Most of the points could be traced back to Biblical scripture, but the book is written from a more ecumenical vantage point. I would guess that the author is associated with the New Age Movement in some manner or other. The keys to follow in the Attractor Factor remind us to be good and decent people and focus on the positive."
5,Natural Laws,"I bought this book along with The Law of Attraction by Michael Losier. They fit together as a hand in a glove. For me, both rate 5 stars. Writing, clear, easy to understand. Apt examples from real life well illutrate the subject matter. If one is earnest in reaching their desires, these books are both a ""must have"".... provided one puts in the required due effort!"
2,the Attractor Factor,it was ok thought I'd get more out of it. Heard alot about this but didn't get what I expected out of it.
3,"just an expanded version of ""spiritual marketing""","this book is just an expansion of ""spiritutal marketing"", nothing new. if you have read books by napoleon hill or clement stones, this is just a clone of them. it is just a make you ""feel good"" book."
1,Fluff / Larry King interview,"This book has about 90% fluff and 10% information.Joe Vitale has a way of writing, and writing, and writing, saying the same thing in ten different ways to build up his word count and pages.Since ordering his book, I've seen some of the ads he's written and they have the same amount of fluff.Also, I saw his interview on Larry King Live about his part in ""The Secret"". Joe believes EVERYTHING that happens to us, we attract. When Larry asked him about the little girl in Florida who was raped and buried alive in garbage bags, if she attracted that to herself. His answer was YES.Although I believe we are responsible for a lot that happens, there is no way I could possible believe that would be the case with this little girl or any other innocent victim of crime.I would never buy another product from Joe Vitale again.WCS"
4,Attactor Factor,This Book in incredible for keeping you on track and focused on positive thinking on all levels.
3,REDUNDANT,"I bought this book after reading raving reviews. Of course, the main attraction factor is money for the author. What is said could be said in two paragraphs. Am glad for the author that he has become rich with so many books, etc. But the point in the book is: ""You attract what you think."" If you think positive and that good things will happen, they will materialize. Just have faith. If you think negative, negative things will happen and you will be stuck. Also think you are important, and you will be important, etc. Great points all these, so some stars."
5,I used this book to create both my jobs this year!,"I loved this book. I'm using the principles to create new possibilities in my life right now! At the beginning of the year in March,2005 I used the steps to create a cool training contract with Hewlett Packard through Modus IT. My contract took me traveling across America to all the Ford Motor Plants and Ford Motor Credit sites from Colorado Springs, Colorado to Cleveland, Ohio to Maryland and back to Michigan. I followed the steps and applied them! After I finished my contract with HP/Modus IT, I was able to create a better job as a Talent Scout! I even manifested a real screenplay writer/partner! True Story. Hopefully, I can use the principles to create more adventures, more passion, more opportunities, more networking events,and more friends."
4,Good stuff!,"Mr. Vitale is a legitimate seller of goods - that being how to manifest what you want and marketing (primarily on the internet). Based upon that I give him 4 stars and hold off 5 stars because I haven't applied his principles yet; just read the book. Contrast this with my review of T. Harv Ecker's book (really his ""seminars"" and ""training camps"") and you will understand I don't pee on everyone's parade, only those who I think are useless or deceptive."
5,Excellent book!,"The author covers each point he makes in detail and directs the reader to actually perform the exercise. He leaves you with no questions, and that's why people that consider buying this book should do so. Their questions are answered, and that is what we all seek when purchasing a book like this one!"
5,Great book!,"I have read this book a few times over the last couple years. I keep giving them away and have to keep purchasing another one. I would highly recommend. Yes, Joe does advertise a lot but he has some good messages that really have improved my life and I have him to thank for that. I am not into email marketing etc...but it does not matter. I got what I needed out of the book and it works for me. I read this book before the Secret came out. I definitely recommend. I also recommend the Key and the Life Lessons book and also listening to his podcasts on his website. I am now making it my goal to feel joy and be happy NOW. His books are helping me to do this."
3,"I must be honest, it was a bit disappointing","After so many glowing reviews I had huge expectations for this book. I was disappointed. I've read many self help books and this one wasn't one of the better ones. Not really original in any way, it's a collection of references to other books. One of the funny things about it was the first 20 pages were testimonials, not exactly what I would call rich in content. The basic idea is sound but I'm not sure this book is worth reading if you've read several other self help books."
2,5 not so easy steps,"I was expecting, like the title implies, that the 5 steps would be 'easy'. The title is a little misleading even for the author, who himself, despite all his 'wisdom' seems to constantly be faced with 'emotional blocks' preventing him from manifesting his desires... that is until he clears them. How? He heads off to healers... has 'spirits' work on him... and hires Hindu priests to perform 'yagyas' for him, etc. Hardly simple or feasible for many of us!If that doesn't turn you off enough, there are the constant 'plugs' he gives all his famous friends throughout the book.There are a number of stories in the book, many of which could have been left out as they provided no useable information. And since when did 'Thy Will Be Done' mean 'gimme this or better'???I did manage, however, to find a couple of useful tidbits of information I had not run across before, which explains my 2-star rating."
4,Worth reading,"Joe got it across to me in one sentence: ""I believe our planet is what was described in an original Star Trek episode called ""Shore Leave.""...""they [Kirk, Spock et al] are on a planet that reads their thoughts and creates what they think about."" Now, if you're not familiar with the concept that your internal world creates your external world, that's an 'out there' idea... Yes, parts of the book are redundant... and I'm not into all the spiritual stuff... but that's okay, because the concepts are simple and simply explained. Not to mention uplifting and inspiring. I love it. I've read it twice in a year now, and enjoyed it both times. Thanks Joe!"
4,Believe in yourself and others will too!,"I have to say that Dr. Vitale is an excellent motivator, and having read this book, and listened to his podcast which is a good way to supplement your motivations whenever you are challenged to stay the path to true happiness! I am a NOTORIOUSLY negative personality, and I do occasionally use my ""hard childhood"" to tell me that I don't deserve success, but with the help of this book, his podcast, and his new book (coming out soon) I am putting that attitude behind me so that I can create my own success.I am NOT one of these spiritual types that wants a guru to tell me the secrets of the universe, and Joe isn't that guru. He simply tells you that if you believe in yourself, market yourself, and excite others about what you have to say, you WILL be successful. Plain and simple."
1,"Worst Book ever, shady author","I remember when I got this book because of reviews a few years back, then I found out why it had good reviews. Any bad reviews written about it were deleted, I combated this by rewriting my review everyday for weeks and everyday it would be deleted. How could this happen? Don't know but you can tell from the book the author is shady. The book is horrible, I urge everyone not to even consider this book, don't give him your money"
5,Upbeat and informing,I guess I like my enlightenment on the light side - what that says about me I don't know. But this is a book I read cover to cover and the more detailed metaphysical books are still sitting by my bedside. I have read several of Joe's books and thoroughly enjoy each and every one of them! They share a simple message that is easy to incorporate into your lifestyle...so you can get on with your wonderful life!
5,An Awesome Book,Highly reccommended.This book is easy to understand and once you start it you won't want to put it down.
3,5 Easy Steps Are Sound,"You might think Joe Vitale's The Attractor Factor is about dating and relationships but it is not; at least not directly, instead it is about how the way you think impacts the results you get in life. Vitale has distilled his process into knowing what you want and don't want, dealing with negative thoughts, feeling your intention already achieved and wanting without needing.For instance in step five Vitale states,""When you want something but, can live without having it, you have upped the odds of having it...But as soon as you say,""I must have this,"" you begin to push it away."" This goes back to the way we think about things and how thinking affects feeling and behaving and thus what we get or do not get in life.At times The Attractor Factor can get a little too New Agey with ideas like ""Karmic Surgery"" and ""yagyas"" and ""yagnas"" but the basic psychology is behind it is sound applying the five basic principals can help people get more of what they want out of life."
5,Absolutely motivating and intelligent,"I have read nearly 200 metaphysical/motivational books over thepast 15 years and this one just made my top 5! His style of writing is so enthusiastic, intelligent and motivating, I couldhardly put it down. No matter what stage of life you are inor what your current challenge, I believe this book will helpmotivate you in ways that will help you move upward and onward.I also am now on his email list. Everyone wants to associatewith really successful people and I want to stay connected withwhat Joe Vitale has to say because he will NEVER stop moving forward and he will also continue to share his knowledge and wisdom with us."
3,Good resource,"As motivational success books go, this one is okay. If you like reading other people's stories, it offers some good ones to support the ideas. The success steps (5) are easily explained and are easy to follow. Like any other success book, it only will help you if you actually follow the steps. If you DO steps, there is no doubt you will see results."
2,Its alright,"The Attractor Factor does have good information. But honestly I actually didn't get past the 3rd disc because I got tired of listening to him mostly talking about himself and his achievements. After listening to the secret on audio, this was just a bit boring. But hey maybe it gets better further on."
1,Forget it,Someone showed me this which I read through pretty quick...If you actually want to read something that does bring results check outHow To Get Everything You Ever Wanted: Complete Guide to Using Your Psychic Common SenseIts far far better and actually does bring results. I have read other books by the so called *Dr* Joe Vitale and most of them are just cheap ebooks that are sold on ebay with resell rights. His website hosts a ton of these marketing and 'how to become a millionaire' ebooks which are totally a waste of 'e-time'He is also linked to the secret book and dvd which in itself is a total joke given that recently in Australia contributors to this 'fad movie and book' are now under investigation for fraud. Google 'The Secret and Channel 9' on youtube to check it out...very very positive influences huh?Skip this book and check out also 'Creative visualization by shakti gawain also sold on amazon
1,Snake oil salesman,"This book was a total waste of time. It doesn't take a geniusto understand that Mr Vitale has got a lot of friends who arewriting glowing reviews to promote booksales, beware!Books on the same topic I'd recommend instead of this onewould be ""Your invisible power"" by Genevieve Behrendand ""The power of your subconscious mind"" by Dr. Joseph Murphy."
1,This book will not prepare you for the California Real Estate Brokers exam.,"If you are serious about passing and have the extra time and money, look into attending a live crash course.I am also looking into filing a complaint with the California Department of Real Estate because they use ""California"" in the title. Which may be a moot point because apparently the DRE will license any real estate training course that fills out an application.Finally, try to find books with your state as the focus. Most books get around the state issue by only providing generic nationally used questions which will only prepare you for roughly half of a state exam.Incidentally, also, be weary of Barron's real estate series. The business dictionary is great but the Real Estate Licensing Exams book, Dictionary of Real Estate Terms book, and Economics are light on content."
1,This book is unreliable,There are review questions which do not match the text in the chapters. I do not know whether to trust the content.
1,most worthless book EVAR!!!,this book is nowhere close to the exam. if you're looking for practice exams similar to the california real estate sales/broker exams then look elsewhere.
2,Not detailed enough for broker exam,"It might be great for the salesperson exam, but it just doesn't have the detail for the brokers exam. I have to take the test again."
2,Barron's CA RE Exams Preparation book,"This is a great book for the preparation for the Real Estate Exam. The Autors really have a practical way with the material. The study method is describ in detail and openly they just tell you how it is going to be. It is almost funny how they just tell you the facts of what to expect. Read it from ""FRONT to BACK"" or you will miss the juicy details that will make you successfull at studying and passing the exam, whatever the choice or need be, Real Estate Salesperson, Broker or Appraiser. I have study plenty, and passed many Exams and this book is one of the BEST that there is, clearly a MUST."
5,Excellent!! Very easy step by step training.,"We purchased this DVD and I can honestly tell you... we purchased several other training DVD's and books but NONE of them come near as clear and simple as this DVD.The trainer shows you each command with 3 totally different dogs (trained, untrained and semi-trained) so she can show us how to handle various situations that arise. It is as if you are in a class with your dog.We play the session we're working on.... watch her do it, then pause the DVD, try it on our pups about 4-5 times.... then resume playing DVD, on to next step.It is MUCH cheaper than obedience classes elsewhere. Anyone can train their dog using this DVD.... honestly!"
5,Awesome! Need another album!,I found out about 10 Second Drop from a paintball video - NPPL Super 7 Series Las Vegas 2004. I loved the song they played (Blame.....It's All On Me) and searched all over for the CD. Thanks to Amazon for having the MP3 version!
2,weak effort,"While i was out picking up the new edgewater cd (which is good), I came across 10 second drop's debut. I hadn't actually heard anything by these guys, but I recognized the name (they're signed to the same label as edgewater), so I bought the cd. Big mistake. I've heard this sound a million times before, and although there are plenty of bands that will continue to do it, 10 second drop just aren't captivating enough. It's generic hard rock without any sort of edge or memorable angle. One of my favorite bands just so happens to be Nickelback, so if you think I'm hating on 10SD because they play basic rock and roll, think again.I wanted to like these guys, but no luck. They're just not that good."
3,The Doctor and Leela take on death personified,"Strangely enough, after the first appearance of K9, the very next story sees him in for repairs (the first of several times!). Instead, we have the Doctor and Leela arrive on present day England after being pulled through a hole in the space-time continuum. This is being caused by a Time Scanner being used to probe the origins of an apparently human skull, but one which is from a time some eight million years before mankind evolved.There is an ancient power at work, and the Doctor must deal with it to prevent the end of the world...Chris Boucher is reasonably on form with this story (but not as good as 'Robots of Death') and the adaptation by Terrance Dicks is, while not inspiring, quite reasonable. The main advantage of this story is that some of the special effects in the TV serial were none-too-special.You may also wish to read this book as background to the eighth Doctor novel, 'The Taking of Planet 5'."
4,excellant!!!,"Fiddler on the Roof is one of my favorite musicals!! This contains all the vocal numbers, and the piano part is not too difficult."
5,One of the very best books I have ever read.,"This is one of the best sttories I havde ever read. It is about a Jewish community in rural Russia trying to keep their traditional way of life durring thee russian revolution. I think the characters are very realistic and I think this story is one of the most imaginative books in the world. I esspecially like the way Tevye makes up quotaations from the Bible in order to teach his children a lesson. I also find the way the entire town of Anatevka acts. In short, i hearttilly recomend this book to anyone who likes a good story that is funny and an exiting read."
4,Pretty darn sharp,"Well, these knives start discoloring pretty much right away, as they are supposed to.Who cares??? Unless you're a TV chef, pick up a couple of these babies. They hold an excellent edge and feel pretty good in the hand (but not great).My Henckels are more comfortable, but I have been using the carbons almost exclusively since they landed on the step six weeks ago. (I also bought a boning knife.) They feel like serious knives, more professional than most of the upscale blades I've tried. They're certainly easier to control, more finesse. Sharp is better."
3,Good show,"I was going to buy the summer vacation video because it got such good reviews but unfortunately it's $45 here so i picked this one up instead.The show,although short ,is very good with a lot of enthusiasm and energy.Her voice was excellent and the guitar work was great.The sound is suspect with it sounding like the mics were placed back in the corners of the auditorum or something.After awhile i got used to it.Camerawork was ok .Very few audience shots though.Pat mentioned at one pt that the show was being taped for hbo so maybe they cheaped out because it was just for tv audience originally ."
3,Not her best concert,"This concert is from the Get Nervous tour, at the height of Pat's popularity and before a series of weak albums that eventually drove her to obscurity. It contains many of her old classics, though contrary to the DVD cover, there are only 13 songs on the hour long DVD. The concert was recorded for an HBO special.Pat was not in very good voice at New Haven that night. Sounded like she should have warmed up before hand. She was weak in the first few songs, having trouble hitting or holding the high notes. She got better as things wore on and was herself in the middle. She again seams to fade towards the end of the concert. As a professionally trained singer, she should have known beter than this. She was not as strong as she was just this past summer at the outdoor concert in Albany NY, nearly 20 years later.An enjoyable performance, but not as good as her studio albums or her other recorded concerts."
4,"Sound & Picture are good, remember it's about 20 years old!",This is a great show with a good mix of tunes; no extras but that's fine since it was only [price] new in a store. The band is in their prime and every song is good and played tight. People complaining about the picture/sound don't seem to realize this was shot in 1983!
1,Rhino Lets Pat Down,I'm a big fan of Pat Benatar but this DVD is really poor. The light and sound are really poor quality. The energy level doesn't compare to her other live performances - probably because of the flow of the selections. And it's only about an hour long. Pat is great - but this DVD is certainly not her finest hour - not the way it's presented.
2,"Good Performance, Bad Sound","I have to tell I really liked this show, but Neil Geraldo's guitar sounds like it's on the Moon...you cant hear it. Since I am big fan of Neil and a player myself, I found this VERY dissapointing. It really takes away from an otherwise great show. Unfortunatley, this one wont see much playing time. I advise you to steer clear."
3,Maybe net year,"I like the concept of this puzzle but it is more difficult than I expected. I bought as a Christmas gift for my son, who turned four in December. He loves puzzles but this one is too hard for him right now. I put it away and maybe Santa will bring it again next year.I think he will really like eventually....just not right now!"
2,Cute idea but too little in the box...,"This concept is a great for little kids. Personally I think it is geared towards ages 2-4 yrs. Problem is, there are only so many pieces and it took my daughter 2 times to memorize the game. She was 3 and I found it too easy for her. She loves I Spy but this game isn't worth it. Get the momory game instead"
2,Too easy to memorize,"My 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times. Our version did not include the ""5 ways to play"" as stated on the box. (I've requested a copy from Briarpatch.) My 4 year old - who received the gift - lost interest after the first time he played. Both of my boys LOVE the ""I Spy"" and ""Can You See What I See"" books. This game just wasn't challenging enough for them."
2,Easily memorized,I agree with the other reviewers that the small number of puzzles made it too easy to memorize the solutions. My kids enjoyed this game the first time but had no interest in it again until several months later when they again enjoyed it for one round. Not worth the money.
3,much too easy for my 3yo,"I'm going to save this toy for my newborn daughter when she turns 18mos old, since my 3yo twin boys found this game MUCH too easy and got bored in less than five minutes. The quality of the cardboard is great, thick and sturdy, and comes in a great carry-along twin. Unfortunately, the game itself didn't pose much of a challenge for the recommended age range."
2,TOO EASY,"My son is 2 and we got him this for a good indoor on a rainy day game, however, it only took him 2-3 times in playing it to have it memorized. There are not that many pieces in the box and it didn't take long at all for him to get bored. I tried mixing it up and making up different games with it, but he lost interest the second day. Now it just sits there in the box. I recommend saving your money on this game and just purchasing ""memory"" or a simple deck of cards."
4,perfect for camping!,"Coleman has always made quality, reliable products, and has been a name that my family and I have come to trust for camping and outdoor gear. The Coleman kids sleeping bag is versatile and comfortable, and definitely insulates and keeps you warm- my younger brother commented on this as he used it every night we camped in Yellowstone this past summer. (for those of you who didn't know it, nightly temperatures in Yellowstone can dip to the low 40s, even lower, during summer) This is a good deal for those who want a sleeping bag that's durable and definitely serves a purpose, unlike so many of the disney/cartoon themed light sleeping bags you find that are good only for sleepovers and indoor use. The stuff sack is useful for stowing away items that may be needed throughout the night, like smaller flashlights."
2,A rush job,"The first 75% of the book deals with plain HTML, forms and other buttons and takes one from 0 to 5 on a scale to 1000. A lot of space wasted on mechanical clicking around the interface. Explain the menus and options and how to use them and don't need to walk through each one as if I've never seen a mouse. Now, if all you want in a web site is a bunch of words, links and pictures, all you need is MS Word and then Save as HTML. So, I imagine the fun part is when you have a database, to make the site smart... The database examples have missing steps and built in assumptions, no clue as to what could go wrong, etc. Needless to say, I spent many hours searching the net to fill the missing spaces left by this book. To my surprise, I found Macromedia's ONLINE UltraDev help a much better resource, with better explanations and a lot more graphics. Thanks Jannine, but no thanks!"
4,Borges for Beginners,"Jorge Borges, (1899-1986) was born in Beunos Aires and educated in Geneva, and was a prominent figure in the avant-garde Ultraist movement in the late teens and early 1920's. This book, a slim and highly cerebral volume which uses a theoretical library as a metaphor for the universe, with each volume a soul, each shelf an ideal, and perhaps curated by The Divine Ethereal, is a magnificent tour-de-force, yes, but is also highly accessible and certainly a viable choice for those of you who are new to Borges. His other fictional and non-fictional work can be very meaty and sometimes too complex. This particular edition, illustrated with gorgeous plates by the Moroccan printmaker Erik Desmazieres, is a marvelous addition to any serious library."
3,Highlighted at the San Diego Museum of Art,"I am anxious to read this book after puzzling over an exhibit in the San Diego Museum of Art for hours on end. This exhibit (March 8-June 22, 2008) is a reinterpretation of the book and is quite fascinating, although disturbing since it is wildly out of context."
2,A good idea poorly implemented,"The cover blurbs of this book are deceptive; it neither about messages from angels nor about sex-magick. It is basically a step-by-step ""grimoire"" for an imaginary temple constructed from the elements of the Enochian ""Great Table"". There is nothing wrong with the basic idea, but the book is marred by (among many other things) the use of Schueler's private system of correspondences, by his preference for ""Calls"" of his own devising rather than those given to Dee, and by his questionable system of making god-names out of the names of angels. The student would be better off -- and probably safer -- taking the basic idea and revamping it to fit more closely to the original material."
2,"Deceptive Title, Complicated","I found that the title was very deceptive. Instead of what you would think, it was not a guide to ascension to Divine Union, but rather a complicated set of instructions for constructing a temple or something...to tell the truth, I couldn't understand alot of it and didn't finish the book. I have seen some other things the Schueler's have put out and I question their accuracy in thier information. I suggest reading works by John Dee and know the basics before reading this book."
2,"Warning, this book may be dangerous...","Gerald Schueler has made his own enockian system wich has completely destryed my life. These rituals are extremely powerfull and dangerous. I suffer from cronic schizophrenia due to enockian rituals. These beings want nothing but to destroy humanity.....Once you go up in the higher spheres, there's no going down..In this book Schueler portrays his pathwork to the abyss of the univerce and the end of humanity. This material is made to kill innocent people. Mary"
5,Mandy has one week to find four homes for Walton's kittens,"Walton, a stray cat who lives by mandy's school has kittens in Mr. Williams laundry basket, on his best blue shirt. If Mandy and James move the kittens Walton might abandon them. But Mr. Williams says ""one week!"" What can Mandy do? Will one week be enough time to find four wonderful homes for her precious kitten pals; Eric, Amy, Patches, and Smokey? If you love animals I really think you should read Kittens in the kitchen."
5,The Magic of the Heart,"This is an exquisite collection of Gurumayi's reflections on Divine Love. I enjoy randomly opening it, and as I read the word's, I feel the pure, transforming energy of the words ""magically"" infuse the world around me with a brighter, more vibrant light!"
1,WORST EVER PURCHASE WILL NEVER BUY,"WORSE PRODUCT ,WILL N EVER RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY ONE ,WORSE PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASE NOT ONLY I HAVE BAD EXPIRIANCE FROM COMPANY WHOM ,THEY CALL ME TO HAVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW REMOVED THEY PROMISE TO HELP ME TO MEET MY NEED, THEY NEVER HOLD THE END OFF THER WORLD.

2,Funk for ABSOLUTE beginners...,"Since the original FUNK came out by Rickey Vincent some 5-6 years ago, a lot of people have tried to jump on the funky bandwagon. Thompson's book is just the latest and nowhere near the greatest. Basically, this is a book by someone who likens funkiness with how danceable the music is. However, this is only scratching the surface. THE FUNK is much deeper than that, and it seems that Thompson--like a lot of musical commentators whose expertise lies OUTSIDE the realm of FUNK--doesn't realize it.Thompson's a fish out of water. If there is a plus with this book, it's that there is a discography. If you're looking to ""get into the funk"" and are an absolute beginner, this might be a great starting point. If you know the difference between ""disco"" and funk, are looking for some DEPTH, and are a serious FUNKATEER, don't even waste your time with this book...unless you need access to a discography or something like that."
4,small parts,"Tis had many small parts and you have to buy the paint for it yourself. It's not as easy to put together as it would appear, oh, and you need your own modeling glue. I've put together a few models in my day and this one wasn't so great to work with. It's good, but not great."
4,A Book for Vegetarians Everywhere,"The story is offbeat and rather touching: The chickens who live on the Tweedy Farm are doomed to be made into chicken pies if they stay there much longer! Ginger, a clever hen desperate to feel of green grass under her feet, hatches escape plan after escape with no luck....until Rocky, a dashing rooster, literally flies into her life! Will these chicks ever escape the evil farm with their feathers still intact?The book is a simple retelling of the irreverent film and is easy reading for the younger set. It's sweet, gloriously silly and a wonderful companion to the film. I especially enjoyed the claymation pictures which do a wonderful job of capturing the moment with just one glance. I'd read it to you kids at bedtime.One side effect though -- don't be surprised if your kids refuse to eat poultry after reading this book!"
5,A wonderful collection of full-color photos,"Mississippi residents, fans of old Southern architecture, and enthusiasts of American architectural heritage alike have a wonderful collection of full-color photos by Mary Rose Carter and accompanying historical background by Mary Carol Miller in Great Houses Of Mississippi. Miller's lively stories of the houses, their families, and their cultural mark accompany nearly a hundred full-color images of house exteriors. This is a vivid and highly recommended collection of grand old homes."
5,Great Houses of Mississippi,"I saw a copy of this book in an assisted-living nursing home and just had to have a copy of it. I was not disappointed! The book was in mint condition. Even the dust cover appeared new. And the contents brought back many memories of our years in the state of Mississippi. Several of the houses featured were about 20 miles down the road from our home in Gloster, Mississippi in the town of Woodville. Many more were in Natchez, Mississippi (about 50 miles away). These beautifully preserved old mansions are our connection to the past in Mississippi. I am very likely to purchase other publications by these authors."
1,Old CD and out of date for newer PC's.....of no value since unable to run on windows xp or 7,Worst purchase ever as the product is very outdated to operate on newer pc's. Version is of an unusual format not read by O/S for windows xp or windows 7.Would certainly not have spent the money if I knew the format was old and outdated. A rip-off and I will not purchase items like this again.
3,proclama ecologista con mediocre valor literario,"Una novela cortita, fácil de leer, que en un primer momento te da la impresión de ser mejor de lo que en realidad es. El argumento es sencillo: el protagonista (el ""viejo"" del título) es un colono que se muda de la sierra a la selva para escapar de habladurías. Circunstancias de la vida hacen que conviva con los indios shuar durante muchos años, en los que aprende todo lo que hay que aprender sobre la selva y sus habitantes, humanos, animales y vegetales. La novela ofrece buenas imágenes de la vida en la frontera, y sus gentes. La descripción de la fauna es muy detallada. Al fin y al cabo esta novela es una proclama ecologista que pone en evidencia la mala gestión y el abuso que hacemos de la naturaleza. Desde un punto de vista literario, sin embargo, la historia es medio flojita, pero el lenguaje y la trama son simples, llanos."
5,"""Un viejo que leía novelas de amor""","Para ser sincero, este libro no nos gustó en lo más mínimo. Se trata de un hombre que va a atender a la selva a una tribu llamada Los Jíbaros. Mientras estaba allí encuentra una tigresa que amenaza al pueblo El Idilio. Antonio José Bolívar Proaño tiene que matar una tigrilla para el bien del pueblo y su propia vida. Él logra hacer este acto y salva al pueblo El Idilio. Antonio José Bolívar Proaño leía novelas de amor para pasar el tiempo. Su mujer, Dolores Encarnación del Santísimo Sacramento murió al poco tiempo de llegar a la selva amazónica. Esta historia cuenta también como se relaciona con la naturaleza y se da cuenta en que forma el hombre la destruye. Solamente se trata de eso y no crea ningún interés en nuestras mentes, además es excesivamente descriptivo a la hora de presentar un personaje o una escena."
1,Escrito con el ojo en la plata,"Leí este libro rápido y, por desgracia, aún no puedo olvidarlo por completo. Lo que recuerdo, eso sí, es infame: historia predecible, personajes de cartón, sonsonete impostado de autores conocidos, una novela hecha con elementos estereotipados y vendibles acerca de la ""realidad"" latinoamericana. Con un ecologismo de afiche y un saborcillo a El viejo y el mar que ha llevado a muchos a comparar ambos libros, lo que me parece altamente injusto. Hemingway era un profesional, Sepúlveda se defiende pero debería pasarse directamente al best-seller y dejar de hacer estos híbridos penosos."
1,"Sabatier Au Carbone 6"" Filet Knife",I have had a complete set of Sabatier Knives for over twenty years and they still Shine like new and hold an edge. I was excited to see this filet knife as I did not have one in my set. My wife put it in the sink to wash for the first time this am and it turned black and no polish would return its sheen. I also noted that it did not bear the Lion Logo or any logo what soever.All our other Sabatier knives are clearly marked with their Logo.Ken WestcottUnhappy in Oregon
5,Veronica's horse goes for red instead of blue!!,"I really liked this book because Veronica said something mean to Emily but Veronica's mean words backfired. Her horse, Go For Blue, was not perfect because he took a step at the finish line when he wasn't supposed to and Veronica and her horse lost."
5,Great stove!,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday in April. We used it in June/July for camping since there are no fire bans all over Arizona. It boiled water super fast! We were able to use both burners at the same time and still have dinner done within a timely manner. Didnt even go through one bottle of propane and we were camping for 4 full days only using this stove.Great stove! Would recommend. Cheapest place to buy is amazon, no shipping charge and no tax."
3,Just a good stove,Work OK but the burner control is some what touchy. Cant control the flame as good as my other Coleman stove.
5,Hooray for Stove,"The Coleman Two-Burner gets hot very quickly, and although I'm not sure how long the propane fuel will last, this stove seems very similar to one I used to use which got pretty good mileage out of the tanks.This model doesn't have the insta-light feature, but I've never been afraid of lighting this thing up with matches so all is well.As far as weight/size I think it's pretty reasonable. I will certainly be taking this camping and have no fears of it fitting comfortably in the trunk with the other gear."
2,Useless in Europe,This is really useless in Europe. I bought it in the U.S. but have never used it in Europe. It is extremely difficult to get Coleman propane gases in Europe.
4,Great all around stove,"I owned this model stove for many years and it provided reliable service. A nice thing about a propane stove is that it can be used indoors with relative safety if there is a power outage. However, one red flag. The aluminum drip pan is almost impossible to clean, should something spill over. I made the mistake of using oven cleaner on my old stove and the residue quickly turn the stove into a rust heap. My fault - not the stove's. But still, it seems that Coleman could use an improved material to catch the spills and be easy to clean up."
1,bad one from Coleman!,Bought this as a gift for my nephew. He just tried it out on a camping trip this past weekend. there was NO way to regulate the flame! It shot straight up - either full on or full off - no knobs to control. Made it very difficult for cooking. Is this just a bad one or can it be fixed/replaced?
3,Works for smaller needs...,"We have this, but with a larger family, it is really slow going. Doing a LOT of food on a campout with lots of kids and hungry people -- you'll be cooking for a long time. Go for an item with higher BTU's that you can just crank up and get it done.... With a couple of people, okay to use, but it does take time to even just heat water. Plan for heat it up dishes that don't need cooking time."
3,coleman two-burner propane stove,"Not as good I was thinking it would be, very hard to get a steady low flame, needed to put a toothpick between the control knob and the stove base to get a low flame.Even as I gave this only three stars, I hope this stove will last as long as the one it replaced."
2,"Worked twice, two stars...","It worked on two camping trips, then on the third it produced dangerous flames about 3 feet high. I examined it and saw no visible clogging/dirt, etc... I'll likely disassemble and attempt to fix but it seemed clear that nothing was on fire. I believe whatever regulator this has built in is malfunctioning."
5,Compact and Reliable,"I was a boy scout from the age of 10 right up until I got my Eagle at 18. My camp kitchen was outfitted with this stove. It was several years old when I got it, and then my patrol cooked well over 500 meals on this stove over the course of 8 years, and now it is still in use with another group of kids.It is inexpensive, simple, and reliable. For the size, it gives off a good amount of heat. It is not a good choice for boiling large quantities of water or any other job that requires bringing out the big guns. My favorite use for this stove is to throw down a double-wide cast iron skillet across the burners for making pancakes, hashbrowns, and omelettes."
2,As long as your fine with one setting,"As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit. You see, the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings. No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water, a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast. My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one), and it worked great. You're on the right track, but keep looking...stay with propane, but away from this model. I've seen others comment with this same concern, so it is a quality control/product issue. C'mon Coleman...build it US, build it right."
4,Great for car camping,The Coleman two-burner stove lived up to our expectations! It's so much fun to cook on...and easy. Didn't even need to read the directions. Highly recommend if you're looking for a durable and sturdy camping stove.
1,Gas flow problems,"This is our third Coleman stove in over 20 years - a testament to their strength and reliability. However, it was immediately apparent that this new stove was not of the same high quality of our previous stoves. Sheet metal was thinner, the cover didn't fit right, and the latches and hinges were obviously weaker and cheaply constructed. However, the most frustrating thing about this stove is gas flow control. The gas regulation drifts terribly, constantly increasing flow. If you set low, within a minute the flame is roaring at maximum. You must constantly monitor and adjust the flame. I would not recommend this stove."
5,Buy this stove!,Wow! What a great stove. I have a really old one that still works well. I bought this for my son and I would recommend this stove for sure! The burners are awesome!
5,Works great!,I used a friends stove and loved it so much i got one for us! It works great! Make sure to have a long lighter or long matches to light it with. It does cook a little on the faster side so beware...but i love this and recommend it highly!
1,Cokleman 2 burner stove,Surprised at the poor quality. Not like the old coleman stoves. One hinge was completely loose due to 2 rivets pulled out. The whole thing is rivited together. The only thing that resembles anything like the old Coleman stoves is the color. Very poorly put together and very flimsy.
1,Shoddy construction,"Having seen many of these over the years, this particular model is really shoddily made. The first one was damaged on arrival (with no damage to box), so I couldn't even get the top open. The second one came, and was also damaged (but less so). The silvery metal is not attached well at all to the green base and there is glue all over it (clearly where it was supposed to be held down. What a piece of junk!"
3,Coleman Propane Camp Stove,"The stove is compact, light weight, easy to set up, and throws out a lot of heat. It's also a wonderful base for theColeman 5010D700T Camp Oven. In our experience, the burner has basically two settings...high and higher...which is great if the main thing you want to do is boil water. We like a little more sophistication in our camp cuisine, however, and it's almost impossible to get the flame low enough to simmer or simply keep things warm. This is our second stove and we use it primarily to boil water for veggies, shrimp, etc. and heating the dishwater on one burner while the second burner runs the oven. So, it's great as a second stove but I'd be very frustrated if I had to rely on it for main cooking duties."
4,"simple, reliable, lightweight","This stove is perfect for camping. It has low weight, yet is very sturdy where it counts, like the cooking grid and pan and burner assemblies. I don't need my camp stove to be pretty and overbuilt, it lights no problem with a long grill lighter. The flow control is easy and I had no problem achieving a wide range of heat levels. The knobs have smooth motion and feel solid when reaching the off position. Don't expect the feel and performance of your home gas range, this is a camping stove. The only change I would make is to have a flexible hose for the propane cylinder, It might be difficult to find a perfectly flat surface for the stove/regulator/tank to rest on. There are flexible hoses with regulators that will fit this stove."
3,"a new meaning to ""implausible""","Ok some kickass action, BUT, my word it is so implausible! The bad guy is so obsessed with eliminating Chuckee, they know exactly where to find his swamp house, they go to all the trouble of of going there, blowing it up to kill him, and you would think they'd take the trouble of getting out of their swampmobiles to check if he's really dead. But noooo, they drive away. Stupid. The whole thing is dotted with rediculous contradictions to logic. Switch off your brain when watching."
1,dont tell chuck,one of the worst movies that chuck norris made. shhhh. dont let him know. so fake.could not stand to watch the ending.
2,vintage Chuck Norris,"One of Chuck Norris's better known movies; TBS has shown this countless times. It doesn't really get better with age though. Not Chuck's best movie but better than several of the real duds like Forced Vengeance and Good Guys Wear Black. It's Chuck against the Russkies who invade his homeland and really tee him off. No real extras on the DVD, just the movie. Action is not really memorable in this movie, and it's pretty unbelievable even for a Chuck movie. But, if you're a Chuck fan, this one is a must because it's got a few classic Chuck one-liners."
2,Not nearly as good as they say,"This is a pretty ridicoluos film. An ugly man with ugly blondhair want's to take over Florida, or something like that. But he'sscared of Chuck Norris, his old enemy. A VEEEERY stupid plot. There'sto little action in the movie (although the carchase troughout the mall is pretty cool). Chuck hardly fights at all. The final fight with the crook is quite good, but it should be MUCH longer than it is. In the whole it's not a very good film."
5,preserving the memories,I bought this movie because my daughter was in it. It was filmed in Atlanta Georgia and she was 7 years old at the time. I wanted her to have a copy to keep for the grandchildren if we ever have them.
5,ROCK!,"This movie is just outright, violent fun... if you like blowing people and stuff up, this is it... no comparison. You have to buy a movie where Chuck Norris uses two uzis and blows away people with a rocket launcher."
5,Good Transfer of a Good Movie,"I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time and it was worth the wait. Chuck Norris is at it again, defending the free world and bringing down the bad guys. If you like the average action movie, you'll love this as it is an outstanding example of the genre.MGM Gave this movie a pretty good transfer treatment, a fully anamorphic widescreen transfer with actual surround sound. Not bad for a 16 year old film that wasn't a blockbuster. Not much in the extras department, but digging up a widescreen trailer for the film is better than the nothing that they've given with some films.All in all a good, satisfying Chuck Norris movie and a great value DVD purchase."
1,Poor quality/ service,Received the pendant twisted. It required untwisting with moderate force. I feared it would break. The chain did break with one wearing. Tried to return it but was only offered a refund. I like the pendant. I will keep it and get a new chain only because this was a gift from my husband.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Here, Harry Osborn is back at school. His father is not a nice crazy green mini-hulk kind of guy. Nick Fury puts in an appearance at Peter's high school at tells young Spidey they are watching the whacko.They are illegally spying on him and know that he has threatened violence and mayhem and murder, but they are waiting for him to do it publicly with evidence, so web-boy is on his own until then."
2,not a good country,"i must say: i really liked his writing style. so i hoped and hoped. but no. the stories here aren't much of stories. seem like confusion on paper. i'm afraid i must demand plots, ideas. i know i'm being unclear, but that's because the author is too. the way he carries out the story, you sometimes wonder what you are reading about"
2,My first book by Etchison,"This author has always baffled me!? I just don't understand what he is trying to do, does he write dark psychological horror with some sort of underlying deep message? if so he's not succeeding. I can't stand authors that write cloudy vague(here you figure it out) endings either. His books just aren't scary and I've read many since ""The Dark Country"" if you have insomnia read this book it put's me to sleep within 10 min. of picking it up, that's hard to do."
1,Stephen King recommended this lame stuff ?,can't believe the king of horror would recommend this lame sheet.ooooooooooo i was SO scared ! Don't waste your time or money.
1,Farner Fell Off His Horse One too Many Times.,"Don't waste your money on this rag. The book is hard to follow, and many of the things written about are highly questionable."
4,Worth Every Funky Moment,"FROM Grand Funk To Grace is a dream come true for anyone who is a Grand Funk fan, a classic rock fan, and a reader who loves to read about people who believe in themselves. Not only does Farner truthfully spill the beans on his past, present, and future, but he has been lauded along the way by numerous other peers in his field. It's too bad that Funk drummer Don Brewer didn't seem to want to take part in this book, as it would have made it the ultimate handbook for classic rock. However, from legendary guitarist Dick Wagner to Eddie Van Halen and even Funk's own Craig Frost, one can't deny the impact of Farner's life, career, and legendary status based on the stories, the IRS problems, and Farner's own unique vision and positivity. Englehardt nailed a great document, one that will be passed along from music lover to music lover for generations to come. Long live Farner and the Funk..."
5,Behind the scenes look at Grand Funk's driving force,"A wonderful timeline account of the rags to riches story of the engine that drove Grand Funk to top of the music world in the early 70's.Mark Farner is not your typical rock-star.He is a man's man who even though he made millions,had fame,and many tests and trials through shady managers and agents and IRS troubles,has today kept his feet on the ground and lives a righteous existence through his born-again faith.Today Mark is a rock-patriot,spouting values from our forefathers and living a life through Christ.He does early Grand Funk songs,Christian,and positive-message music at his shows.The book tells how he came from humble beginnings,many humorous tales of growing-up experiences,and his musical influences as well as many never before told stories of life with Grand Funk Railroad.Included are many never-published photos of Mark's life.A must have for any serious fan."
1,An egomaniac tells half truths,"I found the book to be poorly written, very hard to read and focus on. It tells how much of an an egomaniac Mark Farner truly is. He believes he is Grand Funk Railroad all by himself. He is also a draft dodger and a so called patriot, when in fact he appears to be person who wants to overthrow our system of government via an armed revolution. He claims to be a Christian, yet his brand of Chrstianity is not the norm."
3,cute and unique,"Ernest is a crowd pleaser at our house... with performances almost nightly. It's a unique toy - nothing else like him in our toy repitoire. He was easy to assemble. I do wish he had a little more punch in that he would run the line a little more fluently. He doesn't seem to go whole lot further than where we stop the pushing motion, or rebound back down the line once he hits the end. Perhaps this is line contingent and we've not given him a good set-up but if that's the case I wish there were more directions with the toy as the instructions for effective hanging are almost none. Still, the kids don't seem to mind at all. They are captivated by his daring performances each night."
1,DOA?,"The CMOS battery was apparently dead on arrival. At least when I installed it in my 600X laptop, it did not retain date or time. Too much trouble to return it for replacement, but I'll avoid dealing with this vendor."
5,Correct battery for original Thinkpad 600 model 2645,"I was given a stack of Thinkpad 600 model 2645 laptops all with the same error. I wanted to build basic workstations using DSL Linux, so I ordered a bunch of these. All errors fixed now, and all I need to do is figure out how to get x to come up right.A note about the negative reviews. It looks like IBM changed the polarity on the battery connector for later model 600 laptops. Look at your battery and compare with the picture for this item."
2,Wrong battery,"Although the description was correct, the battery was not the right one for my IBM 600X. The polarity is reversed at the connector, compared to the original battery."
1,battery dead after 4 months,i got this battery in march and now i need to take my laptop on a trip for tomorrow and the battery is dead. what did you send me a used battery? what the deal can you please give me another battery.
2,Difficult for the beginning stats student,"I have used this text in multiple sections of introductory statistics for MBA students, and I have found that it is difficult for the students to follow. Other business statistics texts provide far more easy to follow instruction (e.g., see Mason and Lind's book). This book is a bit too oriented toward the use of statistics in finance (especially for the student who may not have yet had his or her first finance or economics course). I originally adopted it for its integration of Excel as an analysis tool, but its use did not make up for the poor organization and presentation of topics. From the students' perspective -- hands down, they hate it."
4,"good, but not exhaustive","this is a good resource, but I there are so many better keywords in my opinion that are just ignored. a slight disappointment."
2,Quite diluted,"If you were raised in the school of the Barclays and Vines, then skip this book and the series. This in no way compares to those masterly books which dissect words in the Bible with such dept providing information for you to meditate and chew on. Rather this book and others in the word study series lack dept, they give metrics such as how many times the word appeared in the various books of the bible but i don't see a knowledge of the greek or hebrew culture or environment which will give me more inside into why that word was chosen by the writer. God will use the imagery associated with the various words in the writer's mind to convey the thoughts in his mind. I expect word books to provide that kind of data, i did not get it with these word study books."
5,"Exactly what I needed, relatively easy to install","The price on this ICM from Delphi is great (My shop quoted me nearly double). It came with two pillow packs of lithium (or silicone?) grease for coating the terminals before you put the coil packs back on (very helpful!). Fairly easy to install, just take the coil packs off and then remove the old ICM. I made the mistake of removing the whole unit (coil packs, ICM, and mounting plate, and it was a little tough to get back on, but still not too bad. Thanks for the price Amazon!"
2,OK if you are American,"This book intends to be a complete guide to organising your wedding in a Catholic church. The selection of possible readings, and some of the ideas on how to organise the ceremony are fine. However if you are getting married in Britain (as opposed to America, where the book was written) you have very little leeway about the vows as they are covered by Act of Parliament. The ""light-hearted"", jokey style gets a bit irratating after a while too. From personal experience of organising my own wedding in a Catholic church this year, I'd forget the book and talk to your priest instead."
2,This book was an embarassment to Catholics.,"This book is inappropriate for anyone in a serious search to bring Catholicism into their wedding celebration. It also is offensive to modern Catholics, who would not consider asking for a dispensation of marriage from the Bishop if the other party is Christian, but not Catholic.Offering loosely translated biblical text, such as ""gee you look nice"", and advice on ""frequently asked questions"" such as ""Is it a good idea to chew gum during the wedding?,"" I was embarrased for all Catholics reading this text. Buy it only for humorous value."
5,Outstanding! Thank you!,"Penn & Teller have done it again. Okay, they love knocking down the occasional straw man to make it funny, but it's still good, libertarian skepticism. Well worth the time, and the money!"
4,Still a great show,"Some reviewers have complained that the quality of this season is markedly lower than its predecessors, so I ordered it under advisement. Thankfully, I found most of their complaints to be unwarranted---or at least exaggerated.True, in a couple of episodes, the strength of their argument seemed to be sacrificed to some extent to sheer entertainment value, such as the lesbian road trip in the hybrid car episode. But most of the episodes did a good job making their point, while also making fun of their opponents---something the show has always done. The Wal-Mart episode, the immigration episode, the ADA episode, and the nuclear power episode were all very well done. (Also, loved the gratuitous Ayn Rand plug in the anger management episode.)And the exorcism episode was hilarious."
4,Adult Humor,"Much swearing and nudity, but fun. The debunking of these sacred cow topics is a breath of fresh air. I am buying all seasons of this show as I can afford them."
4,BS Season 5,"More great entertainment from the thought-provoking mad geniuses. By now, you know what you're going to get from this series. Some insight, some over the top opinions, and a few good laughs. While I think the series is not as consistently great as it was in the beginning, I'll keep buying as long as they're producing."
2,Amazing Sound Quality that can't last,Pros: (1) Very good sound quality after breaking in.(2) Sound imaging is very good.(3) Clear sound(4) Fast responseCons: (1) Some part inside a panel speaker got loosen after 3 months. That resulted in some vibration noise when I turned up the volume a bit. **All 5 people I know who bought these speakers had the same problem.(2) Power socket at the back of the subwoofer easily had intermittent contact problem.(3) Not able to fill up a room larger than 200 sq feet with sound.
5,Great Sound for the Space it Occupies and the [Price],I first heard this set of speakers in CompUSA over a year ago. I was about three aisles away and could not believe the tremendous sound! I made an immediate purchase. I've had them ever since and still thoroughly enjoy them ! I find the base more than adaquate. A superb sound for something so little. I take them along with me when I travel and hook them to my notebook so I can share music with my friends -- they are always impressed. Great sound with DVD also.
3,"OK,nothing more","This is an acceptable rock soundtrack.The songs are unmemorable,but they suit the film.OK if you like this sort of thing."
5,Ample ass kicked on UNDERWORLD 2 Soundtrack!!,"Man, I thought they couldn't top themselves after the killer soundtrack to the first Underworld a couple years ago. But, daymn, did they pull it off again!The premiere solo track from Linkin's Chester, first new Maynard track in 2 years, My Chemical Romance remix by Danny from Nine Inch Nails and Wes from Limp...the list just goes on and on! In fact, every song I hear is exclusive to this record. Kudos to the producers and all the artists that stepped up and recorded some of their best 'ish for Underworld:evolution!"
3,movie vs soundtrack,"The soundtrack boasted some big names! I was excited to hear them all. But disappointed to hear the big bands let down. The best, and heaviest, song on this disk is by Mendozza, an independent band from Canada?!"
3,"Not as good as the first, but still worth it.","Not quite as brooding as the first, and quite a bit more headbanging. The Puscifer track is outstanding, the Slipknot track very quiet and haunting but still one of my favorites. The Alkaline Trio remix is also decent. But the first half of the disc is definitely better than the last. All of the songs on the last half sound the same, the gritty industrial screaming goth/punk thing is ok but gets old fast."
3,"Good, but not great...","I bought this soundtrack because of the DEEP love I have for the first one. I had high expectations, and I suppose that was my first mistake. The reason I liked the first soundtrack was because of the dark tone and the instrumental tracks. I thought it fit perfectly with the movie.This soundtrack is not as good as the first by any stretch of the imagination. The overabundance of ""punk"" bands worries me. The first three songs are excellent, and then it all goes downhill.Overall... buy a few tracks on iTunes. The entire album isn't worth your money."
3,Some good Some Bad,"What can i say about this album. Im a huge fan of NiN and love some of the remixes that start off the album but some of the later songs i have to say arent so great. Probably no one knows this but its killing me, the Senses Fall song starts off with music that sounds an awfully lot like another song. I cant remember what it is but if anyone does PLEASE TELL ME!!!!!!"
5,By far the best of the 2,"I have not been able to take this CD out of my stereo since I got it. I do have to say, however, that I'm not real fond of 2 songs on the soundtrack, but that may be because they both sound almost exactly the same. But I still love the album 5 stars worth. So in my opinion, this is by far the best of the 2. Dark, brooding, just the way I like it."
5,"Sweet, I loved it","The first soundtrack sucked, but this one was great. I really enjoyed it. The only songs that I really hated off this CD was:Vermillion PT 2Her Portrait in BlackWhy Are upHW2Other than that, I really loved this album. I think anyone who likes the movie should like the soundtrack."
2,Two SP Tracks Rejected For An Aiden Remix,What disappoints me the most is that there could have been another Skinny Puppy or new cEvin Key track on this. When cEvin sent in the two tracke he made the producers sent him back the Aiden track and asked him to remix it. The original Aiden song is basically just a horribly generic emo track. He does his best with it and it's interesting to see how he actually manages to make such a bad song somewhat listenable. The Puscifer track is also a highlight. Can't say I'm very impressed with this soundtrack as a whole.
2,Underwhelmed...,"I love Linda Eder's previous CDs and was very excited to purchase GOLD. I hate to say it, but I am totally underwhelmed. I know it's wrong to hope that every work from an artist will be like their others, but GOLD disappoints. I strongly prefer the big band, Broadway sounds of her previous CDs. What I had hoped would be in constant rotation in my CD player won't."
2,Not her best work,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of ""Gold"", as ""It's Time"" is one of my favorite CDs of all time. I was expecting (hoping for) another similar album. She has gone in a totally different and disappointing direction with ""Gold"". What a waste of a tremendous talent. Linda, please bring back the wonderful band and arrangements of your previous album!!"
3,A bit disappointed,"Linda is fairly new to me. I first heard her on Rosie singing Why Do People Fall In Love and a few weeks later on the CBS Morning show singing Vienna and both performances drew me in. While I have yet to buy that album (I promise I will), I thought I'd buy this one, having just come out and all. Well it's not quite what I expected. I expected to hear powerful songs that showed off a powerful voice, much like the 2 previously mentioned songs. What I got is a bit anti-climactic. Her Gypsy Heart seems un-Linda like. Linda is also too good to be covering as many songs as she did. A lot of the music seems to overpower her, as do the background vocals. Linda's voice can stand on its own, as is evident in the last 2 tracks, Gold and If I Had My Way. I'm not saying the songs are bad. They just don't seem to compliment Linda's lovely voice. Here's hoping another album is already in the works."
1,Disappointment,"After discovering Linda Eder, I promptly bought everything I could find and looked foward to her new cd, but this is such a disappointment. Her previous covers (Smile, Somewhere Over the Rainbow) were excellent, but her choice of songs on this cd and her orchestrations make this a cd I am sorry I bought. I look forward to her concert here in Mass, and hope she sings her old music. If you are new to Linda buy any of her other cds."
5,"""Gold"" : a real 70's feel","After listening to Linda Eder's ""Gold"" I was instantly brought back to Barbra Streisand's wonderful 70's period with classic albums like ""Butterfly"", ""Stoney End"" and ""Lazy Afternoon"". In my opinion this was a much overlooked segment of Streisand's career.I love the vibe on Eder's ""Gold"" -- Her voice is as rich as honey. This is the album I've been waiting for from Linda Eder. With songs like ""Son of a Preacher Man"" -- you cannot go wrong.My goal now : to see these done live.Thank you, Linda for putting out a sweet, lovely album in the dead of New England winter. I sure needed this!"
2,"Please, tell me no...","Having been an admittedly obsessed fan from the moment I first heard Linda's voice in Jekyll & Hyde, I've bought everything that she's done including songbooks, because the piano arrangements are even terrific! However, when I played this CD for the first time, I wanted to cry, ""Please tell me this is a joke!"" Some of the songs are good ones -- some of my personal faves, even -- but they do not fit her voice, nor the sophistication we've come to expect from her (stick to amazing ballads, broadway/standard repertoire, and good arrangements of them at least)....."
1,"Not worthy of even 1 star, let alone the gold medal.","I have loved every previous album of Linda Eder's and anxiously awaited the release of ""Gold"". She is immensely talented and deserves a better production effort than she received on this new CD. I can only describe it as an underproduced collection of forgetable tunes in the style of the early '70's. That is, way too much folk guitar, and unsophisticated percussion.It's overall feel is immature,monotonic, boring, and frankly, amateurish. Please, Linda, do a great album of standards or soon to be standards with the sophisticated,mature arrangements we have come to expect from as serious and talented an artist as you. I now await Linda's next effort with hope for a return to a grown up approach to fit her abilities."
2,Love The SInger;Hate the Songs,"Linda Eder is fantastically talented, one of the most beautiful, compelling voices ever BUT, once again, she has selected material unworthy of her talent. As another reviewer noted, it is very nice that she is in love with her husband, but his songwriting is not the equal to her talent. Much as I love her, I won't buy any more records dominated by his second rate material."
2,Not Up To her Standards-Yawn!,"I am very disappointed that I purchased this CD. I really only care for two songs--Here Comes the Sun, and Son of a Preacher Man (which is awesome!). I wouldn't recommend the CD. Too many slow, snoozer songs. However our whole family loves her Christmas albums--even a voice instructor was impressed enough to purchas it--and she is picky!!!"
1,who are you?,"What kind of songs are these?? some are country,pop and broadway!! not your best Linda !!! And why do Franks songs always sound like a bad version of someone elses??? For instance the hook in Until I Don't Love You Anymore is almost exactly Faith Hills Breathe. The Gypsy Love song sounds just like Cher's Come to Me Baby !!!! Of course Frank always puts his own music in between someone elses hook, or at least it sounds that way to me !!!! Check out the other albums and I'm sure you'll agree with me !!!!!!!!!! Sorry Linda but you need to wear more clothes on your album covers for a lady in your 40's its not appropriate !! I give this album 1 star only because there are no half stars allowed !!!!"
2,Fools Gold,"I love Linda Eder, but I just can't get behind this new CD. After listening for three weeks, the more I play it, the more I find myself skipping tracks. The title track GOLD, is a magnificent song and Linda's amazing voice is thrilling to hear. If I Had My Way, If I Should Lose My Way, We're All Alone, and Son Of A Preacher Man are all worthy of Linda's enormous talent. But the rest of this album goes downhill fast. Worst of all is the awful country music style Until I Don't Love You Anymore. I can't help but feel that this is somebody else's song that I've heard before, but I just can't place it. The duet How In The World, the cover of George Harrison's Here Comes The Sun, Across The Water (another awful song) are just ordinary material being performed by an extraordinary singer. I love Linda, but this album Gently Breaks My Heart."
2,Linda. Please!,"Linda Eder is a GREAT talent! That's obvious and, having said that,whoinhell is representing her?!As an old DJ type I would LOVE to have her record Rodgers & Hart, Hammerstein, Cole Porter etc & et al. (Man of La Mancha is a tour de force!)But HOW can I keep playing these second-rate songs while explaining to my audience ""She really IS a great singer.""If her husbands' career can't reach the heights WHY should SHE sacrifice HERS?!""Is a puzzlement!"""
2,Pop album????,"I bought this because there was a sticker on the front that read, ""Linda Eder's Pop Album"". I was curious. I listened to the first 2 tracks- and my opinion was some theatre people got together and made ""their version"" of what a pop album is. Reading some of these other reviews, it looks like other people feel the same way. Frank Wildhorn should not have had anything to do with this CD. He needs to get out of the way and let his wife fly. If Linda wants to go this new direction (and she definitely has the potential), she should surround herself with a team that knows what they're doing in the pop arena. No matter what she sings, it's BEAUTIFUL. But this CD is just too ""safe"". She needs to push herself beyond her comfort level. Is she would just take some risks, she'd have an incredible career."
4,Simply wonderful...,"This CD is Linda's best yet.. I can't listen to it enough.""You are My World"", ""Gently Break My Heart"" are just two of my many favorites..I highly recommend it. Bravo!!"
2,Not up to her usual standards,"I own every c.d. of Linda's and eagerly looked forward to this one. I'm sorry to say I was rather disappointed; unlike her other c.d.s, which are terrific and exciting, this one will just be sitting on my shelf. ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and ""Drift Away"" are unworthy of her wonderful talent; she does do a rather nice arrangement of ""Here Comes the Sun"", but this is a monotonous, boring song, again, not worth wasting time on. The title song is gorgeous, the only great cut on the c.d., and she sings it fabulously, but the other material is mostly forgettable. It seems as though now that Linda's becoming more popular and gaining a larger audience, she feels she has to lower her standards to please everyone. BIG MISTAKE!!! I'm just going to sweep this one under the rug and hope that in her next effort Linda returns to her usual level of excellence and impeccable taste."
4,sooo sweet,"a bit of a departure from her last 3 cd's, Linda Eder takes it to a different level and let's the sweetness of her voice blend with guitars and emotional arrangements. welcome new fans and a loving peck on the cheek for her old fans. thank you Linda for taking us flying again...an old fan...."
5,"Linda Eder, Who Knew?","I was nfmiliar with this artist until I heard and saw her on a PBS Special, ""Hallalujah Broadway"" where she sang ""Gold"". I did everything I could to find out more about Miss Eder and this unbeleivable song. She is stunning (outdoes Sriesand) and the song is UNBELIEVABLE! I want to sing a duet with this angel!!! singingtaylor9@yahoo.com"
2,So Disappointed,"I was terribly disappointed by this disc and Linda has one of my favorite voices in America today. Why oh why can't Atlantic Records see the mediocrity of Linda's association with Frank Wildhorn? If she must be married to him, that's fine. But why can't the record company at least get Linda better producers and better arrangements and most importantly, better material? Her potential is not being met. She needs to stop doing elevator worthy versions of Boz Skaggs and Beatles tunes and start developing stronger ties to good contemporary writers -- be they from the theatre world or from the pop idiom."
2,LINDA EDER IS A SUPER TALENT WHO NEEDS ANOTHER DIRECTION,"Linda Eder is one of my favorite contemporary singers, however, please get a grip on what is good! What a wasted voice on such mediocrity. LINDA PLEASE HOOK UP WITH OTHER PRODUCERS/SONGWRITERS! This woman is on the cusp of greatness, and platinum records, but even Rosie ODonnell and countless performances on Regis and the Today show cannot save this dud. Her other albums should be bought, this one should be shelved. I know she is in love with Frank Wildhorn, and I know he has produced incredible musicals, but she needs to work with someone else. Someone who knows how to produce a hit record, a radio-friendly record, not this ""material."" Atlantic will release ""Here Comes the Sun"" to an unready, and uninterested public. Push the marketing machine on catchy pop please. Show the world the instrument that is Eder's voice. Linda Eder will be without a loyal audience if she makes another ""GOLD"" mistake."
4,lots of hits... a few misses,"This isn't my favorite Linda Eder CD, but it's close. The best songs on the CD are the remake of ""Son of a Preacher Man,"" ""Gold,"" and ""If I Had My Way."""
2,Another disappointing CD from Linda Eder,"Linda Eder has the most fantastic voice I've heard in a long time. I have every CD she has put out and am continually disappointed by them. While her voice is wonderful on every song, the selection of songs chosen for her CDs is the main problem. Many of her songs are written by her husband, Frank Wildhorn, and while I loved the music he wrote for Jekyll & Hyde, the other songs just don't seem of the same caliber. Perhaps they are trying more for a mainstream hit but the songs just don't appeal to me. I would love a CD by Linda of Broadway songs which I believe would more fully show how wonderful her voice is. On the current CD, Gold is really the only song I like and that, of course, was written for their next musical (and used in the Winter Olympics opening ceremonies). If you are not familiar with Linda's voice, I would definitely suggest you try the Jekyll & Hyde CD which features Linda."
2,What a dissapointment,"As a huge Linda Eder fan I eagerly awaited this release, only to be dissapointed by not only the content, but the extent to which the producers have held back on her voice. I personally think this deviation from the style of the other albums does not do her justice, and that this album will not be remembered as one of her best. You cannot deny that she has the most magnificent of voices, such a shame it wasn't done justice by this latest release."
3,Not the GOLD fans have come to expect from Eder...,"Linda Eder has one of the most definitive and amazing voices I've heard in a long time, but this album just doesn't showcase the strength and sheer power of her voice.She moves away from the her signature big band and big, belty power ballads to a country/classic rock feel that just isn't befitting of her.Two tracks however show just what Linda is capable of. The price of the album is worth ""Gold"" and ""If I Had My Way"" alone. Lush orchestrations, amazing production, and vocal power are all showcased on these two songs."
1,wonderful voice - needs good songs,"I just love Linda's singing, but just couldn't abide the pop trash songs on this album. I think that her husband Frank Wildhorn has written some very beautiful popular music (e.g. the combination of Linda's singiing and his music in 'A New Life"" is just thrilling) but I would hurry to buy some recordings of Linda singing, for example some Cole Porter, Leonard Cohen or Rogers and Hart songs."
1,"I agree, this is a wasted effort, by Linda","It is one thing to have talent and another thing to not use this talent properly. I think Linda has one of the best talents around, but she seems to make poor decisions about things like repertoire.I know that with Linda married to Frank Wildhorn she is obligated to help his career as a songwriter, but there should be a limit to how far she will go to jeporazide her own career for the sake of his,Frank is not what I would call a super composer. He has had a few luke warm tunes, but in my opinion he will never be a significant composer like the legendary composers of Rodgers, Porter, Kern, etc.For Linda, she needes to select the best material to record., for this will be her legeacy that will remain upon her death. This is something to really think about.I can not ask anyone one to buy this subpar record."
4,Sabatier Bone knife,I just bought this knife and I love it. My husband and I like to make many boneless dishes and we use this knife all the time. The handle is very comfortable and easy to use. Your hand does not get tired when you use it.
4,Good brackets but has some looseness...,"I bought these as seperate items because they won't sell them in pairs. For the most part they were quite sturdy and well built. I used these to create a folding table in my garage and they served my needs quite well. One gripe I have was that one of the brackets has more play when set in the 90 degrees position than the other. The other one locked tight at 90 degrees. This difference is more obvious when you put weight on the edge of the table. It makes my table sink a bit when I put weight on the side where the ""problem"" bracket was installed. I looked at the mechanism and spotted a slight design difference in the two. The bracket that locked tight at 90 has an extra notch that limited the movement of the sliding mechanism; the other lacked this feature. Minus one star for this design defect from the same manufacturer. Too much troble returning and guessing which version I'll receive. I can live with this..."
4,works as described - sturdy.,The bracket work well. I only wish they did not have an intermediate stop when closing. I have no need ever to have my benchtop at a 45 degree angle.
3,"It was okay, I didn't like it that much because...","Tune In Anytime was an okay book. Personally, I didn't like it becuase it was very boring.All this girl talked about was her life, and how horrible it was. I do though think Mrs. Caroline B. Cooney is a talented writer, but I found this book not as enjoyable as some of her other titles. I didn't find the way the girl decribed her life as being horrible, it doesn't appeal as a book that would lift my or any teens spirits if they are going through what she did. I gave it three stars for her effort af trying to understand what it is like for us teens, but it wasn't the same. So please think about what I am writing before you spend $ on this title. You may like some other titles though from Mrs. Cooney, like, Flight #116 is Down! or Emergency!"
2,ive read better,"i was disapointed with this book. i LUV caroline b.cooney and most of her other books, but this one just wasnt interestin.all u read about was this girls mom who had a rock fetish and is crazy and her dad who marries a 21 yr old. wow. nothing else happens. the plot is too.... blunt. no twists and turns like her other books. i could summarize the book in a sentence. cooney writes the book in the form of a soap opera kind of, but the only difference is that soap operas are interesting--something this book is far from. if ur not gonna take my advice and not read the book, AT LEAST get it from ur library. i DO recommend cooney's other books such as the MILK CARTON series, TWINS, and 20 PAGEANTS LATER. there r more so check them out. this one just didnt cut it."
5,"ZLI says ""Get it while you have the chance""","get your money out of your wallit fast because this books worth it. I have been reading books all of my life, and I havent ever read a book quite like this one. This is a book of sarrow, comady and romance will make you feel like you want to read this book forever. GET IT NOW !!!!!!!!!"
3,OK,"I thought that the book Tune in Anytime was ok. Some of the good things about it were that the book was filled with emotion. I loved how Sophie and Marley would overreact because that's how normal people would respond with everything that was going on. It made it funny because everyone else in the book was completely calm. I also like how before each chapter Sophie would compare her life to a soap opera. I didn't like how the characters said the same things over and over. The book went really slow, even though it had a great plotline, it got boring a lot of the time. I would recommend this book, but be prepared to skip some pages because they repeat everything"
4,Caroline B Cooney at her best,"Tune in anytime by Caroline B. Cooney is my favorite book ; there are many reasons why I love this book.. for one thing it has many examples of internal and external conflict. For example the internal conflict is with Sophie, and her father (Daniel Olivetti) has just filed for divorce , and has fallen in love with his nineteen-year-old daughter's twenty-one year old roommate Persia. You can see the conflict in this story. The external conflict in this story is between Sophie and her father , and between Sophie and Persia. If you are a Caroline B. Cooney fan you will most likely love this book as much as I did. Between Marley (Sophie's sister)falling in love with a doctor, and her parents divorce, you can see this book's all action.. Caroline B. Cooney is a great author and has done a great job on this book. I hope to read more of her books . Well I'd like for you to read this book.. you don't have to but I would highly recommended it."
1,What The...??,"Was I unwell when I read it or was CBC unwell when she wrote it??That's the question..Normally a great writer,Caroline Cooney has written a strange book.All characters and their speech seemed to make no sense,were unnatural.The characters, they would come out with odd comments that sounded,as I said,unnatural and very odd.It was a very strange,weird book and I almost felt like yelling What A Stupid Book and throwing it across the room.Very peculiar it was.The story is of a teen girl whose family is in chaos,and she feels like she is in a soap opera.It seemed awful-ly written."
2,Waited & waited for the payoff...which never came!,"This book is a REAL disappointment, especially since it was written by Cooney who's usually so great at spinning out quirky, memorable, compelling characters & situations. This book - even with its framework of ""real-life soap opera"" & presence of teen angst, sibling rivalry & mental illness, stayed one-dimensional for me. I kept waiting for the characters to be fleshed out...they stayed static. The romance between Sophie & Ted never came alive; the mom's craziness was used, almost cruelly, as a point of humor. Some of the writing is light & funny & I hung in there till the end, but this book will fall off the radar screen of my memory quite soon. Her other books have stayed with me."
4,The Best of Arnaldo Vallallanes,There should of been other hits included by the other singers like Junny Ramos and Manny Manuel. The album is still worth the listen but the hits are by Arnaldo Vallallanes taking the lead vocals. He now takes the lead vocals for the renovated group Arnaldo Y La Nueva Patrulla 15. Junny Ramos sings for Kaos and Manny Manuel has a successful solo carrer as well as Joseph Fonseca.
4,I was hoping for something different,"The exercises contained in the book seem to be designed for teams that have been together for a while. Many of the exercises are designed for higher level leadership teams. Most do not translate well to short duration team building opportunities or groups that are just forming. The exercises included are well designed would probably be very helpful for the target audience, just not my audience."
4,"Great in the Department, but . . .","I've been able to implement DBDD in my department, but getting the entire organization to buy in is proving to be a greater journey. That said, my team continues to grow and exceed anyone's expectations based on the DBDD principles."
3,The Disney Way Fieldbook,"the first thought is ....WHAt is DREAM, BELIEVE, DARE, DO ?????????Where is the mouse??? Then before long it pulls you in and you are hooked!As a role playing book team approach, i think for private business the concepts are perfect for team building . need to look real close at a missing link that is EQ (Emotional Intelligence).This part will go along with the 7 habits of highly effective People and should be showcased as well.It is not a ONE item of management fits all here, rather a blend of different skill set that can be brought to the table for employers and employees to learn from and grow together while achieving a better understanding of how we can better work, live, and succeed together."
4,Great For The Boxing Fan Age 9 & Up,"Great For The Boxing Fan Age 9 & UpThis is a quick read and a short book - probably take you an hour - tops - it's only 48 pages.Ron Knapp takes a few pages per boxer to give you a very brief outline of the boxer and his career.Great for the boy or girl (or even adult) just getting interested in boxing - gives you a very rough draft of 10 of the greatest boxers - and I think can serve as an inspiration on who to learn more about.Not necessarily for the boxing fan that's been a student and/or a fan of the sweet science, although it would make a funny gift for them - hey - it's got 10 pictures.This is really a great book for - and geared toward the pre teen (or even teen) interested in boxing and/or boxers - the book say ages 9 and up - and depending on the reader could go younger and older."
4,Everything I needed...,This book provided me with all the information I needed for my graduate level sport management class.
2,Too shallow,"I bought the book as supporting material for a masters degree course I teach called ""Quality management in the Business of Sports"". The phrase Quality Management was clearly defined in the key-word list the authors presented. My dissapointment came when I saw that the book is mostly a general primer covering many aspects of the business of sports, but none in depth and specially nothing specific about quality management."
1,CAREFUL! The DVD is missing sketches that were on the original VHS version!,"First off, I love Eddie Murphy. In my opinion, he's one of the more brilliant talents to come out of SNL. But it's a crying shame that sketches that were included on the original VHS version of ""Eddie Murphy: Best of SNL"" have been deleted from the DVD version. My particular favorite piece (Eddie playing a rastafarian singing ""we're gonna kill da white people"" at a meeting of mostly white VFW members) is NOT on this DVD along with a number of others. Have the SNL folks suddenly become squeamish and politically correct - I can only assume that such cowardice and overly correct behavior is at the root of such an obvious ommission. After having owned the VHS version, I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the DVD. I would return it if I could. Listen to the other viewers and don't be fooled."
1,Rip Off,"Like many of the other reviewers I feel cheated. Anything contoversial was left out. As a dumb suburban honkey myself, I demand the reissue of this dvd with ""Kill the White People"". What good are all those funny sketches if SNL doesn't have the balls to put them on dvd?I also didn't read any reviews as I assumed I was getting the same product that was put on vhs years ago. Instead I got scammed. What's even worse is the ""bonus scene"" is the Opie Cunningham interview which was already on the original vhs. Please explain how this is a bonus.I was furious when the movie ended. The least they can do is put out a part 2. I thought I was buying the Cadillac of comedy. Instead I got the Ford Pinto of crap."
2,terrible,"The beginning of the tape was fine, midway through, it started to stall and then not play anything all. I never even saw the end of the tape as it would not pLAY."
5,Best of Saturday Night Live VHS Update,"I want to update everyone. I just purchased Eddie Murphy Best of Saturday Night Live. Since I saw bad reviews about this one, I just ordered the VHS. Guess what, they not only sent the VHS but also included a DVD. So I was able to get all of the skits that reviewers complained this DVD does not have. I ordered it from Amazon and I selected the VHS from Miss Marybooks. I did not purchase the $95 one but the used VHS for $13 but as I said I got a free DVD. This is a great buy and the skits are hilarious.PS-I am only rating this DVD because I cannot submit the comment without it, but just wanted to let everyone know if you want to get the other as a DVD, order the VHS (I will always give Eddie 5 stars). See the vendor above."
1,Not what I expected.,The DVD blacked out and some of the scenes I rememberd from watching it previously were deleted.
2,not as good as the ORIGINAL,"I had this video about 5 years ago, i loved and lost it. when i ordered this video i was under the impression it was the same one, but it was lacking many sketches such as the galactic prfalactic, and some of the Mr robinsons neighborhooh sketches like the black market baby. i am totally unimpressed with this video b/c i knew what to expect prior to ordering it, if you dont, youll get a good laugh, because it is hilarious"
1,RIPPED OFF!,"I gave this DVD 4 stars the first time it was released and 1 star the second time. I bought it the first time it was released. When I saw the different cover and the words ""bonus editon"", I assummed it contained the missing episodes fans were requesting that weren't on the first DVD. Wrong. There were too many great episodes missing: ""Guy Talk"" with Michael Jackson, ""Ronald Reagon is My Father"", ""Cotton Land"", ""Tyrone & His Reggae Band"" and more. Thank goodness I rented this one first, but I still feel cheated. What do fans have to do to get what they want?"
1,Also Feel Ripped Off,"Admittedly, I did not buy this DVD through Amazon but when I saw how high of a rating this had, I had to submit a review. I bought the DVD specifically just for the ""galactic prophylactic"" bit that was on the original VHS Tape and it is not on the DVD. Was what is on the DVD funny? Yes. But as others have also pointed out it is missing some of the funniest moments that were on the original VHS version. I can only hope that one day Lorne will come to his senses and release the full version of SNL The best of Eddie Murphy on DVD."
2,OLD BUT NOT EXACTLY GOOD STUFF,"It was okay, but the clips from the 80's weren't all that good, maybe over the years; my perception on funny stuff has changed."
3,How About A 'Best Of' SNL By Year?,"How about making 'Best Of' Saturday Night Live by year? Not by host, not something with interviews and commentary, just best skits only and by year. Best of 1978, Best Of 1986, Best Of 1994, etc..."
2,"A disappointment, for sure","This was not very funny. It lacked a lot of the subtle intellectual nuances that comedy usually brings. I found it very dated and dull. There were some skits that were mildly amusing, but not funny. I wish I had never made this purchase."
2,Not as funny as I remembered,"When I saw this DVD- I just had to get it, because my husband and I remembered how hilarious that one sketch was - the one where he pretends to be a white man. But after seeing it again after all these years, I must say that our society has ""outgrown"" its humor. It just isn't as funny because we've all grown to accept much edgier comedy, with the likes of Dave Chapelle, Carlos Mencia, etc. It still was amusing and brought back good memories from back in the day, but it just wasn't as hilariously shocking as it once was."
4,Eddie Murphy Best of Saturday Night Live,The tape is in very good shape. The shipping took a little longer than stated.
2,"IMSI Masterclips 1,000,001 doesn't deliver all it advertises","IMSI Masterclips 1,000,001 doesn't exactly deliver what it promises. The only way to get the advertised photographs and fonts is to download them from their website....HOWEVER, you can only do so free for ONE YEAR (the box doesn't tell you this). While this product thankfully does include a catalog (black and white, even though the box's inside flap shows that it is in color), not all images that appear in the catalog can actually be found on the 32 CDs that come inside the box. Sporadically and what appears to be randomly, items that appear in the printed catalog cannot be found on any of the 32 CDs. Disappointing."
5,I love this book,Just enough information to get you started growing plants from plants (as opposed to buying starts and seeds) Also contains good guidance on plant rescuing (Transplanting)
3,outstanding,"This book is excellent helped me to understand more about the parables, and how they relate to life."
4,Excellent but too short!,I came upon this book at my local library so I had nothing to lose by reading it. I had read the reviews and saw they were mixed. I am now a new Linda Howard fan. This book was a definie page turner and you were kept guessing about the actual contents of the notebook. I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. It was a little too short though. I would love to see Marc and Karen's story continue.
3,Not one of Linda Howard's best,Kill and Tell had two problems- the suspense and the romance. The suspense wasn't that surprising. I figured out why her father was killed early on. It was too obvious. The romance had even more problems. All I saw was lust. The characters did not have enough time in the book to fall in love. Linda Howard started out doing something I don't see often enough in romance. She had the hero where a condom. Then later in the book they decide they don't need protection. After knowing each other a few days I'm led to believe they know and love each other enough to make a baby. Give me a break! What really bothers me is that Linda Howard showed in Son of the Morning that she has great potential as a writer. That book was a very good suspense novel with interesting characters. I hope I see Linda Howard live up to that potential again.
3,"Not her best, but still a Linda Howard","One of my favourit things about Linda Howard's books is that she nearly always has an epilogue. I think closure is important and leaves the reader with a happy satisfied feeling. This book is too short and did not have enought time to develop its characters. I think Marc and Karen had a lot of potential that was not used. Because of this, the book desperately needed closure. I hope we can see Linda Howard at her best soon."
4,GOOD ENOUGH!,I ENJOYED IT! IT WAS NOT MY FAVORITE OF HER BOOKS BUT YOU CAN'T HELP LIKING HER CHARACTERS - ESPECIALLY THE MEN!!
2,Definetly not good!,"After reading ""After the Night"", ""Dream Man"" and even ""Angel Creek"", I was waiting this book to be a success. But the subject is only about the suspense. Not much about the couple. As one of the reviewers said below, John Medina's story looks like more promising than this one."
3,A lukewarm read. Ms. Howard can and has done better.,"I've been enjoying Ms. Howard's work for years, but Kill And Tell left me cold. There was nothing wrong with it, but there wasn't anything compelling either. Not every book an authors writes is great, nor does every reader respond the same way. Maybe her next will be better."
2,Where's the plot?,"In this book you'll read about a love story. Pathetic but at least a love story. You'll read about New Orleans, a nurses's life, a hit man that blunders once and again. But what about the main plot? Why everybody was interested in Karen's life? Why, you'd read about that at the last 50 pages or so. So if you only read the last pages you'll save a lot of time.I think LH can write better than this."
1,Ah--my mistake,"I must not have read a Linda Howard before--I despise it when suspense books or thrillers ""chick out"" and the sap and sappiness starts to rise--as it did in this one when the plucky nurse lays eyes on the honey-voiced cop. Ba--arf! Then I read here that the romance was spoiled by the CIA aspect--the oppposite of what I hated. Sorry. Will not gravitate to this author again... Different strokes...er...opinions..."
2,Sorry Linda - this one fell short...,"No offense to Ms Howard but boy was this a rough book to get through. I never leave reviews because I'm not as eloquent with my writing as other reviewers but I do read a lot (and I mean A LOT) and I enjoy books that have good suspense, love interests work too, and throw in some sick killings and I'm a happy camper. This book however could have been cut in half. There was so much extraneous information in it that I found myself tabbing through page after page trying to get back to the actual story - which in the long run wasn't worth it. 8 bucks isn't bad but I've read quite a few ebooks for $3 that were worth 5 stars. Sorry Linda, better luck next time."
3,Good storyline,I enjoyed the plot and the characters of this book. The heroine was very likable and not the usual to innocent dummy and the man well he was typical Howard but the heroine made up for that so worth a read.
2,Pretty disappointing!,After reading her other books I guess I expected more and I was very disappointed. The characters were never fully developed and she focused on the supporting characters way too much. I read the reviews before I purchased the book but next I will pay more attention.
4,Captivating,"I truly enjoyed this book, full of action, suspense, and romance. The characters are believable and I loved the development of their relationship. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend, and would even read it again. I've become a fan of this author and try and snatch up each new book once available.Read it, you won't be sorry you did. She's an amazing author."
4,GREAT ONE,"I love it. I finished reading it in just 4 hours. I can't stop myself. Readers beware, this book will make you unable to stop. I love the main characters. Marc and Karen were great couple. But you know what, I kinda like John Medina's character too. He's so cool!! I wish Ms. Howard will write a special book about him."
4,A good read,"Okay, the only reason that this book did not get 5 stars was because it did not have a shocking ending. Other than that, it was very good. The suspense did pull you along fairly well. The relationship did seem to move rather abruptly but it was a romantic suspense novel so you kind of expect it. I read it in less than a day and so it must have kept me interested enough to not put it down. I would say all in all it is a good read. I like the John Medina stories the author does and he makes a cameo appearance in this story."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I don't understand why anyone would give this book less than 5 stars. It was excellent! Karen goes to New Orleans to identify her estranged father. The detective in charge, Marc is no nonsense man who cares about his cases. The attraction is mutual from the beginning and it got only better. It was refreshing to read about two people who realize early on how they feel about each other instead of the always 'he/she loves me, he/she doesn't' That thinking is getting quite old with some authors. Linda Howard is by far my favorite and I have loved them all.... with the exception of Sarah's Child because the female lead character was too much of a wimp. I wholeheartedly agree with the reader from California... good work Linda!"
5,Great book,"I have only recently been reading Linda Howard books and I am a fan. I have decided she is going on my favorite list along side Nora Roberts, Jayne Ann Krantz, Dara Joy, Donna Fletcher, Lynn Kurland to name a few. She is in great company. Her characters are strong, funny, and she writes a great story. Some people seem to have a problem with the fact some of her characters get together too quickly. People its a story, not real life. its for enjoyment. I have read other books of hers. I like the paranormal stuff as well as her sense of humor. You Go Girl. You have a new and devoted fan."
4,Great read,"This book catches your attention right away. Found it hard to put down and one that I could read again. Linda Howard brings people together who, in the usual course of events, would never meet. How they work out their differences and come together to solve challenges keeps you turning pages."
4,Kill & Tell,Just for readers information-John Medina was the hero in All The Queens's Menone of my favorite books! LH is one of my favorite writers!
2,Not very good,Too many characters for such a quick read. Story moved too fast for the characters to be developed. Sex scene was spectacular but I couldn't picture Karen even at the end. Not the usual Linda Howard we've come to expect but don't give up on her because her other works are spectacular. I just read Perfect by Judith Mcnaught prior to this and may have a lot to do w/ my review since Perfect is a 10 star book.
5,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,"I read the first half of this book in one day and I probably could have read the whole thing if it hadn't been for ""other obligations"" that literally FORCED me to put the book down! As a matter of fact, after I finished the book, I couldn't keep myself from going back and reading selected parts of it again! I just couldn't get enough of Marc and Karen. Wish there was a sequel! Excellent story, I would highly recommend it to anyone."
2,author is capable of much better than this,"I have read a number of Linda Howard books and waited impatiently for the publication of this one. What a disappointment! The characters and plot were very underdeveloped and the book, in general, was boring. Linda Howard is an excellent author and is capable of much better works than this book. Linda, please write us a worthy successor to ""Son of the Morning"" and ""Dream Man""!!"
4,Disappointed that it ended so soon,"This was a decent book, Linda Howard had me guessing about what vital information was in the notebook. She didn't give anything away. She did a great job developing Marc Chastain, I felt like I knew him and understood the character, but felt that Karen Whitlaw wasn't as well developed. I think she needed more of a personality. Something was missing. Other than that, this book was a great read and I would recommend it."
5,The Best yet by Ms. Howard,"I loved this book. I have already re-read it many times. The story was great and the characters were terrific. Marc was so smooth you had to forgive him and all his practiced moves. Karen was intellegent enough to see the facts and get out of the way.It was a quick read and I couldnt put it down. The thing that I now wish for is a story about John Medina, it would go along great with the cloak-in-dagger stuff that Ms. Howard does sooo well. All around terrific..."
5,Steamy!!,"I've been hooked on Linda Howard books since reading ""Mr. Perfect"", and this is one of her best! I would describe this as more of a romance book than a mystery/suspense though. While parts were suspenseful, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen in the end. I did love both the settings of New Orleans and Columbus though. I was in Columbus over the summer and who hasn't dreamed of visiting New Orleans at one time? The best part of this book though, shamefully, is the passionate sex! Oh my...I actually blushed while reading this book. You won't be disappointed if you read this great Linda Howard book!"
2,Howard's Kill and Tell--Why?,"I purchased Kill and Tell on the strength of Ms. Howard's name alone. I didn't even read the blurb on the back.Kill and Tell felt incomplete. Why did the two main characters fall in love? More to the point how did the these two fall in love? He hated her on principal, and she knew he disliked her. Yet he wanted her and she fell in line, (or in bed, as the case maybe).I've read several of Ms. Howard's books, like ""Touch of Fire"", ""Heart of Fire"", ""White Lies"" and many others. This book was beneath her great talent.I'm more curious about John Medina that I am about Karen and Marc. I can only hope Medina's story is much better.Long time Romance Reader"
5,Thumbs up!,"This book has both an interesting plot and believable and likeable characters. Karen Whitlaw and New Orleans detective Marc Chastain play off of each other beautifully throughout this well crafted novel. Karen must travel to New Orleans to identify her father, the victim of a homocide. Why would someone murder an apparently homeless man? That's for Karen and Marc to discover, and the secret soon leads to attempts on Karen's life. I fell in love with Marc -- he's tough, charming, handsome, knows how to dress, and owns a home in the French Quarter. It doesn't get much better than that! Linda Howard delivers, as usual, a keeper."
4,Good read...,"Howard is great at making the reader relate to and care about her characters, as well as developing the relationship between her hero and heroine at a realistic pace (with tension and steaminess spurring them on). The plot for the one was good, but lagged a little in spots. Not enough to make me put it down, though! Looking forward to reading the next one on her backlist. :)"
3,Not up to her usual standard,"Linda Howard rarely dissapoints but this book was definately the exception to the rule. Don't get me wrong, the story itself was quite good and it wasn't sluggish to read but the spark just wasn't there. I think the reason this book has received such mixed reviews is because we all expect such a high standard out of this author. This book is well worth reading still and if you don't expect too much out of it you should have a pleasant if not overly stimulating read."
1,The wrong c.d.,"Hey amazon.com. This is not the right c.d. I mean the cover to this c.d. is right but the tracks are not the same. The tracks that are displayed here are from one of ""la banda gorda's"" compilation c.d.'s"
2,A vividly descriptive book; but lacking a true journey.,"This book certainly reveals certain aspects of the small town south; but as descriptive and true as it may be, it is not a quality book. The character does not really evolve toward any end; she changes, but almost randomly. There is no thread connecting from page to page to chapter. The end (or lack thereof) is the worst part. There is not tying of loose ends, no final conclusion, no looking back. The book just cuts off.It utilizes excellent language to tell a poor story, and in the end, while Maya might know, the reader has no idea why the caged bird sings.-s1desh0w"
2,Quality Control Issues,"Great knives except for one thing, 2 of the steak knives started to rust. The areas were small but I expect no issues for a knife set that costs this much. I never put these into a dishwasher. They were always hand washed.It looked like there was some contamination on the forging dies when these knives were manufactured. There were small inclusions in the steel where the rust was noticed. Getting a new set soon. If I have the same issue I will be returning for a refund.Update 12-04-12Reveived the new set and so far no issues. I've updated to 4 stars.Update 01-07-13These knives rust if any water is left on them. I have to hand wash and immediately dry to keep them in good condition. I can't return them as it's too late. Save your money and purchase another brand."
5,Great knives,These knives are great. Sharpest knives I have ever used. They cost less than its comparables and work perfectly. I see myself using these knoves for the rest of my life.
3,No place on the block for the kitchen fork??!,"Got my knife set last night and I was very disappointed to find out that there's no spot on the knife block for the kitchen fork! Called customer service thinking they might have given me a wrong size block and I was told that that's just the way it is. I could use the slot for the kitchen shears for the kitchen fork, but I can't fit both items on the block. Are you kidding me? Considering the price I paid for this set, I expected a better answer than that. I probably would still keep it for the quality of the knives, but man, that empty slot is going to bug the heck out of me!"
5,Childhood re-visited,"I loved this book as a child, and loved reading it to my grand-daughter-even when she chose it four nights in a row. Somehow it invokes a joy for the sound of the words and the simple but lovely pictures,along with the satisfaction of mixing colors and discovering how they magically change into a new color."
5,A Must-Have,All beginning ophthalmology residents should have this book. It makes the first night on call much easier. Great quick reference.
5,Saxon math meeting book 2,"A great place for learning calender, weather, temperature, graphing, number charts, etc. An essential part of the Saxon 2 curriculum."
1,Be careful... Not listed properly,"This title sounds as if you are getting the entire Saxon Math book for Grade 2.Instead when we purchased it, and waited almost 2 weeks for it to arrive (Even with Prime) and what came were just a thin book that had Math calendars and worksheets.these were items that are not needed but EXTRA items.As well, these were all items that we could have used already owned items for.Hope you read the review before purchasing!"
2,Not worth the $$,"I'm sure this will be an excellent help to the program, but I can't believe I paid $12 for this. It's worth maybe 3-5. It's just a few flimsy sheets of paper (very few) with some calendars and graphs. Would be very easy to make in any word processing program. Get it as cheap as you can if you have to have it!"
1,Pass the ABSITE- Pass this book up,"There are several other publications out there that will serve you better than this one. The Rush Review is a good comprehensive review, maybe a bit tougher that the ABSITE questions. Basic Science for Surgeons is very relevant if it doesn't put you to sleep. The Michigan Review obtained through the University of Michigan Website is fantastic, but expensive. The ABSITE Killer is the best and cheapest book I have found. Not a complete study guide, but a good focused reference source. Unfortunately your program might have to do some research to order these booklets, the cost is between $12 to $15, try noelle@peoplespc.com"
3,Absite Killer,"I used this book for the Absite during my general surgery internship, but I found Absite killer to be more helpful. Absite killer is available for your PDA at absitekiller.com. I am not a general surgery resident, I just did my internship in general surgery to prepare me for ophthalmology residency. Absite killer is more suited for non-categoricals or if your time is limited. You will score at least the mean."
2,Decent Intern Book,"This book is best suited for the harried intern. The questions highlight some important topics, but this book, at best, should serve as a minor adjunct to your reading regimen.Although this is book is sold as a ""pocket"" type book that fits easily in your white coat, I found the book to be too heavy and cumbersome. A PDA version would be a huge improvement."
5,Nice adjunct,This is a great book to carry with you and couple of question showed up on exam (in a slightly different wording)
4,10 Round Nonstick Tube Pan,I have really enjoyed my tube pan. I have baked at least 10 cakes since I received my product. The clean up is so easy. I am able to wipe my pan out with a wet paper towel and then just wash in warm soapy water. I am very pleased with my purchase.
3,Non-stick? not so much! :-/,"Very sturdy material, but my experience has been that the pan requires so much ""prep"" that it might as well be called ""semi non-stick"". I've stopped using this pan in favor of lighter and less expensive pans which use the same amount of non-stick preparation.I really wish that there was a non-stick grading system for cook/bake ware, since all are obviously not equal."
3,I am not sure why....,"But I just don't find Trudeau's later work nearly as engaging, clever or funny as the earlier work. This is not the worst, but not the best either."
4,paricon Canadian Toboggan,"We sent the six foot Paricon Canadian Toboggan to our family in Virginia. Itarrived quickly and in good shape and they love it. They seemed to be very pleased with it. Coincidentially, we received a tobaggan (from another manufacturer) from them the same day. Neither one of of knew the other one wasthinking about getting the other one a tobaggan !"
2,Didn't Fit,"This is supposed to be compatible with socket 775 processors, but I could't find a way to attach it to the Abit IP35Pro motherboard. It was easy to return for credit."
5,A True Crime Masterpiece!,Man Overboard: The Counterfeit Ressurection of Phil Champagne is one of the best written true crime books out there. I would recommend it to anyone who is craving a good story with lots of twists and turns. From the first page Burl Barer has you hooked. A must read for any true crime fan. RECOMMENDED!
5,The first book I would recommend,"I have read four books on sports psychology and this is the best. My favorite book on the topic is still Mind Gym but if I had to recommend one psychology book that somebody could begin applying the next day it would be With Winning in Mind. This book is very short. Every idea and step of the system has profound importance. The author, an Olympic champion, knows how to win and he has presented a straightforward system for others who want to be winners."
1,With Winning in Mind,"This book, if you follow the author's directions, will help you improve performance in almost anything you choose. It helped me to improve my archery scores by at least 20%. A must read for anyone who wants or needs to improve performance in competition, business or just about any part of your life."
4,Concise and Effective,"A quick read that gets to the point and is not burdened by theory. Applicable to all walks of life, however most examples in the book are from competitive shooting and golf, though by following the steps, one can apply these great mental exercises and tricks to one's current situation."
5,Critical knowledge for achieving the next level.,"A must read for anyone who needs to gain the edge to reach their dreams.Most of the other reviews already cover everything I'd like to say about this book.It was worth a read, and the ideas in it can be applied to anything you can imagine."
5,Awesome Book!,This book changed my attitudes and increased my tournament performance. Just an awesome book!
5,The best $12.00 I've spent this year!,"I like the straight forwardness and simplicity of this book. Being a shooter I definitely related to his examples, but I can easily see this books applications to all other aspects of my life. Using the techniques from this book I have seen great results as well as improved proccess in my sport. I highly reccomend it!"
5,a super gun for anyone,"This gun is just amazing you can't imagine it. When I first saw the walther nighthawk at sports authority I thought it was some sort of extreme James Bond gun. When I went home I looked it up on the internet and saw the Beretta, right away I ordered it. you are going to love this gun with its four picatinny rails for additional accesories. This gun would be perfect to keep out raccoons and possums at night because, of the red-dot sight, and the flashlight. You don't even have to think about it you need to get this gun TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Great fun, great learning, easy to read and work with.","At first I was pretty skeptical about using a book like this to help me along in my growth as a writer, but after the first two parts I have to say it's been pretty good. The samples are very well handled and the intent is solidly established by the authors. Definitely worth buying and keeping at your side if you should need a writing nudge!"
3,Teaching exercises without a teacher to teach them,"Someone recommended this book as the best book she'd ever encountered. It is quite possibly the best collection of ""creative writing"" exercises I've ever encountered. Perfect for a class or workshop. Not much use without a teacher or workshop presenter. An example would be the eternal question, and one that's asked on page 51. ""What does your character want?"" And the answer. ""If you don't know you don't know your character as well as you should.""Which is a ""duh"" moment, but should also be an opportunity for explanation. ""How do you find out? And what is pertinent?"" But instead, is simply the end of the exercise. This book would have been a hundred times better with fewer exercises and more follow-through."
4,Creative Writing Text,"The book was purchased as a text for a creative writing class. It contains numerous writing exercises, is well thought out and effective."
3,"Fair quality, good price.","Not fantastic, but not bad. You get what you pay for and this was pretty cheap."
4,Decent quality at a low price,"For the price, this is a great towel. Only wish that it included a plastic fastener as opposed to the metal one. Everything else about this towel is great."
2,ehh...,"Was kind of disappointed after paying $15 for this thing when I found out that they sell them at the DOLLAR STORE. I would have been much happier with the results if I only paid $1 for it. It works ok... but if you decide to purchase it, get it from the dollar store, if you don't like it throw it out."
1,"In the dictionary under uncomfortable, I actually found this picture","I'm a tall guy, 6'8"", and so finding a chair that actually provides some lumbar support is nigh impossible. I saw this actually on an article on lifehacker, and decided to take a chance on it. I had it on my chair for a total of 15 minutes,fiddling with it the whole time trying to find a sweet spot, and then I took it off and put it in the closet, where its been for the past 3 weeks.For forcing improved posture, it's probably pretty good. For comfort? Just invest in a new chair, as this shortcut will only lead to disappointment."
1,I must be missing something,"I always buy my products based on people's reviews. Surprised to see how many people like this product. It really doesn't do anything for me...not in the slightest. If you want to try one out, I hear Walgreens has one that is very inexpensive. I have not tried this on my car seat, so maybe there is still hope, but it just is still too far back and gives too much to anything that the back of your chair wouldn't do."
4,great support but not universal fit,My coworkers and I love the back support but it does move around. I guess this can be an advantage for all the body types that are using it at work.
3,Not Bad - But not the prefect solution,"The only prob is it keeps sliding, so it has to be adjusted every now and then"
3,Posture Chair Lumbar Support,"Good idea, but could be firmer, gives a bit too much to be of really good support. But does help somewhat. I guess that if it was more supportive, if would cost more! But would be better. Not bad for the price!"
5,Feeling better already,"I noticed an immediate improvement in the pain in my lower back after purchasing this product. The price is great, it is professional looking and most importantly, very supportive. I recommend it."
2,Not reliable,It is a low quality product. At the first week the rubber that holds it to the back of the chair got so loose I had to tie it with another string.It is totally useless now. I need to replace with a better quality support.
4,A giant of a lumbar support,"This lumbar support is comfortable on my office chair, however in my car it proved to be way to big. I am 6'6"" and I find this support quite large, so be understanding of the dimensions before ordering."
5,It's not metal!,"So I bought this thinking it was metal, because that's what it looked like in the pictures. It is not metal. And OMG is it comfortable. You can adjust it to be higher or lower on the back of your chair depending on where your pain is. I didn't want to get up after using this. My mom also enjoys using it - pain free sitting!EDIT: 03/31/2012I have bought 4 of these - these are amazing, and really help my back feel better. I keep mine in my car at all times. I bought a 5th one, and to save some money, did not buy it from Amazon, but instead a third-party seller here on Amazon, same product. Well, it turned out to be NOT the same product, not even by Angel Sales. It seemed to be a $2 product from the dollar store. Returned it, bought the same item sold from Amazon - MUCH better, and is the original Angel Sales PosturePro. Be aware of the seller you buy this from! Spend the extra $5 and get it from Amazon."
1,Cheap Construction,"The first time I put it on a chair, the elastic band that secures it to the chair completely ripped off of one side! Hopefully I can repair it without compromising the mesh where it attaches to the edge in that spot."
5,Made my chair so much better,This has made my old wooden chair significantly more comfortable. Highly recommended for this absurdly low price.The biggest negative is the strap that attaches to the chair is a bit loose and not the best quality. But that's what you should expect for a product at this price point. It's definitely worth the money and a great value.
1,Poor quality and very little help for my aching back,"A lot of people have given this item favorable reviews, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve it. The item does provide a little extra support, but it's just a little. The main problem is that it's cheaply made and won't last. There are better solutions out there."
2,Never came,"Strange, I just never got it, but I wonder if it works well, and if it is designed for all types of office chairs?"
2,you get what you pay for...,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and I thought it would be good for my office chair. The only thing is, it did not fit my chair. The strap that they show in the picture that goes around the back does not have enough elastic in it to stay around the chair. Therefore, it keeps slipping down. So all day, I am constantly trying to fix it to make it stay in place.If it had stayed in place it would have been good."
3,Lumbar Support,"The support product works very well for me and relieves the pressure on my lower back when I am seated. I work from home and sit at a computer most of the day, so it was a welcome relief. There is one thing, though, that I found to be a bit of a nusiance. I sit in an office type chair where there is separation of the back and the seat of the chair (as one can see from the picture). This space between the seat and back causes the bottom of Posture Pro support to slide through thus taking away from the overall effectiveness. I have to continually move the product up and out of this space to get the full benefit of using it. Otherwise, after each adjustment, it works well."
3,alright,"For the money that I paid for it, I think it worked for me. Though it wasn't something very comfortable, but I guess if you need something better, you should buy a better chair."
1,Flimsy support,The mesh provides very little resistance. I have to stuff a pillow into the thing to feel it at all. I am currently shopping for something more substantial for my office chair.
3,Beware of Dollar Tree Lumbar Support,"Please don't think that the lumbar support sold at Dollar Tree is the same product as the one featured here. It's pure junk (not even worth a dollar) & provides no support at all. The frame of the Posture Pro, though not of stellar quality, is sufficiently sturdy to give firm support. Its longevity may be questionable, but it's a much better choice than the Dollar Tree product. A friend purchased a very high quality mesh back support (made in the USA) at a quilting convention for $20. It's construction is even better than the Posture Pro, but I haven't seen anything like it for sale online."
5,I like it,"I bought this as a gift for my co-worker. She is very satisfied about this product. It really helps for daily office people. Supporting back and make you feels more comfortable. Also, the price is very good."
4,Great Product Great Price,Delivered fast. Fits any chair great. Made my lower back feel great. Great price. I really need more support for my upper back and lower back at same time.
3,just OK,"It doesn't make a difference in my chair's comfort, or my back pain.Maybe I just have a bad chair."
1,You get what you pay for,"I had to put a knot in the elastic band to tighten up the support on the chair. It still keeps slipping down. I am not sure if it works, but I am not sending it back, it may cost as much as I paid for it to do so."
3,Lumbar support cushion,"I bought the Posture Pro Lumbar Support for use in a desk chair that has too deep a seat for me. It is made of lightweight, cool mesh. Its only drawback is that I also wanted it to use in my car, and I'm not sure how easily it will fit there. (I haven't tried it for that, yet.) I am pleased with this product."
5,Better than expected for the price,"We didn't expect this product to perform as well as it is, considering the low price. My driver's seat has always been uncomfortable. My husband's truck is the same way. We added one of these supports to each car's driver and passenger seats and now long trips are way more comfortable. Great find!"
1,Totally useless,"This has to be one worst back-support products out there. First of all, it constantly slips of position. I spent more time putting it back into place than I did resting on it. And, the mesh starts to sag and lose it's support after time -- you wind-up looking silly, sitting back on a ergo-shape wire. The up side is that I bought it and a discount, so I don't feel so bad that I had to trash it after a year. Still looking for a better back support for work, any suggestions?"
3,It's OK,"If your chair is not one solid piece, this slips down and loses its support. I don't see how it works on the chair pictured because it would slide down and it would stick through the bottom space of the chair. Otherwise I think it would work OK. I do like the mesh design."
3,Inexpensive lumbar support,"This seems to help a bit with my uncomfortable car seats, but I still get a sore lower back--it might work better with office chairs."
2,"Poorly made, mediocre support","I bought this because it seemed easy to carry around (from home to work) and inexpensive. It has been amply reviewed, for the most part positively, so I thought I would give it a try. Well, I don't get it. This is very cheaply made, is over priced and only provides mediocre support at best. I cannot imagine that it will last for more than a few months. Only one piece of wire provides all of the support. It flexes easily, both in and out and side to side. I am returning it."
2,Nice idea but doesn't fit right,It's a great idea but doesn't fit me right. Maybe its because I'm petite but the curve is not the right shape. It also has only 1 strap and doesn't stay put.
2,Angel Sales PosturePro Lumbar Support,"This fits comfortably behind by back in our auto; however, it broke on our first extended trip and now can't remove it (broken piece stuck below seat). It is really not sturdy enough for use by a large man such as myself. Look for better one is my suggestion if you are going to use with a car seat. Might be find for a desk chair."
1,The elastic band ripped the 1st day,"After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. First, I did not even get a chance to try it out well because the elastic band ripped! After I'll fix it I will give it a second try!"
1,A new torture device,"I purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem. Big mistake! It simply will not stay put no matter what chair I tried it with. The arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much, it has you bending over backwards. I believe it actually made my back ache more."
4,great concept,"If it fits your chair, and lumber support is your problem, this is a great product. Well designed and doesn't cause a sweaty back. Keep in mind you will still have to be conscious of your posture, as this only helps, it doesn't 100% correct it for you, but it is a really GOOD help. I wouldn't recommend changing it from chair to chair often, as the elastic may start to wear out, but I haven't taken it off for a year and it's been perfectly fine. Minus one star only b/c, despite the fact that Amazon is almost ALWAYS better priced than any storefront, I found this product about 1/3 the price being asked here, however, it's still definitely worth the price being asked here - less than 20 bucks to help your posture and take care of your body."
2,Not sturdy enough,It really doesn't seem to do much. It's not strong enough to influence any change in posture or provide support - it simply gives way until your back is touching the chair-back. And I'm a slender guy.
3,Bleh.,I guess it's okay. It does its function. It's hard to keep on the chair but I guess it depends on the size of your chair. After about a month the stretch part that holds it in place gets over-stretched and becomes loose. Occasionally detaches from the chair.
4,Excellent for those with lower back problems due to slouching.,"I bought this when I kept throwing out my lower back, which I attributed to slouching in my office chair all day. Since buying this, I haven't had any major back issues.It doesn't completely prevent me from slouching, as I still catch myself doing it, but it makes it much more comfortable to sit up straight."
1,pretty much useless in my instance,"I don't get the good reviews for this. I have an office chair that looks similar to the one in the picture, and the thing just slips down.Maybe with a closed bottomed chair (no gap between seat and back) it would work. Not my situation and not what the photo suggests. I suspected it wouldn't work for me, but got it anyway.Useless. Tossed immediately. I did get another product recently, and I'll post a review after I've given it some use.Might just have to splurge on one of those ridiculously expensive chairs."
3,Pretty good for the price,"It's a pretty cheap solution, but it does the job for me. It gives me a lot more support, and it serves it's purpose. I look forward to a more elegant solution next time, but if you want a reliable back support for a good price, look no further."
3,disappointed,I loved how it worked behind my back but the strap broke when I put it on my chair. I bought another and the same thing happened other than that I would have given it five stars
3,helps,"Overall it helps, but it's not as good as my co-workers for some reason. for 2 bucks you can't go wrong though."
3,"Not super sturdy, but useful","I've got these in the car and in several office chairs. They work, but are prone to getting torn up."
2,Bought this for work.,"I bought this item for work because not sitting up properly was causing side pains. I never had a problem with the mesh support, seeing as how it was there more as a reminder to sit up straight as opposed to something I would actually lean against. My problem was that with a standard office chair (like the one shown in the picture) the product would slide down and fall into the space between the back rest and the seat. And, once the elastic gets stretched out (which happens fairly soon) it makes the product virtually useless."
2,Didn't stay in place,"Didn't work to be secured in place on a chair back. It would fit a very specific type of old school office chair as pictured, but not any type of newer chair with a broader back, and even the older ones it seems like it would still be subject to moving around. Returned it the same day I opened it, which was disappointing because I really needed this!"
2,Posture pro,"I was disappointed. I don't know if these are made consistently. I got one because my friend had one, and her's is much more sturdy and effective. Mine does not hold its shape and therefore, does not provide the support that it claims to support. I think that it is a defective one? More quality control should be given before I would recommend this product to someone else."
3,It is OK though not great,Thought this would be a firm support for my back but I am wrong. The mesh is kinda too soft for support. I am actually quite thin (5.5' and 105 lb) but my back still sinks into it. And the packaging is terrible (almost broken) when it arrived.
3,decent for the money,This item is decent for the money you pay for it. I do have to keep pulling it up on the chair though because there is nothing that keeps it up if you dont have a lip on the back of your chair. Other than that it does the job.
2,Junk,"I ordered this on December 10, 2010. It broke around January 17, 2011. The metal frame that gives the thing its shape snapped in two right in the center of the lower edge, where it rests against the chair.I give it two stars because while it lasted, it provided ok back support."
2,Doesn't stay in place,I use this on my home office chair and i have a very difficult time keeping it in place. A carefully placed safety pin worked but i would have liked it to have some sort of tightening mechanism built in. Velcro or a latch would be enough.
1,just doesn't work any good,"I've tried to get this support to work on my office chair, and I could not. If I put it higher on the seat back, the support is too high and wrong-shaped. If I put it lower, it slides off the bottom of the seat back (and always tries to move lower by itself). Well, I kind of found the solution for that: stuffed a towel between the seat and the seat back, so that the bottom of the support frame sits on the towel and can't slide away. Good location, sort of decent lumbar support, but another problem surfaced up: the top of the frame gets in the way and hurts my spine. Plus the support itself is not so great, the mesh is too soft. So I've tried it every which way and can't get it to work. It's useless."
3,It's ok.,"I have to sit really tight on the back for the lumbar support to stay in the middle of my back, otherwise it would slide down. But for the price, it's pretty good. The shipping was very fast."
2,Great support but doesn't stay in position,Finally gave it away to Goodwill. After spending every few minutes at my home desk pulling the piece back up from where it slipped down the back of the chair I decided it wasn't worth it - just too frustrating. Ended up buying a new chair instead. Love the chair. But the PosturePro Lumbar Support manufacturer needs to provide the customer with a far better method or methods to attach and position the piece in order for it to be usable.
2,Ok .. Nothing Special,"I looked for a lot of lumbar support and opted for this based on the reviews. However, i did not find it anything special. Just some regular support. Would have to buy something which gives me a firmer support."
1,I bought 2 different lumbar supports; this is the one I RETURNED.,"Does not offer back support--the mesh simply is NOT strong enough. I purchased a different one ($10 more) that was made of a shaped durable foam inside, and only then did I realize how useless this one was.You have been warned!"
1,You can get these at the Dollar Store; exact same kind.,"I never really write reviews, but felt compelled to, heres why:Bought this awhile ago, with mixed results. I had to really stretch the band to get it to around my chair, and it doesnt really support my lower back that well. However, I have used it ever since, and gotten used to having that ""little"" extra support. I paid $9.95 at the time (free shipping), and thought it was a little over-priced, but hey, live and learn.So heres is why I decided to post a review after so long: I was at the Dollar Tree store the other day (99 cents store or something similar if your not in CA), and they have the EXACT same back support for, get it, one dollar! I kid you not. And it wasn't a similar product by any means. Its the exact same product at a fraction of the cost.Bottom line, if you are serious about getting something to support your back, then look elsewhere for a better quality product, or go out and get this same product for $1 (+ tax)"
2,Not good,"My back pain got worst after using it. It's not firm enough to support my back. You definitely don't want to put it in your car because it hurts my lower back when I drive. It's okay to use in the office, but still not as good as my original back support seat cushion."
3,Not as great as I expected,"Although it looks really nice, it slides off the chair very easily. If it stayed put, it would probably provide good support. It still lacks lower back support."
4,mike,works well both on my desk chair and in the car bucket seats.It helps with your posture however you still have to sit straight with your shoulders back for the Posture Pro to be effective
4,Love the lumbar support,This lumbar support gave new life to my old chair at work. No more back pain.
5,Use it everywhere...,"This is actually a very comfortable product - even though it looks like it pushes your lower back way out in the chair. I use it in the car and at my work desk, and it really makes a difference at the end of the day.You may have a little trouble fitting it over certain seats because of the way it's attached."
1,Don't buy it!!!,It does not work. It is the same as nothing! Not worth buying!!If I could I wish I could send it back.
3,back happy,I have a friend who showed me a similar device that was purchased while in China. I saw this and was excited. Although it differs slightly it is a great device. It could be less flexible but I had a firm lumbar pillow that I tucked inside and this modification works well.
2,save your money....,"can not depend on the elastic bands to hold up the PosturePro.ripped right when i tried to pull the elastic band around my mid size office chair, and it was my first time trying it. cheap and bad designi've seen this on a task chair like in the picture and the bottom would slide into the crack between the chair and backrest, not a good thing.right now i just lay the posture support against the backrest (because the elastic band ripped) and when i sit down i adjust the support on my back and press it against the chair to keep it from slipping down.so it works, feels ok but its a hassle to adjust it each time i sit.don't count on the elastic band to hold up the posture support. (i've only tried this on ergonomic office chairs- task chair, mid back, and high back)i saw the posturepro at frys on sale 2 for $15 =(i can use a small rolled up blanket to do the same job, if i could return it i would."
4,Very good inexpensive way to be more comfortable.,"The other reviewers who have mentioned that the rest slides on the chair are correct, at least from my experience. If I wanted the backrest to be placed higher up on the back of my chair, it would probably require repositioning it throughout the day to keep it up higher. Fortunately, it's fine using it where it can rest on the seat of the chair. (In the photo of the product, imagine no space between the bottom of it and the seat of the chair.) It's very comfortable that way. For me, it was an inexpensive way to improve my office chair."
3,Not so good,It slides down the back of the chair and you need to reajust every 5 minutes...should have a different attachement system to hold the back of the chair.Luiz
4,"good for the money, not for all chairs","This product gives nice back support, and can be adjusted for most chairs. However, if you have a chair that already has a slight curve for lumbar support, it may jut too far out (as was my case). I have used it on several chairs at home, and it works well. I have yet to try it in my car. For my office, I ended up going with a a tempurpedic cushion. It is more easy to adjust on my office chair, but costs more too."
1,not even worth a penny,"waste of money, back support is not firm enough. A small pillow will do a better job than this one."
4,Good for the price,"This support was surprisingly sturdy for the price, I was rather expecting very thin and flimsy material. Sitting in my chair definitely feels better with this support. As for the angle of the arch; it is pretty severe. Only because a properly aligned chair should allow you lean all the way in the chair whilst staying aligned, but this support will have you bending over back a bit if you try to lean back. But since I don't feel the need to lean back with this support, its pretty comfortable. Have yet to try it in the car, but I'm feeling like a simple lumbar support pillow with less of a severe arch would be more suited for the car."
2,L5 S1 Surgery: Sensitive back,"My husband got this as a white elephant gift this past year. It was brand new. It didn't take long to realize why it was given away. This product is way too flimsy & cheap to provide the amount of support that my body needs. The middle strap is just for holding the product onto the chair. When I put my back against it, it collapses against the chair quite a bit. I had an unsuccessful surgery on my lower lumbar & my back needs a lot of support. If you are looking for a cheap choice that will just make that seat at work a little better, than this might be worth it. BUT if you are looking for a quality product for a sore back or chronic back pain, this is not for you. I am looking into the Mediflow lumbar support backrest as my next purchase. It may be 3X the price, but my experience with the Chiroflow pillow makes me think that this might be a quality choice."
1,Not worth it,The goodIt's cheap.The badProvides almost no support. I'm 5'3 110 pounds and I crush the thing when I sit back in my office chair.It won't stay in place on the chair and it's similar to the one pictured.
1,Don't waste your money,"This item is not worth it. It metal frame structure is not very sturdy and after using this for a week the frame bent a bit so it does nothing to keep your lower back in the right position. I also bought a memory foam lumbar support cushion and use that now, it works great."
3,"Effective, but slips down the chair","Cheap and effective, but keeps slipping to the bottom of the chair. Only if there was some way to hold it in place. Not too useful if your chair is already ""a bit ergonomic"" (has got a forward curve near the bottom)."
1,Throw-away product,"Bought several of this exact product at a dollar store for, go figure, $1 each. It isn't even worth that. The quality is horrible. The elestic bands wear out far too quickly. Flimsy, cheap, doesn't stay in place on the chair even when new. They are cheap for a reason. Too cheap."
5,posture pro lumbar support,",The Posture Pro Lumbar Support from Angel Sales gives the added depth to my chair just where I need it, in the middle of my back. However,probably, because my chair is leather I need to adjust it most of the time when I sit down to get it in the right place. This is not a difficult problem and should not stop you from buying it. Actually if you have a pain at your hip on occasion it slips nicely into a support in that region too."
2,Flimsy,"Works if you stuff a pillow between it and the chair. Tends to slip into the seam between the seat and the back, so it provides minimal support. Better than nothing."
3,Not the best,"I got this for my car, works better than nothing but the mesh is to flexible and doesn't give all the support I was looking for."
4,So great!!,"While it lasted. Granted, I used this in my car instead of on a chair. If you're using this for a chair then it definitely deserves 5/5. The strap is too short to fit over a driver's seat (obviously, but I needed this for my car so I pushed my luck). I was able to make it fit on my driver's seat, but it was VERY tight and ended up breaking a few months later. Until it broke, it was the greatest thing ever! I loved it!"
1,Money For Nothing,This was a bad choice. This item arrived dirty and poorly made to the extent it would not accept batteries.
3,Earthshine,Earthshine is a good book if you are looking for a good read to see how the world is. I liked the book but there were some points where I thought Nelson made the book to dissapointing. For example the let down in the Hungry Valley. I thought she should have made it like Isiah hoped it would be instead of how things would normally end. I personally dont like the Tuck Everlasting endings where theres a big twist in the end. The detail Nelson put in the book is riviting and exciting over all. This is a good down to Earth book and I would give it at least 2 stars anyday (I am a tough critic.)
1,Contain BPA,"For those concerned about BPA: Second Nature bottles contain BPA. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)"
2,Baby didn't like this!,"I thought this bottle would help us with our quest to have our breastfed baby tolerate and take a bottle. It didn't. She hated the bottle, the nipple is way too hard. If you are looking for a good transitional bottle for a baby who doesn't want to take any bottle, this isn't for you. After spend a ton of money on several different bottle types, my baby will only take a NUK bottle with a slanted nipple, and she takes it happily."
2,not for general anxiety,"I bought this book for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it is not very helpful for this. It claims to work for it, but the tips soley focus on panic attacks and agoraphobia, and not long term chronic anxiety which doesn't involve immediate fears."
3,My Review,"This book is good for learning how to use positive ""B"" talk. It is written by two authors which I think can sometimes get a little confusing. I seem to like Judith Bemis ""The power of Acceptance"" better. That book is longer and explains alot more detail of dealing with your anxiety."
4,Very Helpful,"I have not finished the book in whole, but thus far it has been very helpful to me! I have been determined to work though this without tons of medications and things provided in this book help me with this goal!"
5,It has been over 60 years since I have read it. It was good,"At the time that I read it, it was a book that you didn't want to put down. It was a story of a family on the Salmon river in the wilds of Idaho that covered about 6 to 10 years of their life, and kept your attention from cover to cover.Bi"
3,Crue Still Rocks!,"Great sound quality and post production. A couple too many ballads, but what can you expect from a genuine hair band! Worth a listen for any old school Crue fan, probably for the new school fans as well."
3,getting better,"I have yet to see executive's defragger outperform O&O; Defragger software or Raxco's Perfectdisk.If I were to place these 3 programs, it would be:1st place - O&O; Defrag V8.02nd place - Raxco perfect disk V7.03rd - Winternal's defragger utility/ Executive's ""diskkeeper""O&O; is like THE defragger to use.A real, true ""swiss army knife"" of defragger's.Choose ""HOW"" you defrag a system, based upon how it is used.You have like 6 ways to defrag, based upon how YOU want it done.[Example: workstation, file server, database server, etc]All of the above mentioned companies offer DEMOs of their programs.Do yourself a favor and ""test-drive"" each product BEFORE you buy."
2,Difficult to read,"I don't think this book is that good, for it's written in such a style that I find it difficult to read. The author should have at his service a better editor, which might have helped his to re-arrangement certain parts of the book in a more logical way."
5,"An extraordinary ""documentary"" book","Extraordinary photography, combined with intelligent, concise, even poetic text. I am English, but I have lived in Boston for many years. Barbados is perhaps my favorite island in the Caribbean--""Little England"" as it is known. This book captures Barbados as I have seen no other book do ... perhaps because it focuses on the small things: flowers, the black-belly sheep, the young schoolgirl gazing deep into the camera ... The picture captions are concise, but packed with information; the author chooses and rations his words carefully! There's also, for those who want it, a complete text which conveys the history of the island. A small quibble: there's no information about hotels, restaurants, etc. However, this is not a guidebook, but rather a coffee-table ""documentary"" book, and in that department it is to my mind incomparable."
5,Superb!,"Having travelled to Barbados many times over the past twenty years (and I lived there for a time as well), I have to say this is the finest and most complete ""coffee-table"" book on the island that I have ever seen. It is large-format, filled with superb color photographs (including a number of aerial shots, as well as some archival photographs of Barbados in the mid-20th century). The text gives you a concise, intelligent overview of the island's history. I've given a number of copies to friends who love the island. The jacket blurb says the author was once a Peace Corps Volunteer, and it shows ... this is a real in-depth portrait, not just ""post-cardy"" superficial coverage. I have several other books on Barbados, but this one is in a class by itself."
2,"Don't stomp your feet, sneeze, or slam the door.","We have 50+ of these cards at work and I have 4 at home. I have never seen a more ""fragile"" PCI card. If you slam a door or stomp your feet near the PC, this card may very well cease to function on the next reboot. God forbid you attempt to move the tower. Every other day, someone has a malfunctioning card which needs to be jiggled, removed and reinserted, or otherwise screwed with.When it does actually work, the connection is usually good."
2,No Vista Support,1st Card DOA. Replacement worked ok with Windows XP. No Vista support is unacceptable for a card in this price range. If you plan on going to Vista soon skip this card until(if ever) vista drivers ship.
1,practically it cannot be used,"It will not stay in the PCI slot. Any vibration of the PC case will disconnect it and make it unusable. If you're lucky you'll ""only"" need a restart, if not it needs to be plugged out and in again (sometimes repeatedly) to make it work.The wireless signal looked ok for the brief moments when it stayed in contact with the PCI slot. But one will not get to enjoy it for long.."
4,Let them eat cake?,"If collecting the heads of French royals is too bloody for you then avoid this game. Really its not so bad, they are are smiling and healthy looking on the cards. Its a fun game, 3 rounds part luck and part skill. Will you get negative points by collecting a hero of the people, or will you have an action card that allows you to shuffle the line and collect a royal at the last minute. Its a quick and fun game. I recommend it."
4,"Quick, easy, and most importantly: fun.","This is a great game for anyone who has 20-25 minutes and wants to have fun. I've played it with people from 8-63 and there are always laughs. It's easy to teach (fewer than 5 minutes), game play moves swiftly, and most people have a shot at winning right until the end. You don't have to be a major mathmetician to figure things out, the highest number is 5 and you add and subtract a little from there. I did take a star off, because I agree that instructions are a bit vague with regards to a few of the action cards. That was brought up in an earlier review regarding the word ""random"" and a few minor questions have cropped up as I have played that I've just had to kind of make up answers for. Overall, a great game for friends or family."
5,Entertaining fun for the bigger kids in the family,"Our friend introduced this game to us. Its a great game for Game Night with the grownups. Kids might enjoy it too, but since I don't have any, I couldn't say."
5,Great!!,"This is a really fun card game. It's different than other card games, but very easy to learn. A clever premise. Sometimes I get tired of traditional card games and this one fits the bill. A good game to introduce folks who just play boring traditional games to something different."
3,Not that fun to play with friends,"This is an OK game, is not really loads of fun, you get some action cards and have to collect people to be decapitated from a line of cards (that you can modify with your action cards) each people has a value, at the end the player with the most points win.Whats good its that is really easy to play and set up. but its the type of game that you play with the family (as long as there are kids) its not a game that you will play with people over 20."
3,It's ok but tiresome,"I bought this game based on reviews, but it is a pretty standard card game, not fast moving, and to me it gets pretty tiresome. It doesn't hold my 10 year old's interest, either...so it doesn't get used."
5,Super fun game,"My husband plays ""magic the gathering"" all the time and in an effort to not be bored I picked up this game and have been playing it ever since. The rules are easy enough, you can play with two players though 3 or 4 is more interesting. This really is a ton of fun, if you and your spouse are looking for something to do together and like games, pick this one up!"
5,Guillotine,A quick and fun card/board game for children of all ages. Recommended for families and parties. Worth the low price!
5,Fantastic game,"I love this game. It is short, fun, and different each time. It is very easy to learn and takes about 2 games to master."
4,Fun game,We like playing this game with our friends. The concept is pretty easy to catch on too and it's a low pressure game
5,Excellent game,"Very fun game! The game usually finishes in less than 30 mins, and less than 15 mins if only playing with 2 people. Good mix of strategy and luck allow players of all levels to compete on a relatively equal playing field. It takes 1-3 games to get familiar with all the action cards, but overall the game is learned very quickly. I highly recommend this game."
4,Fun for family and friends,This is a card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. I would recommend for friends and family alike.
5,Guillotine,"Guillotine is fun silliness. I have played this game for years at other people's homes. Finally, got my own copy. The games came in perfect condition!"
4,Guillotine,"This is not a high tech game, but a simple but very fun game in a twisted sort of way. Be aware of the fact that you are fighting to behead the most valuable people, and you'll have a blast. Game is straight forward and easy to learn."
5,We played for hours...,"This along with Poo are my favorite new games since I started looking at games that were not ""mainstream"". The only drawback to this game is that you only get 3 days to accumulate points (or heads). Great game overall!"
5,Fun Filler on Game Night,"I'm not rating this game a 5 because it's one of the best games I've ever played (it's probably more of a 3 or 4), I'm rating it a 5 for what it is: a tremendously fun filler at the beginning or end of the night that doesn't require too much thinking.Really, the only complaint I have is the Piss Boy card. I know that most will probably think that's a funny name and card, but I found it unnecessary and crude. However, if you don't want to play with that card or don't want your kids to play with it, pulling it out of the deck in no way affects the game play. So, don't let that stop you from buying a light game that can be immensely enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike."
2,"Be cautious, this set may not be what you're looking for - -","This is a lightweight product. It doesn't feel good in the hand, but I don't think it will come apart or loosen. Sharp, but doesn't hold an edge well. After one hand washing, blade appears likely to stain. I own other Sabatier knives which are of a premium quality compared with this set, but for carving, this will do."
3,For the price...,"this set is a great deal. The knife holds and cuts well. The set will probably last a while if proper care is taken (proper drying, regular sharpening, etc..). However, don't expect to impress the French cuisine afficionado; it is made in China!"
3,Wrong book was sent...,"Not just on here to complain but, Greatbuybook sent me the wrong book. They sent me just what to expect when you are expecting...I had to buy another copy of the first year. I left seller feedback about how I couldn't get in touch with them and they sent me and email saying ""If"" I took off the seller feed back that they would refund me my money. I can't rewrite the seller feed back though...Well, the book I got was in ok condition a few smudges on the pages so I guess they didn't screw up too bad, I would not recommend this seller until they got a contact number."
2,Cheap Plastic Light,"The build is cheap and worth less though the bulb and battery has lasted a long time of off and on use. Overall, I would pass on this light."
3,my review,"this dvd is ok it is from cookie jar inc. so they cross promote other programs available, also its only the shows no special features, but still ok i do enjoy watching it"
1,Did not like video,I did not like this video at all. It was boring and did not hold my interest. My grandchildren made the same comment. Just wasn't for me. Don't waste your money
3,Going Kidding,"It is not the best among the US comedies of young adults (either Satanist or Gothics), in which a traditional thirst for riches is miraculously backed with both keeping a bag of money found, and partitioning the inherited assess.It is really a watching for kids or if nowhere better time could be spend on.Actually, it is hard to remember a story context longer than a few days afterwards, anyway."
3,Misnamed,"The USB Protective Cover for Type A Jacks, Pkg/10 is a fine product, but a little misnamed. I wanted something to cover the exposed plugin end of my flash drive. These are better named ""USB Protective Plugs."""
1,Very bad design,"I agree with another reviewer that gave these badly designed caps a much higher rating than I did.Once installed it almost takes a set of pliers to get these things off as the outside portionof the cap is angled the wrong way to get a grip on them, but angled the right way for the mold release process. So what has happened, is that the manufacture in all his vast wisdom has decidedto make his process easier and stick it to his customers; SOUND FAMILIAR?The best way to remedy the problem is to go in and grind grooves on top and bottom of the so called finger holds so that you can actually get a grip on these.THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF ON THIS ONE!"
5,I love it. Not as bad as people say.,People that give this a one star saying it is hard to pull out must have toes as fingers. Just slide your finger nail under they come out easy.
5,Los Sabrosos were the bomb....,"you know, not only do i give this c.d. 5 stars, but i also give their other albums on this site 5 stars as well. not only for the fact that ""yes"" they had a lot of great music at the time, but for one of the biggest reasons about that they were the 1st puerto rican merengue band that did'nt have anything at all with being dominicans (owners, etc...) to make a lot of explosive music and to become so popular in the merengue scene... yes, i strongly believe that they were the gateway for other groups like cana brava, grupo mania, to come and join in taking part in the merengue. yes, they were the 1st ones outside of being dominicans... but of course, mucho respect to all of my quisqueya brothers!!!!!!!!!"
4,Different but works,"This model was different that the model that I was looking for , but it worked and works fine a month later."
3,Does what it needs to do.,We purchased this to accompany our existing two units. Set up was super simple; Just had to replicate the jumper settings under the cover with the existing remote. Same build quality as my others. It works. Sometimes you have to push the button straight on or it does not seem to send a signal. For the price I cannot complain too much.UPDATE: The clip is held by a very small phillips screw. It comes loose often. I have almost lost the clip and screw multiple times. I have three of these units and they do the same thing. Also the range seems to vary by each unit. Each had batteries replaced on the same day.
4,Needs wireless receiver to work,"I bought this to work with the Might Mule pedestrian gate lock because I saw other people bought it along with the lock and I thought it would be very convenient to have. Unfortunately, it didn't say anywhere that you also needed to purchase the Mighty Mule RB709U-NB Garage Door Receiver in order for it to work. Have just ordered the receiver, so I am sure it will be up and running soon."
5,correction made,"we were not sent the quantity purchased of this item, but were charged for it. I called and the company quickly sent the missing items. Ended up very pleased with their quick response of a mistake on their part."
5,Convient,It is really nice to have the easy way of getting into the gatewithout getting out of your vehicle. You have to be close to thegate in order to push this remote but that doesn't really matter to us.
4,mighty mule remote control,"The transmitter works great, has a long range reception. It is small, I keep it in my shirt pocket to use it around the farm. The only problem I've had is the button sticks out and is easy to accidentally press with out realizing it. I made a plastic cover, so as to make it more difficult to trigger."
4,good to have,"Since only one came with the gate and two of us use the gate, it was always disappearing. It's nice to have two now in case the first one really got lost. It came with instructions, which were very easy to follow. The only complaint I have is that they are both too sensitive when you don't want them to be, and not sensitive enough when you DO want them to be."
5,excellent service,"very fast!! two thumbs up!!! product is as described and very fast response, prizes are very resonable ill buy again"
5,does as it out to -- opens my mighty mule,Works the way it should. Opens my mighty mule every time. Its small and compact and I would recommend it.
4,Deserves a 5 Stars Except...,"This book is really good. It's a disturbing look at how the criminal justice system can go terribly wrong. I don't know if the WM Three really did it or not, although I lean definitely toward the not. What I do know is that they received a raw deal from the criminal justice system in their arrest and trials. Reasonable doubt seems clearly there.You can't go wrong with this book and if you are interested in the case I think it is a must read. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it is too biased towards the defense. It's not that I don't agree that the prosecution, the judge, the cops, and the community were unfair to the defendants, I do. I just think the author went too far in her advocacy and should have tried to be more objective in her analysis.In any case don't let this quibble of mine discourage you from this otherwise excellent book. It is extremely informative and important. I highly recommend it."
4,Very surprising story...,Mara Leveritt did a great job describing the facts of the WM3 case and the witch hunt that convictedThem. Well written and very informative.
2,"Fascinating case, VERY dry writing","I realize the purpose of this book was to examine all the evidence and document the case as thoroughly as possible. That was certainly accomplished. However, it was as exciting to read as a police report or a poorly written textbok. If you're interested in an exhaustive study, read this. If you are looking for a good book about a fascinating case and a terrible miscarriage of justice, look elsewhere."
4,Good Service,I received my book quickly and in great condition. It's not a common item so I was glad to be able to get it. Thanks
3,This is a hard read.,"I think the book is educational for those who know nothing about the Memphis Three, but it is just a boring read."
4,I wish I could give this 5 stars!,"If you are interested in true crume, justice, or specifically the case of the West Memphis Three, this is a must read book. Leveritt lays out the case meticulously and endeavors to present an unbiased look at an extreme miscarriage of justice. I would love to give the book five stars but the book does have one major flaw: it is the most annoyingly written book I've ever encountered. Instead of writing a seamless book with a few end notes, Leveritt writes half of the book in the end notes, causing the reader to constantly flip back to the notes in order to read some key piece of information. There is no logical reason for this end note oddity and it makes the book seem much longer and a bit tedious.The above objection aside, this book is truly one to read if you are even slightly interested in the case of the West Memphis Three."
5,Biased but Necessary,"Although the chief complaint is the fact that the book contained biases, it still needed to be published and it still proves a point. There is nothing biased about the fact that there was not enough evidence to prove that these three men were guilty. How does a prosecution come off so strong when the police completely ruined the evidence and coerced a mentally challenged boy into a false confession? It is because the town has biases of its own. Also these people were quick to pin the crime on somebody due to its intensity. Now, fourteen years later, the people who committed this homicide still have not been caught. Perhaps they could have if the focus had been taken off the wrong suspects."
1,Leveritt should've done more research.,"If I had a dollar for every incorrect fact Leveritt wrote about Byers, then I could probably take us all out to dinner on it. It's such a shame that she speculated to cast more doubt and seemed to intentionally try to cast the victims' families and Officers in a bad light while trying to make the three convicted child molesting murderers seem like choir boys. It's such a shame that one who is referred to as a journalist fell quite short in the correct information part of that job description. A lot more legwork and a little less baseless insinuation might work in her favor next time, should there be a next time."
1,Umm. . . No,"So what happens with these people die lol? All this money and ""help"" will have died in vain as will the three in jail trying to prove their innocence. You know, the amount of tax money funding these organization to help these people is probably a waste also. . . I mean come on. . . It isn't like they if freed from jail are going to go out and do great things (Cure cancer, stop war ((which would be a bad thing)) or any of that stuff.) Seems like a BIG waste of time and money to free these poor poor 3 people from jail."
4,Good Read,"For true crime fans, this is a dandy. I knew nothing of the case before I read the book, just stumbled on it at the bookstore. Whether or not you believe in the innocence or guilt of these young men, you will be astonished at the abuse of the justice system here.I liked the fact that Leveritt offers the option of a deeper read with some 400 footnotes. Great research. Great read."
4,Couldn't put it down,Good book about a horrible crime. I didn't want to put it down. There is a lot of information I didn't know about in the book. I've seen the HBO Documentary and was in shock of how the trial played out and was embarrassed of the legal system and police force here in Arkansas. Years have passed since I saw the documentary and I saw on the news the 3 men will get a new hearing. The book was a way to go back over details of the case. This case sucks you in! I want to know who did it! It's so scary to know that the wrong people could be in prison and that there is a monster walking the streets!!!
4,A must for any WM3 supporter,"This book is it. I had read ""Blood of Innocents"" a few years ago and found it to be very inaccurate. Leveritt's research is impeccable. There appeared to be no biased opinion in the writing of this book. The author reported all facts even the ones that made the defendants look bad. Even including those details, it is so obvious that there was just no evidence to convict these three. I am sure many people purchasing this book are already familiar with the case. Even so, I think this book shed a lot of light on things I had little or even no knowldge of. I highly recommend it."
3,FASCINATING!!,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE BOTH SCARY AND FASCINATINGAT THE SAME TIME..THE HORRIBLE WAY THEY WERE TREATED BY THE JUSICESYSTEM...AND THE SCARY WAY THEY WEREE TAKEN FORGRANTED THAT THEY WERE GUILTY...IT WAS HARD TOBELIEVE THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE..NO ONE KNEWWHAT THEY WERE DOING AND COULD CARE LESS.NOW THAT'SSCARY..I LOVE THE WAY DAMIEN KEPT HIS COOL THROUGHIT ALL...FASCINATING..IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS INTHE COURTROOM WITH THEM..GOOD READ AND IT WAS TRUE..
2,only moderately interesting,"I would recommend you learn a lot about this case: I don't necessarily recommend reading this book, as I regard it as nothing special.In fact, it makes the original HBO documentary, PARADISE LOST, seem even more amazing, since when you finish this you really don't feel that you saw or understood anything more than when you watched that. It doesn't add much.One serious problem is that this book came out in 2002, so it doesn't reflect the complete turnaround of thinking that occurred when, in 2007, new forensic evidence revealed that the previously mysterious DNA found at the crime scene matched Terry Hobbs'.. . . not to mention their being freed on 19 August 2011 and how that came about."
3,"Good, but very biased","I bought this book for my Kindle right after the release of the West Memphis 3 this week. I had seen the documentaries Paradise Lost One & Two, and even though they were also biased for the defense, I came away pretty convinced they did this crime. I saw quite a few reviews on here that says this book is very unbiased either way. I'm only to 38% of the book's total length on my Kindle & had to stop and write...this woman should have been one of their attornys. Every fact she mentions, she skews it toward this being a railroaded case.That said, I did learn some new facts about how the bodies were found (which I won't mention here to spoil any of the actual facts in the book) and I was suprised at that information as I had thought I'd read a lot about this case online, but nowhere else did I see this basic information about where the bodies originally were.This book is well written & easy to read, but in my opinion, skewed very much toward the defendant's side."
4,Sturdy Hardshell Case...,"I am a novice to bass guitars in general and hardshell cases in particular. However, when I was looking for an appropriate case (the one that came with my bass is flimsy), I came across a hardshell case that, by the name, is designed for my Dean Edge 09 metallic red bass guitar. The Dean hardshell case for Edge Bass Guitars fits the bill perfectly. The guitar body fits nice and snug which I like. It has ample space for your bass guitar extras (i.e. pick, straps, cords, etc.). The only problem that I have and it's really quite minor is that if the case was built to accommodate the Dean bass guitar and especially the Edge, then why is there so much space between the top of the guitar and the end of the case? Are there other Dean basses that need more space? A minor deduction to be sure but an excellent case for those beginning their journey with the bass. I recommend this case."
5,Excellent stuff,"I bought this when a local Pep Boys went out of business real cheap. Well I've used a lot detailer's and this is a real good one. I was very surprised at the slickness it left. For this price it's worth it. I would buy it again. It cleans excellent. I bet no one in my area thought it was any good because there were 4 more bottle left. After I use it on the car in Pep Boy's parking lot, I ran back in and bought the rest."
1,Tail indeed.,"I'd like to say that there's something redeemable about this release, but there isn't. It's un-informed, uninspired, and uninteresting. Gibbon clearly knows a bit about the band - but just enough to get him into trouble by saying things that illustrate how little he knows.And regardless of whether he gets it right, he doesn't take it anywhere. There's no depth, no excitement, no important reflectoin. I'd rather read what YOU, yes you reading this review, would write about your experiences on a tour, because you probably wouldn't presume to take 240 pages and ten bucks to do it, and couldn't possibly have as little to say for it."
1,This was a really bad read,"Unless you want a horrible misrepresentation of the scene, do not read this book. Sean complains most of the time and I am not even sure if he ever had fun. To sum up this book, I would say it is about a guy who hates camping, hates crowds, is too afraid to do interviews, gets a hotel at Deercreek (anyone who does not camp at Deercreek is out of their minds), cannot handle a dank brownie, has no concept of phamily, misjudges everyone, and overall is an idiot. I am not even sure why he wrote this book and why anyone published it. If you want to get a taste of what tour is like, shut your eyes envision the greatest time in the world and smile. Do not listen to Sean because it is obvious he never has had this feeling."
1,Horrendous,This book was horrible. They picked the wrong guy to write a book about Phish tour. My dog ate it. seriously.
3,"if it was so bad, how come i finished it?","Yes, the author is self-absorbed, but then, what writer isn't? As someone who has wanted to write a book about Phish for some time now, i was excited to read this. i was disappointed with his quick-to-judge attitudes, his preconceived notions, and his blatant disregard for everything that Phish stands for. How can one get an accurate view of something when he constantly remains an outsider? He smugly writes of how ""computers don't matter out here"" while he himself is TYPING ON HIS LAPTOP.however, just b/c i think he made an abomination of the tour scene, that doesn't mean it wasn't well written. sure, i disagreed with him every other page and wanted to throw the book across the room, but instead, i kept reading. and yes, the chapter about 98degrees was a bit much.he's mocking us, i believe, just to get a rise out of us. and we played right into his hands and bought the book. Touche."
1,Not so phunky.,I have yet to read this book for myself. However all reviews i have read have not been too hot. maybe im just a snobby reader. Dont let it stop you from loving phish though. :)
4,Interesting and Insightful Look at Life on Tour with Phish,"Sean Gibbson is able to capture some magical momments that I too have shared on tour. He finds the essence of why tour kids exist in today's world, and why this lure towards tour is so grand. Easy and enjoyable reading. I recommend it to anyone interested in the phish experience."
1,What's the point,"There is an occasional insight here, but ultimately this book is embarassing. You know that horrible scene in Bittersweet Motel with the two guys sitting talking about the difference between girls who ride in the jeeps and girls who ride in the microbuses? Imagine if those people went on tour and wrote a book about it."
2,High Expectations,"When I recieved my copy of 'Run Like an Antelope' I eagerly read the back cover - and was immediately excited about the book. However as Sean Gibbon's story progressed I could not help but find myself dissapointed. Having attended over fifty Phish shows - and doing most of the tour Mr. Gibbon writes of - I was amazed at his lask of understanding of the true meaning of Phish. He constantly complains about how his tour was difficult, with backstage passes and hotel rooms, things that my friends and I would kill for. The author calls himself a Phish fan, and seems to enjoy the music (the best writing in the book occurs when he writes of his passion for the music), but he needs to realize all the positive things about Phish fans, not just the negative."
2,Also in agreement with Adam Cook,"Like Adam, I too bought this book based on something I read on the back cover. It's there that Sean Gibbon is compared to Bill Bryson, whose books never fail to make me laugh out loud. I laughed harder while reading Adam's brief review of the book than I did throughout the 217 pages of the book, with the exception of the few times I chuckled and shook my head at Sean Gibbon's lack of knowledge about his subject and his audience."
1,Blunders in Journalism,"This book was EXTREMELY dissapointing. Much of the book is filled with Gibbon's lamentations about the inability to write, the inability to interview people, and the inability to really connect with his girlfriend via his cell phone. The few insights he makes about the tour and the people on it are watery and short-sighted, at best."
1,Pathetic,"Oh my God. Many of my thoughts only reiterate the majority of reviews posted prior to mine.To say this is a ""book"", is an insult to literature and literature fans throughout the world.I cannot even believe I have to say this, buy this is a grave injustice to fans of music, Phish, (and the Grateful Dead).It's more of a self-serving diary than anything else.And OMD what a lame-a$$. He seemed to hate everything, and yet stated he was a longtime fan. WTF?LMAO - he couldn't handle a brownie. Not keeping score, but give me one break please.BTW Sean, did you like ANY of the music played? Gee, tough to get paid to follow Phish for a summer tour. Sorry bro"
1,roll like a cantelope...,that's right roll like a cantelope past this one maybe a book that exudes phish's musical expertise would be more profound.
1,a piece of ....,"there is no value to this book from the author or from his ""experiences"" on the road. for someone who claims to be a phish fan, the first insult was that he couldn't grasp any meaning from the lyrics in ""chalk dust torture"" and his inability to come up with anything worthwhile elluded him for the rest of his ramblings. a waste of time and money, for me and for his publisher"
2,Openminded when opening the book,"I went into this book with little to no knowledge of the band or the phenomenon beyond what I know of the Dead. I expected more when I bought it. I was disappointed.The guy gave his view, but it did seem that he was miserable most of the time. I laughed HARD over the brownie incident and thought he gave some great quotes from other fans.I thought he caputered the spirit in parts, but HE, himself didn't seem to get into the spirit...other than the dancing he described. I got the impression he didn't want to act like he enjoyed too much for fear of disappointing Jill (the girlfriend).I think this would have been much more of an exciting adventure for another person, but obviously to him, this was what it was for him. I don't down him for that, but the book seems to sell because of the band, I think the spirit would have been captured by a more fun-loving person."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I don't have enough words to describe the horrible time I had reading this empty book. Sad, really, since the potential was there for an amazing book. I am dissapointed to no end and was actually cursing the writer out loud during the few hours it took to read this book. He can't handle a brownie! He thought paintballs were drugs...oh man... Utterly unforgivable...i will trade my copy to any phan with a live show, that wants to read this and laugh! spookypaw@yahoo.com"
4,Just phine.,"Screw these other reviewers, man. If you set aside your Phandom for a moment, you'll find a perfectly palatable road/tour memoir. Gibbon is an enjoyable narrator, and that he has real criticisms of the world he explores shouldn't be held against him. Deal with it."
1,"If you are a phan, this book will not tell you anything new","Imagine going on Phish tour with someone who complained the whole time, did not talk to anyone, did not really love the music, and could not handle eating a brownie. That is what this book is like. I would have loved to see the shows that this guy went to, and I was hoping for more POSITIVE descriptions of the scene and the music. Well, Gibbon just complained and talked about randomess instead.But, if you are bored, it is interesting to read. I wouldn't buy it though, because you won't want to read it again."
1,What a downer!!!,"Whenever I first saw this book on sale at Barnes and Noble, I quickly snatched it up and was ecstatic to find such a book. I had high hopes for this book as the author, Sean Gibbons, compared the project to the gonzo journalism of the late H.S. Thompson.I have read 90% of the Thompson stuff and will say that this book is a pile of dung in comparison. This book lacks creativity and insight, the two things that made Thompson a genius.Comparisons aside, the author clearly missed out on what made being a phish fan so great, a sense of community amongst the fans. Gibbons almost seems to ridicule the people who will most likely be reading this book (Phish fans).My recommendation to everyone is to save your money."
1,Superficial at best,"I picked this book up recently and was really disappointed in it. I thought it missed the deeper changes that the web is bringing to culture and instead focused on superficial solutions that missed the point completely. My focusing on what the big ministries were doing, he missed the emerging trends on the net and really missed a chance to engage with the rest of the digital culture."
5,A must-read for visionary leaders!,"A substantive and crystal clear guide, especially for CEOs. Light takes years of data provided by the Rand Corporation and distills them into the 4 essential pillars to establish high performing organizations and the operating principles of ""robust organizations."" Most useful of all is Light's guidance in facilitating organizational change -- thereby enabling readers who are leaders (or consultants to leaders) to advance organizations to new heights of performance for today's and tomorrow's challenging environments. Light shines light on the path for success !!"
4,Saturday Night Live Halloween,I thought this Saturday Night Halloween was great. The best was Chris Farley as Matt Foley trying to convince the kids about Mischief Night. It was classic he was so funny and it reminded me as a kid going out on Mishchief Nite. The Gay Vampire was great with John Travolta and My son and his friends thought that Rich the Copy Guy was historical. We have watched it over and over again. It was done really well. People are going to really enjoy it.
2,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING,"I'd prefer to have this tape custome, if possible. But since that's a pipe dream, you have to take what they dish out, and this DVD isn't something I'd want to buy if I had known it was so lame. I didn't appreciate or find amusing the Wayne and Garth commentary, and I can't believe they left out Richard Pryor's classic skit in which he spoofs The Exorcist, with Loraine Newman as the possessed girl. Classic SNL from its first seaon, and it was completely left out. Bogus, man!"
3,"It's funny but, buyer beware.","Buyer beware.This dvd is exactly the same as the VHS tape. On the back of the dvd cover, they have a picture of one of the ""Goth kids"" sketches on the back. THERE IS NO GOTH KIDS SKETCH ON THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"I enjoyed it, but wanted more","We love SNL, and Halloween is my favorite, I just wish there were more shows added."
3,ehhhh...it's just okay,"Considering the price of the toy - it was a reasonable purchase. However, I was disappointed in the quality and general appearance."
2,Not recommended for very small businesses!,"Goldmine is great software that looks good on paper and has a lot of built-in functionality. However, after years of using it, I am not sure I made the right choice. It is the most finicky, untested, un-user friendly software I have used. It has caused me and my employees numerous headaches with constant crashes and some data loss. Forget about customer support! You are stuck with high priced third party providers. Forget about bug-free upgrades, Goldmine has released a number of major upgrades with non-functioning elements. Small-businesses without IT departments beware."
2,Best for telemarketers,"This software is extremely powerful. It does EVERYTHING a complex marketing operation would need.BUT... that power comes at a price... and that price is being a cumbersome system to use until you have gone WAY down the learning curve with it. For MOST people trying to do their job with computer software that is easy to use, easy to learn to use (read simple and productive) you should look elsewhere."
2,Bells and whistles you'll never use: unreliable,"This product has many great features, but this is one type of application from which most of require reliability. With this product we have experienced loss of critical data even minutes after it was entered, including loss of appointments scheduled. If you like it when two clients show up at the same time for an appointment, you'll love this product! If not, look elsewhere. And don't count on being able to change to another product. You may not be able to move all your records.Of course, no software is perfect, but with this product you will need to be ready to spend heavily for tech support with no guarantee your problem will be fixed."
4,"Good, but watch your files when you upgrade!",Very good contact management software. A littletricky. When upgrading contact the company forinsight. Can get complicated.
3,Poorly structured,"Useful information but poorly structured. The ""how not to do it"" section actually precedes the ""how to"" section! Also, it should have been designed so that the photos appear on the same page as the instructions even if that means wasting a little white space starting a new page for each exercise."
4,bought as gift,"wife wanted to get a little more work out info and picked out this book. the ""dummies ' series always lays things out nicely and this book was no exception.it's good for the novice or beginner and will provide the basics to get started."
2,Beginners need to know more,"The book does a good job of telling us how to do each exercise, and has some photos that demonstrate well, but it doesn't tell me how different exercises target the same muscles differently. For example, you wouldn't know from reading this book the difference between the tricep pressdown and the tricep kickback. It's important to know when you are trying to put together a workout."
4,Useful and Helpful for Beginners,"This book is great for what it tries to be: an instructive manual for beginning weightlifters. Its approach is very sensible, safe, and stresses proper technique. Even though I've been weightlifting for over 10 years, I found this book a good ""back to the basics"" refresher and have incorporated some of its alternative workout strategies. It also recommends specific programs for different types of athletes, i.e. runners, bikers, etc. The book also has sections on stretching and diet, although they are far less detailed."
4,Good for beginners,"Nicely put together book. The authors cover each muscle group and then give several suggestions on how to exercise each group and then finaly on how to put together your entire routine.The only fault that I found with this book is that the authors went over exercises that used gym equipment, not just free wieghts. This reduced the versatility of the book to those exercising at home."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first Dummies book that I'm disappointed in. Disjointed writing predominates. The overall impression is of short segments of writing thrown together without regard to flow of the material. Two complete readings later, I'm still uncertain as to how to put together a workout program that will fit my needs. Perhaps if some of the space devoted to topics other than weight training (yoga, pilates, supplements and bad advice about nutrition) had been dedicated to rounding out the topic of weight training, it would have been more useful. Too much of a single-gender viewpoint is also apparent."
3,Not so dummies,"Too much text for a dummie like me, id rather see more detailed pics. But nevertheless, good product over all."
4,Ok book for beginners,"This book is great for beginners, however intermediate or adavance lifters would probably find this book less helpful. It just doesn't go indepth enough in advance concepts. This is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5."
3,A good book for beginners.,I would recomend this book to a fledgling weight lifter. Would like to have seen more pictures with the actual instructions.
5,Excellent!,"This is easily one of the best weight lifting books available. While basically written for the novice, many veteran lifters will find valuable information they can use. The section on nutritional supplements is well written and shows that eating a healthy well balanced diet is really all one needs. Quite a bit of money is wasted on expensive powders and pills that contribute very little to an individual's progress. Also, the BodyBlade is mentioned as a supplemental strength training ""device"" and it actually works quite well. I had a chance to use one for a few weeks and it is excellent for increasing muscular endurance and strength. This book is highly recommended."
5,Buy it.,"This is a perfect, no-nonsense introduction for sensible people who want to start a practical program. All the annoying fads, pseudo-science, and general misinformation that clutter the health media is soundly rejected. Good for people who want just the facts."
3,Basics,"Hard to read through, but great to get very basic information and demonstrations of the basic exercises.If you're coming at it from the standpoint the title suggests, ""weight training for dummies"" get it.Does dispel some of the more persistant myths of weight training, such as that droll concept of light weight, high reps."
5,book review,the book weight training for dumminies arrived in great shape.it looks brand new the book contents are great and easy to understand. i would recomend it to anyone.
3,I'm still confused.,"I'm a beginner.I feel like the book has scattered information and certain important details are missing. For instance, they don't really explain how to get create a workout. They sort of give you guidelines in pages of text, but I'm still confused. They give you sample workout routines but don't explain the choices they made.The exercises they show need to be more detailed. They need to show arrows of motion with certain ones like the Pelvic Tilt. I'm still not quite sure how to accomplish that and I don't want to hurt my back doing it wrong.I'm just very disappointed in the book. It's an OK reference, but I don't think it is good enough for a beginner's book."
2,Stay Away,"Shallow coverage and not enough detail to really help build a program. the author at one point claims she hit a guy between the legs with a weight for saying something she didn't like. Should be called ""A Woman's View on Weightlifting."": ""Make sure not to make noises when you lift..."" Try ""Brother Iron - Sister Steel"" for more serious coverage."
3,Great for beginners...,"but I really needed the next level. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book and is loaded with information. Unfortunately, the first third of the book was basic, like ""this is a weight"" and ""these are barbells."" The last third didn't really involve weight training at all, but talked about yoga and Pilates.The sections that covered actual weight training and exercise routines was very good, but not as in-depth as I would have liked. It seems to me that ""Fitness for Dummies"" should have covered the stretching and yoga. I would have liked to seen more on just weight training.But, if you've never - and I do mean never - been exposed to weight training, then this book is for you."
2,Not for the serious!,"This book reads as though it was written by the staff from the television show, ""The View"". Jez..."
2,Could be better,"This book can be adequate for a beginner but for an intermediate or a more advanced trainer it is no good. Especially it lacked exact descriptions of many moves, and in vain it classifies many moves as 'advanced' although there is nothing 'advanced' in them. Also more precise advices on how-to-do and how-not-to-do different moves with better pictures would be a definite advantage. Additionally, weight training nutrition should be covered in much more detail. I think the next edition of this book could benefit from having a male author among the authors (nothing against female writers really). This could sometimes bring an alternative view to things."
2,for women,this book is for women in one of the chapters it tells you that you cannot lose weight by excersing with weights this book after reading it is pretty much designed for women by women and is pretty much useless to men
1,May be beneficial for dummies and beginners,"I'm not sure why I bought this book because the title is rather demeaning. Being somewhat of a novice weight lifter (6 months now) I thought that I might learn something from this book, however, after previously reading Muscle Mechanics, Target Bodybuilding, and Serious Strenght Training, it was very elementary and not at all informative for me, but, maybe for someone that has never seen a barbell, a dumbell or a universal gym, this book might be beneficial."
4,A helpful read,"I learned a lot from this book and enjoyed the tone of it (although ""Idiots' guide to..."" would have been too much for me. I can recommend this book to somebody who is just starting out. I think this is perfect for somebody who is working out with a multi-gym machine or with no machines at home. Actually the parts I enjoyed most were not the Exercise sections. I chose ""Teach Yourself Visually Weight Training"" over this initially because that one shows and explains exercises precisely for more machines that are in my gym. I found it helpful to know common mistakes and appreciate resources on books, videos and Internet sites. I generally like Dummies series and I intend to buy ""Fit over 40"" one next."
3,Would rate higher if it were 3 dimensional.,"It's nice, but I wish it did not have a ""backside,"" I bought it to put on a necklace I made for a friend. It looks nice and she likes it, so I'm okay with it."
2,Caveat emptor!,"I bought this 4-disc set for a puny fifteen bucks, and as the clerk rang it up at the register, I thought it was too good to be true. Well, it was. Many of the artists--Muddy Waters, Ray Charles, Billie Holiday--are represented by second- or third-rate performances. I suppose that was to be expected. But to add insult to injury, Time Music has overdubbed many of the group performances with a studio band, presumably to add some hi-fi gloss to rougher period recordings. They note this ghastly practice in tiny type on the bottom of the box, but I missed it. That leaves a clutch of decent stuff by solo performers--Mississippi John Hurt, Leadbelly, and so forth--that couldn't be overdubbed. Still, if you want some classic blues treasures, buy a greatest hits package by Muddy Waters or Ray Charles or Howlin' Wolf, and give this meretricious bundle a miss."
2,Good but not great,This book is pretty good but its not the best book I've seen.It only talks about the major events of the war and it does'nt have the tiny bits that nobody knows about thaat makes it interesting. I found some new stuff about the japanese but not that much. The major reason that I got this book was for the british and italian submarines which I could'nt find anything that I did'nt already know.Overall ehhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
2,For beginners only,This book's British point-of-view is as hard on Churchill as on Admiral King. Its prose convolutes with constructions as tedious as the Latin forms on which it is based. Those who know little about undersea warfare in WWII may find value here; others should delve into the materials from which this synopsis was culled.
1,A Nightmare,"Need I say more than I did in the title ? If you have Windows 98 and/or a cable modem and ethernet card this is just that. Please don't even think of buying it because of compatability issues with your operating system, your server and within the Norton software itself. I did and regretted it for two days while I cleaned up the mess and went back to my older version and all its updates. As others have said Norton's service is arrogant and apallingly bad both on the phone and online."
5,Please reprint your book Mr Brown,THis is a wonderful book for anyone contemplating small or medium boat sailing. Filled with lots of info. and written in the right spirit- fun! Try to find it at your local library or sailing club though...cause spending $35+ on a used book IS NOT FRUGAL!
5,A must read,That book is the best antidote against the well known cabin envy syndrome. Read it and start spending your money on your house where headroom is really needed. Learn to enjoy your small sailboat or get one and sail away.
1,Never showed up after purchase...,"Since I have not received the book after two months, I cannot rate it. I just wonder where it went..."
3,Beautiful little book - not too practical.,"While this book is lovely to look at, it is not really that informative about how to use color in home design."
4,great product!,"i really satisfied from this great product! they are lovely, fun and stable. i didn't give them 5 stars because tha colors are limited- only four colors and because there were no instructions about how many degrees are aloud in the oven."
1,100% waste of money,"I have a similar problem to the other eviewer-sleep line th at stays and stays, so I had heard about these and bought a box- they are difficult to apply, to get off, to tear apart (come in sheets), and uncomfortable. The hurt coming off and no amount of soaking with a wet cloth totally loosens them.Your skin looks smooth after- in a you just pulled off your body hair kind of way. Actually The line at the corner of my mouth looked worse after using these and the pointed corner of the patch made a red divot in my cheek that latsed all day. I don't know how these are supposed to promote collagen since they are paper and glue. I bought some collagen gel patches at the same time. These provided instant results and were more comfortable and easy to use & reuse. Don't waste your time & $$ looking like a craft accident."
4,"Hours of fun, but don't leave it alone with the dog","My puppy is a chewer and seeing how he loves this thing the first time I took it out, I put it away after each play session. I play fetch with him every day with it and he just loves those little balls. So much so that one of them has been gutted with white cotton-looking stuffing spilling out. I think it's the rattling that the balls make that just gets his attention. It's different than any of the other toys I have.May need to get another one soon."
5,Puppy Love,This toy makes my 3 month old French Bulldog very happy. He loves that he can carry it around and that it rattles instead of squeeks. He's had it for almost a month and has yet to do any damage to it.
3,Good knives for inexperience cooks,"I did a lot of comparing and researching before I decided to purchase these knives. When I first got it I was pretty satisfied with its performance. It cuts well and works good. But then after couple months I started noticing the ""inperfections"" of these knives. It rusted when I left it in the sink for a day or two and I had to constantly re-sharpen them. They are good knives for people who do not do a lot of cooking but for me they are simply not good enough. I feel like I have to give them ""special attention"" to keep them in good cutting shape. Overall my experience with them is satisfactory."
1,No value here,Sabatier usually is a quality brand that can be trusted (even though this very obviously is the low end of their product line)so be wary when selecting this product. The edges on the knives I received were chipped and blades overall were flimsy and some were bent.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I knew that a ""$150"" set of knives for ... seemed too good to be true,and it was.This is a ... set of knives all the way.They're cheaply made,cheaply finished,and cheaply packaged.What more could you want!Personaly,I want alot more than this set can offer.These knives are destined to become either my car camping set or garage sale material.They don't belong in a cooks kitchen!Time and time again I learn the old adage,""you get what you pay for"" to be painfully true."
5,Great for New Couples!,"I am completely satisfy with my first set of non-Walmart/Target grade knives. They cut with precision and ease with just about any type of meat or vegetable I've tried so far. They really make cooking a lot of fun. Yeah, they are not the ones Emeril use. But for [the price], they far outperform anything you can buy out there at brick-&-mortars. I even tried making sushi with them, no problem at all. My suggestion for those who are looking for $500 retail up chef quality knives for [less] to stop complaining. They don't just give them away, you know."
4,"Buena calidad, considerando el precio","....después de algunos dias de usarlos, comprobé que la calidad no es mala, adquieren filo fácilmente y lo mantienen por un buen tiempo a diferencia de otros cuchillos... Es cierto que no son cuchillos profesionales, pero creo que fue una excelente compra para quien no es cocinero profesional como yo...."
5,Hilarious.,"The Meanwhile Adventures is hilarious. My 10 year old son was getting a cramp and tears were rolling down our eyes with the nonsense and wit of this book. The author, who is Irish, suggests you read the glossary so you understand some of the local terms - do it! The definitions are a riot!!!!You can picture Roddy sitting in front of you, animatedly telling the story - it's a hoot."
2,Too futuristic,"This book is intriguing if you're one of those star-wars hogging sci-fi nerds, which i am not. If you're normal like me, you will not believe or imagine a single passage in this novel. It is high-tech to the extreme, and not likely to happen in the next couple centuries. Boring plot. Woman gets involved in a dangerous skeem, woman tries to get out, woman tries to save the world from digital crisis, woman is a sexy blonde, you could almost guess the rest of the story. My suggestion is, go for slightly less imaginary and more contemporrary works. you got your stephen kings, your romantic charles dickens, your seductive anne rice's. This is a waste of time."
5,Awesome Christmas present,"Bought this Redskins magnet for my brother-in-law for Christmas. He loved it. About 1 foot squart, great colors. He put it on his truck and liked it so much, he went online and bought himself another one!"
1,OUT OF YOUR MIND,This is such a rip-off. I'm not going to consider buying this until it is discounted by at least 50%. I was going to buy two of them for presents. How does that make you feel...?
5,The most clear and precise 2.1 system out there!,"All of you might be thinking,""why get these when I can get the logitechs for half the price?"". I'll tell you why. Sure, the logitechs sound good, but not nearly as clear as these! The logitechs get very distorted at high levels, because of the type of speakers they use. The monsoons might not have as much bass, but will be more than enough for the computer. They are also very attractive in design. The only down is the price. If you want a decent sounding system on a budget, get the logitechs. But if you desire a little more clarity and very nicely-blended music, and are willing to pay the extra bucks, then this is the perfect system for you."
4,Great speakers with decent bass,The two speakers on this system are very clear. The sub provides decent thump but nothing impressive. I use this system to play music on my computer and like it a lot.
1,Poor software,"Ok, the basis is here. You can manage your accounts, enter items, etc etc. But the layoyt is ghastly, mixed with full links to sell you bank services (car, house financing, etc etc) and the software is so integrated with the Internet that if you're not connected some parts of the help file are not available.Finally, I ran into a bug which clearly impedes me trusting this software. I set a budget and bills. I deleted bills next but these very bills even if not visible at all anymore, were still included in the budget. To sum up, I set $500 for a category in my buget and Money proudly shows $980 in the reports. The budget fonctionnality is therefore useless, and, in my point of view, the entire software, as it's very risky for me to rely on such a hazardous accounts manager."
2,cons greater than pros,"overall, not much different from 2004 with some bugs with online updatingpros: prettier interface, better portfolio features, web integration (not too useful as most people prefer security of their own computers vs. microsoft servers)cons: home page customization options more limited (miss the home view, auto view, etc), online problems (sometimes doesn't sync right, had to reinstall windows to fix this so that the work offline option was showing and so that the downloads wouldn't freeze), slower updates and balancing, toolbar not as customizable as in past, only one color interface instead of three before"
1,Don't upgrade,"I've been a MS Money customer since Money 99. I bought this as an upgrade for Money 2004.Upgrading from Money 2004 was a nightmare. After ""upgrading"", I had difficulty connecting online to brokers such as Fidelity and Vanguard. This worked in Money 2004.The new feature that is most obvious is the new user-interface, which dedicates most of the screen real-estate to ads, downloaded (slowly) from MS Moneycentral. In general, the program runs slower than Money 2004.I haven't found any new feature in the new version that I'd consider useful, or an improvement from Money 2004. It's definitely a step backwards, in terms of reliability, speed, and usability.I've completely removed this product from my system, and reverted to Money 2004."
1,Worst Episode Ever!,"Wholeheartedly concur with the other negative comments. The 2005 version is a huge regression. I, too, had to go back to the 2004 version. If you do attempt the upgrade be forewarned that the 2005 version slightly modifies the old data file, so be sure to backup your earlier Money file in a place where the program cannot find it. My Money file became so badly corrupted after the 2005 version that I had to delete it and start afresh. I wasted an entire Sunday afternoon reentering months of data."
1,Microsoft Money Premium 2005,I have been a user of MSM for over 10 years. I have upgraded to the new version each year and have been satisfied. This version will be the first that I will send back to MS and request a refund.
1,I guess my budget is okay...,"But I wouldn't know because I haven't seen it since I upgraded from 2004. Neither of my computers--both of which are plenty powerful--seems to be able to crack my budget's code. Fortunately, everything else has worked so far.I am perfectly ambivalent about MS. The first three editions of Money I had were great--2004 best of all. But this one is absolutely worthless. I might as well enlist my dog to keep track of my budget: at least he responds. I can look at my statements online without Money; the whole point is its ability to help you plan and respond to your changing needs and expenditures. The messed up Budget feature makes it just a holding tank for data, which a pen and paper can handle just fine.If you have not bought it, don't. Get 2004 or stick with your previous version. All over the net, people are having problems with this software. Bill Gates's budget's probably off too."
2,I found something easier,Microsoft Money was too complicated for me. I needed a simple and supportive program so I joined MoneyPants.com. It's a web-based easy to use financial software that tracks money. Since I DON'T have major investments or complicated finances this system is PERFECT for me. It's colorful and makes me look forward to putting in my transactions every day.
1,They can't even get the,"Ok, so I'm new to financial software. So I decided to try the free trial version of Money Deluxe 2005, even after all the negative reviews on Amazon. Now, this may seem trivial to many, but when I read the download instructions at http://www.microsoft.com/money/freetrial_info.mspx, they say the download file name is ""mnyinst.exe"". So I start the download, and guess what, no mnyinst.exe. Instead, it's downloading ""webinst.exe"". Now, I'm sure this is the install program, but really, if MS can't be attentive enough to get such a simple detail right, do you really trust them with managing your financial information with a PayPal account, getting your bills paid on time, and doing all the other things such a program should do? I don't."
4,NO PROBLEMS HERE,"I recently purchased this product. I am having no problems at all. I downloaded directly from microsoft. The download went smoothly, although a little longer than anticipated. It synchronizes with citi bank, there are no popup ads, nor did my system crash. It did duplicate accounts but I just merged the accounts with one click on the menu. There may have been bugs in the begining, but it seems ok now. There are bitter little souls out there that just like to tear things down. Somebody says it's cool to hate microsoft so they hate microsoft."
1,A waste of time and money...,"After hours of input, the program is difficult to manage; laborious to move around in; and the user's guide doesn't provide much assistance. Look elsewhere for simple, home finance management."
1,You can pay me $1000 to use this product and I won't,"I'm horrified by this product and will not consider using it, here's why:When you use its online statement download feature you have to provide a .NET password login in order to proceed, as this is done YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS UPLOADED to the MSN Money site without any warning and without your consent. In this age of rampant identity theft, do you dare to have all your financial information protected by a single password?I found this out running the trial version and I'm staying with Money 2003."
1,Synchronization Just Doesn't Work,"I will add my two cents to the other reviewers that have had a ""nightmare"" with synchronization. I, too, have found that my accounts which previously existed in Money 2004, do not synchronize properly. I get duplicate accounts created rather than transcations being downloaded to the existing account. Apparently, Microsoft now uses a service called Yodlee for account synchronization and, in my opinion, it just doesn't work. Microsoft Tech Support's solution? Export all transactions from EACH existing account, delete the account, set up a new account, and import all transactions. Yeah, right! If Microsoft won't fix the problem (as they should) it is just as easy for me to convert to Quicken then it is to do what they suggest as a ""fix""."
3,Almost but not quite.,"MS Money for Small Business 2005 has many great features. But unfortunately for a small business such as ours it does not do the trick. While you can import your Outlook contacts into Money, you cannot choose from which folder to import thereby eliminating any flexibility and requiring extensive editing. The big drawback is importing data unless it is in QIF format. If your business has extensive inventory, as does ours, there is no way to import it unless it is in .inv format. Doing a search on MS does not yield one reference to that format: we had hoped to be able to at least convert from Excel--our ideal would have been to convert from QuickBooks. So until MS addresses these critical (for us) needs we will unfortunately have to continue with QuickBooks."
2,The new online features are very buggy,At first I was very pleased with the new online bank transaction downloads via Yodlee. I no longer had to go to my bank's website and download a QIF file to get transactions -- they just appeared. Then all of a sudden that feature just stopped working and transactions no longer got downloaded. Several emails to Microsoft support have gone unanswered for weeks. They apparently are well aware that the Yodlee system is not working properly and are doing nothing to fix it.
1,"I'd Give It a ""Zero"" If I Could","Been a Money user since version 2002 and each upgrade has been a major improvement until 2005. Microsoft actually managed to make this product WORSE with this so-called upgrade. With what I assume was an effort to simplify the user experience, they've created a confounding piece of software that borderlines on completely unusable. After several days using it, I still don't understand even the simplest of tasks such as entering a new record in the registry. I'm hopeful things will indeed be ""simplified"" in version 2006, but until then I'm staying away from this upgrade."
1,Terrible product,"We bought this software, but could not get it to load with the .NET account or access any of our online bank accounts. Basically useless, the help on microsoft website is tantamount to reloading all your other software to 'migrate' to a new admin account to get it to work. Software is not supposed to this hard.I wasted a day on this, please don't do the same."
2,doesn't fit 3/4 cord of wood,"With the dimensions of 14"" X 4' X 12' you get a total capacity of 56 cubic feet. A cord is 128 cubic feet. This thing doesn't even hold a half cord of wood."
2,Almost as easy as reciting the Gettysburg Address in Arabic!,"No matter how complex or simple the subject may be, authors(like this one) need to remember the cardinal rule. Always assume the reader has never touched a PC before. It does no good to regale the readers with your programming knowlegde if you skip over simple stuff like what the commands on the actual software mean. Nowhere in the entire book could I find where it says ""do this to begin a program"". Keep it simple (...)."
1,Avoid this book,"THe book is ok, but the companion Borland C++ builder software ruins everything. You have to request an installation key online. I've been waiting over a week, trying and trying to contact Borland, with no reply whatsoever. Book should be called ""Teach Yourself to Hound Borland For 24 Days"". I only hope it will only take 24 days at this point."
1,waste of money,I bought the book and when I put in the CD I was unable to use the program because I have to wait for the compiler to be emailed to me or mailed to me. I bought the book 2 weeks ago and still have not received the information so I can learn the program.
4,Invaluable,"Simply put, Miss Vera has my dream job. Cross-dressing isn't about slapping on pancake make-up and a thrift store rag... it's about exuding class and glamour and Miss Vera provides the reader with a menagerie of resources to evolve into the quintessential ultra-femme. Viva Vera!"
4,"Crossdressing for Success in many ways,","an intriguing book that takes us into the world of cross-dressing and transgender, by the founder of the premier finishing school.This book does well to dispel myths about those who choose to dress and act opposite their assigned sex. In here are a number of accounts of men who explain why they feel the way they do, and what brings them in this direction.For friends I have who have struggled with their gender, it comes down not to one's sexuality; it all comes down to how they feel about themselves, and what is right for them.Miss Vera offers many tips of the trade, how to shop, how to find the right clothes, how to deal with those interesting male things (body hair, I think is one), and it's a fast read.Some of the photos are interesting, to see the transformations; I'm sorry to say some of them are not that convincing, but others are very much so. You'd meet these people on the street and not know.It will make you think...no doubt about that."
3,Miss Vera's CDfS Review,It is simply a resource book. The resources are not as recent as I would have liked. I expected more.
4,Useful book,Very useful book for those who doesn't have an idea of writing a business plan. I recommend it also to those who have basic knowledge.
2,Just Not Practical,"Having read a few other books about writing a business plan I've got something to compare this to and it does not compare well. First off, nowhere in the book is there at least a template or outline for an actual business plan. There is lots of talk about the sections of the plan, but no plan.Additionally, it regularly tells you that you will learn about such and such in chapter x. However, once you get to chapter x, there is no mention of the previous reference.If I had to write a business plan from this book, I would never be able to start."
1,Lousy book. No info,"This book tells you everything you don't want know, except how to write a business plan.After reading the book, I still don't know how to write a business plan.Don't waste your money, I did.I"
2,The title says it all...,"I'm a business planning consultant and a client just gave me a copy of this book. Way too basic, not enough help on the most important part of any business plan: the financials. If you want to get funded, look for a better book."
1,I don't recommend it.,"I found this book too much focused on ""Mission statements"" ""values"" and ""vision"", which I would expect is your entrepreneural common sense. It includes very little about actually preparing statements or plans. There is only one sample plan at the end for a winery. I didn't find any information on approaching investors. I returned this book and bought Nolo's book instead."
5,Best Of The Best,"This is a Great Tent! No better deal out there! If I had known just how truly wonderful this tent was going to be, I would have paid more for it. It's definitely worth every penny. Lots of room, perfect amound of windows, in all of the right places, and even a place to store watches, cell phones, and flashlights in a small compartment in the inside of the main dome, at the top. It is a Great tent that I would not hesitate to buy again. I also bought this exact one for my sister's wedding present. I Absolutely Love This Tent!"
2,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","Went camping and got soaked. This tent leaked from every corner and left a river of water on the floor. Everything in the tent got soaked for our entire family of 5. Had to pack it up and go to a hotel--can't have 3 kids sleeping in their soaked sleeping bags. And yes, we did seal the tent with seam sealer! Cool design for a tent, but it can't keep out the rain!!"
5,Love to camp.,When I would take the family camping we had a big 2-room tent and although it was easy to set up it was a tall tent and it was old. I went looking for a smaller tent that would be right for us and found this product. I've only had a chance to use it a few times so far but love it. We have 2 queen size air mattress and they fit perfect in each section for sleeping.
3,"Very nice, but takes waaay too long to set up","Unlike some of the other reviewers, I am by no means a regular camper. In fact, if I set this tent up twice a year, it's a lot. I'm amazed by one reviewer's set-up time of 15 min. because it took me over an hour to complete my setup of both tent and fly. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I don't think it's supposed to be that difficult to set-up.One thing's for sure - my family loves the tent with all its room - the kids sleep in one ""wing"", my wife and I in another, and the dogs and luggage/gear occupy the rest of the main room. Tons of room. Other than some condensation on the outer layer in the morning, we haven't had problems with water either. Great value for the price, too."
2,Very Leaky!!!,We bought this tent as a first timer camper for our family. We liked the size and that it had 3 rooms. We were very excited to have a tent of our own as we had borrowed them in the past. The first time we used it everything went well. Set up was quick and easy and it didn't rain. Then next trip it rained and when we found out it was leaking everyhing was soaked soo bad that we had to pack up and go home. We were very disappointed so we returned the tent to the store for a refund. Since we have not bought another tent as we are afraid of the same thing happening. I don't understand how other reviewers can say that this tent did not leak at all?????
5,It's so easy,"The product is amazing! Line key under jar lid, lift and it's pops the jar open. With the safety button released, opening a jar is as easy as just taking off the lid. Should be an arthritis tool of the year. Can't live (or eat) without it. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. One of the best gifts I got for the holidays."
3,"Outstanding Songs, Horrible Production","I was excited to get this album because I had heard a few tracks on mySpace, and they sounded great. Truthfully, the songwriting and singing IS great. The performances are passionate and fun. But UGH!! The production kills the entire album. The songs sound distorted, as if they were a dubbed-over copy of a copy. One of the best produced pop-punk albums I have ever heard is the latest Hawk Nelson album, but many indie punk bands have great production, too (see ""Better Luck Next Time"") and this band needs to invest in that immediately. For songs with this many hooks and that much energy to be produced like that is just a crime. I just wanna get in my car and crank this album because the melodies get stuck in my head. Then I turn it up and it sounds muddled."
3,Fun and Really Educational but takes FOREVER!!,"This game is so nice. It is actually fun to play and all that making change does make your kids really GET making change FAST! The problem is, it takes FOREVER to play - like upwards of 2.5 hours. I made my kids do all their change themselves, so maybe that's why it took us so long. But the whole point of buying this game is the educational value, so making the change for your kids would be pointless. I tried to tweak the game so that it would take less time, but if you do that you lose a TON of the educational value, since in order to have exactly the types of money needed to win the game, the kids really have to think through making change. I am still glad I bought it, but I will not get as much use out of it as I hoped. If the game took 25 minutes I would do it once a week. But at 2.5 hours, it's more likely that we will take it out once in a great while."
3,Mockup of a Good Book,"*Spoiler alert, sort of.*This is a well-written, intriguing mystery about a vanished girl that held my attention to the end. At that point the author reveals that he has no solution to the mystery, and tries to make up for it with some crap philosophy about how nothing is really knowable. Reader feels burned by an author doing only half a job."
5,DEEPLY informative and teaching.,"I found this book a must for anyone wanting to exploit visual limits in skygazing with a telescope. It analyses in depth the average visual acuity and translates the priorly published results ino a guide to get the best possible power to observe anything through a telescope. Then suggest (with lots of examples) a very usseful way of making a observing log. It includes a catalogue with more than 600 deep sky objects, a table wich can be used as a guide to observe them with a telescope an example computer program in Basic and Fortran to be used as a basis to get the best possible conditions to study any object. It helped me to find M1, M81 and M101 in the light poluted place un northwestern Mexico City were I use my 78mm telescope."
3,"heavy, hard-hitting","I wasn't too into this upon first listen, but it grew on me. The singer has a very good screaming voice, and about 80% of the time his singing voice fits with their songs. What I don't like, and this is just an opinion, is that they throw keyboards in here and there. Without the keyboards, this is a very good, straight-forward hardcore band. A more new-school, heavier version of Unbroken if you will. They sing a lot of songs about not getting tail, which gets old after a while. After every song, I find myself thinking- bro, there are more fish in the sea. But, to their credit, they are one of the better bands out there today when they don't do all the trendy stuff. I'd prefer to see them not trying to hard to do the keyboard thing that a lot of bands feel compelled to do for some godawful reason these days."
4,Not bad,"I ended up downloading this cd weeks before it came out... Its not too bad, pretty generic, the music has always been pretty good from this band, but the vocalist is very boring, his screams are like everyone elses, and when he sings it pretty much sounds like every other guy who makes an attempt at singing. But im sure a wave of silly teenagers will think this is just the epitome of ""hardcore"" when it is merely another generic metalcore release. Better then alot of mainstream metal but nothing that will make your mouth drop...."
2,asxwasqws,"Awful. The keyboards don't release songs from their locks of excessive emphasis in obnoxious ""JUMPDAFUP!!1"" breakdowns and formulaic structures. Ok, it's more about attitude than anything. That would be fine, but I have a hard time relating to the emo...tional, straight-edge lyrics. Suffice to say it's an impossibility. Eh, yeah. This is a decent record within the confines of its bloated, suffocated genre, (Which still isn't even worth a listen) but far from the most important album of the year.- Thus says the Pellington"
2,Please!,"Are you kidding me, this isn't progressing this is the exact opposite. Yeah its progressing if like like your hardcore all fluffy. This album has it good moments but over all it is a let down from their previous albums. I really like this band though and I hope their next release gets alot more heavy. If you can find it check out Bleeding Through first album Dust To Ashes, now that's brutal."
2,Bleeding Through has gone soft!!,"After two kick a$#@ albums, bleeding through decided on the truth, they'd sing a lot. Hello hardcore and metal fans, EMO alert. I hate when bands tear it up hardcore and then go and start singing as if they were hanging out with Boys to Men over the weekend. Agony Scene is a perfect example of how a band decides they wanna sing now. Anyway, on The Truth when Bleeding Through are roaring its great but too much singing and affection. One song is nothing but singing. Hello did I buy a Coheed and Cambria cd. What happened to the day when real hardcore stayed hard, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits, Strife etc...."
2,bad,"honestly, i think this is horrible nothing catchy or good about it..all the songs sound the same just nothing syticks out...there last cd was the same thing but a little better. if your gonna buy one bleeding through cd i recommend portrait of the goddess...stay away from this"
5,The Truth Hurts,"The Truth is very brutal, very emotional and very unique. It's hard to pin point exactly what it is about the truth that makes it so great. There are a number of things that make this cd great. The band has stepped up and each person brings something to the album. Everything as a whole is great. Very brutal and very uncompromising. The cd cover shows you what to expect."
2,Necrophilia & Rape Does Not A Good Book Make (But It Helps!),"This book was, well, alright. The problem I think with this book is that it was made to be a XXX story right from the get-go. I can't think of one single character in this book that isn't some sort of degenerate sex fiend. It seems like everyone's had their pornos and hand lotion locked away from them and they will screw anything that walks. The story is relatively weak, like it was built around the sex scenes. Not much for action. This book is definately a keeper if you want something really weird to show your friends at a party. But if you are looking for a REAL vampire novel, stick to Midnight Blue. Lucy Taylor is a fantastic novelist though, but I think she should stick to her own ideas, because her violent-sexual ideas don't seem to really fit into Vampire: The Masquerade. Especially when vampires technically can't have sex anyway."
2,"A disgusting collection of crass, violent porn.","I bought this book expecting a tasteful treatment of vampires & sex. Instead, I received a hundred fifty pages of bloody orifices. That's what it all boils down to, and you don't have to cook it very long to get to that point. There is no tender affection, no gentle seduction, no hint of love. Every character is the same: an evil deviant whose only joy comes from violent sexual violation. No one is left as they had previously been depicted. Lucita, Isabella Giovanni, Sascha Vykos, Victoria Ash... all are now rape-crazed freaks.I exaggerate, but not by much. If this description doesn't appeal to you, then you don't want this book.The best I can say for this book is that it's short."
1,Lids stay NOT re-sealable,"Yes, it open.But NOT ""Lids stay re-sealable"" as JarPop website says.I wanted reuse the jar but lid become crooked and water gonna leak."
5,great product,Plastic Jar openerThis little gadget is terrific. I ordered two and gave one to my neighbor who has arthritis in her hands and she is so grateful to be able to open jars without getting others to help.More independance for the elderly.
5,Most useful tool in my kitchen,I have had one of these jar openers for years and use it all the time. This is one of the most handy tools in my kitchen.I ordered several for Christmas gifts because I could not find them locally. This is a great product.
5,The Healing Sun,Vitamin D is the hottest vitamin at the moment and the best way to get it is naturally under our infamous sun. The author very credibly explains away the media demonization of solar radiation and makes one feel secure in getting out in the sun again.
3,Good overview,"Well written explanation of benefits of sunlight - as opposed to the ridiculous paranoia emanating from the ""slip, slop, slap"" brigade. My only reservation was that there wasn't enough discussion on the ""practicalities"" - eg. how long? at what time of day? etc"
5,Fascinating!,"This is a fascinating read. Richard Hobday takes you through the history of ""heliotherapy"" (sun therapy) and how it was ousted with the discovery of antibiotics, then makes the connection that we, as we live in our sheltered environments in artificial light have disconnected from the natural world and are deprived not only of Vitamin D, ""the sunshine Vitamin,"" but of other not yet understood ways sunlight works on our human system.When doctors used to send tuberculosis patients ""out west"" where the sun shone clearly and strongly, they knew something that's been overlooked by much of modern medicine.,If you've ever suffered from an infectious disease, diabetes, cancer or any of a number of modern diseases, this little book is worth your consideration."
2,Don't spend too much on this one...,"This was a disappointment. The girls are busty, mostly as a result of implants, and seem to put no effort into their performances. I watched it once and re-sold it. Buy it for less than $5.00 and you're OK, but don't pay more."
4,It don't Leak,"I've only a short experience with this filter. I drive a Dodge 3500 Ram Pickup with a 5.7 L Cummins engine. The price on this filter was exceptional, so I bought three. It's their answer to the new non paper type of filters that do a better job of filtering as the media has layers to trap the bigger particulate on the surface in a way that allows the fluid continue flowing almost unhindered. And they say it filters micronic stuff too?What I like about the filter.1. Rough surface all over it so I won't need tools to get it off like I needed with the prior one.2. Price.3. Better media than paper.4. It's Blue5. Supposed to be able to trap more particulate.I can't say more as I've only had it a month.-=Greg=-"
3,Pathway of the Immortal,"Many people interpret the Bible literally, the reasoning ability of today's mind is no longer restricted by the analysis of others. For instance Adam and Eve were never man and woman, but sybolized the descent of Light into the adamic (earth), which then became unknowing, as eve (night and darkness). There is both a literal, but also a much deeper mystical meaning to maze of allegorical sybology in both Old Testament and New Testament. It is fact: One million readers of the Bible will have one milion variances. Clement, Bisop of Alexandria, A.D. 150, states in his Stromateis, ""He cannot explain the mysteries because he should thereby, according to an old proverb, put a sword into the hands of a child."" In view of the illiteracy at the time...I agree. Pathway of the Imortal is written by a Christian Mystic, who has been taught the secrets which have long been hidden by the Church. To really know Jesus - you should read ""Jesus, the True Story by the same author."
1,What does this have to do with Christianity?,"I am startled to read that Elizabeth MacDonald Burrows has spent much or even any time studying the life and ministry of Jesus. Any authentic study of the life of Jesus must begin in the Gospel accounts of the New Testament--the only authority that exists on the life of Jesus. To read the Gospels, is to encounter the historic Jesus who, through his teaching, validates the teachings of the Hebrew Scriptures. If one were to accept the teachings of Jesus, ultimately recognizing him as God's Son, than one must also accept the Hebrew narrative. One could not hold a view of creation, such as that asserted in this book, and believe that Jesus was who he claimed to be--which means one would have to deny not only his teaching but his claim to be God's Son."
2,Its Old,"I have to keep reinstalling the product. And, as its old, it cannot truely protect your machine from the modern viruses; and i have kept up with updates."
1,Not compatible with Win 98,"While Symantec states that Norton Anti Virus 2002 Pro is compatible with Windows 98, I am here to tell you... NOT! It also has some problems working with the Zone Alarm firewall. I had to completely reload Win 98 three times (to include reformatting my hard drive twice) and still could not get the software to work. I tried to resolve the timing conflicts in they system files its install created, registry fixes, loading in safe mode... you name it, I tried it. I consider myself a competent Windows user and I'm stumped. Symantec support could not make this software useable. The tips they passed did not resolve the problem. Instead of ""effortlessly protecting my system"" NAV 2002 Pro turned into 10+ hours of formatting and reloading my system."
2,Difficult to install,It is impossible to install. I found it very difficult and still not be able to. The symantec site is very complex and many issues for installation.
1,Hatchet Job of the Best Supreme Court Justice Ever,"This book is an abomination. Justice William O. Douglas was one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century and probably the greatest United States Supreme Court Justice of all time. But his worldview was a threat to the corporate philosophy of greed and exploitation. Justice Douglass was a passionate environmentalist. If his views had become mainstream we would not be experiencing our current environmental crisis. His enemies and the unprecedented, unwarranted, bizarre attacks against him tell us much about his courage.Murphy is small minded and twisted. The writing and publishing of this book represents a huge waste of paper, which as Douglas would point out comes from TREES: living beings entitled to respect and even to standing in federal court. It's not hard to figure out who funded this hatchet job."
1,Biased and highly inaccurate,"This book gets one star because it is highly inaccurate. It should get no stars, but that is not an option. If anyone thinks Murphy is brilliant, it's only because he manages to completely fool them into thinking what he's written is reality. His research is shoddy and biased. What Murphy's agenda is is anyone's guess, but this book would be better placed in fiction than biography. Maybe someone should make a huge lie out of his life so he knows what it feels like to be slandered in such a way. Shame on you, Murphy."
5,Maybe God Had a Hand in This?,"El Nino tells the Christmas story from the viewpoint of Mary, and stresses the spirituality of Woman, using Biblical texts and poems of Hispanic women. The wonderful music is by composer John Adams. The stunning production, integrating dance and video, was done by enfant terrible Peter Sellars and is equally impressive. Do not be put off by fears that El Nino might be over your head (it seems some viewers could not handle the load of music/song/video/dance, done in an abstract way that asks a lot of the recipient's mind); it works, at all levels. And this Paris debut performance is the only recording making the complete audio-visual experience available. The singers are extraordinary, especially Lorraine Hunt Lieberson and Dawn Upshaw.For years I have used this El Nino as a spiritual exercise, especially at Christmas, and it never fails to melt me down totally, reinforcing my Catholic faith."
5,Best Bridal Shower Gift!,This is the 2nd time I've ordered the Mr. & Mrs. aprons as part of a bridal shower gift. They're always a hit and quality is great!
3,This video offers good demonstration but lack's instruction,"This video is for people familiar with dance or who learn well by watching. The instruction is through demonstration without explaination so a beginner or novice would not do well by using this video. However, the patterns and ammalgamation sequences are unique, stylish, practical, and effective to those with a working knowledge of the dance being demonstrated."
3,Not Bad,"It's not bad but the dancers could be better. Watching those dancers kind of take something away from the steps she is trying to teach. Some of the moves you would NOT use in a nightclub. But to be fair, I did get a little out of this DVD."
4,"The Pink, Slimy Blob!","Goosebumps aired as Fox kids series in the 1990s based on the books by R.L. Stine and followed the Twilight Zone vein, but on the lighter side, besides from each twisted ending.Here we get three more episodes:The Blog that Ate Everyone has aspiring horror writer Zack Beauchamp finding an old typewriter and he types a story about a pink blob that is terrifying everyone. There is one problem with his story, the blob has come to life.My Hairiest Adventure finds Larry Boyd and his band mates trying on the Insta-Tan they found, but they don't get a tan. Instead they start to grow hair.Piano Lessons Can Be Murder tells the tale of Jerry who takes piano lessons from the strange Dr. Shreek, but then Jerry starts seeing ghosts of the teacher's former students.These three classic Goosebumps episodes are great to watch with your kids around Halloween."
5,Excellent Book,"Unlike many popular authors of multi-volume sagas, (who seem to be pressured by their publishers to produce a new installment every year), Colleen McCullough, in her final book on the late Roman Republic, does not disappoint. Although the story is familiar, she kept me enthralled. I was fascinated, for instance, by Cato, Brutus and even Cleopatra.Several reviewers have expressed the wish that McCullough continue writing about ancient Rome and follow the career of Octavian. I would suggest that she go back in time and take up the Punic Wars. Given how she made Marius, Sulla and Caesar come alive, can you imagine what she would do with Scipio Africanus, Aemilius Paulus and Hannibal?"
5,"Up there with I, Claudius","I've recently gotten very into these books and I have to say I think that they are the best works of historical fiction I have seen in a very long time. I was curious however, if anybody knows whether another is in the works?"
3,Hoping for so much more,"I have loved this series passionately, however this send off was extremely disappointing for me. The detail of nuance, variance view of the world was superficial in comparison to all the previous works and it felt as though all she could think about was ending the series one way or another. This book if written as she had the previous ones would have been a book and a half and allowed her to actually show the end of the Republic.I can understand her exhaustion I suppose, but this final book was not up to the standard of the rest of the series and left the series feeling incomplete and tarnished for this fan."
1,"Shipped Wrong Book, Then They Didn't Have It",My experience was not pleasant. They shipped a different book. Then when I contacted them they didn't have the correct book.I had to go back and order it from another vendor.Very disappointed.
1,Is not Smart Solar is by Electric Power!!! Scam!!!!!,"Even tho it says Smart Solar but is actually by electric power, so it misleads people thinking that is by solar. Scam!!!!! don't buy it if u want a solar fountain!!!!! cuz it is NOT!!!!"
3,Lessons from the Light,"If you are looking for a story about one person's NDE experience with visual descriptions, this book is NOT it. To me, this SHORT little book consists of a long list of item-to-item ideas and mantras to live by. Disappointing."
4,Choose life...,"This book is about someone who had no will to live and tried to commit suicide. She tells of her journey into dark after taking an overdose. Christians have always been taught that we aren't to take our own life, it belongs to God, He chose when we were to be born and He is to choose the time we go home to Him. Because Jesus died for us our lives are not our own, they belong to Him. But even though she tried to commit suicide God saved her from the darkness and brought her into His light again. He never leaves usno matter how dark we feel our life is. Just call on Him and He will be there for you."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on a Sonicare,"Don't expect the Sonicare to last more than one year MAXIMUM. The Ni-Cad batteries are designed to fail and CANNOT be replaced. They are actually molded into the case and the unit will be destroyed upon removal, which they reccomend before disposal, since the batteries are TOXIC in the landfill. Don't expect any support from the company, since they are owned by Philips, which has one of the worst customer service records on the planet. Even contacting their website and clicking on their e-mail icon only provides a dead link. What a joke. The replacement heads are obscenely expensive. Save your money and you could buy a hundred decent regular toothbrushes in the same amount of time."
5,Awesome is all I have to say!,"Its an awesome product and everyone has said everything good about this product. I thought I woudl throw in my 2 cents on finding a best bargain on the price.Costco has it for [...] You will need to pay tax, but it still turns out to be cheaper.I dont really need that extra second handle, however, I ordered a replacement charger from Philips, and given the second handle with the extra charger to a friend of mine. Check their site, and call the 1-800 number, and they will ship it to you!Enjoy!"
2,DESIGN DEFECT,"My first 9650 lasted about 2 month. The Power switch button broke and leaked water. Then I bought the second one. It broke after 1 month , Same problem.If you compared 9650 with old model sonicare toothbrush, you can find that the power button on the old model is much bigger than 9650's."
4,Whiter teeth,"The new Philips Sonicare Elite 9650 power toothbrush is fantastic! The reason I did not give it 5 stars but only 4 is because it takes some time to get used to. Different brushing techniques are necessary to make this work; but once you get the hang of it, it is wonderful. My teeth are whiter than they were before and also feel cleaner. Down side: it only comes with one charger and only one special brush head."
1,Impossible to clean and unhygienic,"This is my second Sonicare. We had the Advance but the battery gave up after 2 years. The first Elite was returned because the battery would not hold a charge. Less than a month into the second one I noticed how hard it was to clean. I called Philips and their answer was that it needed to be cleaned with a Q-tip EVERY SINGLE DAY. Q-tips do not work. They cannot get to the impossible to reach places under the gasket below the brush. I tried alcohol, vinegar, dish soap, and hot water. None cleans it. Today, about 6 months old, I soaked it in hydrogen peroxide all day and still the build up inside is not completely gone. I will not buy another Sonicare product unless they make major design improvements."
4,Loads of fun,My newphew loved this. He is two. Good thing about this is that it was big enough for me to get in there with him. Pop Up is very easy too.
3,fun product! my kids love it,"however the quality is not so great it ripped the second day we had it, but the kids can still play."
5,Great Toy!,"My daughter received the bus for her 2nd birthday. She loved it from the start. It's so compact, I took it with me to my parents' the next day. While there I visited a friend whose two boys fell in love with it, too. My daughter, who can't get enough play time with her new toy, now says ""bus"" very distinctly and my husband is thrilled that it disappears at the end of the day (unlike some of her other large toys)! I'll definitely be keeping this item in mind when buying gifts for my friends' children in the future!I took a star off for durability because a loop came unsewn on the the first day. However, that's the only thing that's come undone and the rest has held up very well with 3 very energetic children."
4,great for price!! BUT DOESN'T HAVE A FLOOR!!,"My 10 month old loves this bus... he squeals in delight when we open it up... his 2 year old sister climbs in with him and sings ""wheels on the bus..."" (It WILL come up, so learn the verses!) But I am disappointed that it has several rips along the seams and there is no floor."
2,"watch out, it rips!!","Bought this toy for my two year old's birthday. I have had it ONE week...it is ripped in the front by the words school bus. cute toy, not durable. no rough play, just the tension of it being up made it rip!!"
5,Super Gift,"Although I had read all of the reviews that recommended thistoy, I wasn't really prepared for the effect the ""big yellow school bus"" would have on the children at the birthday party for my two-year old grandson. As soon as the toy ""popped out of the bag"" all of the children present - from 2 to 7 yrs. old - emerged on the school bus. It was difficult to get them to leave their fun for the laser tag game that was the planned event for the party. I wasn't there when the bus was ""squeezed together"" tobe packed away in the mesh bag, but the picture directions were very clear. Thank you, PLAYHUT, for your imagination!"
4,"Not bad, it is fun; Too bad it is not durable",It just took my 3 year old niece 5 minute to break the bus. Overall it is still acceptable.
5,Great Product- Endless Fun and compacts easily for storage,"My daughter (2 1/2) and her friends love playing in this bus- they spend endless hours being the bus driver and driving the kids to school. Also, when they're done, it folds up and slides under the couch for easy storage. Great Product!"
4,This toy is good but is played with in bits and spurts.,"My 4 year old son loved this when he first got it. He and his 3 year old female cousin spent a lot of time playing in it. Most of the time they were trying to crash it! Although he loved it when he got it, he tends to play with it in bits and spurts now. No matter how many times it got crashed though it held up very well."
5,bogeygolfer,While ordering golf balls I decided to pick up some tees. These tees are very good and perfect for the oversized drivers of today. I recomend them to my friends...The composition & strenght of the tees is good. I personaly perfer the white but the natural is of the same quality.
1,MISSING TEES,I received this and it was missing 10 tees..just like one of the other reviews on here.Going to call for a partial refund.Pretty ridiculous business practices going on.Otherwise...these are just golf tees and seem to work fine.
2,Make sure you count them,Seem to be fine tees but the bag looked very short. I counted and there was only 90 all together. For me that merits 2 stars....just send me the right amount jeez. Counting to 100 too hard? 10 short? Unbelievable....I work in a job where I count items like this if I got a vendor who shorted me like this...he surely would have gotten quite the email.
2,T,"I needed these for preschool kids to build fine motor contorl hammering into foam, I hated to pay so much but did not know where else to buy"
3,They break very easily.,"I'm still pretty new to the game so I'm not the best golfer, normally shoot around 100 give or take a few. Anyways, I'm not exactly sure if it's my swing, or the tee. But almost every time I use an iron on these tees they break. My opinion is sort of mixed about these. I somewhat like the fact that they break because I feel like it doesn't slow my swing down (not sure if that even happens) but I hate the fact that they're not durable enough to stand up to the test. You can get a more durable product for the same price at Wal-Mart."
3,good for it's price,I ordered in spite of some of the reviews stating that the count was short. Mine however was right on. They are of decent quality although four of six broke after a few uses each. But in full disclosure this was during hitting balls in the back yard and I am a novice.
3,Not so good quality,"OK - so I read the other reviews where everyone said they got short changed and didn't get 100 tees. We have not counted our yet but I can say that I have seen a couple of tees with rounded, short ends. It just looks like a quality control issue. The tees are not broken, just the pointed end is blunt and maybe a few millimeters short. We'll try the tees soon but just be aware that the quality of these tees are low before you make the purchase."
2,"A tee is a tee, and 100 should be 100....","So, got these tees to fill out an order toget the free shipping and because of the previousreviews I just had to count them.. sure enough, Ireceived only 87. The tees are like any others I'veplayed, but the company has very poor quality control."
5,Thanks,Golf tees were exactly what I needed to replace game parts. I needed an assortment of colors and that was exactly what I received.
1,Wimpy Tees,The cost of the tees were low but the shipping costs high. These tees break easily and I would classify them as one swing tees. I would not buy them again.
4,"They work, nothing special","I liked these tees. They are nothing special, but get the job done. For the price, I don't feel so bad if they break or get lost. I'd recomend them."
2,A Waste,"Didn't last more than 10 mins. with my 1yr old female pitbull, Bella.Very colorful but very flimsy also. A waste of money."
1,Didn't last long,"I purchased a fleece blanket for $3, made both a 32"" and 10"" braided rope toy plus had enough left over for a dog blanket. This toy is loosely braided and literally lasted 5 minutes with my dogs. The toys I made myself are still played with."
2,Didn't last long,My chihuahua loved this but it was ripped in 2 days. He was also able to pull out individual pieces. They are loosely tied together and not sewn. I could have made this myself.
4,Concise,"Heyman's work is a solid, concise overview of key portions in Russian History. Anyone who has studied the depth and complexity involved in Russian history understands the difficulty in doing this, but Heyman did an alright job."
3,"""shining on"" in a new direction","It seems that Apoptygma Berzerk seems to be ""shining on"" in a new direction with a new pop rock sound. Many reviewers are talking about how this is the best song on Apoptygma Berzerk's new album ""You and Me Against the World"", well I agree it does sound excellent. However, this song was composed by Guy Chadwick lead singer of the band ""The House of Love"", the best version being on the self titled album ""The House of Love"" 1990. Give the original a listen, in my opinion it is one of the best rock songs ever produced. It is very cool that Apoptygma Berzerk is paying tribute to this song by redoing it. The problem is that Apoptygma Berzerk's most powerful song on this new album is not composed by them, which is too bad because in the past Apoptygma Berzerk was able to produce their best tracks on their own. I really hope that the new sound (and look) of Apoptygma Berzerk does steer the band too far away from the great music they have produced in the past."
5,The best female blues singer alive,"I never heard of Cafe R&B until I saw them at Buddy Guy's Legends last night and I was absolutely smitten. The lead singer, Roach, is not just a singer. She is a PERFORMER. This chick is a tour de force and belts it out... big time. Imagine a combination of Janis Joplin and Tina Turner on steroids! I think she might be the best blues/R&B singer around. The band is awesome, too. They are high energy and tighter than Ebenezer Scrooge. Their albums are good but pale in comparison to seeing them live. They have a great live album (from 2005) by the way called ""Very Alive"". It contains most of the material on their studio albums. Buy it and be sure to see them if you get a chance. I guarantee that you will be blown away!"
3,Complex but gets the job done,"This product is a little difficult to install and learn. But once you figure it out, it becomes evident how useful it is.It allowed me to do everything I needed in my backup solution. It works with tape media or disk media and fully manages the backup schedule."
1,Very poor product,"I also bought this product and was dissapointed as it simply does not work on my machine. Yes it is easy to create a slideshow that looks and sounds great in the preview, but when I burn it to DVD, either the audio won't play at all , or in one case the speed was 2 times normal speed. Unless you want Alvin and The Chipmonks to do all the music on your slide show- forget this product. Also the support was poor. After two questions they just said ""check the help instructions"", which of cource was no help. I don't recomend this product unless you know in advance the DVD's you burn will play ok. It does not work on my machine."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I bought this, and what a waste! The instructions are about a paragraph long, and the program is NOT user friendly. When I called their technical support program, which is NOT 24 hour or an 800 number, the technicans were out to lunch! What a joke! I really wish that software was returnable!"
2,Mighty Mule makes a good product but their customer service is horrible.,"Let me first say that the key pad works. It functions correctly. I called customer service because I had a question about installation. The first two techs I got were great. When I spoke to ""Mike"" he treated me horribly. I am not an electrician or a professional gate installer. He told me to look at the main circuit board. When I asked him which was the main circuit board (there are three) he responded ""the MAIN one."" When I asked again which was the main one. He said ""It's the MAIN one."" I asked him not to be rude and he got even worse. When I asked to speak with a supervisor he told me that his supervisor wasn't there and would return my call on Monday. Guess what no call back on Monday. When I asked to be transfered to a different tech he said that was impossible. (Yeah Right) I would not buy this product from them their support team needs some SERIOUS work. Get a different brand gate opener."
1,Worst Company to Deal With,"I went down to Home Depot and picked up this item thinking it would be a simple thing to hook up to my gate opener. WRONG!!!! I hooked it up as per instructions. Nothing happened when I entered the code. I called tech support and talked to a guy who said the model I got would not work with my gate opener. He told me I needed a F310 model. I couldn't find one on their website so I called back and talked to another technician who told me that the F137 that I had WOULD work. I was happy to hear that. He told me to go down to the gate and call him back which I did but could not get him back on the line so I talked to another tech who told me it would NOT work.These people who are supposedly ""technicians"" DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT! ONE SAYS ONE THING ANOTHER SAYS ANOTHER THING!!!!! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THESE PRODUCTS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THEM IS TERRIBLE TO DEAL WITH!!!"
1,Wired usage doesn't work,"Purchased keypad after finding that my garage door opener (1970's but working fine) is incompatible eith current wireless keypads. Mule keypad does not work --- contacting wires from the opener operates the door, but the test code and programmed codes will not close the circuit."
4,Better than expected,"It is nice that you have the option of using this in a wired or wireless configuration. In my case, wireless was the only way to go.Like other 'programmable' wireless remotes, I expected a little pain in programming this one. The instructions have you press a certain key sequence and hold a working remote close to the unit until it beeps. The manual says it takes a little while. I must be impatient because I held it there for a good long time and it never beeped. But I tried it again and held the transmit button down for a very long time and sure enough, it finally beeped.Programming access codes is very easy, much easier than other keypad devices I've used.There is no delay in transmission, either. When I enter my code (I like the lighted button and beep feedback), my gate starts to open immediately.Mounting is trivial."
2,Painful For Guests To Use,"I constantly have to tell friends and relatives that they must press the buttons with, ""Fortitude and purpose."" It's a never-ending battle of guests not being able to enter. Eventually, they yank on the gate, causing the gate opener to be out of alignment.I feel like I'm babysitting. I have to watch the tiny blinking light to figure out if the code was enter in correctly. HINT: If you see a doubling blink at the end of your entry, then it worked!"
3,Might mule fm137,"This will not work with pre-2008 transmitters. I had to buy a new receiver that has a learn feature. The programming is great and you can set codes to expire in a few days. One down side is it only allows 4 digit codes, but I've found that if you tell people an extra digit they tend to be able to use it easier. The first button pressed turns it on so the opening code can then be entered, secondly the keys need to be pressed firmly. I'm using it wirelessly and have about 100 ft with direct line of sight and it works 80% of the time.I would buy another if they were less expensive just to eliminate the old square one that's still working but will wait until it dies."
3,"Wireless is nice, housing is cheap","I am using this with a MIghty Mule FM500 single gate opener. The wireless setup was easy and painless. I still have to follow the directions to get more codes in. I do like I can put a number of unique codes in, take them out, and even assign temporary ones. The keypad does light up red once you press a button. It does run off of batteries but I have not had to change them in 2 years and they are still going. It is for sure cost effective but I wish it had an intercom attached to it after having it for awhile.Pros:Wireless or WIred OptionEasy set upCons:Housing is cheapBattery powered"
4,Works great :),The keypad works great so far. I do wish it had a cover to protect the buttons. Not sure how they are going to hold up in the sun. Other than that I'm very happy with it.
1,"I tried, I give up","This is a great product when it works. But I have been through three of them. Each one quit working after a few days to a couple of weeks. Talked to customer service, they sent a new one each time, but after three faulty products I do not have the time or patience to keep trying until I get one that wont fail."
1,not happy with company,Got this item brand new packaging a far as I could tell fought to get it open Item would not work ANT online would not take it back so I had to send it back to manufacture at my expense this is the second time I got something from a amazon store and it didn't work
2,beware....,"The product did not learn my transmitter, and I called the maker (who was helpful) sent me another one, and it did not work."
5,mighty mule digital keypad,"this is a great addition to my entry gate, it works in conjunction with all of the mighty mule equipment i already had, it is well worth the money i paid for it."
4,the product was what I expected,Looks like the product will do what is expected. A Shame it moment connect hard wire for power. The on line manual shows it can be wired to power supply not what is sent. I could only find one type of these available on the manfully site. Would b 5 star is it could be wired for power.The seller was great. I received item fast and good price properly packed. Very pleased with seller.
1,keypad problems,"After wearing out my original keypad, it lasted maybe 8 years, I purchased a new one. The battery container in the new one warped in less than 6 months and keeps losing contact with the batteries. For almost $50 I expected it to last longer or at least be repairable. Now I'm faced with having to throw more money away to buy a new one that may not be any better."
3,range booster,"I installed this within 400' of the base and had terrible transmission, was unable to hear anyone at the unit. While looking for some sort of antenna boost or larger antenna I tried a 2' length of 8 gauge copper wire, coiled. Placing this on the existing antenna made it clear as day, working probably like it's intended."
1,Piece of Junk,"After hours of trying to program this piece of junk, I had a professional gate company give it a try and after an hour of trying they too gave up. They said that the unit would not hold a command. Save your money, don't fall for the company's advertisement."
2,Look Elsewhere,"I also purchased this product because of the easy to do instructions and believed it offered lots to do. I was wrong. There are very few patterns included with the kit and at that, some can be difficult to understand. Definitely, not worth the money."
3,Creative cooking...,"Book has some nice recipes but is a bit boring. If you cannot cook, do not buy this book! Purchase something a bit more simple. Received book from supplier in great condition and promptly."
1,I like wierd....but....,".....this just did not feel comfortable. The rubber strings felt,...well like rubber. I had to use baby powder to move up and down the strings. They were sticky and kept falling out of the grooves on the neck. I have heard some people really like this bass. I would suggest find it in a local shop and test it and go home and think about it then come back and test it again. I purchased it on line and got stuck with it because too much time went by, so I could not return it. When I traded it in I only got $75 for it. Good luck."
2,Way too predictable,"I read the cover and from what it said, I knew what the outcome of the book would be. The only reason I read it was because I wanted to know how the conclusion actually happened. You can read the first chapter, and from the lame story Ricky's ""wife"" gives, you can tell it's all fake. There are some interesting subplots in the book though. The book wasn't that bad, but you shouldn't read it if you're over 13 or 14."
3,What i thought of the book Pawns..........,"I read this book and it put me to bed, litarally. There are way too many things happening. Its Dull, Boring A Snooze~a~thon anyway you put it its BORING~!~"
4,Sabatier Precision 4-Piece Steak Knife Set--Great Buy,"This set of four Sabatier Precision steak knives fits in the same knife block that is included in the 7-piece set of Sabatier Precision knives. These knives are serrated, and while you could sharpen them with a special sharpener, you probably won't need to do so if you wash them by hand and don't leave them soaking in water. These knives have full tang construction so they are quite good. Since steak knives are used at table for the most part, one does not have to be concerned so much about their heft and feel in the hand.Steak knives are a kitchen essential, and this set is a great buy."
4,Handy Batch of basics,"This is a handy volume, very thorough and all-encompassing, hitting every aspect of technical theater production.The basics here are extremely basic. Particularly the construction sections seem geared to acting students who have never held a hammer or touched a nail. A semi-professional theater may find the book a bit too packed with unnecessary details, but for a school with a young program, this is an all-inclusive book that will provide everything that one could want to know in one handy resource.The book has a good helping of clear and appropriate illustrations; the explanations are well-aided by the pictures."
3,thick and comfy - a couple of small issues,"this cushion is very thick and very comfortable. Unfortunately, the velcro attachments have pulled away from the cushion. We've only used the cushion about 3 or 4 times before this happened."
5,Burnished mahogany jazz,"Freddy Cole can do not wrong. A consummate journeyman who is finally coming into his own as one of the top male jazz singers. He has the relaxed vocals of a Shirley Horn. His mahogany, life-worn voice embraces a lyric with emotion and, most importantly, space. He surrounds himself with top notch musicians and allows everyone room to breathe. He takes some chances on songs like Isn't She Lovely, and The Rose and pulls it off. He may be old school, but he does it oh so well. You cannot go wrong with any Freddy Cole release, all highly recommended."
4,A Bit Like the King,"Loved the piece ""Until It's Time To Go"" Reminded me of the King, Nat King Cole. Great phrasing and great piano."
1,R I P,Always seems to go on for ever and ever and... give it a rest. ... a long long rest. and let it Rest In Peace at the bottom of you pile of not-to-listen-to
1,Underwhelmed!,"This book has a lot of great catagories, but when it comes to actual phrases to use, they come up short. The phrases are very basic...I didn't need a book to come up with these. This book lacks detail, descriptive phrases and impact. I was looking for inspiration in writing my performance reviews - I did not find any inspiration or usuable phrases in this book!"
4,perfect phrasesfor performance reviews,as a new nurse manager writing performance reviews would have been extremely difficult without this book it helped tremendously
3,pleasantly surprised,"The watch is beautiful and the website really does not show it's true beauty. If you have a smaller wrist then you will need to have the watch ""re-sized"". It can be done. You will need to find a jeweler who has the right equipment to re-size the watch, but it can be done. I have a small wrist and I found a jeweler who can re-size the watch. Can't wait to get the watch back."
5,Great Service-Authentic Product,"I absolutely love my new watch. I wear it everyday to work....I even took it to the Movado Store in South Coast Plaza and the dealer says it's authentic. ""How much did you pay?"" I told her and she said you got a nice watch for a great price. But she also, said that I don't have a warranty.But it's okay for a $400.00 savings, I will take my chances."
5,This book truly has the spirit of Kahless within it!!,"Besides being part of the DS9 relaunch / 10th anniversary series, this book is also a must-read for anyone interested in Klingons. In fact, it's probably the most important Klingon story written to date. It had me singing songs of victory at the end (see TNG: Birthright or maybe DS9: Way of the Warrior)! I am truly sad to see it end, but hopefully there will be some more good books involving these characters on the way!"
2,pooly written,"I'm only 1/3 of the way through the book, but I'm finding the book to be rather poorly written. Lots of exposition on character history inserted in awkward places. For example, were in the middle of a Klingon mob uprising and suddenly were side tracked with a whole chapter dedicated to the life history of a totally new character, a Ferengi who just happened to get caught on the planet. Totally broke the flow of the story."
3,P.C. not Klingon,"I like the Klingons and I was hoping this one by Martok himself would be slammin. But what spioled it for me was the P.C. stuff to sooth hacked off female klin about the status of Klingon women on the show. They're a Warrior race, so get over it! Most of the charactures seemed right on especially Martok. But the characture of Martok's wife Shrilla was off. In the show, the klingon wife is not a warrior. Remember the ep ""House of Quark"", she gets kicked out or killed when her husband dies, unless she marries his killer. So I for one did not think this was true to the show. Also the villian and her son, I guess Klingon Warriors are just wipt by their women? (NOT!) Klingon Warriors are a mix between Bikers and Vikings, not hen-pecked wimps! So all in all I would not say it's a real KLINGON story. ""Kayless"" was better. I am not interested in the second parter."
2,Lense placement,"I bought three similar styles to try out so I could find the easiest, most comfortable and best performing. This one was second best of the three. It works ok but is a little awkward to use. It is however, the easiest to squeeze. The ease to squeeze was the plus but the awkwardness takes that plus away. The price, like the performance, was also in the middle of the three but the shipping charge is more then 5 times more then that of one of the others and almost 2 times more then that of the third one. Shipping and handling cost alone on an item that weighs a few ounces is enough to stop me from ever purchasing this one again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, never going to happen."
5,Folding Garage work bench,This is exactly what I was looking for to add a workbench in my garage without giving up space. When I need the bench it is simple to lift up. When I dont need it the brackets fold down easily. Seems to be a very durable product.
5,Very satisfied,These brackets are very strong and built to last. Very easy to adjust to upright or down position.
5,Excellent multi-purpose knife,"This is an excellent quality, beautiful knife. I have used this type of knife for years, and find that I use it every time I cook. I replaced a less expensive one with this, and I am very pleased with the quality. Invest some [money] in the knife that you use most often; this one is worth the cost. A Chinese chef knife is not just for Asian cooking. Try it and you will be hooked."
2,sabatier provence santuko knife,"The knife is a great tool for the kitchen, cuts and chops very well. Problem I experienced is, the knife broke at the bolster when attempting to cut thru a chicken breast bone. To date I have not been able to get warranty information from Sabatier as to replacement. Knife was approx. 6 months old. Barb"
4,Mostly satisfied,This product is well made. I appreciate the fact these have full surface magnets on each block letter. The only down fall is the amount of lesser used letters. There are more than enough I's. Our last name and our daughter's first name have two y's in them and we are unable to spell them with one set of these letters. Other than that I am extremely satisfied with this product. They are holding up to our 16 month old and that says a lot in itself.
1,Poor Quality of Magnets,We loved the look of these blocks however the magnets fell off over 75% of the blocks after a short period of time. We were so disappointed in quality that we will not buy from this supplier again.
1,Not worth the price!,"We bought these for our 2yo son and at first they were okay. Not as good of quality as expected but not to bad either. Within a week the magnets glued on the back started to fall off. No, my son didn't pull any off. Every once in a while there would be a small ""clunk"" in the kitchen as another one just dropped off the fridge, leaving the magnet still attached to the fridge. Now about half of the letters are sitting atop the fridge waiting to be either thrown out or glued back together. This is really annoying and makes the toys pretty junky. Also, the magnets alone could be easily swallowed or choked on by a younger child and this makes them very dangerous. I would not buy again and am very disappointed with this toy. I am going to see if they will refund the toy or not."
1,"Nice to have, but not durable","I bought this product for a Christmas gift. We hung the magnets on my refrigerator and immediately they started falling off the fridge. By the end of the evening, just about every magnet was laying on the floor! Just a heads up in case you decide to buy this product."
1,Glue is weak and letters fall off the magnets,"We bought these at a local bookstore, and you would think that it's a pretty straightforward toy that would be fun for a child, except that after about 6 months, nearly all the letters have come unstuck from the magnets, so now we just have a bunch of magnet squares and a bunch of wood letter blocks."
5,Just Perfect!,"This 12-ring holder was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It holds all sizes...from wide to very thin. It's slender size makes it easy to tuck into a drawer or to travel with. Also, it was delivered within two days and packed extremely well."
4,Men's ring box,"Nice little case, and reasonably well made, with metal hinges. Great for mens' rings, since the slots are wide."
4,Good Value,"For the money, a very good value. Yes its made in China, no its not leather, but the lid closes squarely and tall rings fit well. It has a lock, but only provides minimum security. You can find better boxes for $30 and up, but this works for me."
5,Just what I needed,I was looking for something to organize / store my growing collection of rings and this fit the bill exactly. It's compact so it fits into a drawer and latches securely. The slots hold rings of different widths & thicknesses. Very nice!
3,Wide slot jewelry RING case,"Hmmm, this ring case is rather cheap and tacky. BUT, it wasn't very expensive and will work well for me. I only needed it to be able to bring rings with me on trips, so it is actually perfect. I'd not have paid more than I did for it for sure. There is nothing really wrong with the workmanship, but the vinyl wrap around a cheap box just tends to look a bit cheap. Packed in a Priority USPS box with a few peanuts...not super great, but got to me in fine condition. Great for the money overall. Fast ship. Dana"
4,nice gift,This book makes a nice gift for a cat lover....it has nice pictures with inspirational quotes.
4,Excellent protection against a fall.,"I bought the Safe Hip Protector for my 89 year old Mom, and it was a hit! It's comfortable and not very noticeable. It was hard at first but once it's broken in with wear and wash, it's fine. She has fallen a few times, and she's been ok. Make sure to get the type with the protectors built-in; the type with protectors to be inserted becomes too bulky. I definitely recommend it!"
2,Coulda been a contender...,"I purchased a T-Mobile stripe and was, at first, quite pleased. The ergonomics are decent - definitely better than my 1st generation RAZR (ugh!), despite the rather small screen size. I like the slim profile and smoothed edges. The camera performs well enough for a phone - some day soon the phones will actually have good cameras. Sound quality is acceptable. BUT... and this is a big ol Hurley sized but... the Bluetooth is crippled so that it only permits interaction with headsets. I could not interface with my laptop or my other phone via Bluetooth. It appears that T-Mobile has disabled these aspects of Bluetooth to force me to use their web based $ervice$ to extract photos from my phone or obtain ringtones or wallpapers. I sure wish T-Mobile had been a little more precise in their features description so I didn't have to go through the hassle of returning this otherwise fine phone."
2,Grade S for satisfactory,"Samsung Stripe t329 myFaves Phone (T-Mobile)Good Things: The phone is unbelievably light. Easy to useBad Things: 1)Is it Bluetooth compatible? the sales rep said it was, but I can't get mine to work.2)It rings even while on silent mode, it a very LOW ring, but it woke me up 3)The lock application takes too many steps to lock/unlock also there's no one button shortcut. 4)The camera is very low quality.4)The speaker phone is LOW and you cannot close the phone while using it.I just switched to T-mobile because of their 1000 minute promotion, however I may be switching back to my old service. I'm not satisfied with my free phone (it was supposed to be $30) or the reception."
1,Duped,"Bought this set for my son from a local retailer and we ended up losing half of it at an SCCA event earlier in the season. Looked everywhere for the set again and could find it nowhere. was thrilled when I found it on amazon and promptly ordered it. what arrived was not the set I had been shown, but what looks like a cross between recent asian concept cars and space shuttles. in fact, the box evidenced a ""galaxy"" theme. My son and I were both largely disappointed and he has yet to take them out of the box. They've been shoved back in his closet behind old shoe boxes and a single brown recluse. Don't be fooled.The fine print at the bottom of the page reads,""From the manufacturer: Please note that car types may vary."" No joke.Don't waste your money. You'll get discontinued cars that no one wants."
1,JUNK,"I ordered 2 sets, both sets were different than the cars pictured, the sets I recieved have vehicles that are mostly plastic, not durable. I'm not impressed."
1,Disappointed,"I had not noticed the fine print saying ""cars may vary"". Had I read that, I would not have ordered this set. My boys are very specific about the type of cars they like. The set we got had ugly pictures of a mummy, dracula, frankenstein, ghosts & skeletons. I would say this ""switcharoo"" borders on false advertising since the cars that were pictured were perfect for my 4 and 5 year old sons but the cars I received are only fit for my trash can."
2,Good Reader,"This is a good, short read. I would recommend it to readers of all ages and stages of life."
2,To starchy,I'm used to making my own spaetzle and found this to be to heavy and starchy. Most likely will not buy again
2,"Same Old Stuff, Different Title","Helen Bianchin only has one story to tell - and she's told it fifty times!If you've read any of her other stories, you've read this one.And as usual, I find it hard to care about the characters in her book.The hero is always perfect, to the point that he can even mind read the heroine. He's always stinking rich and orders everyone about and has people jumping to his command at any moment. In real life, he would be impossible to live with.The heroine always sounds like someone from a fairy tale - incredibly beautiful, kind, loving, caring...They always dine at exquisite resaurants, drinking superb wines while socialising with the most elite and famous.Their lives are so perfect, I really don't care about their troubles."
4,UCG book in research and teaching,"I had waited a long time for a book that could serve me as ""manual pages"" for different operating systems.Best part of this book is that if you are familiar with one OS you can now find the similar command in another OS. Afterall, when learning commands of a new OS the most difficult part (atleast for myself) was to ask the right questions - what can you do in this OS? I've used the book to find right commands for optimizing my Linux environment for heavy Matlab use and the book has served it's purpose well.Because of good indexing of the book I feel that it is also good material for university students, especially for Operating systems courses.There is one bad thing about the book, though. It is extremely big and heavy - and will probably ruin your bookbag ;D"
2,Not worth the money,"This book portends to be a universal command guide, and in all fairness they managed to get a good number of commands in the text. Unfortunately the ones the missed are significant (e.g. UNIX tar, which is universal in UNIX and Linux). I would not recommend this book for someone looking for help in distinguishing the difference in Linux and BSD commands."
2,ERNEST MOOD PUZZLE,"DUABLE WOOD PUZZLE, GREAT CONCEPT FOR EXPRESSING DIFFERENT MOODS - JUST A LOT SMALLER THAN I ANTICIPATED IT WOULD BE."
1,Piece of junk,This product is a piece of junk. It is real flimsy and is really no better then a piece of aluminum foil.
3,"Good lens, but slow focus","Very good lens for the price...good Bokeh....very sharp, but at least on my cameras (a100 and a37) with low light sometimes it is very slow on focusing.But....if you're new to photography, and don't want to spend a lot of cash, this is one lens that you must have."
4,"Uplifting, excellent music","This cd takes christian music to another level. From the first song Sunrise, it is true praise and worship, and I'm so pleased I bought this cd.Everyone should own this cd. I play it in my car on the way to work, to lift me up first thing.Be blessed!"
4,Makes Me Wanna Shout!!!,"I love this CD, it is powerful praise and worship. Being a worship leader it is one project that truly brings you into the power and presence of the Lord. Expecially, ""When I Think About The Lord"". It truly does, ""Make Me Wanna Shout!!! Hallelujah!!!!"
1,These do not work they are a hoax.,"All they are is a metal plate with a resistor attached, this doesn't dissipate the charge like a wired one does. I test this in my lab and was able to load a charge on my body that did not dissipate."
1,This product IS A SCAM!!!!,"I opened this product up and there is not circuitry of any kind!!! This product is a SCAM, I got static shocks several times and the plastic enclosure is just that... PLASTIC with nothing inside of it!!! Amazon should remove this from their website IMMEDIATELY!"
5,"Believe it or not, it actually works.","I purchased this product at the same time that I purchased a device that detects a static charge. If I shuffle my feet on the carpet while wearing my slippers, the device shows I am building up a charge. Normally that charge would remain until I touch something and discharge instantly. But when I wear this cordless anti-static wrist strap, I would still build up a (smaller) charge, but it would dissipate fairly quickly.While a standard corded strap will prevent a charge from ever building up, it hampers your movement and since it's a path to ground, can even be dangerous. This cordless strap allows complete freedom of movement so you can leave your work area without needing to unclamp/unstrap yourself and without losing your anti-static protection. Best of all, there is no path to ground, so if you touch the wrong thing, you're less likely to get shocked."
2,Not worth it!,"I have faithfully upgraded from each version of MS Money since v1 on Windows 3.0. I have been pleased up until now. The functionality is wonderful, but what really annoys me is that it is almost impossible to make this a stand alone version - without being directed to web sites and preferred financial partners. I don't seem be able to turn off the login screen that starts each time - I can bypass logging in, but not get rid of the option altogether.The 2 year subscription you get (forcing you to upgrade to MS Money 2007 no doubt) is very, very unwelcome. Bill Gates just seems to be gouging us with this release."
2,Not Happy with Microsoft Money 2005 - Want my money back,"We purchased Microsoft Money program the beginning of January 2005 in the hopes of having our ""finacial"" bookkeeping handled quickly, efficiently, and easily by this program. Now, almost a month later, we are ready to unload the program and never use it again. We have found this program to be very user ""unfriendly"". We have not been able to set up a passport, we cannot connect directly to our bank via it's online website, most things we have learned have been through trial and error as the program offers next to no information on their tutorials. This whole experience has turned into nothing but frustration. Has anyone else gone to ""Quicken"" and had any better luck? Let me know b/f I waste my money on yet another unsatisfactory program.P.S. How do I get my money back?"
1,Use only if you want M$ to know how much money you have,"Have you tried to go to moneycentral.msn.com?You have all your account information available online. I don't remember letting M$ to put this information to there database. Worst of all I've been searching through the menus and I still cannot figure out how to disable this option.I've had Money '99, Money '03. Money '03 had this annoying Passport login every time you use Money. When their service broke I couldn't use Money for a week. It just didn't let me to get to my own file with my own password!Now after upgrading from '03 it created duplicates of all accounts I set up for online before and it still fails to update account data from the financial institution. Whenever you try to fix a problem it creates some bogus account (like Yourbank Banking). It's a nightmare!It's worst M$ product I've ever seen."
1,Don't upgrade unless you know what you are doing.,"Money 2005 appears to have come from another planet. It does not automatically upgrade an existing version of Money (2004 in my case). Worse, if I remove an earlier version of Money after installing Money 2005, all file associations (OFX, QIF) are gone, which renders Web downloaded statements unusable. And the alien life part does not stop there. To reestablish file associations, I had to reinstall Money 2005. Surprise, surprise, it installs itself all over again, without knowing there is already a copy on the disk."
3,Why can't I change Category Groups?,"I'm a single woman with two dogs. I spend quite a bit on their food, vet bills, walkers, etc. There is no category group for pets. I could put them in the ""other expenses"" category group, but I found this category group wall taking up about 30% of my total spending because I also have to shove so many other areas of my life into it.I can't delete alimony as a category group. I don't pay alimony or receive it, so it's a totally wasted category group. I now use it to record all gifts. But I cant't change its name... I just have to remember that alimoney = gifts.The pet expenses? Now I record them under ""childcare."" It makes me feel a little pathetic - like those women in commercials who put on romantic music and light candles to feed their cat out of a crystal bowl. But, until Money gets its act together, that's what I'm stuck with."
1,Do not upgrade!,"I am a MS Money fan so was quick to get the 05 version. Well I am uninstalling and rolling back to last years version!First there is a new Internet Services Policy you must agree to. It starts out with ""Microsoft Money 2005 includes up to two (2) years of Internet-based Services. You will be able to use the Internet-based Services in Microsoft Money 2005 for a period of two (2) years from installation of the product or until September 1, 2007, whichever is earlier.""**** In two years you can not perform online banking!!!Second the little Money Express program that reminds you of upcoming bills is gone.I have 3 words for this program - Do Not Upgrade!Stay With Your Current Version"
2,Stick w/ 2004,"I've had 2005 on the shelf for a while and finally upgraded from 2004. I've been happy w/ every upgrade since 2001, until now. First, it doesn't upgrade the 2004 installation, it installs separately. In the end, this turns out to be the best feature of 2005, because when you inevitably uninstall 2005, you don't have to reinstall 2004!The most annoying items for me were:1. The toolbars at the top take too much space due to an internet navigation toolbar that cannot be turned off. Every other MS product has fully customizable toolbars, what happened here!2. In many cases, when clicking on something to get to some aspect of your financial info, you are first taken to an MSN MoneyCentral website, which is very intrusive!3. There is a more complex and nested arrangement of menus for features which makes it harder to find and get to stuff.I didn't use it much beyond that. #2 was really hard to accept."
1,"Truly Terrible ""Upgrade""","I'm not sure it gets much worse than this, I should have stuck with 2004. When it ""converted"" my 2004 Money file none of the totals were right. It didn't carry over the starting balances listed in the account settings for each of the accounts, it took me days to figure out that is what the problem was. Occasionally this will happen again when it has trouble connecting to the online services at your bank, it just wipes everything out and starts all over.Had I known it was going to be this bad I would have never touched it."
2,MS Money,This item worked and was used for several years. It is no longer available. I now use Quicken and like it much better.
2,Disappointed,I found this product exasperating with it's connection to net. passport. I only wanted back track some bank statements to find a entry but was constantly going in circles with MS Money and Net. Pasport. I gave up.
1,"Bad move Microsoft, I bet you loose a lot of customers...","I too have been a Money user for many years. I actually started with Quicken and really liked it but switched to Money because my bank at the time didn't support Quicken for on-line banking.I have been using Money now for about 6 years and learned to like it a lot. So it was a no-brainer to upgrade when the 2005 version was released. Did I say no-brainer? That turned out to be appropriate because my impression was anyone with brains would avoid this upgrade!This was a down-grade! Many features I'd grown used to (like Money Express) were gone! It's internet update REQUIRED you register through a .NET passport and was very slow compared to previous versions.I will continue to use 2004 and wait to see what the 2006 version has. If it's more of the same non-sense, I'll switch to Quicken!"
1,Not an upgrade!,"I was happily using the old Money 98 program, and thought it was time to upgrade. One of the best features, the ""cash flow chart,"" that would predict your account balances over time, was removed from the ""standard"" program and is now available only in the ""deluxe"" version. I found this out after several hours of trying to figure out ""where it went"" and many calls/emails to customer service (useless!). My only choice was to uninstall it and return it and wait for Deluxe to be released. Now I'm concerned, because Deluxe has been listed as having many problems..."
3,New User,I have ordered the product but I havent received it yet. Ive been reading all the reviews and I dont know what to think yet. I have noticed almost everyone are past users. Im hoping this will be a friendly product for a new user. My two primary questions are Do you have to sign up for the 2 year service and will money 05 be compatible soon for a pda. Any input would be great. Thanks.
4,"Works well, but ...","It works exactly as it's supposed to. The reason for only 4 stars is because I find that the old style where the release is on the side is much easier than on top like with this model. But unfortunately, I can't find the side release models anymore."
5,easy and ajustable,"Those who say it cannot close totally, or you need to put a spring in between, or it needs to open a minimum of 1"" did not totally get it.The level of the top hat can be adjusted by putting the bolt on the correct height on the thread. This being said, works perfect."
1,VERY Slow Refund!,"This product was extremely average in quality. Returned for a refund, and then the Seller took 2 weeks to issue me a refund. Too slow!"
2,Just okay,"I ordered these mushrooms with great anticipation since I really love mushrooms. Now I wish I had tried them before ordering a whole case. There's nothing really wrong with the mushrooms and other vegetables in here, but there's nothing special about them either. It's not a very good combination of ingredients, and I would prefer mixing a can of mushrooms with a jar of pickled vegetables."
1,POOR PACKAGING,"ITEM NEEDS TO BE PUT IN A LARGER BOX WITH ADEQUATE PACKING MATERIALS, INSTEAD OF STUCK IN A FLAT BOX AND TAPED!"
5,One of Bette's Best,"If you ever want to make someone understand why Bette Davis was the star she was, you have only to plop them down and have them watch this! As Julie Marsden, a headstrong,willful Southern Belle (is there any other kind?LOL)she upsets convention,indeed flouts it,in her way of doing things in her sphere,1852 New Orleans,where women had a place and,for the most part.stayed there. No so,Julie! From her entrance (a STAR entrance is there ever was one)Bette makes it clear and indelible,just who her character is and what drives her. She's always watchable and that holds true here.The transfer of this dvd sparkles and Davis never looked better. The special featuresJezebel (Restored and Remastered Edition)s are great and informative as well.SEE IT!"
5,Redeemed by Yellow Jack,"This is an excellent film bolstered by superlative production values and above all an exceptional cast. However, make no mistake that this is Bette Davis' film all the way. Bette Davis is the complex Julie Morrison, the self-destructive Southern belle. The story takes place in pre-Civil War upper class New Orleans where gentlemen defended the honor of a lady's name over pistols. Bette Davis brilliantly flaunts these conventions in wicked fashion for mere amusement even though she realizes the abyss she is spiraling herself into. Henry Fonda is good as the very stoic and unbending Preston Dillard. He is the one man whom Davis will ultimately frustrate as he eventually refuses to be maneuvered as one of her pawns. William Wyler directed this film in grand fashion with cinematography by Ernest Haller, art designs by Robert Haas and a good score Max Steiner."
4,Southern Drama,"Until Gone With The Wind was produced one year later, this film was the premiere motion picture on the antebellum South. Strong-headed and willful, Julie Martin (Davis) wears a red dress to the Olympus Ball (virginal white is what unmarried girls are supposed to wear), scandalizes New Orleans society and loses her engagement to Preston Dillard (Fonda). The next time she sees him, she is in white and on her knees apologizing. Excellent movie, with real-life historical events thrown in, and a dramatic climax and conclusion. Too bad it could not be in color."
2,Bette Davis: Poor Imitation of a southern belle,"After viewing this movie, it only made me realize why Vivian Leigh was the only actress who could have played Scarlett O'Hara in 'Gone With The Wind."" ""Jezebel"" is like watching the poor man's 'Gone With The Wind."" That Bette Davis actually won an Academy Award for her portrayal of ""Julie"" is astounding. Not only that, the audacity of thinking she could have ever fit the role of ""Scarlett O'Hara."" Bette Davis was a powerful actress in her own right. But playing a southern belle was just one ""bitch"" role that just didn't suit her."
2,THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I finally got the chance to see this so-called great Bette Davis flick, I could'nt believe how disappointed I was. The beginning of the story was wonderful, Bette playing the wicked southern belle. There were a few good scenes and bam! The movie was over! I was like where is the rest of the story??? I felt truly short changed and I wanted more Bette! Of all the Oscar caliber Bette Davis performances The Letter,Deception,All About Eve, The Old Maid, and Now Voyager, she wins the Academy Award for this dud!"
4,Deep Drama In The Deep South,"A wonderful sad story for a night with a friend. I doubt a boyfriend would watch it with you, but it is a grand movie. I LOVED IT!"
4,love old movies,"I love all old movies, I have been teaching school for the last 39 years, I am the oldest of my school but the youngest in spirit, energyMy favorite moments are the time spent watching all my old movies.I am trying to get as many as I can, I do have quite a collection, of new old, drama, comedies, musicals, westerns, etcThere are still some movies that I can't get yet because they haven't been realised yet. But I am still hoping. Exanple The Blue Veil with Jane Wyman a 1951 movie.A Certain Smile, with Joan Fontaine, ( in this movie Johnny Mattis sings a Certain Smile. I could mention so many that I would like to have.Thanks Ellen Doucet Perreault"
3,Well Named!,"I didn`t like this film. I`m not sure why because I really enjoyed it years ago when I saw it for the first time. Maybe because the character played by Bette Davis is so awful and Henry Fonda is such a wishy washy hero. He wasn`t a charismatic actor and in this seems to plod more than usual.Bette Davis was so good at being horrible that I shouldn`t be fed up with her in this film. But I am. She is maliputive, rude, spiteful and just plain awful.No doubt she deserved her Oscar since she managed to put me off side so completely. Perhaps I`m the problem. I`m getting old and crabby.Plenty happens in the story so if I haven`t put you off, enjoy it and say how wrong I am."
5,A wonderful film!,"""Jezebel"" is a really great classic film. I highly recommend it . Bette Davis is wonderful in her role, so is HenryFonda, her lover in the film. This film has some of the best acting in it I've ever seen. I'd give it more stars if I could.I'm a big fan of Bette Davis' , and in this film, as in all her others, she always gave her absolute best performance."
5,Must See,"If you loved Gone with the Wind, you will love this Bette Davis classic! Henry Fonda was wonderful as well. This is one of my top 10 movies."
3,How did this end?,"I would probably recommend this movie to a classic movie fan, but not your typical movie watcher. I thought Henry Fonda did a splendid job on his portrayal of Preston; he brought dignity and sense to his character. Bette Davis did a pretty good job as Julie. I just felt that the character of Julie lacked much reason. There were a few unreasonable things in this film, but overall, I enjoyed it. The only absolutely ridiculous thing of this movie was the ending! It made me feel there should be at least 30 minutes more of film and that there was practically no closure to be had whatsoever! The plot was fairly decent until this unfortunate end."
4,Jezebel Review,It was a little expensive for the product but shipping was cheap and swift so I was pleased overall with the expierience.
3,"Terrific performance, pointless and annoying story","The lead character is so very manipulative and knee-jerk reactionary that it's a wonder anyone fellow story charadctput up with her. Her love for her fiance played by a very wooden Henry Fonda seems non-existant, and when he leaves her after an impossible humiliating stunt of hers, she suddenly can't live without him. The story is drawing-room dull, all manners and behaviors. None of the characters are interesting enough to give a rat for. The dramatic ending is inconsequential and improbable."
5,Fastenating collection of Ghost and Monster stories found in rural Oregon,This book had us on the edge of our chairs as we read page after page of spell bound local ghost stories. This writer keeps you in his spell as you go through the stories wondering if this is true of just a tale. Try it out and see if you are a believer too.
3,"Good read, sparse on Portland area information","Oregon's Ghosts and Monsters is full of interesting details of the paranormal in Oregon. Readers who are interested in ghost lore involving the state's largest population center--Portland--would be advised to look elsewhere. There is no mention of any ghosts or monsters who dwell in the City of Roses or surrounding areas, which seems like a major omission. I'm sure such a city has it's fair share of ghosts; one only has to think of the many unsuspecting drunks who were sometimes killed in the process of being taken captive in the Shanghai Tunnels beneath Old Town. In sum: a good sumation of those spectres that haunt more rural locales, but urban ghosts are ignored."
3,"Well Made, but only Fair Performance","Quality construction, thick blade is rigid, but does not slice as well as the Henckels and Wusthof."
3,Call me Fuzzy,"Makes great rice when it finally starts cooking. Real confusing instructions cause long delay before cooking begins. I still can't figure out how to use all the buttons! When first plugged in, none of them respond. Fuzzy logic indeed!"
4,Good product,"I love the timer function - super convenient. It's a good size too - doesn't take up too much counter space, and it's not an eye-sore either. The very first time I used it, though, the rice kind of had a chemically taste, so we just tossed it. I've used it several more times and it hasn't had that taste since... so I would recommend making a test/practice serving. This is the first rice cooker I've had, and I'm very happy with it (look forward to trying the steam function!)."
4,Very handy appliance,"This product does what I want it to do. My last rice cooker was a cheap $25 model that I rarely used because I wasn't satisfied with the rice it made. I was a little surprised by the price of this Panasonic model, but I'm very satisfied with it. I've been using it about once or twice a week since my purchase two months ago.I've not been too adventuresome--just regular white rice or brown rice--but it does a very good job. I'm especially pleased with the heater (keeps rice warm for hours), the timer, and how easy clean-up is.If there's a negative, it's the user manual. I own a number of Panasonic appliances, and they all have lousy manuals. Fortunately, most of the commands are intuitive."
5,Excellent Learning and future reference,"I found I was unable to get anywhere with the SDK docs. This book pointed out several errors in the SDK docs as well as a few I was creating. Another thing about this book that differs from the MS SDK, The sample code actually works!!! When a book says something it should be responsable for its content. This book is. Additionally, I liked the .NET sidebars. When is the .NET version of this book comming out?!? I will buy that one too.One other thing that was key in this book, you can use it as a cover to cover read or a straight reference. A short history of computer graphics is included in ch1. I found this made other things make sense. Maybe other people knew this stuff but I didn't really understand it before this book.Al."
1,Not Very Good!,"Don't waste your money, you should look at the book by Crooks instead. It includes complete samples and also shows you how to use other tools for 3D modelling, etc."
2,Don't Buy This Book,"I just finished this book and not sure if I learned anything that wasn't already in the SDK documentation. I understand that writing a book would be hard, but it seems that they almost copied the information. There is another VB book that deals with DirectX by Crooks [...] that is very good as it helps you to build a complete game including all the 3D models, sound effects and other misc. items. You should buy that book instead -- Just MHO!!!![....]"
1,BEWARE! This is NOT VB.NET!!! It is Visual Basic 6!!,"I just want to warn anyone intersted in this book that this is a book about visual basic 6 and not VB.NET. It seems like the site has now been updated but my invoice, order confirmation, and cached pages all display it as VB.NET. Now that I have it in my hand I can see that this is not the case. There is a section at the back of the book that talks about VB.NET a little bit but all the code in the book is VB6. Don't get burned."
1,Do not buy this book,I was looking in the directX help file and noticed that the lessons in this book are copied from the SDK's help file with the names of the variables changed. Imagine how mad I am to realize I just paid $50 for samples I already had. Isn't this against the law?
1,one star is too many,"This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made. It goes to show that you shouldn't buy a book based on a table of contents alone. The author's code is weak at best. He explains 1/4 of the primitive code he writes and then throws in variables with no acknowledgement. In his discussion of directPlay he fails to mention the need to implement any interfaces. I've been teaching the database side of app developement for years, and if I can read a book and still be no better for it, it stinks."
2,Not for Serious Developers,"This book is lacking for more descriptive code examples. Let's face it,most of us learn from step by step examples, and this is where the book lacks. Theory seems to be lacking also. After going through the book I was not able to write a 3D graphics program without copying the authors code line for line (by the way they did not work either). It talks about general theory but is severely lacking on the details of what each line of code does. Therefore leaving the reader not understanding the core concepts so closing the book and writing a 3D program is not possible."
1,"Covers the SDK, but assumes you've worked with DirectX","The book does cover DirectX, but the examples don't include any explanations or overviews. It simply states the methods and how to declare them, it doesn't tell you WHY you use them, or when you would want to use them. Reads more like a reference than a learning tool."
4,"Easy install, great lighting","We ordered this light to install under the cabinets for counter task lighting. I installed it in about 30 minutes (would have been sooner with fewer interruptions from 3 kids and the phone!) It installed fairly easily, looks great, and works perfectly for what I needed. The tiny nuts that hold the inside of the fixture together were difficult to put on when the light was sitting on the counter and were nearly impossible to assemble upside down under the cabinet. I give 4 stars because it would be easier to install with a little different placement and style of nut. Otherwise, it is a great light, looks nice, and gives exactly the kind of light that I was looking for."
4,nice bracelet,Nice bracelet to wear with other braclets or a simple one bracelet look. Bendable and twists easily to put on. It is comfortable.
5,Excellent band and excellent album!!,It is a pleasure to review an album from such a great and different band!! Their sound is so particular and unique!!I love this album and I can not stop listening to it!!If you are the kind of people who likes to explore and listen to new and different musical styles this album is for you!
2,"very bad, forgettable music","aimless metallic/neoclassical postmodern appropriation with slap bass and physically painful operatic flourishes. something like therion meets mr. bungle meets primus. take a look at all the positive reviews for this album and keep an eye out for key adjectives: ""bizarre"", ""unique"", ""weird,"" etc.; artists like this have no personality beyond their objective to be ""avant-garde""--something even the band name suggests--which makes even the dimmest listeners realize how reactionary and dated their music is a few years down the line. unfortunately this is usually after they review it as ""BRILLIANT!!!"" on amazon.mr. bungle and arcturus did this sort of thing better, sigh still does it better. ""different"" =/= brilliant. ignore."
3,Nothing more or less than I expected,"I came into the Watchers 4 having seen the first 3. My expectation with watchers 4 was that it would suffer sequelitus, but still leave me glad I rented it. My paradigm wasn't effected like watching the first 3. That said, it was more of watchers to the point that I was still interested to hear and learn the material. If you haven't seen the rest of the series, or are the type who never watch the extras on a dvd, then this might not be for you. I am glad I rented and watched it, as well as glad I didn't pay to purchase it."
2,Disappointed,"As some of the other reviews have stated, this book is not a bad place to start, but it comes up well short of delivering on its promises. The highlights on the front cover of the book state that ""advanced reporting concepts"" are covered. I disagree. This book barely covers the basics. On page 239 the author briefly mentions Functional Areas without Logical Databases, but then claims that ""advanced ABAP programming skills are required for this type of functional area creation."" I have no ABAP programming experience but frequently use this method for my queries. If you have basic knowledge of the tables that contain your data its not that difficult. This is the true power of queries. A reasonably experienced user can meet his or her own reporting needs.If you're just getting started with queries this book will give you the basics, but you'll need to find other sources (or teach yourself) to really take advantage of their potential."
3,Not Bad for Beginers,"This book is good to start with. However it spends too much space in getting people familiar with the SAP theory and does not do much for SAP practice. You learn how to build a query, which is not a report but a bunch of data. I left with the impression that if I want to build a report I have one of the tree options; Call a programmer Output the data into an external database (i.e. Access) Buy another software. Hope this is not true. Again getting familiar with concepts like functional areas and functional groups is important."
2,Expected more than I get,"I have expected more from this book. I was especially interested in HR section (ABAP query for this module is slightly different than for others), but there was nothing more than just basic staff. If you don't know anything or very little about ABAP query you can buy it. There is just little bit about reporting tree, how to create, change, etc it, nothing about interesting reports you may use. Few paragraphs are just for SAP beginners and few about staff like creating form letters in Word or about add-ons reporting tools like ARGUS. I think that just half of this book is useful somehow - this is a part about ABAP query."
4,"Really good book, teaches you everything in a simple way","Hi, we tried to register for classes at SAP for the ABAP Query and we were told there were none. We bought 2 copies of the book and have properly setup the tool and are writing our own reports. It was very well written with good examples for both business readers and programmers (for the more advanced stuff). Would recommend A++"
3,Teakettle OK,"Teakettle is OK, I would have prefered no plastic on it. The angle of the spout causes water to spit out when water comes to a boil and the wistle top is removed when the kettle is filled completely. One of the reasons I replaced my old one. For the price and brand I would have expected a bit more."
3,Item not as pictured,"This is a very nice little tea pot, but I was dissapointed to find out that it was not like pictured. Other colors of this model show a pop-out whistler, but the black clearly shows a whistler that lifts with a lever. What I recieved was one with a pop-out whistler, which isn't really what I wanted.The teapot works well, cleans up nicely, and has a nice whistle. The quality is good, and it heats water quickly. If it was what was pictured I'd give it 4 stars."
5,A must have!!,You will not go wrong with this teapot. It brews the perfect pot of tea and the tea included is the best!! Best teapot I have ever owned!!
2,Not made in France. . .,"Not worth the price. Amazon, country where made would be quite helpful with some of these items."
1,piece of metal,"looks good. But is not very functional. Theres no central compartment to place tea leaves if you dont want to use tea bags.Also, the lid is very tight. So pulling it out is scary."
4,"A good looking, working tea kettle","What is there to say about a tea kettle? it handles the tea making just fine. The design is overall appealing, especially since I have matching teacups from another company. Like another review said, this comes with a removable whistle over the spout, not the lever.Cons: Besides the lack of the lever from the picture, the whistle is not very loud at first, so take that as a pro or con as you see fit.Also, the whistle is not going to work unless you completely close the top of the lid, and properly secure the whistle to the spout. Otherwise the steam just flows out random openings and does nothing.Only other downside is that the top of the kettle is kind of hard to remove, especially if you can only grip the little black nob due to heat.Overall, a working, good looking, teakettle, but I bought this for about half price. I wouldn't suggest it for its normal price though. If your going to spend over fifty dollers for a kettle, make sure its one you want."
1,Very disappointed with whistler pot,"Although this item is visually beautiful, the functionality is disappointing. The pop-out spout cover is annoying when removing it while hot. The lid is not easy to remove when hot and you have to push it down hard to close. The spout cover is easlly misplaced. Fortunately the Creuset people replaced it free. BUT the 5th time I used it the whistler did not work ( melted plastic) and the pot boiled away the water and I am not sure if it safe to boil water in it anymore. I bought it for safety reasons and for the whistle and it is a big disappointment- considering the makers name and reputation. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Perfect for anyone starting out.,This book is a great how to book. Lots of tips and tricks on using Polymer clay well illustrated and walks you through every aspect of creating a figure. Perfect for anyone starting out or those who want to learn some new tricks.
5,lifelike,"Love thees books. Very helpful, step by step instructions. Quick hassel free purchase. reasonably priced compared to in the store pricing. Thank you"
5,exelente,"un libro exelente tanto para los que quieren aprender a modelar figuras, como para los que necesitan un libro de referencia a la hora de ponerse a trabajar. lo recomiendo."
5,Creating Life-Like Figures in Polymer Clay:A Step-By-Step Guide,"This is one of the most comprehensive books on sculpting that I've ever seen. Generous step-by-step, clear photographs make it easy to begin or improve sculpting. I highly recommend this book to beginners or advanced clay enthusiasts."
1,Waste of money...do not buy,"Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the dried dill, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Absolutely No Smell No Taste,"Not even sure if this is really Dill Weed????? These look like crushed mint leaves or just plain crushed leaves, dill weed looks feathery and the smell and taste is VERY distinct. This item is NOT. Don't waste your money. I think if someone were to have left dill weed out open subjected to the elements for 10 years, that would have more aroma and taste than this product does. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY"
3,adidas water shoe,"A pretty good product. Great for the water, not so great if you are doing much walking around outside of the water. The beaches are rocky here in New England, so they were a big help. However they trapped sand, and since my family bikes and walks and camps, I won't use them as much as I would have liked. They were on sale for over 1/2 off, so worth the price I paid."
4,expected,"You might remember from book 6 and the other previous books that Yu and Miki are together after all they've been through. In this book, Yu continues his search for his real father. In his search, he found a bit of information that he doesn't like. this forces him and Miki to break up and the whole time Miki doesn't know what's going on. Miki moves on with her life without Yu and a new Miki comes out of the book."
2,Real Estate Principal for the NEW Economy,"Just a fair book, I think it addresses the Real Estate World too broadly. I think is is too expensive for the contents."
3,Recommended to me for my Commerical Training Course,"This book was recommended by our Commercial Training Group. I'm still on Part One, but as with most text books, it's a bit dry and could probably be condensed down to just the essentials and practical street knowledge."
5,New book sets a new standard,"""Great book with great CD resources such as Excel files like the cash flow analysis program"" Alex Struck, Developer""Provides an incredibly readable theoretical overview with practical market nuances, resources and advice."" Mike Sklarz, Chief Valuation Officer, FNIS""The first real estate book that is thoroughly integrated with the best of the internet based resources. Skills required of professionals are demonstrated along with the sources of data used for analysis."" A. Florance, CoStar"
4,"Saw them live, bought the CD!","I had the privilege of hearing Cooper and his crew play live at the Juke Joint in downtown Atlanta. He is an impressive guitarist and a solid singer. They (him, his drummer and the basist) played everything from Beatles to Pink Floyd to Bill Withers and nailed EVERY song! They even put a fresh reggae or smooth jazz spin on some oldies and still sounded great. Being a drummer, I was glued to Jason LeMarca the whole time. He's an outstanding drummer who makes even the most complex grooves and fills look virtually effortless. These three guys were tight in Atlanta and this album is Cooper with even more fellow musicians and they sound great. If you're looking for a Stevie Ray Vaughan, smooth jazz, soft to medium instrumental rock album with some catchy riffs, great grooves and good vocals, pick this album up. Support local talent, at the very least. I hope I get to hear Cooper and his crew again sometime soon."
3,Not as described,"The scabbard that arrived on August 1, 2011, is not of the ""top grain leather construction"" described on the Amazon webpage when the item was ordered. It is not riveted and doesn't have a belt clip. It is rather lightweight nylon and is only stitched. It will probably meet my needs, however."
4,Good stuff,"Great all-around fun party music like all other Ursula.A little uneven/disjointed, but that's maybe just because I preferthe long arc of a 70-minute uninterrupted mix.After Ursadelica and All Systems Go Go, I'd place this one third before The Now Sound. I wrote to Urula BTW and found out there's a new one expected in November."
2,Strangely retro,"I love jazz, groove, electronica, chillout, lounge, downtempo, even big band (and all fusions of these), but this album is not a very good one. Every song sounds like the one before it. Not a lot of soul to it. Ursula 1000 did better with their previous album."
4,Great hair.,"Ray conolly who made this profile of Dean, explained the legend with the observation 'He had great hair'The film it self is not in that great condition considering it was put together in 1974.It remains howeverone of the better Dean bios."
1,"sabatier 12"" chef knife","When this knife arrived, it was so dull that it would not cut. Looking at the blade under magnification showed that the grinding was uneven(it had a scalloped appearence) and in places did not even bring the blade to an edge!Although I sharpened it finally with several diamond hones, and it seems to hold its edge ok, I have severe doubts about whatever company let this knife go out totally unfinished. This is definitely not a hand finished product as Sabatier advertises."
1,A giant step backward,"This book is a giant step backward for the girls and women in our society. Just in time for women in Afghanistan to be liberated from their veils and from oppressive laws about not working or going to school, Gurian's new book tells us that American girls are not meant to compete with boys, in the workplace or anywhere else. We are told that their essence is their hormones, and that we need to help girls understand the sanctity, and sacrifices, of motherhood. As a father of a daughter, I am appalled that this book exists, much less that it has been garnering so much media attention."
1,This Book Is Trash,As a young woman I was appauled by Gurian's lack of respect forwomen as human beings.What makes me the most furious is hisshadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she isonly worth something if she squishes herself to allow theboys and men to take the lead in life.The resounding message isgirls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because ofour hormones make important contributions to society beyondtraditional roles.I don't remember ever being taken over byhormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primativechemical reactions he believes all females to be.I agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.Gurianis a master at twisting words around and you have to read hisbooks being mindfull of his tricks.His book is full of agenda.
2,Is this the road to equality?,"While I think Mr. Gurian has some valid points, one has to ask oneself, do you believe in equality of the sexes or do you believe in selective equality ( when it is convenient, or in ones interest). I also am far from being convinced in the wisdom or even the intelligence of ""society's agenda"".Do we even condone boys following their hormonal instincts let alone their reprodictve instincts? Why are girls instincts more sacred? With the population forecast to approach 12 billion by the end of the century, reproduction of each member of our society is not necessarly at the top of the survival list.None of us get all our needs or agendas met; get used to it!"
1,social terrorism,"Is not Gurian invading the borders of our minds?Anyone who is trying to tell you,you can do this but cannotdo that is in my mind a social terrorist.Your mind is the most precious gift you have."
1,How to raise a selfish daughter!,"I was thinking this book was written from a Christian perspective. WOW, was I wrong. If your desire is to raise a WORLDLY, EGOTISTICAL, SELFISH and IMMORAL daughter then this is the book for you. I gave this book 1 star because zero and below was not an option."
5,A must read for Dad's,"Wow, there sure are a lot of angry feminists out there. They obviously need to get a ""3 Family system"" going in their lives! But enough, here is the book review.I felt that this book lent many insights into the makeup (emotional and physical) of girls in a very positive light. Being the Dad to a 7 yr old girl, I have noticed sooooo many differences between her and her twin brother. Why does He like sports, she likes dolls? It has been this way her entire life and now it makes sense. It is very biologically based with hormones leading the way.This book will help you prepare for the future; for me, the adolescent girl. It will help you understand what to expect, prepare for, and handle as your girl gets older.My only critique is that the book has little in the way or charts, pics or tables. It would help those of us who are time pressed, like we full-time Dads!!!Enjoy this read...........I am going to get his book on ""Wonder of Boys"" next......"
3,"Not a great, not bad -- mostly obvious","Personal background note: I have worked as an early stage venture capitalist and regularly review business plans for Angel investment groups.The content of the book is fairly basic but helpful in understand the big issues you will deal with when starting up a business. If you are thinking about starting a company, the book is not a bad sanity check to make sure you have thought through the big issues. The your concept does not pass this sanity check, do not quit your day job.The writing style is very light and good for a quick read which is important for someone thinking about starting a business. You need to be ruthlessly efficient with your time if you are going to succeed.Overall: 3 stars -- there are many books out there on this subject...most say roughly the same thing using the business buzzwords at the printing time. This book is not that much different but very approachable in format and content."
1,Unbelievable,That is unbelievably bad. No legitimate business publishing house would publish this as a business book. Was the thought pattern of this book written by someone entering high school?
5,The best book I've read this year,"After a recommendation from my mentor, I picked this book up and I'm grateful I did. I have directly applied several things from the book and it's already saving me money and more importantly time. This is a no B.S. guide to starting and growing a business - it cuts through the fluff and gets straight to the key points. Definitely two thumbs up!"
2,A bit disappointing,"I have mixed feelings about this book, but ultimately feel that it doesn't offer much advantage over the manuals that come with Final Cut, in fact a lot of it is lifted almost verbatim from the manuals, just doesn't include all the detail. I was hoping for something that could get me up and running fast and then provide answers to questions and problems that come up. But this book takes 275 pages before it gets to editing a single frame and I found that for most answers I needed to turn to the manual anyway. Also the book doesn't address any of the other programs that come with Final Cut Studio and almost treats them like they don't exist (for instance for DVD authoring it tells you to use iDVD when the much more powerful DVD Studio Pro is included with your Final Cut software. I guess if you don't have a hardcopy of the manual it could be useful to have this book, but for me I think it was a waist of money."
4,"Great Book, Too Much Detail...","great information -- but too much detail and flows too slowly. still, I would recommend this to all beginners of Final Cut"
2,Excellent when published for 2003,"published in 2003, in my humble opinion, not evy up to date, would like newer version"
4,works great,"couple years of heavy duty use and still in great shape, much better then stock clutch on my PDP hi hat stand"
4,Great Product,Thie was a great product for the price it was sold for. Fit well on our drum set and would recommend it.
1,Grand finishes for carpentry: A step-bystep guide through...,"I did not find this book very helpful. Few actual photos, mostly sketches, not many ideas for different designs. Though it did have a few good tips and some basic information, it did not go much beyond that. I returned it."
2,basic info - little else,"I was disappointed in ""Grand Finishes"". A great review in the L.A. Times led me to purchase it sight-unseen. It arrived and I was surprised to see very few photos and prety much no ideas for design. Far from grand... There is some good basic info on tools and terminology, to be sure, but ""step-by-step"" seems a stretch. The installation of wainscoating, a large and potentially complicated project, is covered in just a few pages with mostly sketches and small black and white photos. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a guide on an upcoming molding project."
1,not very good,"I actually must have checked this book by accident, but I read it anyway. Im a professional carpenter, so I would say, If you know what a hammer and saw are then you dont need to read this book.I guess Im being a little cruel. If you dont have a single clue about carpentry then this book is ok for you. we make better drawings on the job."
2,"Cheap jack, didn't last","You basically get what you paid for here. The jack's maximum lift is 15 1/2"", so sometimes it won't be high enough for your purposes, but sometimes it may. But it basically worked fine for the three or four times I used it in the first year. After that however, the jack sprouted a leak somewhere, and is essentially useless. You get what you pay for."
4,almost perfect,"I think the quality control could be improved, the sharpening steel came slightly bent and the handle is loose, unfortunately, returning this item is more trouble than its worth. The knives look good and are extermely sharp, over all its a good set of knives at a great price"
4,Mechanic's Resource,I bought the book for my husband's birthday. He did use it later in the year when he had to work on his lawn mower. It provided the answers he needed.
1,Not Good Enough...,"The only two reason this books would worth buying would be:1. This is a Cisco Press book2. There aren't too many books about CID aroundOther than that, this books is not clear written and there are some obvious mistakes. I agree that since the CID exam has such a broad topic list, it's hard to really cover all the points while making them clear. Unfortunately, the editor could not make a good balance between the covering all the topics and making them clear at the same time...Finally, I figured out that printing out the Cisco design documentation online would be more efficient."
2,Needs Some Work...,"I was disapointed by the lack of technical information. Much of the material was outdated and appears to have been written in the past and only moderatly updated to today's standards. Lastly, the diagrams included throughout the book are vague and do not clearly represent what the author is trying to say. That being said, I would only recommend this book if you are already familiar with network design and are looking for a review prior to taking the CID exam..."
1,Isn't worth paper its written on.,"I've taken over 25 exams, including many with Cisco. This book makes it nearly impossible for you to pass if used as a single source. I guarantee you'll find a lot of questions on the exam that are not in the book. Also, most links to web resources even to cisco docs are not working. Book is vague, and if you can't use it to prepare for the exam, you cant really use it in production because it only covers theory, and not much practice."
3,"Good, but missing vital information","This book is good for maybe 80% of the CID exam. It is rather light on VPN and only MENTIONS Stratacom! It's a good book for what's included, but you will need a second source to cover all the exam objectives."
1,Isn't work paper its written on,"Took the exam, I have taken many exams, including with cisco, and trust me. this book is very unreilable, and there were very many questions that the book simply didn't even mention. From usefulness stand point of view, its unworthy because its pure wishywashy theory, with very little usefulness. All in all, a terrible source for exam preparation, and a worthless source for implementing in practice."
1,worst book,I have read many study guides on certification for cisco & Microsoft. This is the worst book i have ever read from exam point of view.
5,The 13th Resource!,"That's right... the 13th resource you want for your ministry is this book! It is creative, challenging and very effective for the new youth worker or an old tenured guy like me. If you work in a church or a para-church ministry, The Top 12 Resources is for you!"
4,Must for YouthWorkers,"I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who works with youth on a weekly basis. It could also be called Youth Worker 101, or Youth Ideas for dummies. It gives you a lot of ideas, and a lot of information every youthworker needs. Jonathan not only can write and is full of ideas, but he has a great website that you will learn about in the book. Good stuff. This review comes from an author, and a youth worker of 20 years."
5,Great Resource,"This is a great resource for any youth worker (full or part-timers). Jonathan provides a lot of working examples of programs, games, and leadership ideas. Besides that, the book comes with lots of reproducible sheets that any youth worker could make use of. The author's writing style is very easy to read and he includes many real-life experiences to strengthen his reasoning. He also makes a point to back himself with relevant scripture. I read the whole book in only a few hours, but continue to go back to it for ideas and insight. As a part-time youth worker, this book provides a lot of ready-to-use ideas that I don't have time to come up with on my own. On top of that, Jonathan provides a lot of encouragement in the text for those working with kids."
3,Loved it as a kid,I remember how I used to love this show as a kid. I liked Mannix's style. I enjoyed the dvds alot. Especially looking at the cars back then. Of course the stuntmen are alot more obviouse now then when I was little but still a good show to watch.
4,Maybe the first DVD ever to deserve a good review just for being released!,"MANNIX ran for eight years, and remains the toughest, grittiest detective show ever created for TV. The fact that it has taken this long to get this show on DVD is a crime that would have Joe Mannix busting heads over. I'll reserve judgment on the final DVD presentation, but (assuming this season is complete) this release has already earned four out of five stars in my book just for finally making it into stores after years of inexplicable delays and indifference on the part of the studio. If there are even a few token extras, this will be a five star DVD.Bluntly, it's about damn time!"
5,Mannix,"Mannix plays it straight, but he plays by his own rules. Every third henchman or goon is named ""eddie"". A woman is slapped in every fourth episode.There was no need to make detective shows after Mannix. It is the greatest Detective Show!"
3,Disappointed in one of the discs,Overall the CD is fine except for one disc. Two episodes are distorted. Cleaning the disc did not help. All other discs are excellent. I will probably not buy from this dealer (Imprint) again because of the bad quality of one of the disc.
5,OMG FINALLY!!!!,"WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME! Mannix was the coolest, sexiest private eye on TV! I really want Season Two because Peggy comes onboard. Gail Fisher was the First African American to win a prime time dramatic Emmy. The romantic chemistry between those two was undeniable although it would never develop because of the times, but it was there all right. My Favorite episode was when Mannix went blind in Season 3...chemistry through the roof! TRIVIA: On the TV show Diagnosis Murder (Dick Van Dyke's show) Mannix made a guest appearance. Van Dyke asked about Peggy and Mannix said ""She's on vacation"" and Van Dyke says ""Well why don't you join her?"", cementing (at least in my mind) what some or all of us wanted to know about their relationship. In the meantime I will be enjoying this classy blast from the past...Season One. SEASON TWO AND SUBSEQUENT SEASONS... HURRY UP AND GET HERE!!"
3,Later seasons are better,"Enjoyable but the later seasons are better. He is the ""rogue"" PI with decent story lines ... but we joke about guessing when he will get hit in the back of the head by a bad guy. Lot's of fist fights and outrageous pistol shooting of the bad guys 30 yards away. Nothing a stiff drink and a cigarette in the middle of the afternoon doesn't cure!"
4,Damaged,I was very disappointed when the book arrived. It was damaged. The upper right front and back cover corner of the book and all the pages had been indented and bent because of poor packaging. This was considered a coffee table book to be displayed and as a result of the damage can not be.

1,Save your money.,"If I'm going to spend 30 dollars on this type of book, I expect a couple of things. First of all, the exercises mentioned should be described. Telling me to do 20 monkey nickel fist jumps, or whatever he decides to call the exercises, isn't going to do me any good. And telling me to look them up on the internet isn't going to help me either. If I wanted to do internet searches, I would've done so. I wouldn't have thrown away my money on this book.Which brings me to the second thing I expect from a book. If I buy a book, I expect it to have been written by someone who sat in front of some sort of word processing application, and put together an actual book. This...thing is just a collection of articles from internet message boards. Again, I could've gotten that information for free.Don't make the same mistake I made. Just click on the ""Amazon.com"" tab, and start over."
5,Views from a Tampa Personal Trainer & BBJ Student,"This is an EXCELLENT BOOK!As a personal trainer and a student of Gracie Barra's, Eduardo DeLima, I am always looking for real, interesting, specific and effective ways to train both myself and my clients. This book has helped me immensely with that goal.It touches on all of the factors in creating a complete MMA Athlete.It is not the typical workout book with only pictures and sample workouts but more of a deep informational and motivational book that will cause you to think and create workouts that are not the traditional bodybuilding or powerlifting programs that will only take you so far as a MMA Athlete.This book is a must for all those who are interested in all MMA sports and being their best."
4,Buy together with the book,"Please see my review of the book. On its own, the book gets 3 stars and the DVD gets 4, but togeters, I give them 4 1/2 stars.GreetingsTom"
5,Not Just for MMA,"As an avid supporter, collegue and friend of Martin Rooney, I can say that once again Martin has put a product out there that all of us can utilize regardless of sport. Although focused on MMA training, many of the attributes that lead to a successful MMA athlete can be utilized in many sports across the board. Martin describes many exercises, drills and movements in a simplistic style that allows this book to be extremely user friendly whether you are a coach or an athlete. We will utilze several of his schemes in our program as well as implement many of the tactical/mental aspects Martin discusses. Congrats on another great product by Martin Rooney and the Parisi Speed School"
5,The prettiest lamp for a little girl,"I received this as a shower gift (actually I rec'd two of them). I put one in my room and my daughter's nursery. This lamp is nice quality (thick shade, good lighting, and easy to use flip.) It is by far the prettiest lamp of all the nursery patterns I have seen. Highly recommended."
4,cool danish flag,"I've been flying this Danish flag in front of my house for awhile now and I think it is terrific. It handles the changing conditions of northern Illinois well, allowing me to celebrate my Danish heritage in style."
4,Dannebrog celebrated!,"Overall this is a great flag, especially for the price! The fabric is light enough to make the flag unfurl in a breeze, but it's not cheap feeling, and the colors didn't run in wet weather. It's perfect for flying on birthdays and Danish national holidays. My only complaint with it is that the flag isn't correctly proportioned. Dannebrog shouldn't be 3x5, the true horizontal should be a bit shorter. (Leave it to Danes to be non-standard!)"
3,"Cheap, decent quality.","I bought this for my dorm room after spending a semester abroad in Copenhagen. The flag is perfect for hanging in my room, but is too cheap for any other purpose. The seams aren't quite straight, and it is fairly transparent. That being said, it looks fine hanging up on my white wall!"
4,"Seasoning Savvy: How to Cook with herbs, Spices and Other Fl","A useful reference book for those who are fascinated with cooking with spices. While the table of contents may seem like many spices are not listed, the thorough index listings cross reference to the alternative names. Individual descriptions of herbs give all the names, list substitutions, characteristics and the types of food suggested for each herb or spice. Interesting suggestions will encourage a cook to try new food/spice combinations."
5,Nice looking watch,"I bought this watch as a present for my wife and she loves it. It looks nice and with good build quality.One hint on removing the wrist band links (for adjustment): you will need 1-mm slotted screwdriver to do-it-self. Once you have this tool, the job is very easy."
4,Nice women's watch,"I bought this watch for my wife. She really likes it, it is simple and elegant. For all occasions. Easy to put on after adjusting the length."
3,"Great watch, but huge band","After reading the other reviews I figured that the watch band would be a little loose, but I had no idea it would be HUGE. I have average to large wrists for a woman and I still had to have 4 links removed for a perfect fit. Other than the fit, I really love the design and quality of the watch. The square face is different and telling time with the small dots vs. a traditional 12,3,6,9 layout isn't so bad."
4,A Good Read!,"Barnet Meltzer, M.D., a health advisor to Olympic athletes and an expert in the clinical practice of preventive medicine, has written a valuable, straightforward guide to a balanced, healthy and successful lifestyle. His book includes plenty of detailed information, advice, techniques and guidelines for physical and emotional wellness, absent any useless fluff or filler. We [...] highly recommend this tidy manual to everyone interested in achieving and maintaining a healthy, less stressful life. Ten rules, no waiting. As self-help goes, this is about as specific and on target as it gets."
2,Not the quality I was hoping for,The pedestal's outer casting is brittle and chipped in several places. It definitely won't stand up to the test of time.
1,Not what I expected,"The pedestal arrived in good condition. However, I believe when I saw the original description it said it weighed 22 lbs. I thought: Great, it won't fall over! HA! First breeze, down it went. Thank goodness I purchased a stainless steel gazing ball instead of a glass one! Very disappointed in the craftsmanship as well. Wish I could send it back!"
1,broken,The Birdbath arrived broken. I still need to return it and get a new one. I am very disappointed that it arrived broken. It was a gift for someone.
4,Man in the Moon Stand,"This is a wonderful addition to any garden - as a small birdbath, feeder or gazing ball holder. It is lightweight but won't blow over with wind! It adds a little whimsy where you want it! (It would be nice if it came in a taller size also)."
4,Depression-but not depressing,"A suspenseful and well-written book. The Orchard gives perspective to whose of us who may think we are enduring a hard winter or are undergoing rough economic times. This is an inside view of living in the worst years of the Great Depression. And this was written by a woman before women's lib, women's studies, etc."
5,Wonderful Read,"I am Gloucester girl now living in Ohio. I just reread The Orchard for the second time in 10 years. It's a wonderful book--really puts our recession into perspective, although all things are relative. A tribute to what women do, and can do, in tough times.Oddly, I had been wondering about a book I once saw and regretted not buying, in Bruni Brothers market in Ipswich-- it was by a local woman and had a picture of a woman rowing in the marsh on it. I never knew the name or author. I got on Amazon today to purchase a copy of The Orchard for a friend of mine. Imagine my surprise when I saw beside it, the book with the woman in the rowboat. The same author! Will purchase it today."
5,celtic piano,"This is a very excellent piano album, elegant and beautifully done. A good pianist with good technique. Many of the pieces are familiar as Carolan harp compositions or songs of Robert Burns and similar celtic folk hits. The arrangements are appropriate and suitable to the music, and they are not turned into pop or rock songs in the course of playing, as some interpreters like to do. I highly recommend it."
4,Nice item if your dog runs at night,"At our local dog park we call these disco lights since so many dogs have them and when they all run around it is a great light show. They do come in different colors. The way they are packaged in the store though the color isn't listed so you get what you get. Visibility is good, but mine says visible at a half mile. That seems like a stretch. Also if you put it on the dogs collar and it dangles down you will only see it when the dog is headed toward you. But all that aside they are fun to have and makes your pet easy to spot when out playing."
2,Fell apart quickly,Unfortunately the pet blinker didn't hold up very well. I think a washer fell out or something but the unit came apart after day 1.
5,Great visibility,"These blinkers really help spot the dog at night. I think it would be a great product for my dog, if I could get it away from the kids!"
4,Does the job,"Not much to say, it does what it is supposed to. Once you have one of these around, it gets hard to imagine not having it. Great for car, great for that dad gum kitty litter.This particular model has very good power and it is amazing what is picked up. I haven't tested to see how long a charge lasts but it is at leat 5 minutes which is plenty considering you just plug it back in after use. A good value."
4,"Great Vacuum, so-so Charger","This vacuum is much more powerful than my old V71007.2 Volt unit. But it's much heavier and just barely hangs on a small tab on the charging cradle. It's sometimes hard to hang in the cradle and I'm afraid it might fall out of it.All in all, not bad."
4,Great for the car,"I bought this specifically for vacuuming the car. I found it to work very well and gets into the tight places. Gets the crumbs out of creases in leather seats and the dirt clots that cleats leave (yes, I have kids!). I have a hand injury so I was worried about the weight. It has not been a problem at all. I also have used it in the kitchen against the baseboards where the vacuum or broom will not quite get, works great."
3,Practical but not so powerful,It is very light and reaches difficult spots. The downside is that it doesn't work on some surfaces and sometimes you just have to go over the same spot six times to get some fibers off the carpet.
5,This thing is amazing!,"I use to have the 9.6 model but I wanted something a bit more powerful. Wow was I impressed with this one. Using it it seems like it is 3X the power, I am very pleased. If you are choosing between this one and the 9.6, get tis one!!!"
3,Not the same item as ordered.,"The product i recieved is not the same as the one ordered. It's a different color, shape and weight than the one shown and different than the original one I bought last year."
3,not bad,"i bought it for cat hair but its better for picking up dust. i found that if i use that rubber broom i saw on TV to pull the cat hair loose from the fibers off the sofa, and finish with the vacuum, it gets like %95 of the bad stuff off the sofa. when you clean it, you get to see just how much dust was hiding on that sofa. yuck!"
4,Great for me~!,"I have a toddler and a preschooler- enough said, right?Well, this handy dandy vac is a lifesaver! I use it several times throughout the day to pick up crumbs, scrap, dirt, shredded up tissue- you name it! It's not loud, it's not heavy- it's perfect for anytime use! I give it 4 stars and not 5, because of the filter."
4,use of product,"Very strong suction, easy to mount on wall,easy to use and clean; especially nice to be able to wash the filters.The only down side is it is heavier than I thought it would be."
3,It's not just the machine.,"I have a cordless wet/dry vac from B&D.; The problem is not with the product, it is with B&D.; Although the instructions advise frequent changes of filters, there seems to be no help from B&D; in obtaining said filters. After much searching I finally found a sou rce for filters but when they came I found that it was a set and only one piece fit into my vac. Needless to say, I am frustrated by the lack of availability of this product.I don't know about anyone else but I don't consider ths a disposable item. It would be nice if B&D; provided a source for filters so that the vac can be maintained over time."
2,Not a satisfied customer,"The only reason I gave this dustbuster 3 stars is because it does a decent job of sucking. However, it is very difficult to clean. The little wheel on the side does absolutely nothing to remove loose dust from the filter. The design is bulky and it is hard to get a grip to pull it apart and it is very tight. (I thought it might ease up a bit or it was a matter of getting used to, but not so.) The filter has small accordion pleats that are next to impossible to get clean. I use a toothbrush to clean out loose dust but even this doesn't do a great job. Washing it doesn't do a whole lot either and it takes a whole day to air dry. After a month of use and cleaning it every time, it looks like it's time for a new filter. The filters are not readily available and expensive considering the extent of use. I haven't had a bad experience with the charger that others have mentioned, but I would not recommend this product and definitely would not buy it again."
1,Dustbuster Design Disaster,"This vaccum is very awkward to use. It is heavy and has an embarassingly poorly designed ""on off"" switch that requires two hands to move from one position to the other. I can't beleive that Black and Decker ever tested this model before production. Sadly, after many years of reliable service we had to replace our older much lighter and more functional model with this frustrating household appliance."
3,Average,"Not very powerful. Sometimes I have to run the dustbuster over the same thing twice. Sometimes I have to pluck the thing off the carpet and feed it into the dustbust... then I ask myself, wait, why am I doing all the work???"
1,Great for 1st year then you can't replace the battery!,"Have had my cyclonic for about a year and a half. Worked fantastically for that first year and then we noticed it wasn't staying charged as long as it should - which means decreased suction. Did a little research and found that many other people have had the same problem. The biggest issue I have is that you cannot replace the battery!! So I guess Black & Decker expect all of us to buy a new DustBuster every year...not to mention how environmentally unfriendly this is. Right now, I'm able to use it for about a minute before it starts loosing suction to the point where I can't pick up anything more than cracker crumbs. VERY disappointed in this product."
3,Great Vac but...,"I had my cordless vac for just over 2 years - at first it worked great - but after about a year, the battery life began to get shorter and shorter, now it only runs for about a minute before being too dead to do any good. I went on the B/D web site and found the battery pack replacement, (kudos for B/D ease of battery pack replacement - 2 screws and the back pops off and the pack slides out) anyway, the replacement pack costs $33.67 -- Seems a steep price to pay considering I only really got a year out of the thing - now replacement will almost cost me as much as I paid new for the whole thing! I haven't decided if I want to buy the pack or just buy a new one.I am not sure if I'd buy another if they only last a year or so."
2,"Worked great, until the battery developed memory...","...and now it won't take more than a tiny charge, barely enough to run at full speed for 1 minute. It lasted a year."
3,"Good in Dust Busting, bad in Charging","This Unit is Good in Dust busting, easy to use.But the quality and the design of the charger seems tovery bad . My Duster buster stopped charging just after 3 weeks of Purchase."
4,Dustbuster Review,"This Dustbuster has very strong suction and cleans well, but it does not seem to hold its' battery charge for very long. Overall it is a good product."
4,Dustbuster,"This is my third Dustbuster over the past 20+ years and it is so far the best one. First was original model when there was no choice of power or voltage and it ran for less than 10 minutes. The second one I believe was a 7.5 volt and ran for 10 minutes, but lost a lot of power the last couple of minutes. This one runs strong for a full 15 minutes and doesn't blow the dust around like previous model. Also it's easy to get on/off the charger base. The last model I had I threw out because the flimsy wire connector on the base broke. I use the Dustbuster mostly for vacuuming up the tracked kitty litter around two cat boxes, and quick pick-ups on the bathroom floors, and this model is great for that. Only slight drawback is a little difficulty removing the dust collector; however I think this is due to the good seal which prevent any blow-back of dust."
1,Poor Battery!!!!,"This was a great hand vac at first, but soon the battery wouldn't hold a charge. Now about 2 years later I get about 30 seconds to suck up the crumbs in the high chair. I will never buy a black and Decker Dust Buster again. I have suffered with this things short battery for a long time. It seemed from the beginning the batteries life was slowly getting shorter and shorter."
4,product works well,"I'd agree with the later reviewers that this product isn't the power house hand held that can replace a wired vacuum. However, it will do the job slightly better than cheaper models.I've had two of these over the last year and the quality seems to be consistently good - although on both vacs, the lower power sucking switch is flaky and sometimes doesn't make contact.Battery life on both models seems to be around 20-30 minutes. I try to drain battery life before a recharge and I believe this helps with the battery life. Attachment pieces don't always hold well in the compartments at the bottom of the unit.Given the price reductions on this vac, it is great value and the 4 star rating is deserved."
5,Great portable vac!,"Charges fast, works great. Can take it anywhere especially in the car to vacuum dirty floor mats."
5,TEErific,battery could last a little longer but i am just being greedy. i tried to vacuum my car and my girlfriend's on high power (14 volts). great vacuum. WELL worth the buy. you cant find a better deal for the price i believe.
5,Great suction. good battery life,i use this for vaccuming up in the car and around the house. this has serious suction and lasts for 15-20 mins between charging. def worth it.
1,"Need a ""Zero Stars"" rating","I've had hamsters live longer and have more staying power. Not even two years old yet and the battery is dying. It lasts about 45 seconds and half of that time, it's just wheezing and hardly picking up anything. Try finding a battery.... and if you do find one, don't expect it to last, either. They should offer a retrofit NIMH battery pack for this model - it worked well until the battery started to go bad. NiCad is dead technology - B&D should know this. And why pay half the cost of a new one for another piece of junk battery? Probably good this model is no longer available. Word to the wise, though - the new models don't even have a replaceable battery.."
4,Overall a Good Buy,"This is the most powerful battery powered handheld vaccum I could find without getting insanely more expensive. So far I havn't had trouble with it picking up anything like rocks in my car or cat food. It has 2 speeds so you can use the lower speed to make the battery last longer. At full speed it last no more than 10 minutes which is fine for any small job. Recharge time could be quicker, I think it takes about 10 hours to recharge."
5,Dynamic DustBuster,This is the absolute best DustBuster I have owned! I has lots of power and the crevice tool makes getting into small places a snap. The 14.4 Volts really makes a difference in suction power! It is easy to clean and has a two stage filtration system. I would highly recommend this product for anyone needing a superb hand held vaccuum.
3,"ok, but not what i was expecting...","I bought this to get the dog hair off of my stairs because my upright vacuum had difficulty with the smaller spaces. The result? There is still dog hair on my stair case. Granted they shed a lot, I was able to get up some, but definitely not all. A lot less power than I expected from reading other people's reviews. It also died fairly quick, granted on a handheld cordless. But is great for non carpet surfaces! I wouldn't recommend for vacuuming out your car if you have animals!"
4,Stand Back,"All I can say is, ""WOW"". This beats my last DustBuster by a mile. It was definitely more expensive than my first basic model, but well worth it. The sucking action is fantastic albeit a bit noisy. I use it in a child care setting and the noise does take the children off guard but several of them love to help with it just the same. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I do have some difficulty removing the dust container when it needs to be emptied."
5,Big Power,"Over the years I've had many versions of the DustBuster. This one is the best suction-wise, which is what it's all about. It's not as easy to empty as some of the smaller versions, but it has a large capacity, so I don't need to empty it often."
5,****AMAZING****,The most powerful cordless handheld vacuum that I've ever owned. I just hope that the battery on this one doesn't fail as early as the other Black & Decker ones that I've owned in the past.
5,Very easy to use,"I honestly don't know how I lived without this. Cleanup has never been easier! The suction power on this little DustBuster is incredible. It sucks pieces of trash from almost a foot away. Great for cleaning those hard to reach corners under cabinets.My kids love it! It is light weight enough for them to use. Now they clean up their own messes instead of running to mommy.When the unit is full, it is easy to pop off the nozzle and empty into the trash. The hepa filter cleans easily with a spray of water.The whole thing is very easy to understand. I had it out of the box and running in a matter of minutes without pulling out the manual."
3,LImited Life,"Ni-Cad Batteries still need to be outlawed. This guy lasted about two years with occassional use. Replacing with a NiMh battery would make it last longer.Still, I might replace it with the same. The cost is justified. But, if I find a cordless hand vac that uses NiMh batteries, then I am going for that."
1,"Started out fine, then got worse and worse","I got mine about a year ago, and finally threw it away last week. For a while it worked fine, then a charge lasted fewer and fewer minutes until for the past few months it wouldn't take a charge at all. I hope your experience is better than mine, but I will not buy another DustBuster - there have to be better ones out there."
2,I don't like mine,"This dustbuster is supposed to have a revolutionary filtration system. The only problem is that it totally clogs up every time you use it. The manual suggests you spin the wheel to clean the filter. That snaps the pleats on the filter. But the whole thing is a gimmick. You have to dissasemble the filter after every use and use the sprayer on your kitchen faucet to clean it.The good part is that the suction is good. But man, washing the filter after every use is a pain."
2,battery issues,"I purchased this product for my sister last Christmas. She's disabled and a cordless hand-held vac is perfect for her and she uses it every day to pick up dust, dirt, and kitty litter. Unfortunately it's now November and the battery no longer charges to full strength. So I looked on line to find replacement batteries which is impossible. Then I read a review here and discovered that they are about as expensive as replacing the whole thing not to mention the difficulties replacing the battery once you find one. Not something my sister can do on her own. I wish they made a hand vac that has easily replaceable batteries like they do for battery-charged screw drivers and the like. I also agree that it doesn't hold a charge as long as the manual states. If it runs constantly you'll be lucky to get it to last five minutes, even when it's new. Unfortunately she cannot find the receipt so we can't get a replacement under warranty."
5,B&D DUSTBUSTER MUCH MORE POWERFUL,THIS IS A GREAT TOOL FOR OUR OFFICE. IT IS CERTAINLY POWERFUL ENOUGH. SORT OF GLAD THE OTHER ONE DIED.
5,Black & Decker Dust Buster,Excellent purchase. Does a great job. Very powerful vacuum. We are very happy with this purchase
4,Good duster,We finally upgraded from our 10 year old Dustbuster.... Why did we wait so long?This works great and isn't much bigger than the original. Much better power and the battery lasts much longer.
3,Works,I bought the product a few weeks ago and it has been very useful to clean small parts of the house especially the steps and also inside the car.It has worked well so far.
5,Powerful!,"I bought this to replace my 7 year old 7 volt Dustbuster. Wow! This one really is powerful. A bit on the heavy side, but worth it's weight."
5,Works great!,"I purchased this DustBuster mainly for cleaning the car's interior and for vacuuming the staircase (which can be a pain with a regular heavy vacuum cleaner). The suction is great and the battery charge lasts long enough. Although I'm unable to compare this product with others, I would highly recommend this DustBuster."
4,good dustbuster!`,good dust buster and picker upper..good strong suction..battery lasts a decent amount of time..conveniant wall hook ..good A++however amazon did take 6 weeks to send me mine
5,Great for the price!,"This is a great little vacuume. It has a lot of suction. I havnt had a problem with it yet. My only complaint is that inside there is/was a small rubber piece that went over the hole inside the vacuume. I thought it was a piece of trash that I sucked up and accidentally ripped it out. So far I havnt notice a problem because of that, but just a warning not to rip it out like I did. Definantly worth it though!"
5,Dustbuster,Very nice product. Amazon had the best price for this product. Lot's of power and long run time between charges.
4,Black & Decker CHV1400 14.4-Volt Cyclonic DustBuster,Powerful but a bit heavy to handle and a bit difficult to remove plastic piece to clean out debris. Overall does the job very well.
2,Running low on power,"We have had this hand vac for several years now and I have to say it is really starting to annoy me. It must have worked well in the beginning because I don't remember being frustrated with it. However, now it always out of battery (even if it has been charging for days) and doesn't have any suction(even if I just cleaned it out)."
5,Great when you have a toddler!,"Picks up crumbs very quickly! Even has a small brush that attaches, so if you really need to pick up dirt that is fine, this is an excellent product."
2,Mediocre,"Decent suction power, but a slew of design hiccups make this a barely adequate piece of equipment. Cleaning out the chamber is a mess because hair gets stuck in the nozzle and dust is all over the filter instead of collected in one place. The filter has a ring which you're supposed to twist to clean but the ring is incredibly difficult to turn so it's mostly useless."
3,Good but not the perfect solution,"I bought this vaccum to clean my car, I have cloth interiors it does a pretty good job but does not clean every thing, I have to pickup after it sometime."
3,Vacuum snail collector really Sucks,"This vacuum snail collector works on the principlethat ""masses are better"", whereby collecting a largenumber of snails will thereby cut the labor time itnormally takes to amass such creatures. It uses a .6gvacuum engine which is quiet and sturdy, doesn't needmaintenance and can even be used near ponds, wherenails tend to congregate. If you are a restaurateur,then this is a great product for selling ""fake Frenchescargots"" for the amount it takes to pay a hermit tocollect them."
1,Little Suction and then Stopped Working altogether,"I bought this item because it is cordless and I thought it would be as good as the Black & Decker that uses rechargeable batteries, I was wrong. The suction was dissapointing, and it stopped working after only a few uses. I was so irritated. I don't recommend this item, it just doesn't cut it. I lost my money because I would have been too embarassed to return an item that was dirty on the inside. So I just had to throw it in the trash. What a waste of money!"
4,pretty good for the price,It does the work. I wish the front Nozzle was a bit wider. it misses on hard surfaces
5,Extremely pleased with it!!,"I've had the worst luck with cordless hand-held vacs, by other manufacturers. As the ""mommy"" of two cats, this vacuum is essential for cleaning litter from around the litter box. It's extremely powerful and has a great system for cleaning the internal filter, between thorough cleanings. Another feature I like is the angled intake flap, which eliminates the litter from falling out when you turn it off, then hang it up. Black & Decker really gave the design of this vacuum some great thought and important features. Thanks!!"
5,Superior Performance,"I have owned many dustbusters, all with inferior to mediocre suction. The Black & Decker CHV1400 is unbelieveable. It is the most efficient of it's kind. The suction is fantastic. It does the job and more. No messy filter to clean. Just empty cup. Charge lasts long time. Keep it clean and charged and you'll always be ready for quick cleanups!"
4,Help at Last!,"This dustbuster lives up to all the glowing reviews I read before purchasing it. It's more powerful than my vacuum cleaner, easy to use and clean, and all that for a great price. If one can handle the slightly heavier weight, I can't imagine going wrong with this purchase."
4,Good Dust Buster,This is 3rd B & D Dustbuster that I have owned. The first one wore out. The second wasn't very useful as it was a combo dustbuster and small job vaccuum cleaner with a long handle like a regular vaccuum cleaner. When the battery gave up I tossed it as it wasn't a very good product. This new one is a little more powerful and so far am happy with it.
5,Perfect for kid messes!,"I purchased this item because I have two young children, one an especially messy baby who likes throwing his food on the floor. Since my kids are allergic to dogs, I needed something convenient, portable, cordless, and powerful. This DustBuster did not disappoint. I use it up to 5 times a day (3 meals and 2 snacks!) and it is perfect for picking up whatever non-wet and non-gooey food has landed on the floor. It's also great for Play-dough and craft messes (glitter, paper scraps, etc.). It is very easy to empty (no bag) and comes apart easily for cleaning. We just disassemble it and rinse all the pieces in the sink. I've read that some other reviewers have a problem with it holding a charge, but mine has never pooped out on a mess. I highly recommend this product."
1,Battery Short Lived,"My battery at the one year mark will only run the vacuum for 3 or 4 minutes before losing all charge. The vacuum performed adequately, but I would stay away if you are purchasing a product to use longer than 6 months."
5,DustBuster over the top,"This is my third DustBuster and without a doubt the best one ever. It is very well made, has fantastic suction and long run time. We have one at both our home and office.Thanks B&D;."
1,Don't waste your money on this vacuum,"It has difficulty picking up plain old dust on hard surfaces. When you have to keep going over the same spot to get it clean, the vacuum is not doing its job correctly. Unless you put the attachment on, you can forget about this thing vacuuming carpeted areas. I tried a Shark after I bought this piece of junk, and it was a completely different, and satisfactory cleaning experience. Maybe I got a lemon, but I'm done with weak B&D vacuums for good."
2,Blck & Decker dustbuster,"Finally, I thought I had a good dustbuster. It had a long lasting charge and had good suction. But, just like previous ones, it is dead after just 14 months. So here I am on another search for one that isn't junk."
1,Stopped charging first week,Defective charger. Won't hold a charge and is now useless. A complete waste of money.
3,Worked fine then-----,"I bought this DVD recorder last Aug. When I got it it worked fine. Then lately I tried using some DVD-RW new disc. and when I put it in it has to format it - it goes to about 20% done then says some message of an error & spits it back out. Now it is starting to do the same thing with the DVD-R when I put it in then it says a message of ""disc can not be played"" and opens the tray back up. If I retry it it then will accept it, but I am afraid that the recording part is about to quit.So far it will play a video ok, it is the recording part that is acting up for me. I am trying to use brand new Maxwell DVD-R/RW."
2,"you can record stuff, you just can't watch it","I purchased this DVD player/recorder roughly 3 years ago. It has been pretty solid. I was able to play any movie I wanted in it, and the picture quality was fantastic. I paired it up with a Samsung LED TV and I was extremely impressed. Unfortunately, over the past year, playing movies in it has been hit or miss. I originally purchased the player so that I could record TV shows & home movies directly to DVD. That feature still works great. I can also play low quality video (like older Sesame Street DVDs) on it and the playback is fine. When I try to play a HD movie in it, the player lasts about 45 minutes and starts to skip scenes, freeze and eventually eject the disc. I still love that I can plug in my DV camcorder & record the mini DV tapes directly to DVD. I'm going to keep it for this capability. Unfortunately, I can't watch the videos on teh same player."
4,"Stylish, quality and easy to use.","Overall it's a good dvd recorder and hdtv tuner. If you have a HDTV monitor, this would be a perfect choice. Recording OTA HDTV programs is very easy and high quality. I give it a four star because the picture quality is not as good as my DirecTV receiver, but that's just a matter of opinion."
1,Don't buy this unit,"My main reason for dissatisfaction is that the player rejects 85% of the DVDs I try to play, including new ones just out of the case. I am going to junk the DVD-AR650 as soon as I get a new (definitely NOT a Samsung) DVD player."
2,Needed repair after only a month,"This is a tough one to review. The ease of use and recorded quality are as advertised. But I had to return it after less than a month because it stopped playing or recording. Be forwarned, the customer must pay the shipping cost. Also, DVDs recorded from the tuner or cable box won't even play on my other Samsung DVD player. The instructions state that recorded DVDs may not play on all makes. But not even on one of their own players? Fortunately, copies made from my VCR tapes and camcorder work just fine on the other player. I wish I had known about these problems before making the purchase."
5,The Seven Isles of Ameulas,"Here is a novel of poetic beauty and heroic prose. The book contains riveting adventure, rollicking friendships and tender, romantic love. Fahy has created characters who are brave beyond belief, lovable, likable and despicable. I recommend this book to all lovers of fantasy reading."
5,FLAWLESS AND BRAVE,"'The Seven Isles of Ameulas' is a brilliant example of beautiful literature breaking through the traditional publishing monopoly, which is determined to maintain its iron-grip censorship with smear terms like 'vanity press.' This is exquisitely published poetry of the highest order. Inspiring and majestic. Flawless."
