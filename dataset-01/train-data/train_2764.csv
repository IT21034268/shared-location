5,great comforter,I was very pleased with this comforter. The colors are nice and bright. My daughter is in love with it.
1,Save your money!,What a worthless tool. You can find a lot better for your money than this overpriced excuse for an accessory. Dewalt should be ashamed for putting this on the market.
1,Type 1 guard DW4705,"Purchased this guard from Amazon. This guard seems to be required for diamond cut off blades (for cutting concrete blocks and pavers). It provides more protection around the blade and is more heavy duty than the Type 27 guard provided with the tool. The flange provided for 1/8"" wheels does fit, however, the guard itself does not fit the DeWalt D28402 4 1/2"" grinder.It has a completely different attachment method than the type 27 guard (spring clamp). (Maybe if you do a lot of bending it will work...)Check your model number before ordering."
5,Works...if used correctly,I've used this deodorant for 3 years and the best way to use it is to make sure you rinse it with water after you use is under each arm pit. i.e. left-arm-pit rinse with water then use under right-arm-pit and rinse with water then let air dry. Your skin naturally has bacteria on it so there is a possibility of cross contamination. It's a proven system and I never have any smelly oder. During an emergency I forgot my Crystal Stick Body Deodorant and I used a popular commercial name brand deodorant and hours later I developed a pimple under my armpit. This happened twice in two separate instances. The healthier way is going as natural as you can and Crystal Stick Body Deodorant is one of the best ones out on the market.
2,it is not an antiperspirant,"For the last couple years, I have been using the crystal deodorant stick. Lately, the crystal doesn't seem to be doing its job and I am tired of having wet underarms because the crystal is not an antiperspirant."
1,Doesn't work a bit,"I'm not a particularly stinky person, but I mean, I need deodorant. I was really excited about getting this crystal stick because it seemed pretty healthy to use and was supposed to last for a long time. That's super. Only, it really doesn't work. I definitely still get a smell when I sweat. Sooo, yeah, I'll be moving on to something else. Too bad!"
3,Works OK,"This works OK as long as you aren't too active. On the days when I just sit at my desk at work I don't stink. If I'm outside or doing any active movement I start to notice myself after a while. I'm not a terrible sweater, either.Pros:Lasts (seemingly) foreverInexpensiveCons:Doesn't provide a good smell (just eliminates most of the bad)Doesn't hold up well under pressure"
5,Smell is gone!,"I've had a problem with smelling for years, and no deodorant could fix the problem (I don't have a sweat problem though). This stone has instantly fixed the problem... no more smell!! It's amazing. I love it. If you have a sweat problem though, this won't work... it isn't antiperspirant. So if you have a smell problem, I HIGHLY recommend it... sweat problem, it won't help with that. My husband uses this too, and loves it. So do both of my parents."
1,This product does not work for me.,"I used this stuff as directed, including washing first, but I smell just as bad as ever within a couple of hours. I'm glad everyone else in these reviews had such good luck with the product, but it doesn't work for me.By the way, the plastic cap is very thin and it cracked in the mail, with the result that it won't screw on. I taped it together with monofilament tape, which also didn't work. But that doesn't matter. I'm just going to throw the whole thing out.Just saying."
3,It's not natural ingredients as they claim,"Ok, so far it works. But when I bought it, I didn't realize that it has Ammonium Aluminum, which is a ingredient present in many regular deodorant products. Aluminum-containing products have a reputation for being toxic to health. Oh well!"
3,A good idea,May sound strange but I did not use this for my underarm. The salt kills bacteria so I tried it for the acne on my face. Did help but was not as strong as other things.
1,I have to agree with Ivan,"I'm a female that doesn't sweet or have bad odor at all and any other deodorant out there has worked fine for me. I gave this one a try just because it is healthy. I hate the fact that I don't feel I'm putting anything on, is like rubbing a piece of plastic on. You only feel the water from weating it, nothing else goes on. Is basically putting on nothing. I smell just as if I didn't put anything on. Don't even think about going to the gym only wearing this. I weat it and applied a lot, since it doesn't work I have to put some more later on and then the stick starts smelling like bo. It goes away after rinsing it though. It just doesn't work for me, and can't understand how can it worked for others."
3,Crystal Stick Deoderant,I received the product within a week of order and was quite satisfied with the way it worked. The price was lower than I would have paid over the counter at a local store.
1,Crystal Stick Deodorant,"This product is a real disappointment. If I had an accurate understanding of it, I would not have purchased it."
1,Terrible,"This product does not work. You have to moisten it to apply it-which makes it messy, it does not go on easily or well, and within a few hours it is obvious that it does not do its job. Threw it away after using it once!"
1,Totally disappointed,"I ordered this item because of the favorable reviews and because I use natural health products. Frankly, it did not work as others have touted and I won't be purchasing the product again. This is especially disappointing because the weather isn't even hot yet and it failed to work. I will stick with Tom's deodorant or use an aluminum-free stick by Mennen."
1,No effect,"I tried this out hoping it'll be a good replacement for standard deodorant. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out that way. On my first day of using it I began to smell like armpit within hours of application. So I figured I'd try to add some more, I did as directed then applied again. The smell still remained, but ever the hopeful one, I tried again in the morning after. When I opened it that day I smelled my own armpit odor radiating from the crystal. Upon a closer inspection, I realized the stick not only failed to deodorize anything, but had taken on the odor that I bought to dispose off. I tried washing it off but it still lingered. So I tossed it and continue my search for an another alternative.It may have worked for others but it definitely failed me. I wouldn't be willing to spend the money for another shot at it"
4,Travel size worked when full size didn't,"Works great as a deodorant. I used this travel size with success for weeks and then bought the full size crystal. Full size failed me in every way. Sweat and stink. So I'm back to the travel size. This small size lasts much longer than any conventional deodorant. Antiperspirant qualities: even though it makes no claims to be such, I think it sill helps somewhat. Regular deodorants clogged my pores and seemed to make me sweat even more. I have perspired wearing this, but it seems to be less than with regular deodorant/antiperspirants. Have been using this for about a month and a half."
2,Works for half of the day,"Tried this a few years ago. Unfortunately if you are mildly active, it wears off fairly quickly and while you might not smell as bad as if you had not used anything, you'll still smell pretty bad. Perhaps another crystal formula works better?"
1,Did not work for me,"This deodorant did not work at all for me. It was almost worse than wearing nothing at all. I sweated a lot and smelled terrible, starting very early on in the day."
5,Crystal Deodorant,i was a little hesitant at first but the product is great. It doesn't come off on your clothes and you never feel damp. It leaves a strange sensation when you first put it on- but no stronger than if you had put on a lotion that has menthol in it. Absolutely fantastic- highly recommend it.
2,doesn't go on smoothly or provide much odor protection,"Even after following the instructions on the deodorant, I found that it did not go on smoothly and it did not do a great job at offering 24 hr odor protection."
2,Not great,I had high hopes when I bought this product and read the reviews but unfortunately it's not worth the money. The product was damaged when I received it. I'm not sure if it was from shipping or before it was shipped. As far as the product itself I didn't feel it kept the odor away so I actually ended up throwing it out.
5,SOLD,I was a skeptic but since I like try interesting things that better my life and the environment I tried it and it works! I love it I also use a roll on oil bottle that I add a dab of just so I can have some scent but the overall performance is just wonderful!
1,Disappointed,It must be me because everyone else seems to love this product. I followed the application directions and it did not work for me. I had the same result as if I had not used any deodorant. It is also very heavy for its size. I want a small and light unscented travel sized deodorant. I will use my current unscented deodorant for travel. It is slightly larger but it is also much lighter.
5,Good Product,I had this rock for months now. is getting to the last of it useable life but compared with I use to spend in deodorant man! this is a good product. I am glad my girlfriend introduced me to the crystal. I most said I was skeptical due to previews experiences with natural products that just don't work. good attempts but just did not really work. I am not a big sports guy I seat a lot behind computers but still stick if I don't use deodorant. I just bought a second rock after almost a year. Good for you good for the environment.
4,Different brand,"The brand I ordered and the brand I received, are not the same. However, the brand I received is the same type of product. and seems to be the same, just a different name."
5,Great Deodorant,I have always had issues using some types of deodorant but this works great! Goes on very smooth just after a shower and lasts and lasts! Most deodorants don't even offer that much protection and supposedly it supposed to last close to a year! Great deal! I was skeptical at first but now a believer!
3,"Works ok, but crystal cannot stay in the container","My wife and I wanted to try a more natural deodorants. We never found the Tom's to last past a few hours. For the most part, we enjoyed the Crystal deodorant. I would not say we spelled shower fresh all day, but it was effective and we smelled no noticeable difference than our other more common deodorants we've used in the past. The stick lasts forever which is great. Unfortunately, we have not been able to use two full sticks because after a couple of months, the crystal is no longer secure in the plastic tubing. This causes the crystal to fall out like a rock. We have broken both sticks on the sink & tile floor of our bathroom."
3,"Ok, but not great","I usually use this just before using my antiperspirant/deodorant. I know it's meant to be its own deodorant, but I do not find that it works too well when used alone. I do think that when used with my my regular deodorant it helps keep me fresher all day - reduces that mid-day sweat/perfume mix. I do not sweat a lot, but am really sensitive to feeling fresh all day and the Crystal does help some."
5,Best I've Ever Used,This product is incredible. I have always been a heavy sweater even when I am not exercising so the BO I get can be pretty bad but this stuff eliminates that odor completely! I still sweat but can go a full day even two days without smelling. Product is easy to use and natural which is nice.
4,Safe and works for me,"Frankly I purchased this about a year ago (and for less at my local store) but did not use it more than a couple times before going back to my usual deodorant (secret). I recently went on vacation and left my deo in my carryon which wasn't in the bathroom... after my shower I applied the crystal product and was pleasantly surprised. I like that it has no smell, no chemicals, seems to work quite well. So I have used it for a couple weeks now after every shower and I think I'll be sticking to it. I also like that it doesn't ""cake"" up on my pits like traditional deodorant lol. Also it seems like its going to last a LONG time so cost wise it seems like a good value based on the local price that I paid (under $5).Definitely worth a try if you want something more natural that works."
5,Great for Travel,"I use this when I travel because it lasts and lasts! For swimming though, I use the traditional waterproof type."
5,"Touching, Funny, Thought Provoking","Simon's adventures are great fun to read, but also make you think about how we live our everyday lives. Each story seems to have multiple meanings. I think Simon is trying to teach us to be better people. Great fun - I didn't want it to end!"
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I expected MUCH more than this...but I simply could not believe how CHEAP this thing looked!!!! It's only like 6 inches tall, and it looks like something that would be sold at a native american museum...thin, hardly muscular at all, poorly painted, and little to no detail at all. A child could make a better version of this with clay.Folks, i wish I was exagerating here, but I'm not. THIS PIECE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! No wonder there isn't even a photo for it! Even for the hard-core Conan fan, this is NOT worth buying at all. Garage-sale junk!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!"
1,Not a 5 pack!!,"Clearly states that it is a 5 pack of video cards and only 1 card was delivered. A prompt return was accepted even though I was fine with them sending the remaining 4 cards separately, therefore wasting my time as they never intended on sending 5 cards and are intentionally misleading in the title and description."
1,Awful!,"I never usually write a review for anything and this is not going to be a thorough review either but I just wanted to share my thoughts about this book. This book is very frustrating to read and understand (its awful!) I feel the need to read the context more than 5 times to understand what it is trying to convey, it is just very confusing especially if you have no prior knowledge about the different theories the author explains. I wished my professor would have chosen a different book for our Learning class. The only positive thing that I like about this book is the stories that the author shares in the beginning of each chapter. The book would be better if it included more real life examples in everything that the author talks about."
5,Drowned Wednesday,"Created with sheer beauty and imagination, Garth Nix has created something extraordinary in the Keys to the Kingdom. These books are sure to gain parental support as they clearly encourage children to open up their imagination and to explore the wonders around them. Drowned Wednesday is fun, exciting, and hard to put down. Take my advice, and make Keys to the Kingdom your next read."
5,Astounding!,"This book is new! It is not like Grim Tuesday, which was a total let-down. Pick up this book now before your friends do. You want to be the first to read this fantastic new book!"
4,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Its really good, but the beginning was a bit boring. Also, Arthur is OBSESSED with being hurt, which can be tiresome. But the rest is brilliant. I cannot wait for Sir Thursday. See you in line!"
4,This was an indepth book about Zen Buddhism,"The book was very informative and insightful. It contained poems written by Zen masters from China, Japan and Korea. There was a briefing on the lives of Zen masters but over all it was very interesting to read. It helps you understand Zen a bit better. Who knows maybe you'll realize that ""it is useless to pray to the gods about your destiny"" What will happen will happen. We as humans have no control over it, so it is best to accept things as they are."
5,The Roaring Stream,"What a splendid way to begin each day by reading a short chapter or two in this well-structured and informative anthology. By providing some biographical and historical context for each entry, the editors provide a base from which to step off into more ethereal levels. I've read in Zen off and on for 40+years. This book is as useful and helpful as anything I've found. In their introduction, the editors themselves express a disdain for thetrend in recent decades to reduce Zen to a collection of pithy observations and hip greeting card sentiments. They were striving for accessible depth. Gary Snyder's comment on the cover that ""this is the reader to carry with you on the Way"" is as good a recommendation as one might hope for."
5,Great resource,"Ms Zukowski provides key insights for the non-profit group or organization that is seeking to position itself with major donnors. Her practical and effective recommendations will save significant time and effort.For Corporations already active in non-profit funding, or those corporations interested in creating foundations, etc., will find this book helpful in working with groups seeking assistance."
4,"More smoky, booze soaked goodness","If you dig Mr. Airplane Man's sound on C'mon DJ, you'll like this EP. We're talkin' stripped down garage blues, chock full o' reverb and distortion. Other than ""Hang Up"", all the tracks are fresh. The title song rocks hard with superfuzz lead guitar layered over the band's trademark primitive stomp. ""Round and Round"" is a Chuck Berry cover--cool, but not as interesting as the Germs version.Great for those nights when it's 3am and you're drinking Thunderbird in the dark, before you drag out the Coltrane records."
1,Like reading an advertisement,"I bought this book along with three others that included tips on getting an interview, job offer, and then negotiating salary. This one was wordy and interspersed with advertisements for The Five O'Clock Club. It was also a bit heavy on worksheets and self-assessment tools. I found myself skipping over large sections at a time.I give the book one star because it does have good tips on salary negotiation, but I think there are other books out there that ""have it all,"" including the salary neg. tips. My personal fave is ""60 seconds & You're Hired"" by Robin Ryan. I've read it before a few job interviews and have felt prepared and confident. 5 O'clock Club, on the other hand, feels like a big homework assignment I just don't want to face."
4,Good compilation by some power metal masters,"In my opinion Stormwitch is equal if not more important than Helloween in forming the power metal genre. Unfortunately us in the United States seldom enjoy the delights of European metal, which I think has left American metal in the dust. Maybe 3 of my top 10 favorite bands are American. If you can get your hands on a Stormwitch album and are even remotely into Helloween, Hammerfall, old Nocturnal Rites, etc, you will not be dissapointed. Stronger than Heaven is one of the greatest albums of the 80's, and War of the Wizards is a concept album that documents the Lord of the Rings. After 8 years since Shogun came out, Stormwitch has just come out with a new full album in 2002, ""Dance with the Witches."" It's probably only availible in Germany though."
1,Failed just beyond warranty,"I bought this vacuum almost 4 years ago. It worked well while it lasted, but has failed just 1 year beyond the warranty. I used it lightly, perhaps once every two weeks. I took it apart and determined that the motor failed (not something like a switch or wiring that could be fixed cheaply). My next vacuum will be a Ridgid - if they're willing to stand behind their product for life, they must be using better components."
3,Nice brush,This is a nice brush. I looked at other brushes at Target that are not made as well and cost more. This one come with 3 mop heads and the head is padded so that the plastic will not scratch the car. The only problem I had was the slow shipping.
3,Fun...with real people,"The best thing about this game is its multi player, obviously. its extremely fun but, their's to many things wrong with this zelda. Here's one of the problems- its to repetitive. I cant tell you how many times Dark Link tried to kill me or how many times i had to hit vaati and did i mention in every level you do the same thing. But its all very, very fun. Eventually though the repitition will start to ware down the fun you are having. I know multi player is the whole thing with this game but what if you're like me and you're friends arent always around? you'll get bored to death because playing this game by yourself is like watching paint dry or dry paint. Nintendo should have created a mini single player adventure along with it. I love this franchise i have almost every game(ive beaten this one), this was probalbly one of the worst zelda games ive played. (i enjoyed the whole thing with the gba)"
2,Doesn't Even compare to any other Zelda Game.,"I bought this game hoping that it would as good or btr than all the other Zelda Titles i have played but i personally thought it really didn't live up to the title. I suppose that multiplayer it would prob. actually be pretty fun but i ""not owning a gm advance"" nvr got to try that. Anyways for one player the game was difficult and really not that fun...wierd crappy graphics....and i don't really get why they couldn't have just made a game with one link....all in all if you are buying this for multiplayer try it out...but if i not i wouldn't even buy it....just play windwaker tell twighlight princess comes out....."
5,Going To Be a BIG Hit,This is going to be 1 of the greatest games ever. All the other Zelda games were very good. THIS 1 IS GOING 2 BE GREAT!
4,Four Swords NGC,"I played this game with my nephew which required 2 GBAs and 2 link cables. No problem. The game worked in such a way that he controlled two Links and I controlled two. Knowing that much, the game uses GameCube to GBA connectivity pretty well and is probably the best I've seen thus far. I don't know whether I would have played this game as a single-player since it was mainly designed to attract the multi-player crowd, but after beating it once, I haven't played it again (there are no ""side quests"" or anything else to bring you back into the game). Nonetheless, a very good purchase for the multi-player crowd but single-player can do just fine (I had to switch to single-player to pass some traps, but again, not sure if I would purchase it for this). Great for a zelda collector."
4,This Legend is Awesome,"My dad just bought me this game and I have the review for the original GBA game. I just want to tell you this game is great!!! The graphics are much like the Legend of Zelda Wind Waker and the overlay is much like Zelda Link to the Past. The control of four Links is really cool. You will have to find ways to beat some of the bosses in using the different patterns (Diamond, square, straight line) and the really cool thing is if you go into a dungeon or a house the screen goes to the GBA and you can play through that screen. COOL NINTENDO keep up the good work"
4,A Classic Continued,"Even though I haven't played it yet it looks very cool. I think my favorite part will be being able to play 1-4 players simultaneously. The bad thing is that to play 2-4 you need a GBA link for GC and a GBA for each player. But one good thing is that you get a free GBA link at toysRus if you get the game. The Four Swords Adventurers will be exiting, fun, and very entertaining. This will be worth 50 bucks!!!"
4,Going to be great.,"Although this game has not been released yet, it is sure to be a hit among all Zelda fans. Now the dream of going all out against each other as Link can be lived out. This game will offer an oppertunity for you and 3 friends to work together in order to save Hyrule. This game will be similar to Final Fantasy: Chrystal Chronicals, and Warioware: Mega Microgame$; two other great party games. The ability to link your Game Boy Advance to the Gamecube will be required in multiplayer mode to uncover secrets and extras that you and only you can see on your personal Game Boy. Prove to your friends that you are not the weakest link with Zelda: Four Swords for Nintendo Gamecube."
4,This is just one of those games you got to have!,"I can assure you this new Zelda game will make a great big splash when it comes out on June the 7th, it will be the first ever multyplayer Zelda game that you can play on the Nintendo Game Cube!!!!!As i just said it will have a multyplayer mode and a solo mode too so now you can finaly experience the fun and glory of a Zelda game with your friends, but if you'll want to play this game in multyplayer you'll need 1game boy advance with 1game link cable for each player, you'll be able to hook up to 4 players.So remember if you like adventure games and multyplayer games too this game is right for you!"
2,"Nothing like it since. . . .er, Paper Mario!!!!!","This is adorably cute. It does have many of the basic Zelda memes in place. . . .Grandma in her house, burning bushes, sparkling gems, green-clad Link. . . .but it's two-dimensional, arcade-style gaming. If you're looking for the outstandingly sophisticated Link, Hero of Time adventures seen in the last few years-- this isn't it. Ideal for four Game-Boy-equipped middle-schoolers at a sleepover. Adults are unlikely to enjoy it."
2,Unbelievably not worth it!,"Yes, there are die-hard Zelda fans that will defend this game to the end, but if you're not a kid with 3 friends, all of whom have GBAs (+ link cables), and have played at least one other Zelda game, you're likely to HATE this game.CHALLENGE. It's easy and redundant--you see all the possible bad guys in the first few levels of the game (if you don't already know them from older games), and they're all ridiculously easy to beat.ADVENTURE. There's basically no adventure to Four Swords Adventures b/c the game is most linear w/very few extras to ""discover.""I'll spare you my feminist tirade on the role of the women in this game, but I will say that the problem's less annoying then in Windwaker--until the end when Zelda kept dying on me. Wait till the next Zelda game."
2,huge letdown,"this does not play like any of the zelda series games. first of all, its a level based system. you go through for about 45 mintues collecting things that you cant keep.....you read that correctly....YOU CANT KEEP!!! you pick up a boomerang and you lose a bow and arrow. rediculous. back to the point, you go through levels. sure it has a story line, but i dont want the game dictated how i should play. thats what i loved the most about the zelda games. sure it keeps the same zelda play, which is fun, but overall this game is a huge letdown if you are expecting previous zelda games."
3,"Easy, but fun while it lasted","I just finished the Four Swords Adventure and I enjoyed playing it for the most part. I only found two parts of the game challenging, but once the puzzle was solved I realized that it wasn't as hard as I was making it. The game is extremely linear and I found that to be very annoying. However, it was still fun to play for a half an hour here and there."
3,If you like the puzzles you'll like it,"My 4 year old and I finished this game in 2 weeks. I am NOT what you'd call a Nintendo guru or anything. We have all of the Zelda games and this is BY FAR the easiest. If you enjoy the zelda games for the plots, fighting and game experience, you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy the Zelda games for the puzzles, you'll enjoy it completely. I am very happy that finally once you get rid of things they are gone and don't come back when you re-enter the room. And I enjoyed all the puzzle games. But if I can beat all the bosses....anyone can."
2,"Be warned, it's got 2-D graphics","I probably should have known this before buying the game, but I didn't and it was a HUGE disappointment. I was never a fan of video games until my little brother got the Nintendo 64 and I discovered the 3-d graphics. From that moment on I've been a huge fan of the Zelda games among others. But to my horror, this game is 2D and the graphics are less than spectacular. I have not actually played the game and I will give it a shot, but if you are like me, think twice before buying this game. Also, I don't own a gameboy, much less two, so I don't know if I'll get to play the multiplayer game. I knew this before buying the game, of course, but I still think that having to buy a game boy per player is a rip off. My guess would be that if the people at Nintendo had wanted to let the first player use the regular gamecube controler, they could have set it up that way. It's like the Tingle Tuner in The Wind Waker. Just another clever marketing gimmick."
1,What is this junk,Ok I have played tons of zelda games and this is junk how can Nintendo do so bad this game is to easy took me about 5 hours to beat and all you do is press the B button and the bad guys die that fast this is just not a good game. Go buy a better game like tales of symphonia that games the best if you are like 5-8 this game (zelda four swords) is ok but any older it just not worth your money good thing my freind bought it and let me play. Game play it the worst it nothing like the old zelda game like OOT or MM this is just like a game boy Adv zelda game but you pay alot more.Over all this is a peace of junk sorry nintendo but I know you can do better next time.
3,Absolutely Awesome - if you have 4 Gameboys,"If you know no one else with a gameboy advance - this game is just ok. However, If you DO have friends that have gba's then this game is really awesome and a ton of fun. The multiplayer aspect is really neat. The other downside is the graphics are pretty bad - but that's because it has to work with the gba."
4,I Love Zelda,"I love all the zelda games, and somehow this one got by. I enjoy trying them by myself and then using a walkthrough if needed."
3,"very fun, very short",this game lasted me about 4-6 hours on my first play though. i played with a friend about 1 hour was spent between the two of us fighting each other :) not enough game in this game to justify the price.
2,A Disappointment,"Following the Windwaker release - this game is a real let-down. The graphics aren't there ( I know they are retro , but, so what...) - the gameplay is tedious. There is no feeling of mystery or wonder. Even my 9 year old kid won't play it with me. This game is way overpriced for the value received. Wait until it goes for around $10 - then it could be worth a few hours of your time."
4,Yummy Lattes!,I love this machine because it was one of the first ones out that could make a latte. My only complaint is how expensive the pods are and that they are hard to find in most stores. I believe target just started carrying the pods though.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I got this coffe maker as a gift, and although it claims to make a cup of coffee in one minute, I find that it's taking 5 minutes for the water to heat before I can brew it. I like my coffee on the weak side, so it's taking another 5 minutes to heat the water again before I can manually add more water! Perhaps it's just my machine that has the problem? Also, it's pretty noisy; I won't be using it before the kids get up in the morning."
5,Like a vending machine for coffee and cappachino drinkers!,"This is quite a novel machine, it makes individual cups of selected beverages, coffee, cappachino, hot cocoa... The coffe, cappachino, and hot cocoa come in individual serving tubs that load directly into the machine. Two button pushes later, and about 1 minute, you have a very hot cup of delight. This is a novel machine, but do to the small water caraffe, it's limited in serving for a dinner party or family event, although the convenience factor outweights those cons. For everyday use, I probably would still with my regular pot brewing coffee maker, I can see where the premeasured drink tubs would be very costly. I was pleasantly surprised how delicous the coffee and cappachino were, very rich and smooth tasting."
5,Super Machine!,"I bought this for the office and am so pleased I'm getting another for the house! Quick, simple, and a pleasant cup of coffee every time (I've just tried the Gevalia Signature). All my co-workers think it makes a great cup as well! A BIG hit!"
4,"Almost perfect, but not quite","It looks great and the engineering is quite simple to figure out. However, the t-discs are very expensive and you need to use at least 2 at a time to get a 6oz. cup of coffee. It also takes a long time to heat up. I also own a Senseo and think it`s a great inexpensive machine."
2,Can not contact customer service,My Tassimo will not puncher the disks. All i get is hot water. Is ther a repair kit
5,Fantastic machine!!!,Got this for my girlfriend. At first she wasn't too warm to it. Now she can't get enough. She loves this machine. It makes the greatest coffee. I'm not even a coffee drinker and I love it. I've started to drink coffee myself The only complaint I would have is the machine is a little noisy but it is fast and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone who loves Starbucks or specialty drinks. Worth the price.
5,"Sor---rr--ry, i'm sha-aa-ky....","I'm blaming the Tassimo. Convenient, great coffee, & looks good on the counter. Just too easy to throw in a disc, push a button, listen to the engine (which I like), and then walk away with my order. What other maker has a bar-code reader? It is noisy compared to drip, as, pump vibrates like an aquarium pump on roids & the milky bevs require 2 passes: coffe disc, then, the milk disc. I've tried the Senseo too & I like this one mucho better, esp w/ rebate!! For the price range, this machine rocks. Maybe was ref before, but for review from the experts: [...]"
1,Terrible Quality - Wait For New Bosch-Designed Machines,"Had the machine for almost one month when it died. Called Tassimo USA and they sent a shipping box and label (about three weeks later) for me to return coffee maker for repair. (Repair is done by a third-party in San Francisco.) Sent machine. Month later got the same machine returned to me, ""repaired"". Used it for two weeks when it died again. Same problem as before. Called Tassimo and they said same thing: We'll send you a shipping box and label to send it in for repair. Nope. Time to trash this machine and wait for the new Bosch-designed Tassimo machines to be available in September. These machines from Braun are just trash. Don't waste your month; wait for the new machines from Bosch."
1,"I am not impressed, and I own 5 coffee makers","I am not impressed my the Tassimo products. The coffee variety all seems to taste the same. The machine itself is noisy and doesn't make very much coffee - no matter what Disc you use.I got a Late assortment with a milk pod, and the pod leaks milk all over inside the top Disc area, so it has to be cleaned every time. That is a pain.I have a Keurig K-Cup machine and a Senseo podmaker too. I would recommend either of these machines over any Tassimo machine. The Keurig makes awesome coffee and the selection is impressive."
1,EJ Howard,"I just had to have this product...couldn't even wait to see if I would get it for Christmas. I have been looking in all the stores to find the best price. Well, I ordered it and also ordered alot of the coffee. It makes the worst coffee I have ever had, very, very strong. I have tried it all week with different coffees it is awful...I am so upset that I spent the money on this product. I will use the coffee up then this will go in a garage sale"
1,Braun Tassimo TA1200 - defective,Received this product from you and it was defective.Called Tassimo and they did trouble shooting with me andsaid it was defective. It wouldn't work. Had to return it.Disappointed.
5,Loving it!,"I've had the Tassimo for a few weeks now, and I'm loving being able to get good coffee at the push of a button. Part of the reason I chose Tassimo is because of the selection of the coffee. I bought a bunch of different types and am enjoying trying them out. Also, the mail-direct program keeps me well-stocked."
5,Excellent Machine!,"We Love our Tassimo! We own a small business and work out of our home, so this is the perfect coffee maker for us. We've tried every single T-disc you offer and love them all!"
4,WORKHORSE,Having bought this unit first I came to really love this; but the variety of products seemed to be decreasing. I then bought a Keurig; which is good but so termpermental my Tassimo still works and I have already been thru one Keurig already and am on the verge of another. I wish there was more variety in Tassimo's beverages and a way to adjust size; these coffeemakers are dependable and are like the energizer bunny............never quit.
5,SENSITIVE MUSIC ONLY FOR SENSITIVES SKINS,"Esteban Sanchez plays in a wonderful way for this CD (as he always plays). It is necessary the opinion would be showed by only people who feel his hands performances, this only hands for the music history. From Spain where all the people find out the most closely knowing about his performance and repertoire."
2,good for ONCE ONLY,"i bought this CD quite some time ago thinking that this should be really good, as alfred cortot himself gave praise to esteban sanchez's playing. after listening once i was impressed. after listening a second time, i felt like turning the stereo off halfway. sanchez is not a well-established pianist and there is good reason for that. if he does rubato or allargando or something like that (means playing around slightly with the tempo), he does it EXACTLY THE SAME EVERY TIME! after a while i just can't help but say ""oh here we go again"". yes. his playing is THAT predictable: i know he's going to do something before he even does it. it sounds pretty nice at first, but after a while u will feel that u really shouldn't have wasted your money on this. get the early laroccha one or the one by nicholas unwin. those are much better."
3,"Enjoyable, if you don't expect too much.","This book isn't great literature and doesn't claim to be, but it's fine for a lazy afternoon when you just want something to read. It's the kind of book you can enjoy but forget you read a year from now. It also has what you might expect: a plot based on a string of incredible coincidences and 'not-very-deep' characters (I found myself actually hoping that the bad guys would snuff-out the heroine at one point just to shut her up). It provided a pleasant diversion for a few hours which is all I really expected."
3,Frey should quit while ahead,"Sorry, but a book of card board cut outs, washington defense cliches and simplistic dialogue seems a poor third novel for Frey. For those who say they couldn't put it down, a real page turner, what do they usually read--the telephone book?"
1,The plot saves it...just barely.,"I'm a Stephen Frey fan, so bear with me. This was a stinker...a financial thriller version of 'The Firm.' Not nearly as good as The Takeover or Vulture Fund. Why? Unrealistic and grossly cliched dialogue and description primarily.For instance: Pierce, a military guy, is described as ""steely-eyed"" and with ""ramrod"" bearing. Characters are always ""interjecting"" or ""replying"" or ""shooting back"" or ""interrupting"" or ""uttering"" as opposed to just ""he said."" And the redundancies: ""...he murmured quietly"" (how else?) and ""it was a Manichaean struggle between good and evil"" (is there any other kind?). And the cliches: She was ""like a cat on a hot tin roof trying to get off."" Actually, I fault Frey's Dutton editor on this (you can see who she is in the acknowledgments section), because this book has a complex plot and fast-paced story, and Frey pulls it off, albeit just barely. I'm a fan. I'll give him another shot."
4,Better then the reviews given here......,"If you like Stephen Frey then you will enjoy this book. I've read most of his books and this would rank toward the top. Sure the other reviews complain about depth of characters and a somewhat unbelievable plot but that is Frey. Lots of action, lots of twists and lots of fun. That is what Frey is about. As I always end: Remember, get this book from your library and save your cash."
4,"Oddly uneven, but good.","There's more realism here than most would like I think. One of the problems for many people is that they don't move in those circles where people really do talk to each other like little-lord-fauntleroy. So I think that many people are put off by what they see as unrealistic when it is completely realistic.This is a combination of slice of life from that class, with some imaginative stuff. But this is not the potboiler that many are saying."
3,"Good read, but not his best","This is an enjoyable book, although not Frey's best. This book will take you through many twists and turns in a fast paced action thriller. It's definitely worth reading, but don't get your hopes up too high -- especially if you are expecting a thriller to match his book The Takeover."
5,one of the best political/business thrillers,A great book written by a great professional storyteller. You can feel the authors background of the world of business. I've had a great time with this book and for Germans it's a great view into the American way of politics and business. Thank You for this wonderfull thriller and I'll read also the other books of Mr. Frey.
1,Three months,"This book took me close to three months to read it whereas usually I can finish a good book in a few days. I would go weeks without reading this. The only thing that kept me going is my stubborness that I finish every book I start, no matter how boring. After reading The Vulture Fund and The Takeover I eagerly looked forward to this book. Boy, was I disappointed. Save your money and your time."
2,Frey's out of the pan and into the first on this one.,"It's unfortunate that so many writers, who have had some success, suddenly lose their touch. That's certainly the case with Stephen Frey's latest book, The Inner Sanctum. His two previous books were fairly well developed and rather interesting books based on his knowledge of the financial community. But he's totally off base on this one. An unbelievable plot (even for thriller authors) and wooden characters make this book one that can be passed up."
2,Not Frey at his best,I really enjoyed both The Takeover and The Vulture Fund but this book was really a disappointment. The best part was the few pages of The Legacy included at the back of the book. Hope Frey returns to his previous form soon.
2,Boring and utterly predictable,"I have to agree with most of the other folks whose reviews appear here...the book read like a made-for-tv movie, and not a very good one at that. Boring and predictable, I found myself rolling my eyes as I progressed from one absurd scene to the next. Not a good book."
1,"This book is pathetic, an immense waste of time","Truman Capote once said ""A writer goes through three stages: Learning his craft, producing his best work...and typing."" We've seen it with Ludlum, King and others, Frey breaks new records by reaching the ""typing"" stage in his third book. Wholly unbelievable dialogue,stunningly obvious plot (especially for a ""thriller""), lookalike character cliches, etc.In a word? Boring."
1,Not worth the time to buy,I won't even write a long review. It is just a waste of time. The video is boring and I lost interest midway through it. The sad thing is that I ordered many of her DVD's at once. So now I am stuck with them... Or maybe I can re-wrap - what do you think? LOL.I ended up buying tons of straight cookbooks after this lousy experience. Her cooking tips and suggestions are not that helpful. The recipes are not practical and its just a hot mess altogether. Don't waste your time or money like I did.... RUN AWAY FAST!!!!!
1,Do Not Buy,"It doesn't work. I hooked it up, and lost all my data on my external hard drive after installing this product. DO NOT BUY. Very disappointing."
1,Poor quality,"It didn't work. When I try to transfer video from my Camcorder to my laptop, there is no image neither sound in my lap. According to the manufacturer's laptop technical support staff, the problem is with the cheapest cards. I stongly recommend to buy a well known brand name card."
1,Wrong Item,I thought my laptop used pcmcia cards because it had a place that they would fit (well sort of). Well that was wrong so have no use for the item ordered. Not your fault should have checked first. Only wish I had checked first.
3,works good on a g3 macbook,"I purchased this unit slightly more than a year ago (didn't get around to writing a review until now). so far, this card works nicely under OS X 10.3.9 on an old G3 Macbook (lombard). I use it for transferring video from my sony DCR-HC52 to the macbook for video editing. So far, I have had no problems with it whatsoever. never tried it on a windows based system, so I have no idea how well it works there."
1,terrible product & service,I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED FROM TIGER.IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED AND TO RETURN IT WOULD COST ME MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT.THE COMPANY CHARGES TOOOOO MANY FEES.I AM VERY UNHAPPY & NOW I HAVE A PRODUCT THAT I CAN'T USE OR RETURN.
1,"'Alimentary, my dear Watson.'","I concur with the other skeptical reviewers. As with most of Lyall Watson's work, wherever there is undisputed evidence of a strange phenomenon, there is nothing paranormal going on; where paranormal claims are made, there is no good evidence. Supernature is mostly a catalogue of unsupported speculation from cover to cover. Space here doesn't allow me to go into details, but I've written a more considered review at:http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Supermix.htm"
4,Great DVD for Beginners,This DVD is great if you are a beginner. I am more into the advanced work outs and I am used to sweating within ten minutes however I didnt break much of a sweat until twenty miutes into the dvd. Dont get me wrong this is a great warm up dvd for the hard core people such as myself and this is great for those who want a quick workout. She has a great ten minute bun feature on the DVD and you even have the option of just working out to the music once you get the routine down. Thats a plus. The reason I havn't given it five stars is because at the beginning of the dvd there is a two minute infomercial that you cannot fast forward through or even skip. You have to play that part to actually get to the workout. That is very annoying. I dont like being forced to watch an infomercial especially when its on something I paid for.
2,Over Rated,"This is not one for the uncoordinated. I only tried it once, and have no desire to try it again. Also beware that this is not the best pick if you have only a small space."
4,A thriller to rejoice in,"Bob Dave's Run to the Sun bears the hallmarks of a writer who knows his background material so well (places, courtroom types, psychology) that he carries the reader along absolutely convincingly. I particularly like his precision of topograpgy, both in Hawaii and on the Mainland; his places enrich his narrative in a way that makes this, his first novel, truly a tour de force. He has the enviable ability to get inside his characters' thinking (hardly surprising: he's a psychologist after all) and make even the apparently far-fetched seem plausible.He writes intelligently for the intelligent reader and has added an excellent piece of fiction to the suspense genre. I look with eagerness for his next book."
1,A real disappointment,"Laughably bad dialogue, characters that are only one-dimensional caricatures, and a plot full of holes large enough to fly a 747 through make this one of the worst reads I've endured in years. The gee-whiz writing style in Run to the Sun has more in common with the Sweet Valley High series than the John Grisham thriller it's attempting to be."
2,Run to...or From it?,"I bought this as ""beach reading"" for a trip to Hawaii and found it perfectly good for that purpose. I was engrossed in the story. I found the references to the female foil of the protagonist immature; it seemed to be the authors own way of living out an adolescent male fantasy with a female via the leading character and I was wondering more about the authors pyschological well being as much as I was about the characters in the book. I bought the book based on very warm reviews and was disappointed that the book didn't come through for me as strongly. There are better mysteries out there."
1,Great Imagination - Writing Skills Need Work,"Robert Dave's first novel is a grand attempt by this newly published author. I give him an A+ for his persistence of effort. Run to the Sun is complex storyline, with twists and turns that are bogged down with the use of cliches and forced leaps for which the reader has to constantly make excuses. I gave this novel until page 108 when Mr. Dave used the term ""Three Muskateers"" (a cliche) that proved to me for approximately the 50th time in 108 pages that the author took the easy way out. I would be willing to read his next novel because I feel that he has potential and will become a good writer/storyteller with practice. Skip this one fellow readers but be willing to read his next."
3,Tittle is Misleading,"I bought the book believing it tobe a complete account of Jochen Piper's military career. Even though the details about the Ardennes campaign and the drive to the Meuse are impressive the book says few about Piper's career in Russia. I wanted to know how the Blowtorch Battaillon in Piper's command won its fearful reputation in Russia, about his aggresive tactics with half tracks and his innovative style of commnad that has been praised in numerous accounts. About this I didn't learn something new in this account but it is a very good book about the KG Piper's actions during the Battle of the Bulge. The tittle of the book is a little bit misleading as it does not center in Piper's career or biography and is more a historic account of the Battle of the Bulge. I gave it 3 stars for that, if some chapters were dedicated to Piper's previous career in Russia which accounts for most of his exploits and fame I would have improved my rating."
2,Bad Title taints this book,"In my opinion one should be able to read a title and at least get an idea about the main topic of the book. Not so here.If you want an moment-by-momentbreakdown of the Battle of the Bulge then this book is for you. If you want to learn anything about Jochen Peiper, his mind, motivations, style etc, you will be wasting your time. Peiper's name is invoked because he was a leader in the military thrust described by the author. There is no critical evaulation of why he's compelling, how he led, what were his values. We learn almost nothing about Peiper as an individual from this book. All I can take from this book about Peiper is: he was part of Himmler's staff, and since we all know how bad Himmler was it doesn't say good things about Peiper.Guilt-by-association won't work here; I need a lot more evidence to buy the argument."
4,Excellent account of Jochen Peiper during the Ardennes only,"I really don't have much to add to the earlier reviews and I agree with all the comments about Peiper's time on the Russian Front which I thought this book would cover in great detail. I was really looking forward to accounts of the fighting on the Russian front and although this book offers an excellent account of Peiper's role in the Ardennes Offensive I wanted more of his earlier involvement in the war. Besides that this is a great book and if you enjoy accounts of the 'Battle of the Bulge' you are bound to love this book. I am yet to read the author's second book ""Steel Inferno"" but I have only seen/heard great reviews so far."
3,Excellent history of Kampgruppe Peiper during late 44-45,"I agree with the above reviews in that the title is misleading in that very little is told of Peiper's experiences in Russia where his exploits were responsible for him being given such a major role in the Ardennes offensive.Nevertheless it is a fine history of the Kampgruppe Peiper's actions during the the period,in particular the small unit actions and the retreat of Peiper's survivors towards the end.More of a history of Kampgruppe Peiper than a detailed history of the man himself during WW2"
4,Real value is as a Battle of the Bulge reference.,"The strength of this book is as a reference relating to the Battle of the Bulge. It integrates both German and American unit histories, personal interviews, and soldier written publications with an eye towards combined arms/joint service operations (not just tanks and infantry; but artillery, air power, engineers, logistics, etc.) Reynolds was a professional military officer serving in Europe. He knows the terrain, tactics, and emotions of battle. It may not be the most exciting tale; but it is surely one of the most complete battle analysis I've read."
3,a little less than I expected,This biography of Jochen Pieper is less than I expected. I frankly do not care for the author's writing style and trying to find facts in the index is difficult. I did like the way he presented the various perceptions of the Malmedy Massacre. I believe there could have been more documentation. I prefer Patrick Agte's biography more.
4,"Battle of the Bulge, not Peipers biography","Reading this book you would never believe the German attack held any real threat to the Western front or Allied Forces. This book has much more to do with the Battle of the Bulge than with Peiper. Breif rundown on his younger years, and some to do with being Himmler's Adjutant, and a post war chapter as well, but mostly about the Bulge. Interesting accounts of the fighting, and a good read for anybody who is interested in the conflict. Not as much first person accounts as I would have liked, but the author certainly did a lot of research putting this together and I am sure its history is as near correct as you will ever find on the battle."
2,Peiper deserves better,"Reynold's book is a seriuosly flawed exercise in portraying one of the greatest, and certainly most charismatic regimental commanders of the Waffen SS. Coverage of his Kampfgruppe during the Battle of the Bulge is meticulous, but other than that there's only a very superficial treatment of Peiper's career, personality and achievements, especially in Russia where he made his name. A true patriot and convinced national socialist, he is the shining example to future generations"
5,A Must Read for GSD owners,This is the only book I've found for German Shepherd owners that really speaks to the breed and its needs. Tremendously helpful!! Can't wait to read Cree's book on Training GSDs.
5,A Cooking Autobiography,"This is a wonderful look back by the author. He looks at his life in the Northwest and the foods that brought solace. How they were prepared and how the foods intertwined with daily life in the Beard household. Beard reveals his ""delights and prejudices"" for and against certain foods, methods Etc. This book made me think back to my childhood and the foods we would cook as the seasons came and went. Fresh game, fruits local to our area...I could almost smell the wild strawberries as Beard described them. I sure wish this book was back in print but try to find it if you can. It's a real gem!"
5,The best!,Our first baby toothpaste was rated safe but had no mint flavor. My daughter loves mint and recently stopped cooperating in brushing because she was teething all the time. This toothpaste is also safe so I ordered it for her. Since we received it there was no time when she refused to open her mouth to brush her teeth. Tastes nice and cleans well. We are both happy with it!
5,Great Product!!,I am very satisfied with this toothpaste. I was searching for one for my 19 month old son and wanted something as natural as possible without flouride. My son loves the taste of it too.
4,the digital empire is the phutur,"The phuturism album has a premium sound that rocks from the beginning of the first cd to the end of the second. The big names caught my eye, and the sounds were better than I expected. Great album for what I paid."
2,Bland!,"The reason I picked up this CD was because of the few good artists listed on the back. I have been listening to Trance/House/Progressive for quite some time now, but this is the worst compilation of tunes I've heard in a while. I expected this album to have energy and power. None of these songs will get your party jumping. The only reason I give this album a 2 is because they chose a few good artists, and they didn't screw up ""Battersea"" by Hooverphonic. Pick up some Sasha, Oakenfold, or BT. They won't disappoint you."
1,Poor form all around,"To start, I received no instructions. After three irritating phone calls, I was pointed to online PDF versions. Thanks for not forcing me to call you three times since I have all the free time in the world to sit on hold. One week later, the frame broke because two people were sitting on one-half of the futon. Clearly this is not made to handle much weight at all. Realize you're getting a one person futon, that's it.Now the true test is how they will handle my complaints. Their customer service thus far has been very very poor, I hope they can rememdy my new broken futon soon otherwise the name Cymax will be associated with bad, regardless of whatever alliance produced the crappy thing. Someone better stand by this deal."
5,Great Frame,Arrived faster then expected. Easy to put together(did it by myself) this is really a beautiful frame I love it.
3,Better values elsewhere,"Product came with no assembly instructions. Had to contact the company to get a pdf file for assembly. Parts did not match exactly the instructions. Found virtually the same product at Walmart under a different name for $100 less with more support for the cross supports. Would be reluctant to buy from this company again. The product does look ok but for the cost after looking at the parts, a good value should have included the mattress."
4,Great!,"Bought this for a small room we use as an office/spare bedroom. Fits well and looks good. Only complaints are: 1) the instructions weren't all that specific (it was hard to tell which screws to use, etc) and 2) the wood got scratched while trying to install the metal. Otherwise, we're happy with it."
2,Poor quality,Wood split within 6 months of owning.This is not a quality product.Comfort - poor.Owned a cheap 99 dollar futon w/mattress duringcollege years that held up for 4+ years.
1,No Instructions!,"This futon looks really nice online and it's listed at an excellent price, however, it arrived with NO INSTRUCTIONS! Yes, that's right....no instructions. Amazon takes no responsibility because it was through Cymax. Cymax takes no responsibility because it was shipeed through the manufacturer, AFA3. After several emails, online chats with customer service, and hours on the phone, I have been directed to go to the website and find a pdf file.I really regret ordering this and wish I had gone with one of the other options.Just wanted to warn everyone.....don't expect assembly directions if you order this product!!!"
5,"Simple assembly, Good quality",My husband and I assembled this in a relatively short amount of time (and I'm 8 months pregnant). We use it as a sofa/guest bed in our very small office. It is a stylish frame and of good quality. It surpassed my expectations of a futon which was primarily based on experiences with cheap college furniture. I would definitely recommend this if you do not have enough room for a traditional mattress bed.
2,"Doesn't stretch, and leaks frequently","I bought a big box of this things,always regretted it since then. Since it doesn't stretch, it doesn't fit very well. It leaks more than any other diapers I have tried. Even the Pampers Swaddlers from the same manufacturer works much better."
1,Defective Game,"I concur with the other reviews. This game has an annoying defect. I went so far as to contact tech support. This is what I was told.""Response (Jason) - 04/10/2006 11:50 AMUnfortunately, this is a known problem with the game that will occur when there is less than a 40% charge on the battery. We have already notified the developer of the game about the problem, but since the problem does not prevent a player from completing the game, the decision was made to not fix the problem. At this time, the only solution that I can offer you is to make sure that you have charged your battery as much as possible before playing.""However, this problem manifests itself after about 15 - 20 minutes or approximately 90% charge and not 40%. Most annoying is that Ubisoft is continuing to sell a knowingly defective product. Seems like there are laws against that.This could be a fun game but the bug precludes that. Even if you feel this wouldn't bother you, I would not give them your money on principle."
2,I agree and ...,"I totally agree with all that was previously said, and when that pop-up comes up the time continues to tick away.. which is the MOST annoying ever. you would think that if the program was busy loading it would freeze the game but it doesn't. The time just keeps on going unless you pause the game everytime the pop-up shows up. So obnoxious. Other than all that bs, the game is pretty good, except that it tells you when you have misplaced a #. Not cool. Maybe I'll just stick with the good old piece of paper sudoku."
1,Good game with fatal flaws,"As the reviewer below said, it will tell you as soon as you make a wrong move. This significantly reduce the challenge.Even worse, about every 45 to 60 seconds while you are playing an Attention alert comes up covering most of the screen telling you to wait. After 10 seconds or so it goes away. This is very irritating !I am looking forward to someone doing Sudoku right for the PSP."
2,Has serious flaws,"As an addict of sudoku games, this game came as a disappointment. This game biggest flaw is the inexplicable loading screen. Why does it need to load so much. These loading skill happen so often that the interrupt the momentum of the game. I was so disgusted with the game that I did something I have never done, I threw it away. It wasn't even worth it for me to try and resell it. Avoid this game."
2,"Loading, please wait....",Great game with very nice graphics and tons of puzzels HOWEVER game auto saves (nonstop) during game play for 15-20 seconds at a time; WHY!?!? That has been the only major draw back as it auto saves approx every three minutes for some reason. Too bad really.
1,Glitch with Sudoku,"I agree with the other reviews. The game itself is fun and challenging but there is a terrible glitch in the programming. Ubisoft, please hear our voices and fix this problem.It is very irritating that the ""Attention"" screen pops up in the middle of a game for no reason at all. It was so annoying that I had to go buy the Nintendo DS version of the game instead."
4,an accurate geographic view,"living in Swansea, where King Philips War started I found the descriptions of where these events took place very interesting from a geographical point of view.I have visited most of the sites of this conflict and hold them in renewed reverence to the people of both sides of this bloody war, each fighting desperately for survival. Although this book was written in the 1950's and is skewed in favor of the english colonists, I felt nothing but sorrow for the demise of Philip and WampanoagIndians who fought desperately for there homeland. Viewed from the perspective of 375 years I felt shame at the permanent destruction of these native americans meted out by our ancestors."
4,The White Man's account of the New England Indian Wars,"Research done before the death of Nan Apashamen, Wampanoag historian of Plymouth Plantation in Massachusetts lead Nan to believe that King Philip, so named by the settlers to honor Massasoit's sons, was in fact the son of Alexander, or Wamsutta, the elder brother. This book is a pretty detailed account of the Indian wars from the settler's perspective but because of the lack of written indian records, not all the information can be held to be 100% reliable. It is in this war that the settlers introduced the practice of scalping as a means of verifying indian kills and each scalp offered resulted in a monetary award by the government."
3,Good Book,An informative book that was well written but with a 1950's view of Native Americans. The question that always arises with any conflict involving the Native American is why the Europeans do so poorly not what the Native Americans did well. However the book does give the reader a good glimpse into the time period and I believe the book is definitely worth reading.
3,good for it's time and perspective,"A decent book, although it is from a 1950's perspective and wholeheartedly views King Phillip's War as a courageous struggle of the colonies against the ""savages."" But detailed and interesting, especially for a native of Southeastern Massachusetts like myself."
4,Historically informative,"This book is historically accurate with many truths that used to be taught in our public schools before the political correctness ""mandate"". Revisionists will not care for this bit of history as it does not ""jive"" with THEIR version."
2,Weird sizing,"The sizing says 0-9, which is weird to begin with, but I'd put it at 6-9. There is no way my 4 month old will fit into this. It's a cute costume though. I just wish it had snaps instead of Velcro and was true to it's size. But really, what is 0-9?"
2,Not One Of Larry's Best Albums.,"So Long Ago The Garden followed on quickly from the fantastic Only Visiting This Planet.The cover is good, but the content, to my ears at least, is very disappointing.Good songs are Fly Fly Fly and Up In Canada.Nightmare #71 is greatly influenced by Bob Dylan and it works reasonably OK.Best track is Christmastime, a huge swipe at the commercialism of Christmas.Casual enquirers bewhere, other albums are of a far higher standard."
3,gift for mom,"This product seemed awesome at first, I even got a pick one (my mom and I both have all pink appliances) and it worked really well at first. Then around christmas when my mom was using it a lot black stuff started to come out of the bottom and ruined some cookie mixes. It seemed to be like oil or grease that makes it spin, but we dont know how to make that stop! it is also very powerful and if you are not careful you will have mix all over the kitchen!"
1,Horrible value,There were 6 stickers in this package. The picture looks like a roll of stickers so I was expecting 25 or 50 of these things. Six stickers...and they're not even that great. Hardley worth sending them back so I'll just use them.
5,A wealth of information,"This is a no nonsense book about how to get and stay healthy. Dr. Schwarzbein takes the principle she set forth in the first book and expands on it by explaining what you can expect as your body heals from years of poor nutrition and lifestyle habits. If you liked the first book, this book is a must. Even if you've never read the first book, Dr. Schwarzbein will walk you step by step through her healing program in the Schwarzbein Principle II. I've read it and am giving it to my friends for Christmas."
3,Buy the first book instead,"I love Dr Schwarzbein's first book - it has quite literally changed my life, resulting in vastly improved health. (It is certainly not ""Atkins with a twist"".) It's hard not evangelize! This second book has its merits, especially in showing us that one approach does not fit all. But it's not written as clearly as the first book, it's complicated, and it requires us to get tested to know what quadrant we fit into. I recommend the first book, and only this second one if you really want to dig deeper."
3,Reader from Marion MA,"I just picked up this book since having Dr. Schwarzbein referenced in Suzanne Somers' books and writing reciprocating forwards/testimonials for one another. Yet, even though I have not completely read Principle II, I have found this info to be confusing because it is the opposite principles compared to the Suzanne Somers' principles I have been strictly/religiously following since January 2003. I wanted to read this book to get the details on how Suzanne Somers' way of eating really works at the cellular level. Now I find that the two women's philosophies contradict each other. Can anyone explain how both claim to work and be so opposite??? It's hard for me to review this book since it's now telling me everything I'm been doing for almost six months is wrong and harmful to my health. Confused in Marion."
1,Similar to Atkins with a twist,"Very disappointed with this version, she has basically rehashed the same information as her first book and many others on the market. It is not particularly readable and too long. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,"The good, the bad and the ugly",My mom actually gained a lot of weight from this diet. I would not recommend it to anyone. It seems to be very simular to Dr. Atkins book with a little twist.
4,Sent as a gift,I have had the book for years and sent this to my sister. She was impressed as a medical dietician.
3,What's the Somers-Schwarzbein Connection?,"I, too, bought the first book and loved it. When number II came out, I bought three copies for family and friends. While it is true that this book is more comprehensive, and I enjoyed that, it is also repetitive and less well organized. Additionally, it has left me with a disturbing question: What is the Somers-Schwarzbein connection? Dr. Schwarzbein wrote the foreward to Suzanne Somers' book ""Get Skinny on Fabulous Food"" and Suzanne Somers wrote a testimonial for ""The Schwarzbein Principle II."" However, Schwarzbein's principles contradict Somers' ideas. For example, Somers says one should eat fruit alone whereas Schwarzbein says fruit should always be accompanied by protein and a good fat. And Schwarzbein doesn't believe in food combining which is at the core of Somers' program. What's going on here? Somebody please explain!"
2,Disappointed,I too loved Diana Schwarzbein's first book and have bought it as gifts and recommended to all my friends. This 'new' book leaves me flat and with nothing really new at all. Recommendation: buy the first book instead.
5,Favorite Mini horror series,I love horror books and movies and this is similar to tales from the crypt but a book and for children. The stories are more than satisfying and creepy. I love how unique the stories can get. Every story made my day and i enjoyed it very much so.
4,"Great workout, has everything!","I am a big fan of Jessica Smith, so I am partial to her portions of this dvd, but her costar gives you a good workout as well. Each segment is only 15 minutes so you can do one alone, or do them all together for a good workout. I wished the first kick boxing segment had some more kicking in it, but it still gets my heart rate up. Also, I would have enjoyed more stretching in the relaxing portion of the dvd instead of the slow movements that are karate inspired (I think), but that's just my preference."
3,Not too excited about this one...,I bought this product because my daughter was forming a flat spot on the back of her head due to being premature and extensive medical treatment. We traveled in the car quite a bit so I thought this may help the situation at least while she was in her car seat. I also thought this could be used in her swing. Use in the swing was fine. Use in the car seat caused a potentially dangerous situation as the 'nest' lifted her head quite a bit and provided nearly no side impact protection. I found myself adding rolled towels to each side of her head to give her the protection she needed.
2,Didn't seem to help...,"I purchased this item in hopes that it would help my daughter with avoiding the flat spot on the back of her head. Well, it happened anyway despite using this device everywhere. Her pediatrician said that some babies are prone to getting the flat spot, no matter what preventative measures are taken. Amazon delivered it quickly though and the price could not be beat.This item is well made and can stand up to wear and tear and many washings. This was the only place that I could even find this thing. Babies R Us had a velvet version, but I don't think that material is baby spit-up friendly."
5,Great Product,"I purchased this item after hearing about it from a friend. As a first time mom, I was very concerned that my son's head would be flat since he refused to sleep on anything but his back (I tried putting him to sleep on his side and turning him during his naps but he always reverted to his back). I used sleep positioners when he was in his crib, but when he was in the car seat, bouncer or swing I always utilized this. I think it is great and I highly recommend it to all my friends and family members."
5,Comfort and prevention,I put this under my baby's head when he is playing with his play gyms on the floor. It provides extra cushion and I like that it helps keep my son from having a flat spot.
1,Caused cone head on our infant - BEWARE!!!!!,We found out yesterday from our Pediatrician that this Noggin nest is causing a cone head on our infant. we had noticed a ridge on his skull the exact circumference of the round opening in this product. It must be recalled immediately. The doctor said this was the 2nd time he had seen this in a week.
3,So - So,"We were trying to purchase an infant head support that would support a tiny head, this head rest is much to large for an infant. The pillow section is not small enough to hold by daughter's head in place. Probably great for a toddler, not so good for an infant."
5,Best for prevention!,"This is a wonderful item to have for your baby. I call it a MUST HAVE! When I saw this when I was pregnant I bought it immediately, it defentially did the job. I never had to worry about my babies head going flat in the back, and now at 6 months old she has a beautiful round head. The cushion is also so comfortable, and really supports the head and neck. Great buy and a defentiate must have!!!!!!"
2,Useless for infants,"Okay, I got this for newborn. It's CLEARLY stated it can NOT be used for sleeping, remember that. In fact, my baby distinctly disliked it. Now, if you have any good car-seats, etc. they come with quite good head-rests, etc. Thus, I really didn't have a need for this. Also, infants really don't ""travel"" much for this to be useful, as it's only supposed to be used in strollers, car-seats, bouncers, etc. This is CLEARLY stated in their product tag on the product. Now, as the child grows older and the need rises for these products, i.e. strollers, car-seats, etc., does this product is still needed? NO! Why? As I see it, it's during the 1st. 6 months, that there's an urgent need to have something in place, helping the child's head in developing to a correct shape. Thus: I am not sure of the product's usefulness."
4,worthwhile purchase,"My sister-in-law bought me the common head positioners that fit inside the baby seats. (Usually a medium sized dark blue one with a smaller white one that fits inside of it) I appreciated her gift and while they kept his head from rocking back and forth while in his carrier, they did nothing to keep his head from throwing forward onto his chest. That was very disconcerting to me. The way his little head is cradled inside the noggin nest it keeps his head from throwing forward. The fact that it prevents the flat spot is just icing on the cake. I've also noticed much less crying since we purchased it, so I think it's safe to assume he's more comfortable. I only wish that it came in various colors. I don't care much for the denim blue. But, it is definitely worth having."
1,Do Not Use in Car Seat or Bed,"As a neonatal nurse, I have GREAT CONCERN that people will want to use this in their cribs or carseats.Although there is a warning not to use in a bed, I worry that many people will use this and it could cause death from potential suffocation.It is best not to add in any ""after market"" product to a carseat, including the packaged head rests that are found adjacent to the carseat aisle in the store. Only head rests that come included with your carseat - come out of the box with the seat should be used. Additional headrests cause bulk that prevent the straps not to be secured tightly enough over your child and bulk that can cause the baby's head to fall forward and occlude the baby's airway, i.e. cause the baby to turn blue!"
3,If Your Baby Will Stay On It,"Our baby's head started to get flat on the boppy about a month or so ago, and I found this, decided to try it as soon as we could get it. However, our daughter is really jumpy and active, and she just wont stay still on it when it is sitting free. She keeps sliding down off it, so it defeats the purpose of her sleeping or playing on it. It does work a lot better using it with things you can attach it to, like her glider and especially her car seat.Our baby doesn't like tummy time flat on her belly, only when resting on our chests and looking around, so I've been trying to keep alternating her head to the side when she lays down, but it doesn't seem to make a difference for her flat head. It doesn't look horrible and my husband says she will grow hair over her head anyway, but I want her head to fuse in a nice and comfortable position, so I will keep trying to gently mold it and keep pressure off it. Hopefully when she is a couple months older she will sit up and be okay."
2,A stretch!,I thought this book was a waste of my time. Very disappointed. If you are interested in psychic powers and talking to plants and animals this book is for you.
5,Excellent book!,"This is the fourth book I've read onthis subject and it is the best! Ms.Williams is extremely clear, thoroughand specific. I would recommend it toanyone interested in this subject, orinterested in animals in general."
2,It's not about horses!,"This book is not what I thought it was - I admit I did not read the content of the reviews - I just looked at the number of stars. Based on the beautiful cover, I assumed I was buying a book about horses. THIS IS NOT A HORSE BOOK! It is a book about animals, in general. Might be a good tool, if this is what you are looking for...but definitely not a book about horses."
1,Poor Customer Service,"It's the first time that I've had no replies to inquiries about a book order. Usually, other Amazon Merchants send an email acknowledging the order and giving a followup on when it was shipped. Nothing from this merchant. Had to cancel this one after 3 weeks of waiting."
5,Integrated Chinese Level 1 cd's,The cd's are good but the speakers tend to speak fast. It's hard when starting to keep up. They include everything they say they have in the books.
2,May be necessary companion to the textbook,"...but quality is very poor. Volume of the speakers fluctuates, sound quality is very poor, and the occasional vocabulary word being read by a different speaker lead to my dissappointment. It is far too expensive considering these quality flaws. But, this CD is necessary if you are using the Integrated Chinese textbook to study on your own, as it will provide the proper pronounciation using the words and dialogues in the textbook (the textbook itself is excellent). There are home-made podcasts for Chinese language students that are far better quality...and free."
3,Audio is kind of bad,"The audio is choppy and sometimes hard to understand. Speakers sometimes speak fast on all speeds whether slow, regular, or fast. Also speakers have different accents and makes for inconsistent pronunciation."
2,required for class,"if you don't need to buy this, don't. it'd be much nicer to have an interactive graphical and audio tool. it's hard to follow and not friendly for learning in this format. also the speakers tend to speak with a more neutralish tone."
1,Terrible Quality!,"The sound quality of these CDs is terrible. There's a lot of hiss, and the voices are muffled. I can't beleive they're selling these to the public! If you have to get these discs for class - there are many sources on the Internet where you can get the material on these discs for free."
3,Not enough practice space,"The characters are printed very clearly and neatly, however, there aren't enough practice boxes. The practice boxes with the dark dotted lines are also difficult to practice with (can't see what you write)"
4,Integrated Chinese: Level I part 2,This is an excellent book for classroom use or for studying with a tutor. i would have given it an even higher rank if it was possible to use this without outside instuction. It offers excellent preparation for certain specific parts of the the Chinese AP exam and is part of a series of very informative and well written study materials. An excellent choice for the more serious student of Chinese and should be part of your Chinese reference library.
5,Excellent Textbooks,"This series is very comprehensive and very well written. If the complementary materials are also used, then this series will teach and solidify your understanding of Chinese. The materials emphasize practical Chinese skills, taught for use in an everyday context, combined with the rigor necessary to memorize Chinese characters (if character workbook is also used)"
3,Not your typical studio quality,"If you are self-studying like me, you will need the CDs since you'll have to rely on the CDs for pronounciation.However, the quality of the CDs are not great.It's just enough to get the job done but nothing fancy.There are times when you can hear something else while the speaker is doing the narrative or pronounciation exercise. It is annoying and disruptive but what can you do..."
3,necessary for the text,"The cd set, for the price, is not bad. As it is absolutely necessary to have audio with Chinese study, it is well worth it to get this cd selection with the text. In my opinion, the text is pretty good, so shell out the extra few bucks and get the audio."
5,Learn it!,"This is the new standard for learning Chinese, and it works. Most decent Chinese language programs in universities are using the Integrated Chinese method. If you are taking the course in university, buy the CDs as a companion. If you are learning independently, you need to hear the language, and these CDs are effective. Good product."
2,Good purpose but too difficulty,"To be honest, I do not think it is a good textbook for self-learning, you will find it looks like a copybook."
2,Waiting and Waiting,Besides the eternity it took to arrive it was very choppy but i guess it helps a little...hope it helps in the middle of the semester =\
2,Antz Nest riddim,"Yo, what up to all reading this. To be to the point, if you a dj, mc, reggae enthuiast, love dancehall, BUY THIS! You would appreciate adding this to your already saturated reggae riddim collection. If you new to reggae, dancehall and all- there are MUCH more, need to say - much better riddims out there for you! Beenie comes through hot on this but cept for him and a few others dont really see big star power on this one. In dancehall terms- this one wont get much foward unless you play it to real diehards."
4,electric lightnin',"If you like your Lightnin' Hopkins electric, then this is the album for you. Plenty of great raw guitar licks coupled with the usual great Lightnin' storytelling. Lightnin' was an underated guitar player who never got as much attention as say Albert King or Hubert Sumlin, maybe because his style was rougher, but in my book he is the complete package as a songwriter/singer/guitarist. This is as good if not better than his acoustic recordings."
4,Good for dry skin,"Although I have very dry skin, I don't usually like creamy cleansers because they often don't wash off very well and I'm left with a filmy residue that doesn't feel moisturizing, just oily. However, I've been happy with Dove's cream cleanser. It removed dirt fairly well and rinsed off, although it took several splashes. And my skin did feel clean and soft. I also didn't feel like I need more moisturizer, which is nice in the summer when I have to put on sunscreen on top."
2,baster,"IT LOOKS REALLY COOL , I TRIED TO INJECT , HONEY INTO A HAM BUT THE NEEDLE KEPT GETTING CLOGGED, WITH NO EASY WAY TO CLEAN IT , THE NEEDLE SHOULD BE LARGER."
2,Cuispro Baster,"The baster is OK! Not as good as I expected.To baste my turkey, I had to remove the tip and use the base as is. Doesn't pick up the juices without doing this"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This baster never worked! The bulb is supposed to screw onto the baster, which is a nice idea and you would think it would work better than those that just slide on. However, the seal is terrible. There was absolutely no pressure no matter how many times we tried to rescrew it on. It wasn't even leaky like other basters I've tried, it just never took up any liquid. Do not buy."
1,Looks nice. Doesn't work.,"Neither of the tips on this baster does what it looks like it should do. The 'sprinkler' head just drips instead of showering. The injector tip doesn't inject anything. After I investigated this, I found out that you need an actual syringe to inject meat. Because basters don't have complete vacuums -- like syringes do -- this baster doesn't have the power necessary to inject fluids into meat.Lame. Why do companies make stuff they know won't/doesn't work?"
3,Not what I had thought,I was a little disappointed with the baster. It did not hold as much as the cheaper basters I have used nor did the 'shower' head work as well as I had thought. I ended up taking off the head. It took longer to bast my turkey than with other types of baster. If you have arthritis or carpel tunnel this is not for you! I am looking forward to using the injector head.
2,DOES. NOT. WORK.,"First time I used it, the threads in the baster attachment became stripped. I then tried the injector, which doesn't so much inject as it does puncture and flood. What appealed to me was the dual-purpose design of this baster, but the design is seriously flawed. Any time you have plastic threads that are less than millimeters wide, you're going to have issues - and I should have noticed that. If this baster, or any one for that matter, doesn't have an airtight seal, it won't draw fluids or hold them. Like those DVD/VHS players we used to have - great idea in theory, bad in practice.To echo a previous sentiment, how could a company like this put something that clearly does not work out on the market? I just don't get it."
1,Inferior product - didn't last one use,Looked great and was the only baster carried at my local Williams Sonoma store. Loved the transparent body w/ measurements and various end fittings. I knew I was in trouble when I tried to assemble it for the first (and only) time. I'm a professional manufacturing engineer and had trouble getting the fine threads to engage without cross threading. I did not cross thread. Even so the fully assemble unit could bearly suck any volume of liquid out of the pan. So knowing I had a vacuum leak I tightened the bulb and end fittings. Nothing worked. Eventually the rubber bulb came off of its cheap plastic neck insert which is probably where the initial leak was to begin with. I'm pretty frugal and would usually attempt a repair. Not in this case...RIGHT IN THE TRASH.
1,BULB Failure,"I thought I'd get what I paid for. Not so! The rubber bulb has failed after just a year. Troubling as it was probably used once on Thanksgiving. I was sure a ""screw-on"" bulb would be superior to a $2 baster. WRONG. 25 year warranty? Who has a receipt or registration card for a baster. If I get customer support from Cuisipro I'll change my review. In the mean time go to Walmart!"
2,It never worked right!,"I've had this for years and am finally getting rid of it after realizing every time I go to use it the bulb won't stay sealed and it never works. I didn't go to use it too often so I often thought it was the mix I was injecting...but no it's the item. I'm also slightly confused because it's threaded, but on the inside of the staff part where the bulb attaches, not the outside, so it doesn't actually screw into anything on the bulb. The needle does screw on. Save yourself the hassle, get something else."
3,Kindle version not viable,"This book illuminates a tragic flaw in the Kindle. Critical portions of the book such as source code listings and circuit diagrams are in graphical format (figures). The rendering of these crucial items is so small as to make them unreadable. The type size setting has no impact on these graphical objects. Selecting the object and using zoom is also of no help, as these objects are at or near the size of the kindle screen, so zoom doesn't make them larger. Such materials should be dropped from the Kindle store, or, ideally, Amazon should update the firmware to solve this serious deficiency - even a crude solution such as adding a more sophisticated zoom with a pan function would be a help. In the meantime, buy the print version, and let Amazon know that we want technical books for the Kindle that we can actually use, not money-wasting junk like this."
3,FLlW Arizona Reprised and Updated,"This is a steamlined re-telling of the Frank Lloyd Wright in Arizona story. But there is little detail beyond the Arizona Biltmore and Taliesin West. There are some nice late afternoon photos of T-West, but few of any other houses. The freshest images are of the recently constructed Arizona Capitol spire and an Apprentice shelter. Lawrence Cheek seems to have more distance than many FLlW book authors. The most interesting text is the last few pages of commentary on the FLlW franchise since Mr. Wright's death and in particular recent changes with Taliesin Architects and the FLlW Foundation.For the Arizona houses I would still recommend Storrer or FLlW's Western Work."
2,no significant one,"I don't find the significant design of FLW in Arizona. I think Taliesen will be his significant design, and the significant of Taliesen in Arizona, is the site plan. But, I don't find them in this book."
3,Too many typos,Too many typos in the practice exams (such as the upper-case 'I' in question 15 of Exam 1) make this a risky choice for the exam. You certainly don't need confusion when trying to study for this exam. The content is good though and it seems to targetthe necessary concepts.
1,No Parts Available ANYWHERE !,Stay away from Philips.... CAUTION.....No parts available to repair anything.
2,"Too sweet...and the flavor tastes ""off"" to me","Now that I'm stuck with 4 bags of this stuff, I'm trying to muscle through it (can't bring myself to throw it away)... but I really miss my old granola. This product is too sweet, and has another taste (vanilla?) that I can't quite place but I find distracting from what should just be a good granola taste. On a positive side, it's of good consistency and arrived tasting very fresh. But usually I just can't eat enough granola, and with this product I feel like I'm taking medicine - it's not tasty.I'm mixing this in with cereal... perhaps this granola would be better suited for baking. Sorry, I can't give this oatmeal my full endorsement."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. In fact, my husband and I barely read a chapter. We had read a review in SNIPS, a trade journal where it indicated that this was a true story. Not so. Although it may be based on a woman who is a sheet metal worker, which we looked forward to, it is infact fiction. In leafing through the book, there is much that we feel was put in for sensationalism. Too bad. Being a woman in a traditionally male world would have been suffecient to make the book interesting."
4,Pretty but hard to read,"We have the other version of this book (the neutral toned one.) We like that a bit better because it is easier to read. The writing in this book is in pink and is hard to read. I love that it is loose leaf so I can add to it, but the neutral book is written in darker colors and it stands out from the page. Each of these are kind of hard to see...."
4,Rockabilly Rock,"These cats are jumpin' a good variety of rock-a-billy songs and worth a listen.The Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
4,Product picture is misleading; this is a MUST HAVE,"The product picture doesn't show everything that comes with this kit. It also includes an S-Video/RCA cable that will connect the audio and s-video to your system. What it DOES NOT include is the fiber-optic digital audio cable which is a must have if you have a Dolby Digital AV system.I can't tell you how much better the sound is with Dolby Digital enabled. You've got to hear it to believe it.The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that you can't use one of the cheaper coax digital cables, but instead have to fork out another $ for the fiber optic cable."
4,A Must Have !,"I recently purchased the Xbox Advance AV pack. I have never heard a game in true 5.1 digital sound and wow its totally incredible. The only down side is that they make you buy a fiber optic cable,instead of giving you the choice of the digital coaxial which is relatively less expensive. I am also a little worried about losing sound quality running into in to the pack from my reciever. I'm not quite sure if I am losing quality in my sound or not. However if you have a dolby digital reciever or a tv with s-video it will make you feel like your in the game. One thing I did like though was the fact that they included the s-video cable."
5,Works more than great!,"I really love this Advanced AV Pack 'cause:1. The main cord is thicker than the original xbox cord, which makes it more durable and twist-resistant.2. It has an fiber optic out for audio that allows you to connect the xbox to a home theater or Audio component with optic fiber input (Not included)3. It includes the RCA and S-Video cables.In the end, you will have a good quality product with improved quality and sound.And basically thats it!"
3,Buy a XBOX Monster Cable Instead,"You're better off buying the Monster Cable for XBOX, a little more expensive but you'll have to buy a S-Video cable anyway to use with this one. The quality is superior because the Monster Cable goes directly from the XBOX to the TV, this one allows noise since you have to bridge two cables. The only thing better than S-Video is Composite HDTV which is also available from Monster Cable."
1,Stay with name brand,I purchased these batteries with the Opteka battery grip for my Canon XTi. After only a couple of recharges my camera started locking-up. I first thought my camera was the problem but after lots of troubleshooting with a Canon rep realized it was the batteries. The Camera and grip work fine with Canon batteries. Better to avoid cheap knock-offs. You really get what you pay for with these batteries.
4,"Searches the origin of racial hatred, focusing on community.","Pinderhughes uses his survey of teen-aged kids in New York City to describe and explain racial violence. His main theme suggests that the communities' attitudes shape the individuals' attitudes and beliefs. The most compelling evidence he uses are words straight from the youths' mouths. It is a well organized , easy to understand book."
3,does taste like macademia,"Price wise? I keep my extra virgen olive oil 2 liter ""first cold pressed"" $10.00 versus 16 oz macademia nut oil for $13.00"
5,Delicious on salads too!,I had bought this oil from another source but am happy to see that Amazon carries it at a competitive price! I just love it on salads and everything else!! I am a big fan of both Macadamia Oil and Macadamia Nuts so it seems right now that I am either eating the oil on salads or crunching on the nuts! Delicious!! And both are organic - a big plus to me!
4,Seems to be a good product.,I haven't used it more than once but I will. Seems like a very good product. I think it has a nice consistence.
2,Not 16 ounces,"I have ordered this product before and I love it! It has a great taste. However, I noticed the bottle wasn't quite full the last time but didn't think much about it. When I recieved my next shipment, the level of the oil was below the label. So, I decided to weigh the bottle. It was only 14 ounces. To give them the benefit of the doubt I went ahead and poured the contents out into a liquid measuring cup and again, just 14 ounces. Then of course I had to try and pour it back into the bottle, wasting an ounce. Great product but disappointed that it clearly states 16 ounces and it is not. I have sent the link for this product to several of my paleo friends lately too. I feel I need to warn them that they truly are not getting 16 ounces. :("
2,stale taste,This oil has a strange stale after taste. I have tried other macadamia nut oil that was much better. I used it to make mayonnaise.
2,HOW IS THIS OPEN AND WASTED IN PKG??,"I received this package today and the oil was spilt all in the bag?! Yet the seal was on, something very skeptical. I cant even say anything about the product because I've yet to try it, but how upsetting that a good amount of it is lost!"
1,Leaked!!,I also received my package of this oil and it had leaked out all over the inside of the bag-- not happy at all!!
4,Good Stuff,"I bought this oil after reading a description of its benefits in Tim Ferris' 4-Hour Body. I couldn't find it in my local stores, so online seems to be the only way to get it. Tim said it tastes buttery, but I don't get that. It tastes like Macadamia nuts (duh). That said, it does taste better than olive oil for frying eggs and other high-temp frying. I'd like to find it in a larger size, at a cost-per-ounce saving.I intend to buy it again when it's getting close to empty; which, at the rate I'm using it, will be pretty soon."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds).I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds. I suggest you buy a couple songs, but not waste your money on buying the whole CD."
4,Uematsu Having a little fun,Nobuo is allowed to take a few creative liberties in his own cover band as keyboardist. He wrote the music to start with and this is a rock band that does covers of the originals. Expects some edgier versions of the battle theme from FF7 and a few other favorites. I would recommend these works just for the sake of seeing how versatile this composer really is.
5,An electric jolt to game music from the master of game music,"At first i was leery about this album. Hard rock remakes of game music? Sounded like another Minibosses album...but then i saw the track list and beheld that one of my fave songs was on it. The eternal classic 'Dancing Mad', the boss theme for my all time favorite villain Kefka. Right then and there i knew i had to have the album, if just for that song alone. Luckily i found a used copy for cheap..and after listening to it..i realized just how wrong i was to judge this album without looking into it. With one glaring exception i.e. 'Battle Scene II', the entire CD is perfect. From the nostalgia bringing 'Battle Scene I', to the made-me-cry-in-bliss redo of 'Dancing Mad', and even the techno-esque 'J-E-N-O-V-A', everything was so..so...well, i can't really put it into words. So be a good Uetmatsu fan and get this album...NOW! I mean it! Click the buy button! you won't be wasting cash!"
4,Sweet album,TOTALLY SWEET ALBUM! The guitars are awesome in this album. One gripe I have is the lack of songs. They should have put more battle themes on here..
2,Stuff you already know,I thought this book was going to have lots of advice for manners but a lot of the stuff was actually pretty obvious to most normal people. I was disappointed with what I paid for the book.
1,Waste of money,"This book was a huge waste of time and money, as all of the information is common sense and copied from other books. I found no new or interesting information here."
3,Cute manners book that needs a little more pizazz,"This book does include some helpful information, but at times I found it boring. If you really liked the other two books in this series you probably would like this one as well."
3,Emily Post Redux,"This is a cute book, but lacking in substance. Like her other books in this series, it's layout is like a magazine- with watercolor illustrations, quotes and short paragraphs interspersed through out the pages. The advice Kate gives is not bad- it's just that you can get this information, and in greater detail from Emily Post's book. Kate does give some modern advice for cell phones and re-gifting, but nothing you have not heard already. It was an entertaining one-time read that you can finish in about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Check it out at your library instead of buying a copy though."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her ""discovery"" of this information."
2,They cut down trees for this?,"Kate Spade is no etiquette expert, which may be why this dull little book seems to have no viewpoint and seems to be basically a lightly rewritten selection of other etiquette books. Does the world really need another book on ""how to behave"" written by a superrich socialite with little or no contact with the real world? I say no. Plus, Kate Spade really has nothing to say on this subject. Now, all that said, it is a very lovely-to-look-at book, which says to me that Spade should stick to what she knows: design."
5,Awsome,I felt the book gave me a very good view of the history of Poland and Russia during the 1800's. A little long during some of the battles but very discriptive and to the point.
5,This Cd was very well put together!,I like this Cd because it doesn't focus on money and girls. It focuses on diversity and culture. Love it baby!
5,The CD is an awesome display of talent.,"I have reviewed all of speech work and it makes me feel so good to know that someone isn't always talking about sex, women, and money. Glad that it is about spiritual things in life."
2,Be careful,"Snuff bottle connection , aka Secret Rivals 3 in South Africa was always one of my favourite karate movies of the late 70's.However the DVD transfer does no justice to this movie.Who ever did the transfer to DVD needs to see an optician as almost half the movie is out of frame and this really spoils everything.Well if you prepared to watch it like that,I feel the company should drop the price to about $4.99 maximum.Do yourself a favour buy Invincible Armour instead.A classic in its true form."
4,GET THIS!!!,This is a classic! I recommend this to any kung fu fan!A must have!The kid doing the monkey style of kung fu is funny! The Russian fighters are better then I would have suspected. I'm a huge Hwang Lee fan. It's plain to see that Lee is far superior in skill in real life than his enemies in his movies. When he looses it's not convincing. You see him just give up and lose in the last battles in his movies because it's written in the script. He truly is my favorite kung fu villain.
2,Not the best....,"Am I the only one who doesn't like this straightener?I must have a defective one, because mine never seems to get my hair straight. It doesn't release the moisture right; it leaves my hair damp and sticky and still doesn't straighten it right. I have wavy kinda thick hair, and whenever I straighten it with this straightener it frizzes back out in 5 minutes. A BLOW DRIER straightens my hair better than this!!!"
2,Good results but at a cost,"I have had this hair straightener for two years. It gets very hot and can straighten my hair in about 30 minutes. But the outside gets so hot that it hurts my hands. I need to set it on a metal surface so as not to damage my dresser. The on/off buttons on the left side are rather sensitive, so when I'm gripping the handle I often turn the iron off without realizing it until the straightener becomes ineffective and needs to reheat."
1,"Disturbing pictures of irrelevant, already made, jewelry","Was looking for a step-by-step instruction book.This presentation of the jewelry making techniques is thoroughly disturbing my focus by throwing in large, space-waisting pictures that has nothing to do with the process I am trying to learn.The text concerning the techniques lies in big flakes between these. At the bottom - and disturbed by page shifts! - lies the descriptions.Tip: why not focus on the jewelry making processes and put in more pictures concerning them? Put the already made jewelry in a section in the back, with an ""Example"" pointer from the jewelry making instruction."
4,Great Introduction with beautiful pictures,"This book covers basic jewelry metalsmithing techniques in a way that you can understand. The step by step instructions allow a good jumping off point for creative minds. Everything is very detailed and the images give reasonable explanation on how to create pieces. Included instructions are how to achieve heat scarring with SS, making bezels, designing boxes, and different forms of casting. With that said there are pictures that have techniques that are not included and seem very interesting; it is somewhat annoying to look at something and have no idea how to make it (Pg. 50, 81, and 86)."
5,Great for the basics,"This book is great to review the basics of various techniques without too much fluff. Nicely organized, laid out and illustrated, and written well. I am learning metalsmithing, and it was very helpful in reviewing and complementing the techniques I've learned, and gave me some new ideas too."
2,not what I expected,Ok I would need a metal working shop to do many of the projects show in this book. It is way beyond what an everyday jewelry maker would do.
4,A very useful book!,"This is an excellent book to read if you want to learn about wastewater treatment or just if you want to refresh your knowledge of this theme. The book presents easy to follow examples in many of the topics, say, clarifiers design (primary, intermediate, final), Aeration basins, etc. I prefer this book rather than Viessman & Hammer because it is much more friendly. I have not check yet the part of the book corresponding to water treatment, but the wastewater part is very good."
3,"I like them, I prefer them, but they can be improved","I like that they are very absorbent, my children have never been allergic to their material. It's OK price, compared to the cheaper brands with poor quality. The only brand that in my opinion tops Pampers is the Seven Generation, because their design is better (pleaded in the back preventing stuff coming out of the diaper, absorbent material all the way front and back, and wider sticky bands on the side), only draw back is that Seven Generation is more expensive than Pampers. That is why, for me Pampers is the middle choice for my kids."
3,"Great for pee, not so much for mustard poo",Doesn't contain mustard poo very well. My 3-month old has regular blowouts out the back of these and I end up doing lots of yucky laundry. Great for pee though!
3,"Seems alright,","I bought all this billionaires books and learned a few things. many of his books must have been sold through seminars, simplistic formulas before buying check out his videos on you tube, this book was easy to read beginer level success in my opinion."
4,Very well balanced,Of course one should expect that from the father of the third edition d20 system. The previous reviewer is accurate about the content. I personally didnt think it was quiet as good as some other products available but its a added bonus that the content requires no review if your players want to use it. Its that well balanced.
2,Not exactly what I had wanted,"This product was accepted as a substitute for what Ihad wanted. The ""gold"" shampoo is what I have used foryears but apparently was not available, and this wasdisappointing. However, I prefer the Roffler productsas top notch."
2,Not leather at all!,"I just received this pair in brown croco--and I do not like them. The product is described as leather upper, well, the leather upper is about one-inch inside the top of the boots. The boots are not made with leather but man made material. I wished that they put that on the product's description. I found it very misleading....I purchased the boots with leather in mind. I know 52.50 is a great price and I should not be this disappointed. I was able to buy fine leather boots from Enzo Angiolini last year for the same price. I'm frustrated more on the person who put the product's description than the way the product was made. I am sending back these boots. I'm really sorry about that."
1,a waste of money,as a massage therapist and a former gymnast i have to say this will only miss lead you in believing you have any help stabilizing your ankle i would only suggest it to some one i truly do not like
2,Too bulky,I sprained my ankle and was looking for some extra support while I played Volleyball and exercised. This was just too bulky for my athletic shoes. By the time I returned it and looked for something else I had already healed!!
4,"good, but not quite enough",decent lateral ankle supportrelatively comfortable and solid snug fitbutnot quite as comprehensive of support as i had hopedand a bit cumbersome to put on / take off
5,Too good,This is by far the best ankle brace i ever used. I suffered a sprain two 4 days back and played for 2 hours with brace and felt to pain. This is just great.
3,size difference,the size chart given was off. i odered it based on this chart and the brace was to small. it was a great quality brace..
3,Could be better,This ankle brace is good because I have full control over how much I want to tighten it. The bad part is that this brace kills my heel. It really digs into it. I have a bad ankle from having a car running over my foot and sometimes is very painful to walk on it. I put the brace on and the ankle pain is gone but soon the heel pain starts in.I tried the medium and large size because my foot is 11 1/2. The medium was to tight on the top of my foot towards my toes but fit better around my ankle. The large fit better around the top of my foot towards my toes but was more loose around my ankle like it was too big. I ended up buying the large because the medium was way to tight on top of my foot and I did not want it to cut off any circulation.I use my brace for normally walking and running for 1 hour.The brace is built very well.
4,Tennis Player,"I've never worn an ankle brace. I have no comparisons to make to other braces. But, after hurting my Achilles tendon and developing some tendinitis, I wanted some support when I started back playing tennis after taking a few weeks off. This brace allowed me to play singles and provided the extra support that I needed to keep me from re-injuring my ankle. I was very happy with it. It did not slow me down.I wore it around the house some to get used to it before hitting the courts. I learned to adjust the thickness of my socks. Wearing two pair was often the best. The first time I played, I just played 30 minutes, and I had to make a few adjustments in my socks and where specifically I positioned it on my ankle to prevent it from rubbing the top part of my foot. After that first trial run, I was able to use it effectively and play for several hours at a time without blisters or discomfort."
4,Well worth the money,"I've worn it while hunting. It stablized my ankle, and was easy to put on and not hot. It's much better than an Ace bandage. No walking limitations, and I don't think running would be a problem, (for others, not me). A good, serviceable product."
3,did not solve my problem,I had peronis tendonitis and the pressure of the braces helped the pain but I could not run for a while in anycase...
3,bulky but great support,"Tricky to wear with shoes as it is pretty bulky, but it does provide great ankle support so I'm keeping it!"
5,"Same great quality, now $3.00 more!","This was a blowout at $7.49, but my local Wal-Mart checks in with this at $9.44 versus amazon.com's current price of $10.49. Wal-Mart also has the 33-pack at $14.29, so even with sales tax, I can get a better deal there."
2,"Close, but no cigar...","I have had this case for 5-6 months and as of yesterday, it is no longer usable. The clip where it connects to the case itself actually came loose from the case and cannot be repaired. The case provides good protection for the phone, and the multi-dapter concept is great, but for me the durability wasn't there. Also, I don't like the plastic over the little window where the time shows when the phone is closed. The plastic makes it much harder to see the time."
3,Could be better,Case is OK but detracts from the slimness of the Razr. The rugged finish is very good when there's a chance of knocks or scuffs. The belt clip can sometimes be pushed off causing the phone to fall. Generally satisfied but the clip could be made more secure.
3,Need Improvement,This product needs improvement because it keeps popping off of my belt and may damage my cell phone...this would be a better product if it clipped on horizontally or in the direction of the belt
4,Wonderful Japanese recogniton for human being,"Plese let me say first, I am a Japanese researcher of dance therapy. When I think the differences of concept of body and mind between the United States and Japan, I always feel our traditional recognition for human being is really wonderful. Basically we take it granted for that our being and thought are effected by nature. Watsuji's idea on this book is mainly described about this concept. Climate is our fundamanetal suroundings. Climate leads us to create our own culture. This is human being who lives in this earth. I really hope to read in English feeling the difference of the expression between English and Japanese."
5,Surfer's Guide to Baja,"Damn good guide, well worth the $$$. Covers from Cal/Mex border, all the way down and around East Cape."
1,Don't go to baja,"Don't bother going down to Baja. There is nothing down there but dangerous roads, banditos and onshore wind without rideable waves."
3,Item Received Did Not Match Photo,I ordered this expecting the 24 volt output to be in the wires through the threaded nipple like in the photo. What I got had screw terminals for the 24 volts and wires for the 120 volts.
2,Samira?Samir?Samira? -Monotony sets in.,"I found this book extremely disappointing and dull. The style of writing was a rather unconventional narrative, but unfortunately I don't think it worked out, instead it just rambled, and flitted from one person to the next, almost like a middle-school essay. It was quite obvious that the author wanted shed some light on a few issues regarding afghan society, which she thinly disguised as a novel/biography, practically spelling out the issues for the reader. After the 3rd chapter, I found the writing very monotonous, with continuous use of the same phrases. The only reason I finished the book was because I kept waiting for something to happen. However, I felt as if perhaps, the author was given x amount of words, waffled on throughout the book, trying to be poetic and had to cram as much into the ending as possible, without making much of an impact. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,"the wondering mind,","I live in the coal fields of West Virginia, and so many of the machine.s shown are used all around me everyday, but yet they are seldom seen, and when a person can get a good idea on the size and the various uses of these machines, so for me i think it is very interesting, and i hope i can get a copy of this show soon."
1,They cant seem to get it right!,I ordered this fuel pump according to the specs and picture posted. What I received was nothing like what I ordered! the only thing that was the same was the fact that they both pumped fuel. Then I had to call and argue with Mohinder over in Bangladesh to get it straightened out and an exchange set up.The second pump was just as wrong as the first one! Another call to Mohammed over in Bangladesh and a bunch of back and forth comparing pictures and specs to convince him that what was being advertised WASNT what was being shipped! This time I wasnt offered any sort of refund or exchange and NO return info or call tag was sent. The second wrong pump is still sitting here!***Update***I just looked and they have now taken down the picture of the wrong pump and replaced it with a picture of FOUR wrong pumps! None of them even vaguely resemble the part number that they are offering!CAVEAT EMPTOR!
1,bait and switch,"I thought I was ordering a computer for $750.00, but when the order came back, its price was $1,764.96. I have tried to cancel this order, but don't know if I was successful. There is no way that I can see to contact amazon.com accounting department to clarify this portion of my otherwise book order. My rights were taken away, and I did not have the information on the real price of this item until I got my confirmation. If I don't hear from Amazon.com, I'll have to cancel my order via my credit card. Does anybody know how to contact these people??? Helpless @ mehlman@patmedia.net."
4,Not strong enough? Too strong!,"I have not seen an adequate review of this product yet, so I will try to write one: Since this thing uses 19.4 volts to run, it is a power hog. It blows the circuits on something like an airline seat plug-in. You can't find a 12v adapter for one, because it's too powerful and no one makes one. I have a C/D drive setup with a 20/60 GB capacity that is just senseless. Put the whole thing on one drive. The fan sounds like a runaway locomotive. Windows XP Home edition? Puhleez! Half the rest of the ""pre-installed"" software was trial editions that expired if you didn't buy them! It's heavy! It's huge. Good screen, great wireless performance but there are better choices!"
1,"Defective Hard Drive, BEWARE","I purchased the 60 Gig Hard drive version of this computer in July, and on December 5th the hard drive broke. It will not mount and makes grinding and clattering noises. I have lost data. This is not a quality product. I am now returning it to Sony (Sony Event#E26545346). I thought Sony made quality products and I paid a premium for their notebook compared to other notebooks and look at what I get. I am very unhappy. I wonder if this is more than just an isolated incident. I will never buy a Sony product again and do everything I can to stop others from buying Sony's products.So if you like your hard drive unexpectingly crashing and like to lose data then go ahead and roll the dice and buy this computer."
1,poor quality,"I ordered a few of these for our twin's room and they are very poor quality. They are clearly just photo copies of actual posters, and not very good ones at that. They shouldn't sell them as ""posters"" when they're really not. I recommend paying a little more and getting something better. Seriously, you could do a screen shot on your computer and print it out and it would be about the same (maybe better) than what you get from this company."
4,Malice Downstream (book),"This author's books are top notch, if you like the British whodunit type of mystery. The best of his works, in my opinion, is Malice In Cornwall; but Malice Downstream is a very close second. Each book is a good mix of humor, romance, and blood. Great for a rainy night!"
5,Perfect!,I love this colander. It's the perfect size and the plastic it's made out of is very good quality. I would recommend
5,Happy to have it in the kitchen,"For some reason, I thought that maybe this colander was a flexible, folding rubber/plastic, but fortunately this wasn't the case!On pulling it out of the box, I was surprised and impressed with the whole-colander look of it, with all the drainage holes, the color, and the feel. It has a good weight, supported nicely by the handles. And especially, it has enough of a diameter to really be functional for draining all usual things in the kitchen.I hope it's indestructible, as it ""sounds"" a little fragile on knocking the counter with it, almost like knocking a glass, but it's supposed to be an awesome kind of plastic, so what else would you need in a colander?!"
3,Sits too low in the sink,"This colander works well, except it sits too low, maybe only 1/4"" from the bottom of the bowl to the surface below. If draining a huge pot of pasta, the water gets backed up in the sink and the pasta is basically sitting in water that has also touched the sink for a few seconds -- gross! Am buying a replacement."
4,No complaints.,It's not that cheap but the bright red color does add some flash to the kitchen. It's great that you can set it on the counter too. My only issue is that it's quite large and we rarely use it when we're only making a small dinner.
5,An extremely useful colander.,This is a sturdy large Colander that is very useful in the kitchen. However it is useful for sorting small seeds from large seeds. I have Budgies and a Conure. So I can buy a bag of seeds and sort easily.
5,Great colander for acid foods,This is a perfect colander for making acid foods that will react with aluminum. Of course it's fine with any food. And it's pretty!
5,Review for Book,"The book is well written. Also, it is written so even if you don't know much Economic jargon you can follow it closely. Many viewpoints and ideas for solving the problem are suggested and key essays that have direct relevance today are used to support viewpoints.Moreover, suggestions for the how much and what type of assistance should be given to eventually eradicate the prevalence of this problem is explained in much detail."
1,Junk product and poor customer service,"This product is junk. My Canon Pixma MP500 does not recognize it. This seller was no help. They were quick to advise me that I bought the wrong product. They advised me that there was a place on the web page to verify whether or not the cartridges would work with my Cannon printer. I found no such thing. Their representatives don't understand that the word compatible means ""Will work with."" They think it means not the OEM product. I was advised that they would not take the product back because I had opened it. I guess there is some other way to find out that a product is defective without opening the packaging, but I haven't figured it out yet. Don't get ripped off with this cheap incompatible junk, and horrible customer service. Save yourself the money and trouble and by the OEM product."
5,Works well,Looks cool and very reflective. Worked well for decorating a bike with pin-striping and proved to be highly reflective back to the source.
5,I am officially hooked on Bellydancing!,"I got this dvd as a gift and I love it. I feel more fluid and graceful in my dancing, I never moved my body like this before, having a ballet background which is totally different. Now I am undulating all the time. The only thing I questioned was the head-tossing movement in the bellydance combinations at the end, but I asked my trainer and he said that they are fine as long as you do them in a relaxed, loose way and not stiff or thrashing. The two performances were amazing; Rania is a brilliant dancer. Like I said, I am officially hooked."
3,Fun workout,"After doing all the Neena and Veena tapes I was excited to see this new Rania series. The moves will take longer to learn if you've never done any bellydancing before (the Neena and Veena tapes are a good start), but no bellydance experience is needed. The production quality and music is good. I found the voice over helpful in doing the moves. The workout was fun; the 30 minutes passed by quickly. Rania does an interesting sword balancing dance at the end. The reason I didn't rank the video higher was because I think the title ""Fitness for Weight Loss"" is misleading. The workout is good, but slow paced. I'm a workout newbie and I didn't come close to breaking a sweat. By the title I thought it would be more cardio. This is more of a relaxing slowdance."
2,Not one Boogie,"I purchased this video based on the fact that I saw her website and brought some music that she recommended. I thought that with a Boogie title there would be some movements to get me sweating and music that would have me in love.I was seriously disappointed. Rania looked like she wanted to do her own talking but the voiceover was there. And there there were the two blondes who seemed to get more camera time than Rania. The movements were not really what I wanted to get me up and moving (I really hated the on bended knee with chicken neck movements). Considering the type of music Rania recommends on her site I was shocked at the music selected for her dancing. It was boring, slow, and really didn't seem Middle Eastern. I am glad that I got it on sale for 8.99. I might buy the other two videos to complete the set that I have but I am not sure if I will buy anymore with her teaching unless I view it first."
1,Love Belly Dance but not This DVD,"I really enjoy the traditional music and movements involved with belly dance--for the most part both are absent from this dvd. I felt that it was contrived and can't for the life of me see what people think is so good about Rania's dancing, she moves like a robot. I thought one of her background dancers was much more at ease and inspirational. This DVD is a waste of time and money. There are other much better bellydance videos and DVDs on the market. I recommend the series by Veena and Neena Bidasha instead."
2,Not for tenique!,"If you are just looking for a different workout you might like this. If you have or want to study bellydance pass this one up! No technique is taught or demonstrated, the girls on the video are not bellydancers. The music is not middel eastern but jazz/r&b. The intro on the sleeve is horrible....sexy moves to spring on your lover...gag. Real bellydancing is an art form not a strip tease! I have seen this woman in a bahngra video which I liked, but that may be because I don't know much about bahngra."
5,It does what it's meant to do,"If you are out walking, going to a fair, going somewhere where you don't want take a purse, this is perfect. It fits a wallet, droid razor phone, tissue, keys, and a bit more. I have no complaints, except it would be great if they offered more colors."
4,Love the water holder,I wouldn't be without a water holder in my fanny pack. It comes in so handy. Bought this one as a gift
3,Bit disappointing,"I ordered two waist packs as I wasn't sure which one could fit my large mobile phone the best. While I much preferred the quality of the other pack, it didn't fit my phone as well, and my arm hit the water bottle when I walked. This one is better in that my arm doesn't hit the water bottle. However the quality is ""average"" and it doesn't fit as well around the waist. I'll keep using it for now, but I'm on the look out for something better..."
3,Just ok...,Like these cases but hard to stack them with anything else other than another skb of the same kind. They are slippery and fall off the cart going into hotels etc.....
1,no pink panther,there isn't one pink panther episode on the whole dvd. wouldn't buy pink panther again if it was the last dvd on earth!
3,"great music, wack rhyming","first i've gotta say, the production on this album/mixtape is beautiful. it's about as creative as it gets and really gives off an inspiring summer day vibe. tonedeff is also present on this project and you can always expect tonedeff to drop an amazing verse on every track he rhymes on. the problem is, tonedeff is pretty much the only good lyricist spitting on this album. the other dudes are average at best, some clever lines here and there but overall, their rhymes sound painfully forced.overall, i would recommend this joint to all of the hardcore hiphop heads out there because you would be missing out on some great material without it, but overall, this mixtape is underwhelming at best.highlights:fifth gearinverseeyesmy lady"
4,Great CD,I have to write a short review about this great CD. This CD is well worth the money. You can play it all the way through and not be dissappointed. Tracks 1-5 are on hit and are played continously on my way to work to get me going in the morning. Definitely a good purchase.
2,Boring...,"I picked this up after reading the glowing reviews and seeing this book recommended on a number of forums but it was really boring for me.I didn't see 2 heroes here. Jessie, Charles' brother is clearly the hero but he's kind of a jerk for too long for me. Charles' kids are cute and Maddie is a pretty great heroine and I liked Charles but Jessie was too much of a butt for me and it just dragged and was too boring for such hype in my opinion.It's not one I'd recommend to anyone. I had to force myself to finish it because at nearly half way it was getting sleepy and by then I just skimmed like crazy."
5,Proper,"I love every second of this record. If you love reggea, buy this 5 minutes ago. Really not much else to say."
4,Gregory Watts review of Pirates of the Digital Millennium,"Gantz and Rochester's book, Pirates of the Digital Millennium was a good book. In their deep study of digital piracy, they provided a solid foundation for the reader to fully understand and create his own opinion. The information gathered from focus groups and the 1,000 people they either surveyed or talked to provided a wide range of ideas and levels of how people looked at digital piracy. It is evident that people of all ages engage in it and most feel it is ok as long as they are doing it for their personal use only. Downloading and copying have increased mainly due to the customers feeling the prices are too high. There was also a feeling that the artists are not being treated fairly by the production and distribution companies so we are not taking money from them.I would recommend this book for those who would really like to understand all sides of this issue, including the legal and ethical problems."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!,"This book is absolutely wonderful! I enjoyed it very much. It really explains how different agencies, such as the RIAA, MPAA, and BSA are taking action against intellectual property violators. It's kinda scary the power these agencies have. It really shows how much power these agencies have over certain things and those powers could possibly violate our constitutional rights. The book gives different reasons why people pirate and how to resolve the issue as best as we can. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in intellectual property copyright laws."
2,A Woman that feareth the Lord.,"This book has loose pages in it and I don't consider that ""good condition"" As for the contents of the book ""Exceptional"""
4,pretty good - not as energizing as I'd hoped,"I bought this product to energize myself in the morning. The scent is reasonably pleasnt - althought not 'pleasing' - it is slightly antiseptic. It does perk me up, but I think I prefer something with a stronger citrus smell. The oil itself is a nice consistency and you can smell it with no heat, but on a heat source (e.g.,StealStreet SS-A-59607 Electric Aroma Oil Burner, Glass Purplethe oil heats up nicely releasing a stronger scent."
4,Nice game,"Overall, this is a good game. It's easy to put together, and pretty durable given its price. I think I was crazy when I bought this game; I have a two year old daughter, and I thought that she would be able to play with it, but this is above her skill level. Unless your kid has Tiger-Wood-like ability, I would wait until they are much older before buying this for them. Miscellaneous tip: if you don't want to fill the thing up with sand or water, you can just put some heavy books on top of the base, and that works just as well.Couple of thoughts to mention...The ball can swing around pretty fast and high, and if you're not careful, you could get hit with it. Keep this in mind if you are buying it for small children. Another problem with this game is that the rope often gets caught at the connection to the post, and starts to coil/wrap around the post; this happens if you don't hit the ball hard enough. It is a little annoying, and breaks the rhythm of the game."
4,GREAT TOY-- BUT SHOP AROUND FOR PRICES,"Our kids received Swingball for Christmas and have been playing non stop since. Because it is winter, we set it up inside the house on the hardwood floors and instead of putting water or sand in the base as suggested, we loaded it up with books. Our 3 children love to play it all the time. It is great fun, and perfect for little ones to learn eye-hand coordination. One warning, 2 of our children got cuts on the insides of their thumbs at the holes where the screws are on the plastic racket handles. We're guessing it was from sharp edges on the plastic. We wrote to the manufacturer and received no reply. We just placed some tape over the edges and they are good to go. Shop around for prices. We got this for $29 from a major department store."
2,Fun while it lasted,"This is a great game and the children were thrilled when it arrived. Directions say you can fill the bottom with water or sand. I used water... that may have been the problem. Regardless, on day 2 of playing the entire set fell over and a piece of the top that controls the string rotation to the top or the bottom broke off. You can still play, but who ever is trying to win in the direction of the broken piece has an unfair advantage and the children haven't played it since. I sent an email to the store to see if I could purchase a replacement part, but they didn't offer it. I may try the manufacturer, but I haven't yet."
4,Swingball Tetherball Set,I bought this for my grand daughters a few years ago and they still love it. I has held up well.
4,Tether Ball Review,"I gave this toy to my 12 yr old son for Christmas and he loves it! We put a couple bricks in the base and it is very sturdy. It is also outside, and even though it's cold out, it hasn't stopped him from playing with it.He loves it! My main concern was if it was going to be sturdy enough; I didn't need to worry. The pole stays in placy, the string and ball have been holding up just fine. And if you load the base with weights, it stays put.I would recommend this !"
4,Swingball is a hit!,"Bought swingball for an 8 yr old and 5 yr old grandchild and they love it.I would recommend water vs sand as the filler for the base, as easy to empy/"
4,Swingball Tetherball,I saw this product at a friend's home and thought it would be perfect for my grandchildren. Great for ages 3-7 for hand/eye coordination and for continuous play (cord does not wrap around pole like tetherball). Very satisfied with the product.
3,Swingball can be dangerous.,"The Swingball was well made and easy to assemble. Unfortunately, my 6 yr old grandson (and his sister) could not use it without hitting each other with a racket or the ball. It may be a fun challenge for older children."
5,THUMPS UP!,I RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS MAGELLAN 8MB DIGITAL MEMORY CARD AND ALL I COULD SAY IS THAT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Teachers Beware!,"I was looking for a video of this short story by Marquez because my high school class was reading it in school. I borrowed the tape from a local library before I bought it to see if we wanted a copy in our library.I thought the movie was very true (overall to the author), and I enjoyed how closely the director kept to the story, but then the second half changed dramatically from the first half, so much that I became very thankful that I previewed the tape before I showed it to my class.There was quite a bit of profanity in the second half, AND there were several sexual scenes that could not be shown in the classroom. These scenes were not in the short story, so I guess they were added to give some spice to the video, but I thought it was very unnecesary, and of course, now my students can't enjoy it in class as we had hoped to do after we read the story. Obviously, Hollywood isn't the only production area that adds 'T & A' because they think it will help sell the video."
4,Heavy Strings,"IT's an awesome product..Great sound..but the only problem i had was the Low E,A and D string required so much tension that the spring, for my vibrato, couldn't sustain it, and the bridge kept rising up from the body.. SO basically i could tune only the three low strings.. But still love the strings.."
3,Good for my son Good for me.,"My son is a rookie on guitar playing and changing the strings. The item promptly arrived and glad it has free shipping. He said the strings were for electric guitar and his is not. Anyway, he changed the strings but somehow one of them ""broke"" while he was changing it. He is still strumming that guitar though. Will buy again."
4,the ideal strings,Although these strings don't excite me- I believe they are an extremely smart buy and they sound great! I like elixirs but they are rather pricey so this is an awesome alternative to those; So hey why not try them out and save some money? I couldn't give it 5 out of 5 with an honest heart because I haven't tried many other strings- so maybe I'll change my mind- cant go wrong with these set though!
2,Nickel wears off on unwound strings!,"I have been playing guitar for 25 years. I have tried every brand of strings under the sun. Every now and then, I'll buy a set of slinkys after several years. Every time, I remember why I never buy them. After a few hours, the nickel finish wears off the unwound G B and E strings! This is only after a matter of hours, if the same fret position is played enough. Sure, they sound great for a couple of hours, but WTF? Once the nickel wears off, finger slides on the unwound stings ""catch."" You can feel your finger stop on that fret position. Rough and not slick at all. This is a deal breaker for me. Who wants to spend the money to change their stings every other day?Overall, I prefer D'Addario for their consistency in manufacturing, tone and quality. No strings last forever, but I always end up going back to D'Addario. I also like GHS Nickel Rockers for their smooth playability and warm tone."
4,Ernie Ball Regular Slinky String Set (10 - 46),I've always used D'Addario EXL110 Electric Guitar Strings but thought I'd give these a try as a lot of my fellow guitarists use them. Will update once I have had a chance to experience them...
4,Only way to go,You can have people tell you all day that you must buy expensive strings for your guitar. It is truly not the case; Ernie Ball has a countless number of different sets for both electric and acoustic that can fit any need. The regular slinky strings are great for just about any type of elctric playing you may do. The only time I feel I need something else is when I start playing a lot of blues I switch to either super slinky or hybrid slinky strings for the harder bends.
5,Up to par,"If you like to beat the life out of your guitar like I do, then these strings are for you. I've had these strings for 2 months and they have surpassed the life expectancy of all other strings I have destroyed. Though, they do tend to go out of tune rather often. But that can also be attributed to my habits of string abuse. Would recommend to any metal head."
5,best strings ever!!,"package arrived on time. These are my all time favorite strings. The only time I ever deviate from this brand is if I want to try something new. I have yet to find another brand that can turn my head, so I stick to what I know best. ANd this is it."
3,Didn't last very long,"As expected, the sound was great, but with heavy playing my strings didn't last more than 2 weeks. Hopefully it was just that particular set?"
3,Ernie Ball 2220 Power Slinky's Performance vrs Value,I bought a three-pack set of Ernie Ball 2220 Power Slinky Nickel Round Wound Electric Guitar Strings expecting they would last through a couple of shows thus being a good value for the money. Unfortunately these strings oxidize rapidly losing tone and response. All in all a medium string for the money. Although they are not as durable as other brands of similar quality they have one saving grace in that they can be used on both acoustic or electric guitars.
3,"Great strings with power, however...","I based my rating on a few things. These strings sounds great tone-wise, and they are certainly good for those looking for a bit more sustain on the lower strings. HOWEVER, I noticed that these strings, even though they are very long lasting for the price, they begin to, for the lack of a better phrase, ""crap out"" and begin to detune on my '98 Fender Telecaster (which, by the way, has NEVER had any tuning problems). My hypothesis is that the gauges of the strings are not right for my specific guitar, so if you are a Fender player I would not recommend these gauges. Other than that, great balance between playability and power."
5,Super-duper Super Slinkys,"i have been playing guitar for over a year now, and searched high and low for good quality strings but when i tried super slinkys on my SG, i haven't heard a better tone and sound from any other strings I've used on my guitar. Super Slinkys have had the longest life-span on my guitar without the need of replacement strings, or string cleaning cloths. i still use Super Slinky Stings today, and i have never been happier with the crisp and clean sound that comes from my guitar."
2,bet they break,These strings are hard to tune and have a very tinny sound. g string broke first week. Going back to Martins.
5,Solid guitar strings,These strings sound exactly how you think they should. When I switched them out with my 5+ month old beat up strings it was an instant and huge change of tone and brought my strat back to life!
5,Livin the low life,"Amazing strings. Perfect for Drop c tuning. Good crisp tone and they stay ""fresh"" for a decent amount of time. I find that these particular strings have a veryu quick break in period. I will never use a different string set for my Drop C guitar."
5,Great strings.,"These strings are great for all sorts of playing styles. I bought a set of 9's and 10's and I also have some D'Addario 11's. The 9's are super slinky just like the name says. They're great for quick movement around the fret board. My only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding. I play a lot of rock, and sometimes these just don't pack a punch like the 10's or 11's do. All in all though, these are great strings, and I will definitely continue to buy Ernie Ball, I'll probably opt for 10's or 11's though."
4,Do you like Stevie?,These have a full rich tone. Ernie ball will never let you down and these strings are no exception!Ernie Ball 2626 Not Even Slinky Custom Gauge Nickel Wound Guitar Strings (.012 - .056)
4,Love these strings but...,I've been using ernie ball for years.But I used to build by my own pack before this.I tune 1 1/2 steps down drop B.I don't like that the 3rd string is wound instead.I also replace the sixth string to 60 for drop.I play a lot of slipknotBC RICH NJ BEAST EMG 81s humbuckers
4,Great strings,Just changed the strings on my Jackson Warrior and I love the feel and sound of these strings. E Balls have always been my favorite. Must have for a great rock and roll sound!!
5,amazing strings!,i have been using Ernie Ball strings for about a year or two now and all i can say is that they are simply amazing compared to other strings these last twice as long and also break alot less and they are also very cheap i will always use Ernie Ball strings i love them <3
3,Buy only if you MUST!!,"I've bought these strings twice.The first time, I was just trying them out.The second time, I was just being stupid.I'm NOT particularly picky about name brands and I never will be, but these strings are absolutely terrible at staying in tune. Let's say you buy these strings on a Monday and you play your guitar for ONE HOUR everyday up until Saturday.....by Sunday, you're strings are going to sound dead! I'm not exaggerating.The only way that I'll by these strings a 3rd time is if I really, really don't have $6 to get my DR Tite Fit strings."
1,Keep breaking.,"I am not fond of these guitar strings. Bought a pack and less then a week of playing the G string broke at the bridge, and just now, not that long after, the top E string broke at the bridge. Update: And the b string now just broke at the base, and I was barely even strumming the bottom strings. These are literally the worst strings ever."
2,strings for beginner,Title says it all... these strings didn' t meet the expectation. Gives sound of an electric guitar for an acoustic blend that I am looking for.
2,.026 string does not fit the nut on my ESP guiutar,"I tune to C, and I usually play Ernie Ball power slinky strings (.011 - .048). I wanted to try a set of 12's. I put the strings on my ESP strat-style guitar. The .056had a very hard time getting through the tuning peg on the headstock. The .026 (3rd string, Eb in C standard, G in regular standard) does not fit in the string slot on the nut. I spent a few days adjusting the truss rod and intonation for these new strings, but they sure don't work well with this guitar. A buddy of mine uses them on his Jackson King V with a Licensed Floyd Rose double locking system and loves it.These would be good on a baritone guitar, but not on my guitar. Gonna try the Blue Steel strings (11 - 52) next. Might end up going back to the EBPS 11-48 set again."
1,Worst strings I ever bought,"I strongly recommend that you do not buy these strings. I made the mistake of buy a pack of three and they go out of tune faster than any strings I've ever had. And not just slightly out of tune, I've had them on my guitar for at least two weeks and they still drop as much as 1/4 tone between when I put my guitar down to eat a sandwich and when I finish."
5,The ONLY strings I will use,"I've tried several different strings on electric, and Ernie Ball Slinkys are the only ones I really trust on all of my guitars. The fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus. But they sound great, and are far less prone to breakage than other brands I have tried. The 9's are super fast and easy to bend, but I've started using 10's more often on my Strats, which creates an even more robust sound. They're an industry standard for a reason - you don't need 15 dollar strings!"
5,great strings and great price,I have always used Ernie balls whenever i play guitar. These strings will not break no matter what and it offers a great tone for your guitar. The strings are 110% worth it.
5,Great strings,I have used Ernie Ball Slinky's on and off for over 28 years. I just used some DiMarzo's and am once again returning to E.B. Slinky's for this guitar. I have never found a better string for the low side of 6 dollars. They have a good rich sound and last better than some brands. I prefer them.
2,Dead in About 4 hours,"If you're looking for a string with long life, this is not the string for you. They sound bright and sparkly when you first slap them on, then just turn into dead muddy crap. great for beginners, terrible for gigging musicians."
4,"Great strings, only minor problems","Great guitar strings, and affordable. I have used these for quite a while, and I have always liked them. Recently, I moved to Boston though, and here they seem to rust really quickly. They never used too. Its not that humid here, so I don't know if I got some bunk strings, or if the quality has gone down in the last year, or if really its the Boston weather. Historically, I have sworn by these though!!"
4,Ernie Ball Strings!,"Great strings, not much I can say besides the slinky (9-42) are great for younger kids, or beginners, or anybody! they're brighter than most, and even have quite a longer life. I usually go for Dunlop (10-46)Jim Dunlop DEN1046 Dun Elec Med 10-46but take it form me when I say the Ernie ball strings are second to none, and if your looking for great slides, hammer on, and pull offs, Ernie ball has an awesome set of (11-48)Ernie Ball 2220 Power Slinky String Set (11 - 48)but I think the (9-42) work just perfect for anything.You can never go wrong with a set of Ernie ball strings, they give great sound, and last longer than Twinkies, if you don't get a set of these your crazy!"
5,The Absolute Best There Is!!! Bar None!,"Ernie Ball strings, whether they are super/regular/hybrid or whatever, are the best I have EVER played!!! I've been playing for over 25 years now, both professionally and for recreation. I have tried everything out there. Ernie balls have never let me down. They don't break for no reason. The balls don't ever unwind. They don't go flat prematurely. They don't go out of tune from simple bending. They keep their edge longer than anything else. You can't go wrong with these things. I use the super slinky's on my floyd rose guitars and strats. I love to use the regular sliky's on the les paul and sg style guitars. I use the heavy/light hybrids on the telecaster. They all work great!!! There is a reason that there are so many well known names on the back of the Ernie Ball package. They are just THAT good! Keep on Rockin'!!!"
4,Guitar strings,"Ernie Ball ; how can you go wrong? It is nice to be able tobuy a mixture of string sizes , without buying 2 sets........."
4,Been using them for years,"like the title says, ive been using these for years. used a hand full of other brands and this is what i always end up with. i either use the 9's or the 10's and detune them."
5,Great Item,It was a great item. very nice strings. It looked really good on my acoustic and electric guitar. Works great
2,Strings will probably break,I am very disappointed I bought these strings. I had the strings for only a few hours and my e broke. Yeah it came with a pick but it broke in less 1 day
1,Terrible strings,"All of the thin strings broke when I was changing them. I have changed my strings before and I've never had this happen. Slinky brand might be a good brand, but heavy bottom strings are not. I'll never buy these again and I wouldn't recommend them at all."
1,Disappointed,"Bought these on the basis of other reviews,string broke while I was attaching it.Not good.I am not a novice,so lets say I got a bad string??Bought two sets will keep you posted....."
2,Doubled the shipping charge to make up for low profit,I was initially charged $8.73 shipping for a $10.89 order of three sets of strings. This is almost twice the Amazon advertised shipping rate. The company quickly agreed to refund $4.00 when contacted but the Instrument Co. is apparently willing to play fast and loose with shipping charges to make up $$$ on low profit items. Buyer beware.
1,Borders on Fraud,If the product doesn't install (and mine didn't) and you seek techinal support...forget it. The manufacturers website is a shell which provides no functional interface. The item is absolutely worthless.
3,Pre-Algebra Book (used),"The book I ordered for my daughter arrived promptly but I have to say the cover is in TERRIBLE shape. The book has no writing in it, so we are going to keep it and just buy a book cover but something really should be posted about the condition of the book inside and out when you are paying these kinds of prices for used books. That would help buyers decide whether they want to make the purchase or not."
5,Best gift ever!!,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She has been a funk for some time and this was the first book she's read in over one year. You can't go wrong with a Doris Miles Disney book.Thank You very much!!
2,Not a deal anymore at 10:49 you can get it at walmart now,Not a deal anymore at 10:49 you can get it at walmart nowfor the same price or cheaper.
4,Great diapers,"Since I found out about Easy Ups, I use nothing else for my son. They make diaper changing a breeze and I believe he is getting the idea of wearing underwear already. They don't leak like I found many other diapers do and they seem so comfortable for him to wear . . . and no more stupid tabs to line up or make red marks on his skin. Only a GREAT DEAL at 7.49 though !"
5,Nice to see the Price Cut,It is nice to see the price cut of $7.49.... much better and if you buy so many you get free shipping!!! I love pampers!!
1,Wrong title,This book is not the text. It is the study guide that accompanies the text. There are 20+ chapters in this paperback study guide which adds to the confusion.
3,NICE HYMNS BUT.....,"The tracks on this cd are unevenly edited for sound,so one is fine, the next loud, the next too soft etc. The hymns are traditional with a fair amount of orchestral accompaniment."
4,Very nice selection of hymns,"John Rutter has long been one of my favorite composers, conductors, and arrangers of modern times. His latest recording does not disappoint overall. The Cambridge Singers have always had a wonderful sound, and Rutter's arrangements of these classic hymns are a good use of their talents. Most of the performances are very simple, accompanied only by organ, though several of the more ""raucous"" arrangements add brass for a bit more power. However, none of the performances really have the power that really shows off a good choir. There's just a little bit lacking in the most powerful arrangements, though ""Christ is made the sure foundation"" is almost there. I also find Rutter's inclusion of his own recent composition ""Eternal God"" slightly pretentious, but I don't hold that against him or the recording. Overall, it's a GREAT choice of hymns that showcase this wonderful choral sound."
5,Pure delight,"For fans of John Rutter, the Cambridge Singers and Anglican choral music in general this recording is one sheer unadulterated delight. The arrangements range from festival with full brass, tympani and organ to folk with harp and the performances are up to the usual high standard of the Cambridge singers. Rutter states in the liner notes that he intended to make a recording that can be listened to for pleasure and he has certainly succeeded--everyone I have played this CD for has loved it."
2,"ok, but not the original mopeds the real mopes, no way!","These scandinavian mopeds are well meaning and clever fellows, just not crazy real raw rock and roll monsters like the mopeds of yore..The scandinavian mopeds are good musicians and this is well recorded, clever borderline-fluff power-pop but, no my darlings, they cannot compare to the bruteish intelligence of the ""real"" mopeds also known as the mopes. An electric duo from the east coast usa (not the uk) that broke up in 1987 and blasted crazy punk rotten psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast. You can checkout a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3's( www.themopes.com ) Compare for yourself. The old dive bar heroes or these newer workmanlike power popsters?"
3,Good story. Good potential. But falls short.,"The Alleluia files wasn't as good as as good as Archangel, by Sharon Shinn. But I will say that it had its good points. I just wish that the relationship between Jared and Tamar could have been deeper. I wish she had done more with the two-if she had, it would have joined the ranks of Archangel. But overall it was well written but somewhat underdeveloped."
5,Don't miss this series,Sharon Shinn has created a wonderful world of Samaria and peopled it with great characters. Read the books in order and hope that she adds a 4th to continue what she has started.
2,Poor,"This book is poor on two subjects: - the author tries to make the world evolve, but does not succeed in giving it reality. In particular, the approach on science is almost ridiculous, - you can skip one page very two pages, the story is so empty. Finally, don't buy the three books, it is not worth the time and the money."
5,Marvelous conclusion to her Samaria trilogy!,"(The first two books are ""Archangel"" and ""Jovah's Angel"".) While I admit I preferred the first two books, this is no less brilliant. The shift from fantasy in the first book, to a melding of fantasy and science fiction in the second, to a predominantly sci-fi atmosphere in the third, is fascinating. Her imagery is beautiful, sweeping you up in the magic and wonder of her world and the music it is filled with. Her ideas are fresh, innovative, intriguing - I'd recommend her to anyone who is tired of traditional fantasy. I'd rather not give away the plot if you haven't read the first two because it would spoil the effect of the revelation. Worth reading and re-reading. Want more."
4,they work ok,"These last as long as the ones I buy at Home Depot. There is nothing special about them, a good product, but they don't seem to last any longer than any other brand that I have tried."
3,small with a few flaws,"I am just barely satisfied with this hydration pack. One zipper has already broken, and there is not much room in any compartment to pack a lunch for the trail"
4,"OK, but not like our ones on hand.",this filter is labedlledc HP-15 but is nt like the ones we have on hand and may be a re labelled standard unit.WSe've found an alternate source so we'll sell this one as a 'normal' filter.Seller probably didn'tg knowe so we have no deficient rating for thedm. they did well in shipping and prompt delivery.
5,EXECLLENT DIAPER,"BEST DIAPER FOR MY BABY....EXECLLENT, MOST THINGS IS NO LEAKS AT ALL...IT'S LITTLE BIT COSTLY BUT ITS WROTH IT.AND ALSO U CAN GET GREAT DEAL AT AMAZON.COM.SO IT WON'T BE COSTLY TO U...U CAN SAVE A LOT WITH THIS.TRY IT.U GONNA LIKE IT...LOVE ITTTTTTT :):)"
2,Deceptive Packaging,"I bought these because of the ""Grow with me fit"" and the 2 packages I bought didn't have the right diapers in them. They had the old swaddlers with the non-elastic sides. I called Pampers and they rectified the situation and sent me coupons for 2 free packs. I should note I didn't buy these from Amazon.com, I bought these at a Babies R Us store. After finally getting a package with the elastic sides (and even w/o the elastic sides) I noticed that there is ALOT of bulk between the legs and my daughter wasn't very comfortable in them. The newborn swaddlers have less bulk between the legs and you think they would pass that on to the size 1&2 swaddlers. These are bulky and don't seem to fit right. I gave them 2 stars because Pampers actually did something about it."
4,great diapers,Grear diapers! NO leaking at all even after 8 hrs. But why now it takes 3-5 wks to ship. This is annoying. Anyone ordered recently?
3,Could have bought these at dollar store...,Could have bought these at dollar store...(nothing much to write but I have ten more words to say and not sure what to write LOL apologies)
1,Save your money an get a better rope.,"Essentially, the design of this rope seems to be an after thought.The way you adjust the length of this rope is to tie a knot at the end of the handle. Then when the knot is pulled inside the handle it leaves obvious space between the ""ball bearing"" and the handle grip. Just doesn't look right..."
4,I've had mine for 35 years.,I really don't know much about the finer points of rope jumping so I can't compare this rope to others. All I can say is it's been a reliable and fun training partner since I was in college. I've never regretted the purchase. Working out with a jump rope is a great idea and this one fits the bill nicely.
3,FOR GENEALOGISTS ONLY,"I am holding the original 1907 hardcover edition in my hand, and its title is ""DUNHAM GENEALOGY, English and American Branches of the Dunham Families.""There are 52 pages of English history, including the journey to Plymouth, followed by 18 pages of text about the ""original settler,"" Deacon John Dunham (who may or may not have been the same person as John Goodman). The remainder of the book consists of straight genealogical information, a few illustrations (photographs) and a few pages of text about a few individuals. I have no information on the accuracy of the genealogical data. Pages 310 through 363 are an index of names (heads of families only) and the last 20 pages are lined blanks where births, marriages and deaths can be recorded.I cannot imagine anyone other than a committed genealogist being interested in this book. I inherited mine from my mother!"
1,Does NOT dissolve,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this product, But I thought I would dissolve the powder in boiling hot water. Did NOT work. I am sensitive to texture, and tried to dissolve it and mask it in juice. It would NOT dissolve at all! I couldn't handle to chalky texture. I know the product magnesium malate is supposed be very good for you, I will try it in pill form instead."
4,Author's response,"In his/her short ""review,"" ""jubjub"" makes the extremely serious accusation that either I, as author, or Irving Dardik, as the subject of the book, must have ""paid"" some of the reviewers, because of their positive comments. (""Jubjub"" uses the derogatory term ""infomercial language."") While I refrain from stooping to respond to such a base claim, I would ask why ""jubjub"" would seek to hide behind a mask of anonymity while making such a claim about me in such a public arena? Does she/he not have the decency or courage to simply identify themselves? What does she/he have to hide, if anything? (In entering this ""review,"" I was asked to select a rating; as author, I simply entered its current rating, not wishing to skew the rate either way.)"
2,"nice story, no details re: how to do it","I really liked the book, on a literary level. It was well written, engaging, and thought provoking. However, it really fails, and fails badly at giving the how to's. I'd love to try the protocol the Dradik has developed and the book describes, but there just isn't enough detail about how to institute it. i feel like I was shown a menu and then told I couldn't ordewr the food. From what I undersatnd, Dardi charges $5,ooo a month to enroll in his program! That leaves out most of the planet. So much for sharing usable information."
4,Good Read,"I am mostly through reading this book. it is informative and it allowed me to know more about the Rosenberg case. However, I cannot help to believe, that the FBI and the DOJ, allowed the bigger fish to escape. I just get the feeling that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were the back benchers of the Soviet spy ring. I am probably wrong but that is the way I see it. I especially like the account of one of the bigger spies who had escaped to the USSR. However, with the fall of the USSR, came back to America just in time to vote in the 1992 election. Ain't justice grand? Do read this book and make up your own mind."
1,Title Should Have Been Peachtree for Accountants.,"On page 2 is the list of ""Foolish Assumptions. Item 1 You already know a little something about the day to day stuff that you need to do financially to run your business- You know, write checks, bill customers, pay employees, and so on....""Of course I am starting a company and do not know how to do any of those any of those things.This book needs to be about book keeping and about book keeping on Peachtree or it can not be used by a DUMMY.The authors did not even recommend a book to do the job of teaching the materials that they assumed the user would know.You have to be an experenced accountant / bookkeeper to understand the material.-"
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is really bad. First of all, it talks about things that may not even pertain to a version of Peachtree that you're using. For instance, it refers to the ""Business Status Center"" and talks a lot about it. But there is no ""Business Status Center"" in anything but Peachtree Complete and higher versions. It doesn't even state that though. I went through the whole book trying to set up a small company on it and I ended up doing much better paying for Peachtree Customer support. Don't waste your time and money!"
3,Neither bad nor good.,"This is not a book for believing Christians. The authordismisses Christ's supernatural nature as just wishful thinking.I wish he had explained why -- but he doesn't.This book was of mixed value to me. It reads like a collegetext book in which a lot of the key information is left as anexercise to the reader. The author makes an understandabledefinition of how he went about determining which sayings ofJesus were original and which were created by the churchesthat sprung up after his death. However the criteria are oftenhard to see in his examples -- I felt that more detailedexplanations would have helped.I am however glad that I bought the book because the author'sexplanations of the sayings of Jesus and the cultural contextof Mathew, Mark, and Luke were enlightening. I guess I wantedmore than I got but was glad to get what I did get."
2,Faulty Premise - But Interesting Read,"The basic premise of this book is, ""If something in the gospel record addresses any concern of the early church, it must be rejected as inauthentic."" The book takes off from there, jettisoning much of the material in the four gospels.While it is true that the four evangelists wrote their books to address certain peoples with certain needs, it does not mean that they were deliberately trying to deceive their disciples by contriving false stories of what Jesus said and did. Also, just because something written in, say, 1890 addresses an issue that faces a certain group of people in, say, 2002, it doesn't automatically invalidate the work of 1890. It just means that perhaps the author had enough foresight to know that certain problems would arise and that he wanted to address those problems.This book will be of interest to Christians who desire to expand their minds and who want to be aware of the reasoning processes of certain schools of theology..."
5,Great Detail,I LOVE these helms by Sideshow they are well made with metals not some cheep plastic.The detail in these helms is fantastic great for LOTR fans.
4,Awesome!,"its a good dvd, havent prepared the food but its good havingit cuz it clearly helps u make the food."
5,Concerned Fan!,"This email is directed towards the person who signed Concerned father. If you paid more attention to what your child was doing (listening to) you would have known who Kid Rock was, and not baught the tape. There is a thing we like to call FREE SPEACH, you know? Kid Rock has that right also.. If you dont like the music, don't listen to it, or buy it.. Kid Rock is awesome!"
1,"star profile, wishing for a song!",Silly me. When my daughter asked me to get her the newest Kid Rock CD.Who would of thought that the CD would be all talking and no music. You have one adult who feels like a jerk and a very confused little girl. Maybe you should sell it under recoreded books or something. My first bad experience with Amazon.
1,"Concerned Father and Outragous ""Kid"" Rock","How could I have thought that this Kid Rock CD could be so bad. I don't follow the Music scene too much, and with a name like Kid Rock I thought that this CD would be a little heavy on the rock if anything. I think Kid Rock should be renamed to Grand Daddy of Rock or Father of Rock, not for his musical ability, but merely because of his herendously explicit lyrics and how little they are helping to form the youth of society. I strongly believe that Kid Rocks should rename himself to help the older generation, or shall I say non-MTV age, to understand what music their children are listening too."
2,Ehhh,"Quality protein -YES, Taste - GROSSSSSS, does not taste as good as any of the other protein bars, and besides the protein being good everything else is down hill, many of the OneWay flavors have a lot of cholesterol and are made by designer whey were protein bars should have 5% or less of the daily value. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Sugar alcohol content in this gave me a stomach ache."
5,My Go To After an Extreme Workout!,"After spending 2 days in Logan UT for an MS bike ride I returned home and directly to my bathtub. I had pedaled 100 miles in 100 degree weather on Saturday. And I went out the second day and rode 50 miles up and down Logan Canyon and other parts. As soon as I was done I drove home a couple of hours away. The first thing I did was relieve my soreness with this product. I filled a big tub with hot water and relaxed as long as the water was warm. I keep at least 3 containers of it next to my tub for apres ski, biking, rock climbing and hiking."
3,Good Workout if you don't mind Rania,"This is a good cardio workout. It will help you work up a sweat. However, if you have trouble with high impact stuff she does some hopping here so you might want another video. The thing about Rania is that she's so stiff. Like she's in shape and her workout is great, so if you don't mind the fact that she can't bellydance for her life because she lacks grace and she's so stiff then get this because it really is a good workout video.The performance at the end is the most atrocious bellydancing I've ever seen in my life. This lady should not have been a bellydancer I'm sorry. She lacks grace, she lacks nusicality. She's not on beat and her facial expressions are horrible. But she can give you a good workout and I guess that's all that matters."
3,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this video, because I really liked Neena and Veena's workout video -but Rania has quite a ways to go to be up to speed with dynamic duo. Neither the warmups or workout were especially imaginative or inspiring, hense the mediocre rating. The biggest surprise was that they did not use middle eastern music for either the workout or the performance. I will not be buying another video from Rania."
4,War In The Shadows: The Guerrilla in History,"As mentioned by another reviewer, this text gives a broad overview of different instances, ranging from the classical age to the 1980's, where unconventional warfare played a prominent role in a conflict. The chapters either focus on a single conflict, most prominently the American intervention in Vietnam, or group several events based on time period. Aside from presenting interesting insight into conflict that herein were unknown or little understood by this reviewer, I found that either Mr. Asprey is deliciously cynical or history shows the sickening irony of human repetition."
2,Superficial,"WitS is a broad survey of non-conventional warfare throughout history (it seems inaccurate to say that the book focuses strictly on ""guerilla"" warfare). The author seems to stretch at times in who he decides to include as ""guerrilla."" Because he covers so much ground, the treatment of each particular case is rather superficial. One would think that, since the book is supposed to be about guerilla warfare, that the author would spend more time describing organization, ideology, tactics, etc. I found myself skipping many sections just because I've already read much better books dealing with the particular subjects. It was useful as a primer as to insurgencies about which I know very little. Overall, the book was disappointing.Not recommended."
2,A very biased book,"I read this book, here in Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I like to read books, even when they aren't dedicated to agricultural subjects.This book is very biased.The best in this book, is the chapter dedicated to author's participation in Vietnam war.The chapters dedicated to the author in USA government are weak and biased."
4,I didn't like the aftertaste of the Viactiv ...,"I didn't like the aftertaste of the Viactiv Soft Calcium Chews. I feel this product takes too much effort for most people. We know we need our vitamins and minerals, but don't want to spend all day taking them. Maybe if it were just one chew per day, it would be better. The idea of chewing them is great, though."
4,This is a great product. It tastes really ...,"This is a great product. It tastes really good, like a little chocolate chew, and I'm getting my 500 mg of calcium as well. I will definitely purchase this product in the future. It's way better than taking those 500 mg calcium horse pills. I'll recommend this to everyone I know."
5,This has got to be the best calcium ...,"This has got to be the best calcium chew ever!!! It not only has a great taste, but it takes away any sweet tooth cravings you might have. The smooth texture is also a definite plus."
4,I love this product. It gives woman over ...,"I love this product. It gives woman over half of the calcium we need and it tastes just like a chocolate treat. I don't think there are other products like this on the market yet. It definitely has advantages over taking a pill -- you can satisfy your chocolate craving with only 20 calories, and lots of calcium and vitamins D and K. Just pop one for a late afternoon snack and you're on your way to being healthy instead of pigging out on junk food."
5,No value here!,"There are no value packs available on Amazon for the Swaddlers or the Cruisers! So, the $10.49 is overpriced! Time to go to Target and Sams!"
1,leaking,"My son use this diaper these days. It leaks like crazy!!! I have to change his diaper during midnight so often because it leaks so bad. Even I just change his diaper less than two hours ago, my son's outfit get wet again. It is really bad."
2,Leak!!!!!,"I bought these diapers when they were cheap. I used the baby-dry for a long time. When I bought the swaddlers, I didn't look carefully. Otherwise I won't buy them. When they came, I kind of like them the flexity. But when my daughter has bowl movements, the poops leak. It is a big mess. I have to clean her and wash the clothes. So I will not buy them again, back to baby-dry. And it is expensive now. Costco has a better deal than here with big pack."
1,Poor review,"I had to return this product, the same day it was received. The tuning function for the AM/FM radio did not work."
2,"Not if you like hard rock, metal, stoner or anything ""heavy""","I had to give up my wonderful 10 yr old Sony for ERROR reasons. Rather than pay outrageous prices for a fix or refurbish, I shopped around for a new model. This received such good reviews that I bought it. I am disappointed.Sure it makes the house vibrate. But it sounds better one floor below me than it does in my own apartment. If you like pop, classical, etc, buy it. But if you're like me and you enjoy heavier sounds, the equalizer plus X Bass cannot help you.For all of its supposed power...it just creates a lot of vibration."
4,Great adaption!,"The only bad thing is that the ending was not like the book at all. Other than that, the movie is great!"
4,smooth ride,"The score was great, and the boy who played Archie was terrific.If I had not read the book, however, I would not have been interested in this movie. The ending was completely different from that in the book. In the book, there was no resolution! The bad guys were not punished! No black marbel was pulled out! And Archie did win. I don't know how I feel about the film versions's ending. But I was very impressed with Archie's character's entire performance."
2,movie doesn't match the book,I ordered this movie to show my high school students for after reading the novel. I was really disappointed that the movie has a completely different ending than the book. I wish they would remake the movie to be accurate.
2,Sort of Dissappointing,"Well, the book was wonderful really dark and the movie was not, I dont think it captured the characters in the book very well and the book is definetly more exciting, I mean I had to watch the movie in halves because the first time I ended up falling asleep. If you have read the book its nice to watch it but it will make you very angry at the end. They completely change the ending and in turn, I think, change the message and darkness of Robert Cormier's book. I really think that they traded in the moral of the story to please a crowd that likes happier endings."
2,Disappointing Chocolate War Movie,"As a freshman English teacher I was very disappointed that the ending of The Chocolate War story was completely changed in the film. By allowing Jerry Renault to gain justice over Archie,The Vigils, and Brother Leon, the entire theme of the book was changed. I showed the movie to my class after we had read the book and we talked about how some writers and producers in the American entertainment industry cannot bear an unhappy or unjust ending of a story although we see this all around us in everyday life. The changed ending also takes away the powerful message in the book against the bullies of this world. Why would someone do this to a fantastic book? B. Elliott"
1,Never received from Amazon. 1star for Amazon,Ordered 11/19/2006. Shipment kept being delayed. I ended up cancelling the 11/19/2006 order today.
5,ANOTHER LOOK,"HE FELL INTO A VAT OF CHOCOLATE.....AND HE YELLED ""FIRE!""ASKED WHY HE YELLED FIRE,HE SAID ""WHO WOULD HELP ME IF I YELLED 'CHOCOLATE'"""
5,A Sense of Duty is the most beautiful and touching true story.,"I was overwhelmed. It touched me dearly because my father was put in hard labor ""reeducation camp"" like his. I escaped Vietnam in a little fisherman boat and reached the Philippine's shore after one week on the rough South China Sea. Quang works hard, learns more, does the right thing and he earns a fully respect. Great true story! It's great for everyone to read."
3,Whew!,"Whew! Quang has had to obviously overcome a lot of obstacles to get to where he is today. My hat is off to him for his accomplishments. There was a definite dichotomy in his views: a love and hate for his native country and adopted one, which made his book that much more interesting for historical as well as personal exploration."
4,Fascinating perspective,"As a Marine veteran of the war, naturally I was attracted to the prospect of reading this book. It definitely helps to fill in some gaps in the total picture. Personally I always felt that there were a number of very effective ARVN and South Vietnamese allies that performed admirably under difficult circumstances and given little credit. After all for them, it wasn't a question of just serving for one year. Also in return trips to Vietnam as well as here in Hawaii, I have met a number of former South Vietnamese military men as well as civilians who had to endure very lengthy periods of ""re-education"" just as the author's father did. Although the transition for many immigrants was not easy, many of those that remain continue to pay the price. All in all a fine book that is well worth reading!"
5,"Powerful, personal view of Vietnam","Quang has done us all a service by writing this quite powerful memoir. If you're interested in Vietnam and/or the American warrior class, this punchy account is a must-have."
1,straight garbage,this guy was garbage as soon as he started saying that he a from atlanta when he is from augusta. this guy is a lame man and so is his music. he talks about the same stuff. i want even take a free copy. holla
3,Useful Information written at Length,"The book does provide helpful information that is at first easy to read.However, only about 40% of the book will keep your attention as the writing gets confusing.The book also talks about herbs that no one would really use.Books like this could be written for all who want to learn about overcoming anxiety but the fact that there are virtually no books on the subject that appeal to the layman testify that those knowledgable on the subject are too high-minded to reach out to all American's and teenagers in particular facing wide spread psychologiccal hardship.This book gets 3 stars for being the only one of its kind to make a qualified attempt."
2,Very Basic,"I was disappointed with this one. Everyone else liked it. I just thought it was very plain, and became bored with it quickly. If you suffer from anxiety check out ""Embracing the Fear""..."
3,Good Buy,"This cd only has one song I wanted (Sunny), but I couldn't find it anywhere else. I am happy with the purchase."
2,haven't heard these before?,"There's a good reason: they were never hits and they weren't much good in the first place. Reading the blurb with this release might lead you to believe the tracks are lost classics, but really, it's all strictly second (or third) division. Listening to ""Motown Connoisseurs"" only calls to mind the great tracks of Motown's heyday, none of which are on this release."
5,Another Great FF Soundtrack,"Disc One (46:10)1) Monster Farm (Bandneon version) 4:282) Ivalice, the Other World (Piano version) 4:193) Crystal (Quena version) 3:434) Mewt (Acoustic guitar version) 4:045) Please Teach Me Montblanc (Fagot version) 4:226) Marche (Love for humanity version) 3:597) Main Theme (Piano version) 4:088) No Lack of Suspense (Electric guitar version) 4:099) The Wilderness Beyond (Bandneon version) 4:2110) The Place We Should Go Back To (Invincible version) 3:4011) Amber Valley (Sing me softly version) 4:48"
3,Decent but not a miracle cleaner.,"I bought this because of advertisement and reviews that it could clean oil (the kind from your skin), off screens. It cleans my screen well but did not remove the oil prints. Just to clarify, the oil prints are transfers from my keyboard to the screen of my laptop."
2,Does a ok job.,I've tried various methods/products to clean eyepieces & the corrector plate of my SCT. ROR does clean pretty well but... This product does leave residue which can be easily removed with 99% alcohol. The major problem with ROR is the price. It simply not worth it. Almost $12 for a tiny 2oz bottle. Will not buy again.
1,Let Down,"I completely understand and agree with what Dr. Haberstroh was saying in his book, BUT the way in which he approached the subject and displayed his evidence was unprofessional. Unfortunately, Dr. Haberstroh became quite obsessed with the idea of using his book as a tool to ""trash-talk"" his mortal enemy Dr. Key. (Dr. Key is a strong believer of ""subliminal advertising"" who actively travels the country giving guest lectures and writing many books about this subject. Dr. Key is fueling the fire about the myths of subliminal advertising.) It was very difficult to write my 25 page research paper over a book that was written at about 7th grade level. It was pure torture to force myself to read this book."
1,Not inspiring,"It is not my nature to be overly critical, but this book is less than inspiring. Readers who really want to explore the ""truth"" about subliminal advertising should take a look at ""The Secret Sales Pitch,"" available on Amazon. I quoted Haberstroh quite a bit, mostly to illustrate how absurd advertisers seem when they deny using subliminal techniques."
5,"Compelling, Truthful Journalism","Mumia Abu-Jamal is one of the country's most governmentally-opposed, but most insightful journalists and historians. His writing is masterful. His voice is compelling, as heard on the accompanying CD of audio recordings of his essays. His dedication to his writing, and presenting honest history of the oppressed and of American racism and injustice offers us amazing texts that otherwise are not being taken on by publishers in the amounts they ought to be. Mumia accomplishes more behind bars than most writers on the outside do. I've bought many copies of this book to give as gifts: to transform readers understandings and perspectives. This volume is that profound."
1,Some murderers are intelligent and insightful ....,"Abu-Jamal is an intelligent and insighful man, and the book is thought-provoking at times, but do people really know the details of the murder case that made him a celebrity? To me it does matter who the author of a work is. Please, look into the primary sources as I have since drinking the Abu-Jamal Cool-Aid along with many others. Racism, classism, and punishment for being outspoken all may be issues our society must work to eliminate from our criminal justice system, but they're not the reason Abu-Jamal was convicted. I am sick that I was duped and will not read more by Abu-Jamal."
5,An American Classic,"I just bought this flag for use in a series of videos I've been making. The primary reason that I've been able to rotate as many in as I have is a product of the three by five feet polyester flags being as cheap to purchase as they are. In my view, if you can get one for less than five bucks you're doing well. I love the physical beauty of ""Don't Give Up the Ship"" though. The quote originally comes from the War of 1812 wherein American Commander of the Chesapeake, Captain James Lawrence, told his men to fire faster and not to give up the ship as he lay dying. Inspired by his final words, they were turned into a flag by Commodore Perry during the Battle of Lake Eerie. It's an American classic and makes for a worthy possession."
1,This set bored me,"I got into bellydancing as a workout through Veena and Neena's video and have tried many others since. Always excited for something new, I got this entire set immediately. I find the names for some of the videos a bit weird and the music is lousy, and the set very uninspiring, but more importantly the workouts are really boring. I was bored with the first viewing and couldn't stay awake for the second time. There is a routine on all of them, but it has completely nothing to do with what you are taught, which is a waste of time. Don't waste your money on these videos. I recommend Veena and Neena's Sensual videos, Dolphina's Goddess Workout videos and Shamira's video over these. Each of these videos will teach you to bellydance, while giving you a workout and will teach you a routine YOU can learn!"
2,I Was Disappointed...,"I'm REALLY surprised at the positive reviews this video set has gotten. As a bellydancer, and daughter of a 20 year certified bellydance instructor, I have to say Rania is one of the WORST professional bellydancers I have seen. I can't believe she has 10 years experience and other videos. She moves like a robot! As far as the workout, each tape has it's fun moments, but they don't last. Pure Sweat is like a bad salsa class with little to no bellydancing, Cardio Shimmy is no fun, Bellydance Boogie & Hip Hop Drop are enjoyable here and there, but the repetitive moves irritate me. The cueing is bad. Alot of the music is ""elevator""-ish. The warm-ups and cool-downs are lacking. This video set is fine if you don't know what bellydancing is SUPPOSSED to look like, but if you do, the mechanical movements can at times be distracting. These are definately for people who aren't serious about bellydancing and just want a different kind of dance workout."
1,Missing notes,"I like Harrell and Ashkenazy's playing of the sonatas. The 1 star is because the recording of the Rondo finale of the G minor sonata (8:12) is missing the first note and part of the duration of the second note at the very beginning. It's hard to imagine these seasoned veterans re-interpreting a well known work like this (and I have heard many other recordings as well as seen the score), so the only explanation is that someone bungled while editing the recording and cut off the 0.5 seconds of music at the start of the finale. This appears to be true of both the CD and mp3 versions. I had a hard time explaining this to the Amazon customer service representative, so I just paid $1 and bought the same track played my Emmanuel Ax and Yo Yo Ma (which thankfully is not missing this imperfection) - a bit of a band-aid fix. So, if you're a perfectionist, beware!Beethoven: Complete Sonatas for Piano & Cello."
1,NEVER received the bracelets,Do not go through what I did!!! I never received my order and they could care less. They canceled my order and told me they had no control over when the orders left. I waited patiently way too long just to have them act like whatever and just cancel it all on their own.
3,Sub Dewalt Quality,The blade is thick and cuts slowly. The blade doesn't cut as cleanly as I assumed a continuous diamond blade should; it just gets the job done.
1,Waste of Money & Time,"As far as outlining software goes, this product is a waste of money and time.Paste and copy is barely functional. It is replete with errors which convert both words and whole sentences into symbols. Various functions do not work as intended.In addition, if you reformat your computer, you can expect the license to expire resulting in the software no longer working. You then have to deal with an uncooperative customer support with no gaurantee that they will reactivate it without additional payment. There is no option for deactivation, unlike other software available."
4,Decent key cabinet,"No frills key box and decent price. Shipment was quick. Only problem is stickers and key tags are of low quality, would have liked to see them match the quality of the steel box, but they are passable."
1,wrong item,i was told by lift master this is what i needed. then when i hooked it all up and made sure it was hooked up right they said i have the wrong part. can i return this?
3,Poor range,"The range on this was pretty poor. When setting this up - with the opener unplugged - the range was pretty good. However, as soon as I plugged the opener in, the range got terrible. It's possible this was due to interference from the existing opener, but nonetheless, it didn't work well for me.I had to add a length of wire to the remote, and eventually even moved the unit as close to the door as I could. Even then, it usually took a lot of tries to get the door to open from the car."
3,Range Bad,Set-up was very easy.The range is probably 10 to 15 feet. I used several different remotes including the homelink in the car.It works better when you want to close the door than open it.I assume I will have to extend the antenna like another reviewer did.My best guess is they re-engineered or changed manufacturers within the last year.All the 2009 reviews were good.
2,"Works okay, but not what I was looking for...","I wanted to replace an older GDO receiver that is not Homelink compatible. I wanted a receiver that would work with my Homelink-equipped cars. I bought this receiver, but discovered that it also is not Homelink-compatible. My fault: I didn't research it properly. Second problem: this receiver has a built-in AC plug on the back side. You must have an AC outlet that you can plug it into. The outlet next to my GDO is too close to the GDO motor unit to allow this receiver to be plugged into the outlet. So I had to install it on the garage wall about 15 feet away and string the cable (provided) to the GDO motor unit. That works, but is not a very neat way to install the receiver. So I bought a Homelink-compatible receiver elsewhere. Wasted my money on this one. Someday maybe I'll figure out a use for this one..."
2,Hard on newborns!,"I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital and the first diaper I used was he Pampers Swaddlers for newborns, because they have a hole cut into them for ambilical cord protection. Then I switched to the Baby Dry Pampers, just to try them out.I knew as soon as I took the first one off of my daughter that I would never use them again! The plastic they are made of rubbed on my little ones legs and left angry red marks around her thigh area. Newborns have enough stress without having to wear an uncomfortable diaper! The Pampers Swaddlers are made with a clothlike material that doesn't chafe and they holdup great! Sure they cost a little more, but they are worth every penny if they keep my child comfortable!"
3,OK workout,This is just not one of my favorite workouts. It isn't bad just not really intense and motivating. I really think Tamilee is good but this is not her best work. I get more from my Firm workouts.
2,DVD format ruins it,"When I purchased this video, I was looking for a good, quick cardio workout to do before going to work. It takes FOREVER to get to the actual workout and there is no way to skip over the long company intro. The workout itself is fine. Tamilee Webb's experience shows in her seamless cues. Some of it is a little cheesy, but challenging. However, I am not impressed enough with the workout to regularly endure the long intro. It is okay for a weekend when I have more time, but unused otherwise."
1,Not worth your money/trouble ...,"With the exception of one of the last pages of the book: ""Information from the Author"", the rest of the book is a repetitive sequence of whining by the author.I have tinnitus too (from playing in bands in night clubs for years), and yes, it's quite annoying at times, but two things really annoyed me about the writing style of this book:1. The style is just one continuous sequence of the author whining about her contion; I really feel for anyone who has tinnitus, but if we all carried on like the author did, we'd all be dead!2. The annoying third person style made me hope that the author goes to writing school before attempting another book. I understand that the style of third person writing can be very effective, but in this case, it just added to point number 1 for me..."
3,Rockport Waterton,Looked and felt good out of the box but do not stand up to long use--leather on cap toe developed creases. Still wear them but they do not look great.
1,Where's Paul?,"I'll keep it short. I have only read half of this book so far, and can not adequately convey how annoyed I am that this definitive biography appears to have been written without interviewing this LIVING musical genius. When not citing the many Brits who put Paul up for the night (or the week, or the month, etc.) during his wanderings in England, there is only filler in the form of unremarkable prose; was Paul Simon interviewed for this book? I will have to trudge through the second-half of the book to find out. Very disappointing use of the word definitive in the title."
4,The Disney Philosopher,The book was a good book. I used this book as a research guide and it was very clear and full of information.
5,Good Book!,"I have heard a lot about this book that I decided to get it. The result was quite good, it is interesting and easy to read..."
3,book stracth and cut in the side,"Excellent book, a new book doesnt have any scrath or cut, it's a shame 'cause the book was a gift"
4,A marvelous description of a life's journey,The author provides a vivid description of the everyday convertion of the soul of Lucano from his infance to the eyeopening epifany.A great story!
4,Pleased with the purchase,"While choosing my kitchen faucet, the top contenders were the Grohe pullout, the Hansgrohe pullout, and this (the Danze Opulence). I am very glad that I chose the Danze. The price was about half of the others, and this faucet has a very distinct, beautiful look, especially in a more ""traditional""-looking kitchen. The stainless steel color matched my appliances. The pullout hose is braided plastic, not braided steel (which I would have preferred), but it is sturdy and heavy, not flimsy. There is no problem with water splashing from the sink and the sprayer works well.I took off a star because the black rubber piece that covers the sprayer on/off button on top of the faucet does not stay on very well."
2,THE HANDLE FELL OFF!,"When I first bought this faucet, I was extremely pleased with how nice it looked, especially for the reasonable price. But now, little more than four months after I purchased it, the handle fell off and won't screw back in. This is practically brand new and I'm already having problems. I'm going to have to check now to see if there's a warranty. this is very annoying because if I need to replace it, I'm going to have to spend even more money on a plumber to reinstall it. BUYER BEWARE! I strongly recommend you buy a different brand."
4,Beautiful Faucet!!,This Danze faucet looks beautiful with my new Blanco Siligranite sink in Anthracite. There are very few black kitchen faucets out there to choose from but this one is beautiful! My plumber said it was fairly easy to install. Since we have only had it for less than a week I cannot speak for its longevity but hopefully it was last for years and years. The reason that I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star was that it is easy to spray yourself if you have the water on while trying to reinsert the pull out sprayer. I have learned from experience to just turn the water off first before reattaching the pull out sprayer. I love this faucet!
2,Bite golf sandals,Ordered this product because the price was right. But found out that it was like the old saying goes. You only get what you pay for. The shoes are very uncomfortable. I tried them on and they seemed to fit okay so I wore them for a game of golf. By the time I had walked 3 holes I knew I had a problem. They became very tight and had no give whatsoever. My feet started to hurt and by the fifth hole I was actualy in pain. Couldn't wait to get back to the car and get them off. Would never recommend them. But because I had worn them once I was not able to send them back so am stuck with the shoe. Will try to find someone who might like a stiff shoe or else will have to throw them out. Last time I will order anything like this on line.
1,Bite golf sandal,I would rate this sandal with 5 stars if I could get the correct size. I was mailed a size 5 when I ordered size 7.
3,Bite Golf Sandals,"While the sandals were what I wanted...color, looks...the fit was never quite right. The first pair I ordered were too big, the second pair were the right fit, but I have a high instep and the velcro straps that secured the foot just weren't long enough to reach the coordinating velcro. I absolutely would have kept them if I could have. So far the service of Amazon.com and TGW has been excellent. It was my first experience."
1,too big,these sandals run too big I always wear a size 8 these are at least a 9 or more I have 2 inches of sandal after my toes.
2,Golf Sandals,"I have purchased other Bite sandals and loved them, this particular pair, however, is constructed very long in the toe giving the sandal a ""too big"" appearance. More importantly, the sandals caused severe blisters on my heel during the very first and only wearing. Unfortunately, I am unable to wear them."
1,BITE golf sandals,"Although I have been very happy with my regular BITE sandals, their golf sandals were extremely disappointing. The fit didn't correspond at all to the fit of the regular ones--even though the strap design was identical. I couldn't even try an exchange, because it was impossible to figure out what size would have been correct. They were way too narrow, and extremely long. Won't try BITE shoes online again......got ""bit"" for return shipping charge."
3,Golf sandals,Not real comfortable. Probably not a good idea to get something before trying it on. Don't care for the extended toe on them.
5,Hope for fundamentalists,This book could mean hope for the fundamentalists. If they take this book to heart maybe they will find a more loving God. I loved the book. I would also recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet; but only for those people who enjoyed this book. The Encounter is way too far advanced for the fundamentalist to start off with. Again this is a wonderful work.
3,Social Triune God,"This book is very interesting and enlightening however, only a strong Christian should embark on this journey. Although it sheds light on many passages of the Bible, it also tends to strip away the deity of Christ and can be considered blasphemous. Approach with caution."
3,As a fundamentalist,"I enjoyed the book immensely and found it quite interesting and helpful. I don't however see major changes to fundamentalist doctrine in order to accommodate false doctrine. There is a major difference between translation of scripture and interpretation of scripture. It certainly opens some ideas, but it is not for the new or weak Christian, since it is replete with stumbling blocks to spiritual growth. Because Aramaic is by its nature a metaphoric language (so is English, but not nearly so), does not mean every idea couched in metaphorical terms can be interpreted any way you want. There are definite concrete foundations such as the doctrine of sin, which is what most liberals would like to be rid of."
5,Highly recommend,If you are serious about bible studies this is the book to have! It is easy to understand and I love it!
4,good to have one.,"I had this book many years earlier. gave it to some one and needed to get one again. Very informative to understand some of the cultural differences from the western countries, for example eating one's flesh and drinking ones blood. and the stone heads."
4,A good whodunit,"Peter Proctor, a retired Member of Parliament, is attempting to write his memoirs but he is constantly plagued by what is known to be the ""writer's block"". Very soon, Peter realises that his block is due to the fact that his mind is constantly distracted by what happened thirty years before when he was active with the Foreign Office. At that time, he used to work together with a young aristocrat called Timothy Wycliffe. Tim lived in an elegantly furnished apartment in Belgravia until he was savagely murdered by a person or persons unknown. Thirty years later, Peter can't accept that Timothy was allegedly beaten to death by one of his boyfriends. And so begins a fast-paced enquiry, as Peter tries to unveil the truth that lies behind this mysterious murder.Mr Barnard's novel, beside being a witty and extremely well constructed mystery, gives the reader a fascinating view of British society in the 1950s and its changing as well as unchanging moves since."
4,"Good guitar learning book, not to complicated. Anyone could use it","I've read a few guitar how to books, this was a fairly good one. You don't need to know how to read music and beginners to moderate skilled players would benefit from it.It is pretty straight forward, the meat and potatoes for me was the part where the author gets to the basic cord and scales that you ""must know"".A good resource that you can go through fairly quickly and pick up some good skills. The CD has some tracks on it that are useful as well if you have a CD play handy."
2,Short on Substance,"I am experienced guitar player. The title of this book promised a list of useful tips for someone who has been playing the guitar for a while. Instead, the book provides a only a free-formed discussion aimed at beginners. Still, I read the book in anticipation of learning something useful ""that I should have been told."" I was disappointed to find the book to be little other than a pep talk telling the reader to forget about ""academic"" learning and play from the heart. While it seems like the author spends half the book denigrating the learning of scales, about the only real substance in the entire book is in the several pages devoted to scales. Without these much-maligned scales, where is the player supposed to find the notes for expression?"
4,A little bit of complexity Change,This book explore the ways and difficulties about change organization in a systemic perspective. It's very incisive and gabe some tools and advices too.
2,Nice leather and stitching but too bulky,"I bought this wallet based on all those four- and five-star reviews and have to disagree. While the manufacture of the wallet is well stitched and high-quality leather, it is a flawed design. This wallet is about a half-inch larger all around than most wallets and it doesn't fold in half very well. The fold is weak and tends to slip compared to smaller wallets. After one day of use mine is already losing its shape. Perhaps this wallet was designed for the larger Euro currency as opposed to US bills. The description should emphasize the larger size of this wallet for the unsuspecting consumer. I am truly disappointed and sorry to lose $75."
5,Very fine wallet,"Very nice Italian leather wallet. Ample room for credit cards, business cards, plus the flip out ID. Very happy with purchase.Update 1/4/2013Well... I think this is a fine piece of leather. Maybe I didn't take care of it. I don't know. I'm not hard on stuff, usually. But my wallet turned black, and the edges have frayed off. It looks awful now. I now have to replace it and I'm disappointed."
4,"Contains up-tempo, jazz, soul and big ballads","Combines the usual up-tempo swinging arrangements, some jazzy reworking's, plus her usual soulful performance with her great style and interpretation with her ballads. Special mention should go to her backing singers Madeline Bell and Lesley Duncan who do a superb job with supporting vocals.The recording (They Long To Be) Close To You is yet another example of how Dusty's voice was a perfect match for Bacharach's melodies and also for David's lyrics.Dusty took the honours with If You Go Away for her style and interpretation, such is the power of her performance that the song is more closely associated with her than it is with any other artist who has recorded it."
5,The Write Environment: Featuring an interview with Phil Rosenthal,Length:: 4:28 MinsHere's a preview of the DVD.
4,Excellent reference book,"I am enjoying this book immensely. It fills a real need in the literature of automatic sequences. The references and end notes at each chapter conclusion are very useful. Basically this book brings together a lot of disparate ideas and forms them into a coherent and well laid out presentation. My only reservation with the book is that there are minor errors with some of the proofs that can be annoying (but easily fixable). The style is accessible, the ideas are fast moving and the comprehensiveness of ideas and references is inspirational. Definitely worth purchasing."
5,Saved my electronics,"I had a power surge in my house, when the electric company didn't tighten a wire to a new transformer. This surge suppressor saved my tv, blu-ray player, stereo, dvd recorder & cable box. It fried the suppressor & the company had a new one to me within a week of my calling them. I wish I would have had the same brand suppressor on my computer & bedroom dvd player, because those things were not saved. I should actually buy them for all the electronic stuff I had to replace, which included a fridge, stove, water softener, alarm clock, etc. I have since put APC on my computer & am buying more for work."
3,Okay outlet for general purpose.,It's a good standard surge protector. Quality is good and I use with with all my computers. My only complaint is that they raised the price from $9.99 to $13+ something. They should also have 1 output turned to the side so that you can get one of those nasty large transformers in there without taking up 3 slots.
4,Good Mid-level surge protector for everyday things,"For the price, these are good surge suppressors for your average cheap electronics.I would not use this for expensive TVs, Laptops, or items over $1000 as they are not rated for high sensitivity or or large surges"
1,disgusting,"If Christian women are happy in the tiny box that 1960's America was putting them in, then that's great for them. Don't put that on the women who are equal, powerful, NOT CHRISTIAN, and human just like men.Free yourself from a man-centric world, it doesn't have to be that way, and no one, not even something called ""god"" should tell you to be less than you are or less than you want to be."
1,A Terrible Book,"I only gave this book 1 star because there was no option of giving it zero stars. I wish there was, becuase this is an awful book. Save your money."
1,best avoided,"this was a waste of money. the print is so microscopic and flawed that the bangla words are more or less unreadable, and when they *are* readable it's perplexing why they opted to list highly literate translations of everyday words instead of the ones that are actually used. avoid."
4,Inclusive ballet book- nice message,"My daughter (age five) really liked this book. It, and it's companion bok ""Best Friends Wear Pink Tutus,"" are both very nice stories that are simple, and show how friends can have fun together and enjoy ballet. I think the friendship part is actually more central, but if your child is interested in ballet, this is a way to empahisize the good things abuot friendship, while using ballet as the thing to get them reading."
3,My niece picked this out for herself,"Gotta say, the girls in this book are a little preoccupied with their appearance.And I don't find it very interesting to read.But if your children are into dance right now, check it out - they might like this one."
3,"Ok, but not great","I am not sure why this book is touted as ""world"" folk tales. A few stories make vague references to another culture, but most do not give the impression of being anywhere in particular. Ninety-percent of the characters are animals - the most prevalent being a tiger and this or that animal. After reading a few, they all sound the same, with obscure end-of-story morals that most young children cannot comprehend. Some are even a little scary for a young child. Incidentally, a few of the stories mention God. Also, many of the stories are too long for bedtime."
4,cute book,"I bought this book to complete my order for the free shipping. It has cute stories. It is nice to have a selection of one pagers to four pagers to choose from depending on your child's mood. I gave it four out of five stars because I am reading it to a 9mo. old and it could use a little better formatting. If you want something for a child that needs to look at something, there is never enough picture for the story length."
4,Great for bedtime,"These stories are a great length for my 4 year olds bedtime routine. I used to get bogged down in extra long stories, but now I can zip through our routine and he's satisfied. The stories are great. There was some repetition in the tiger stories, but beyond that I have no complaints."
4,Pinto Prods Thinking,"This book is a collection of essays, some of which I had seen before. Jim and I bounce ideas back and forth monthly in preparation for columns he sends to Automation World magazine. It's interesting to see his thoughts come together. The contents of this book are wide ranging but reflect his passion for good manufacturing and good business practices. I consider it a good read for the beginning of my own thought processes. Jim tries to prod readers into thinking about what they are doing and where their companies (and their careers) are going. Read it and get stirred up about manufacturing and what you are going to do to improve things."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Buckland was bucking for a paycheck on this one. The sigils are cheated out by using two start circles or two end lines on them, some of them are even SIDWAYS.Frankly, it seems as if he had contemplated plagiarism before publishing the book, then someone told him he'll get sued, so he decided to add his resources last minute & screw the corrections on all of the images he changed by 10 percent!I had to give this book one star because the drop down menu wouldn't allow for NO STARS.Buckland knows better than to publish a complete pile of poop for the Magickal Community without getting a firm correction from his peers.Do not waste your money on this book. Take your time and *research* what symbols you are in need of. Buckland's got his bibliography down, but he does NOT COPY THE INFORMATION properly.Honestly, sticking to Magickal Tables, the Goetia, (etc.) would have been a smarter move on my part. I had given him the benefit of the doubt and I was sadly disappointed."
4,Very Good Book!!,"This is an excellent, well written, easy to understand and browse, thoroughly enjoyable book. i gave it 4 stars because there weren't very many omens covered, but if you want this book for things like magical alphabets or ancient scripts or sybols and their meanings, id definitely suggest it!"
4,Great Read!,"I enjoy reading/studying about the 'abnormal' topics. It has a great amount of symbols in the book along with the meaning behing them, I got a lot of great painting ideas behind it!"
1,"Sadly, the Shinto reference is wrong","I did a search inside this book for ""Shinto"" and what I see looks wrong.I think the Shinto references need updating. The information is in error in this book. Shinto as a ""state religion"" was nationalized in the Meiji period, but as a spirituality it is indigenous to Japan. It survived 6th century introduction of Buddhism from China, but Shinto beliefs were in already in place in many areas of Japan.Two shinto texts, The Kojiki (Record of Ancient Matters) andthe Shoku Nihongi and its Nihon Shoki (Continuing Chronicles of Japan) date from the eighth century.Yes, the government and shintoism was separated after 1945, but the shrines, core belief systems and shrines that had operated for hundreds of years still exist.I am more inclined to agree with other writers such as Joseph Campbell, and Thomas Kasulis' study of Shinto from the University of Hawaii Press (2004)."
4,MORE OF A COLLECTOR'S ITEM,I purchased this toy for my son who is really into Kingdom Hearts. He's 11 & so it really is not used as a play thing but rather something that sits on a shelf that gets played with on a rare occasion. He really likes it's appearance as it looks like the character it represents. His favorite feature? The removable keyblade!
3,goos for your eyes.,"It is very common that when you use a half mask respirator you get a lot of dust between the repirator and the unprotected area of your face especially your eyes and nose, with this full mask seems like no more dust into my eyes.The only part that i don't like is the rubber strips that holds the respirator on your head thel look pretty fragil (cheap rubber) we'll see after a few wearings."
4,Want to Know a Secret? How about 26?,"Length:: 1:14 MinsI felt like it truly was Mona Lisa speaking to me throughout this fascinating documentary. This narrator's voice along with the fitting music drew me into the story of how photographer and inventor Pascal Cotte photographed the ""Mona Lisa"" at a higher resolution, than any other professional camera, to help reveal all 26 secrets of Leaonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa."" Who wouldn't want to know a secret, let alone 26 ?! It is also intriguing to find out the history behind the ""Mona Lisa"" painting. The extra knowledge I learned from this film was amazing! Finally, Pascal Cotte uncovered what so many individuals have questioned and found to be a mystery about the world's most famous painting."
5,finally,"At last the 91 series is finally coming out. I remember watching every inning of all seven games as a kid, and I almost can't wait to do so again. This was the best world series ever played and now people can remember why. I'm personally looking forward to watching Black Jack's (Jack Morris) game 7 pitching gem, and Brian Harper's play at the plate in game 4. If you're a baseball fan you'll love watching this series over and over again."
1,Prouct Review,"Tori Amos is the worst person that has ever lived on this planet. I bought this as a gift as a friend, and was made to watch it. I wanted to punch a baby right in the face."
5,A Treasure from the Tori Archives,"Tori Amos is a Goddess to those who are lucky enough to be acquainted with her work. Here, we get to see 2 performances at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early in her career. The set lists are nearly identical, but to see how she has grown as a performer from one year to the next is just an awesome experience. You cheer for her when she stops in the middle of a song to tell two members of the audience to be quiet. You cry when she sings Me and a Gun. You get chills all the rest of the time. This is a must for any Tori lover and if you are new to Tori, this is an excellent place to start.To whoever released this DVD: Thank you for preserving a piece of modern musical history."
2,Pulls and crimps hair,"I figured with all the reviews being so high it would be a good one, but it's not. Everytime I straighten my hair, the hair gets caught in the bulky screws and the plates are not smoothe. I thurts and I feel like my hair is being really damaged. The curling iron part has such a big lip that it put a crimp in your hair every time you roll it around teh barrel. Ill be returning mine."
4,Very handy.,"Very handy cause it's 2-in-1,but the curl is a little two big for me, and the straightener doesn't work as good as the curler."
3,An okay product...,"I recieved this straightener as a Christmas present. Less than a year later, it has broken. The hinge mechanism came apart and I couldn't gigure out how to put it back together. When it was functional, it worked fairly well on my wavy hair. My hair tends not to hold a style well, but the straightening held up fairly well throughout a day at school. The curling iron did not always work that well, often, when I arrived at school the curls kind of died. Another issue is the clip that keeps the plates together when using it as a curling iron. The clip did not always keep the plates together, causing me to burn myself. The clip area also somethimes snagged my hair while straightening. The curling iron is certainly an innovative idea, but poorly executed. The hot outside plates often created a hazard for me while I straightened. All in all, it was probably worth what it cost. I would reccomend a more expensive straightener for someone serious about her hair."
2,Doesn't work well as cylindrical iron...,"If you want this iron primarily for a flat iron, I don't think you will be disappointed. However, when I tried to use it as a round iron, it was very difficult to get the two halves to latch together, and even when I succeeded, they didn't stay that way. Thus, I really don't use it anymore. It was inexpensive, so I don't consider this to be a major loss."
1,bad design,I bought this product becuase I had good past experience with a conair iron/straigtener. This one however makes it necessary to hold the straightener shut while opening and closing the iron. It heats well but isn't worth the trouble.
1,Waste of money,"This product does straighten my hair if nothing else goes wrong.However, it does not work as a curling iron -- the barrel and the arm that hold the hair to the iron do not fit well together. Hair does not stay ""clamped"" in the iron when I try to curl it around the barrel.When using it as a straightener, hair gets caught under the hot plates and has to be ripped out before it completely burns off. I'm not exaggerating. This has happened more than once.Also, the dial for the heat setting broke off after just a few months.It's dirt cheap, though, so if you're only going to use it a few times a year (or less), it might be worth it. Maybe."
2,Not so great for fine hair...,"My hair is baby fine, and I found that when I tried to straighten it, my hair would just slip right through the iron! It doesn't curl well either. It's a great idea, and might work better for people with thicker hair, but I found it to be a waste. :("
3,Great for the price!,"You have to be extremely careful with it because it gets really hot. However, in my opinion it takes a super long time to heat up. However this product is great if you are on a college student budget. :D"
5,curling iron/straightener,This is my second iron of this model and I love it. My first one still works after many years of daily use. I purchased a second one to keep at my vacation home.
4,Good Straightener,This works good as a straightener. As a curling iron not so good. But still a very neat idea.
2,"Difficult to use, doesn't curl","I bought this combination curling/straightening iron because I thought it would super convenient. My problem with this item is that it's a bit unwieldy. This product will be mostly used by women who have smaller hands. I find that the handle is just a bit too fat for me to hold it comfortably while working the lever.Also, the despite having a ""cool"" tip, it's hard to switch between the curling and the straightening feature without burning yourself a little.Finally, the curling feature doesn't clamp down properly. When I release the lever to clamp down on my hair and then curl it, my hair just slides sliding right off the barrel."
5,Not sure what I'll do if they stop selling this!,"I bought one of these randomly when I was in highschool years ago. It has become the only hair styling tool I swear by. I can't imagine trying to straighten sections, then have to plug in a separate curler to curl. It takes seconds to switch between the two on this. I've since bought 3 in a row, each lasting me at least 2 years. There was one I bought that was glitchy and would shut off by itself, but that's my only complaint. I always get compliments on my hair and I tell people it takes so much less time than they would think with this tool. Love it. I'm so glad Amazon has it because I cannot find it in stores anymore!"
2,Not up to par,"I have the Conair CD99, and wanted another one to travel with. I ran across this, so I purchased it. It isn't nearly as 'friendly' as the CD99, the switch to use the flat iron is really hard to use at the end of the iron as opposed to the CD99, which is right on the handle. Like it? Not so much."
3,Just ok,"Like others who reviewed this product, I bought this curling iron combo to take on a trip to Europe. I needed something with dual voltage. I have to say that while this curling iron/flat iron product does some of both - being a curling iron and a flat iron, it really doesn't do either very well for my hair. It is a little awkward to use but you get used to it. But I just don't think it does either function as well as other single use products. I have thick, coarse hair, so it may just be me."
2,Not worth it,"This works as your basic, bottom-line flat iron. If you have decent hair to begin with, go for it. But don't expect to get any great curls out of the barrel, because it's too awkward to work with easily. I wasn't happy with its temperature, since I need something REALLY hot to get the job done for my curls. I used it solely as a straighter, and it hurt my hand after a while because the way you have to press it together gets hard to do. It's lasted me a long time with no breaks or anything, but I wouldn't buy it again.If you have difficult-to-manage hair like me, invest in something that's of quality (ask your stylist; I'm going to buy a TS-2). Expect to buy something that can heat to at least 400 degrees and costs aprox $80. If you're up for it."
2,Good while it lasts...,"This product was GREAT for about 6 months. It left my hair smooth and straight (a far cry from poofy and full of friz) and the curling iron feature was excellent. My hair looked really good. However, it stopped heating up after about six months and I had to trash it.. quite a disappointment."
3,Passable Feature Length Film of my FAVORITE cartoon,"The cast is as brilliant as ever, but there really isn't enough plot to hold this together for a feature length film. It's never as ""laugh so hard you think you'll pee yourself"" funny as the cartoons were - nor is there as much in it for the adults as there was in the cartoon. The message is simple - ""be careful what you wish for"" - and I suppose that's fine, it's just that with the acting range of all the voice talents, and the superb quality of the tv series, I was expecting more. This is not at all to say it sucked - it's plenty funny, and I made it through the whole thing, but I haven't memorized it like I have with other recent animation classics like Shrek, and I have no great desire to watch it again.Personally, I'm waiting for the anthology of the series, that's what I really am looking forward to. I LOVE to watch the monkeys dance!"
3,thought this movie was for kids!,"I was disappointed in this movie. I love Nathan Lane and musicals, so I was prepared to be dazzled. Sadly, it was not to be.The kids were puzzled (10, 8 and 4 years old),because many of the jokes and vocabulary were geared for adults. We liked the story line, it had tremendous voice talent. (I have no need to describe the plot as many others have already done so.) The real disappointment was the animation, the characters were really ugly, the facial expressions lacking.The characters were not enjoyable - they were not likeable. The kids were quiet trying to figure it out! I would not spend the money to buy it, it's barely worth renting."
4,A Fun Way to Spend an Afternoon,"We took our four year old daughter to see this, and unlike many other recent children's movie offerings, this movie captivated her attention for the duration of the movie. She enjoyed the story--despite not being a huge Teacher's Pet fan--wasn't frightened by the mad scientist bits, and even seemed to enjoy the songs. Husband and I also enjoyed the little bits of Disney humor thrown into the mix. All of the voice characterizations were great, and Kelsey Grammar and Nathan Lane gave especially lovely performances. All in all, a very enjoyable little movie."
1,No support from Nisus,"Nisus has nice software, but they will not support you. Avoid this stuff !! I wrote them about 10 times after my Nisus crashed, and they just blow you off with short e-mails. Terrible support. Avoid at all costs !!"
2,How quaint!,"Is this what it was like twenty years ago? The ""show"" is quaint, rather silly, and definitely not sexy as the girls--whoops, women--gyrate and dance and, yes, manage to take off some clothes in the process. The MC is invasive, corny, and the way I remember things twenty or thirty years ago. Value: nostalgia, period."
5,A Semifinalist for the RFK Book Award,"This is a powerful book, much more than a story of one city. It's an AMERICAN story. Highly recommended for anyone interested in race relations in the USA."
4,useful but not comprehensive,"I found this balanced and very good at describing the political environment in Macon for most of the 20th century. I was looking for something that also would have given a better idea of the every day lives of Black and White in Macon at various periods, which was not really addressed. But, for a summary of the political battles over segregation, Jim Crow laws, how race was used for political purposes in multiple decades, civil rights agitation, and progress on desegregation it is a good read and scholarly summary."
2,heavily biased,"The author of this book misses a great opportunity. I bought this book with enthusiasm only to throw it in the garbage. It paints a picture that focuses on certain people and periods heavily, while completely leaving out large parts of Macon's history and the people involved in it. This book is meant to make certain individuals look good. It was written with a strong agenda and will lead the reader astray. It is unfortunate that the backers of the book and the author chose to proceed with their biased desires instead of thinking and being objective and balanced. History doesn't need this kind of inaccurate representation, especially from someone who calls himself a historian."
2,"Good finish, but didn't fit together properly","This chair looked promising when I opened it - the finish seemed durable and it all felt very solid. However, as I progressed through the assembly I realized that it wasn't fitting together well at all, to the point that some of the final pieces were an inch or more away from fitting. I wound up taking it back apart and returning it."
4,Light and Wholesome Romance Novel,"Bree Trehearn is running for her life. She runs right into Cody North's life. As in all romance novels - they fight, they misunderstand, they keep secrets and of course they fall in love despite themselves. What is different about this novel is that the author doesn't find it necessary to pepper the story with sex scenes and I, for one, appreciate this.Ms. Bulock has created a wonderfully sweet, yet suspenseful novel. Her characters are well developed and they actually seem real and believable. She kept me interested throughout.A very good book. I recommend it without a doubt!"
4,A Fast Paced Romance,"Seems lately with my reading, I've found that books move so much faster than older books. This book is no exception, but, timing isn't everything. I felt this Bree and Cody romance came out of THIN AIR! I didn't even know they had strong feelings for each other.Bree is running from a man she stole information from. His illegal information on his computer was found and she stole it. She finds herself with Cody, the manager of Island Breeze, a vacation spot. I felt the relationship was a little fast, but it was over all well written."
2,Lagrimas of boredom,"Boring, derivative and very mildly amusing. Almodovar did it all before-and much better 20 years ago! I couldn't ever watch it for more than 30 minutes. The only positive comment I have is that the movie shows a more polished and upscale side of Mexico and not the usual slums and sordid lives that seems to be so typical in Mexican movies, at least those imported in the USA."
5,Love the Tic Talk,I love this phone! I was hesitant to purchase my child a cell phone. When I found the Tic Talk I was thrilled. I love being able to conrol incoming and outgoing calls. I also am able to set it to only receive calls at certain times like after school and before bedtime. Parents can feel very safe buying this phone for their children. There are also some really great fun and educational games that my child loves to play on it. Overall it is a great product and I am happy with it.
2,Tic Talk - Seems fun but difficult to use,"I bought this phone for my then-seven year old son. I had so much trouble getting it registered online. Although I followed the instructions in the booklet, it was not helpful. I called the customer service number and they were not helpful. My son used the phone once or twice once I got it up and running, but then there was an ""upgrade"" that I had to get for the phone. It didn't cost anything but I must have completed the upgrade at least six times and the phone would NOT sync with the upgrade. I called customer service at least five times and they, again, were no help. I finally decided to sell the stupid thing and be done with it. It's more trouble than it's worth to me."
4,Controversial and cliffhanger.,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
5,Before its time,"This show is one of the greatest shows on tv -viewers never saw. Over Thanksgiving break my family devored it, and we were saddened to realize there was no 2nd season. Its a must watch - hopefully someday we will get to see a second King."
5,Kings - Too good for Television,"Series is stylish, bold, and artful. Too good for television, especially for NBC, who failed to promote such an engrossing series. After watching the first two episodes, it's impossible not to feel amazed by the fact that a drama this excellent and original could make it on network TV. The cast is amazing, the characters are appealing, has great cinematography, the acting performances are excellent, and the writing is sharp and poetic - almost unprecedented for a television show. Ian McShane is RIVETING as King Silas! I fell in love with this show because it is so original and daring and lovely - doesn't look and feel like anything else on television. It has the whole package! Shame to see it go, but hopefully a smarter network will pick it up. I've already pre-ordered it!"
4,Well-done!,"I am shocked that this is network television. I would never have guessed had someone not mentioned it in another review. I am not surprised that it only got one season. There are alot of wonderful things about this show. Crafted well, acting is first rate, and while some of the plot lines are predictable, they are written and performed well. It's a great premise and the possibilities are sadly left unfulfilled. Would that it had a chance to grow into what it might well have been - one of the best things on network tv."
4,Great show... but where's the Blu-ray?,"Kings is easily one of the best, smartest dramas on TV. But like other before it (Firefly), it just never found a big enough audience. Shame.The only reason I deducted one star is that there is no High Def Blu-ray Disc version. The show had some great cinematography, and deserves to be shown in HD."
1,Agree with the other 1-star review,I'm getting tired of all the network BS. Watch HBO. Nothing on the networks is worth it!
4,Good writing,"This series is well-written and has an all too rare balance of drama, action, intelligent dialogue, and an entertaining plotline.I heard that the first season will also be the last. I hope that's not true, but if so, it just goes to show that most people prefer more dumbed-down entertainment."
5,great,"kings rules. great purchase. Im bummed that this is the only season in existence. I wish there were many many more episodes. Dont get too attatched, as you will never get to finish the story. But when the last episode ends just pick uo the bible, you can read all about King David and find out what happens!"
4,"Nothing is perfect, but Kings is incredibly close!","From the very first episode, it was clear that Kings was doomed. There was plot, there was actual depth, and there was a lot of thought put into this series. It's sad that NBC put an end to the series without the natural conclusion that was there, but this was their choice.The DVD is just as good as the series, and even at prices more expensive than a full season (this is only the 12 episodes shown), it delivers. Each disc contains deleted scenes, special features, and goodies for the viewer, unlike most from show dvd's anymore that cram it all into one. The quality is (of course) excellent, and I've already made it through the dvd set twice.If you didn't get a chance to watch it when it aired, find a way to watch just one episode through unbox, THEN from there decide whether or not you want to spend Amazon's price for this. It is a bit high, but if you like QUALITY television, you will love this show."
3,Just okay,If you are really bored and a big Ian Mcshane fan then you will enjoy some of this series. He definitely carried the series. But for the most part..it was a big yawn.
3,Unfinished,"I enjoyed this but with the proviso that this was a failed series. Season 1 was all there was so it was never developed;still, it was well done and interesting."
3,Good series,"Political and royal intrigue with Machiavellian maneuvering, tragic love story like a seed cast in unfertile soil stuggling to survive, magical belief-inspired storytelling. Ian McShane is riveting in the role of King Silas, with dialog both artful and poetic. I first discovered this series on HD television starting with episode 2 and really enjoyed it. From episodes 2 till the end, I give 4 stars. The first episode, which I had missed on television, I only give 2 stars. I don't seem to see the beautiful colours that I saw on television reflected on the DVD."
1,Don't waste yout time,"I only made it half-way through this turkey. No wonder the show was canceled. I now know my new calling. It's to review pilots of shows like this for the studios and slap the heck out of whomever dreamt up drivel like this! Just kidding of course, but barely! ""Kings is deleted! Long live the delete button!"""
1,"great show, too bad it never got a chance",i give it a 1 because much goes unanswered with the cancellation and i don't believe it rewarding the studio for their shortsightedness.
5,"And the Series Starts with a Bang, Butterflies and a Crown","Finally it appears as if network television is finally getting that audiences are sick of hospital shows, buddy cop and really bad sit coms.Kings is an amazing watch, well-crafted, and acted with an incredibly believable story line.Hats off to Michael Green, the writers (especially to you guys), producers, and entire crew for crafting a show that is intriging to watch and imaginative!"
5,Battling Butler,"This movies was part of a new series we're presenting, using live music to accompany silent movies. It was a great choice and the audience loved it!"
2,Way too expensive,"The gum is natural, free of artificial flavors and coloring. However, its made of sugar alcohol and latex for god's sake, so the price they are charging is not acceptable. I think I will be giving up gum for good unless they lower the price or a competition makes another natural chewing gum."
2,not very long lasting,"I'm a little disappointed in this gum. The pieces (indivudal ""chiclets"" in a blister pack) are tiny (expect to pop at least 2) and the flavour blows out pretty quickly. I have been chewing Trident ""mini sticks"" for some time. They too use Xylitol as the sweetener but retain their consistency and flavour for much longer than Xlichew.Even the initial flavour of Xylichew is pretty weak compared to Trident.I likely won't be buying Xylichew again."
5,Holds heat like crazy,"I received one of these in an Aveda gift box years ago, but without a name-brand attached. This is exactly the same one but with a cover. The neck pillow holds hard cherry pits so it's not the kind of thing you'd want to put behind your back. It's for your shoulders and neck. It has weight to it and holds heat (and cold) like crazy. Better than any other product I have tried. I have fibromyalgia and it relaxes my shoulders. I highly recommend it. I have given them as gifts and everyone has loved them. Be aware that it is NOT aromatherapy (per se) unless you like the smell of baked bread when heated. I do. I got sick of the herbal-type fragrances in many other products. After a while the fragrance reminds one of health and wholeness, and it is so welcomed!"
5,I Love It Too!,"Yes, this is a super product that retains warmth, looks great, and has a nice weight to it.High recommend!"
4,Does what its supposed to,"The title says it all. This cherry pit heating pack works exactly as it says it will. My only complaint, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five, was the smell. Which I can't get used to. Just makes me think of a hot mouthful of cherry pits that haven't been spit out yet"
3,"Not bad...but not great, either","Much of the beginning chapters in SWT are simply API listings - WORTHLESS! I've got those online...don't need them in a book, especially since they are not as complete as the JavaDocs. Otherwise, not bad. I'm looking for better..."
5,An Excellent SWT Book,"This is an excellent book for both the beginner and the professional developer. If you need to write an application and are planning to use SWT but are not a guru, you will want to get this book. It does a great job of explaining SWT, what it is, why it is that way, and how to use it.Each section of the book provides a topic for discussion, a code example and a complete description of all the classes and methods used. I particularly appreciated the code examples and the tips for real world implementation. The code is clean, complete, and easy to understand.I found this book easy to read. The author interspersed just the right amount of theory, history, and commentary to break up the details and keep me interested. It is obvious that he has a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The surprising part is how adept he is at communicating this knowledge to the reader."
2,"Good on Visual Design, Virtually Zilch on Event Handling","If your main question is how to place widgets on your screens, then this book is excellent. But if, however, you would like those widgets to actually trigger events, then this book is a damned disappointment. They have a general chapter on events but for widget after widget, their examples show you how to place the widget on the page but not how to get its events. You can write code to trigger events but try to do something useful with those events and you will be greatly disappointed.Also, if you were hoping for some guidance or examples on how to use the 'asyncExec()' or 'syncExec()' methods, you will be disappointed. There is nothing. So, if you need anything beyond the basics, don't waste your money."
1,Useless Book,"The authors do not seem to understand what MVC is about. A useless book, I regret to have bought it."
3,"Pretty good, not the best","We ordered this book along with A Comprehensive Indian Wedding Planner by Gill. I found the other book to be much more comprehensive and useful. This book is fine, but rather short, just giving an overview of the Indian wedding ceremony and traditions. The other book has more pictures and more detail."
3,the basics,"i think this is a good starting point for a planning a hindu wedding when you really have no idea what a hindu wedding entails. but i found the overall tone a little simplistic and not really written with modern society in mind. nevertheless, there are some good definitions and descriptions - just make sure you research the different rituals more."
4,"Great, Does What It Should","I have a Minolta X-570 35mm Camera and it works great, does exactly what it should (I'll see the images soon, yet to have them developed...) but I have just one concern. I wish there was a place for my pointer and middle fingers to hold on to while my thumb presses down the button that isn't the screw that locks the button down. I'm always afraid I might slip and not tighten the screw correctly while I fumble around with situating my fingers.It seems very durable, a solid quality product. Worth the price, but get that feature added!"
3,unable to use,I have a new cannon t4i and this camera does not take a cable release. this camera uses electrical release instead of mechical. I ordered this before the camera arrived. don't think any modern cameras use mechanical release's anymore. I am sure it works on some older camera's.
2,Not quite what I'd hoped for...,"I bought this tape as a complement to ""Hard Questions, Straight Answers: For Boys"" but it just did not have the same quality of presentation. The title ""For Boys"" has a strong biblical foundation dealing with issues of morality and character, and this did not. While the content was informative, it fell significantly short of what I wanted and expected."
4,Love It!,"It's water resistant, but if you're going for a long walk in the rain the inside will become damp. Otherwise, for quick outside jaunts, it's fine. I don't use the leg straps, so it's easy on & off. I think my dog even likes it. We have purple and receive lots of compliments."
2,"Long Journey, Small Payoff","I actually searched far and wide for a Swingers CD due to the fact they are well represented on the truly excellent ""Starstruck"" soundtrack (not available on CD). Not easy - I ended up ordering this from New Zealand (far far from me) via eBay. As it turns out, the one song the soundtrack and this CD have in common ""One Good Reason"" (titled ""Gimme Love"" on soundtrack) is also, by far, the best. ""Flak"" and the title song are OK, but the rest weren't even worth ripping, IMHO."
2,Too much filler,"A real mixture here. My favourites are True or False, More, Counting the Beat and Ayatollah. Otherwise, there is too much filler. Forget Practical Joker, Five O'Clock Shadow, Funny Feeling, Hit the Beach and Distortion. These songs are rock bottom. Unless you are a big fan of Split Enz and/or Phil Judd, this album is a bit risky."
5,A Compendium of Movie Classics,"Mr. Cozad's ability to write engaging prose regarding the facisnating history of movies reminds one of Will Durant's ""History of Civilization."" His depth of knowledge is unmatched...it is a must read for any affcianado of the cinema.It is a New York Times bestseller in the making!"
3,Disapointed,I was under the impression tha the soap I purchased was an English product from England but what I received was manufactured in India with synthetic ingredients.The British product is far superior with natural ingredients.I feel I over paid for this product which is readily available in our local Indian grocer at a lower price.
2,too obvious,this book contains nothing new.just stuff you can find surfing in the internet for a few hours.not worth reading it-the things are too obvious.
3,"Interesting read, but borrow it if you can...","My wife purchased this on my account. Here is her review:I purchased this book from recommendations elsewhere (not on Amazon). It is a worthy read and I gained insight from reading it. (Other reviews already go over the content.) However, I would have preferred to have borrowed it from a friend or acquaintance versus buying it. I did try finding it in three library systems locally, to no avail. It just isn't something I will read multiple times. It is a book that you can read once and learn from versus a reference book or something so complex multiple readings benefit you. I'll lend it out to a few friends before passing it along to our local library."
2,how to describe?,"Fresh, clean, herbal, very, very soft, so soft it's basically undetectable. Smells a great deal like my Italian kitchen spices watered down and sprayed on. Fine for work, no one will even know you are wearing it. Keep in mind I am a lover of bold fragrances in small doses, but one could take a bath in this and come away with nothing. To me, that's poor value."
3,A little past its prime!!,This perfume is my favorite it has a scent that is wonderful and sexy and fresh. Unfortunately the perfume was past its prime and smelled a bit stale instead of that wonderful fresh scent. Over priced for such a product problem. This was the fault of the supplier not the perfume. I kept the product becuase I could not get it anywhere else and I was completely out.
1,"Works at first, but mechanism doesn't hold up..","It worked well for a short while but the mechanism gave up its' ghost rather quickly and would no longer work (and I'm not a big person). Can't recommend this,,, broke on me today. Will be looking for another product option."
1,Be careful where you put the thermometer,"Today it was 35 degrees and thermometer read 80 degrees. It was in direct sun light on the window, but give me a break - 40 degrees diference. I had another window thermometer in the same place for 5 years and it read the temperature accurately. I purchased that thermometer at Brookstone - I going back to look for it."
1,Should be ZERO stars,"Wish I could give Zero stars. It's January 14th, I'm wearing gloves and a jacket, but the thermometer says it is 92 degrees!do NOT waste your money."
2,May Actually Prevent Alzheimers,"This thermometer attaches easily to a glass surface and stays put. But if you're looking for the acutal temperature outside, be prepared to do some mental math because this gadget is always off by between 5 and 7 degrees. You just automatically adjust the actual reading downward in your mind: thermometer says 95 degrees? Actual temp is then b/t 88 and 90 (according to my mercury thermometer and another wireless model that agree with each other). Not so bad once you fall into the habit. I have a radio in my car that's always 4 minutes slow (I don't know how to adjust it) so it helps with doing the mental gymnastics required for the thermometer every day, and the latest scientific studies say that brain exercise of this sort can help prevent Alzheimers Disease. I bought two of these thermometers at the same time and both have the same error quotient. I even brought one inside to test it and got the same results. Still, it looks nice and clings as advertised."
2,junk!!,"Bought this at a local hardware store, It sticks to the window fine but the temp is way off. Don't waste your money!!"
1,Laughably inaccurate,"Wanted to be able to tell at a glance what outdoor temp was. Apparently it's always 50, unless the sun is shining on the window this thermometer is on, in which case it is 65. Not sure if ours is defective, but it's on average about 10 degrees off, and as much as 25 degrees off on sunny days. Don't waste your money."
1,"Terrible thermometer, wish I had returned the two I bought!","I bought two of these silly things! It is 70 degrees out today and the one in my kitchen says 120+ I need to throw them away but havn't got around to it. Do not buy this product, you will be throwing your money away! I wouldn't give it one star, but didn't have the option!"
3,Doesn't go up high enough,"Maybe it's where I placed it (outside the kitchen window on a shaded porch) but the temperature never read above 88 on a day that was 95. Still seems to be accurate at moderate temperatures, though."
1,72 for weeks,The temperature has read 72 for about 2 months. I live in New England - the temperature fluctuates every five minutes! I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Works Poorly,"I have calibrated the thing several times, and it still doesn't work. It is always off, sometimes by 20 degrees. Even in no direct sunlight. I'd return it if it wasn't a waste of my time."
2,Pretty is as Pretty DOES.,"I really like the look of this on our North window....and I can see the numbers easily without squinting or having to walk up close. HOWEVER...we've tested this cute thing and it DOES NOT READY ACCURATE TEMP. Ours is off every time by exactly 8 degrees.....no matter where we put it. (the other three thermometers placed beside it were all exactly the same reading).I just give it a glance and add 8 in my mind, so it's somewhat usable....but I still always double check (have to fetch my glasses) the old thermometer from L.L. Beans which has always been accurate."
3,Easy to use,Item is easy to use - not so sure about the accurancy though but it does cling to the window without having to install brackets. Peel and paste basically and removes just as easy.
5,"Good price, good visibility","It's been stuck to my window for two weeks, seems to work well. Pretty basic, not sure you can say much about it. I only expect these things to be accurate within about 5 degrees/ I don't really care whether it's 31 degrees or 36 degrees outside, but I definitely want to know if it's 15 degrees, and this seems to do that pretty well."
4,Thermometer,"I use this in a greenhouse, and I'm not attaching it to a window. I wanted a sturdy, easy-to-read thermometer. This does the trick. Since I don't have it attached to glass, I can't honestly speak to that feature. However, the mechanism protrudes a bit and was heavier than I expected. In extremely cold weather with a heavy wind (my climate), I'm not sure it would survive outside."
3,Does the job,Sticks to the window fine the Temp is a little off but you get what you pay for. No complaints
2,Inaccurate outdoor temperature reading,"Looks nice, easy to mount. Overpriced and outside reading is affected by heat inside the house radiating through the window pane."
1,Laughable,"PLEASE, save your money. I've had this thermometer for over a month and the closest it has come to being accurate is being about 20 degrees off (largest difference has been over 45 degrees). It seems to be strongly influenced by the glass temperature so if you have an older house with old windows it's completely worthless. I couldn't recommend this thermometer for outdoor use or any use where accuracy is even mildly important."
3,incorrect temp,"just received the thermometer and installed it - local weather puts the temp at ~ 77 F while this thermometer reads 110 and rising. I'm going to give it a day and then probably try to return it. (original rating 1 star)update 1: it's now been a couple of hours and the temp on the dial sorta-kinda matches the actual outside temp, and I've raised my review to 3 stars, tentatively...I'm going to monitor the next few hours versus my other gauges to see if the initial +30 degrees error was an anomaly.update 2: overnight, the thermometer seems to have tracked the actual temp pretty well - I'm going to check it later in full sun and see if it repeats that nonsense from yesterday - if not, I'll upgrade the rating and be done with this."
3,Outdoor thermometer,It works very well and the installation is a snap. It is larger than I anticipated but I'll live with it
2,Meh... not terribly accurate,"Unit is sturdy, looks excellent, sticks nicely (even in the wind), and is very easy to make out the temp. I've got 1 on each side of the house so I can see whats going on in the shade and the sunlight. Units appear to be accurate and are within a few degrees of each other (shady side vs sunny side...). I'd say w/in 2-3*.EDIT: So I'm going to have to edit this review. The temperatures are way off. For instance, when the thermometer reads 30-35*, I can expect it to be much colder outside. When the thermometer reads 20*f, Its actually around 5*f. 20*f isn't *that* cold.. but when THIS thermometer reads 20*f, I walk outside and my breath is taken away, and grass and snow are crunchy that its so cold outside... read: 5*f actual.Over 40* it seems accurate, but its hard to say..."
2,Not what I expected,This thermostat is not what I had hoped for in the sense that it does not keep accurate temperature. I'm not very pleased with this product. Wish I didn't waste the $$ on it.
1,A Waste of Money,This thing sticks to the window just fine but what's the point when the temperature on it is never right. It's on a north-facing window so the sun does not shine directly on it. It's 95 outside and it's reading 110. This horrible heat is bad enough without having your thermometer read so much higher than it actually is. I'm taking it down. I don't even want to look at it. It was a waste of my money.
1,Wildly Inaccurate and Useless,This thermometer's readings are wildly inaccurate--generally 12 to 15 degrees warmer than what is reported on other thermometers and on the weather report. It is useless.
4,easy to install and easy to use,what I didn't realize is it will be affected by the temp inside the house (I mounted in a glass door from the house to the balcony). the temp is a few degrees higher than what it said on the website.
1,Huge disappointment,"I've had this stapler for less than a year. Use it very little; I believe it is still on its first load of staples. Just picked it up to staple two pages together, squeezed, and the metal base snapped in two! Right clear in two, just in front of where the curving base side straightens out. What an unbelievable piece of crap! I had expressly chosen it over cheaper models, because it appeared more solidly built. I may be reasonably strong, but I certainly didn't squeeze it any harder than needed to insert a staple.(I hope this rating comes thru with zero stars, as that is what I intended.)"
2,Doesn't last,This stapler worked for the intended use. It didn't jam. But it did break after owning it for less than a year. The top of the stapler broke apart from the springy mechanism inside. It can't be fixed and is beyond the return window.
3,my 2nd little steamer,"I recieved my first steamer as a gift 2 years ago and loved it since the first time I used it. I used it quite frequently for almost 2 years and then it just died on me! I was really frustrated with it and dissappointed that it only lasted less than 2 years, but I eventually ordered another on-line, so I am hoping that this one will last longer."
1,My Little Broken Steamer,"I bought this steamer brand new and still in its plastic wrapping. When I filled up the steamer to test it out, all of the water drained out in these 2 little holes at the bottom. I didn't even get a chance to use my steamer because I coudln't even fill it up with water! I've never been so disappointed with a new product."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"I bought this thing and it was so bad that the guy who sold it to me off Amazon gave me a refund and told me to keep it! I then gave it to my sister who wanted it, and she gave it back to me. I don't even think a Goodwill will take it at this point. It's completely impractical and useless and here's why: you cannot tip this thing lest you spill its boiling contents and give yourself 4th degree burns. Also, when using the steamer, you have to precariously hang up clothes on your door jamb and hope they don't fall off while you are ""steaming"" them. And then, even if you can get the clothes to stay in one spot, the steamer doesn't even remove wrinkles! It's totally weak."
2,Better books out there....,"I borrowed this from the library, and was disappointed in a number of things:First, good luck getting one of the white postal mail templates they talk about and picture near the the beginning of the book. The post office I went to wouldn't give you anything unless you were planning to do bulk mail, where everything has to be a certain size and fit in with certain guidelines (the uniformity and sheer numbers is why bulk mail is cheaper). The book states that your post office will give you one for free just for the asking--NOT!Second, if you are going to demonstrate folds, use solid-colored paper for clarity's sake. The paper they used was so busy that it was difficult to see fold lines.Third, I had seen just about all of their projects in other books before, so if you have done any reading on this subject at all you are likely to be disappointed.Bottom line: wait 'til this one is remaindered."
5,Never send a boring letter again!,"You will be itching to send someone a letter after you read about and practice the paper crafting techniques presented in this book. And as a bonus, not only can you use them to create unique correspondence, but you can also use them in your scrapbooks, art journals, or altered books! Basic collage, painting techniques, paper cutting, and stamping ideas are presented with step-by-step instructions that are illustrated with detailed photographs so that you will make no mistake while putting these works of art together.So get out that list of people you've been meaning to write to and just haven't gotten around to doing. You'll have a blast and they will appreciate the beautiful mail you send them."
5,It's Creative and Sometimes It's Art!,"These folks have actually taught workshops to real people. You can tell. The directions and photos are accurate and easy to follow. The projects are the simple, open-ended kind that should get the creative juices flowing. No one should ever again send plain-Jane boring mail. Reuse, recycle, collage! Thank you, Creative Zone!"
4,Great book for beginners!,This is a very good introductory book. The authors go into explaining the details of the various derivatives in depth and give concrete numerical examples how they can be priced. However only elementary pricing techniques are considered -- a practitioner will not find much use of them.I am giving the book 4 stars because the book contains many typos and errors which can be quite confusing to a beginner (e.g. mislabeled graphs). With four authors on the cover they could have done a better job at this.
2,My copy is poorly published,"For the first 150 pages, I thought this was a useful product. Not too deeply mathematical and clearly written. I would have given it 4 stars.Then I noticed that it jumped from page 150 to 189. And repeated some pages after 180 again later in the book. Useless."
2,Interesting,"Why don't people who have great experiences as novices ever write books?? Am I the only person who ever spent a few years in a convent that was inhabited by intelligent, saintly folks with fine intentions, no favoritism. . . yet profoundly human individuals? Is it that rare? Reading these sorts of books, I can only be profoundly grateful for the experience that I had, and that I never ever met these sorts of people who appear in these books!"
3,Not as good as expected,"Well, I only know a bit of Fawcett' lovely work. This book is quite interesting but pretty low on technical/how-to info (his main point seems to be to draw the subject the same size as you see it). Can't really recommend it..."
5,Excellent value for the price,I needed a center channel speaker to compliment the in-wall speakers in our living room. I had tried a Bose center channel speaker at first but it's tinny sound drove me to distraction. We use the living room for general purpose viewing and listening to music so I didn't need an expensive speaker. But the larger speaker cones give a rich full sound that matches the higher quality in-walls. The design is a bit large but we have a CRT HD set so it is proportionate to the speaker.All in all we are extremely happy with the quality and style of this speaker. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
5,Amazing,"Exactly what I was looking for! Crisp, clear voice & sound effects! No cons as far as I know of yet, and I recommend this center channel to anyone building a jbl home theater!"
3,Adequate Center Channel,"This center channel speaker is in a plastic case!!! That is my biggest complaint and it is pretty large. I bought this speaker because it was designed to match the floorstanding JBL speakers I bought. It does an adequate job on most dialog although on occasion it can disappear, but I may be able to rectify it with some work on the settings on my receiver. In summary it is an adequate center channel but I was much more impressed with the other JBL speakers in the Venue series."
3,Mediocre Speaker,"This is an adequate center channel speaker. It will definitely be better than the center channel speakers that come with most home theater packages, but it is one definite step down from audiophile quality.I bought it to expand my JBL ""Studio Series"" main speakers into a 5.1 channel system. It was immediately obvious that this ""Venue"" series speaker is just not a good match. It sounds a bit ""boxey"" and unnatural. Probably because it is only a 2-way speaker and actually is housed in a thin plastic housing. When you consider the price, it is a reasonable value, but I am now going to step up to the next level of JBL Center channel that will include a midrange speaker. Unfortunately, that level also costs twice as much. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" Even though it is a reasonable value, it did not satisfy my desire for a higher quality speaker."
2,Poor Sound quality and Big,This speaker had poor sound quality and was very large. I have the bose Acoustimass in another room and they blow this speaker away and for a fraction of the size.
4,Comfortable fit,Overall this was a great product for the price. I am satisfied with this purchase I would recommend to others
5,"Good fit, disposable","I use to use those swine flu n95 mask to do wall refinishing work like sanding compound from sheet rock joints.Now this is the mother of all mask, you can get so much better breathing, deep inhales with no restriction. You don't end up fogging your glasses and you can actually breath fine.Not sure if this is overkill but quality is very good for a disposable mask, I think I can get months of use from it."
1,Not as good as it looks,"Let's begin. I ordered two of these. I got two of them. One had the motor burnt out by the time I got it, the other did not accept the magazine. Afetr arguing with the seller, the only responses I got were instructions on how to load and fire the gun, and to make sure i had the batteries incorrectly. I opened them up to find that the gun that didn't accept the magazine had internal parts cracked. A vain attempt to make one working gun from two worthless ones ended in failure. I'm out thirty bucks,Such a shame..."
2,It was good for about 5 minutes,"First off I would like to say I love the way this gun looks. It's big but it fits nicely in your hands. Sadly that is about the only good thing about it.The gun jams, is hard to load, frustrating to put in batteries, but all of these things I was willing to overlook until IT happened.The gun has a major battery problem. On 4 fully charged AAA batteries the gun was able to shoot about 4 clips worth. So I used a battery tester to see if it was just the batteries messing up... it wasn't. The batteries showed a full charge. I went through this process about 3-4 times with the same result.My advise. DO NOT GET THIS GUN!!!!! if for any reason you had to return this gun (which I did) it ends up costing you $10 more than you paid before. (If you spent $20 with shipping to you and then returned it, you would still be $20 in the hole)What a shame..."
5,A good book,A fun and interesting book filled with action and adventure. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that will strech their imagination.
3,Action packed,"Whenever you marry, the person always turns out to be a little different than who you expected. This is certainly true for Maddy when her new husband suddenly disappears and a handsome stranger comes asking questions about him. Nick CiaCia, pronounced Cha cha, is a man with a mission, to find the serial killer who took his father's life. Maddy's missing husband may well be that man. In an unlikely alliance, a the killer's wife becomes Nick's closest ally in the pursuit of the truth. Before too long, that closeness gets very close.*** Pages turn quickly in this action packed suspenseful thriller. The lure of forbidden love combined with the horrified fascination of murder makes for a tension filled read. ***"
3,"Aimed at a teenage and pre-teen audience. This is a novel, not a graphic novel.","This was a good novel, I kind of liked it. Good plot, some twists, pretty good character development.This might be a bad choice for a reader over age 18, since much of the character development consists of squabbles over who sits where in the van sorts of things. (I'm in my 50s, so I found the book tedious in many places.)This is a novel, not a graphic novel. If you're looking for art, the only art to speak of is on the cover. The chapter heading art is too basic to count.But, man, the cover art is fantastic! Someone named Julie Bell did it, and I think they should get her working on graphic novels. Her version of Katlin is the best!"
4,Pretty Impressive,"To be honest, I had never heard of Gen 13 before this book when my friend gave it to me for christmas. I did, however, read Golden's Empire Trilogy, so I expecting something good. As it turns out I was right. Netherwar tends to focus on something you never read about in comic-book novels: the hero's daily lives. I mean, we get to see what the hero's do when not doing their usual thing. Of couse, it hardly gets boring though, what with tons of action and adventure. From fighting demons to keepers and going from one bad situation to another, this novel has really gotten me interested in Gen 13. Then why not five stars you ask? Well, the plot is not as complex as I would have wanted it to be. But it is a good read nonetheless."
4,Entertaining concept with familier characters,"Like a Buffy the Vampire slayer episode or some of Christopher Goldens' Buffy novels, Gen13 Netherwar relies heavily on snappy dialogue as the bad guys are fended off by various superpowered (and in the case of Fairchild, superendowed) teens. The writer's have done a good job of writing about this group, and I thought the supernatural aspect was very well done. I thought it was interesting to read about these characters in the past, kind of, since it takes place a while ago in that universe's timeline, while the group was still based in Lajolla. I would like to see more real books about these guys, as long as they are written well."
1,A very silly story,"Gen13, whch is now published by Wilstorm, an imprint of DC Comics, is a typical uninteresting comic created in the 90's. It is not so much about supreheroes but is more about these teenagers who spend more time goofing around then using their powers in a constructive manner. This novel pretty much stays true to the comic, it has no story and the characters are very one dimensional and have no personality at all. If they do anymore novels on Gen 13 or any of the other Wildstorm heroes, it will be a waste of the paper it is printed on."
5,If your into taz like I am you'll love it!!!!!!!,This item is very wel constructed. I was also pleased of the way the straps were velcro and went all the way up the strap where as some would just stop a quater or half way up.Taz Attitude II CD/DVD Visor Organizer.
5,Best Asperger's Book EVER,"I am a mother. I'ver been dealing with this for may years. This is the ONLY book that has ever given me any real insight into my son's head. I loved it! I laughed, I cried, all through the emotion spectrum. I really wish that there were more book written by people who actually have Asperger's and not a degree. More than worth the investment."
5,A good start,This was a first step in learning more about Asperger's. It is cogent and sympathetic to those afflicted. The point of view helped me as a teacher of someone with this diagnosis to relax and let the student proceed.
5,Not a disease!,"Under ""Book Info"" in the Amazon reviews, you mistakenly call AS a disease. In point of fact, it is a disorder. In reality, it is in many ways a blessing, but certainly makes life more challenging. I have a 17 year old son with Asperger Syndrome, so I can attest to that. I have not yet read this book, but it sounds like a gem and it is on my wish list. I am giving it 5 stars with every hope that it is worthy of the rating, especially with Tony Atwood's name on it."
3,An ok book,"I must admit that I have not finished reading it yet due to the fact that I HATE the title. For a parent of a child with AS, the last words one wants to refer their child to is a freak and a geek."
5,I only wish I had read this book earlier!,"This is an absolutely WONDERFUL book! It treats Asperger's Syndrome as a different way of thinking (which CAN lead to great things!), rather than as a disease. The writer has the most wonderful, positive outlook, and gives hope to people with Asperger's and autism, as well as those who love them.My son is only 8 yrs. old, and he is high-functioning autistic. This is not exactly the same as Asperger's, so I didn't know if this book would be all that helpful. But it definitely is! I now have a much greater understanding of my son and his behaviors, and I am likely to be much more patient. I can also relax and enjoy him, instead of worrying so much about his future. This is a great gift, and all the more remarkable because the writer is only 13 years old! Bravo, Luke Jackson! You're my hero!"
5,"Freaks, Geeks & Asperger Syndrome","This is a MUST READ for everyone who has a child or adult in the Autistic Spectrom!! Gives first hand information into the reasons why they react like they do to different situations daily in life!! Thanks to the author, Luke Jackson, we can now have a better insite into how to help them have less stress and help ourselves in the process!! Verleen (our 17 yr old grandson, Zachary has AS)"
5,Super book for families of an Asperger's Syndrome kid,"A valuable book for not only families of Asperger Syndrome kids, but the kids themselves, as long as they are of teenager age. Written with clarity, insight, and a sense of humor, this book helped my child and I deal with his recent diagnosis and the meaning of all this for his future. I'll be very interested to see what else Luke Jackson publishes as he advances in years and experience."
5,Great for gaining insight!,"Luke Jackson give unique insight into living with Asperger Syndrome. This personal account of what it is like to be autistic makes for interesting reading. I don't tend to recommend personal accounts of autism to be a 'resource' guide for professionals working with autistic children, but if you are looking to gain a little perspective on Asperger's syndrome you are in the right place"
4,"Real, useful, insightful","My Aspie son is 12. We are reading this together. The authentic voice of Luke is a great asset. He helps the reader understand his experience and perspective without the filters of another writer. The advice is practical without sounding ""therapeutic"". The main reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the British syntax is sometimes odd to an American ear and requires explanation."
3,Don't really know about this book yet.,"Bought for my son who was diagnosed with mild Asperger's spectrum disorder at age 10. Thought it would help him understand more about it. He was interested in reading it until it arrived. Can't really review properly, thus the 3 stars."
5,Living with a young adult with Asbergers,I bought the book for my best friend whose daughter has Asbergers. She hopes it. Will help both her and her daughter to read this book.
4,Freaks Geeks and Aspbergers Syndrom,I found this to be of help for my 11 year old grqandson. Parts were repectivtive but most was put into a fomat that he eenjoyed reading . He was happy to realize that there were others in a family like him in so many ways.
1,Biggest Piece of Crap Ever,We have had these phones for years and they sucked since we bought them. Answering machine works sporadically batteries dead or dying all the time. Run like hell from this one!
1,Stolen from a true teacher,"This work was stolen from ""Billy"" Eduard Albert Meier. Billy wrote this first draft in 1948.(Spiritual Training through Attentivness). It was read and copied and sent out to other monks. Because knowone had never heard of Billy, they copied the work as thier own. Two more drafts were writen by Billy Meier and they too were copied. Learn the truth about Billy at [...] or read the details at [...]"
4,A must have book on the Chesapeake Bay,"Arguably the most comprehensive, meticulous, and factual book ever written on the vast expanse of the Chesapeake Bay for fishermen. A must have, must read guidebook, no matter what level of fishing expertise."
4,A Good Introduction to Charting With Telechart 2000,"This is a good introduction to technical analysis of stocks. It is best used in conjunction with the Telechart 2000 software and data.If you subscribe to Telechart or are thinking of using their software, this is a great place to start since the author gives you the formulas of TC2000 to do technical analysis."
2,Nothing new to offer...available freely on website.,There are more than 140 popular chart pattern. I returned this book becuase whatever he mentioned is freely available on websites. I do not want to publicize any website. But do a search in Google for 'Stock Chart or Technical indicator' and you will get better explanation and tips than what is in this book.I can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy. The GOLDEN RULE... If the system works then may be start a hedge fund.. If it does not then write a book...hold seminar...
3,Useful as a starting point,"Like always, Lonely Planet has problems updating their travel guides, but generally it is an easy to navigate source of information. I noticed that the list of hotels in the Lonely Planet guidebooks has become very limited and we often had to search for accommodation after arrival as the listed hotels tend to be booked out first. The ""Getting There and Away"" sections could be more specific as we never new where we had to go for a specific bus station. It would also be helpful to write these places out in Arabic, as many taxi drivers cannot read English letters."
1,I am an idjet!!,"The movie is an OK ""B"" sci fi movie. What I did NOT catch is that this is ""Full Screen"" version. Yucch!!! I wish the product description was a little more up front on this."
2,Not much content!,"I was surprised to see a lack of good physics blogs for the Kindle. I figured there would be at least a few blogs that had good scientific content. The only one that even came close was this blog, ""Uncertain Principles.""There were a few good blog entries, but for the frequency of postings, most had little content. Many postings were polls such as ""Who will play at the super bowl halftime show in 2020?"" and ""What type of particle do you prefer?""I did like the fact that the blogger posts lots of links, but again many had little to no physics content in them. And if I am paying for this blog, I'd rather not get a list of links and weak blog entries. You should check out the blog for yourself on the web before purchasing it.[...].If you want a lightly science-based blog, with lots of pop culture references and not much in the way of physics, than this blog is for you. Otherwise we will just have to wait until Amazon gets some decent physics blogs!"
5,Fun for young and old!,"This game is the perfect ""first game"" because it is simple, short, and so much fun! My 2-year old LOVES IT!! Sadly, we lost the dice right away, but I easily made a new one with some markers and a small block. My girls and I laugh so much when we play this, and it is nice that up to 6 people can play! The size is perfect for bringing anywhere, and I am sure you could make up some fun variations! Also fits great in stockings and Easter Baskets!"
3,Meh.,"I generally love Haba toys, but this one falls a bit short. It's a cute game, but it's so small. The size interferes with the playing of the game and makes the cost seem unjustified. I would steer people away from this one."
4,My view,P{arrots in the city was both informitive and a really wonderful read. I have always had an interest in Monk parrots and this has certainly been an amazing eye opener. A truely wonderful book for anyone who loves parrots and maybe for those who should learn a little tolarance for this noble little creatures struggle to survive.
4,Whimsical and Fun,"I bought Kate Spade's book on Style because I was in the mood. I find it to be charming and light- nothing to get serious over. The water color illustrations are pretty and reminds me of sunny days and daydreams. While I know what I like, it's nice to get fresh ideas from a true designer. She talks about color combinations and collecting items you enjoy. I think she means for fashion to be whimsical and fun- nothing to take too seriously! Some of these reviewers are completley missing the mark! I do not think Kate Spade is thinking about become a famous writer!"
1,Waste of Money,"I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her ""discovery"" of this information."
1,Hello?? Is there any substance here?,"I'm a fashion design student and bought this book hoping to glean some information from it, however, I found nothing worth my while in the entire book. This is basically an inventory of what Kate Spade thinks is great about her own wardrobe and doesn't tap into any longstanding style concepts.It strikes me as being very self-indulgent on her part. As if we all care what her favorite colors and shoes are. Beyond tittering on about her own wardrobe, she makes mention of a few style standards, but ones we already heard of a million times, like how great Audrey Hepburn's look is in Breakfast at Tiffany's.Don't waste your money on this one!!"
5,Love them!!,"these books couldn't be any cuter! i've already given them as gifts to friends and to my mom. across the board, everyone loves them!! perfect gifts, not too expensive and a fun alternative to everything else that is out there! can't wait to see what kate spade comes up with next!!"
4,Good Read,"I recieved this book as a gift, and enjoyed it very much. I am a High School Fashion student, and found it very helpful in deciding on colors, patterns, and shapes of the outfits I designed. I found it a fun read, with many good books, movies, and tips reccomended."
1,"""Yeah, I'm Styling"" - Kate Spade","This book is nothing more than lists compiled by Kate to show how totally cool and styling she is. What better way to broadcast this message than to write a book about how great your tastes are. Need I say more? There is nothing new to be learned in this book, except oh yeah, according to Andy, ""Style can't be purchased."" Nevermind that any article of clothing mentioned in the book costs mucho dinero, and anything with a Kate Spade label costs big bucks, too.I would advise anyone wanting to learn good fashion advice to pass on this book."
1,Style you say? Kate Spade has NO style!,"I must be missing something but I cannot for the life of me figure out what makes Kate Spade a ""style icon"". This little book is just that, a little, nothing book. Kate Spade will never have the style or class of Jacqueline Kennedy or Audrey Hepburn. She is nothing more then a little WASP princess who happened to design a handbag that people now go into debt to buy! Having read the book and watched her segment on the ""Oprah"" show I can honestly say that I fail to see her style. Her home is a total color disaster and looks as if it was decorated out of a rubbish heap. Save your money on this book and if you must read it, borrow it from the library!"
1,Borrowed Style,"This book continues the sly Kate Spade tradition of knocking off other designers inspirations, ideas and designs and putting"
1,Not Recommended,"In this book, the author rambles endlessly attacking almost everyone for their beliefs without offering a shred of evidence in support of his own beliefs. He attacks Christians, Marxists, and various academics. The author claims that the nuclear family, based on love, was common throughout history. Is this true? I don't know and I won't know until I find another book that actually contains historical evidence. I only read the first 4 chapters of this book, so maybe it improves, but I don't have the patience to find out. I think the history of the family is an important topic, worth reading about, but this is not the book to buy on this subject."
2,Mistaken Identity - harlequin in disguise,"This somehow ended up in with the scifi/fantasy books when I was looking for a quick read. Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but i didn't see anything that would have suggested it didn't belong. It decidely should have been in the bodice-busting romance section. That being said, the ending was so predictable that i got mad enough to literally throw the book across the room. The characters are kind of flat and formulaic. I have to ask - why bother with a sequel?"
3,Predictable,"""The Wizard's Ward"" is a good book to read if you're looking for a fast read; however, if you're looking for something more in depth and more thought out I wouldn't suggest it. The plot line was at best rather simple and at worst very predictable. As of now I'm not even sure I want to read the sequel.The main character Maura sets out on a quest with an unlikely companion who calls himself ""Rath."" The two used their combined gifts of stealth, magic, and sheer obstinance to combat the enemies they encounter. On the way they come to love each other but to all appearance their destinies' do not lead to each other. However, they continue the struggle to lead the land of Umbria in a revolution against the invaders, the Hans."
3,Light fantasy.,"This book is what I call an ""easy read""--one that does not require a lot of concentration, because it lacks depth of plot or characters. Even the ""Waiting King"" business was obvious early on. I cannot see myself reading it again; therefore it is not a ""keeper."""
4,Enjoyable romantic fantasy,"As with most Luna books, ""Wizard's Ward"" is a great read for fantasy lovers looking for a good romantic story. Not bogged down in sexual exploits like most romantic novels, this book has a good fantasy plot with enough romance to satisfy your cravings.The story can be somewhat predictable, and a little cliche with the whole ""thought I was a commoner but I'm actually a queen"" thing, but that didn't really bother me, since I wasn't looking for a breakthrough epic fantasy story. The plot can be dramtic and exciting at times too, so I practically whizzed through this book.""Wizard's Ward"" is a case of what you're looking for that will affect your opinion on it. If, like me, you were just looking for a nice fluffy romantic fantasy read, you should be pleasantly suprised. But if you're looking for anything more than that, look elsewhere."
5,Hale's time has come,"If you are a Deborah Hale fan, you're going to love this story. LUNA has made no secret that these books are fantasies with strong romantic elements, and Hale delivers on all fronts. With careful attention to detail that makes the world of Umbria come to life, she peoples it with wonderful characters. Maura and Rath are well-suited, and their quest to find the Waiting King is everything it should be. Hale is a storyteller first and foremost, and while her writing style isn't for everyone, those who like her, ""like her a lot."" I can't wait for the next book in the series."
4,Pretty Good,"Basically, this is a fantasy romance novel. It's not an epic adventure with a wide array of characters on a huge quest to save the world. It's primarily about the interaction and attraction between the two main characters. The backstory is nice enough to fill the reasons why the characters are doing what they are doing, but it is by no means something epic. If you're looking for a grand tale about a woman trying to save a kingdom, look elsewhere, this is about romance. That being said, it's pretty interesting. Rath and Maura are both likeable characters and you care about what happens to them. The main gist of the story and what keeps it flowing, is of course the tension between them. I'm not sure how it would fare once they get toghether, the author doesn't seem that accomplished yet on creating worlds and huge backstories, but this book is good enough."
2,It's an ok book I guess,"This type of plot has been used before, as some of the other reviewers have pointed out. The villains had no personality traits other than being cruel. The book wasn't that well written in my opinion especially near the end. The sex scene at the end of the book seemed really out of place. The author says that Maura will face some sort of doom when she looks at the ""Waiting King"" at a certain time. But no doom happens to her really. Plus, Maura is supposed to free her people from the bad guys - there's only ONE rebellion in the entire book that she causes. I really doubt that one rebellion would free everyone in the whole country. Anyway, read this book if you have lots of time on your hands and are really really bored. Otherwise, avoid it."
2,I didn't know that LUNA was a Harlequin imprint,"If I did, I certainly would have had a different set of expectations.As it stands - ""The Wizard's Ward"" is well in keeping with the Harlequin Romance tradition - silly, immature heroine shrilly opposes the stock alpha male hero until she falls into bed with him (I read way too many Harlequins in my not-so-distant past). The sex scenes, particularly in the final 5 pages are embarrassingly bad. The plot, and its conclusion - a recycled version of the traditional Arthurian ""Return of the King"" was telescoped from the first 20 pages. Unappealling characters make the journey very unworthwhile."
1,Yamabushi's mini reviews pt. VI,"I'd call it un-readable, but, unfortunately for me I read it. The plot never `clicks' and the action is about as suspenseful as a falling leaf."
4,Easy order,"I love the product, it is very well packaged and easy to use. Everything is in a sack which you just take out the old and put in the new. Came quickly and my fishy are happy."
5,Great system,This is the best and easiest bio filter I have ever used! No parts to break as you would have with a bio wheel. This eliminates the old under-gravel filters which did work very well but required you to break down your tank every other year to clean it out. My water is beautiful. It's Clear with just a little yellowing from the hunk of driftwood I have in the tank.
5,Cant ever have too much bio media.,I use this stuff in every filter i get no matter what brand it is. When ever i set up a new tank I'll toss used pellets from other tanks into it have have a basically fully cycled tank in about a week. (but i still wait a few weeks to make sure my water quality stays steady before adding new fish.)
5,BRIGHT AND CHEERY HOLIDAY READING,"Children who fell in love with the adorable small elephants in ""Humphrey's Corner"" and ""Humphrey's Bedtime"" will be delighted with the holiday preparations of Humphrey and his sister, Lottie.Together they watch the snow fall, and help their father shovel the fluffy white drifts. They make brightly colored decorations and hang them on their tree. Decorating a special cake is also part of this happy time of year. Until, finally, it is Christmas Eve and the excitement is just a night's sleep away.Illustrated in full color and recommended for ages 2 -5, ""Humphrey's Christmas"" is a bright, cheery addition to holiday reading."
2,Nice device (when it works),"I received my tablet a day after I ordered from Amazon at no extra delivery charge, so great service from these folks, BUT, the tablet has a problem with my OS, WinXP. The tablet's driver doesn't work with a file in the Xp's stand by mode, so whenever my laptop goes into it, the system crashes. It happens daily. Another problem with Wacoms driver is that it fails to load too often. The tablet is great when it works, but right now, with the current Wacom driver I would have to discourage anyone from buying it. The people at Wacom are cordial, but they have NOT fixed the problem, even after I theatened them with posting a negative review here, at Amazon. So, now go and think before you buy."
5,A Funny and Touching Novel,"Wells spins a great yarn of a Huck-like boy from the bayou in 1960's Louisiana. Some might even claim that Wells is riding on Twain's coat-tails here, because of the similar themes of race, the absent father, and the troublesome and misunderstood truant on the run from the law.On the surface, there are a lot of similarities. Yet, Wells has a knack for going in deeper, to see these American archetypes in a new light. Furthermore, Meely and his father have a relationship that would not be defined by any as being ""normal,"" yet, a true love is evident there, and it seems as if their relationship could not exist in any other form.Read this book. You'll love it."
4,Read it in one night!,"And that is probably why I'm only giving it 4 stars-it was too short! I really enjoyed this book and fell in love with Meely, his friends, and his father. I hope to see more books by Mr. Wells; he is an extremely talented writer. And I love the cover art!"
4,A PO' WHITE BOY WINS OUT,"This is a delightful, easy-to-read novel that has a great insight to the society of the have-nots in the deep South. The main character, Meely, is a 14 yr. old that gets by primaily due to his own wits. There is a very interesting part, toward the end, where Meely is asked to identify a corpse. The results of this are hilarious and problem-solving. Believe everyone should like this story; 'tis a dandy."
3,works,"[Good]It's cheap.It cleans.Cool looking bottle.There are no weird dyes like another product from Suave:Suave Men 2-in-1 Shampoo + Conditioner, Ocean Charge, 12.6 Oz (Pack of 3)Suave Professionals Men 2 in 1 Ocean Charge Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.6 OunceIt smells alright; more on this below.[Bad]There is no peppermint smell. I really hate false advertising.The smell is really strong and it lingers. Why does every cheap product have more perfume than more expensive products? Wouldn't the manufacturer save more money by using less perfume? Using this shampoo is a great way of announcing to the world how cheap you are.There is no peppermint or menthol like feeling on your scalp.[Verdict]Decent and cheaper American Crew alternative."
3,Alright...,"This was alright, but not great. It worked really well, felt fine, etc. But I didn't like the scent very much. Luckily it's not super strong, so it won't follow you around all day, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting."
4,It gets the job done,"The bottom-line is, it gets the job done without leaving your hair sticky the next day. Like everyone says, there isn't much peppermint smell to it. After you apply, and wash your hair, the scent is completely done. Now as for the quality, it's not superior but for two-fifty a bottle, it's good enough. Similar to the Suave for Men 2-in-1 Ocean Charge shampoo, it's very foamy after you apply to your hair. Honestly, Suave for Men shampoo has improved over the years along with an increase in price too. Would I buy this again? Only if it's on sale or I get a coupon. I've used better shampoo in this price range. So far, my favorite shampoo for men is Console."
3,Doesn't smell like peppermint,"I bought this shampoo because I love shampoos that smell like peppermint and make my scalp feel all tingly, especially in the morning when I'm groggy and trying to wake up. This doesn't have a peppermint scent at all. The fragrance is sort of like a men's shampoo with some fruitiness to it. However, it does do a good job of cleaning my shoulder length hair. I like most of Suave's shampoos and use them all the time, but when a label says ""Peppermint"" that's what it should smell like. I won't buy this one again."
4,Sexy Shoes,"These shoes look fantastic on! They are very high heels, so my suggestion is to only wear them for dinner and you'll be comfortable. Worth the price."
3,Items in mirror are larger than they appear...,"I bought these for my wife...when they got here, they were much bigger (as in chunkier...I think they were pretty size appropriate) than we had anticipated. I guess we hadn't bought platforms like this online...just be sure you know that you're getting a large shoe."
2,I want to vomit smelling it.,"I feel vomitting when I smell this cologne, too strong, maybe because I try it on night time? ...... Personally, I don't like this smell."
3,It's a cologne...,"Lacoste Booster is a fairly cheap cologne but it's kind of tough to find nowadays. It's not overpowering and doesn't last too long. It's on the borderline of smelling like a woman's perfume. Basically it's what you wear when you have a controlling and nitpicking girlfriend who wants you to get manicures with her, so...if a girlfriend buys this for you because she ""likes the way it smells"" head for the hills."
3,its ok for the price.,Lacoste booster has a good opening and doesnt long. Its projection is average and longetivity is ok. Fragrance overall is decent to the price.
4,Agradable olor,En cuanto a gustos cada quien escoje. Me parece un olor agradable. No es dulce ni delatante. Los demas perciben el olor suave.
5,awesome,"It works great and the serving sizes are just right, I really like it and it was an affordable price too"
3,Handy product for the price,"I had purchased this in order to measure spaghetti more accurately. The measure measures a bit small, and doesn't stay in very well. But it all works ok, and keeps the spaghetti in good shape for the next dinner."
5,"Beautiful voice, easy listening","Although I wasn't that familiar with the songs on this cd or this type of music in general, I found myself thoroughly delighted with Elizabeth's renditions of these musical theater classics. Her voice is smooth and melodious and her operatic style lends a unity to the cd so that no song feels out of place or disjointed. They just blend seamlessly from one to another.This is the perfect cd to put on to impress your dinner guests and set a beautiful ambiance wherein your friends will feel relaxed and compelled to linger over one last glass of wine. It would also be a wonderful cd to listen to while taking a long bath to unwind at the end of the day or while taking a leisurely drive down the coast. Wherever you want to go, Elizabeth's lovely voice will surely take you there."
2,"Come on! Just add ""for Piano"" on the title please!","Friends, I am sure you like Keeny G just like I do. I bought this book to study, dreamed about one day I could play saxophone like him. When the book arrived, the notes were extremely complicated! It's impossible to play it with saxophone. I wondered what happen; several minutes ago, I finally realized that it was for piano, not for saxophone!Come on, Amazon and sellers, why don't you just add 2 words: ""for piano"" so that I wouldn't waste my money to buy a useless music book? Or, you just want to confuse buyers to make some money for your business?Friends, if you want to buy music book, make sure you zoom in the pictures and read the tinny words really close, otherwise you might waste money to buy junks home."
4,Bright & Beautiful Colors,"These crayons are super vibrant and make it easy for my 15-month old to scribble around without having to push down very hard to get any color on the page like some other crayons. Lids are hard to get off, so that means no crayon on my walls or furniture."
2,"maybe good for older kids, not a toddler","bought these last year for my daughter who was nearing 3 at the time. big disaster, they are sooooo messy. so i stored them away till she was older. now, same story even though she handles them well. we end up with ""creamy crayon"" all over her, and all over the house! maybe i'll try again when she's 5 or older!"
4,Creeeeeeeeamy,"These are fantastic, the kids love em. They spend hours of time making art and these are much easier for the little ones they other pastels.Be warned, they get on EVERYTHING!"
4,Great for kids with low tone,"I bought these crayons for my 3 year-old son who has low muscle tone due to spina bifida. With regular crayon he can't push hard enough to make a dark mark, but with these creamy crayons he can made nice, dark marks without pushing down hard. He likes coloring so much more now that he can actually see the marks he is making! The included brush is great too; he loves to color and then go over it with the brush and water. They are a bit messier than regular crayons, but they wash off easily. I'm so glad I found these for my son!"
1,"Not for 1"" map rails","Just so you know, these hooks fall off of the 1"" map rails, so don't order them for any application other than the 2"" rail."
1,Not for Beginners!,"If you are out-of-shape, obese, new to stretching or any of the above stay away from this program! This is for those fit persons at the immediate and/or above levels!"
4,music,Is a personal choice- but I think it can be a positive bonus to listen & learn different & interesting things!
5,Perfect size/Perfect Deal at Amazon,"The 6x8 Intuos2 is the perfect size for your desktop or laptop. Wacom finally did right and released a neutral color version for those with a sense of style--and let's face it, all artists do! Honestly, the plastics of the pen and the tablet doesn't look or feel like a nearly $300 piece of technology, but it works like a dream. The mouse with the scroll-wheel only works on the tablet itself, a fact that I didn't realize when purchasing it. The mouse really doesn't fit my tastes for handling and is sluggish, but nobody buys it for the mouse anyway. Pen and tablet are great. Those wannabe artists can really expand their talents with this tool. Invaluable.Also, Amazon has the best price and shipping options available without a doubt."
5,A sophisticated thriller that educates and entertains,As I am a usual reader of non-fiction literature this genre was a risk; but what a fine reward for taking that risk!The book just takes off from page one allows you to get your bearings a bit and then accelerates about page 80 until you're really flying. What a ride! The education about global business will appeal to any non-fiction reader too! Read this book
4,"CD included, and its good!","Overall, this is a good buy, and as others have noted, a great staple for the floral designer. I love the disk - you can run a search for ""pink flowers,"" for example, and all flowers with pink variations fed back to you in list form -- you are then able click on the list for pictures of each flower. I wasn't sure if the CD would be included (although it is mentioned on the cover of the book in the picture shown, it is not referred to in the product description) and was pleased to see it is indeed part of the package. I only wish they showed all the color varieties for each genus--instead, there is just one picture and the color variations are listed. With roses, for example, it would be nice to see the many popular types used in common arrangements --vendelas, cool water, versalia...."
5,Love Love Love It!,"I'm 21 and I run my own flower shop. I know my way around a design bench, but unfortunately my inexperience has left me with a limited knowledge of cut flowers and foliages. This book has helped me so much! And the CD Rom is amazing. You can search for flowers by species, family, even color and distinguishing characteristics! Definately two thumbs waaay up!"
3,Not for die-hard Speed Racer fans!,"I personally was disappointed in the new ""Speed"", however, my kids, aged 3 and 5 love it. They watch it all the time and if that is any indication, then the movie is good. I say stick with the old!"
3,An Evening With Dave Grusin,"I entirely agree with the previous review. I almost returned it due to interview clips being overlayed onto the actual concert in progress. The first one pops up during the young bass player's solo, as if the bass solo isn't important and Gary Burton's comments about Dave are. Later the percussion player is overlaid in an interview segment talking about how great it's been to play with Dave over the years and they have him talking over his featured solo in the concert.And besides the buttons not working, no chapter stops, there is no minutes counter either. The display reads ""play"" throughout.I'm a fan of Dave (and he and Larry's old CD label), but I won't be buying another of these productions like this. Leave the interviews in the extras section and let the concert be a concert. (Also it has DTS-HD Master as an audio format, not mentioned anywhere on the labeling.)"
1,Don't buy it. This Blu-ray is a fraud!!,"Don't buy it. This Blu-ray is a fraud!!Don't get me wrong: as always, the music of Dave Grusin is wonderful.Not only this recording last an hour which is already really short but the film is interrupted many times by phrases (Not even real interview) of the players in the middle of the songs.It looks like a very bad documentary on the concert.Choose the CD. You won't have the image but the music stay unspoiled."
1,Disappointing,"What a missed opportunity.This misguided Blu-Ray can't make up its mind. It never decides if it's a register of the concert or a documentary on Grusin and ends up being neither. As other reviewers have stated, it can be infuriating when you get spoken words overlaid on the music track. For instance, Grusin's narration spoils the effect of the gentle, sparse notes during the beginning of ""On Golden Pond"". Adding insult to injury, his fabulous solo from ""The Firm"" is relegated to the end credits scroll.Also, the Blu-Ray itself has several problems, like the lack of chapter stops and the fact that it won't display the timing during playback.A sorry release that reminded me of ""Lalo Schifrin: Movie Music Man"", another documentary/concert combo that was released a decade ago and also undermined the work of a great artist.Buy one of Michel Legrand's concerts instead. They are way more enjoyable than this one. Grusin deserved better."
3,Missing music,"This video concert was sonically great, the visuals good (as would be expected on blue ray), but the lack of chapter searches, and the elimination of three tracks that are on the CD is unexcusable! Don't expect to hear: Suite from the Milagro..., Peter Gunn, or the Memphis Stomp. I expected better!"
3,saddle bags,This looks very cheeply put together the seems where on the outside instead of on the inside. The lines that where drawn on the bag for where they where suppose to sew it together where still visible. Other wise very large. I will never buy another bag from them again.
2,The chrome looking studs,The chrome looking studs all rusted within a month. Now I have to buy the real chrome studs to cover the rust!
4,Real leather,"Item Code - SB2-Plain : Big Motorcycle Sissy Bar BagIt is surprising to get a leather bag instead of vinyl. The only complaint after one trip is the metal clips on the top roll bag are cheezy and hard to work. You will probably have to use bungee cords to stabilize the bag, but that is a problem common to this style of luggage."
4,Critical Thinking with I Spy,"I love these products for their critical thinking, language development, and problem solving. I would have ranked it at 5 if there were more puzzles. My 4 and 5 year olds completed it in only two sessions, the rest was review, but still great and engages their imaginations."
1,It Caught Fire!,"I used it with a light load for over 2 years, but then one day it started making sizzling and popping noises. Acrid smoke came from the surge arrestor and the computer began to malfunction. This thing obviously has a design flaw and I am surprised it hasn't been recalled by the manufacturer."
2,tranformers slip out,"looks good and i like the relatively flat plug into the wall. but the nice tapered design is actually flawed with the tranformer rows along the sides angling downward away from the center. this downward angle causes heavy transformers that overhang the lip to tip over and lever the plugs right out of the sockets. it doesn't help that it's hard to insert the plugs initially, but once you do, they are gripped very loosely. i had to solve for the tilting tranformers by putting supports underneath them to keep them level."
1,Too Expensive...,"This is a good quality Quinoa but it is too expensive. I found it much cheaper (same quality product organic, prewashed quinoa) in a local chain store (Costco). It only cost about $10.00 for 4 LBs in that store. Amazon price is $30.00+ for 6 lbs. we all have to tell Amazon to reduce the price for this product. I don't recommend anyone to amazon.com for this particular product. I received broken package but Amazon was very kind to provide me a replacement with in Two days."
1,Careful!!!,"It is possible that you crack a tooth with this quinoa. There are other stuff in there that I tried to ignore for a while. I did find, though, a quite big piece of clear hard plastic (hard and sharp--feels like glass). I am returning it and won't be buying again. If you have already bought a pack and you don't want to throw it away, make sure you check it before you cook it, ESPECIALLY if you have children, and eat it slowly. I ordered mine sometime in December, if that helps."
2,Lots of tiny stones.,"Sadly I found lots of tiny stones in the batch of quinoa I received. Other than the stones that order was perfect, fast shipping, great packaging and fresh looking quinoa. But I will not be eating any more of this quinoa for fear of chipping a tooth. It's not a pleasant eating experience when every few bites you get that awful crunch from a stone.I'm going back to the 'Ancient Harvest' brand. I've never had such quality issues with Ancient Harvest."
5,Good when you know how to cook it!,"Quinoa can be very bland. Bob's Redmill is very good quinoa but if you don't know how to cook it than any brand you buy won't be any better then the rest. There are a bunch of Quinoa cookbooks on Amazon. The one with the most variety of recipes for jazzing up your quinoa is 201 Best Quinoa Recipes. Read this book and enjoy your quinoa!201 Best Quinoa Recipes: How to Make Healthy and Delicious Quinoa Soups, Salads, Breads, Desserts, Pancakes and More in Your Own Kitchen (Volume 1)"
5,Eating better is easy with this stuff,"Quinoa is one of the healthiest foods you can eat, and this is a great way to buy it. Bob's is pre-rinsed and nicely packaged for storage in the cupboard. Shipping was very prompt from coast to coast (two days). Finding quinoa in the grocery store has been difficult, and when I do find it, I have a hard time buying a little 8oz box for $5.50-ish. I prefer bulk, a reliable brand name, and super fast shipping. When ready to buy quinoa again, I will come to Amazon. Please note that the pre-rinsing factor is a big deal. If I had to do that part myself, I probably wouldn't bother with quinoa at all (the seeds are so tiny). As it is, preparing the grain is actually very fast and convenient, and I am therefore inclined to consume more of it! Highly recommend."
5,The best brand of quinoa I've found,"The brand you buy matters more for quinoa than many other grains. Quinoa grows covered with a layer of bitter compounds called saponins. You want a brand that's been well-washed so you can cook it straight out of the bag. Beware! Most brands say that they're pre-washed. That doesn't mean that their quinoa won't require yet more washing before it'll taste good. Bob's Red Mill does a great job, with no bitter taste whatsoever, even when the quinoa is cooked like rice in a small amount of liquid.Also, some brands do a really bad job separating the quinoa from the chaff. I've yet to find anything but quinoa grains in Bob's packages.This usually isn't the cheapest brand of quinoa available. But, to me it's worth spending a little more to have quinoa I can just measure and cook, without having to rinse it more or pick out bits of detritus."
2,Pricey,"I had a scheduled subscription for this item and the quality was good. However, they suddenly decided to jack up the by ~ 30% and at that point i canceled the subscription.I now get 4 lbs of organic quinoa in one of the big warehouse chain store for 10$ and this seems such a rip-off."
2,Normally love this product but...,"...the quinoa in the latest shipment of packages was bad. I did not know that I could have bad quinoa, but this was the case. The seeds did not cook well and I thought it was my rice cooker (which is I high end cooker). In going back and forth for a few months with the manufacturer to get the cooker fixed I decided to try a smaller box of quinoa that I purchased from another vendor and it cooked up fine. I tried another batch from the Red Mill and again it turned out ""rotten"". The same was with the next bag I opened. At this time it was too late to return the seeds for a refund and I don't know how to talk to someone from Red Hill. I am nervous to order another, quinoa is eaten daily in my house, because that is a lot to order to throw away.Just be aware."
3,Not as washed as you might like,"The quinoa itself doesn't stand out, but it isn't really bad. However, anyone who is picky about washing it beforehand may be disappointed. After reading previous reviews, I expected to be able to cook it without washing, and did so. Just as background, the bitter saponins that get washed off are also surfactants like soap, and will result in foamy water. I definitely noticed much more foaming and bubbles during cooking than with fully washed quinoa, and the result was noticeably more bitter.This could potentially be a batch issue, given others comments. As I received four packages, I'll test them as I use them and update my review.------Update: I've continued to use my remaining stock of this brand. Again, the taste is fine, but it definitely requires significant washing for all the bags I've had."
5,The perfect grain and a great price,"Quinoa is a nutritionally complete grain -- unlike most other grains -- it has all of the essential amino acids. It cooks up like something between cous cous and rice taking on the flavor of the cooking liquid. Basically, this is an ancient grain who's time for a comeback has arrived. I haven't run any through my grain mill yet but that's coming soon so I can make bread (with a hard red winter wheat mixture)."
5,Great!,"Great tasting, healthy and you can't beat the price. If you are unsure about what to do with quinoa, just start mixing in things you like. Have a small child, mix in some sugar and vanilla and sprinkle chocolate chips on top. Oh, and cook it with milk to get the added benefit of calcium and vitamin D."
2,very expensive,Quinoa was very good quality -however very expensive. 26 * 4 =104 oz ie 3120 grams ie 6.878 pounds .with subscription costs 31$ which is $4.5/LBs . I found out that simmiller organic quinoa in number 1 wholesaleclub costs $9.85/ 4 lbs bag .which is almost half the price .
5,Delicious AND healthy! Wow!,"I've recently made efforts to eat better and, let me tell you, ALL of Bob's Red Mill products are a godsend. Quinoa is easy to make, versatile, and packs some serious health benefits. The package it comes in doesn't look like much but the seeds cook up to 4 times their size, easily. So a little goes a long way both in that sense and that it's pretty filling too! I use it as a side dish, in soups and stews, and I imagine that with the right ingredients it could be used for breakfast as well!I'm a carb addict and this, while not low carb, is definitely better than the empty and processsed carbs that I used to eat. If you're looking for a low carb option that's similar to rice, check out TVP granules. Only 3 effective carbs per serving and even easier to make than this stuff!"
1,Grit!,"I've had some entirely adequate experiences with this quinoa, and was able to ignore the odd uncomfortable crunch. But after cracking a tooth, I decided to just throw the rest out."
1,Overpriced Garbage,"There is so much Grit in the product (Tiny little stones), that they are in every single bag, in every single breakfast serving that I've had. You're chewing then you get a hard CRUNCH (probably not that healthy for your teeth chewing stones!) Not only that, Bobs brand is HORRENDOUSLY overpriced. What are we paying for? I'll be getting my Quinoa elsewhere thank you, for much cheaper and a higher quality too! I'd rather support a company that doesn't gauge the consumer and does it right. :)"
4,Nice Source of Protein,This is a great source of protein if you are trying to get protein but want to avoid chloresterol. you might find it needs a little salt but that is typical of beans. It also reheats well in the microwave but use a cover incase they pop and make a mess. - The subscription plan is convenient but be careful because they can really start to pile up and be a hassle if you arent using them fast enough. It is easy to find receipies for this and hard to find in the stores.
5,Best Tasting Grain Ever,"I just love Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa. Do not have to rerinse this product. Goes right into boiling water, and tastes absolutely wonderful. Will never eat rice again. Just wish I would have found this years ago."
4,beating cancer,"want to beat cancer? This is the book to read, must have info on basic vitamins and minerals to make cancer cells unwelcome, lots of hard to understand jargon, but if you read the simple bits, it's quite easy to comprehend and put to use immediately. I was given a cd of robert barefoot and it so inspired me to look up the book, I wasn't let down. Trust the authorities to hide the easy answer's from us because they are afraid of losing their income from the drug industry"
4,Trying to save my son's life,"Barefoot on Coral Calcium: An Elixir of Life? Health Secrets of Coral of OkinawaMy son, 39, has Stage IV cancer. Chemo and radiation and blood transfusions have been miserable for him, but he has endured them to stay alive. I want more than that! I want him to be cured! What I read in The Calcium Factor has given me hope that we can beat the cancer WITHOUT giving up the traditional medical treatments that have kept him on hold for months. The information is easy to read and understand and is almost complete in terms of my questions about the regimen. I am also following a smaller version of the program to ward off aging diseases, all of which can grow worse or get better or not happen at all if the premise is correct. Only time will tell whether we have found the magic that will restore my son's vitality and give him back his life."
4,Good but best for medical pros,"This is the first of Bob Bearfoot's books on Coral Calcium and is a good starting point. His following book ""Death by Diet"" is written more in the vernacular of the non-medical people most in need of the information contained therein. I recommend they be bought as a package."
3,Interesting,Robert Barefoot may be on to something but there really is not much information to back up claims. The whole book seems to be an advertisement for coral calcium. Pages and pages of testimonials seem to be filler for the content. The author took a few chemical calculations and made a whole book on just a few ideas. Not bad but could have been done in a pamphlet or newsletter style and been just as complete.
1,Total crap,"This is a pseudo-scientific, potentially harmful, and misleading... Don't fall for this book, which is not backed up by scientific evidence."
2,SCAM,"Mr. Barefoot's claims about coral calcium are scandalous and erroneous. Also, his claim to spend more time in the sun is a dangerous suggestion from a misinformed person. There is a strong association between increased sun exposure and basal, squamous and melanoma skin cancer."
1,Ridiculous!,"When I saw Robert Barefoot on TV, I couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry. If he's a biochemist, scientist, research etc., then I'm Abraham Lincoln. The reason that the medical community doesn't people like him is because their explanations of health and disease are utter nonsense. If he eliminates 90% of disease in his patient cohort, he will most definitely win the Nobel Prize in Medicine. It's nice to see that magic elixir salesman can still fool the medically disenfranchised.The one thing that he hasn't talked about is the horrible ionizing electron radiation from the space aliens that live on the moon. My dog has talked with the space aliens, and he found out that they don't know about the healing powers of Coral Calcium. My dog advises taking all of your money out of your retirement savings, building an underground bunker, and stocking it with Coral Calcium.I also believe that ebay has great auctions where you can buy a piece of the Brooklyn bridge for cheap!"
3,Doubt,"I haven't read his book (the 3 stars is just to be neutral) but Robert Barefoot on various of his websites and on his infomercial claimed that if you have a pH range of 6-6.5 then you should take 6 of his pills daily...first of all, death is imminent if your blood pH falls out of the range of 6.8 to 8, and I learned this in my 1st semester, junior year of college in physiology. ... This is the only point that i'm 100% doubtful of...but i do take his pills because i am lactose intolarant, so i can't drink milk, and as we all know (or at least publicized), milk is an excellent source of calcium."
1,Not impressed,"Just another book sitting on my shelf...I read it, but nothing in there just turned me around...not overly impressed."
1,zero stars a bunch of crooks,"this is a claim that robert barefoot made on his informerical. you judge for your self if this guy is trustworthy. (1)""Now a medical doctor called Dr. Otto Warburg won two Nobel prizes for discovering that this acid -- removing the oxygen was the cause of cancer."" this is what he actually said, (2)""cancerous cells can live and develop, even in the absence of oxygen."" robert barefoot also said, (1)""two Nobel prizes have been awarded for the man who discovered the cause of cancer. And he said the cause of cancer was anaerobism or lack of oxygen."" make your own judgements about him.(1) a closer look transcript http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/coraltv1.html(2) autobiography of Dr. Otto Warburg http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1931/warburg-bio.html.unlike kevin and robert i say where i get my information from."
1,Don't buy this,"I didn't read the book, but I saw the author on a TV infomercial. He has absolutely no scientific basis as to what he says, and he makes misleading statements. For example, he says that the Nobel prize has been awarded to two researchers for discovering the reason of cancer, which is not true. The reasons for cancer are many, but lack of calcium isn't one of them. I would stay away from this book and instead buy something with a real scientific basis that is supported by the current knowledge available to the medical community. Mr. Barefoot, on the contrary, is not widely recognized as an expert in nutrition, to put it mildly..."
1,This is a huge ...!! Buyer Beware!!,"Coral Calcium does not help. In fact some products may even hurt you permanently due to the presence of harmful heavy metals!If you don't believe me, check out this link from Dr Weil (a world-renowned Harvard-trained physician)"
4,Diana Rigg collected,"Being a long time fan of The Avengers, I want to know everything about my TV heroes.There's not many a biography to find of Diana Rigg, so I bought this book. Since I read it after 'Blind in one ear' from Patrick Macnee, which is stunning in it's detail and honesty, it comes a bit as a disappointment.Kathleen Tracy basicly collected every interview and bits of information she could find (quite some work in itself) and connects it all into a more or less logical order.But it's a bit annoying to read all the time from which magazine or source any remark came.It definitively gives you a more or less coherent image of who Diana Rigg was and is, but it's not exactly a smooth read.More for the devoted fan like me, I'd say."
4,The Amazing Book,"I read a book called Amazing days of Abby Hayes. It's a great book. It's about a girl who loves to write she doesn't like the job she gets, but finds out that she good at it."
4,Excellent Customer Support,"I bought the VersaCharge PRO and was initially very happy with it. Then, I had a problem with the AC plug. I contacted the company and they immediately responded. They replaced it fairly quickly. I was very impressed with their customer service. The replacement has been working fine."
3,They're not really on the couch,"Right off the bat, I realized that I would never get what I expected with this book -- a psychoanalytic assessment of the characters of TV's ""The Sopranos."" Rather, what you have is a light weight paperback with overviews of the episodes containing some interesting insight into character development and dialogue, but never really getting into the characters' heads. Perhaps we need Dr. Melfi to invite the other ""family"" members onto her couch and ask _her_ to write a book!One of the few redeeming qualities of this book is Yacowar's comparison of the Sopranos series to Francis Ford Coppola's TheGodfather films, but you have to skip to the back of the book for this.If you were hoping to really see each of the characters on the couch, you will be disappointed. If you are just a huge fan who wants to reflect on one of the greatest television shows ever created in a 1 hour read, then I would commend this book."
5,Couching The Sopranos,"Was very skeptic of this publication from the title name. Once I skimmed over the content inside, I KNEW I wanted it.Inside you will be exposed to the reasoning for actions of the characters. It offers insight to their motivations and their way of thinking.Very entertaining for those who want exposure that goes beyond the surface of the action you see in the series."
3,"Nice, but not complete","Although it doesn't offer much depth, it's a nice extra to the series.However, the biggest drawback is, that the book stops at episode 12 of the last series.The last 9 episodes are not dealt with, extremely disappointing!"
4,A good book for the specialist on Byzantium or travel reader,The author is not one who has gone this way before and is therefore giving a somewhat innocent view of Byzantine monuments in Turkey. I found in the book interesting dialogue and some helpful suggestions for visiting those same sights in May '98.
2,Inaccuracy of The Violins of Saint-Jacques,"I am taking a volcanology class in my university and I had to develop a research paper determining the accuracy of this novel to the eruption of Mount Pelee in 1902 (the eruption which the book portrays). Though the story may be interesting to a certain degree, the accuracy in relation to historical events is way off. I also found the book to be a little drawn out at certain parts, but overall an quick and capturing read."
2,Satisfactory value,"I bought this book for a friend. The material that is given is just enough. I wish that there was more. Why have they left out some of the older models and the very modern ones? Still, great pictures do give you some value for your money. Buy it if it is sale priced."
2,Save your money and get a better one.,"While this release does work, it's not that great. It sits rather high and is much larger than it should be. The finish is also sloppy. By the time they overcharge you for shipping, you're much better off to get a better soft release from one of the sellers on eBay."
3,Good But Thinly Disguised Christian Rock,"First, don't take that as a putdown of the genre. It's not. But it was not necessarily what I was expecting when I picked up this CD. I am a huge Alarm fan, but after 1991, I lost track of Mike Peters, Dave Sharp, etc. until recently. In an effort to fill in the musical gaps, I bought this release. It's inoffensive; it has Mike's standard earnest lyrics; you can hear the signature ringing guitars. But make no mistake about it: this is NOT an Alarm CD. Other than the edgy lead track, ""White Noise"", you would have a hard time calling this collection anything other than pleasant. And while you don't hear a direct refernce to Jesus or God or the Bible, the subject matter is unmistakable. It probably is not far-fetched to think that this is the CD Mike thought about making for some time. The Alarm has always had a vague spirituality woven into their music. But this was clearly Mike's opportunity to sing it loud and proud."
2,Sorry MP...,"For those of you who liked Mike Peters first solo release you will be happy with Rise, i didn't find it to be much of an improvement however. White Noise is a good track to start things off, but I felt that the lyrics were forced after that point, the rest of the disc seemed pretty low key overall. He sings about a message but it's not the same one you might be used too. If your looking to expand your old collection from The Alarm I would suggest picking up the re-released versions of their past CD's, they have some awsome b-sides and the first self titled release is now on disc."
5,Perfect for Work,"I needed extra flatware for meals at work (i.e. yogurt, cereal, salads, etc.) and did not want to take any pieces from my sets at home. This set is perfect--all the necessary pieces plus some, great quality, elegant yet simple design and all at a fantastic price. I highly recommend for anyone who needs a spare set of flatware."
4,Powerful Encouragement,"This book is a mirror of how I hear from God today. It reenforces His purpose and Destiny for our lives. When you read this book, use it for encouragement but also look up the passage in the bible and see how wonderfully it corresponds to His Word. Enjoy!"
2,Dull as...,...dry toast. Required for an international economics course. Grossly overpriced. Kept putting me to sleep. ZZzz...
5,A wonderful introduction to great economic thought,"Krugman is an excellent writer and a superb economist. This book admirably combines those traits. Krugman's grasp of economic theory and economic reality means that this is a wonderful economic history of the modern United States and explanation of why supply-side and other pop economic doctrines won't work. Buy this for the liberal and the conservative in your family, because each will learn from it."
3,Useful and Annoying,"Krugman obviously knows his economics and this book serves as a concise overview of U.S. Economic policy for those already familiar with basic economics.That said, Krugman is a whiner who cannot seem to leave his opinions at the door. I was annoyed by his excessivly negative analysis of U.S. Economic policy and I can only wonder about the source of his bitterness. His valid points are drowed in a sea of negativity that hide the the good news. Yes there is good AND bad news.I would NOT recommend this to someone that is easily impressionable or new to Economics. This book is more ""fair"" than his more recent writing in the New York Times but if you are familiar with Economics you would be better off reading his published papers."
2,The master disappoints,"After reading ""Peddling Prosperity"", I made it a point to seek out everything I could find by P.K. I have never heard international economics, free trade, supply side, etc. explained so lucidly and brilliantly. Unfortunately ""Diminished Expectations"" read as if written by an imposter: Banal, tedious explanations, a refusal to come out on any side of an issue (an ailment so common to economists), murky, confusing prose, and the ""Japan is coming, the sky is falling"" mentality characterize this book. I can't believe someone as brilliant as Krugman could have written this"
1,He gets it wrong every time,"It is amazing what a poor predictor Krugman is. You can, with about 80% probability of being right, take what he says to be wrong. This is not because he is dumb but rather because his perspective is wrong. He can analyze parts of the economy and be correct and then, right at the last moment, come to the wrong conclusion because his socialist belief system kicks in. Being an advocate for socialism and a truthful economic thinker are contradictions. He should give up one or the other. In any case, don't read this waste of time unless you are a true believer."
2,A View From Outdated Perspective,Economics has passed by the old Harvard/Cambridgeview of the world. Mr. Krugman is an excellentwriter with good sense of old-fashioned tradetheory. However the tools with which he looksat the world are outmoded and wrong. Economistsnow know that they know less about the world thanthey once thought. This important news is absentfrom Mr. Krugman's book.
2,"Didn't Realize this was ""Urban Fiction!""","Entertaining book, but I thought it was non-fiction! Whoops! This book is TOTALLY Fiction!!!"
4,Authentic prison author giving glimpses,"First let me say I am well acquainted with this author, having lived at FCI Fairton with him for three years. A genuine con making his way through a tense and violent subculture of America every day while the rest of the country worries about going over the minutes on their cell phones. Ferranti has been in the thick of it and has the credibility to write from the inside about what life is like on the ""inside"". What he has brought us is closer to the razors edge, not some street lit BS thats flooding the shelves in the wake of hip-hops glorification of the ghetto. A white kid truly coming of age in a world Hollywood only wishes it could understand. Wise beyond his years, he helped me make my way as others had done for him before. Ferranti challenges the mindset keeping America's prisons growing faster colleges and gives the reader true look inside the school of hard knocks. Read this!"
5,fantastic book,"This is an absolutly fantastic book. I havent been able to put it down since I bought it. Seth writes about prison and the terrible life that it turns people onto. He illustrates the horrors of living in prison and how it can even turn convict's into more ruthless people. The imagery that Seth portrays in his book paints a horrible picture of prison, a place no human should ever have to endure and the hardships he must go through on a daily basis in order to survive. I highly recomend this book to anyone, a great story and a masterfully written."
2,Difficult to Follow,"I want to start out by saying that I admire Seth for taking a bad experience and turning it into something positive for himself. However, being an avid reader, I had difficulty following this book. It jumped all over the place and was frustrating to read. I read it halfway through before giving up. It was disappointing."
5,"Stephen C. Richards, Professor of Criminal Justice","As a former federal prisoner, now professor of criminal justice, I know a little about federal prisons. I have also known Seth Ferranti for a number of years, corresponding by mail. Prison Stories is a fast paced good read written from the heart. Ferranti tells stories about people in prison, how they live and die, how they do time and survive day to day. His book demonstrates that we now have over 2 million people in jail and prison, most of them victims of a senseless drug war that has now raged over 25 years. Meanwhile, Seth sits in prison, while his mom and wife wait for his return home. I look forward to the day when this talented author is free."
3,"OK, but not exactly what I was hoping for","I was hoping for more instruction on the planting of flowers, plants, trees, etc, and how to care for them. The book does have some of this information, but also spends a lot of time discussing landscape architecture. If I had wanted that kind of info, I would have bought ""Landscaping for beginners"". It also discusses time frames for when you should be completing tasks, such as pruning, planting etc., which doesn't seem to be relevant to my geographic location. It would have been better if it had divided the tasks by region. Overall, has some good basic tips, but needs to spend more time on HOW to garden."
2,Good introduction to emotional intelligence,"This book reads more like a pamphlet than a book. The content is good but very basic after having read Gottman's Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child. I initially thought this would be a helpful addition to my library of 'feeling' books for kids. It was not. It is not a kids book but an explanation of types of emotion styles used in parenting geared towards parents. Overall, I had high hopes for this book which fell short."
4,Good Children's Book,"This book represents a very limited group of literature on children's feelings. It is simply written, nicely illustrated, and should appeal to children trying to clarify what they are feeling, giving them the vocabulary and context with which to understand their feelings."
1,NOT for the Short(er) of Hair,"An excellent idea, very poorly executed in the form of a large, clunky appliance. The plates are more than twice the thickness of a standard straightening iron, making for a cumbersome, awkward, product. If you have hair any shorter than shoulder length, you are guaranteed burned ears, neck and fingers trying to get your hair into the plates.The curling iron portion of it actually sits atop the plates, so think at least twice the thickness of a regular curling iron to wrap around. No skinny little twists here!The 'hot air' is hot but there's not much of it, and if you are very patient it will dry your hair as you ever.so.slowly. drag it down your head.People with long, not overly curly, not overly thick hair, may find this useful, but otherwise stick with your blow dryer and seperate straightening iron for better results."
3,good and the bad,"GOOD - the different heat range, the two-in-one curler/straightnerBAD - this is my first time to ever own a straightener, but compared to the ones the professional hairsytlist use, i can say that it is def not the same...it just helps to get the frizz out...also, when it is set up too high in heat, you see all the steam coming out which helps me to think it's burning my hair. The heat range also turns too easily while i'm styling my hair. and the curling iron is def not for ppl who have short hair...it's too bulky, you won't get the same results compared to using a much thinner iron."
3,No way!,"I bought a NEW ctx 15"" lcd monitor, but I also got 2 dead pixel, a bummer. Yet it happens, so I just ignore the one dead pixel near the center, and the other near the top, which is hardly noticable. Anyways, great picture, bright and sharp, but mine just happen to have the dead pixel, but now I want a 17""."
4,A wonderfully written book.,"This thought provoking book is a real find. If you're willing to look at your habitual behaviors surrounding money and do the exercises, especially when you think ""This doesn't apply to me"", this book is guaranteed to illuminate hidden patterns allowing change to take place."
5,Love it!,I want to watch all 10 chapters now. Can't wait for them all to be sold on Amazon. I can't bear to buy boot leg copies anymore.
5,Great Reading,"Janet Weinbergs book ""Still Going Strong"" is wonderful. Very much worth reading. Each womans poetic verse or story is an insight of her life and emotions.After we reach the golden age of 50 we all have experienced our joys and sorrows, but we are old enough to know and appreciate that no matter how old we become, there is always a new tomorrow.Aging is a privilege, and despite wrinkles & whatever infirmaties we may have, you're never too old to venture into something new and enjoyable.This book embraces all women from varied backgrounds. We all have earned the right to be who we want to be, and to be loved by those who love us and by whom we have chosen to love.This book is truly a celebration of life after 50 for women.Ruth LeventhalAge 69"
4,"Love This Video, But...","I have had this video for a while, and love watching it again and again...I just wish that this particular Reunion was available on DVD. I have searched relentlessly, to no avail. Does anyone know who to contact? My home library is almost exclusively DVD, and now with the newer DVD technology, HD and the like, VHS is so dreary, such a retro format. I know it's just a minor gripe, but if anyone knows where to get this on DVD, please post here!!! An Absolutely Wonderful Show!!!"
3,"more skit, less (...)","The Carol Burnett show is a scream. Any fan knows that. This tape, and I should have known better from the title, had way too much reuniting. I felt like a guest at a party where I was the only one who didn't know anyone else. All of the old cast sat around on the stage and talked about the skits that I wanted to see and then they would show a little segment. I wanted to see all of the skit and skip the stage show. The finale went on and on. It seemed like it went on for 2 hours. I wanted it to end so bad I was pulling my hair out. The skits featured were of the best- you will laugh-guaranteed. Just have remote in hand to fast forward through the commentary."
4,as a gift,"While I lived and traveled in Thailand, a friendly rice farmer gave me hospitality in his small hut while I was sick. I recovered and gave him the Sow Pig as a gift. He put in front of his hut and he loved it. He often thought of pork chops but he was a lover of rice only."
3,Not Your Ordinary Disaster Book,"This is not your ordinary disaster book -- where brave men race against the clock to survive. There is not much drama in the rescue of the trapped miners, though Greene vividly recounts the grim reality of life in the mines and the conditions of the miners as they awaited rescue.What's most interesting about the book is the media reaction to the rescue and how the men reacted to their 15 minutes of fame. The hilarious attempts of segregationist Georgia to get some free publicity by giving the men a vaction, only to find out that one of the miners was black, is well told.Most compelling is the story of Maurice, the ""singing miner"" who was lionized by the press. His peers come to resent his temporary fame. Maurice finds that fame, in addition to being fleeting, confers little real benefit and pales in comparison with the rewards of family.A good read."
5,A must read book!,The writer of this book does such a good job in painting the picture of lives of these in this book about life and the dangers of coal mining!
3,"Disappointed - written as ""soap opera non-fiction""","There seems to be a new writing style out there that is a cross between fiction and non-fiction (not faction), so let's call this style ""soap opera non-fiction"". That's where an author takes a historical event, and trys to write it like a ""soap opera"". The last two books I've bought have done this. I guess the object is to make the book appealling to more readers and therefore make more money.This was a fascinating story that could have been better told if it was written from a documentary or historical perspective. I wanted to learn something, not read a made-for-TV movie.I still don't know how the Governor of Georgia and his exploits fits in this story? That is a bizzare and dis-jointed side-story. She somehow tried to tie-in perceived racial incidents surrounding this tradgedy.I was dissappointed in this book."
3,Only fun if you have all the books memorized.,"I LOVE Dr. Seuss. And I love his books. But this game is too much. Either the questions require virtual memorization of a Seuss book like this: ""In 'If I Ran the Circus,' which character has a crab apple shot off his head by a Blindfolded Bowman? a)Morris McGurk, b)Sneelock, or c)Bartholomew Cubbins"";Or the question is really easy, as in this question: ""He sat in a terrible prickly place. But he sang with a sunny sweet smile on his _______: a)face b)grace c)lace. ""If you knew the answer to the first question (Sneelock), this may be the right game for you. But if you are just a Seuss lover, you might want to skip this game. Sorry."
4,You Will Need to Know Your Seuss,"This game is not one for Seuss lovers- it is a game for Seuss know-it-alls. If you quote Seuss in your dreams, this is the game for you. If you merely love Seuss, you will need to brush up on your Seuss trivia before playing. The questions are not all on the same difficulty level, and that also makes it not an excellent game. But it is fun and you do learn..."
3,Media dashboard a sleek addition,"Most computer cases force you to grope around among the spaghetti in back to plug in your USB devices, earphones, memory card readers, etc., which can be very un-handy. The ULTRA media dashboard installs quickly in a 5.25"" slot in the front of the computer, putting all those handy pluggy-innies right up front where they belong. A great addition to anyone's computer!The directions are clear, and most components plug directly into your motherboard, making a very clean installation. My only complaint -- let's call it a suggestion -- is that the s/p dif, earphone and microphone jacks have no provision to plug directly into the motherboard. Instead, you route the wires through an expansion slot cover (provided) and plug them into the usual jacks in the back of your case. It would be nice if the ULTRA folks would provide motherboard connections that keep all the wires inside the case. A tiny suggestion to improve a very fine product."
1,Cables de conexion,"Se esperaba que el producto tuviera salidas de audio y Firewire, pero resulto ser que son cables de extensión para ser conectados en el backpanel. Realmente no vale lo que se paga por el producto .... no desperdicie su dinero"
4,Witchcraft from a Different Point of View,Canadian Witch Robin Skelton writes from the old English witchcraft point of view. This is a good book to buy if you are looking for information on the Traditional Craft and its more structured way of looking at things. If you like Scott Cunningham's works this is probably not a book for you. It is an interesting addition to you book shelf if you want something from a historical point of view. Skelton was one of the first Witches published in Canada.
1,I would not suggest this book.,"When I ordered this book it was because of the claims in the book description from Robin Skelton that, ""spell-making is a skill and can be learned by anyone with sufficient psychic energy and powers of concentration."". I found the book to contain many spells from many different times and types of religions and cultures. None of which would be benificial or usefull in these modern times. And as far as any help for ""learning skills"" forget it. There is nothing. This book talks promises and delivers nothing. I also purchased ""Earth Power"" by Scott Cunningham and I am very pleased with that one."
4,This book was great and helped me with my life,"there are things in there that only adults should read but things can help with almost everything.read, learn and become powerful."
4,Even You Can Learn Statistics Review,"This book was my bible throughout the first statistics online class I have ever had. It guided me through the most complex stat problems. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has not ever had statistics before. It explains concepts in a clear, concise manner."
3,Even You Can Learn Statistics: A Guide For Everyone Who Has Ever Been Afraid of Statistics.,"I am currently enrolled in a graduate level program in mathematics. This book was recommended for those of us who were nervous about taking a course in statistics. We used it, abd it worked out as an excellent resource."
2,Still statistically challenged,"I was hoping this book would be the MAGIC book to help me even understand the BASICS of statistics. It didn't! I must just be a mathmatically challenged individual that there is no hope for. My husband (who is very good with numbers) told me this was a good book. So, I guess if you are good with math, this book will help you. But, if you are like me there is no hope for you!!!"
2,Average First Book of Poems,"I read this book after two different people recommended it to me. I should mention that both people who recommended the book are friends of Barot's. I found this book to be rather average in terms of first books. I wasn't impressed, and I wasn't annoyed. I am not sure what to make of all the attention this book is getting on Amazon; clearly Barot has friends and enemies. This book lead me to believe Barot has talent, but like many first books, the talent has yet to be realized here. Many of these poems are too hermetic, too in love with beauty to see the real subjects behind the poems. That this book won a contest doesn't surprise me. I am sure it is better than the vast majority of book manuscripts being entered in the contests. But in the grand scheme of things, this book is simply a signal there might be better things to come. This is a book worthy of a read, just not worthy of a purchase. Check your local library."
2,Little More Than Precious Verse,"Rick Barot, like a handful of other younger poets, comes highly recommended by many. I was actually quite excited to sit down with his book when I got it. Unfortunately, this is another first book filled with poems about visual art and high culture. Very little happens here outside the world of Art. You have to wonder if this younger generation has a camp for a select few where all they read and study is Elizabeth Bishop, James Merrill, Amy Clampitt, and their poetic offspring J.D. McClatchy, Henri Cole, and Elizabeth Spires. So many of the poems in this book are cold, dull, artful but lacking, for a better word, soul. This book is not very different from books by Barot's contemporaries also under the spell of Bishop: Quan Barry, Pimone Triplett, C. Dale Young, etc. If one had to read one of these poets, read Quan Barry. At least there seems to be a passion behind her use of culture and high lyricism and not just a need to sound intelligent."
2,good product,you don't get what you pay for. you are better off buying everything separately.don't spend money on this product.
2,Entertaining Movies Poor DVD,The entertainment industry again shows how little they care about quality but they are well focused on our money. The first movie has been transfered to DVD with some care and includes bonus material. The second movie is at least in widescreen format but a bit faded. The last two are in lousy full screen format and no effort was made to provide a quality DVD; the picture is very grainy and faded.
4,Great films...2 great DVDs.,Not sure why they gave the royal treatment to the first two films and not the other two. Seems sad really to have such an incomplete set. As for getting the German set...they are converting it wrong. It comes out to about $51 shipped for the German set after conversion. No real savings and you must have a R2 player.
2,"GREAT SET, but go Region 2 if you're learning european langs","I spent the same amount for a Region 2 european with several subtitles and German, Italian, and English dubs... And to think of the hundreds of dollars Americans spend on tape sets to hear dialog by native speakers in another language. (Search Herbie on Amazon.de to find ""Die Herbie Collection (4 DVDs)"" for example and notice the price and the language selections, and check into a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player if you haven't already)The video quality and 2nd language dubs are great on the Region 2 DVDs! Thank God i didn't jump at this. I'd have felt ripped off to get these and find they only have English tracks, when i could've spent the same money to get the language extras! (And yes, any ""Multi-system"" Region Free or R2 DVD players will play the German Bought DVDs on an American TV)"
4,THE FIRST IS THE BEST ALL IN GOOD FUN,"The Love Bug is a very entertaining Disney Comedy and the 2 disc special edition which is included in this box set is excellent. The other three sequels are not as good, but still good family entertainment. If you find the box set at a fair prce,buy it.The Transfers aren't bad,but they could be better."
5,THE LOVE BUG,THIS IS A WONDERFUL SET OF VIDEOS FOR LITTLE BOYS WHO LOVE CARS AND TRUCKS. MY GRANDSON BEGS TO SEE THEM EVERY TIME HE COMES TO SEE NANA. ( HE IS THREE YEARS OLD.0 I EVEN ENJOY WATCHING THEM MYSELF.
4,great collection on Herbie,I love all the movies. It is really neat to have the whole set. It is a great addition for any Herbie lover. I named my Smart Fortwo Herb after Herbie.
5,ahna kick a hole in the sky,Considering I am the author of this recording and have not provided it to you to sell I do wonder how you acquired a copy of it and gained authorization to sell it.sincerelyrobin lee berry
3,It's good only if you like covers,"Note: None of the songs on this or the other CD's in this series are by the orginal singers/artists. They are all faceless covers by session vocalists. This is good if you like that, but people who want the hit singles by the orginal singers, keep looking, boys! The main lure is the quite sexy cover boy in the CD cover."
1,What?,"As a member of the album's targeted audience, I'm completely and utterly insulted at the lack of taste for this compilation. There's not a single good song on here, and it smacks entirely of commerciality."
5,I Love This CD!,"I haven't taken this out of my car CD player since I bought it. Strong productions and great vocals. I love the mix of older dance classics (""Disco Inferno,"" ""Winner Takes It All"") with new hits (""Love At First Sight,"" ""Underneath It All""), plus the obscure (""Menergy""!). Definitely a lot of fun and worth every penny! I'll be buying Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, plus Let's Hear It For The 80s Vol.1 ASAP. Highly recommended!!!"
2,Strange book,"Have you ever read a book that you don't like at all and you can't stop reading it?Well, this book is a story of three brothers that are MD, the big one make anything he wants, everybody loves him and everything that he does is always perfect (that story is pathetic).The second brother nobody likes him he is always fighting with everybody but he wants to make good to all the people no matter if they have or don't money (this is the story that really counts and the one that make me read the book)Their sister, just skip all the pages she is included, it doesn't say anything.At first of the story you will think that this book will be about medical cases and corrupt doctors, but after 100 pages you will see that the book is the story of these three brothers and what is written of medical problems is minimum, so if you decide to read this book don't expect a medical book, expect a novel of a story of one selfish doctor, one regular doctor and the other one (the sister) just don't read it."
4,The Healers,"The Healers, by Gerald Green, a 500 page tome published in 1979, has been in my personal library for many years. It's a story beginning in 1950 centered around brothers, one an ambitious cardiologist who achieves the position of chief resident at his hospital and who has a penchant for beautiful women and the extravagant life style.The other brother is perceived as an angry ""loser"", but becomes the doctor who would come to fight against poverty, disease, and corruption. His battle brings him to the point of exposing his own brother's corrupt hospital administration.The sister of this medical dynasty is a psychologist whose ambition drives her into the field of network TV news where she becomes romantically involved with a married network VP.An entertaining read for those drawn to the medical world."
5,A great product,"The FireLite USB 40 GB portable hard drive is incredibly easy to use, and its small physical size makes it ideal for carrying important files with you. The 40GB capacity provides ample space for backing up documents, archiving photos, and for transferring info from one computer to another. In addition to the USB cable, the Firelite comes with a connector for powering the device from a PS-2 port. However, I have found that the Firelite works fine with the USB connection on all computers to which I have connected it."
5,6+ years and still ticking,"My review of this is pretty simple. I purchased this in 2004, use it virtually every day on my laptop and PC, and it is still ticking."
1,Could not get WinXP to recognize device,"Connected to my computer, XP sees the device but (despite what the manual says) it would not give access to it; keeps asking for the driver. Smartdisk site says no driver required, when you try to get tech support, you have to register, but the site does not recognize your user-id if you do register.Recommendation: Stick to western digital, maxtor or other recognized brand."
1,The worst gum you will ever taste,"Do not buy this product! The ""cinnamon"" flavor lasts two seconds, and then you are chewing an unpleasant, flavorless blob with the consistency of tar. It may be good for your teeth, but it is a disaster in all other respects."
1,Garbage-stopped working after 2 months of extremely gentle use,I never even traveled with it. It just stopped working completely making me lose data.NEVER AGAIN I'll buy anything from this company. This drive is a piece of rubbish!!
1,I resent the lack of support,"I have no idea how well this memory device works, because the Viking website provided NO instructions about downloading and installing the drivers. Apparently, they believe their customers are all computer experts and need no guidance in this regard. I spent well over an hour trying to install the drivers for this device, with no success. This is inexcusable. They should simply tell the truth and say that this device is not recommended for Windows 98 operating systems. I highly resent being duped, and I also resent having to pay return shipping when this product was clearly misrepresented on this website."
1,Viking products have the worst quality,"Viking products are cheap, but unreliable. I've been burned several times before buying their products. This USB drive is so unreliable, it will break in a few month and will randomly corrupt your data. Read their BBB record, they have a D grade, it is almost the worst grade a business can get. They have over 4000 complaints per year against them."
3,Marginal Design and Quality,"This product works as expected. It is a bit chunky in size, not slim and sleek like some competitors. A nice feature is that there is a loop on both the cap and the USB side so if you attach it to something you can choose either side. It does not come with a wrist strap or any accessories. The cap can snap on the back side of the base when it is inserted in a USB port. The corners on the plastic are very sharp and can nearly scratch or gouge you when you grab it. The USB connector seems a bit wiggly in its base since it moves if you wiggle it. Smacks of low quality construction. It seems harder to insert than many of my other USB devices. This connector seems to insert much more tightly (too tightly) relative to other USB connectors. And yet, the price of this for 512MB seems quite good these days so a buyer should consider what's important to you--price or quality. Works fine but don't expect beautiful and slick design nor top quality construction."
4,Good stuff - Made in Japan,"Pretty good device. The plastic body may not be quite as sturdy as other USB keys, but it hasn't at all been an issue. Fits quite well on a key ring, and the one I got was made in Japan, so it should be fairly reliable."
3,heart children charm bracelet,I purchased this for a child - This is not a child size bracelet - I could wear it which I won't
4,Good for the price but note clear only!,"These are fine, good quality heavy plastic envelopes with Velcro clasps and the are exactly as expected. But note these are CLEAR -- not the colored versions shown in the photo which I am betting will fool many ordering these as it did me. I expected an assortment of colors. Of course, reading more carefully, I now note the ""clear"" buried in the technical details. Not a big deal as long as you know what you are getting."
4,Loved It,Turn Left At The Sleeping Dog is a delightful book. I especially liked reading about how the book got its title.
2,Think Twice,"This DVD is nothing like I expected. Robert Carmine (Vocals) sings every single song in this Live Concert out of tune. It just doesn't sound right even though the rest of the band is fine.The two stars are for all of the band's videos (4) included, which are awesome. But if you're not into that, then don't buy this. I just wonder why they had to released this DVD. Instead get their album."
2,Very disappointed,For anyone who knows the story a little bit you will be disappointed. This doc is not very long. It does not show you things you didn't know if you have a little bit of knowledge about bmf
2,This thing just melted!!!,"I gave the hello kitty speakers two stars because they did work the first couple of times we used them. Unfortunately, this product is not safe. About 5 minutes ago, I heard a loud pop coming form the speakers. When I went to investigate, I noticed a burning smell and the the mp3 player and docking station were hot to the touch. The front part where the mp3 player and docking station meet was melted and warped. I immediately unplugged it and it's now sitting outside on my back porch. I'm thankful this happened while I was around to notice it! I do not recommend this produce because it's a fire hazard!!"
1,Misguided by amazon,"I recently purchased a MP3 ,hello kitty, player for my duaghter..the website showed the docking station as if it were complatable with the mp3 player...when i tried both products together i found out that they are not..so my daughter's birthday presents were a complete let down!we could not use it at all with the mp3 !"
4,Great guitar,The guitar was in great condition the only thing wrong was the srap it is a little too small but besides that i lov it i would recomen this item to every one i know
3,Good for the price,Puchased this item for a beginner who wanted to learn to play. The quality is definitely only for a beginner wanting to learn.
3,Guitar package,"The guitar itself is pretty good for a beginner. Would have been even better without the shipping damage (should probably consider putting more padding in those boxes). The bag is horrible....cheap, cheap, cheap....I guess I shouldn't complain, you get what you pay for. It ripped the same day and kept ripping in different spots every time the guitar was put in it. If you're considering this item, make sure you purchase a different carrying case as well."
3,For Beginners.,"This guitar is an good choice for those beginning to learn to play guitar. I say this because of its affordable price. It has an alright sound to it, but nothing special. If you already play guitar and are looking for a nice guitar, this would not be my recommendation for that by any means, even if you don't have a lot of money. All in all... a decent choice for beginners who don't really know if they actually enjoy the instrument or not, but not a particularly great choice if your looking for something nice to play."
1,Aweful Customer Service,"I am VERY DISSATISFIED with this company. I purchased a guitar, and when it arrived it was broken, and I contacted them and told them that I wanted to send it back and be refunded. They sent me an RMA number (a return code). When I sent them the guitar back, since they DO NOT refund the cost of shipping, I sent it back as it was sent to me, because having it repackaged was EXPENSIVE! It has been nearly 2 weeks since the package should have arrived, and I have heard ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from this company! My money has not been refunded, and also the guitar never came back to me, so I can only assume that the guitar is, in fact, in their care. I am outraged and would suggest that you do not buy ANY product from this company, because the quality is cheap, and their customer care and service is even worse."
3,Cautiously optimistic,"I was very excited to find this item for my teen-age daughter. It arrived quickly but when she opened it on Christmas Day she discovered a crack in the neck. The company was very good about offering to exchange it but we were frustrated to find out we were responsible to pay the return shipping. The replacement guitar is a ""Crescent"" brand which appears to be a better instrument than the Austin Bazaar. She is happily strumming away now."
1,bad bad bad,"The guitar was defective and returning this product was a pain in the *ss. Not only am I out $26 in shipping fees, took 3 weeks to receive credit for a poorly made guitar."
1,Poor guitar,"Bad beginner guitar! Too cheap and strings were weak. When we took it to get it tuned, the guy wondered if we bought it for 20 dollars! Too expensive to ship it back so it sits in our garage!!"
4,decent,"this is a decent guitar for the money i spent on it. wasn't expecting much but all in all a good guitar. Bought it because my 9 y/o son wanted to play mine and it's way too valuable for that. now I just hope he gets as intrested in it as he is in his games. Great shipping speed, would DEFINETLY order from them again."
3,good for the money,"It is a cheap guitar, both in price and quality, but overall worth the money if you are looking to start off somewhere. On arrival the guitar wreaked of paint or varnish. There was excess black spray paint on the inside portion, and the outter trim (suppose to be white) was a crappy gold colour looking like it was done in 30 secs. As others have said the carry bag is garbage, offers no protection, just keep the dust off.That being said i've enjoyed learning on it, and I don't really regret getting a cheaper model to get started on. All in all, I would say the other reviews are quite accurate and the decision is really whether you are prepared to order a lower quality product."
5,Great product,"This item arrived on time, exactly what it states. great price for everything you get with it. My son loved it!"
4,Descent guitar,I purchased this guitar for my niece for Christmas and it has held up to the punishment only a teenager can put out. The cover on the other hand is quite a different story. I think it was made of plastic shopping bags sewn together. Zipper broke first time we tried to use it. But no fear there are 2 zippers. So I was extremely careful with the second one and it broke too!
5,Good 1st guitar,"The guitar is a good one for a beginner like me, but the included strings break easily. Do yourself a favor and order yourself a good set of strings, and you will be very happy with this guitar."
3,repairs needed,The guitar had to have extensive repairs. The neck of the guitar was bowed so that the strings could not be pressed down. The fret was backward and had to be replaced. My grandson has perfect pitch and he realized immediately that something was wrong with the guitar.
3,Be careful before buying this,"My husband purchased this guitar for his christmas present. He wanted to learn how to play guitar on an inexpensive one in case he didn't understand it. I wish he would have paid more attention to other customer reviews. The strap that was sent is too small, it's more like a child size strap. Also, it's not the right kind of strap, making it pretty useless. From the picture, my husband also thought it came with 3 picks and a second set of strings; it doesn't. It comes with ONE pick and no extra strings. The guitar itself looks good, and it sounds decent. I would say this is definitely a beginners guitar. If you want this for professional reasons, I would look elsewhere."
4,Acoustic Guitar By: Austin Bazzar,"The product was shipped in good condition. No scrapes, dings, gouches.The product was receieved in allotted time 2-5 bus. days,and sold new.The product came with sellers info, of being new, black guitar strap,xtra strings,sound pitch,info sheet on product, and three new guitar picks!!!Great for beginners,just learning the guitar. I would recommend, great for the price. This guitar wouldprobably sell for $240.00 bucks in a guitar store."
1,there's a reason they're so cheap,"they really are pieces of junk. buzzy, poorly built junk. the wood on the inside wasn't even cut right(it seemed like it was gnawed on by a beaver. zero craftsmanship). it was friggin ridiculous. it's not 70% off, they just suck."
3,it was for a gift,As i bought it for a gift a I do not know exactly what happened how the person feels about it thank you very much so.
2,Would not play,"While it is a beautiful guitar, it was not inspected before it left the factory. No music could be played for the first 5 frets."
1,Garbage,within getting this guitar I played for a WEEK while tuning it over and over and over... I happened upon the fact that the BRIDGE IS COMING UNGLUED! THIS IS GARBAGE! DO NOT PURCHASE
3,a little messed up,well for starters my guitar has 2 chips in the back of it i never got a tuner with it the guitar dont even have spots on it for straps so i dont know what the straps are for the caring bag is a peace of crap u dont get extra strings so all i got extra was some picks
2,cheap guitar-cheap quality,"You get what you pay for. The bridge started coming off as soon as I started tightening the strings. Doesn't sound too good either, but thats probably because the strings aren't being held tight."
2,Barcelona Full Size Guitar,"I bought this guitar for my niece for her birthday. It arrived very fast, however I am not hapy with the poor construction at all. I ordered the black one, and I had to fill in with black permanent marker around the guitar in several spots where it had been dinged and scratched off. The packaging was great, but the product itself was horrible. It's very poorly made. I have to buy some inlay/fret stickers now to cover up the splintered fretboard."
3,there are no carring bag im my item you said its free,here are no carring bag im my item you said its freeand there are no accesories thats all but the guitar was good
2,too bad,the carrying bag got ripped off the first time I touched it and the G string was broken after few minutes tuning. Too bad for a Amazon product.
4,Beautiful guitar body,"I bought this guitar for my grandson for Christmas...however, I'm going to give it to my grand-daughter for a first guitar. (I bought my grandson a different one).The guitar itself is beautiful. I was impressed.The strings are soft and ""buzzy"". I bought other strings and will restring it after I give it to her.The guitar does have a nice sound quality, and projects quite well.I'm having a hard time fitting the guitar into it's case, but Austin Bazar has assured me this is the correct case. When I recieved the guitar it did not include the accessories as described, but when I contacted Austin Bazar they had them here in a couple of days. They have great cusomer contact people. ThanksThe strap that came with is kind of ugly...but that's not hard to remedy.For a first guitar you can't beat the price!!! and new strings were only about $8.00I'd recommed this set."
1,The Product was Defective,"I was very unhappy with the product. When I received the guitar it was defective from the factory and then I had to pay shipping to return it. If it had been a return that was my fault, I could understand my having to pay shipping. But to receive a guitar that is broken and then having to pay for shipping to send it back after I paid shipping to receive it is adding insult to injury."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this guitar for my son, who's taking guitar lessons in school for the first time. The guitar came with scratches and wood chips of paint missing. The paint job was awful. My son took the guitar to school and was told that the guitar was defective. It could not be tuned. I talked the company who offered me a 50% discount or send it back for a full refund. The problem with the full refund was that I had to pay to ship it back to them. I was also advised to purchase another guitar from them that would be better quality. I was definitely not going to buy anything else from them after being so disgusted with the first guitar. I would not recommend this guitar for anyone! Don't buy! One star rating for this product is way too much!"
2,VERY dissapointed in this guitar,"This guitar was a very big let down. The paint looks pretty good in the picture, but in real life it is flat and dull. Not a nice looking guitar in any way. The sound was terrible. After a long time tuning it... it sounds better. The bag it comes with is indeed cheep and smelt of moth balls so bad that I threw it away the second I took it out of the box. We bought this for a Christmas gift for our 13 year old son. I really hated to give it to him, but was out of time or I know I would have returned it and found something a lot better. Our older 2 children have much nicer guitars from music stores, and we actually thought this one would compare. Boy were we disappointed. Do not buy this if you're going off the value it says it could be. It really is just worth the $69.99 (well the 59.99 price now)and that is a fact!"
1,Would cost to much even if it was free!!!!!!,We orderd this as a gift for our youngest. When we opened the box the finish would be the first disappointment. It is obvious that no one bothered to look at the final product. The bubbled laminate chips and scratches are having us looking for a gift worth giving. The guitar has a sound that would cost to much if it was free. The accessories are not worth using. Save your money and look elsewhere. This product is lacking in every way.
2,Had high expectations.,"It really did look nice in the picture and with what it said I was saving really made me think it was a steal...Then it showed up. Its chincy and really poorly made, on top of that it sounds like crap. All in all, its not worth what I paid for it."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Though not very original, this latest by Wiltse does in fact tell a good story and creates a greater depth to his protagonist Billy Tree (remember 'Heartland'). Billy seems to stumble around quite a bit in most of the book, missing alot of clues (e.g. the rabid dog) and shaking in his boots every time he sees or hears a gun. This of course gives him the human quality achieved in this novel. Wiltse's descriptions of the area are accurate and almost make you feel as if you're there, describing the heat and humidity, ""Like sitting in an oven, wrapped in a wet horse blanket"". A good story that is sometimes too wordy, but moves at a steady moderate pace."
4,"Finally, believable characters","David Wiltse has done it again. First he brought us the fantastic 'Becker' books, and now he returns w/ Billy Tree, one of the most real and believable characters to come around. It's rare to see a character who not only has flaws, but understands them as such. Billy is trying to settle back into his small-town life when a hangman's knot appears on his doorknob. This is the beginning of Billy's trip into the past of this sleepy little town and the secrets it keeps. Suspenseful, thrilling and a darn good read! Thanks David, and keep the books coming!"
4,Hangman's Knot,"David Wiltse curls your hair. This book was such a surprise. I really like his books, but this one was the best yet because it was such a complex plot. But I will also say that I was a little irritated sometimes. Each time I thought I knew what to expect there was a twist. I came from the midwest, not in Nebraska, but in Colorado and so a lot of what he described felt familiar. He really captures what the land is like and what the people go through living there. But the best part about the book was it's surprise ending. That was the best part. I recommend this book."
1,Buy it used...or not at all!,"This might just be the least compelling novel on the shelves today. The author demonstrates a lack of ability as it pertains to captivating and holding the reading audience. The plot is disjointed and incomplete, and after finishing the book, the reader is left thinking ""Why on earth did I buy this book, and even worse, why did I waste my time reading it""? Other than that, I thought the book was great!"
5,You won't go wrong with Wiltse,"Since abandoning his terrific John Becker series Wiltse has created another winning protagonist with Billy Tree. Hangman's Knot, the second in this series, has it all. On one level it is a mystery with historical roots, written seamlessly with thorough characterizations and a tight plotline. On another level it is a gentle but firm examination of buried prejudice in a time when everyone realizes none should continue to exist. Billy Tree is a comfortable protagonist - despite his frequent bouts with his own angst. This book doesn't pull any punches as it stays true to its theme. There are no cop outs here. Just a solid story well worth any reader's time."
5,It's very mysterious book,"The book STEP BY WICKED STEP is a great book. It's about five kids, and two teachers, and they take a field trip. They find mysterious things. This book will make you feel like your really in the story, it's kind of creepy. I don't want to give to much away, but I think it's a good idea to read this book to a class. I know they will enjoy it, I know I did."
2,Anne Fine has Better,"I know people will kill me for this but I really did not like this novel very much.Sure Anne Fine is brilliant but I looked forward to reaching the last page.The dialogue between step kids and their step parents seems realistic and theres no doubt Anne Fine is real clever and has admittedly done a terrific job of this novel.I however also found it dragged,in other words I was bored,plus the constant arguments and emotional pain within was..well,painful."
1,Travels with Alice,"It was a mistake to buy this book. It was so boring that I did not finish it. Having read a more recently published book about The life and death of Alice, I expected a better book."
5,Still Free,"Just went to Best Buy yesterday, to buy Deloussed and they've got the single for free. Volta is a group that is going to keep you guessing thorough the entirety of each track. Frances The Mute (the song) is no different. Pick this up if you get the chance."
1,This won't work as an airport extreme disk,"popped my hdd out of a bytecc fw/usb enclosure and installed it into this mad dog. it read files fine - but it will not allow you to write to the disk or delete files.on writes, it displays the msg that you cannot copy items to the destination because filenames are too long for the destination. on trying to delete, it displays error code -50. popped it back into the bytecc and all is hunky-dory,works fine directly connected to the computer in both fw and usb. if you POSITIVELY NEVER will use this enclosure on a wireless network it might be ok. stand is sturdy and drive stays cool (played my itunes all night and drive never got too hot.)goes back tomorrow. this dog has heart worms."
3,pop arthritis rub,is as good as any on the market. is it the best? don't know. arthritis is severe. haven't found any that works better than the other
5,Tiger Balm - great for arthritis!,"If you suffer from arthritis and hate the cold weather, you will be able to use this arthiritis Balm Rub well.I keep it in the bedroom and put it on whenever I get achy! There is a strong menthol aroma that comes from it.And, if you put it on and then go to bed, your linens will maintain the aroma of the menthol.This balm at first feels like fire, but once it calms down, it brings a soothing relief to those knees and other joints!I was a bit skeptical at first, but once I used it, I found it to be a great relief! Especially in the colder months of the year!"
4,No complaints here,"Pretty much does what you'd expect it to do. I had no problems running any usb device (hard drive, card reader, phone, bluetooth headset) with Vista.Looks real neat in the desk. The 4-port is a little large, I'd probably get the smaller version next time."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"Once I found the unit on the Internet, I see that it only went up to Vista and nothing for Windows 7. Belkin has no information about the unit and Windows 7 will not recognize it on any USB 2 port. Now if I can fix the 3 inch hole I just drilled in my desk."
5,Solved my problem.,"I had a gaping hole in my desk from a monitor arm that I retired, and I needed something to fill it. I also had a USB hub sitting there that kept getting dragged off the desk due to the weight of the cables. So I got this item to solve both problems. I chose it over the competition because it was a powered hub which was important for my application (charging items while my computer is off.)The only issue I had was enlarging the hole to the size of the hub. That was solved by using a hole saw. But with no place to put the center drill bit of the hole saw, I resorted to an old trick I learned from a woodworking magazine: I first drilled a piece of plywood with the same size hole (3"") and clamped that to the top of my desk, and then used the plywood template to guide the hole saw over my smaller (2"") existing hole. Without the template, the saw would have wandered all over the desk."
4,Very nice powered USB 2.0 hub,"This is very nice powered hub that fits nicely into a 3 inch opening in a desktop. It's especially handy that you can route other cables through the openings on either side of the USB sockets. My only caution is that the power supply doesn't seem to stand up well to being called upon to deliver power all the time-even for relatively small items such as a Bluetooth repeater. To their great credit, Belkin stood behind their product 100%-no questions asked. I simply emailed support, explained the problem and they quickly responded by asking if I wanted them to send a replacement immediately or return mine first. Support like this makes it a pleasure to do business with Belkin. It certainly ensures that I'll give their products ""first look"" when I want something in their field. Well done."
4,"No problems, Not a Green Light!!!!","I would give it 5-stars because it works great and I have had absolutely NO problems at all, but the one pictured shows a GREEN light, and it actually comes with a RED light, it doesn't affect the function of the hub but they should still show you what you will be receiving."
1,Would be great if it actually works...,"Bought the product and obviously drilled my desk based on its size and it turned out to be a disaster.It keeps disconnecting anything plugged to it, even a small USB flash drive. At first i thought it was the wire that came with it so i changed it, looked like it worked fine but a day later the same thing kept happening.Lost hope with it, i still have it plugged in just coz i'll end up with a huge hole in my desk. Extremely surprising as i've used many BELKIN devices and they all worked very well.Contacted the seller and they refused to send me a replacement until they have this one back, sounds fair but i'm outside the US and sending it back would cost a fortune that they will not cover. and since it's a problem from their side i would expect them to do the necessary work, not get me to run around testing it, buying wires then sending it back AND paying for all that!!"
2,"Great concept, but returning it",The Grafco Moist Heat New Wrap can be used either hot or cold. Either place it in the mircowave for the alloted time for the microwave wattage or it can be placed in the freeze for 2 to 3 hours to use as a cold pack. I purchased it primarily to use for heat on my next. The heat wrap is very comfortable around the neck and when it first comes out of the mircowave if provides a very nice heat. And that's where it ends. The product does not retain the heat for any real length of time and seems to go cold fairly quickly. For me it's not worth keeping the product if it's not going to last long enough to get some relief.
4,good early Melodymakers - very hard to find,"First Melodymakers CD. All the Marleys sound so young, particularly Stephen. An all star backing band of seasoned reggae veterans. If anybody out there knows where I can get a copy of ""Hey World"" I'd sure appreciate it. I bought it on cassette and it has the terminal squeeks. Dave"
5,Fascinating and Depressing,"Brilliant concept: the authors found 19th-century photos of Manhattan and returned there in the late 1970s to take photos from the exact same vantage points. The side-by-side results are horrifying--what a beautiful livable city New York used to be! Life was not better 100 years ago, of course, but architecture sure was.Dover--bless them!--has a whole series of Then & Now books on Boston, Phila., Washington, and other cities. There should be more: where's San Francisco? London? Paris? Local photogs should get snapping and send proposals to Dover Press."
3,"The ""Now"" is not...","Before I hit ""one click"" I could not remember why I had never bought this book before. After all... I love to see the photo comparisons of the city.But... as soon as I opened the book, I remembered why.The book was published in 1976.All of the ""now"" pictures were taken no later than 1974.So much has changed in Manhattan since 1974... that the ""now"" views are unfamiliar in many circumstances.The old photos are facinating... and the commentary interesting... but I still feel the need to take my camera out to all those sites so I can get the perspective I truly wanted."
4,Nutterzgal,"A nice retrospective of New York the way it was. However, the ""now"" of the title is somewhat misleading as many of the ""current"" photos are well over 25 years old! The cover photo of 59th and Lex is a good example of the ""now"" photos not being up to date. The bank building depicted on the North West corner of 59th and Lexington Ave, was torn down about a decade ago and has been replaced with by the contemporary International Plaza office building. Nonetheless a nice collection of photos from all over Manhattan."
4,"Good, but there are better ones","A city that has changed and continues to change with the speed and energy that New York does, invites books like these. Gillion's and Watson's ""New York Then and Now"" is a collection of photos of scenes from days past juxtaposed with recent shots. For me there are two effects of this juxtaposition: one is a sense of loss. So many of the old structures, now gone, were beautiful. But, more strongly, is the sense of admiration for New York's eternal dedication to progress. ""New York Then and Now"" gives the reader an appreciation of the labor that has gone into the building of the greatest city on Earth. However, because this is a reprint of an older book, too many of the ""Now"" shots are just as obsolete as the ""Then"" shots. It sorely needs to be updated."
4,Wonderful!...but...,"I love 'then and now' books and this is the best one I've ever come across. The early photos are so clear and atmospheric, I feel totally transported back in time when I look at them.Being able to compare what are mostly early twentieth century photographs with the photographs often taken from almost exactly the same viewpoint circa 1974-75 is fun and fascinating.The mid-70's photographs have now taken on a wonderfully 'dated' quality of their own.The only reason I give just four as opposed to five stars is because I felt a lot of areas were very much over-looked. I'd like to have seen something of the older parts of the West Village, the East Village, more of the Upper Eastside. Whereas there seem to be a lot of photographs of real 'no-man's land' districts that are rather lifeless.I wish a follow up had been published to fill in the many holes.But I love this book very much and never get tired of flipping through and noticing new things."
2,Mismatched photography,"Other books in the ""Then and now"" series have photos that are very well matched; the ""now"" photographer has taken care to use the same viewpoint and lens. That's part of their charm! With that in mind, we ordered New York, and were very disappointed; almost none of the photos are a good match. If we hadn't ordered a cheap used copy, we would have returned it."
5,Excellent summary of Oregon and Washington campsites,"General introduction provides humorous, informative camping tips for beginners. Listing of Oregon and Washington campsites with notes on their features, facilities and good directions. Maps included for each region in the Pacific NW. Recently revised for 1998."
4,great way to find and evaluate campgrounds,"Describes all of the known city, county, state, federal and private campgrounds in Oregon and Washington in one book. A must-have for people wishing to camp in unfamiliar areas of the Pacific Northwest. Combine this with the DeLorme ""Atlas and Gazetteer"" for either state and plan a getaway with confidence."
5,Don't Need a Chi,"I actually own the 1 inch flat iron. I recently visited my cousin who had the 2 inch Infiniti straightener, I used it over the weekend and was totally amazed at how fast my hair straightened with the 2 inch. This is a must have item if you are a curly headed girl who wants straight hair. I makes your hair soft and shiny and straight as a pancake. I have always wanted a Chi, but they run $100 and up, which I cannot afford. This is a lot of bang for your buck! You won't be disappointed~"
5,Awesome!,"I love the Infiniti Pro. It heats up very fast, holds its heat and does the job.I have VERY curly hair and love my Instyler but wanted a second product to have on hand.I've tried several other flat irons and they all have been a major failure. However, this one has worked great and does NOT snag my hair.This one leaves it shiny and soft. I would highly recommend this product."
4,good flat iron,"We purchased this product for our daughter as a christmas present, she wanted a tourmaline unit,(whatever that is). The product arrived eary, even at christmas time. Our daughter was very happy with the unit so far and she says it works very well. Great flat iron for the money, as they can be very expensive."
5,Love my Flat Iron,"I got this flat iron after doing research with Consumer Reports and this what the brand and type they recommended. It's great. Many heat options, not expensive... makes my hair look like if I had a Keratin treatment all the type. According to Consumer reports, this is a category where pricey flat irons do not equal better products. Highly recommend this one!"
1,Different item shown!,"I thought I was receiving the one in the picture & what I received was a complete different one. Highly Dissapointed with that. That picture needs to be updated so people can see exactly what they're buying and not a different item! Oh and the price too is lower now, smh..."
1,Waste of money...,"it broke on my second time using it, and i got it on time but i would reccomend a way better product."
3,Way better deal,"This is a decent straightener although hair sometimes gets stuck between the ceramic plate and the tongs, which may just be a defect particular to mine. It is not damaging to hair if used on the middle setting and works pretty well. The one I have I paid $80 for at Rite Aid so I feel pretty ripped off, but this is a great deal for 40!"
3,Wish it got hotter,Description never mentioned a temperature range. I also own the 1 inch Infinite pro tourmaline and it goes up to 425 degrees. I wish this one had higher settings.
2,Not impressed,Not at all impressed with this iron. It snags/pulls hair and keeps shutting off in the middle of using it. The only good thing I can say about it is it heats up quickly. I bought it locally (not on amazon) and it will be getting returned. I will spend a little extra and most likely invest in a chi.
3,This is a very good flat iron for a reasonable price!,"This is a very good flat iron for the price you pay. It is a middle of the line flat iron, and the results I get are good. My only problem is that is seems to pull on my hair, and not move too smoothly through my hair at times. The trick for me is to make sure that I have throughly brushed my hair and applied a heat spray designed for flat irons first, so my hair is nice and smooth. -"
3,Not actually dual voltage,"Don't be fooled like I was. I needed a flat iron that I could use in Europe, and I bought this because the product description says ""Auto off-dual voltage."" Not true; I'm returning it. I hope Amazon corrects this error."
1,Didn't Last One Year!,"My flat iron was received in May 2011, and stopped working this week. 4/13/2012. This is the last ConAir I will be purchasing, as the past two I bought haven't lasted."
4,Pretty good-not the best-but good,"The straightner is fine. I have thin, naturally wavy hair and it got my hair pretty straight. I thought it would make it more smooth, but it didn't. I had to brush my hair before and after I used the straightner to achieve the silky feel I wanted. Other than that, It was fine. Oh, I had to use it on the second to highest heat or the highest for it to straighten my hair quicky."
2,not good,"Did not meet my expectations! I would much rather spend $100+ , you get what you pay for. Getting a chi."
1,PULLS HAIR!!!!,"This straightener had very good reviews and wasn't pricey so I thought I would give it a try. This straightener in my opinion is horrible!!! I have long curly hair and I want something that will keep my hair straight and frizz-free all day. My hair kept getting caught in this straightener and pulling it out. Then shortly after having my hair done, my hair would start to get frizzy and start to curl. I returned this straightener ASAP and got a refund."
3,"Just ""ok""","This straightener really doesn't work any better than the less expensive ones. In fact, some of the cheap ones work better. If you want a REALLY good one (for coarse, curly hair), you may have to spend over $100. Otherwise, just stick with the $20-25 straighteners. They are at least as good as this one."
2,You get what you pay for,"Very cheaply manufactured, hair keeps getting snagged in the ends of the plate. Does not give the nice silky texture even with the best styling product on your hair. It is probably ok for 1 st time buyers to try something for cheap."
1,Pulls Hair,"I stopped using this straightener a long time ago and purchased a better one. I used it for a short period of time and got tired of it always pulling my hair out. I don't remember how it actually worked for straightening, i just remember the hair pulling. I don't recommend it."
5,Leaves hair looking great!,"I was looking for a cheap deal on a good hair straightener and I'm glad I chose the Conair Infinity 2"" Iron! My hair is short/thick/curly-wavy and when I simply blow dry it my hair can sometimes come out looking rough. I pass this flat iron over the rough patches and my hair instantly looks smooth and shiny.It heats up really fast and has multiple heating options which is great when I'm in a hurry and want to get my hair done quickly. The long plates allow me to take more hair at a time which is also a plus. I have NO complaints about this product."
3,"Good, but has a short life.","I've used this straightener for about 4 years, and it just conked out on me today, a very busy Saturday! I just wish it had a longer life."
2,Received a Used Flat Iron!,"I have had almost perfect luck with my Amazon orders; this flat iron was my downfall. I received a used flat iron. (Sold by Monroe Online Sales Corp, fulfilled by Amazon.) There was caked on scum, scratches, and the cords were obviously not factory-bound. Needless to say, I did not use the iron on my hair, and therefore cannot speak to it's value. Although I was excited to try the flat iron out, I will not try to reorder this iron from Amazon for fear of receiving a product from the same vendor. I am returning the product, and I am sure that Amazon will handle the return very efficiently, as I really have nothing bad to say about their service. It's their supplier that let them down."
5,"Conair CS32 Infiniti Instant Heat Pure Ceramic 2"" Straightener","My daughter loves this hair staightener. She uses it every mourning, and her hair looks and feels great. I also received it in half the time amazon said I would using regular ground shipping. We are quite happy with our purshase.Thanks :)"
4,Great inexpensive iron for occasional use!,"I'm in love with this iron, it cuts time in half for me to straighten my natural kinky-thick african american hair. It didn't cost me much and due to this economy, that's a wonderful deal. I do not need to use it eveyday, however I think that it will last me for awhile. It has a 5 year warranty on it that will be honored by FOLICA. Though, the color in the picture is not accurate, it still has this cool burgandy-red looking hue. I also like that it can reach up to 445 degrees, the 1 1/2"" inch plates gets close to my roots with ease, it doesn't smoke that bad on it's high heat setting, and last, but not least...there is hardly any residue on it's plates after use! ;)smiles!"
3,Ok...,THis straightener is good at heating up quickly and straightens well but this weird brown stuff builds up on the sides of the plates and the color is chipping off.
2,A Good beginning,I was greatly looking forward to this video because I need to practice my balance postures. I agree with the previous reviewer. The balance postures are too short in duration either to move on in developing balance or if you are slow to get into them. The thing about balance postures is you can always come out early. This is a good novice tape. If you are looking to develop beyond that this tape won't meet your needs.
3,STORY OF A SUPERHERO FIREMAN,"I noticed that Amazon.com doesnt indicate anything in the book section of what the title is about, and this isnt only with this listing lately.You cant tell what this book entails - which company produced it nor what edition, etc.For those who dont know, Joey Quesada who created the character works for Marvel Comics! He is probably restricted as to what he can do with his characters."
5,best toy of the year!!!,"I have twin boys with sensory intergartion disorder and we have been looking for a swing to use inside.We wanted one that would be durable, safe and fun . This haba swing was even better than we expected!!! they just love it!! I would buy this swing again in a heart beat. One thing that is so nice is its big enough and durable for them to ride in it together, I dont have to fight with turn taking. I just put them both in and they laugh and play . For parents who need something inside this winter for their kids to play and get out energy this swing is more than worth the price. I would recomend this swing to everyone!!!"
3,Lawn Vac,"The instructions on this unit are quite poor especially connecting the pipe to the bag and connecting the vacuum hose to the mower. When I first received the unit, the pipe would not fit to the motor but they sent a replacement right away. Another problem is checking oil as there is no dip stick to know how much you have. The unit does a very good job in a lawn area but if the leaves are very thick it jams quite easily. All in all it is still much better than raking."
3,not great quality,I didn't realize when I purchased this set that the pens are about half the size of regular pens and with fine tips. Not overly impressed with the quality of writing and true to color. Good for older kids that are gentler on the pens than a really young child might be. An ok buy for the cost.
3,Good for careful school-age children,"PROS: This marker set has fine tips for drawing detail and lots of colors. CONS: The marker tips can be pushed in if pressed on too hard, the ink is permanent, the markers are tiny and can be used up quickly. Perhaps this is not the right set for very young children."
2,Mole Chaser Windmill,"I've had a dozen of these, and they worked for me until the 'short-life' bearing fell apart and my last remaining one went kaput. Only if they used a sealed bearing would I buy any more, unless the price dropped to $4.95 with free shipping. I've gone to the solar one and so far it is working..."
1,"Save your money, they don't work.",I have had two of these windmill mole chasers in my back yard for about two months and the moles are still infesting my yard. My advice is to not waste your money on these useless devices. I have now set traps in the mole tunnels to try to get rid of these pests.
1,does not work,"Have had these for 2 years. I put up 3 of them in my yard, and moles are still present. They actually are digging 2 feet from the units. Moles everywhere dont waste your money on this."
4,so far so good but CHEAPER ELSEWHERE,We've had 3 of these up at our community farm for a couple of months now and the moles and gophers have vanished. I'm worried about what others have said about the bearings - is there any way to repair these? AND I also found them almost five bucks cheaper directly from Harbor Freight tools. They are now even on sale for $11.99!
1,HELP!,We have two of these and three of the solar mole chasers...they do not work. We see mole hills right next to these supposedly mole preventors. We have tried numerous mole killer/preventors and nothing seems to work.
3,Mole chaser windmill,"Only been in the ground for a couple weeks, I have seen less ground squirrels so it might be working."
1,Just a junk windmill.,"I have had 4 of these in my yard for years, and it does nothing for the burrowing critters. The bearings wear out in just a few months. It use to be you could call the company and they would replace the bearings for free now they want to charge some ridiculous amount. The only reason I still have them in my yard is to see the wind direction. Certainly not worth the money for the short lifespan of the bearings, the hassle of replacing them, and they don't chase away gophers,chipmunks, burrowing critters, etc."
1,mole chaser,"I bought two of these, less then two months ago installed. Both have failed due to bad bearings. They never worked long enough to find out if they ran off the moles! Do not buy, they are a POS."
1,This mole chaser SUCKS,This windmill has had no effect on the numerous moles inhabiting my garden---in fact I have mole tunnels going up to and around the pipe it is mounted on !!!! Plus after haveing in use after 3 months the bearing went out and I had to buy a new bearing ---the only readon I bought a new bearing is I am using the windmill like a whirlygig----it looks nice---
1,junk,Don't waste your money on this product. I bought one and put it in the yard. The bearings were shot within a week of average wind. This thing is truly junk.
1,Doesn't Work,This product did NOTHING to chase the two moles that have taken up permanent residence under my house. NOTHING!!!!!
1,mole chaser,"Bought two of these last year. If they did anything, they attracted more moles. Tunnels from moles collapsed this spring with rains and yard is full of ditches now. This is the worst my yard has looked in the 12 years I've lived here."
1,Buyer Beware this is a Re-issue,"Unfortunately, Gaiam is at it again with reissuing dvds under a different name. This is the same workout as her Aim True Yoga release. It is a great yoga workout, much more advanced then other yoga videos out there, but receiving from another another vendor, I was highly disappointed that it was a workout I already owned. If you do not have Aim True, I would recommend it if you like a yoga challenge that focuses on strength, balance, and flexibility."
1,Really?,Is it Gaiam that's at fault or Kathryn herself? It would seem to me that this product could not be reproduced without her approval but yep it's a repeat of Aim True. I liked Aim True and recommend it for anyone who wants to challenge themselves to go further. I don't recommend it or this DVD for anyone who gets that yoga is a balance of pushing to your comfort point and perhaps a bit beyond but not to the point of pretending to be a yoga practitioner for 20 years.
1,Ditto...,"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this is simply Budig's Aim True DVD with a different cover. Shameful trickery by Gaiam."
1,Do not buy if you own Aim True Yoga!,"I pre-ordered this DVD because I really liked Aim True Yoga, only to have it arrive, and as the other reviewers stated, it's the same DVD! Definitely very disappointing!"
5,peter and paul,this is a fantastic movie its one you will watch over and over its like having the book of acts open to you to watch and grab your bible and read and re read
2,Peter and Paul DVD,"My husband and I were not especially impressed by the performance of Anthony Hopkins. I felt he spoke too fast and did not do our scriptures justice in his portrayal. The film itself was good, as difficult as it would be to include the entire Book of Acts into 2 hrs. It's worth a look see, although it is by far NOT the greatest Biblical movie out there."
5,Peter and Paul,I am very pleased with my purchase. It was sent very quickly and in great condition. I will buy from this company again.
4,Good buy,"Minor inaccuracies, but over all a good buy. Acting seemed fair but a little too ""western"" at the same time."
1,Poorly made,I stopped watching this movie after 15 min. All they do is argue & yell at one another. Apostles back days were filled with the Holy Spirit not filled with anger & range as portraied in this movie. Poorly made! I don't recommend getting this version.
1,Inaccurate,"This move was a failure. It nowhere near follows the Bible at all. This is pure blasphemy rolled up into a DVD. Not only is it blasphemy, but the acting could be done better by a group of children.Do not buy this. Was a waste of my time and money."
2,Great Story,"It is a great story, it was shipped quickly, but the dvd skips. That was very disapointing."
1,DVD doesn''t work,"It's the second time I buy this DVD and for the second time it doesn't work. The whole DVD has problems, the scenes jump and jump and jump, one can't see the story of Peter and Paul. The first one I tried to fix and screwed it up this time I didn't even bother.The worst of it all is that I really wanted to see this series because it has great actors, and I couldn't BECAUSE THE DVD DOESN'T WORK."
1,Never received the items,I ordered this item 14 Decemeber 2002 and has yet to receive it. so honestly I don't have an review. Trying to contact the seller has been unsuccessful and a maze
5,A must have!,"I've watched this about 4 times now, and each time I get a new insight into the early days of the church. The acting is superb! I knew St. Paul was a driving force in the early church, but I never realized just how strong he was. I highly recommend this to anyone with the slightest interest in watching the early church grow from only the original 12.nancy"
5,Riveting,"The writing is so accurate, if you are familiar with the scriptures you can locate them and actually read along. Anthony Hopkins is outstanding! The personalities of the characters Paul, Peter, John, even Ceasar are well accomplished. I am addicted to this movie! The only downside might be that once you watch it, you will always picture Anthony Hopkins as Paul. This young Anthony Hopkins is so dashing, and convincing, you probably won't mind!You will be blessed by this remarkable portrayal of the early church. I believe you will have a whole new perspective and appreciation for what these men endured and how we too as Christians are asked to endure."
3,Very good film for the protestant side,"The film portrays Peter and Paul very well, its nice to see Gamaliel also included. As for being accurate to the scriptures i only found a few problems. Paul never disagreed with the Jerusalem Council, yet in the film he screams at the council's decision for gentile believers which is not in Acts. Paul never used the phrase ""Faith Alone"" in the bible, yet Barnabas and the Jerusalem jewish christians accuse Paul of saying this is the gospel he preaches. Other than that i truly enjoyed this film more than the cheesy Visual bible ACTS or TBN's redition of Paul. Catholics might also find the faith alone phrase objectionable."
5,"I'd rate this movie with 10 stars, if I could have!!!!!!!!","Ok, so I happen to REALLY like Anthony Hopkins, but that aside, this movie left an impression on me that I simply cannot describe. Anyone who believes they are saved by grace, can relate to this, the GREATEST story ever told about God's transformation of a sinner turned child of God.It's biblically accurate, the acting is superb and all I can say is that I've been looking for this movie locally, for a couple of years, now... I've pre-ordered it, trying to find a good used copy.Yes, I think it's a great movie, but I'm frugal, too. With today's video prices average NEW, at about (...), I cannot see paying (...) for ANY movie...Find this movie, and add it to your church library. It's top notch!!!"
4,Good,"I found Anthony Hopkins interpretation and the directing quite compelling. Also, nice production values. However, I found the wrting wanting. We learn very little of the inner life of Paul, of his relationship with Jesus, and of his compelling need to spread the ""good news"" everywhere. It's all very external--he does this and he does that. But the spiritual force and the realizations that drive him are omitted. Also, his transformation from Christian hater to Christian lover is too abrupt. I wanted to to see a believable gradual transformation that is deeply rooted in love for God--from doubt to uncertainty to understanding to belief to conviction to faith to self-sacrifice and final martydom. The character of Peter is one note--self-guilt, self-dissatisfaction, and self-abasement. I wanted to see a more well-rounded Peter--with some indications of hope, strength, love, and even joy (from just his rememberances of his days with Jesus)."
2,Really?,"Really expected much more than women don't always work nice with women. There were no in depth stories, no solutions....It wasn't nearly as helpful as I had hoped."
4,Personal experiences of the Civil War,"""I'm Surrounded by Methodists..."" is based upon the diary of Chaplain John Stuckenburg of the 145th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. Gives a first-hand account of his experiences of the Civil War as he marched with the troops through each battle. Book also serves as the only regimental history ever written of the 145th, since no official records were ever composed."
3,Beginners need additional navigator,"If you are a beginner Buddhist,as I am, this text comes alive with a teacher's 'live' commentary. Author does provide commentary in the book. Nonetheless, an additional interpretation and explanation gives the reader a better understanding of Mahayana. That said, the text is important,delivering a foundation for further studies. Not easy, leisurely quick reading on the subject by any means. You know you're reading something important and revered and cannot rush. It is a meditation to hold in your hand.For long-time practitioners, I bow."
2,"Sounds like scores from a football game, but it's an Italian western.","I got this film for one reason. Jenny Agutter is one of the most beautiful women in the world. Anyone who disagrees should go back and see LOGAN'S RUN. Unfortunately Jenny has very little to do in this movie except look pretty, but even her great beauty if concealed most of the time.As Italian westerns go, I suppose it is passable, but without Clint Eastwood in it, who cares. There are many westerns, even Italian westerns, that are much better. Unless you are as big a fan of Agutter as I am, chose SILVARARO or some other much better western. Or better still see Jenny Agutter in WALKABOUT or EQUUS or AMY. All of those films are better than this one."
3,China 9 Liberty 37,"This is an interesting old west story mixed with a love story. The film quality isn't the best, but it is typical of the era in which it was produced."
1,Caveat Emptor,"""Caveat emptor"" means ""Let the buyer beware."" Please beware of the following before purchasing the Reel Classic Films release of CHINA 9 LIBERTY 37. It is a DVD-R. It is a cut version. It looks like the worst VHS dupe ever made. The video is distorted. The audio is distorted. If it were sold at $0.01, it would be overpriced. I purchsed it in the hope of some small improvement over the other versions on the market; I watched it with mounting rage at the gall of offering such a travesty for sale. Stay far away from this one."
1,china 9 liberty 37,"Terrible, horrible, I may need a thesaurus to adequately describe how truly awful this copy is. There is no menu, no chapters, the sound and picture quality are extremely poor. The picture jumps and skips. I threw mine away after one viewing."
1,Too much time chopped out.,The Leonard Maltin guide lists this film as being 102 minutes run time and all the dvd versions listed on Amazon appear to be much less...the longest one is 92 min and one is only 78 min with one other being 82 minutes. This is a terrible rip-off of the buying public and a disgrace to the film industry in general. Try to always avoid buying films that have been cut so badly.
1,China 9 Liberty 37,"Hate to say it, Amazon, your stuff is usually pretty good but this is the same old heavily cut version, poor quality,from some tired old VHS version, 4:3. I have a better version recorded from TV years ago, still 4:3, but apparently intact. THe cover art has nothing to do with the film. When will someone release the uncut widescreen version? Rating no stars. Had to put one in to submit this."
2,"I could empathize with Mike, but I found I just couldn't care for her.","This was just ok. I found myself struggling to get through it. I think I just never really warmed up to the characters. I hated Xanadu from the beginning, and part of me couldn't stand Mike for being so stupid about her. I could empathize with Mike, but I found I just couldn't care for her. But the plot was interesting, the small town had character and the issues, of death, responsibility, sexuality and personal identity were well done. I think after reading this I like the Order the Poison Oak better, even though this was superior writing, the characters were far more interesting in the Order of the Poison Oak."
4,Really enjoyed it!,"Really enjoyed this Gay YA book even though it had one of the factors I was trying to avoid reading in lesbian fiction: the not exactly happy, happy ending. I will say that I was actually glad the happy ending was an empowering one for the heroine and made me love Mike even more! This is one book I will encourage my daughter to read."
3,Far From Xanadu,"Mike Szabo lives in small town Coalton. Life isn't great. Mike's father killed himself a few years ago, and Mike's mother is an obese shut-in. Still, Mike has a life and a routine, meeting Jamie at the Dairy Delite for Mistees and playing softball. That is, until troubled and beautiful Xanadu moves to town and turns everything upside down.She befriends Mike and Jamie, the only two gay teenagers in the small town and the three become close....that is until Mike's growing feelings for Xanadu are unrequited and the three cannot go on just being friends.This is a story of growing up differently from everyone else (financially and emotionally) and Mike's stuggles to belong, especially given the lack of parental support. I could feel for Mike, Xanadu, and Jamie, but found I could not support all of their decisions or the way they chose to deal with situations. A fairly entertaining, quick read."
3,ultimately the friend's story was more interesting to me,"There are a few too many convenient aspects to the plot, but overall a well done story of coming to terms with sexual identity, first love and (predictable) heartbreak. I found the character of Xanadu to be rather annoying and flat. I felt mild emotional engagement with Mike's plight & story; however, halfway through the story I was truthfully much more interested in her friendship with Jamie, and Jamie's story.The book may have been Mike's story but by the last page I was wishing for Jamie's story, wishing that there was a book about his journey and what happens after his ""moment"" in this book."
3,It was okay.....,"I found this book to be an interesting read. I liked the character of Mike, even though I can't exactly emphasize with the ""buff"" side of her. I hated the character of Xanadu. The plot was somewhat predictable but nonetheless, I still continued to read the book.I would not exactly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read a story about first love, teen lesbians, small town drama, etc. But, if you're bored on a summer day and have nothing else to do, then sure, go for it."
4,I liked it,"I've been a Los Lobos fan for some time and this DVD of their concert did not disappoint. I enjoyed the ""extra"" background goodies too."
1,could do better,"I read some reviews saying recording quality was average, but the whole performance was not exciting. I love Los Lobos and I think this must be one of their most uninteresting performances. To release it is sheer suicide. I was hoping for much more traditional influenced guitar playing and lively atmosphere. To skimp on the budget with sound quality really ruins a recording. Sorry guys :("
3,Screen format?,"This sounds like a red-hot disc, but can anyone tell me whether or not the DVD is widescreen format or full frame?"
3,Could be a lot better,"I'm a longtime fan of Los Lobos and this DVD definitely captures the spirit of their live performance. That said, other reviewers who are fans have apparently been so pleased that there is a Los Lobos DVD that they have overlooked or glossed over a couple of negatives: 1) the sound simply isn't that great. Really good concert DVDs take the sound directly off the mixer and use some separate microphone inputs for ambience and crowds sounds. The sound on this DVD lacks depth and dimensionality suggesting either an inferior mixer or some other approach to the recording. 2) the vocals are not always ""spot on"" in terms of being on key. The cost of the DVD is relatively low and in a sense, you are getting what you paid for. Dedicated fans will want to own the DV but Los Lobos' CDs are a better way to introduce people to the creative music and sounds of an eclectic and talented group."
2,Diablotek ATI Rage XL 8 MB PCI Video Card,"If you need a cheap video card, this one will work fine. Keep in mind it's not designed to work with Windows 7, but it does, so long as you allow Windows 7 to install it's own drivers. DO NOT use the attached Driver CD. It worked fine on my Dell Dimension 3000 but only had two video resolutions available, 1024x768 and 600x800. If that's all you need this card will work out ok. If you need greater resolutions than this, buy a better card. My other Dell 3000 has a NVDIA PCI card and it's 100% better but costs considerably more. Good luck."
3,"Good product, not for LCD monitors","The product works, but as I expected (PCI slot) are out of date, so do not buy if you want to connect a second display to your Windows 7 system.It has limited screen resolutions. My computer has a cheap motherboard and only supports PCI slots."
3,"Cute, but leaves a little to be desired!","Just got these in the mail the other day. I immediately went out and put them in my car. Unfortunately, the closing hooks/elastics, did not work like they suggested in the diagram. Maybe my seat bottom was too big? But I had to get a tad bit creative when it came to attaching them to my seat.Otherwise, the design is super cute and I love the little emblem at the bottom right part of the seat. They're a little bit thin, but they're not terrible.I still like them and I don't regret buying them, but I did have some small problems!For the money, I'm happy with them!"
5,Great for Brad Pitt fans,"If you love Brad Pitt, you will like this book. I just wish a book would come out that is current."
1,Keep shopping,"While this toy is fun at first, watch out. I bought a total of 3 of these super stompers and after the 1st or 2nd run, they broke. Hot Wheels was great about the warranty, but this particular toy is not very durable."
4,Fun game!,This is a fun game for kids and family. Some of the questions are kind of difficult for an 8 year old though. Make sure they know their trivia.
5,Great for family fun night!!!!,"This game is fun for everyone. It's not too easy for adults or too hard for kids. There's a good balance to keep all of us entertained. My kids are 9 and 6 and they are quite successful with this game. It has been a great way to pull the family together for some good ""old fashioned"" fun."
3,A Fun Game with Limitations,"I bought this game for my 9 year old daughter. It was easy to play and we had a lot of fun playing it. Some of the questions were about movies that I would not allow my daughter to watch yet but since my daughter is on the lower end of the age range, that is probably ok. My biggest issue with the game however is that some of the questions were about movies or TV shows that she could not possibly have known about. For example, there was a question about a little known movie that came out in 1999. Well, in 1999 my daughter was 3 and this is a movie rated PG-13. The positive in this is that there were questions that were good for kids and for adults and since we were playing with her, it did keep our interest going.This is defnitely a game for a family that stays in tune to pop culture. There were definitely questions that were probably considered easy that we missed since we don't watch that much TV. Overall though, it was a fun game."
3,"it's a good concept, but.....","This is the first ""scene it"" we have played and the two things I don't like about it are, first, they replay the same questions. The first time we played was fun although it only took fifteen minuets for some one to win, but the second time we played they showed a lot of the same questions. There is no way to get it to play questions you have not done yet. so you have to skip to find some, that gets old!The second thing I don't like is that they say it is for 8 years old and up, but my kids are 8 and 12 and they could not answer even half the questions. It is more for 14 and up. Kids who are into pop culture. My kids don't know who Britny Spears is, and I don't want them to. And I don't let them watch ""That 70's Show""."
2,"Brag, Brag, Brag","Buy this cd only if you want to hear Will bragging for three minutes. He is being such a hypocrite in this song and even though (I think) he's trying to be positive, it just doesn't work. I love Will, but this song has got to go."
2,didnt really work for me.,"supposedly it is supposed too help with arthritis relief, but it really didn't add much in terms of relief, also doesn't include instructions in terms of dosage and use."
2,No as I expected.,"Did not work at all, as per directions of the manufacture. but need a better brand same symtoms to help ."
5,What a Great product!!!,This stuff works!!!there's nothing you can buy without a script that will work better!you can't beat the price either.enjoy lasting relief
2,Didn't do much for me,"It's an odor free skin cream but had no effect on my shoulder pain.The cream is quite greasy until absorbed. It's hard to wipe off of your hands so greasiness remains, making it difficult to tighten the lid. If it was a lot less expensive and came in a dispenser container I might consider it for use as a face/body cream."
5,Great Product!,"My wife has arthritis in both knees and is anticipating total replacement within the next year or so. She's been using Blue-Emu for the last couple of years and finds that it's the only product that she's tried that relieves the pain, but doesn't smell like a nursing home! In fact, there's no odor at all! I've tried it on my sore shoulders after an active afternoon raking leaves and can attest to it's effectiveness. Order at least two 4 oz jars @ 14.31 for free shipping and still save more over buying it at Walgreen's where it's usually 16.99 a jar."
4,not too greasy,I have used emu oil based products before and thought I would try this one. I bought this to help with pain in leg/hip after hip surgery. Goes on easy enough without too much residue on hands. Seems to work ok. Part of me wonders if the act of massaging it into muscles is more beneficial than the product itself ....?
3,"Men,Movies and Carol","Certainly not one of Ms. Burnett's shining hours on television, this special made me realize how old fashioned sketch comedy seems in today's rapid fire, ""joke"" heavy sitcoms. Sadly, character driven, revue material seems to have gone the way of The Ford Pinto. Unfortunately, that is the type of comedy Carol is best known. While she can still get big laughs with her impeccable turn of phrase or one of those classic takes, the sketches were thin. Her troupe of gentleman guest stars pefomed dutifully and proved to be quite deft with this silly stuff. Nicest moment was Burnett and guest Tony Bennett's cozy duet. An utterly nonsensical ""musical"" finale was the final straw for someone who prefers Burnett with material better suited to her genius. Surely, some of Burnett's old writers must have cringed, uttering ""You cant go home again."""
5,Readable--fun--pathbreaking,"Enstad takes U.S. women's history in important new directions because she understands how young working-class women created their own class-conscious identity in terms made available by consumer culture. In this context hats, shoes and pulp-fiction gave working-class women fun, spunky ways to of asserting themselves and their interests. Alas, at the time, neither male union activists nor middle-class women allies understood these young girls' politics, and the union movement suffered for its misunderstanding. But Enstad understands these girls perfectly. In Enstad's analysis movies and fashion become political--as they in fact were. And thanks to her explanation I finally understand why my feisty Jewish grandmothers insisted on calling themselves and their friends ""ladies."" A must-read for anybody who loves the new women's history."
2,Missing vital components,"As a new subscriber to the organic food movement but needing more information on it, I bought this book because I thought it would by my primary ""source"" on it. Wrong. I expected page after page of sound and detailed arguments where the author would SHOW the reader the benefits of organic food. Instead what I got was 4 page chapters where the author only tells the reader why it's better, and does so with minimal evidence. It goes into way too much detail on the legal and commercial history of the movement leaving out a thorough analysis and comparison of the real value of organic food, that it's not processed like conventional food is. Showing this process through illustrative righting and contrasting with organic food, perhaps doing a commidity chain analysis on several food items, needs to be the centerpiece of such a book and it is simply missing. For those more interested in the evolution of organic food and looking for contemporary resources on it, this is their book."
3,Need instructions in English please,"This game is perfect for the 3 yr old I Nanny, however the instructions are not in English so I have to make my own way of doing this. Is there any way to gain the instructions in English???????"
3,Lots of Info but Disapointing,"This book covers a lot of territory in the history of mathematics, which does a lot to show how various topics developed over time. My biggest beef is that throughout he keeps saying to read other books for details. Since one has to eat and sleep it's all but impossible to follow up on these suggestions."
5,A rich feast of materials,"P. M. H. Atwater presents a very rich feast of materials on NDEs of children and how these transformed their lives.She defines four types of experiences, finding that the distribution of each of these reported by children differs from the distribution reported by adults. :1. An ""initial"" or ""nonexperience,"" of ""loving nothingness;""2. Unpleasant or hell-like experience;3. Pleasant, or heaven-like experience; and4. Transcendent experience.Significant numbers of Atwater's reporters had multiple NDEs, each adding its transformative influence to their lives.This is a book that is worth a slow and thoughtful read, presenting a wealth of observations and thought-provoking explanations of the worlds beyond physical existence."
2,bengali dictionary,The book is poorly bound and much too big to handle the number of pages it contains. With frequent use the pages would definately become loose. I feel that the dictionary would best be in 2 volumes to elimate this problem. I returned the book and got a refund.
4,Worship Jamz Review,I give this product a thumbs up for the following reasons:1. Very good quality2. Well Organized3. Nice music choice4. good job of advertisingI give this product a thumbs down for the following reasons:1. Price; [...]2.more creative on color on your page for the product
2,soler moler,"I,at first, thought that the soler moler was chasing the moles away. Found out a short time later that they were digging a tunnel from the soler moler. It,apparently, hasn't scared them at all."
3,changing battery,"This solar mole chaser works okay, but I find no instructions about how to replace the battery. Can someone advise me?"
1,"Moles 1, Solar Moler 0","I bought this partly out of desperation and partly because of the excellent reviews. Sadly, it has proven a dissapointment. Maybe I just have some sort of evil uber-moles in my yard, but they were utterly unphased by the Soler Moler. In fact, they built a mole hill right around it, as if to say ""We scoff at your puny solar moler technology! In fact we are not even mildly annoyed... only amused at your act of desperation. WaHAHAHAHAHAHA! Now take it away or we shall taunt you a second time."""
4,Bye-bye moles!,"I have this thing in the ground for about a month, and I haven't seen any moles or their mounds during that time. The product is well constructed and easy to get up and running. Being this time of year in the Pacific Northwest, it was hard to get two sunny days to allow the battery to charge up. Two partly cloudy days worked. It's in the ground, and I don't even have to think about it. I occasionally hear the noise it makes every 30 seconds, but it blends in well with its surroundings. I have a large yard, and this thing says its good for 7000 square feet. However, if a second one is necessary, I won't hesitate to buy another one."
1,What a lie! Solar Moler did NOT work.,"Well, I bought 3 of these solar molers, thinking that they would work based on people's reviews here. I followed the instructions, recharged them as directed, but I still have tunnels in my yard!***THEY DON'T WORK!!***If any of u r consider buying it, don't bother! It's been almost 3 months & I have tunnels RIGHT NEXT to Solar Molers! Disappointing & I'm returning mine! I'll lose the $9.99 shipping fee, sucks!"
2,Solar Moler,"After I had two of the Solar Molers in my garden for over a week, it appeared that there was still considerable mole activity. There were furrows right next to one of the devices.I have sent both units back,which was easy to do, and expect to get a credit on my card. I am very happy with the vendor since they have guaranteed my satisfaction."
5,Superb performance,"A sophisticated meeting of East and West through the universal language of music. Using traditional Chinese instruments, the young ladies entertain us with a wide repertoire of Chinese folk music, jazz, pop and Western classical masterpieces with charm, elegance, and good communication with the audience. They perform without a conductor, without sheet music, and not even looking at each other; yet, the coordination and timing are superb. The spectacular skyline of Shanghai at night is the proper backdrop for this extraordinary concert. A sustained, thunderous applause and enthusiastic shouts of BRAVO!!!"
5,Magical,"This is a wonderful, exuberant performance, full of joy and artistry. 12 Girls Band make their instruments dance, sing and rejoice in their music. Their celebration of traditional Chinese instruments through the fusion of the traditional and the contemporary breathes pure magic into the entire concert. One cannot help but be swept up in the majesty and beauty of the music created by these extraordinarily talented ladies. This is music to touch the soul."
5,Sam's review,"I have known of the Twelve Girl Band before they came to the states, I enjoyed the music that they played then and now that I have it on CD I am looking forward to more their newest release. I am sure that any music lover would also enjoy leasoning to the music of the Twelve Girl Band."
5,The Pirate And His Lady is Amazing!,"Emerald Harwick finds herself in danger on the high seas. In the midst of war on the Jamaican seas, she finds her Christian Faith and loyalty are tested to the limit. Pirates, Buccaneers and Rulers of the world are beautifully intertwined in this story of danger, love, and the search for truth.There are few good, Christian authors around, But Linda Chaikin would be one of those few. This book was simply heartstopping! i cried, i laughed, and even got frustrated!But in the end, it leaves you so happy you feel you could cry. That's how a book should leave you. She tells it like you're actually there, watching the story play before your eyes."
3,Good.. For A Year...,"Worked well for a year, then failed. Was well kept & still looks good, just does not function any longer."
1,Comet 103 HPQ,This clutch will NOT fit a 2003/2004 Kawasaki Prairie 360 4x4 ATV. It is too wide and rubs on the engine casing. I had to return it.
1,It's not water-proof!!!,"SentrySafe 1170 is NOT water proof at all. Just had a little water incident in the room where my SentrySafe sits. Two days later, when I opened the box, to my big surprise, all papers were soaked in water. You can imagine, I'm so disappointed.Don't buy SentrySafe 1170."
1,DO NOT USE FOR MEDIA STORAGE,"I ordered this safe because it said it was safe for CD's and DVD's. When it arrived, I did not even open the box. On the outside of the box, the very first line said it was NOT TO BE USED FOR THE STORAGE OF CD'S OR DVD'S! For such items, the box said to look at Sentry fire safe media products. I immediately contacted Amazon, and to them I would give 5 stars. I got prompt satisfaction from them for this item's return. (Gave it back to UPS the next day, free shipping.) And they arranged for my credit just as fast. I could not be happier with Amazon's service. However, I encouraged them to change the description on this web page so no one else is deceived as I was. Hopefully that is done soon, but I am writing this review just in case. I am now searching once again for a fire safe box for my CD's, and am a little hesitant to make a purchase based on the web page information."
2,Fire safe = yes . . . theft safe = no,"I own this safe. I misplaced the keys. It took me 30 seconds with a reciprocating saw to open it. The lock bar is made of stamped steel. It cut like butter. If you are looking for theft security, spend the money to get a better safe"
1,Unhappy with Damaged Units,Purchased 6 safes for client gifts. We delivered them over a two month period. 2 of the 6 were damaged in the carton due to poor packing of the keys and unsecured doors - a little tape and bubble wrap of the keys and security of the doors would have worked. Damage on the last 2 was not discovered until we were ready to give to the clients. Amazon says return window expired. Very unhappy with Amazon and manufacturer for their packing of the units in a shoddy way.Planned on buying more for gift - another 6 at this time - but will shift to Walmart - same price and better return policy and also free shipping.
4,Strong and sturdy Fire Safe,"I've had this fire safe for over 10 years now and am very happy with its quality. I am concerned after reading these reviews that it is not fire ""proof"", but fire ""resistant"". I am hoping that if it is ever exposed to fire, it would stand up to the heat! I'd love to hear from any person who had the unfortunate experience of having the fire safe tested in an actual fire.As for other's comments of it not being ""theft proof"". This is not the kind of safe that you use to protect yourself from burglaries. Thank goodness that it isn't theft proof, because if it is locked and in a fire, I would like to know that I can get into the box to access my belongings.I'm only giving it 4 stars because I have no idea on whether it will stand up in a fire."
1,Wouldn't buy,As others state this is of limited use ... I have much better whippet books on my shelves.
3,Entertaining but uneven collection of sportswomen's quotes,"A nice collection of quotations as befits the title, though some strange choices. Tennis is heavily represented, perhaps as the most successful women's sport as far as catching the public eye. I still don't think Anna Kournikova merits the dozen or so quotes that she's given, and Jay seems to have an obsession about the Bobby Riggs-Billy Jean King match. I never thought it was that big a deal, though I could be wrong.There are a handful of soccer quotes, though the ones from Mia are not her best. Still an interesting collection, though.Perhaps my favorite: ""We're women who like to knock people's heads off and then put on a skirt and go dancing."" - Brandi Chastain."
2,Complicated,"This book is hard to understand. It gives charts and formulas for sizing patterns for knitting, both hand and machine. It appears to be complete and written for the more savy craftsperson. That is not me!Diana"
3,Short but Sweet,"You don't have to be Lutheran to appreciate some of the wonderful text in this tiny little book. Read it in an hour or two but then come back to all the dog-eared and underlined passages again and again. He has some cautionary remarks-""I suspect, lifestyle rather than religion is the organizing principle of most lives. They are not 'rooted in the gospel'; they are rooted in a social class or a lifestyle, and the gospel is an ornament they wear, like a gold cross around their neck""--but he also encourages: ""Sharing the good news about Jesus is not a process of pouring my great faith into my faith-poor neighbor but rather discovering that my imperfect faith can be used by God in a way that will surprise me."" Only 4 stars instead of 5, because I'd like to see a book like this, with study questions for small groups, include more biblical references to ponder in relation to his good thoughts."
2,This version of movie has been cut,"I first rented this movie from Netflix and loved it so bought. This 96 minute version is the newer one and has one of the best scenes cut. The editing is not as good as you find in most youtube videos, but I loved the movie so much I went hunting for the older 93 minute version. Finally found it and if you go looking the cover it NOT this cover. It is the one with 3 scenes on it, not this one with 4. It is well worth the hunt if you enjoyed this movie as much as I do. Ian Somerhalder is excellent in it, in fact the whole cast is great, but Ian is the reason I rented it in the first place."
5,Full Featured All Region DVD! Artistic and Beautiful Movie!,"Wow! Finally an all region DVD with a behind the scenes documentary, interviews with the cast and crew, featuring Faye Dunaway, Laren Holly, and others; 30 minutes of deleted scenes, an outake reel, the theatrical trailer, and 2 complete documentaries; ""One Woman's Story"", & ""A Positive Image"". As for the movie: Director Martin Guigui portrays a ""Robert Altman"" like world of eccentric and soulful behavior, by tastefully utilizing the inevitable pains of facing cancer head on and opening a window full of hope and desire to live each day to the fullest. Edie McClurg is wonderful in her portrayal of the kind hearted Nurse with perpetual intent to help her patients to no avail. The characters of the Baptist women, led by veteran actress Janet Carol, serve up great comic relief. Cool cameos by musicians Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs and Rita Coolidge. Artistic cinematography. This is simply a beautiful film."
4,great movie,Disorder 3 is one of the best mtn bike movies i have see it has single track huge drops huge jumps and awsome music
3,K.O.B.E.,"I am very proud that Kobe Bryant now has a music career. The 1st song sounds great however, I think Kobe needs to work on his rapping. I belive Kobe shows promissing talent and all of the possibilities of being a great superstar in music like in the NBA.P.S. That Tyra Banks was a great choice for appearing in his first single. I did not know she could sing."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I loved this single, K.O.B.E. , good job Kobe, hearing him perform live at All Star Weekend was even better!"
2,ill give him 2,"he deserved a 1, but he gets a two, cause i saw him guard my favorite player allen iverson and kobe did a good job on him. as for his rap game, its just corney!"
4,Tucson for the visitor,"I was looking for a book that would tell me inside information about restaurants, shopping, art galleries, bicycle trails and side trips for our month long visit next winter. This book dealt with all of those subjects and some extraneous subjects I was not interested in. The chapters were well defined, so finding a particular subject was easy. I would recommend this book to visitors as well as those moving to Tucson."
2,current owner operator,The swisher has a plunger button that needed adjustment before I could start it for first use. The hitch bar is too light grade steel and bent easily. I stiffened it by welding rebar on sides. The holes for drop pins stretched out due to same weak steel. The mower did well but seems to gouge and scalp on hilly terrain if not vigil. Pulls easily behind UATV.
