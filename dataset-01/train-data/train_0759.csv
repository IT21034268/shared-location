3,Certainly not read in a 'blink',"Not nearly as good as the tipping point and a little too 'technical' at some points. It took me almost twice as long to get through this book as it does most books that are of equal size. Nonetheless I still think it was an interesting read, it just would fall lower on my list of things to read over again."
4,Yeah!,"I mean that's it - just ""Yeah!"". There you have a totally-down-with-this-book review - I didn't even think about the book while I read it, I just kind of went, ""Yeah!"" - & I got into it. I've got the power of reading without thinking - having mastered the thinking without thinking part a long time ago - years before this book came out. I don't know what blinking has to do with it at all, though & that's why only four stars. Yeah!"
1,The usual crap you can expect out of Gladwell.,"Had to pick this up for a class, and as with most examples of Gladwell's work, all you get are sloppy examples that may or may not loosely apply to the word he has chosen for a title. All he does is provide shaky examples of what he want's to ""prove"" without giving any kind of nod to a counter example. To make matters worse the topic of the book is a dangerous one for people who believe that Malcom Gladwell has anything good to say. Please, for the sake of mankind do not read this book."
2,Not very useful,This book tells you two points: 1. Blink is possible 2. It takes practice. That's it. I don't think I've learned a lot from this book.
3,The Power of Anecdotes Without Explanations ;),"I'll do what Gladwell suggests inside the first chapters, ""Thin-Slicing,"" where one brings all one's experience and intuition to bear in the first impressions of the book. It's a nice book for the safe discussion of what clever scientific observation would say normally goes on inside our skins. That's it. Unless you're in a field where you want to determine how people make decisions in popular culture, get this book from a lending library and save the shekels. This is a book I've read to find out why it sold well.And I'll offer this: it's a pleasant read with very interesting anecdotes. It could give more courage to your convictions that skill isn't always backed by decades of experience. But this is not a book to provide pointers on how to develop your skills in thinking without thinking. You already know how to do that. Those skills are called intuition and instinct.Maybe I'll change this review after I finish the book ;)"
3,"TRY TO TAKE IT ALL IN, IF YOU CAN","From page one until the end of the afterword, there is onestory after the next, pitting the unconscious versus theconcsious mind in the decision-making proccess. I thoughtit was a tough booK to read aaannnddd understand all of it.The whole face-reading / mind-reading portion was wwaayy over-the-top. I would still like to read """"THE TIPPING POINT"""",though!!"
2,Nothing more than a glimpse.,"This book does nothing more than skims the surface on the subject of snap judgments and general psychology. Gladwell does nothing more than report on the subject matter, offering no depth, no analysis, no digging deeper into associated concepts to help the reader better understand the context and material in the book; not to mention that the more cognitive types will find it - quite literally - an empty read.Read it like a news story if you must, because in my opinion it's just one long-winded, repetitive news article.Cheers."
2,Fluff.....,"An entire book that provides nothing more than a problem with no solution. How this book made it onto the front marketing tables at my bookstore, I have no idea other than Gladwell's hair. It's certainly not his propensity for choosing interesting topics. You could get this information, along with informative insight and possible solutions to the problems he presents, by watching some kid show on PBS. Don't waste your time."
3,Blink - Great concept; Where's the Beef?,"Malcolm Gladwell's obviously done his research. He writes clearly and articulately. But, I found Blink wanting.While the book starts strong, and presents a compelling argument, in my opinion I thought it kind of fizzled out. I would have enjoyed greater substantiation of the Blink theory.But, this is a pop psychology book. I'm sure the author was advised against inundating readers with too many facts. Still, when reading such a work, more supporting facts would have proven beneficial.It's certainly worth reading (and a fast read), but not necessarily justifiable hard cover material."
1,If only it were over in one blink,"Starts off very interesting as if there was some grand scheme that was about to be revealed. However, as the book progressed I was left wondering where all these examples were leading. I finished the book and hadn't learned anything new and was thoroughly disappointed. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"Fun stories, no real point","After reading this book, I'm left with a whole lot of cool little stories, but no real point. What was the thesis? What was the conclusion? I'm still confused.It did hold my attention, though."
2,20 Pages of Content in a 254 Page Book,The two stars are for the interesting subject matter of the book only...the 'adaptive unconscious'. Unfortunately the author is not a subject matter expert. He relates a handful of anecdotes he's obtained from others and tells them over and over throughout the book. This book was in desperate need of another editor. The author should stick to shorter format periodical writing. You won't get anything more out the book than what you can find in the reviews below. Save yourself the money and look for another read.
1,Blink should be renamed STINK!,"A mis-mash of other peoples findings, not even pulled together into a cohesive whole. Thought the book might have some original ideas about how to change our snap judgements - NOT SO."
2,This Book Is a Big Disappointment,"This book starts off well enough. The stuff about Gottman and Eckman was fascinating. Then he gets into the car salesman, and the Warren G. Harding chapter, and the book goes nowhere. By the end of the book, I felt totally ripped off. This was like a short essay expanded into a boring book. If you really want to know about thin-slicing, read Arny Mindell - he can tell you how to do it effectively. Get this book out of the library and read the first sixty to eighty pages. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,"Some interesting points, and a lot of stories...","This book is full of many little stories that augment the author's point that many judgements are made as split second decisions. When I first started it, I was hoping that it would have more of a scientific understanding of how any why this works. After reading it, it seems as though all I've seen is a large collection of examples that support the point that decisions and judgements are made quickly, and that with practice this can be somewhat controlled.Overall, I don't think that it was a bad book; It just feels like there are a lot of examples that work to lead you to your own conclusions. To borrow a theme from the book, ""something just didn't seem that exciting about it, but it is difficult to put it into words."""
4,Foreviewing / Art and Accidence,"Blink is a short and artful compendinum of many known incidents of foretelling in a crisis. There isn't a lot new here but its a well told stringing together incidents resolved by intuition. But intuition is too lax a discription. What, Gladwell really reveals is how bits and pieces of our past exprience come instantly together, a processes suggestive of lens clouded with the detrius of missinformation, but one which still renders the outlines of fact in the blur and hurry of a needed decision. ""Blink"" will be new stuff to many but to those who have been around a whild it is nonetheless a refresher course how decisions are made, often under duress."
5,Fresh,"Is it true a fake can produce intuitive revulsion in the eye of a knowing observer? A blink is a glance, fast and frugal decisionmaking.The truth of a marriage can be understood by an observer in a short time. A relationship between people has a distinctive signature.Free will is an illusion. We can be coached, primed. Gladwell speaks of thin-slicing, the process of making decisions quickly on the basis of very little information. When you start second-guessing you may be undermining yourself. Sometimes extra information just confuses the issue.Thin slicing is recognizing patterns and making snap judgments. It turns out that buying jam is a snap decision. Less choice means more sales. The face is an enormously rich source of emotion. Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts.Music auditions are thin slicing moments. The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.The notes at the end of the book are of great interest."
2,Malcolm in the Middle,"This is Malcolm Gladbag's follow up effort to, ""The Power of Farting without Farting,"" and Bruce Lee's ""The Art of Fighting without Fighting."" I took the quiz at the end of the book and got an A+. Thanks Malcolm!I defy anyone to give me a helpful vote for this review!No takers?...."
3,A Good Book but ...,"Malcolm Gladwell does a good job of introducing and defending decision making based on quick deductions and first impressions. However, I found his examples to be needlessly racially biased--to the point I felt I was in a community college SOC 101 class. It could have been more entertaining, and less preachy."
2,Hyped book that ends up about nothing.,"This book is full of promise and full of interesting stories. But ultimately, it doesn't even end up proving or disproving any of the ideas on its jacket.Some people are good at trusting their instincts, and they end up right. Others are bad at trusting them. Other people's instincts themselves are untrustworthy. Other people don't trust their instincts. Some are right, some are wrong.It's the equivalent of snob candy--it feels like an intellectual book, but it really doesn't say much of anything. It just makes you feel smart for a few minutes, if that.I'd put money that no one will be talking about this book in two years. It's just the flavor of (last) month."
4,Blink is an entertaining book anyone would enjoy!,"Blink ponders the concept of snap decision making utilizing several examples in order to prove its point...Some of the examples begin to be a little redundant, but I do recommend this read"
3,Blink,The book made a decent impression leaving me a few good ideas. It was a very fast read with little left to ruminate upon.
4,Instinct,"I got this as a gift for my husband. He likes listening to the CD's while driving to work. He really liked the information given in the audio book, which is word for word with what the book says."
3,Great inisghts,"Gladwell presents snap decision making and gut instinct well. I think for those that have the ability to evaluate situations quickly either by ""thin slicing"" or just common sense this book will validate that your abilities have merit in the world. Not a book for everyone and those scared to make decisions without all the facts probably will be frightened by it."
1,Thin Slice this!,"Ok so at the end of the book you are given the full belief that what you work out in your mind in the first couple of seconds of any situation you are right and just go with your ""gut"" instinct. Unless of course you are doing the cola challenge or rolling in a car with 3 other cops and are carrying weapons.The book is nice fast read but is hard to use for any practical application."
2,Poor Examples,"I too decided to read the book due to hype and enjoyed the beginning of the book. I soon found myself skimming forward due to the meaningless examples, military, doctors, etc. Please, we all know that data can be 'sliced' and manipulated to prove anything, even opposing viewpoints so why the long self-serving studies. I don't disagree that certain subconscience responses can guide our actions and views, tell me how to tap into that. Tell me more practical applications and everyday life situations. I found the book to be 25% value and 75% filler."
3,Glad I read it,"Very insightful. I talked a lot about this book and the new ideas it gave me when I read it. I dont know if I buy into every point made within the book, but I defenitly enjoyed learning the new ideas, and even though I read it two years ago, some of the ideas I got from it come back to me and help me understand the split decisions I make."
3,Interesting,"Easy to read book, that is very entertaining and Fun. I am always amazed at Gladwell and his ability to tell a storyI have found as I went through the book more and more ""blink"" like circumstances that other people have exhibited (e.g. picking a restaurant) that has been very interesting"
4,useful,This is a very useful and well written book. I could use many ideas for my job so far. I guess I will reread the book many times.
4,Very Interesting Read,I love Malcolm Gladwell. He takes a unique approach to analyzing cultural phenomena as it relates to the world or buisness and management. You can learn from this book.
4,thin-slice this,"While not science, this book is thought provoking, interesting, and fun to read. The writing is proficient, the subject is intriguing, and the author offers advice when to trust a snap judgment, and when not to trust it. Good book."
4,A Great Oh Yeah book!!,This book is a real eye opener. It isn't quite like a how to book as the sub title suggests. It is more of a book that explains the brain works. The title suggests is is about how to think. It really focuses on how the brain makes decisions.The points are very interesting but nothing revolutionary. He goes back several times to the point how the brain needs just enough information. To much information overloads the brains and slows the process. These principles are things you already know and experience but didn't quite realize. After reading the book you will find out why those things happen. Through reading the book your mind will start to work. I am sure the average person will think of things where they could apply the principles. I am sure some people will reap huge rewards from the principles in the book. Most will just be enlightened. Overall it is a real good read.
4,Very interesting to read but not life changing,"This is one of a number of recent books that could be subtitled ""Aren't Humans Quirky?"".You will learn a great deal about how your preception works, often in counter-intuitive ways.It is a light read that will both entertain and educate you. You may come away with the tendency to make less assumptions about your experiences and the need to pay much close attention to what is going on around you and how you preceive it."
5,Trust Your Intuition,"Blink was fast and fascinating reading. The idea that subconscious mind constantly churns in the background, only to reveal its accurate conclusions as feelings and intuition makes a great foundation for this book. The author's insight and logic add great value to the well-researched facts.I found it to be profound and thought provoking. I am learning to trust my intuition."
4,A good read,Blink kept me engaged in its stories and got me thinking about things I never gave much thought. I also went to a web site that he had mentioned and it actually worked! I recommend it especially to anybody who's job requires them to make split second decisions.
1,Readable and informative,"A great read for those of you surrounded by button-down type A's that have to dissect every problem and beat it to death before they can take action. Buy one for each of them, and give them ten dollars if they will read it!If you find yourself in meetings, or calling meetings to decide on the problem solving method to tackle the problem of Coke or Pepsi in your vending machine at work, you need this book."
1,Questionable Judgement is a Theme for Gladwell,"Having read recent articles written by Gladwell in the New Yorker, and having offered him the courtesy of access to information for the purposes of more objective reporting, and yet never hearing from him, it strikes me that the content of anything written by the author has to be taken as ""for comedic purposes only"". How anyone can consider Gladwell a serious author or innovative thought leader needs to complete more detailed research in to his writing. Blink proves to be ample additional proof that in future generations, when school children are reviewing the work of early 21st century writers, Gladwell's work will be used as an example of what NOT to aspire to..."
3,Its just Okay,I am currently reading this book and surprisingly I havent finished it yet. To me its a very slow read. I usually will pick up a book and have a hard time putting it down. The stories are pretty interesting for the most part but its not enough to get me excited. So far I haven't learned anything that wow's me. (although i'm only half way thru it). I'm hoping it'll pick up the pace as I keep reading.
3,undecided,Gladwell has done what the rest of us did not think of doing - thats his 'tipping point' - he states the obvious. Everything in this book is basically stating the obvious. It is not new - just taking the pbvious and writing it up in a really nice way. Would I recommend it? - NOT REALLY
2,Meh.,"The first half of the book was definately worth the read and i would suggest you buy it just for the ladder half, however about halfway through he gets entirely off subject and starts talking about Coke-cola and Pepsi in taste tests vs entire drink tests etc... How things are advertised etc...I can see how it fits into the subject, about Thin slicing, but he got so far off subject that i was no longer able to hold an interest in the book and stopped about 3/4 the way through.The first half of the book talks about Thin slicing; the process in which your mind relates the information it is receiving to past events in order to gain an understanding of it. He gives numerous examples of this and it is rich in detail. Definately a good read until he gets off subject. Two stars."
5,Good to know,Isn't it good to know about the things we know but don't realize how we know them? This book will give you insight on your reactions and some situations where we are not making good decisions. Fast and enjoyable read.
2,"little book, why are you so little?","I had the original paperback version of this book, and gave it away to a friend.When I ordered another from Amazon, they sent me a 25% smaller version of my book.It didn't say anything about shrinking the book before they sent it to me.I'm a big man.I like big books.All the words were there .... I just wish they would have been their original size."
4,Good book,"This book is written in a great way. It keeps you turning the pages until the last page. However as the author is journalist and not a psychologist, folks who expected a technical book might be disappointed. Nevertheless a great read for an everyday person."
3,Too much thinking & information makes for bad decisions,"Malcolm Gladwell seems to have made a career out of writing one-idea books and turning them into bestsellers! I liked this one better than the Tipping Point (some ideas have ""stickiness but we don't really know why) and Outliers (It takes ten thousand hours to become expert at something- perspiration instead of inspiration)Having said all that, Gladwell writes very well. It's smooth ride from start to finish and there are some moments that will yield genuine surprise. These books read like some sort of dissertation, a hypothesis with supporting arguments. But you always feel that the question was decided at the outset and Gladwell doesn't present or deal with much information to contradict his hypothesis. In that sense, perhaps it is (as one reviewed remarked) one part ""junk science"""
1,*CLICK* The power to go back on your browser and forget,"about buying this book.What a load of garbage. This book, as some other reviewers have astutely pointed out, is a total waste of time. It simply serves to illustrate the point that anyone can and will do anything, find any niche, to make a buck. A complete travesty of time, energy and money. Avoid. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Enough cliches? Well, the bottom line is that they are all true. There really is nothing worthwhile offered by this author, and, by the end of this book, you are truly left feeling had. This author should stick to writing short articles for The New Yorker. That, if anything, is all he is truly suited for in terms of writing.Stick with what your gut is telling you about this book - it's b.s. Good call."
1,Left confused.,"Blink, is predominately a collection of outcomes from previous research on unconscious thinking. In the first half of the book, the author tries to categorize rapid, unconsciousness decision making as an ""instinct"" that the human mind makes on its own. The second half of the book the author wonders off into a re-interpretation of unconscious thinking as something that is a product of extensive training and experience. The preface of the book is ""The power of thinking without thinking"". With the two different interpretations of unconscious thinking, I am not sure the thesis of the book was proven. For anyone with little education into the human mind, this could be a good primer on unconscious thinking, otherwise, leave it alone."
2,Shallow,I found this book pretty shallow. I think the same message could have been communicated in a short essay or paragraph. 95% of the book is examples which simply dilute the basic message.
1,Seriously someone published this?????,I have never written a review before but I owe it any unsuspecting reader out there to tell you.....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY -- THIS BOOK IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!! Seriously someone published this guy? The book was a bunch of antidotes that didn't deserve the page space that they received. There was maybe a small nuance of a point but it was so minor that it wasn't really a point at all. This is highway robbery. I wish desperately I could get a refund. I read about 50 books a year and this is hands down the most horrible waste of time and worst book I have ever read!!
2,Book's obvious views could've been delivered in a short article,"Some points make sense; many don't. The viewpoints could have been well delivered in a five-page magazine article.Sensible stuff:- Much information may be extracted from a brief encounter (for instance, the lab that fairly accurately predicts success in marriage from viewing the brief conversation of a couple)Stuff that isn't sensible to me:- More analysis can be inferior to less analysis (I consider one major example used simply unpersuasive: A team with fewer intelligence tools beat one with more sophisticated information gathering mechanism in the U.S. military war game)Stuff that seems obvious and doesn't need pages and pages to explain:- Through training, one's intuition could become more reliable for quick decision-making"
3,Just a Blink and I know what it will be,"I saw the cover of this book and I knew exactly what it would be. About a 100 pages of very interesting material and then a 100 pages of useless rubbish. My prediction was right, thus verifying the first 100 pages of his book."
2,Not as good as the Tipping Point,"If you've read the Tipping Point, you might be disappointed by Blink. I'm not sure what happened between the two, but Blink is very hard to read and not as interesting as the Tipping Point. Being a self proclaimed ""Maven"", I was telling everyone about the Tipping Point. While I wouldn't bad mouth Mr. Gladwell, I tell people it's not as good as the Tipping Point, which, by the way, is a MUST read..."
4,The topic fits,"Blink describes the underlying understanding of many things we see on TV, from our salesforce and with our day-to-day interactions with other people. Many of the presented concepts can help to drive improved marketing, speech-making and other outbound communications. I highly recommend this book and Tipping Point."
5,Blink - very insightful book,This book is terrific and has opened my eyes to so many things I never even knew before about the way the mind works and the subconscious. The stories that are told are like non-other. I recommend this book to all.
4,"Least Favorite, Most Useful","Oddly, my least favorite read of the Gladwell social-science trilogy has proven to be the most enlightening.It's been valuable to consciously note (though, not always act on) my initial reaction to any person or scenario upon first contact. I've begun recommending it to my people as well.Beyond the direct scope of the book, there's plenty to explore from the ""other side of the Blink"" that is - how to be aware of, and subsequently direct, others' Blinks of you. Combine Blink with Nick Boothman's '90 Seconds or Less' layover duo, (How to Connect in Business...&How to Make People Like You...), and you'll be on top of your cocktail game in no time.TW"
5,Title doesn't do the content justice.,"This is my third Malcolm Gladwell book in the last 12 months. The title makes it sound like one of those hand-wavy, self-improvement books that will help you be all you can be. Instead it it is a deep look at the power of first impressions and what really happens in those first micro-seconds (ie. in the Blink of an eye)."
4,A fascinating read.,"Really enjoyed this. (Listened to the audio book and find the author's voice very relaxing.)The content is fascinating, as to be expected from Mr G. It's authoritative and eye-opening. Plenty of food for thought. Love it!I'm off now to download The Tipping Point..."
2,Lesson Learned: Read a review before you buy it!,I grabbed the book of an airport bookstore...a known author...a catchy title...a good opening! From there it was downhill. Lesson learned...don't buy a book with such minimal information. Read reviews or borrow it from the library first!
3,An engaging though light read,"Blink is a fine work by the highly engaging author, Malcolm Gladwell. The premise of the book is, might it be that we make better decisions in the first few seconds rather than after hours or days of thinking about it? Well, it depends, but Gladwell presents convincing evidence why many decisions can likely be made nearly instantly. His writing is always captivating and his examples are convincing to many. This is a good book to read so long as you step back and consider alternatives and that more thorough studies are needed to validate his claims. A light read."
2,Use The Library,"I would recommend one borrow not purchase this book, and after the half-way point return it. I found the first half extremely interesting and captivating. The remainder loses the reader in a case with racial overtones and fails to establish a logical relationship with the first half. I read a comment by another that seemed apropos: describe a new method of building an office building by explaining briefly a new building method and what the building might look like when finished. And, then talk about some of the surrounding pavement, you'd have ""Blink,"" well--in a blink."
3,"""Train your brain""","I found this a rather typical self-help book, but Gladwell's insights into thinking and how we do it, why we make the decisions that we do, and how to ""look both ways first"" are still interesting. Worth a look, but don't expect to learn something truly earthshaking and groundbreaking."
4,Interesting read,I enjoy Gladwell's perspective and he does a good job of correlating the research to his observations. A good read but the book needs a little more depth.
4,a high recommendation on a book with the power of thinking,"Gladwell did surprise us with a lot of hard facts about how certain people possess the ability to ""do the things right"" without even thinking. An interesting read, but unfortunately lacks of a central belief in his book. After reading, you just have this difficulty to conclude the lesson learned here!It reminds me of another book, ""From Lowbrow to Nobrow"" (Peter Swirski, 2006) which is with an enjoyable writing style and a strong point to support the writer's keen observations and insights to fulfill your apetitie of learning. It clearly depicts the unique phenomenon of the popular culture of today. I personally highly recommend you to take a look at this book as it is a book of thinking power!"
5,A must-read book,"This is a really important book. In fact, I found it more valuable than The Tipping Point, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. There are numerous powerful insights, but the key insight for me--Look for the essential thing and do not let additional information about a subject cloud your vision. I did not understand how distracting too much information can be. I recommend the book and the insight in all my leadership seminars."
3,Airport science book,The author makes the following points: 1) sometimes you can make a correct decision very quickly; 2) sometimes a very quick decision is wrong. In his book he states that he has taken a whole year to write this slender volume. This book is the scientific equivalent of a trashy airport novel - it passes the time and then you forget it. It would be a very good buy if you don't read novels and are taking a trip - a short trip.
5,Blink : The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,"This is an excellent book. It really makes you think about snap decision making, how we all do it, how some people are more adept at it, and how to become better at it. It's a really enjoyable read."
4,not bad,"tipping point was a much better book in my opinion. i enjoyed the diversity of the examples in the tipping point. blink caught my attention faster but towards the end, the ideas and examples began to get repetitive. Not a bad read though!"
1,The arguments in this book are so poor that they are funny,"For a book that has received so much acclaim, I'm surprised by the number of logic holes in Malcolm Gladwell's arguments. He is also very verbose and talks about many random things that are unrelated to the topic of the book. The arguments look like obvious attempts to make money by deceiving the general public. By far, one of the poorest books I've read in a long time."
4,good read,I am reading blink for the 2nd time now due to the enjoyment I had when I first read it. It is a very animated and easy to read book that basically highlights several examples of our adaptive unconscious mind and how it works and comes up with decisions. He also dwells on the concept of thin slicing which is the predicting patterns and behaviors/trends by zooming in on the slices of experiences that matter the most and coming up with a rather unsconscious decision from it.. I really love the book and highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it merely highlights how the process works but does not provide means and ways of improving our skills of the adaptive unsconciscous.. however the author points out to other works by authors like Paul Ekman and John Gotman and others that provide the next step...
2,Gut feeling was right,My gut feeling after reading a few pages was that I shouldn't waste my time by reading this book. I still did. My gut feeling was right - I found the book quite noninteresting and repetitive save for a few passages.
3,half the book is worth a read,The first half of the book was an interesting read. The main idea and the meat of the book is unique and thought provoking. The latter half of the book felt like the author was trying to hit a word limit as it got redundant. He sold me his ideas in this first half of the book and lost me in the second half.
1,Blinking waste of time!,"The author feeds you some entertaining anecdotes about everyting from the fraud archelogical findings to cops in extreme circumstances to marketing research. Unfortunately, the point of the book is a very primitive one: sometimes we are right in our snap judgements and sometimes we are wrong. He even comes up with the a catchy new term: ""thin slicing"". In my opinon however, the only place where you can't go wrong with thin slicing is a deli. So, go spend your money on a nice sandwich and skip this book. If you must read it - get it from a library."
2,Boring,"My first intuition for this book was good (or what Gladwell would say ""was my gut intuition""), but I failed. This book is boring, full of repetitive examples (some of them very interesting, specially the first chapters), but at the end you get nothing in conclusion. We all know that people with more experience on their fields can get a very accurate explanation to some phenomena with very little information, is this new? My gut intuition did not work for this book."
3,YAWN,"The premise IS interesting. The process is not. Author relates one study after another, after another, after another. These articles are meant to establish that we know what we know instinctively.The big turnoff in this book was the author's heavy racial bias."
2,Worth Thinking About,"When I saw 'The Power of Thinking Without Thinking' in the store, I instantly thought that it was just another shelf-stacker designed to fleece gullible readers and to secure for the author ten minutes of frivolous fame on the chat show circuit. But after skimming it, I thought it might offer positive insights into the all-too-human habit of immediate judgments. Having now read it, I will be forever grateful to Malcolm Gladwell for proving that my initial assessment, albeit hasty, had been right. Had I applied the power of thinking without thinking in the store, I would have saved myself $15."
1,This was good for you??,"I do not understand why this book earned decent reviews. The people who gave this book 4-5 stars, are they real? or are they part of Marketing tricks nowadays. This book was the most naggingly-redundant book I've ever read, constantly repeating scenes and lessons like my mom would with her stories. I'm no expert, Im just the average Juan who wants a good read..and being average makes me wonder what is wrong with these ""experts"" giving it a thumbs up. I could have bought a different book if it werent for these people giving it a good review. Just another tall tale, skip this one, it aint worth it."
2,I did more than blink - I slept,"I thought, hoped that this would be as good as the Outliers. It wasn't. I didn't finish it, which I rarely don't."
3,"Good writing, but too much blinking and not enough thinking","Gladwell writes very well. Blink captured my attention for the few hours it took to read it, and it was hard to put down. The problem is that Gladwell focuses more on fluff than on substance. He practices what he preaches, ""thinking without thinking."" The end result is a book that is entertaining without educating. For me, that is not enough.As Thomas Edison was fond of saying, ""There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking."" Gladwell gives us lazy people an excuse to rely on our intuition and avoid thinking. But can we tap the power of thinking without thinking? I don't think so.Although not as well-written, and nowhere near as popular, I found Michael LeGault's critique of Blink, titled Think, the better book. In my mind, better think than blink."
2,A collection of anecdotes in search of a theme,"Malcolm Gladwell has pulled together a series of nicely-told anecdotes about .... something. He doesn't put much effort into trying to explain what is going on, whether in fact anything interesting actually is going on, nor does he make a convincing case that the various examples he uses actually have anything in common. I couldn't see much connection among museum curators being able to recognize fake sculptures, psychologists predicting the strength of a couple's relationship based on watching a conversation, and a former Special Forces soldier using unconventional guerilla tactics to outwit the military establishment. Gladwell's journalistic background comes through in his easy writing style and lack of intellectual rigor. It's easy to read and easy to forget."
3,Interesting but oversimplified,How can a few experts tell in a blink of a second that a sculpture is a fake when all of the scientific tests say it is authentic?What is examined in this book is the minds ability to make snap decisions with the barest amount of information and often doing much better than people with unlimited time and information.I have to say that this book is very interesting and actually reflects my personality. The longer I have to think about something the more liekly I will get it wrong. I was trained as an infantry sergeant which requires snap decisions but I have been this way my whole life.On the whole this book was a good read and I recommend it to others but I remember thinking the whole time I was reading it that all of the examples were anecdotal. I can find enough anecdotal evidence to support just about anything no matter how ridiculous. The books major failing is its ability to show any hard data to support its suppositions.Read it but don't take it too seriously
2,Blink and You Might Miss the Science,"The book Blink is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes about snap judgements and decision making without thinking. The problem is that there is very little science or other supporting evidence to back up or explain the phenomena that are the subject of this book. The book is more pop science than a work of serious study.God forbid if more people think without thinking. We have enough of that as it is in business, government, and other areas where real thinking and leadership are required."
1,Disappointment!!!,"I am sad to say how disappointed I was with Blink. After reading Tipping point I expected this book to be another phenomenal book, making the complex simple. Alas it did what Einstien warned us about ""Make things as simple as possible and not any simpler.""This book tried to argue that we need to let go of the logical thought and analytical thinking in favor of gut feelings. ""Think"" by Michael LeGault is a rebuttal to this book and I think it is worth reading in conjunction with Blink. Why? because implications of pattern based thinking (whcih is how our brain processes information at the fundamental level) and what Blink argues for, is deeply powerful, yet is a fundamental imperative to use the carefully balanced approach in decision making that uses instinct and mixes it with analytical thinking. Without this balance our society can be regressing towards middle ages as opposed to advancing towards the next creative era of growth."
2,Blink Too Quickly and You'll Miss Gladwell,"I don't understand what the rage is about this book. I found it to be disjointed and lacking in real actionable or interesting information. We should study Gladwell in terms of how he has somehow managed to have an entire generation of savvy business leaders depend on what he says when his own real experience in leading a business is nil.In terms of marketing, and leadership I would recommend ""Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word Of Mouth Marketing"" - there's an amazing amount of actionable and easy to understand applicable ideas in terms of behavior, business, customers and making meaning instead of buzz.Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing"
1,"I've reached my ""tipping point"" over Blink.","One anecdotal story after another with a weak conclusion (which was yet another anecdotal story) attempting to tie it all up left me flat. Here's my summary: All you need to know is ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" well... unless you're an expert of some sort. In that case, you can trust your initial reaction, because you're probably right. Well... unless you've paid attention to the wrong things... in which case you are proabably wrong. So, Don't judge a book by its cover - ESPECIALLY THIS BOOK!! You will see it on the bestseller list and assume it is worth reading (as The Tipping Point arguably was) rather than a weak, seemingly rushed attempt to ride on the coattails of his earlier success."
2,Not in a blink,"I was about to buy the book, since the subject and the assumed hypothesis look appealing and interesting. Then my Amazon friend Conan wrote a rather lukewarm review and I delayed the purchase. Then I found the book on my daughter's shelf. Thanks to Conan for saving my money.I borrowed the book and read it. In a blink I thought it was as interesting as it had promised. It took me more than a blink to find out, that it does not deliver: you learn some interesting anecdotes about marriage predictions and about malpractice suits (my other Amazon friend Joe Neuschatz will be interested) and such things, but you never really get nearer to understanding what the alleged special rapid intelligence process really is.The book reminds me a bit of the style of articles in Der Spiegel: journalism well short of science. Sometimes entertaining, but mostly disappointing."
4,Good stuff,"I first heard this in High School from a friend and just dug this album. Listening to it now, almost two decades later, it is still good. It's a good pop/dance CD. It is a thoroughly enjoyable album."
3,Fair,"I like the song by Linear called, ""Sending All My Love"", because I liked that song since I was little. It sure is a nice song that dates back to 1990. The Freestyle jams remind me of teenage women, men, boys, and girls, and of course, young women and men from back in the high school years of the 1980s and 1990s. Anyway, I like Linear okay."
5,Required Reading,"There are so many really good business books out there, and many to be read in various niches that fit our own industries, but none is more important today than 2020 Vision. It should be required reading for every business owner, every business leader, every MBA student, and everyone going forward in business that plans to be around in the next quarter century and longer. This book will stimulate you to do things you hadn't conceived of before in ways you could never have imagined. Business as usual will no longer work. These guys are spot-on. This train hasn't just left the station, it's left the planet. Run, don't walk, and get yourself a copy. Read it now."
3,Good but a little ancient,This book does a good job predicting the evolution of the information economy but it's not as much use anymore because it was published in 1991. The world has changed so much in the last 20 years that a lot of his predictions are truth or they need repackaged in order to envision the 2040 generation. He was pretty right about the information economy though! It's definitely happening. We still don't have smart toilets yet though... Guess that prediction didn't work out as well.
3,kwame fan to my heart,"I thought kwame was a funny lookin and funny sounding fella but he could put out a jam that made you buy his albums. In this album he went with more singing but it was no doubt, call me crazy but this is an album with songs youll never forget. KWAME, If you are out there good luck with the career"
2,Ownlee Ueu and Oneovdabigboyz make it worth purchasing,Not the greatest album overall but with 2 outstanding dance tracks. It'll remind you that rap was once funky and funny without needing to be so hard. Kwame's delivery is like Special Ed's for those of you who remember...
2,Very average at best but a fun era,Kwame was catchy but no special skills still it was a change of pace.he was Like WIll Smith but without all of the straight to Pop vibe.OwnLee eue was a catchy cut.this was when Rap was Fun.before all of the over the top Commerciallism and cheapness to Hype anybody.
2,Nice...But Easy to Break,First off I want to say that this product does everything it's supposed to no problem. Everything is easy to use and understand and a lot of people think I paid a fortune for it. Unfortunately things started to go downhill. There are two buttons that stopped working after about 2 weeks. They still work but you have to press down as hard as you can to press them and sometimes that doesn't even work. Also the music only comes out of one side of the headphones now. Overall I think this would be a great MP3 player...if it didn't just break for no reason.
4,Great!,"No complaints what so ever! Item arrived on time. Neatly packaged, Cd unscratched, works great. I'm very happy with my purchased."
5,YUMMY!!!,"This is the perfect gift for anyone who is a snacker that doesn't like the usual food gifts (meat and cheese, candy, etc). I purchased this for my husband for Valentine's and I was quite pleased with the quality. The nuts are large, whole nuts and the popcorn has a good flavor...not too sweet. Although it would be considered ""pricey"" as an everyday item, I will definitely buy this again as a gift."
3,I use it but I should have looked for better quality,It works. The base clamp isn't as sturdy as it needs to be for such a long arm so you have to be careful. You get what you pay for (I think I paid ~$8).
4,Exactly what I wanted,"Exactly what I wanted. Fanny pack works well on my pistol belt. But recommend that you also order military suspenders. The pack can get heavy & pull down your belt, straining the lower back."
5,A Good One Without Question,"About 70 % T & A and 30% ""other"" all in good to excellent video Quality. Half outdoors and half at a couple of Key West bars. Impressive and without compromise wet t shirt contests."
2,Good but not great,"I READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE ALL MY MATES WERE BANGING ON ABOUT IT, GOING READ IT, YOU KNOW? LIKE SO WE COULD ALL PHILOSOPHISE AND STUUF, WELL I READ IT AND i HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS DISSAPOINTED, ARTHUR'S OPINIONS ARE AT ONCE FASCINATING AND LIMITING. THEY LIMIT MY GOALS AND ABILITY, YOU KNOW? BUT SERIOUSLY I THINK THAT ARTHUR PROBABLY SHOUD HAVE DONE A COUPLE MORE VERSIONS SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIKE DIFFERENT TASTES COULD ALL TAKE SOMEHTHING FROM IT. I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL LIKE THIS BOOK WHO MAYBE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, CAUSE ITS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH WHICH IS DEFINITELY A PLUS."
3,Okay Keyboard,"This keyboard works well with the console. It should only be used to enter text, otherwise the PS3 Console hasnt really been set up to take commands from a keyboard. You will need to have a controller handy while Sony does more software upgrades for keyboard shortcuts etc."
5,"great, light weight, wireless keyboard","I thought this was a blue tooth keyboard which wouldn't require a receiver with my PS3. Despite my own misunderstanding, it's Great! It's still wireless and you probably won't ever use the other 3 USB ports on your PS3 while using the keyboard anyway. It's a little too light weight for my liking, but the keyboard works great and took less than a minute to get it to work with my PS3."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"I liked that it had a thumb pad so you didn't have to switch between the keyboard and the controller to do most things. It does what you'd expect. You can type and its easy enough to use. The only issue I can think of, and its minor, is that you have to remember to turn it off."
3,Worth the money,"I am extremely happy with this keyboard. For the little amount of internet browsing I do on my PS3, this is more than worth it. I usually just use it for messaging between me and my friends, and that is more than enough. Really good product for the price. If you absolutely must have all functions of your PS3 available through a key board, then this is not for you. But if you just want to be able to type faster, pick it up."
4,Cordless MediaBoard Keyboard,"works great on my spare desktop i have setup next to my tv, not on a ps3. i like that it has the left/right click mouse buttons on where the windows(start) and alt key are normally on at the left side next to the space bar, makes it easier that using the touchpad mouse buttons. connectivity works great, i can sit 15-20"" away without issue. so yeah, you do lose the keypad and window start key(i use it more often than normal), no special features like multimedia buttons, otherwise a good buy for the price i paid with free shipping."
4,Liked the Keyboard!,"The keyboard got here fast. Sony has not built a lot of functionality with the use of a keyboard in their system, though. But the keyboard does what it is supposed to do and does it well!!"
5,great,at game stop you have to pay 10 dollars more plus tax. the free shipping from amazon is fast and convenient.
5,Pretty cool...... (and useful too),"This is really convenient (keyboard + mouse) -- since it communicates via USB, it isn't limited to the ps3 -- it works great with laptops too (way better than buying a separate usb keyboard and mouse)"
4,Good,"I bought the keyboard to use with my PS3 & Linux and it works very well. It seems to have good range and operation. I'm not sure of battery life yet. One thing missing - though maybe I am a newbie - if you set the PS3 to reboot into OtherOS there doesn't appear to be a keyboard function that will turn the PS3 back on (ie, like pressing the PS button does for GameOS)"
4,awesome keyboard for ps3,"I am typing this review on this keyboard as we speak. its a wonderful device. the pros definately outweigh the cons. the built in touch mouse is great, it even has a side the mimics a scroll button. the keyboard feels most like a laptop keyboard. right down to the mouse pointer. very lightweight, no lag or anything. the only cons, which i'd be nitpicking about is 1: no bluetooth 2: runs off batteries instead of something rechargable. 3: no ten-key (again like a laptop) 4: no playstation button to jump to the xmb when you want to 5: no zoom button. but those are minor things. the only reason i would want a ps button and a zoom key is so i can operate my ps3 to a greater extent using just the keyboard. but all in all, it is a wonderful product. a must have."
4,Pretty Good,Works great still need to have the controler close by to adjust the view. Also needs a 10 key touch pad.
4,Cheaply made but works,"The keyboard works great, with my HTPC and my PS3.Just plug it in and it works.Its very light and very cheap feeling. I'm very happy with it because I got it for $40 new from a vendor. The $80 the stores and others charge IMO are not worth it from a quality standpoint, but there are no other keyboards like it on the market."
5,PS3 Cordless Megaboard,"PS3 has a similar mediboard but it's more expensive, why pay more for the same mediaboard? It is awesome. No complaints. Just remember to turn it off or you'll run your battery dead."
3,Not Bad....but why no blue tooth?,Would make alot more sense to buy the bluetooth version than the 2.4ghz. Wish PS3 would support firefox.
3,Good,Does what it is supposed to do very well.Works with the PS3 and a normal computer too.If you are going to use it with just the PS3...make sure you really need it before you buy it
1,Wait for bluetooth,"If you don't want to have to use up one of your USB slots on the PS3, Logitech is coming out with a bluetooth version of this board. Called the Mediaboard Pro, it is expected to hit the market in November."
1,Very disappointed!,"I bought this at a local store sight unseen. I ordered it special. I took it home & was very disappointed. I was expecting to hear the terrific bombastic score that was in the movie, but alas it was not there. I did get my terrific score though. It took a couple days & a very expensive music editor, but my computer & I snagged it right off the video, complete with sound effects. Sounds like a regular war zone. Sorry guys, you'll have to make your own (or someone might get upset with me). It would be nice though if someone would make a soundtrack from the score, cuz I would like to buy it! I only gave this one star cuz there wasn't a choice for zero stars."
4,I love it BUT,I kinda would like to know the YEAR of each song - they tell you 50's and 60's but they don't tell you what year any of them were released...
2,A disappointing sequel to a great book.,"What a disappointment! I loved Vurt, especially in the Books-On-Tape reading, and I was looking forward to learning more mysteries of the Vurt. This book revealed very little that was new and abandoned its hip-slang narrative voice that made Vurt such a pleasure, in favor of narration by a middle-aged Shadow-cop with little sense of humor. When I finished reading Vurt, it seemed like Jeff Noon's inventiveness was boundless. After finishing Pollen, I felt his imagination had been exhausted long before the book ended. Too bad!"
2,science fiction?,"It is hard to categorize an author like Jeff Noon, but this book seems to move further from science and fiction and more into fantasy. About half way through I thought ""this is just getting silly"". I think I prefer an edge of reality in my sciece fiction that was missing from this title. ..yes Vurt was a good book and I think the sense of mystery it maintained allowed the bizarre world portrayed to keep its consistent feel. But Pollen offers incomplete, and implausible explanations or lack of explanations for things better left unsaid."
2,Disappointed,"I, unlike most readers of this book, I suppose, did not read the prequel, Vurt. I was suckered in by the comparisons to Gibson. I must confess I was sorely disappointed. There were interesting characters, and a fairly interesting plot, but as a whole the book just shouted, look at this cool idea I have for a story, see, SEE. The writing certainly was not as tight as Gibson's, and I really had trouble caring what happened to the characters. Oh well."
4,deeper into the vurt?,"I loved Vurt, and finishing it, headed straight for Pollen. However I found Pollen fairly heavy going about half way through, and by the end i was in no doubt that Vurt was the better book. That was 3 years ago when I first read them. A re-reading last (southern) summer left me with a different opinon. Now that I knew the end, I found Vurt less satisfying, and Pollen the more intellectually engaging book. The sheer depth of Pollen is what led me back to it, and although it lacks the punch of Vurt, it is a more mature piece of writing. Vurt has all the joy of a carnival ride, Pollen is the universe the ride is in. They compliment one another at different depths. read them both (with a break in between!)."
3,It's not Vurt but...,"I like the writing style and the whole thing is very original but after _Vurt_ this was definitely disappointing. The characters were not as much fun as _Vurt_, the scenes weren't as cool as _Vurt_. I would have liked it a lot more if it was about 100 pages shorter. It just dragged and even at the end I didn't get excited, although the comical version of Charon was hilarious.A warning to cyberpunkers that haven't read _Vurt_ there really is no 'science' involved in this 'cyberpunck' novel. It really is more like a modern fantasy - no computers and no technobable.If you like his style a lot try it, if you're not impressed with his prose leave it on the shelf."
5,blinding,Noon manged to draw me so into the book I couldn't stop reading it - every page kept me turning to see what would happen next. All pre-concieved conceptions of dreams and reality were thrown into dis-array - no book has made me want to take up writing more than this one. I only hope all his books are this good :-)
5,Exceptional & charming illustrations to classic child author,"This is a truly wonderful children's book, filled with page after page of lush, tender and charming illustrations done by foremost children's book illustrator Loretta Krupinski. Poems and stories by the classic authoress, M.W. Brown, are the inspiration - always written with flair, grace and perfect understanding of how little boys and girls tend to view the world. An exquisite selection of Brown's work, grouped under headings such as Adventure, Big & Little, Bedtime, Belonging, Nonsense, and Nature, this treasurey will delight young & old alike for years to come. ...truly beautiful and outstanding in every way with illustrations as imaginative and colorful as the text."
1,Dumb,"Dumb, stereotypic juvenile humor for adults (or juvenile adults depending upon point-of-view). NOTHING imaginative in the writing, acting or whatever. Overspent valuable time even writing this much. Actually might fit well with Zookeeper."
1,awful,"The commercial for this movie was the highlight. The script was terrible and, for all the action, beyond boring. It's too bad, an amazing cast. Jamie Foxx was the highlight. Save your money and your time."
2,waste of money. BUT Jennifer Anniston Looks Great!,"Jennifer Anniston has the only great scenes in the movie. And ironically, although I think she is great looking, I've never thought she is good in any movie I've seen her in ... except this movie. But her scenes are limited. Don't waste your money or time on this one - even when it comes out on cable for free."
1,Hoped for more from this cast!,"As a big fan of Arrested Development, nearly all the cast and quirky clever comedies, my husband and I hoped this would fit the bill. Sadly mistaken. Great premise, just too overtly nasty and in your face sexual to be sustainably funny. There can be only so many references to genitalia and sex...and then you are just not writing a script well at all...your just hoping that sex is going to be funny for 1.5 hours and people are going to keep laughing.Funny cast, more than great possibilities...just to overt to make it happen for me."
1,Sick and disturbing,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was especially surprised at Jennifer Aniston, who up until this movie, I enjoyed watching and trusted. She must be desperate for work to have agreed to play this part, like Sandra Bullock in ""All About Steve"". The script was nothing but filth. Whoever wrote it must be a pervert. The only thing funny about it was Colin Ferrell's disguise. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's a worthless waste of time."
4,A good silly laugh,"I am not sure why reviewers mix the review of the actual content of the movie with the quality of their DVDs. Maybe Amazon could do something about that. Because it is not doing justice to the viewers or the movie for that matter.As for the movie, I had very low expectations but it surprised me ... It is goofier than I thought - just a silly movie to laugh with some fun twists that will surprise you.Nothing you would remember a few days later, but for $4 - yea live a little, get a laugh since we can't really kill bad bosses."
1,Sorry Charlie (Day) - Promptly returned due to digital copy,"I promptly returned this Blu-ray to Amazon after ordering due to the Ultraviolet digital copy being WORTHLESS! I paid extra for the digital copy version so that I could have something to watch on my iPad on a plane, etc. Unfortunately, the studios have decided that we need a new type of digital copy, separate from all of the digital versions we have on iTunes, etc. Terrible idea! I hope this new digital copy format promptly goes away so that I can go back to buying blus with confidence.That being said, the movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it had enough moments to make for an enjoyable viewing experience."
4,Great cast but missed the bullseye.,The beginning and the end worked for me but the middle was a bit slow. Great turn by Colin Farrell... and Kevin Spacey is always sooo evil!
1,CAN'T TRANSFER DIGITAL COPY TO MY ITUNES!,"This is NOT a review of the movie which I haven't watched yet but I'm sure is great. I usually cringe at reviews like this but I just can't let this one fly.Like stated in another review this ""digital copy"" is worthless to itunes users (most of us). I wish I would have known that before since this isn't worth anywhere near the $25 without it. I was planning on watching this movie on a flight on my ipad. I will not buy any movie with the new ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"". I'm returning this one even though it's opened because I feel this is a scam."
3,Horrible Bosses Funny but why Kevin Spacey?,"I love Jennifer Anniston's Performance and Collin Farrel's,but I don't care for New Snl/Sudekis or anyone else and the Major Props goes to MF'r Jones(Jamie Foxx)the movie is amusing but We have already seen Bad Bosses(Classic-Office Space),my hatred for all things of ChavezCastroKissing Spacey makes me less fond of the movie,I must say Anniston is beautiful with Dark Hair and very seductive even if foul-mouthed,and Colin Farrel is nuts,but not enough to make me love the movie."
2,Waste of talent,For a movie that had so many known actors it was a complete waste of time. The plot was completely unbelievable and I couldn't even convince myself that it was just a comedy movie and to try and enjoy it.
3,ANISTON'S BEST ROLE IN A LONG TIME,"The best thing about this darkly comic romp is the lecherous dentist Jennifer Aniston effortlessly inhabits. A big-screen hit, a 106-minute home video version features a slightly edgier cut as three inept employees team up to murder their tormenting bosses. Yes, it's insanely crazy behavior, but we actually cheer them on until we come to our senses after final fade out and ask ourselves: What was I thinking?Apparently vengeance is wired into our genes."
1,Not Originals,I will be sending back horrible bosses and I would like a full refund this is a copy of the movie . I'd much rather pay the extra 6 dollars at the store and get an original copy. I am certain this is not as even the piture of the cover is photo copied . Do not get scammed
1,Another Aniston Flop,Maybe the ending made this movie worth suffering through but I just couldn't watch any longer to find out. I should have known it was a dud with Jennifer Aniston in it and I really liked her in Friends. A dissapointment.
3,decent movie,I gotta say the best part of this movie is Charlie Day's performance. He is the primary source of laughter. I found a lot of the movie to be over the top and ridiculous. But it wasn't a bad movie.
1,Digital copy scam,How is it not illegal to tell us that you get a DIGITAL COPY only to play from flixster as a streaming video. This is not the first time WB has done this on movies. If you say it is my digital copy then make it possible for me to watch it on the device I want. The Blu Ray plays on all Blu Ray players so why can't I watch this on my IPOD.I payed good money only to be ripped off.I spent the 8.00 dollars more and can't use it.
5,Very Funny Movie,This is a great movie and a very funny plot. I enjoyed the humor and the situations depicted in the film.
5,Awesome,"The movie wasn't that bad! Half of the 1-2 star reviews are people complaining about how vulgar the movie is. Why in the world would you buy a movie rated R, which even lists the reason WHY it is rated R, if you didn't want to see vulgarity. Go buy Toy Story 3 and get a good laugh out of that if you are so uptight. For people who enjoy crude comedy, and have actually read WHY it is rated R, should definitely at least rent the movie and check it out. Its especially good for college aged students to go along with movies like The Hangover, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to The Greek, etc. This is NOT a clean comedy. Emphasis on the NOT. Another thing, watch Its Always Sunny if you haven't ever seen Charlie Day in anything, because I can see how he could get annoying to people who have never seen his type of comedy."
2,YEP DIGITAL COPY IS HORSE****,"Yep, all the reviewers are correct. Ultraviolet will fail. I knew it right from the point it made you create mnultiple account and link them etc. etc. for a streaming thing on their app that crashed everytime i use it. sorry but you failed. im taking mine back to best buy now and exchanging for single bluray."
3,Needs A Little Bill Lumbergh,"The bosses(Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell) are terrific. It's their whiny minions that are annoying. I'm on the fence with this one. As shock comedy goes this is pretty mundane. As a workplace comedy it could have used the subtlety of ""Office Space"". Really, to be harassed by Aniston is a real stretch to the imagination. She's never been sexier. I will also mention that Jamie Foxx is pretty good as the hired ""hit man"". He's not good enough for me to recommend this movie, however."
3,Not as good as expected.,"I ordered this movie because I had heard it was a very funny movie. It was okay. I didn't necessarily think it was a waste of time to watch, but it was not funny enough that I would have wanted to own the movie. I should have paid $1 at Redbox to watch the movie and saved some money."
2,So bad I had to turn it off,"The only good part about this movie was Jennifer Aniston in a doctors outfit. Maybe it's because I'm still in school and don't yet have a career, but I found this movie to be completely unfunny. The jokes were crude and overused, the characters were completely unlikable. I turned this off about half way through. I gave it two stars instead of one because of Jennifer Aniston."
3,Horrible Bosses,"This movie was slightly funny. It should have been a hoot. It had great stars and Jennifer Aniston looks incredible as always. No matter how hard she tries, she comes across as sweet in some way. Kevin Spacey was right in his element as the psycho. I rememeber when he first started off as a kingpin in the series ""Wiseguy"" with Ken Wahl. He was an excellent bad guy and that's what gave the movie the punch it did have. With all the talent in this movie, it was not really funny. I can't explain why. Oh, I know, it was the guy who kept messing things up for the trio. Better writing would have helped the movie."
3,Amusing enough. Neither great nor horrible.,"As the title of my review says, the movie was amusing enough. It was worth the rental fee, was entertaining enough, got some good laughs out of me, and was neither great nor horrible.The one star reviews are unfair to it, but so are the five star ones, extremely so. The movie really deserves three stars, in my opinion. I'd rent it again, it was worth the money."
2,Horrible quality from Amazon,"The video jumped a lot. We have the top of the line package from Comcast, so doubtful the problem is on our end. Next time we'll try Blockbuster."
2,a few laughs,"It's a sort of implausible story, which would be okay, if the humour didn't sound primarily in 'attitude.' It's not bad, and probably 'middling' but because you expect more from these actors, you come off more disappointed than you'd expect, even if you don't expect that much.If you're bored and looking for decent comedy, there are just probably better options, is all."
2,Oh PLEASE!,"Someone find me a movie with a normal screenplay in which characters are not caricatures, PLEASE! Another great cast struggling to salvage this piece of garbage. A couple of good one-liners and laughs do not make a movie. Barely watchable."
3,3 1/2 stars for a not horrible movie,"I knew going into this movie that I would have a problem accepting the fact that Jennifer Aniston is a dentist, let alone the idea that she could ever be a turn-off sexually. In general, this is a pretty funny movie. It is better than ""Hangover 2"" but falls short of ""Bridesmaids"" in the scheme of ""R"" rated comedies this year. Jason Bateman plays Nick in his usual cool, but nerdy at the same time, way. Jason Sudeikis is Kurt and is always funny. Finally, newcomer Charlie Day (""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") plays the sexually harassed employee of Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston). In reality the best roles may be for the mean bosses, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell. And Jamie Foxx steals his scenes as the hit man go between. The set up is kind of ridiculous. The 3 friends marching into a `gansta' bar is absurd. Still, well just enjoy the laughs."
1,Ultraviolet Blows,"This review is specifically being written to downvote the movie for its Ultraviolet digital copy. After being forced to create accounts for Flixster and Ultraviolet, they don't let me download the movie. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE. SCREW ULTRAVIOLET."
2,"Bosses are funny, plot is lame","As long as the focus is on the 3 horrible bosses, then this is actually pretty funny, especially Jennifer Aniston as the over sexed dentist, who sexually harasses her male assistant. Kevin Spacey is great, too, as the ogre boss, as is the third guy who plays the coked out son who inherits his saintly dad's business and proceeds to wreck it. However, the main plot, involving the usual three stooges who decide to kill their bosses, is quite lame and not even worth watching. It's a shame because they had a good premise here. If they had just sustained the title theme throughout, this could have been a winner. As it is, it's just another unfunny comedy with the usual three boobs running amok."
4,Hilarious,Watched this twice just to laugh over and over again. This film brings out the truth when it comes to bosses.I have been in similar situations believe me. Too fun too funny this film.
3,Lost potential,"There were some funny parts in this movie, but it seems like the directors didn't really take advantage of them. The movie had a surprisingly strong cast and a potentially really funny plot, but in the end the main events go by way too quickly. Plot twists like being accused of a murder are great entries into comedy, but it seems before the full weight of the accusation sinks in the movie ends. I don't really know if this movie deserved 2 full hours, but at 1.5 hours it just seems like it's going through the motions."
4,Funny as hell!,"Good fun! All the bosses do a great job in their roles and the chemistry between jason bateman, charlie day and jason sudakis is great! even jamie foxxs' part was on par! if you enjoy the style of the comedy of late than youll get a kick out of this one!"
3,"""What Would Gam Gam Want You To Do?""","The 2011 film `Horrible Bosses' does so many things right but still gets only -3 Stars- out of 5 on my review scale. In other words, yea I enjoyed the movie but don't really care to sit through it again. It's kind of a surprise since I enjoy all the major actors and actresses in the cast (and there are a lot of rather well known ones in minor roles), the storyline is well paced, the dialogue witty and the subject matter something that most working adults out there can relate to on some level. Hasn't everyone hated their boss at one time or another?Yet with all those positives going for it I found `Horrible Bosses' lacking that indefinable something necessary to transform a good film into a great one. Well worth a viewing, you'll definitely get a laugh or two from this one. But will you look forward to a repeat viewing? I doubt it."
2,"Crass humor, not what I expected","Watched the preview, heard others rave about it, then decided to watch it. Very disappointing. If you like really crass humor then go for it. I myself was very disappointed. I would not watch it again."
2,Not that funny,The movie got funnier when Jamie Foxx showed up but that was nearly a half hour in. The rest of the movie was funny but I would have waited to see it on cable.
5,Had loads of fun,"Its a no-brainer have fun movie. Some times the situations look too real especially if you work in the IT field or you work under bosses who are horrible. Watch it, its a real funny movie"
1,Stupid & Juvenile,"I think this script was written by a juvenile. Really stupid, gross humor. I almost had to force myself to laugh. I'm amazed that they were able to cast such big stars in this movie."
3,meh,"I love Charlie in IASIP. Jason Bateman is great in Arrested Development. Jason Sudeikis is funny dude.But, unfortunately, this movie just isn't that funny. It is mildly entertaining. I mean, I never wanted to turn it off. But there weren't many truly hilarious scenes. Bit of a disappointment."
5,Absolutely hilarious,"I loved this movie. Very funny, with an absurd but all-too-accessible plot. Jennifer Aniston has a performance that you will never forget. Definitely recommend it."
4,good movie,"horrible bosses is a good movie. its a great comedy, really made me laugh. it was fun to watch with a friend. speedy shipment as well"
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"Don't know why this movie is getting any 5 stars. I thought it was stupid and not well written. Jennifer Aniston does not make a good slut (tires to hard)she does not fit the part. Kevin Spacey does not strike me as a tough boss. Charlie Day is just annoying-had to mute it a few time because of the complaining.All in all for a comedy I say no. No comparison to the Hangover.Every time you put a lot of known actors in a movie it usually sucks. Perfect example ""Valentines Day"" another ""you got to be kidding movie."
1,Horrible movie,"This movie had potential, but ended up being one of the most boring and ridiculous movies i've ever seen. Does that Charlie day guy have to scream and yell in all of his roles?"
3,relied too much on one liners,Over all this movie was just ok... There were too many one liners and most were p*nis jokes. It was overly crude and it detracted from the film. I wouldnt watch it again.
1,Stupid,"There was nothing original in this movie, nor was there anything funny. I want the time back this movie wasted from my life!"
1,It's called HORRIBLE Bosses for a reason....,This movie is lame and that's all I can say about it. Not entertaining at all. The only good thing was Jennifer Anniston's haircut.
3,Mildly amusing - not a must watch,"Let's be honest, most people will watch this just to see Jennifer Aniston acting like a nympho. The rest of the move is in the typical 'men acting stupidly' variety. There are a few funny bits, but for the most part the movie is unmemorable."
2,"""Horrible"" Audio","I must start out by saying, this movie was amazing. No doubt one of the funniest comedies I have seen in a while. That being said, the audio on the Blu-Ray was awful. The worst audio I think I have ever heard on a movie. One minute I have to have t up at volume 70, next it gets SUPER loud and I have to bring it down volume level 11. Maybe the DVD or digital download is better.Other than the Audio levels, I would give this movie 5/5."
1,Ultraviolet Sucks,"I was going to purchase the Blu-Ray/Digital Combo of this, but I noticed that it no longer supported iTunes Digital Copy. That's the only reason I get a Blu-Ray Digital Combo pack is to have the option to stream things to my Apple TV and put on my iPhone or iPad. Flixster app sucks. I went ahead and bought it digitally. It's ashamed because I really prefer Blu-Ray when I am at home, unfortunately not an option anymore.The movie is great. Buy it in iTunes if you want a digital copy!!!"
1,ULTRA VIOLET is Horrible... Movie OK,"Ultra Violet is the worst idea ever. No download file for iTunes. With so many media server options, this will push purchasers to rent and copy movies. No to Ultra Violet......"
1,Ultra VIOLET is Horrible... Movie OK,"Ultra Violet bad bad bad.. No digital copy for iTunes, come on.The movie was OK, has its parts.Down with Ultra Violet. Media servers make watching movies enjoyable and easy. You are pushing purchasers to rip copies!"
1,Digital Copy code doesn't work,This is not a review about the movie. it's about the digital copy I paid for but didn't get because I had to go to flicksters and join to watch it as a streamed video. Couldn't download it to my iTunes. You need to specify this when selling your product.Without digital in San Francisco.
1,UltraViolet is a step backwards,UltraViolet digital copy is a terrible idea. iTunes compatible digital copy is the only standard. Don't support this garbage. You can only use them through the apps they want you to use so it will not work with an Apple TV.
3,Husband Like It,I watched it but halfway through I was bored. I found the story funny though. But the sense of humor was not for me. Jennifer is so wonderful to look at. I will pass on this.
5,Hilarious!,"Sorry I didn't see it in the theatre! The cast was amazingly funny..Jennifer Anniston (totally outside of her regular characters..loved her!!), Jason Bateman (who would get raped the most in prison??? Lmao!!!)...Charlie Day (the little Hamster!!!)...and always loved Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx (Mofo Jones)!!Highly recommend this movie..will keep you laughing beginning til the end!!!"
2,Boring as hell and not very funny.,"Ugh if you are looking for a very funny movie, I promise you this is not it. It was one of those movies I finished only because I started watching it. I was really put off by Colin Farrell. Check out Bridesmaids, Due Date or The Campaign instead all are great, funny movies."
2,Stupid Movie,"This was not very funny at all, you can watch the trailer and see all the funny parts, very disappointing."
1,Horrible Movie!,"I rented this movie as the trailer looked cute, it was so vulgar that we could not watch more than 10 minutes! I do not know anyone who swears as much as they have on this movie. I found it very offencive. It could have been cute were it not for the swearing everyother word! Who talks like this anyway? I would like a refund!"
4,Good movie,I like the cast and the theme of the movie. I was great and the making of the movie was great.
1,Terrible movie.,"I didn't start to laugh once. I've seen 8 movies in the last month and this was the worst one. All great actors and Jennifer A wow!, but nothing could make this script work. just yuck."
3,"Not bad, give it a shot.","It was entertaining, but not super funny. I'm not a big fan of the 3 main actors, but many people are."
1,Stupid,I like silly humor as much as the next guy but this was just stupid. It was a bunch of cursing and pen*s jokes the whole way through. The entire dialog was just a bunch of oneliners strung together and all of them terrible. This was a waste of money and ive never given any movie one star before.
1,Waste of my time,"Oh this was bad. Let's just say this. I only paid 99 cents for it and I still felt ripped off. I don't mind bad language when it is used in a way to make the dialogue more humorous, but it was throughout the entire movie which did not make it very funny."
1,Haven't been able to watch it.,"Dialog will not come through. Tried on different computers and browsers. $14.99 and can't watch the movie. Sent email to Amazon, I hope they respond with a positive outcome."
1,WOW. STUNNINGLY BAD!!!,"Great cast, awful film. What a stinker. We hung in for about 20 minutes, and finally threw in the towel. Glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater. Obviously it always comes down to personal preference, but how could ANYONE find this amusing????It's unoriginal, relentlessly rude, and most importantly, NO ONE in the movie is remotely likeable. And I still don't get Jennifer Aniston. She is not much of an actress, and she's pretty much the same in everything she does. Finally, I have a problemwith movies that take every opportunity to hurl a disgusting p[hrase or epithet at the audience as a substitute for genuine wit. Richard Pryor was as profane as all get-out, but he was FUNNY. Excessive references to sex organs and sex acts bear noresult except numbness. Truly a waste of time, talent and money."
2,poor writing - directing,"I rented this movie so my wife and I could enjoy a comedy instead of the ""Hallmark"" channel. Well, should have let her watch the Hallmark channel. After reading reviews, it seem to receive a gamut of reviews. Now, concise to state I am not a prude, but the language was coarse. My wife is quite sensitive to street language and I am often chastised for such. We did not finish the movie. Southern traditions are hard to overcome."
3,Was this movie that funny?,I saw the trailor first. It was not funny. I thought they were being funny and wanted us to see the real funny stuff when the movie came out.I saw the movie. IMO this is not a funny movie. I saw it with a friend. He too did not think it was funny.The best part of the film was Jennifer Anniston's over the top sex crazy charactor.All the actors did a good job.Maybe I have lost my sense of humour...perhaps I never had any or perhaps I have seen too many films. I did find the Airplane series quite funny.
3,A little dissapointed after the hype !,"I was really looking forward to seeing this flick, there was a heap of hype about it in Australia. To be honest I was left a little dissappointed.... I felt it missed the mark, pretty good comedy plot and some good casting but the script lacked punch. They could have done a lot better.I really enjoyed Jennifer Aniston as the Phyco, Nympho boss, a very funny change in role for her. Other notables where Kevin Spacey who does evil well. Jason Baitman was also very good as he is with most roles he takes on.I have given it a three, but it is just a three, a couple of really funny moments..... thats about it, it struggles to get out of second gear. It will be known as a film with good bones and no flesh and wont be a constant player in my DVD collection."
2,Would of Rated More...but can't use Digital copy on my iPod,"What the hell. I buy tons of Blu-Ray movies to get the digital copy to watch on the go with my ipod. This Ultraviolet crap using Flixster is a Horrible Idea. I can't use the digital copy, which I paid for, unless I use their dang app which crashes. Terrible way to ""move-forward"". I just cancelled my preorder of Green-Lantern because of this digital issue and my have to start cancelling more. This will, in the end, cost suppliers money because no one wants to stream movies on the go...that only works if you have WIFI and that isn't everywhere. This seems like the same deal with Netflixs and we all know how that turns out. At a time were people are watching what they spend, to start this kind of crap is again terrible. The only thing I regret is that my grammar and spelling may not reflect my education well but just too upset at this issue to let it slide."
5,Laughed Our A**ses Off!!!,"My brother and I saw this on a whim last night... listened to ""The Lonely Island"" the whole way there and didn't think we could laugh any more. Man! Were we wrong!... this movie was hilarious. In fact, this was the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time. Definitley going in my DVD collection."
2,"Insipid, Over the Top, Horrible","The movie is built around three guys having ridiculously horrible bosses - actually horrible to the point of being beyond reality. It's lowbrow comedy at best, one of the worst films of 2011 at worst. Save your time and money - watch or do something else."
1,Don't buy for digital copy,"Don't buy this movie if you are expecting a digital copy that's of any use. You have to download an advertisement ridden piece of garbage software to play it on, and there are exactly 0 devices supported for playing the digital file.Save your money and buy a DVD ripping software and make your own digital copy."
2,Not Bad.....Really Horrible,"Lots of talent wasted on a poorly written, dumb film with virtually no laughs. With the exception of Colin Farrell (who is hilarious) the cast is boring and seems to be simply trying way to hard."
1,Disappointing!,"Considering so many 4 and 5 star reviews and taking into account the super cast, I decided to buy ""Horrible Bosses."" I've got a ""Horrible Movie"" instead. Disappointing!Hey Amazon.com: where is the ""don't like it"" button?"
1,Foul mouthed drivel,"Stupid crude movie. Made no sense, really foul mouthed movie. Somebody must have owed people favors becauseThere were too many big names in this horrible movie. In fact that should be the title of the movie ""Horrible Movie""."
2,Not funny enough.,"Three friends come together and decide to eliminate their respective work supervisors, whom they all hate, for different reasons. This is another in a long line of modern-day comedies containing coarse language throughout, which does have its place (see Superbad), but at times is used to replace good comedy. In this case, the problem I have with the film is that it just isn't as funny as it should be. The movie has a strong cast, and they almost make it work. The movie does have its moments, but when the outtakes during the closing credits are funnier than the movie you just watched, you know that it was not all that good."
1,boo,"I love the people in the movie, sadly the only time I laughed was when a cat jumped on a persons shoulder and scared them."
1,Hideously moronic,"Grown-up guys acting like horny 6th graders, dumb ones at that. Who laughs at this stuff? Who gets off on the sexless sex? Why would Anniston's hygienist turn down her advances? What is with this doggy doo?"
1,Horrible Bosses,worst movie no plot poor acting foul disgusting pay day for actors that can not find meaningful work do not watch!
1,Horrible Bosses,We could only endure 22 minutes before ejecting this non-funny movie. We usually don't have issues with the occasional raunchy dialog but this was a little too low in the gutter for our taste. Definitely a let down :(
1,Horrible bosses is a horrible movie. Skip it.,"I'm not exactly sure what didn't work with this movie, but there was no chemistry, the characters didn't click, the bosses were bad, but most of us would have quit... fuzzy plot plan.... just not a good movie. Skip this one."
4,If you like comedies..,"Good movie for adults if you love to laugh. You've never seen Collin Ferrell like this before; you'll love to hate him. Jennifer Aniston makes a great perverted b-word ;) Twists throughout, enjoy.."
3,"meh, it's okay","Heard the director interviewed on KCRW's ""The Treatment"" and thought I'd give it a shot. While there are some chuckle moments, I didn't find myself laughing like crazy. For me, it was just a middle of the road comedy, neither good nor horrible. It was just product."
1,"Pathetic, disgusting work. Don't bother.","Should have been named ""Horrible Movie."" Disgusting dialog, lousy plot, could have been funny if it wasn't so unnecessarily crude. When are filmmakers going to understand that crudity for its own sake is not funny? Don't waste your money."
2,SO MUCH POTENTIAL HERE BUT NO DICE,"Yes, there was so much potential here but no dice. What an awesome cast they got together and they let it all sink down to a mediocre film at best. The biggest problem was that a good chunk of the humor just wasn't that funny. In fact, the gags running at the end were funnier than half of the humor attempts in the actual film. Tale focuses on three male friends who are under the thumb of horrible bosses and come up with the idea to have them all murdered.In the end it doesn't turn out as expected but they all get their revenge and yeah most of us saw it coming this way.Yawn and lawl. Good soundtrack. It cost $37M to make and yielded over $200M at the Box Office. This is one of those rare moments when I agree with the critics over the masses. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; HUMOR: C to C plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
3,Average Comedy,"This is a solid, middle of the road comedy. Not near as sexy as I was hoping and not near as funny as I was hoping. That said, well worth the 99 cents we paid to rent it. Wish I had more to say about the movie, but it is not one that leaves an impression. Good for a couple laughs. That's about it."
1,Meh,"I didn't think it was funny. Pretty slow, not funny... and ... slow.Not laugh out loud. Not very funny at all. Sure you may get a laugh or two during the whole movie but really?I want my $3.99 rental fee back Amazon!A B-rated movie would have been better.This was crap."
2,too vulgar,"we didn't think jennifer aniston would chose a script this far in the gutter. some parts were cute, but another movie that takes sophomoric another flush lower. avoid."
1,Not really worth seeing once,"yeah bad plot, bad acting , bad directing, funny jokes you can count on your handnot worth buying and Jennif Aniston role is just too be semi naked, probably the best part of the movie...............?"
2,I thought it was suppose to be funny..?,I heard soo many good things about this movie. I was very excited to see Colin and Jennifer in it and they made me give the movie another star so their work was good... But overall the movie sucked. I give it a chance and it failed horribley. But good idea for a movie. The reason I didn't like this movie is because I do not like Jason Saduekis or whatever his name is. To me he is not funny at all and Jason Bateman did not do that great of a job either. Bummer.
2,Horrible Movie,This movie is so not worth the money. The only good bits are in the trailer. They could have done so much more with this movie but they didn't. Don't waste your time.
1,Juvenille Humor,If you enjoy the humor of middle schoolers or high schoolers this is the movie for you. The movie moved rather slow at the start and then fell into uncreative plot devices in an effort to be humorous. And let's not forget the little stab at 10 years for video piracy. Hmmmmm makes you wonder what corporate drone wanted to make sure THAT made it on the script.Save your money..it's not worth it.
1,Beyond stupid,"The premise of this movie seemed interesting, however, it was unwatchable. We couldn't get past the inane dialogue and the idiotic characters. I think there are enough people that have realistically horrible bosses that could have been the role model for this movie (ie: Office Space) that would have been much funnier than the unbelieveably stupid ones seen here. If you're looking to have your intelligence insulted, rent this."
1,crude and tasteless,"typical of trash Hollywood is now passing off as comedy. Crude and tasteless and not the least bit funny. This is without a doubt the worst so called comedy in many years. Amazing how far the studios feel they must push the envelope to appeal to a younger audience. Sadly, most of the target demographic audience think this is real comedy."
1,Really bad movie!,"A little too crass for my tastes. Whatever happened to witty comedies? If you are looking for a moderately (and I mean monderately) clean comedy, this is really not for you."
1,Be careful where you buy!,"Please note that if you buy your disc here at Amazon - the special features and the DVD/Ultraviolet Digital Copy are NOT included in the package.The true blu ray Inappropriate Edition package is THREE discs, not just one. What you buy here ONLY has the Inappropriate Edition blu ray disc - That's It. After returning mine and going to eBay; I was able to re-purchase the complete set for $16.95. It included the aforementioned blu ray disc, the Theatrical Version blu ray disc (this is the one with all the special features advertised inappropriately -no pun intended- here) AND the DVD/Ultraviolet Digital copy disc; all as initially intended by the packaging. I just took another look at eBay. There are many listings selling the one-disc version, but there are other sellers offering the manufacturer's actual 3-disc package."
5,"very,very funny",This movie can be easily enjoyed by anybody who has worked for a bad boss. The plot was somewhat predicatble but enjoyable none the less.
3,Not what I was expecting,"The movie was decent - far fetched storyline, but funny. How can it not be funny with this cast? All in all, a fun film."
4,Good Crude Humor,"This slapsticky movie is hardly sophisticated, with lot of crude language (smut talking Jennifer Aniston) and juvenile physical humor (tooth-brush in butt). As comedy this works; I laughed and smiled through the film."
5,Who knew Jennifer was so funny???,"You know a movie is good when days later out of the blue a line from a movie pops in your head and makes you crack up, if for no other reason buy the movie for the Most hysterical comment made by Jennifer Anniston making reference to how she broke her fingernail, I laughed so hard I nearly fell off my couch, she is not always in the best movies but she won me over in this one. Also Kevin Spacey and Jamie Fox were HYSTERICAL- actually, Everyone in this movie cracked me up. CLASSIC. Funny Funny movie, haven't laughed this hard since Hangover (the first one of course.) This is not a cute movie like ""just go with it"" (which I loved) and it is rather on the crude side, but it is SO MUCH FUN and guaranteed to bring a few belly laughs from its wonderful cast."
2,"Should have been ""Terrible Horrible Bosses""","I was in the queue at the public library, but I was so far down the list (about #261), it would have taken about six months for my turn to see this movie. So when this title came up as the video deal of the day today, I thought it was worth the deal price to see it now. That was until I actually watched it.The best part of the movie was about the last 7 minutes, which included the outtakes. I'm not at all a prude, but vulgar language and innuendo, simply for the sake of so-called comedy, was a gigantic failure and a complete bore. For the first time of years of DVD-watching, this was the first time I had to check the time remaining, to see how much more of this was left to endure.That's 98 minutes of my life I'll never get back, and even though it was only 99 cents, I still feel like I'm entitled to a refund, based on extreme disappointment."
4,Worth Watchin,"My wife and I wanted to just watch a movie without having to do a lot of thinking, this was it. It was funny and well worth the 4.99 that we spent renting it."
4,Good film,This was a fun movie to watch. A good cast with some funny one-liners. Not a family movie but a good date night flick.
2,Snoozer,"Good idea, some good acting, goes on and on. Couldn't wait for it to end. Wish I had only rented this movie."
1,Save your IQ,"I love a good comedy, unfortunely this was not one of them. I'm mad that I kept watching after the first 30 minutes when my instinct told me to turn it off. Save yourself, you'd be better off taking a nap for a few hours."
1,Not Funny too Cheesy,"This movie is not funny. It's not smart, it's lame, super cheesy hollywood crap. It has a few funny parts but it's just fluffy stupid humor."
3,"Not Great, But Not Bad Either","Horrible Bosses is not...horrible. It's just not what I expected from a film with such a strong cast. In addition to the headliners, you get Jamie Foxx and cameos by Donald Sutherland & Julie Bowen. I did laugh out loud at a number of scenes, but the first 30 minutes or so left my wife and I looking at each other saying ""do we really want to keep watching this."" In the end, I'm glad that hung in there. Horrible Bosses isn't great, but it's not bad either."
5,My new favorite movie,Kept me laughing the whole time. Love Jennifer Aniston in this movie. Everything was great. I bought it for my boss & my husband's boss for Christmas!
2,I wanted to like this movie,"I wanted to like this movie, I like the actors that play the characters of the Horrible Bosses, I thought that Jennifer Aniston look amazing in her role, and that they did not make a better dialogue for her and the others. It was a really bad remake of Office Space to my opinion. It was to obvious that they were really horrible, but at the same time I felt no sympathy whatsoever for the working guys. They were just a group of lonely men with no future, nothing to like about then. I just didn't felt they deserve better bosses that the one they got, I think they have what they deserved. Really bad movie, at times was entertaining but it was just to over the top and to exaggerated."
2,No Good,"I did laugh in a few parts, but most parts were way too vulgar. It takes a lot to offend me, and some of the language (or I guess more the way things were said) was very over the edge - almost like they were trying too hard. I would not watch this again or recommend it to anyone."
3,You will like or you won't,"The movie is not slap stick comedy, but it does have some funny moments. I enjoyed it, but only worth $1.99 rental."
1,DON'T BUY DIGITAL COPY VERSION IF YOU WANT TO VIEW ON IPAD,"Got my copy today and am really upset. No support for itunes, have to stream it over wifi, using the flixster app, that has crashed several times on me. I will no longer be buying digital copies that are ultraviolet. The only reason I paid the extra money was to be able to watch on my IPAD...If you own apple products and want to use the digital copy on apple products it will not work..."
5,Hilarious!,"I was hesitant to rent this movie because it only had two and a half stars here, but we gave it a shot. This movie was freaking hilarious. My wife and I both loved it. Then we read the reviews to try to figure out why it was only two and a half stars. Some people are having some issues with the digital copy and therefore the actual movie rating is being affected. This is my first review here and I just wanted to write it to give the ratings a boost because it deserves 5 stars."
5,NEVER laughed so hard!,"I don't write reviews. I have never laughed so much. This is falling out of your chair funny. BAD SANTA may have come close. Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx stole the show for me. I know you don't know me... but trust me, SEE THIS MOVIE!"
2,digital copy is terrible,Dvd/bluray works flawless but do not buy this for the digital copy unless you want to sign up for 3 accounts and still not have a format that can be put on your ipod. Ultra violet is terrible.
5,#1 Comedy Includes Great Writing And Acting.,"In 2011 Hangover 2 was on track to be the most talked about R Rated Comedy. That held true until the release of, ""Horrible Bosses"". As a life long fan of Jennifer Aniston, I already knew I was in for a treat. The fine acting of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as well as the smart writing left me entertained and satisfied. All of the work that went into the production of this film is top notch. It is hard to say too much about this movie without giving anything away. I will say, be prepared for one of the funniest films you will see. It is too bad that the Academy of Motion Pictures does not have a category for Best Film in a Comedy because this little gem would definitely be the one to beat."
2,Loved the Movie - Hate Ultraviolet,"Quick review of the movie - my wife and I loved it, absolutely hillarious!We bought this addition because the packaging clearly says Digital Copy. A digital copy it is not! You can stream it to a computer, iPhone, etc. after a laborious process, but you have to have WIFI or cell coverage. So much for watching a movie on the plane!As this was the first Ultraviolet movie we purchased, I consider it false advertising. At least more recent releases now display Ultraviolet instead of Digital Copy on the top bar of the packaging. A type of packaging I will avoid from now on!"
5,Horrible Bosses,"One of the best comedies ever, couldn't stop laughing, this trio was amazing in this movie and Jeniffer Aniston was terrific"
2,Didn't finish it,"I was so bored with it about half way through I just gave up. The characters and situations were too over the top for me to care about, and not in a funny way."
1,Wrong Region or Wrong Planet ?,"I purchased the "" Fritz the Cat "" DVD set without first reading the customer reviews . My mistake , Two of the three disks will not play . They say only ""wrong region"" . As I live in the same state as the company that I purchased the set from ( Movie Mars Inc ) I think it odd that I'm located in the wrong region . What planet or other country should I be expected to be from ?I have undertaken the Amazon ""return program "" and the seller advertises a ""30 day satisfaction guaranty "". I will look forward to a prompt refund . I will update this review section at such time that the issue has been resolved . I have been a Amazon shopper for many years without ever before a problem ."
1,All regions my ass,"Do not get me wrong I love Fritz the Cat. And it was great to see that this old school piece of nostalgia was available for purchase on a DVD format. But as for the play-ability of these movies, it was nothing short of a huge letdown. I attempted to play these DVD's on a standard player, my Xbox 360, and a PS2. All came up with the same error. Regional restriction. After carefully looking at the case I found that the website for the publisher was www.arrowfilms.co.uk. Now after talking to some friends i found out i actually need a DVD player from the UK in order to watch these movies. Even though the info on this page under regions says: All Regions. So just a warning, if you live in america these DVD's will not play on your standard player."
3,I was the 70s,"Hi, it was the 70s when i saw Fritz the Cat and lets say the it was the times to get high,and thats how long ago when i saw it.its an ok film alittle to long and i jsut got bored of it.Thx. anyway for haveing it."
1,False advertising - This doesn't play all regions,Couldn't get it to play. My DVD player saids it's incompatible with the region. Have to buy an all region DVD player now just to watch this.
5,The 509th Remembered,Bought for my husband who likes World War II movies and books. Saw this on Educational TV and was interested in getting this book. A nice book to add to his collection.
5,Heroes Not Villians,"The author painstaking has anecdotes from aircrews, ground personnel, and other people that fleshes out the whole story of the 509th, a courageous group of men, many of who had completed combat tours in the Pacific and Europe but volunteered anyway. Photographs galore from private collections. This really tells the story of the MEN of the 509th without any academic revisionism."
3,"Disappointed in ""Universal Remote""","Spent about a month researching different home theater systems searching for one with DVD, VHS, and a universal remote to keep the number of remotes down. Thought this system had everything I wanted, but I'm disappointed in their ""Universal Remote"". It only works with about a dozen TVs and, of course, not the TV we have. The Panasonic web site is worthless. It won't produce anything other than the Operating Instruction Manual. There's no way to track down cross reference codes. This system is better than what we had before, but I think the ""Universal Remote"" claim could be false advertising."
4,nice but complicated,"I like the sound and the unit looks good. I haven't figured out how to route the TV sound through the VCR. And when I put on a DVD, the sound is mostly from the rear speakers. Any help would be appreciated."
5,German Cancer therapies,"This book is very specific about several therapies currently used in other countries, but NOT in North America. The therapy itself, HOW it is administered, specific products used, etc. Also included are names, addresses, contact info for Drs. using these therapies in places close to the USA.I found the book extremely helpful, interesting and complete."
4,That's the whole point!,"One reviewer wrote she was disturbed that Dar Williams used the words ""work makes you free"" in her song Empire. Holy Cow! That's the whole bloody point for goodness sake. It boggles the mind that this pointed, but fairly obvious, bit of irony could escape anyone sentient enough to be interested in Dar Wiliams in the first place. Empire is a great song and puts Ms. Williams right up there with Steve Earle as a truth teller. Maybe there should be an IQ test before you're allowed to buy the album; but then again this is America and Ms. Williams has to eat."
4,a tad bit dissapointed.,"I LOVE Dar. I've been only listening to her for a year or so, and I got Mortal City and The Honesty Room a while ago. I decided to pick up My Better Self, just to see one of her newer albums, and it wasn't as good as I hoped. Maybe I was just wanting it to be more like the others, but this cd didn't seem to have as much spirit in the singing, it blended together more and did not seem to have as much of Dar's quirkyness in it as well as her deeper side. It was still pretty good (I mean, it is Dar) but still not as much the the other cds I have."
2,Not up to Dar,"I too am hugely fond of her music, but in my view this isn't one of Dar Williams' better efforts.It just doesn't have the original and lyrical music we've come to expect, great music like ""The Christians and the Pagans,"" ""End of the Summer,"" ""Spring Street,"" etc. The final track--a live version of ""And a God Descended"" from ""The Green World""--only painfully emphasizes how tepid the preceding music is.That she covers two songs--""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere"" and ""Comfortably Numb""--suggests that her songbook wasn't exactly brimming this time out. I don't get including the music of Pink Floyd, as vapid and unoriginal a group as ever there was. (Ok, ok, I heard her say in concert that she chose ""Comfortably Numb"" in reaction to last year's re-election of You Know Who, but the selection is still too much of a stretch.) Covering Frank Zappa's work, perhaps ""I'm the Slime,"" would have been just as apropos."
3,Not Up to Par,"I have all of Dar's CDs and My Better Self is not one of my favoirtes. As Johnathan said, it is not as folky, and she doesn't use falsetto nearly as much as I would like. I don't like her whinier voice. Also, as she admits, this album doesn't have many metaphors, which makes it boring. The songs aren't as original as I'd expected. She tries to be blues on Two Sides of the River, but in my opinion, it just doesn't work for her. My favorites are Teen for God (much like her earlier folky stuff) her cover of Comfortably Numb with Ani Difranco, Liar, Echoes, and Hudson. The album seems to get better as it plays."
4,One of Dar's best.,"From top to bottom this is a very solid CD and deserves a spot up there with ""Mortal City"" and her other best material. I liked the duet cover of ""Comfortably Numb."" The highlight for me on this disc though is the lead off song ""Teen for God.""If you like Dar's music this will not dissappoint, if you are new to her...this might be a good launch point for you because of the album's pop-oriented sound."
1,Scientifically Inaccurate,"This episode ""Lost in Space"" claims Pluto is a planet. The scientific community would beg to differ. Don't feed your children this filth."
5,Ms Frizzle still doesn't disappoint!!,"I loved this series as a child. Now I'm experiencing it through my daughters eyes. I learned a lot with these shows and watching them again I realize I'd seen them all!! Great videos, great memories, great learning experience!!"
5,love it!,I absolutely love the Magic School Bus and have been looking for these at a reasonable price for years! I have already used several of the episodes for my science class and plan to use more!
5,We love these!,"My 6 year old has always been a fan of the books and science kits, we had no idea there were also videos! Heard about these from a coworker; very educational and entertaining. They are not in HD, so the picture on a large screen is a bit fuzzy; something we adults notice, kids probably do not."
5,Love this Complete Collection!,I grew up watching The Magic School Bus and now my 4 year old son loves it too! This complete series is a great buy!
5,Amazing Product,"I'm a first grade teacher, and I swear by these videos. They are a great addition to my science curriculum, and make science relatable to children.This was an outstanding deal!!!!"
5,Brings back memories,"First of all I loved The Magic School Bus as a child, my family consisted of a lot of teachers and educational movies were a must. Watching this with my kids was great, they were so interested and wanted to watch one right after another.The quality of the picture is not that great but my kids didn't seem to care, so i don't find that a big issue. Overall my kids enjoyed them and that's all that matters to me!!"
5,Great show!,I bought this for my son to watch. He loves educational shows/movies. He has learned a lot watching this show!
5,Absolutely love it!,"I ordered this as a gift. My children saw it and well suffice to say- the gift became theirs! They love it so much, and I am thrilled at how educational it is! My 3 & 6year old were having a discussion at Christmas about how to make a chemical reaction verses a physical reaction. Family members stood there astonished, and I had one ""proud mama"" moment! Thanks to this series."
3,Where is the sound?,"I love these episodes and just ordered them for my class. Recieved them today and discovered that besides the dialogue there is no noise. Sounds funny without the background noise (water in the rapids, opening song, etc.) Will be sending them back and hoping it is only a defect with my set!"
4,For young scientists,I really liked how quickly the package arrived. The box came undamaged and everything was packed well. I have already gotten use out of the videos to reinforce my science lessons with my students.
5,Homerun with 6 year old and even the 3 year old watches,"It was looked at with heavy doubt that my 6 year old would even watch, but after my persistance to watch one show he is now hooked and half-way through the series. My 3 year old even looks entertained watching it by big brothers side."
5,WOW,"Talk about a throw back. Classic Episodes for a relative whose just getting into the science and ""Why"" stage of his life."
4,Fun and educational!,"My three kids all loved this series. We've owned the book seriess for a long time but they never really caught my kids' attention. Watching DVDs is completely different. My kids were fascinated and could watch episode after episode until we ordered them to stop. To be honest, I was hoping the animation quality to be higher and the dialog to be closer to the books. But my kids don't seem to complain one bit. They all loved it. I think this is the best Christmas present they've got so far."
5,Kids love it,"Get series, great price. My son watches one every night. Very educational Im glad there are fun science videos for young kids"
5,Magic School Bus--Great Series!,Great series! I've been buying the VHS tapes and DVD's little by little over the past few years. It's great to get the complete series in DVD form for such a great price! Wish it'd been available sooner.
5,great deal!,This is a great deal on a wonderful series! It came neatly packaged and the booklet inside is informative giving a small overview of each episode! Another great buy from Amazon!
5,Love it!,Such a great deal for every single episode!! My five year old has watched about five hours straight - riveted - which says a lot given that she is miserable with the flu. The Magic Schoolbus is saving Christmas!
5,exploration time,"will be wonderful in young school classrooms as well as grandchildren, makes learning fun. hours of entertaining to prepare meals or fold clothes"
4,very educational,My daughter loves the magical school bus...she stays during the whole program...she simply loves it. she has watched this dvd more than 3 times.
5,Just like I remember,"I always loved this show when I was growing up. I purchased this for a Christmas present for my 6 year old. She loves these just as much as I did. This show is very educational and at the end of each episode they correct any inaccurate information in a fun way, I strongly recommend this show to anyone with young children. I love watching these with my daughter."
5,Great for Homeschooling Parents,"We are homeschooling our almost 6 yr old who already LOVED The Magic School Bus! Amazon was running an awesome deal on it for Christmas, so we got this set for a steal!The box set has a very nice presentation and I appreciate that there is box for all the individually packaged DVDs to fit in to so we can keep them together easier.These are perfect for homeschooling families because each individual DVD tells you the name of the episode and the topic discussed in the episode. So if you are doing a Unit Study on the Human Body (for example) you can easily find the episodes that specifically deal the human body and let your kids watch that show during the week. Not only are the very educational and accurate, it's a really fun way to supplement your Homeschool Curriculum!"
1,More fun than oppressing your neighbors in real life!!,"Roadblocks in the streets, spying on fellow citizens, Big Brother surveillance, martial law... Everything a boot-licking American could ask for!This game is great if you want to condition yourself or your child for a future in law enforcement.If you confiscate enough private property you can unlock ""PATRIOT ACT MODE"", where you can see through walls and perform sneak & peek searches of residential homes.Burn enough constitutions and you can access secret levels where you are tasked with relocating people into Internment Camps!! SUPER FUN!!But watch out for your nemisis, Congressman Ron Paul. He stands in the way of your mission!When America becomes a prison camp, YOU WIN!!"
4,Just getting started with this one...........,"And my one complaint so far is that the manual is lacking in important information, such as specifically how to go about searching a vehicle at a checkpoint. Also, you don't get much of a budget to work with during the game - by the time you have your compound built, you're almost broke, and once your budget is gone, game over. Graphics are decent, has the potential of being fun for those who are against illegal aliens."
2,Low on your list of priorities,"OK, it's the Dead, and anything Dead is good, as far as I'm concerned. Having said that, if you're looking into some Dead, there are many better choices of Hornsby shows where Jerry plays off him with emotion. Vince is harsh throughout and ham-handed on his solos. Energy is really uneven on the CD, which was the thing that got me off the bus - too few peaks. If Hornsby is the reason to buy this CD, as it was for me, keep looking and save yourself the waiting. Some of those RFK shows with Hornsby were really great - look for a good tape of them!"
2,Do not even think about it!!!,"I posted a review of this last year, believing that this a paltry show at best, but it was never posted? I thought OK maybe I'll go back and ""re-review"" it. After listening again, I uphold my opinion: this collection is crap!!!There are 3 CDs. The first starts of with some good energy. CD 2 is the better of this bad show. Samson>>IKO>>Looks Like Rain>>Jam, but not at all worth the price. As for CD 3, forget there is even a CD #3...it's that bad!Minuses: The collective efforts of Bruce and Vince. Jerry's thin vocals. The midi orcestration(too much). Any track with Vince singing. A bad version of Morning Dew? (yes even Morning Dew was caught in the fray of this terrible collection)Pluses: Cold Rain and Snow sounds ok, and a semi-nice Feels Like Rain. (I'm being quite generous.)"
2,A Notch Under Blah,"Garcia swings from completely lost to ""barely cutting it,"" while the keyboards - yet again - ruin an otherwise decent-sounding recording. Nothing much worth hearing; stick with Summer '89 & prior."
3,Road Trips MSG 1990 (2.1?) MUCH better,"While this isnt terrible, only Standing on the Moon really calls out for listening from my crowded Dead collection . Many, many other releases to get before this one. Steppin' Out; DP 31; DP 12; DP 5; DP 36; DP 28; most of the Road Trips especially ""Wall of Sound"" form 1974, on and on...As for 1990 Vince/Bruce Hornsby shows- The Road Trips from MSG 1990 (the same run of shows as this) is FAR superior and actually one of my overall favorites as well. This one is at the bottom however!!!! IF ITS NOT A LIVING BABY, THEN YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT !!!"
3,High Energy With Harsh vocals,"The real story on this CD is Phil Lesh. The bass player in any band is always over looked and under appreciated. Phil plays the 6 string bass and the bottom end is the deepest I ever heard from any bass player. Plus he is playing all over the place, he stands out not only from a tonal aspect, but also from the amount ot notes he plays. He's Gone and the MSG Jam is by far the high lite. Here we have Phil letting loose with a great improv. jam with The two Keyboard players. This is very unique. The down side here is Jerry's vocals. while Heart felt and full of passion,they are rough and harsh. The sound that comes from Vince's keyboard is also unpleasent. This is the irony of the CD. Morning Dew has Phil pumping and Jerry rippin' But the vocals are really rough here. If you love the Dead do not miss this one. If you are a fan of fine vocals pass on it."
3,The song that woman sung was...,"As I read these reviews I am astonished to find that nobody mentions the excellent version of Stagger Lee. Listen to it. Overall this disk is obviously not the best installment of the Dick's Picks series, but there are fine renditions of many songs. The only complaint that I have about this set is Vince Welneck...his style is unimpressive and his playing sounds eerily similar to a bad church choir ( e.g. Queen Jane). The shows highs outweight its lows, if only by a little. If you are a fan of the Dead, you will more than likely enjoy these disks. Just watch of for Vince and listen to the Staggar Lee for God's sake!"
4,"good music, so-so sound","Well, once you get past the first cd, it's great. The 1st cd is plagued by low mixing and mediocre music. The only cut performed up to par on cd 1 is queen jane. If you're looking for an introduction to 90's dead, go to dozin' at the knick first, and come to this for the jams. Lunatic Preserve is one of the 3 most interesting jams in any dicks pick. all and all, really worth the money."
3,It's Russian,"I love Baroque. I have a Baroque collection and was piqued when I found ""Russian"" Baroque. Well..it's Russian. It's dry, drab and nearly flavorless but does have enough interesting tones that I won't let it gather dust on the shelf. It's Russian and reflects the tenor and tone of its time."
3,"""Fuses"" means at LEAST 2!","I'm sure that this is a decent product and all, I dono, I haven't installed it yet (It just got here) But I can tell you that when you read ""DB Link ANL250 250 Amp ANL Fuses"" and you think that because it says ""FUSE(S)"" you will receive more than one, you are wrong. Thats what I thought until I opened the box and saw that it is actually a SINGLE package containing ONE fuse."
1,What a piece of junk!,"We bought two of these for family reunion fun, but the fun didn't show. One boat never made it to the water because it deflated quickly. The other one stayed inflated, but the black patches on the side must have retained heat from the sun and became soft because it bulged and looked like it would pop at any moment. One of the oars broke with normal use. The one bright spot was the pump. It was small but worked fast. For the price this was very thin plastic and a total bust. Thank goodness the dealer took them back with no problems."
5,NEW FISHING TACKLE ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES,"This book was the best book on antique fishing tackle. It has been expanded into 3 volumes and so is an even better book now. The 1st Volume , Plugs (ISBN# 09634515-6-1)is 352 color pages of Plugs. The 2nd (Volume Reel, Spoons & Spinners (ISBN# 09634515-7-X) is 352 color pages of Reels and metal lures. The 3rd Volume, Flyrod Baits, Rods, Misc. (ISBN# 09634515-8-8) is 368 color pages of Rods, Flyrod Baits, boats, motors, tackleboxes etc, etc, of everything related to fishing tackle. All books are hard cover."
1,pass on this one,"Interesting book to read but recipes are complicated, time consuming and if that's not enough the 3 we tested tasted horrible. Food for little fingers is a much better book for both toddlers and youngsters."
5,Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding,"This study is by a Barnard College professor that I heard lecture at the China Institute in New York City. The traditional Chinese cultural custom of deforming women's feet to make them smaller, resulting in pain, deformity, and disability, is no longer practiced. But it is a complex and controversial subject involving, among other things, sex, social status, and feminism. For me the value of this book is the author's focus on the perspectives of women who experienced, continued, and even promoted the practice, highlighting their views on it's costs and benefits. It's a useful counterpoint and a rich resource."
3,ok book but kindle version missing some things...,"i enjoyed reading the book, but wish the kindle version [which is what i have] had the following: clickable footnotes, pagination and the illustrations listed - i've looked on EVERY page, & there are NO illustrations, even though there's a list of them in the table of contents... which states they follow page 138. however, you can't go to a page of this version [you can in most kindle books], & when i finally determined what the page numbers were, the last page listed [found via my kindle for mac app] was page 76 - which would make it difficult to go to page 138, wouldn't it?topic is interesting, writing engaging, few typos [often an issue w/kindle books], so worth the read, but i feel like i was cheated of the full experience of this book."
1,ZERO STAR,"I had to give it 1 star to be able to continue the review but it deserved nothing. This was unreadable. It might be readable by someone who likes to read facts ad nauseum. And I kept reading for a couple of chapters mistakingly thinking that it would somewhow turn into something of interest...no such luck. Don't waste your money like I did. You would get a better perspective of this practice if you read ""The Binding Chair"" by Kathryn Harrison."
4,Also attracts dogs.,"We adopted a new dog into the house and I was concerned that my cranky old lady cat would stress out and do a little vengeful rug soiling. I'm already a fan of Dr. Elsey's litters, so I decided to try the Cat Attract and see if it would head off disaster. Well, it works. My cat went in her litter box every time (she expressed her outrage in other ways). Thing is, the dog started going there as well. As long as the Cat Attract was in the litter box, we couldn't get him to stop. So, yeah. The product works. This might also be useful if you needs something to potty train a dog, but in a mixed pet household you might experience some side effects."
2,Doesn't work,"I chose this product because I have an old cat with dementia and he sometimes forgets what the litter box is for. He will walk up to the litter box and sometimes use it and sometimes stand outside the box and use the floor beside the litter box.I thought that this would work with the attractant in the litter. This is no difference between lesser brands and this brand. Very expensive, $15.00 for 14 lbs.I would not recommend this to any of my friends."
5,I loved this book,"If your want to start a dream journal, this is a great book. It is small enough to take anywhere. He also uses real people's dreams to illistrate different exercises and ideas which really helped me understand my own dreams better."
1,Poor workmanship,"I was very happy with a front wheel that I purchased earlier from Niagara for about the same price as this rear wheel. When I bought this rear wheel, I thought I was buying a matching rear wheel to the front that I had purchased earlier. However, the quality of this rear wheel is terrible compared to the front wheel. The front wheel had a low cost Shimano hub that spun glass smooth with very little resistance. This rear wheel has a lot of drag when one tries to spin it, to the point where one has to make sure that one has a fairly tight grip on the hub so that it does not spin with the wheel. In addition, the wheel is visibly out of round. Not much but, enough to be irritating.I can't believe the difference in quality between the front wheel that I bought and this rear wheel. Both cost under $30 each."
4,"Disturbing, but rightly so","Very disturbing, but I love Suzan-Lori Parks' style. I read in a book she wrote that she believes that ""history is time that won't quit,"" and that's very evident in this play, and makes it so interesting."
3,good suggestions,this book is full of suggestions to help with the pains and symptoms of fibro - I found it very helpful
4,Nice size for 1 or 2,I am enjoying using this little slow cooker. It's great for 2 people. The bigger ones aren't always conveint for a couple. It has been doing a good job for us.
5,I'm very pleased,"I bought this slow cooker for my camper, but tried it out at home first. I think I'm going to have to order another for the camper because I'm going to keep this one at home. It holds more than I thought it would. It is a perfect size for us, since it is just my husband and I. It is also the only small one that I found with the different settings. I use the keep warm setting alot. I would like to find a cookbook for it that would modify existing crockpot recipes to use in this size. Until then, I will experiment on my own."
5,Becoming Charlemagne,Jeff Sypeck's book integrates histories that are too often treated as distinct. He writes with the imagery of a novel but hues to the objectives of non-fiction. The book is both lively and informative.
4,well researched!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i agree with the previous reviewer. its a well made documentary on the history of latin music.one thing however, that struck me as a bit erronous. in the ""Salsa Revolution"" segment, they mentioned that Masucci sold the label in 1980, thats not quite true, Fania in the 80's expirienced a reccession during that period. because alot of musicians complained about the questionable accounting practices along with the competition with Merengue which contributed to the decline of Salsa. Fania was still around but the label did not fall until the early 90's let alone no longer dominant in the latin music genre."
4,pretty awesome,so im into this band dungen. and i had a hankerin for some more face melting psych rock. my bff told me about sun dial. sun dial delivered the face melt.
1,One of the worst books I ever read!,"I have read many of Mr.Patterson's books and have really enjoyed them. However ""Escape The Night"" was absolutely unbearable. The story was unbelievable and the characters were confusing and completely unlikeable. I don't know what the author was thinking when he wrote this book. I just hope Peter Carey doesn't show up again. I'd take a book about Tony Lord or Chris Padgett any day over this book's wooden hero."
2,This must have been written on a bad Tuesday.,"Not one of RNP's best works. Really slow and tedious. Peter Carey never became a real person to me. Story just plodded along. If Peter had edited this book himself, he would have left about 50 usable pages. Leave Peter Carey alone and give me more Tony Lord or Chris Padgett."
2,A chore to plod thru.,"I have enjoyed RNP's legal thrillers and looked forward to this one. However, my disappointment matches that of the other reviewers.I had to assign myself fifty pages a day to complete this one. In a word it was a task. Confusing, way too dark, no sympathetic characters, boring and tedious.Mr. Patterson is capable of much better, so I kept reading hoping for the enjoyment to begin...it never happened for me. I was just relieved to finish.Someone once told me that ""life is too short for a bad book."" I think he had this book in mind."
2,UNBELIEVABLE!,"I've read a number of RNP's books and went back to pick this one up-If I didn't know better I would have sworn it was written by someone else. Hard to follow, and the charecters are totally unbelievable. Too many bad guys trying to be worse than the other."
4,Escape the night by reading this book!,"Peter Carey has demons in his mind, preventing him from dealing with the family owned firm, his girlfriend, the death of his parents. The demons take on very twisted images in his nightmares and the problems are exacerbated by real demons from his past---men who will stop at nothing to prevent Peter from learning the truth. My only complaint was the constant shifting of focus--it became hard to tell one character's thoughts and actions from another. The ending of the book was written almost in screenplay form. It should be a dynamite movie! Just please don't anyone let Demi Moore play Noelle?!"
2,Two Stars Only for Ending,"This book had an interesting and complicated plot but the writing was often confusing and, in my opinion did not flow. The ending was exciting but to read 270 slow pages before it grabs you is not worth the time. I have read 5 other novels by this author that I really enjoyed. This one is definitely the weakest."
4,Escape the Night,loved the book-once I started it I could not put it down until I finished it-would recommend this to my friends
1,Very Pretty! And Worthless!,"JUNK! Had to replace 2 hex screws with the corect size! Will not tighten up to post had to use spacers. Still came lose tightened again and busted right in half.. Very pretty though.. Just keep it on the work bench or a shelf for all to see, As this was not ment to be USED!! Oh"" and did I mention its pretty??"
2,Not Metra,"I was not sent Metra terminals, they were a different brand which is disconcerting as I wanted to purchase the terminal covers for them and do not know where to find them or if they are made for this brand."
5,Excellent,"Excellent finish, excellent attention to details.Now takes pride of place among my collection. Nothing less would have been expected from AutoArt."
5,good,This item worked very well for our needs and the price was really good. The variety of adapters was also good.
4,Good bike,"The bike came on time and it was easy to put the tires on, etc.I bought a different brand for my other daughter, and comparing them, there is really no difference.Both are heavier than I would like, but I havent found a lighter bike that has these features.I like the expandability, raising the seat and twisting the handle bars to accommodate a growing kid."
4,"Nice little bike, can't get my daughter off","Bought this bike for my 9 year old daughter, she was a liitle overwhelmed at first. This was here first bike with gears and handbrakes. After 2 short trips, she confident and loves it. I had no problem putting the bike together, the handbrake assembly was not very clear in the instructions. But once I figured it out, they were easy to assemble. The only dissappoinment is the location of the water bottle holder. The designers put it on the bottom side of the angled frame support. It gets dirty from the road, especially if it's wet outside. Other than that, it's a great bike for the $."
3,Taggart's Lady,"Beth Anne Taggart has been married to Chaney for as long as she can remember. Beth Anne desperately longs to prove that she can take care of herself. But then, there are the nightmares. Horrible, bloody dreams in which she is calling out for someone named Josey. The premise of this book seems a bit obscure. It seems to be a story of redemption for Chaney and a story of self-discovery for Beth Anne. As much as these stories are intertwined in this 3 1/2 star read, there is a sense of discord which drives a wedge between Beth Anne and Chaney. Nevertheless, the characters are strongly drawn, and Ms. James, it seems, can make any premise appealing. Interesting and well-crafted."
4,nice.,"I bought these as a gift, along with another pair from this seller. These were offered at an extremely low price and when they arrived, they were well worth what I paid. I would recommend these (and this seller)"
2,This book states the obvious without adding much.,"Kudos to Boykin for writing the book, but in all honesty, the work seems written for an audience that is either non-black or black but non-gay. For black gays, most of Boykin's observations will seem obvious, and he doesn't offer much new insight.After a while, books like this grow tiresome and seem almost cynical in their opportunism."
1,"OPPRESSIVE, SEPARATIST, and OFFENSIVE","As an AA, Lesbian Sistah, I found this book to be oppressive, separatist, and offensive. How does Boykin expect to find unity as a black supremacist?"
4,entertaining heated tales,"SEDUCE ME contains twelve short stories with each of these contributions being twenty pages or under and one novella (""At Work"" is 88 pages). The entries are all fast and hot as they range the gamut of erotica. The tales include sex with the same gender (""Sivan""), love ""At Work"", ""Rick"" who loves cleaning his mistress' feet, masturbating (""Letter to a Lover"") and other scenarios from bondage to tonguing. None of the stories go deep (except physically), but fans of the sub-genre will still gain plenty of thrilling pleasure from these entertaining heated tales."
4,Cadet 1605 5 drawer project center,Generally this unit is very good. On complaint on this item was that the locking mechanism did not mount flush to the surface so I ended up putting an O ring behind the looking mechanism to give it a finished look. I would also have preferred one deep drawer with only 4 total drawers (for paint cans.
5,Cetol SRD 005 Natural Oak,"I used 4 gallons of Sikken Cetol SRD on a new PT pine deck that had weathered for 4 months. I did bleach, scrub, wash and rinse, and then let dry for 3 days prior to beginning this project. The results are stunning. The application was painless, but you must keep working a wet area and not jump around or you will see start/stops. I loved the way the product soaked into the wood and water beaded up almost immediately on the finish. The pigments are very iridescent in bright sunlight and really bring out the grain of pressure treated pine. I had used a Cabot Australian Oil product on the ramp and porch of my shop building, also on PT pine, and the Sikken product is far superior in appearance. I don't understand why the Sikken brand is only handled by one dealer within 50 miles of me, but I will not use Behr, Olympic, Cabot, or Sherwin Williams over the Cetol SRD."
4,For wood lovers,"By following the guidelines as stated on the container I have used this product over several years and have been VERY satisfied. Other considerations should be the pitch content of certain woods, i.e. Red Fir, and of course removing the shiny Mill glaze from smooth American limber products. (the rest of the world gets splinters BUT they also receive TRUE dimensional lumber) Moisture content of your material must be a prime concern. If you have the patience and have made the preparation, then this very well researched and prepared product will deliver years of beauty and pride. NO! I wasn't paid to say this. I am a retired carpenter."
4,Okay but patchy wasn't the best!,Bikini Bottom Bash is a good VHS but to me Patchy kind of took the fun out of spongebob that time. My favorite episode is Valintines day because Patrick is pretty mad about a handshack for the holiday.
3,What was ordered,What I received was what I ordered. Wasn't available at my local Home Depot. Cheaper to order here than special order through them.
4,"Great album for King's X fans, but buy Gretchen first!","As a big King's X fan, I love this album. I discover something new every time I listen to it, but it isn't the album a new listener should buy first. The single"" It's Love"" I'm sure drew in new fans, but the rest of the album is so unconventional that it is misleading. Don't you just love the riffs in ""We were born to be loved""? Make no mistake that this is a great album, but buy ""Gretchen goes to Nebraska"" (their finest album to date) first."
3,disappointing after two masterpieces,"After the masterpieces that were the first two albums comes this rather disappointing effort, which unfortunately hasn't stood the test of time. Though this is still worth having for the superb first four tracks and yet another brilliant ballad in 'everywhere i go'. The remaining tracks no longer inspire."
4,Emotionally And Musically Powerful,"I'm always asking myself whether this album or Gretchen Goes to Nebraska is my favorite. It would have to be a tie. I've always had an immense respect for this album. The songwriting, emotion and musicianship are top-notch. King's X has always delivered great backing vocals also. ""It's Love,"" ""Moanjam,"" and ""Legal Kill"" are my personal favorite songs. The production is good also. I remember seeing them on tour in support of this album December 1990; it was excellent and the best concert I've ever attended. Their live sound was great. A totally recommended album."
5,A Terrific Hard Rocking Christian tinged album,"King's X would later repudiate the Christian label, but at this point in their career, their songs were definitely being influenced by a higher power, both musically and lyrically. ""We are Finding Who We Are"" is a great song of self-discovery,"" the closing acoustic ballad ""Legal Kill"" is the best anti-abortion song ever recorded by anyone, and ""Mr. Wilson"" is a beautiful example of ELO influenced pop-rock. ""Moanjam: functions as a good example of power praise rock - ""I sing this song because of You - You're the story - It's You!""But this review would be incomplete without mentioning the band's Beatlesque sounding vocal harmonies, as evidenced on ""It's Love"" and ""I Can't Help,"" and the title track, where the band proclaims ""I believe that He is alive!""Get this album if you can find it, it rocks!"
3,Not bad,Not one of their best but average for a great 3 piece band very few know about. Best song on the disk is # 2 It's Love. This is what Kings X is all about to me.
4,X-tremely good.,"This is a disc I actually only got recently because I remembered liking the song ""It's Love"" in 1990. It's indeed a catchy track, and the rest here holds up for the most part. I tend to think of this band as metal, but they're really more just hard rock. I'm sure many would disagree, but alot of these songs remind me of both Living Colour and Extreme. I like those bands myself. Other stand-out songs for me are ""I'll Never Get Tired Of You"", ""Mr. Wilson"", ""Six Broken Soldiers"", and ""I Can't Help It"". The rest is still decent. Overall if you like melodic hard rock, this is well worth the price, especially used."
3,"Great Music, Skittery Discs","This boxed set is a great collection, but I had trouble with skitter on a number of tracks. iTunes error correction corrected most of the issues except for the Shakedown Street disc. Maybe I just got a bad copy."
4,Duplication for many heads but very worthwhile to others,"This collection of the studio releases post-Warner Brothers years is a very worthwhile addition to any music collector but maybe not to all Deadheads. Most heads probably have most if not all the albums..so why get it? As with other GD releases, all the filler material the folks in Novato squeeze in is great. Ok, how many different versions of a song do you need? As many as they'll release! Seriously, the filler is excellent, the repackaging job is very nice, and there is some great liner notes. A high recommendation, not five stars since I had most of the albums already but very worthwhile."
2,Professional Heavy Backpack,I purchased the backpack and thought the many compartments would be great. However there is not as much room for documents and folders and I thought. The padding is great for laptop protection. The backpack is very heavy and hurts my back when carrying through an airport.The style and look is good function is poor.
5,"A breath of optimisim in pessimistic ""alternative pop""","When is someone going to sign these guys? Their clever lyrics and enthusiasm puts those annoying diddies we are bombarded with on the radio to shame! Listeners can identify with their songs and not be ashamed to turn Johny Vegas up loud and sing along. These guys are one of the best kept secrets in music right now- but with albums like ""Super Cool"", I am sure that they won't be a secret for long."
4,awesome,Johny Vegas has improved since its inception at SUNY Oswego. I miss seeing thaem weekly at Old City. I wish they could play local venue in the Hudson Valley in NY. I would go all the time.
3,love of books,"Disappointed as I did know it was a textbook (perhaps I did not look clasely enough) however, it is in excellent condition, no scribbled on! Still happy about the purchase!"
1,Why write a new book? Just change the title!,This book is exactly the same book - verbatim - as Myles Munroe's The Purpose and Power of God's Glory. I wouldn't have bought this book if I had known it was the exact copy I already owned (with a different cover and title). I've lost a little respect for Mr. Munroe for misleading his faithful readers like this.
4,Very good!,Great book for anyone that's looking to grow spiritually. Dr. M. Munroe explains it step by step on how to enjoy the glory of living.
3,Lacks Detail for specific models,"I fully agree with the earlier reviewer. This book covers to many models and lacks the details for any specific model. I ended up buying the Hayes Manual which I find much more usefull for my 1988 Trooper II 4 Cyl. My advice is to buy the Hayes and if u still have money to spare then buy this one as a second reference. The Hayes book is also much cheaper btw, < $15 ."
3,Covers too many models,This book covers to many models to be of reall use to one specific model. I have a 1988 Trooper II with a four cylinder engine and found the Hayes Manual much better not to mention cheaper.
3,Strongly Feminist,"Very interesting points, but a little too strong for my blood. I think if a woman wants to stay home, that's her decision. It's not the right choice for me, but no one can make that decision for anyone else."
1,"Rude, vague, and a danger to society","I thought that the feminist's motto was that a woman could do it better than a man - then why is she complaining about women having to do housework? Miss Hirshman thinks that raising childen is a lowly job, yet those girls in daycare are the women of tomorrow. Who is going to teach them what they need to succeed - the dumb babysitter?This woman is angry, rude and vague during interviews. She will not answer anyone who questions her, only snaps that they need to ""hush"" and listen to what she is saying (which is only contradicting herself).I know that bad publicity is better than good, but this woman is dangerous to our society. I would rather stay home than have to work with a bitter, angry, family-hating woman like her, or the co-workers that she is trying to create.Please do not support her!"
1,Typical socialist feminist pushy nonsense,"We've had 4 decades of feminism being crammed down our throats and some of us young women are smart enough to vomit it back up.I wasted my early 20s getting an engineering degree because I bought into these fear tactics. The truth is, if it wasn't for the feminists pushing for the ridiculous no-fault divorce laws and encouraging women to be as undesirable and masculine(sleeping around unmarried, looking down on housework and cooking, being pushy and dominant in areas they should have left for the guys, etc) as possible has increased the divorce rate. Before the feminists took a stranglehold on the legal system it was only 5%.This isn't good policy for normal mothers or their children. It is good for the elitist, over educated, feminists socialists who would have us all work in slavery to their new world matriarchal order."
1,I wish I could give a -5 star rating,"I am a professional woman and my husband stays home with our children because we're willing to make the financial sacrifice to ensure that our children are raised by their parents not some daycare center.I heard an interview with this woman on Michael Medved and her tone is just totally snotty, judgmental and altogether nasty and condescending. This woman is so off base when she says women are ""burdened"" by the chore of child-rearing and housekeeping. For those women who think that the blessing of having children is a chore or a burden...then do your potential neglected children a favor and DONT HAVE CHILDREN!!!DONT BUY THIS BOOK...she's advocating the further deterioration of the family which can explain the problems of our society."
1,"It's simple. It's called ""Stay Single"".","This is a great guide if you want to know how to end up divorced and have your children hate you in 18 years. No person, male or female, can possibly be this selfish and keep their family dynamic healthy and in tact. I can understand the author's point of view, but, last I checked, no one is forcing women to get married and reproduce. If you want to be wrapped up in a career and ignore all else around you, then stay single. Pure and simple."
1,Not worthy of a single star.,"Couldn't believe the venom this woman had for successful women who chose to leave their career for something they deemed more important: Motherhood. She demeans any woman that chooses to stay home to nurture and raise her children.After hearing an interview she did about the book, and listening to the contempt in her voice when speaking about women who choose a life different from hers, it was not difficult to predict the same attitude would appear in her little red book.I browsed through the book and found it as worthless as the garbage she spewed during her interview. Don't waste your money on this trash."
1,This Is Man Hating Nutbaggery,"Having seen her "" interview "" on The Colbert Report, its clear that this "" writer "" is such a control freak that she insists ondefining womanhood for ALL women, which is simply insane. Neither men nor women are monoliths, and she also shows a shocking ignorance of men and women, in being ignorant of why men aren't stay at home spouses. Dr. Warren Farrell's excellent"" The Myth Of Male Power "" explains this and many other failures of Hirshman's nutbaggery, so her failure to be minimally aware ofsuch fine works is appalling for someone claiming to write above the kindergarten level.BTW, the reason is "" women don't marry men who don't work "".Statistically speaking, thats accurate. Thats why there are volumes of books on how to snag a rich man, and none on how to snag a rich woman."
1,How sad,"I don't understand people who believe that you should have children only to hand them off to others to be raised. If you want to work full time, then don't have children. Don't fool yourself to think it's ok to do both. Your children deserve all of you, not just the hours in between your job.As for the title...I AM WORKING. I work 24/7. I'm raising 4 children, homeschooling them and preparing them for this world. I hope all those who read this book realize how very warped our society has become..."
3,"Good for money, but use common sense","This is a good table for the money.Please realize, as the other reviewers did not, that you are hopping onto something that is going to flip you upside down. You NEED to have someone help you when it is used for the first time in order to ensure it is adjusted to your heigh/weight. Once you get it adjusted, it is very simple to use and transitions very smoothly.I gave three stars due to poor instruction for initial adjusting (see other reviews) and the need for better padding on the feet. If you use this for more than 2-3 minutes, you will need to wrap your feet in towels or pads to prevent them from getting sore very quickly.This is a good table, if you want better pads & instructions please spend the extra $200 for the nicer units. If you can live with poor initial instruction and the need to add padding, this is a great deal."
4,Quality Product,"The table is a high quality product. Easy to assemble, although if you have your own tools it will be easier than the included tools. I had to add a 2 foot long by 1"" bar (I used a closet rod of steel) with cable tie straps so I could add 20 lbs. of weight to the feet end so I could flip back up. This process was easy and now it works great! As someone else mentioned, it IS still rough on the ankles, in spite of what seems to be quality and very cushioning padding. (Of course, I weigh 220 lbs.!) I am pleased with it, though I recommend the alterations I describe here. e me if u have questions."
5,The Best Grandparent Journal I've Seen!!!,"I'm so impressed with this gift book. I purchased others for friends when this was temporarily out of stock, and they just don't compare with the impressiveness of this book and album! This is truly a keepsake, and I look forward to my parents filling it out for my son!"
3,Good but didn't do it!,"I bought this book for both sets of grandparents and while it is a beautiful book with lots of space for info, neither set of grandparents actually filled it out. My son is now three and they haven't even started. I'd go with a video tape session for an hour as a keepsake instead."
5,Its one of tim allens best,My wife and I really like this film and i highly recommend it for everyone. I was renting it and decided to buy one for myself
4,A nice picture with my idol,"A really nice picture. I loved it, I enjoyed it very much.I am a Tim Allen's huge fan and he is adorable in this film. I hope to have another Allen's film soon."
3,a good family film,"Tim Allen gives a good spazaz to Joe in this movie that makes it funny. Jim Belushi is great as the person who trains Joe in the ways of self defense. cute and not so crude like most comedys which crudeness ans sickness makes it downfall, but y'all enjoy Allen. for fans of the tool man and Belushi"
3,"NOT TIM'S BEST,BUT GOOD","It's been a while sence I saw this movie,but it deserves a bit better ratting then it's getting here. It's a feel good movie at the end.The ending caught me off gaurd the first time around(2veiws).Tim's plays a nice guy who just doesn't fit in,but tries too. He gets into a fight over a parking space with the corp-bully.In front of his daughter and co -workers he's made the fool.Too redeam himself he challenges the bully to a rematch.With this challenge comes popularity & karate lessons.He goes from defferent too one of the crowed.In the end he must choice who he wants too be .The old Joe his family and true freinds like-or the new Joe who the false freinds like.One thing i remember liking about this movie is the way they make fun of product ads ,bye putting a huge list of side effects on the t.v commercials."
4,Surprisingly enjoyable,"For me, this movie was just going to be a Saturday afternoon time-killer, but it turned out to be a little more thoughtful and enjoyable than I had anticipated. I'm not the biggest Tim Allen fan in the world, but I thought he was quite good. I thought Jim Belushi was well-cast, and the girl who played Tim Allen's daughter was adorable and a very good little actress. All in all, worth a rental."
1,no shipment,I have not received this product. It was due no later than 30 March 2009 and is now 9 days late. It has been a month since I ordered this product so I suppose it is not going to come. Have already paid for it with my VISA purchase.I do not rank this as a place of business I would recommend to anyone.jerrycv
1,Not a Family Movie,This movie is rated PG and should be PG-13. Would have been a great family movie and story without all the terrible language. I wish I knew how bad it was before I wasted my money on a movie my kids will never see again.
3,REMATCH WANTED!!!,"The bypassed, insecure, and newly divorced Joe Scheffer (Tim Allen) ends up being humiliated in front of his daughter in his company's parking lot by the big bully Mark McKinney. This event drives Joe into a deep depression, until his company sends their counselor to see him. She asks him what he wants, which results in Joe realizing that he wants a rematch. The rematch idea has a domino effect where his coworkers exponentially take notice of him and it increases his self-confidence with the help of a has-been martial art star, Chuck Scarett (James Belushi). Joe Somebody is an entertaining and amusing comedy regarding the daily adversities that people face."
5,Excellent Book for age 9 & Up!,"This book is very well written, and gives you a taste of what it was like to be in the Viet Nam War. I really enjoyed it, and will have my 9 year old read it also. I would recommend all of the ""My Name is America"", and ""Dear America"" books. They are excellent history books!"
5,A Good Book,I think this book is good and sad too. I like it because it has fighting characters. The main character goes to war. He writes a journal about the war. His dad wanted him to write the journal. I would recommend this book because it has action.
2,Words on War,"Patrick Flaherty, a USMC soldier, records his life as a Marine in the hell of Vietnam. His journal explains the duties and hardships of Marines, and how they fight for our freedom.I myself felt that I was with his platoon in the thick war-torn jungles in which they fought. I recommend this book to people with tough stomachs and people who love suspenceful stories."
4,The Journal of Patrick Seamus Flaherty Review,The caricters name is Patrick. Patrick turn down three football scallerships and then he signed up for being a vollenter soldier. A few weeks after the war started Patrick was sent to Vietnam. There he had to sigh a lot of contracts.Patrick hated the army .So when someone in the army got ambust the whole platoon had to go out and help the peaple. one night the peaple in the army where able to shoot all the wapons.One time Patrick had to push a piot in to a treanch. When he did inwas badly brused then was sent to Chairly Hospital. He hated the hospital but when he got back he was able to go home.I like the book becouse I like advencher and I like adventure. the age group is 10 and up.
1,Fact or Fiction?,"Having not yet read the book, the sample pages leave me to question if this is a historical novel as this is not stated. The companies of 3dBn 26thMar were I, K, L, M, and H&S. G (Golf) would have been part of the 2dBn 26th Mar."
2,So sad as the Sunbeam Legacy ends for this cook/baker.,It is not good for cake mixes. I had the model 2349 Heritage Series Legacy edition of this mixer and paid almost $300 for it. First it had screws and nuts that held the bottom of the beaters together and one came off without me knowing and a friend almost broke a tooth. Really embarrasing. Wrote company and they did send new beaters. Then I tried to make a dense cake batter for a birthday cake and it over heated and had to cool down before I could continue. Now today the beaters just quit turning completely and will not turn again. It is not like I overuse this unit. Until I retired 2 years ago I diid not use it much. Just last year I got back to cake decorating once or twice a year. My trusty GE hand beater had to take over today. My mother always had sunbeam and I thought this would be reliable and dependable for $300. Boy was I wrong!
1,Just watch it fall apart,"I hope that this is the poorest quality mixer on the market. I have had it for a couple of years and frequently repair it. If I ever have to buy a part, I will throw it away first. When anyone else in the house uses it, I make sure I am around as they will be calling me about one problem or another. Even parts that do work, do not work well. The motor tilt button is very difficult to push. I pops out easy enough but getting it to release the motor is another story. The bowl table is lose and is grinding itself into little bits of black plastic on the base. The mixing action leaves pockets of ingredients on the bottom as well as the sides. If you have even though about buying this mixer, DON'T."
1,Plastic gears,We also bought the Sunbeam Mixmaster based on previous experience. It is unfortunate that the new products have sacrificed quality for cost. The drive gears for the beaters are now plastic and do not hold up to moderate load (Marshmallow Creme frosting??!??). I found that it stripped the teeth right off the head of the beater drive sleeve when I investigated. Of course I cannot find the parts to repair.The wife and I are now going to go for quality instead of this low-cost alternative.
2,Will not last.,Sunbeam 2350 Heritage Stand Mixer WhiteMy Sunbeam Heritage died yesterday. I felt I had to do a review on it to help those that might make the same mistake. When I got the mixer 1 year ago I was very happy with it. It was half the price of a kitchenaid. It had good weight and the motor sounded great. The first probelm I had was the base jumping which by the way looks metal but is made of plastic. Then where the mixer hinges got loose which would cause the arm with the motor to bounce. Even with the weight it was not heavy enough if I was mixing bread dough or even frosting it would jump all over the counter. Yesterday my whatever turns the mixers (not the technical term) got off so they cannot turn. It's now an expensive paperweight. I highly reccomend just biting the bullet and buying the more expensive kitchenaid. That is what I will do next time. That is unless you only need a mixer for a year or less. Good luck to you!
2,Piece of Junk,"I bought this mixure primarily for Dough recipes but it just simply won't handle that... If I put the mixer on high # 3 knead it shuts off after about 15 minutes of use. Additionally, the knob in the back has completely come loose so as the mixer is ""mixing"" the speed varies up and down so you have to tape it or keep re-adjusting. I just bought a Kitchen Aid Pro 6 series can't wait to get it!!! P.S. it has the most messed up dough hook out of all the mixers I've seen. Plus it is too light the the mixer moves around A LOT!"
1,Can do better by hand!!,"I wanted a stand mixer to mix bread dough. I saw this on sale and it looked really sturdy and usefull. Looks are deceiving! The recipe called for egg whites that were frothy- the beaters didn't reach to the bottom of the bowl to do this, used my hand mixer. Then when adding the flour mix the motor started to slow down and really pull after 1/4 the total flour. When I tried to change the speed of the mixer nothing happened. I'm pretty sure I can do better with by hand than this mixer does. The bowl and beaters were supposed to turn together--only if you turn the bowl and use a scraper does the batter eventually mix up.I took mine back after 1 try and will look for something that will actually mix."
1,Don't buy this Mixer!,"I bought this mixer because I had owned a Sunbeam stand mixer that worked like a champ for 21 years. It is obvious that the quality of Sunbeam's newer offerings is lacking. This mixer started to have problems after just one year of use. The motor would died out during mixing. Resetting the dial would get it to start up again, so I just dealt with it. However, now it is totally unusable as it is stuck and will not tilt back, so the beaters can not be inserted. I feel ripped off, because I thought I was buying a quality product, based on my past experience with Sunbeam!"
1,Don't knead bread dough with this mixer,"This review is for a Sunbeam 2350 mixer. I used this mixer to knead bread dough, and it failed in less than five minutes. The gears are stripped, and the mixer no longer works for anything. This happened with a single loaf recipe and normal dough consistency, which leaves me wondering why the manufacturer included dough hooks with the mixer. In my opinion, for what this mixer does (or did, when it was working), a $20 hand held mixer would be easier to use, and would take one-fourth the storage room."
5,I loved this book!,"Being an Oklahoman, the main character resonated with me. At the time, I was in a violent relationship and this novel seemed to release some of the anger I had had being a victim of domestic violence. Although I don't condemn violence, some things are beyond mere mortal laws -- some things need vengeance and the Universe and Powers that Be are aligned. The heroine is applauded in my opinion for taking something that was stolen and making things as fair as they can be on her level.Just because things are not in the perfect world, neither are we. There are times that one has to play by another's rules/game to simply survive; physically and psychologically."
3,Adequate for the Wizard of Oz Play,Hat is too small for even a young child. Adequate for use in a school play or for one night of trick or treating. Recommend the user wear an undershirt and tights or other similar well-fitting garment underneath for added comfort since arm/bodice seams are uncomfortable otherwise.
2,Costume is not true to size,I ordered this costume for my 6 year old and he could barely move in it. The head piece was so small it had to be for an infant. The only good thing about this costume is that it looks like the picture.
1,crappiest costume on the planet.,This was the worst costume I have ever seen in person. It looks nothing like the photo and the material is sooooo horrible. The strings to tie the neck even arrived broken. Don't bother with this tin man costume.
1,Wrong Size Tin Man Head,"We do a family theme every year for Halloween, this year it will be Wizard of Oz. Received this costume for my oldest son (age 10) today, we have been very anxious to receive. I opened it up and while the body part of the costume is amazing, the head part of the costume will not even fit on my 3 year olds head. Think there has been some sort of mix up on this."
3,Tin Man Halloween costume,"I ordered this for my son who is four for a Halloween costume,it's cute the bottom part fits well and is cute for a costume, the head piece though is a little tight because my son has a very big head lol. It will be too small next year so this is a one time only Halloween costume but for the event its fine , I just wish the ax and the heart would have come with the outfit."
1,This product is GARBAGE.,"This tin man suit came significantly larger than the size indicated (I ordered the 12-14) and the tin man hat was too small for an infant to wear--it would have barely fit a small poodle. Very poor quality. If I could give it a negative number of stars, I would"
3,Just like others have said...,"The headpiece on this costume is too small. My son is 3.5 yrs old. Wears a 5t jammie, 4t clothes. He's skinny and tall. He even has a small head! But for some reason this headpiece is way too small. He complained about it and refused to ""buckle"" the velcro that holds it under the chin all night. Doesn't come with the axe, also known as, ""the knife is missing, daddy."" Only has one clasp at the top of the back near the neck, which left him feeling exposed, I ended up safety pinning a spot."
3,Tin Man,"The Tin Man costume is a decent representation of the character from the Wizard of Oz but like most costumes it is made of flimsy material and poorly stitched. I would much rather pay a little more for a costume made of cotton, with real stitching and made durable. The synthetic material the costumes are made of make the kids sweat terribly.Won't anyone produce a well made costume??"
5,Great intro to the e-guitar,"I've played acoustic guitar for a long time. This tape helped me to make a rapid and smooth transition to the electric guitar. Developing good technique is emphasized, but not overdone. The lessons are fun and I was surprised with how powerful even a little knowledge about shuffles and power chords can be on the electric guitar. If you know how to play acoustic and want an inexpensive, quality intro to the e-guitar, then you'll enjoy this tape."
4,Power Pop Masterpiece,"Wow. What to say about the most under-appreciated pop record of all time? Third Eye should have made these guys big stars, and then... grunge. Despite bad timing, there really isn't a bad tune here. Highlights are ""Shonen Knife"", ""Zira(Call Out My Name)"", ""Where I Am Today"", and ""Spirit of 76"" - the latter having loads of great references to '70's pop culture. In fact, the whole album plays like the soundtrack to that oh-so-excellent roadtrip to the beach... sounding best when played full blast with windows open, screaming down the highway in a late '70's GTO or Camaro. Totally bitchin'!!"
5,"Must have for ""Annie's Gone"" alone","This album turned Redd Kross on their head. While it's not my favorite album of theirs (that would be ""Phaseshifter""), the songs tread the line between bubblegum (literally in ""Bubblegum Factory"") and rock so well it has to be heard to understand. Tragically, history has made Redd Kross one of those bands that your favorite bands all listened to (and ripped off) and not the one we all had a chance to enjoy. Grab this, grab ""Phaseshifter"", grab ""Neurotica"", and get with a band that grew up making rock great."
5,"Subtle, painful and hilarious, Christopher Guest-style","It's definitely not for everyone, but fans of Christopher Guest's ""Waiting for Guffman"" and the Australian classic ""The Castle"" will totally appreciate the painfully real humor of this irony-deficient couple trying to organize their brand of fun. Not only are the performances spot-on, but the camerawork makes it a classic comic masterpiece. I busted out laughing multiple times as the camera lingered over a fellow camper's shoes as she crawls out of her tent, or Candace Marie standing atop a cliff as Keith, below, shouts up facts about limestone that she can't hear. Priceless, true-to-life portrayals of insufferable, humorless control freaks that we've all had the misfortune of being ""entertained"" by, or the greater misfortune of camping with."
4,A wonderful little book by a pioneer of Bee Venom Therapy!,"This little book by Charles Mraz, (93 when he wrote the book), of Middlebury, Vermont, is a great introduction to the use of Bee Venom Therapy (BVT) in the treatment of arthritis, M.S. and other auto-immune diseases. Mr. Mraz began using BVT over 60 years ago, and has helped thousands of people, including myself, free of charge. In fact, what little he may make from the publication of this book is the only financial reward he has received from helping so many. The book is a personal account, not overly scientific, very readable. In fact, it may want for a bit more of his vast, albeit un-credentialed, medical knowledge. If you are the least bit interested in BVT for yourself or loved one, but maybe thinking it sounds absolutely crazy, (as I first did!), this book just might ease your fears and give you hope. Charles Mraz claims it works. I can tell you, he's right!"
3,"Not for all special needs situations, but helpful","The methods in this book detail considerable sacrifice of parents time and resources devoted to one child; in a multiple child or two-working parent household, this would not be as beneficial and produce results as claimed from Floor Time program. Also, there are many types of special needs children with needs not addressed in this book. While overall helpful and a must-read for involved parents, continue seeking assistance from local programs and teachers/therapists, and use this as one small part of your reading list. This book does not address all the needs of all special needs children, but it is helpful and gives detailed explanations and plans to begin with. We have four special needs children with four separate diagnoses, so we are not first time parents, nor is this book the definitive program or resource for any of the four. Read it, try it, then continue researching and resourcing!"
5,Highly Recommended!,"This book was a real difference maker for us in our quest to find the right diagnosis and the right treatment for our little guy. It's not a super easy read, but it's got tons of great insights."
4,Helpful,"This book is quite helpful for people who are interested in knowing more about autism and other developmental disorders. Autism is a treatable disorder whose symptons can be dramatically reduced with proper intervention. This book goes a long way in explaining autism and various developmental activities that will help children overcome autism.On occasion ""pschological"" language makes certain passages a bit difficult to understand. But overall a useful, well written book."
4,All Parents Should Check This Out,"As a step parent, some of this info is a bit slow paced and detailed for stepping into the real thing. Luckily the other half knows :) All parents should check out this info as it pertains to all growing children"
5,Great resource for parents and professionals,"I have been using sensory integration therapy, and other occupational therapy approaches, to help children with learning and behavioral problems. The book have given me great resource to give the children and their parent better and more joyful relationship. ( which is every child and parents right ) I find out that the book helps me in giving the best ""soft ware programs"" to children whose brain ""wiring"" have been improved by sensory integration therapy. I have been very concerned to see young children being given psychotropic drugs ( or being deprived of many kind of food ), so the guidlines on observing many aspects of a child's behavior before and while taking any drug or any diet is very useful. Many of my patients, are now free of drugs and troublesome diet, thanks to Dr.Greenspan !"
3,Engaging Autism is better,"After our son was diagnosed with developmental delay, this was the first book I read. It was helpful, but since he was subsequently diagnosed with ASD a few weeks later, I read Greenspan's other book (Engaging Autism) and found it to be more detailed. The jargon is somewhat difficult to follow at times, and it seems as though both books could be shortened by about 200 pages without much loss of information. I feel obliged to write that the best book about helping your child with ASD that I've found so far is ""More Than Words"" by Fern Sussman. It has almost all of Greenspan's points in an easy-to-read, illustrated ""how-to"" format. You can also order it from the North Carolina Autism Society bookstore's website for less than half of Amazon's price. (Hopefully the Amazon people won't delete this review now!) Good luck."
3,Interesting BUT...,"Greenspan's method of Floor Time is quite interesting and certainly a nice way to relate to a normal functioning child. What is problematic is that it is a very, very weak approach for an autistic child. Following his lead is really off the mark - very likely he doesn't even know you are there. It feels like a general approach that was just hastily adapted towards autism since that's where alot of need is."
5,Right on the mark for my child,"Early in the book Dr. Greenspan described 3 components typically involved in develomentally delayed children: sensory input, sensory processing, and motor planning. This was the first time I had seen in print a description of exactly what seemed to be affecting my son. We have never had a diagnosis for him so I also appreciate that the book does not get bogged down in labelling a child. The developmental path that he suggests a child must follow gave us a fairly clear ""map"" to follow. Excellent book."
3,So far so good,"The local leather shop closed down about a year ago, so I need to go online for those products.I am a XL to XXL helmet when I ride. This does NOT fit my head the best. It seems incorrectly sized. Most head wraps are one size fits all, be it cotton, or other material. They will fit me no problem. This one isn't quite right.It looked like they spent a lot in the marketing tag with a thin skin of leather on each side, and THICK heavy duty material it was mounted on. The weight made it feel like wood at first when unpacking it.So far no problem with the quality and stitching. I'd suggest buying products like this at a store so you can verify if it'll work on your melon on not."
3,Flimsy,"While it does a good job of organizing my shoes, this organizer is pretty cheaply made. The dividers are made of cardboard, and I'm afraid that one of my heels is going rip through the canvas. (But this hasn't happened yet) Also, it's a lot bigger than it looks.On the plus side, if you have small feet, you can fit 24 pairs of shoes, not 12.Overall, you get what you pay for."
3,Footnotes Not Included,"I bought the Recovery Version New Testament 2-3 years ago and was pleased to find out that the Old Testament translation was soon to be published as well. I assumed there would be footnote and study pages for the Old Testament version as there had been for the New Testament. When I received my Bible, I was disappointed to find out that there are no footnotes at all for either the old or new testaments. While the translation itself is fine, it was the notes and comments that made me ""think outside the box"" of my faith. Witness Lee has a unique way of describing Bible passages and making me see in a fresh and different way. I gave this review 3 stars because without the notes and comments, I find the translation to be equal to any of the other excellent translations out there, but not better."
4,One of the most accurate translation,This is one of the most accurate tranlation of the Bible. It is also written in a clear and easy to understand manner. Footnotes can be very helpful but they are only one man's opinion.
2,Missing footnotes?!,"To really understand the Recovery Version of the Bible, you should get a version which includes the complete commentary/footnotes by False Witness Lee. See what a man who declared himself to be the special 'Minister of the Age', chosen by Almighty God as the only man on earth to reveal His vision in our times, has done to pervert the Gospel of Jesus Christ."
5,A really accurate Bible version,"I really recommend this Bible to all Christians. This Bible is the most accurate version compared with the others. It also contains outline in every book of the Bible, which is helpful for understanding.I also recommend the New Testament Bible (Recovery Version) published by the Living Stream Ministry."
4,Great background music,"This is a really nice little album if you are trying to create a carribean feel without lyrics getting in the way. It's not great album to listen to, but if you are sipping on a boat drink while reading ""A Salty Piece of Land"", this adds great background music."
5,This is a classic!,This has spawned imitators. Zelazny has obviously borrowed ideas from this work. It is a joy to read. I recommend this book.
5,INSPIRING AND TOUCHING,I received this book as a gift and couldn't put it down once I began reading. The story was very touching and has inspired me. I truly recommend this book.
3,Not what I expected....,"I'm sure as I listen to it I'll start to like it more. But unfortunately, it was a bit too light for me. I like darker, more industrial sounds and that's what I was hoping to find. I won't say this is a bad cd, but had I gotten a chance to listen to it prior to buying I probably would have passed this up in favor of another cd."
4,In depth view of mr. mojo's mind,"While not his greatest book of poetry, The American Night gives the reader a sense of awe at the workings of Mr. Mojo's mind. Anyone interested in off-the-beaten-path poetry and Jim Morrison in general should read this book."
4,"With music, these words are incredible","Though this is a great book of poetry, and definately written by one of the greatest poets of our time, there is a better way to experience these words. There is an album out, you can get it on CD, and most stores have it. Its called ""American Prayer"" by Jim morrison. It is all these poems spoken by jim morrison with doors music set behind it. If you like Jim's poetry, and the music of the doors, you'll play this album over and over and over until you've memorized all the poems yourself. Its great. and trippy, too."
1,An Abject Failure As Art,"Morrison wrote rafts of ""poetry,"" but when it was published in his own lifetime, he had to pay good money for the privelege. This volume demonstrates why. The song lyrics included are worthwhile but lack any depth without the wraparound effect of the music. The poetry contained herein is derivative of Ginsberg and Kerouac without capturing the meaning or depth those two towering greats injected into deceptively simple words. Morrison did most of his writing drunk -- sometimes strung out on yohimbe -- and you can tell. Like most ""artists"" who write or compose under the influence of chemicals, he thought he was greater than the finished product shows he actually was. Morrison once promised to abjure all art except his music, and we would all have been richly rewarded if he had done so and stuck with his strengths."
1,Targus Wireless Web Card - HP Jornada and SprintPCS Samsung,"Unfortunately I do not know if the HP PDA or the Targus Card is at fault. I can not get support from Targus, HP or Sprint to help get connected with this device. I can dial-up, however the connection never goes through. Its been 6 months now and I have not been able to get this resolved. Its very frustrating and disappointing."
3,Northern Lights,"Better than most ""New Age"" offerings, thanks to the overall choices and imagery the music conjures up. Northbound is first cut and gives actual feel of travelling very fast over snow and ice. Sounds like a well-crafted soundtrack. Well worth buying when you need a beautiful, lilting symphonic head-journey-or when you just need/want to hear musicians other than U.S./British-born artists.Some of the cuts are quite moving, some sturm und drang, and others reminiscent of the best of classical artists. One friend told me he could almost hear the ice crackling underfoot in one track, and another said he thought of the time he saw flights of geese southbound for the winter."
3,"2 Stars for the Album, 5 stars for Urmus Sisak's Work","I heard Dominus Vobiscum on XM radio this morning and found myself just sitting down and meditating on the spot. Meditation is something I've started reading about but could not see myself doing though I knew I'd try somehow. Music like this makes meditation possible for anyone even those with totally undisciplined minds like mine. I've listened to the samples, and I'll buy this album but only for the 3 pieces by Urmus Sisak. He'll never know what this experience meant to me. One note: I only remembered the name ""Sisak"" and the word ""Contemplation"" and began my determined search for this music. Given that he is a composer and part of a compilation from various artists, what do you think the chances should have been that I would find his Dominus Vobiscum with that little information? His name never came up in a search. It must be true that if you are sincere, doors or paths do open. Just listen..."
2,"""It makes me think of tubular bells by Mike Oldfield""","""Music composed by Sisask is classical but added with a touch of symphonical rock. It was the feast of recognising when I listend to compositions like the forest. I only hope that Sisask does not go to far into the forest of early rock and roll"""
4,Good hardcore street stuff,"For those that didn't know or who don't care this is a true story on what happened in the various wards after the flood water receeded. There was an influx of drug gangs that moved into New Orleans for control of the drug traffic, these gangs where mostly Mexican who came to the area looking for work but also brought these gangs. Not to mention the gangs that had already taken hold prior to the flood, I felt that Val Kilmer and Curtis Jackson aka 50 cents did convincing performances as cops battling these dealers.I saw nothing fake not really your basic drug dealer vs police movie lots of side stories and hardcore street stuff will keep your attention I give this 4 stars."
2,Disappointing,"Streets of Blood starts out promising enough, as it tells the tale of two cops (Val Kilmer and Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) in a post-Hurricane Katrina landscape trying to regain control of the drug underworld they police. Coming off as more of an uncensored episode of any prime-time TV cop drama than a real crime saga, Streets of Blood features plenty of shaky camerawork, and even shakier accents. As much as I love Val Kilmer, he's just so stale here, and the fact that his accent keeps changing up doesn't help matters either. Sharon Stone is more than guilty of this as well, as 50 Cent ends up putting in the best performance of the whole show here. Still, Streets of Blood manages to be oddly compelling for most of its running time despite its many flaws, and I guess that in itself makes it at least worth a look for fans of Kilmer or gritty cop dramas."
1,Fat Val Is a Cajun,Fat Val gets a payday and stoops to working with bucktoothed non acting Fitty Cent. Sharon Stone still looks good but doesn't have much to do. This movie is really crappy. The story of corruption in New Orleans and the post Katrina atmosphere would be a good backdrop for a story but this is garbage.
2,"Ok, but lacking.",This video seemed to be lacking in the most sensitive areas. It needed to be improved before it was made public.
4,old dude digs preteen,"WWI vet returned home with deep scars and considered ending his life. Then he met his housekeepers' 12-year-old niece and, struck by her beauty and innocence, found a new reason to live. Her very presence is his salvation. They became friends, but she begins to notice boys and her own new-found sexuality. This is less a story driven film than a study in our human need for love and purpose.A possible eyeraiser is casting an actual 12-yr-old (stunning Katya Berger) as the child. Dispite the subject matter, this film is not lewd. There is one brief scene with Ms. Berger topless. Unfortunately, the 77 minutes of running time goes by too fast and we want to see more of her."
1,Cut Verison!,Don't even bother buying the cut verison of this movie. Do some internet searching and you can find the full-length one for sale (legally -grin).
1,There should be a zero rating for trash like this...,There does not need to be anything said about this DVD except it has horrible video quality and any nudity that might have been in the original film has been edited out for this version.Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
5,don't know what your having?,"If you don't know what you're having, I highly recommend this collection. We're not finding out what were having this time around (we have 2 boys) and found this collection at Babies R Us when I was picking up some other items (didn't even know Babies R Us had bedding of this caliber). The soft yellows and greens are perfect. I'm a little concerned about the blue (in case we have a girl) but love this set so much that we're going to get it anyways. If we do have a girl, I'll just put in some pink stuffed animals and other accessories."
2,VERY POOR QUALITY wait til you see it in person,I was very disappointed with this crib set and the Vintage Teaberry set. The quality of the materials (fabric) is very poor. The blankets are small and the crib sheets are coarse. Do not buy these unless you like them in person-- they look great online but are quite different in person. They are very overpriced for the low quality. It is not the quality of the OLD wendy b. products.
2,Not worth the price,"This bedding looks cheaply made, the chenile is the worst thing ever, the blanket is ugly, and the stars on the pillow and the pillow of the truck bedding are uneven! And yet it costs $300! Someone explain this to me? No other bedding at Babies R Us comes close to this price, yet this one is not even a good quality. What?Some of the accessories are decent, but why buy them if there is nothing else to match? Not to mention that you'd be spending over $700 if you did buy them all. Maybe if the bedding was worth it, buts its not.I'd say to anyone, that before you buy this item you need to SEE it up close. The quality leaves a lot to be desired."
2,Just ok - Nothing great,"Its ok, but certainly not worth $300, plus more for accessories. I can get a different set at Babies R Us for $180 with more stuff and the exact same quality fabric. Why would anyone spend that kind of money on bedding, especially when there are other quality choice at the store?"
1,Still Cheap Looking,"Not sure why my review got deleted, but its STILL just a one star item. Its no where near what Wendy used to make, the chenile is horrible, the fabric was already dirty when I saw it, and the price for it is still absurd."
1,Poor Quality,"I was initially attracted to the collection by the neutral tones and the ""Wendy Bellisimo"" name. However, upon examining it in the store I realized the quality was not the same as the previous collections. I have found a very similar, but better quality set from Brandee Danielle. (...) Please do yourself a favor and find Brandee Danielle's Star Bright collection. It is not currently offered by BRU. (...). They actually have a comparison that shows the difference between the quality of the 2 sets. You will be glad when you check it out."
5,was unsure at first,"I was not sure about purchasing this collection after reading several of the reviews on-line but went to the store to look at it myself and was pleasantly surprised. I loved the way the colors look. The blue could be a bit more blue, but I think all the colors blend beautifully together. I purchased this collection along with most of the accessories they had in the store (including the window treatments - which are fantastic)and started to put our nursery together this weekend. I'm really excited about how its all coming together and would definitely recommend this collection to someone who is looking for either a neutral collection or a collection for a boy (we're having our first boy in April)."
4,Love everything (except the price),"For all of you reading, to be clear, we purchased the Starlight bedding. There are a few sets by Wendy Bellisimo and I think this one is the best. We looked everywhere for something without a ""theme"" and that was classy but found nothing until this set. It is not poorly made and the colors are very nice. (We are expecting a girl) The fabric does not feel cheap nor is the stitching uneven and the blanket is SO soft. My only complaint is the price but compared to the other sets we liked, all from boutiques, its not that bad. I am happy to spend an extra $100 to have a designer look."
3,Quality does not fit price,"The starlight crib bedding set is very pretty, but it is not worth the price. I washed it when I first got it and the fabric on the bumpers fell apart quite a bit after just one washing. I'm not impressed with the quality."
2,Disappointed new mom,"I registered for the starlight nursery set because I didn't like any of the cutsie animal sets and I needed a non-gender set. I gave it a lot of thought because it is soo much more expensive than any other set. I am now very sorry that I did. When I registered the coordinating mobile was advertised to arrive in May, (which was perfect because that's when I was due). However, a couple of months later when I went to buy it, I was told that it had been recalled. I had to go out and buy a mobile that doesn't match. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but this was my first child and I had justified the price by saying that each of my children would be able to use it. Now I wish I had gotten a set from Pottery Barn Kids which was actually cheaper and includded all the coordinating pieces."
1,No Bueno!! I mean no good ? Tricked by photos on web,"We are a hispanic family with a limited income, we bought this product online for my sister and her new child. The pictures online were unbelievably gorgous, when my sister called she was so upset with the quality and the product and the price.How could someone charge so much and give so little? That was my weeks pay for somthing we are going to have to return and replacedont companys care anymore about the little people?"
5,accessories galore,I registered for the Starlight crib set and all the coordinating accessories and love everything. I especially love the fact that everything I needed for the nursery was at Babies R Us and how well everything coordinated with this set. It was also fun to mix and match a couple items from the other Wendy Bellissimo collections to really make it my own. 5 stars for the whole collection!
2,Colors & Quality Very Disappointing,"Our baby is due this spring and we aren't finding out the sex. When I saw this bedding online, I thought that it would be perfect! However, when I went to see it in the store, the green gingham was a horrible dark green and the blue chenille was so light, that it almost looked white. I was very disappointed in the colors and the quality of the sewing. We opted to not purchased this set. Instead, we went to Pottery Barn Kids and registered for a nicer quality set, for a lower price. Before you buy online, make sure you see this one in person!"
2,Doesn't wear well,"We have the Sir Leapsalot set by Wendy Bellissimo and we LOVED it at first. I'm writing the review here because the comforter is the same as the Starlight set. We washed the comforter as directed and it pilled immediately and looks terrible now. The back of the comforter doesn't seem to fit the front anymore, one side shrunk more than the other. Also, the comforter is a square shape, not a full-size toddler bed comforter as most crib sets include so we cannot use it once we move our baby to a toddler bed. I love the look of our set and the bumpers, curtains, sheets, and bed skirt are fine, but I am terribly disappointed in the comforter. We spent a huge amount of money on this set and I expected it to wear better. Our little one is only 9 months and I've already thrown away the comforter. For the money, it's just not worth it."
2,Do not purchase this until you see it in person ...,"The pictures on this website are not accurate as far as color is concerned. When I actually got to the store and saw the real thing, the blue looks more like a dirty white. The colors are very BLAH. The green is hideous! I wish the green was a little softer and the blue was more vibrant. I quickly changed my mind about purchasing this set (especially considering how expensive it is) and I am going to keep looking."
4,The book was inspiring and informative,This is a must have book for beginner writers who are serious about getting their work published. It has all the basic information you will need and will give you a great boost over others who do not do their homework before writing.
4,It is a place to start,I had already written my book so I was more interested in the Sell part of this book. I found it a great place to start. It gave me information that I didn't previously have or had even thought about.
3,Basic Information,"This book contains many basic do's and don'ts on how to write children's picture books. It gives good advice on staying within a child's reference point, for example, and on how and when to write poetry instead of prose in a picture book. For more detailed information on how to write picture books, see books such as ""Crafting Stories,"" ""Picture Writing,"" or ""An Idiot's Guide to Publishing Children's Books."""
2,This is for the Negative pole on battery,Please note this is not very well marked that it is for the Negative pole on the Battery. Very poor quality but a fair price. I wouldn't buy it again.
4,One of the best 'rock' soundtacks out there.,"Loved the movie and wanted the soundtrack as soon as I walked out of the theatre. So it wasn't long before it plopped itself into my stereo and it really does kick some butt.The production values do vary a touch and there are tunes from a couple of different spectrums of rock music but it all hangs together, amusing snippets of dialogue from the movie helpt break it up and remind you of how much you liked the film, which helps the soundtrack along too.While some of the more known songs on this disc would perhaps take the glory, it must be said that some of the originals that were written for the movie are true to the era and are darn fine too, so you don't have to worry about wading through garbage to find the good bits.For more immediate comparisons, this CD is better than the soundtrack to Rock Star, for instance."
2,Roadrunner by Jonathon Richmond/Richman and the modern lover,In response to previous query this song is not in the track listing and I think it might be Roadrunner by Johnathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. (He also sang songs in There's something about Mary.)
2,Where are all the good songs from the film???,"This album was a big disappointment.I have given it 2 stars, because it certainly does contain some undeniably great rock songs, such as The Immigrant Song. However, having also seen the film, I find myself asking... what about all the other good songs they had??Back in Black, Smoke on the Water, Highway to Hell, just to mention a few, are all used to some extent within the film, and their absence from the soundtrack is a huge let down. These are classic rock songs, done by some of the greatest rock bands of all time such as Deep Purple and AC/DC, and their omission from the CD will be inexcusable for those who have seen the film.Buy it if you want a taste of some classic rock, but there are much better rock compilations available."
4,does anyone know what this song is called:,the song that Jack is singing to himself when the two girls offer him the School of Rock band name? if u find out send me a email at music_kid@hotmail.com
2,New Soundtrack,This movie was great I love it. But this soundtrack is CRAP!!! Whatever happen to the songs that really rocked? 'Highway to Hell'? 'Back in Black'? 'Smoke on the Water'? you know the songs that the kids play. I think there should be a second soundtrack honering the greatist rock songs. Now that would be an album I would buy.
4,"Funny movie, good music","Pretty decent compilation here. In regards to the 'mystery song' in question, I believe you're talking about ""Roadrunner USA"". It was originally sung by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts but I know the Sex Pistols did a cover as well. Hope this helps!"
5,A must for every rock fan!,"If you're a rock fan,like I am,this album is for you. If you saw the film and own it(VHS or DVD),this album is for you. The film's star Jack Black with the kids he worked with in the film recorded a couple of tunes from this album,the title track and IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP. The latter track also featured AC/DC. Black and the kids recorded the songs as SCHOOL OF ROCK. Memorable classic rock tunes from this album include The Doors' 1969 hit TOUCH ME(not heard in the film) and Cream's 1968 hit SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE. However,in one scene of the film,Dewey Finn(Black) and one of the Horace Green Elementary School children,are performing TOUCH ME themselves. Other great rockers are Stevie Nicks' THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN and The Who's SUBSTITUTE. This album contains a few bits of dialogue from the film also. I love HEAL ME,I'M HEARTSICK which is heard in the Battle of the Bands scene. All the other songs are great."
5,Amazing songs,"Definitely buy this soundtrack, but if you like the songs on it, go out and buy the albums those songs are from as well. The highlights are David Bowie, The Who, The Doors, Cream, Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, and The Ramones, so basically everything. I really hope this movie opens up new 'doors of perception' to some narrow-minded teenyboppers and their unlistenable pop stars. I'd love to hear some new bands that sound good."
4,The Song JB Sings When the Girls Present the Band Name,"A few people asked about the song Jack Black sings before the girls show him the School of Rock T-shirt. It is the theme song for Computerman, an online series featuring Jack Black. You can see them at www.channel101.com.Also, regarding the ""Rent/Hardcore"" song, in the DVD commentary, Richard Linkletter says that it wasn't included because Jack Black wrote that song, and he is ""owned elsewhere."" His band, Tenacious D, is signed to Epic Records. I really wish this was on the soundtrack myself."
1,Why no AC/DC performances?,"The film contained references to 4 AC/DC songs, only one of which is on the CD. Clearly, the producers regard AC/DC as the greatest rock band ever, so why not include at least one AC/DC performance on the disc?"
3,If you like this kind of stuff,I did not care for this movie but my husband and older daughters liked it. Depends on if you like the stupid comedy.
4,"Great Movie, Great Soundtrack","This collection really embodies everything the movie is about: Rockin, rockin, and more rockin. There are some great classic rock tracks and the two selections by the School of Rock band are fantastic. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I would have liked some of the songs Jack Black sang throughout the movie to be on the CD (for example, the Math Song). Otherwise, any fan of good, solid rock and roll or anyone who just dug the movie should definitely pick this up."
3,Music from the movie,"I only gave this three stars since I basically purchased this CD for two of the songs it contained. The CD is a compilation of music from the movie. There were only two songs from the movie on the CD that really stood out for me, but my son liked them enough that I was willing to purchase the CD for him. The rest of the CD isn't bad, it's just that the songs didn't stand out enough for me to purchase it if it wasn't for those two songs."
4,"To ""A Music Fan""","Lots of Good songs here... I love the School of Rock songs, can't get them out of my head..That song that is in the movie but not on the album is Roadrunner by The Modern Lovers. This is Jonathan Richman's band from the early to mid 70s. Before he was in There's Something About Mary, you know... This band also included Jerry Harrison, who would later join the Talking Heads, and David Robinson, who was to be The Cars' drummer. Their album should be available here on Amazon as it was reissued by Rhino not to long ago.Also, is it just me, or did they change the name of The Ramones song that appears on this album? This is my favorite Ramones song and I always thought it was called Bonzo Goes to Bitburg....Oh well, still. Get the album,see the movie.Winthrop Fist"
4,"to ""a music fan""","The song you mean is ""chain of fools."" The ""chang chang chang"" is really ""chain chain chain."" It's an old Aretha Franklin song that is often butchered by American Idol contestants...This is a great album. I love the Ramones song ""Bonzo goes to Bitburg."" I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes good rock music."
3,A lot of great rock songs are missing!!,"Where are ""Back In Black"" and ""Highway To Hell"", by AC/DC?? ""Smoke On The Water"" by Deep Purple? ""Iron Man"" by Black Sabbath? Instead of that, the others are in the cd soundtrack, but for you, who are entering the magical world of rock music now, don't forget to get this soundtrack together with another amazing albums, like the ones Jack Black gave to the childrens, Jimi Hendrix ""AXIS BOLD AS LOVE"" that's wonderfull, Pink Floyd ""Dark Side Of The Moon"", that's PERFECT, Yes ""Fragile"", that's a real classic too, and other wonderfull rock albums of only the good old rock'n'roll music! KIDS WANNA ROCK!!!"
1,Freya Stark making a valliant effort,"Most of Freya Stark's books pant with excitement, her adventures transcend even the remotely possible for a tiny woman alone, or nearly alone, in the most hostile settings. Yet Ionia, not really so remote a region, somehow slips into the out-basket. It is boring, the research is forced, the quotes exceed the journalism and while I've had the book on hand for many months and have made many attemps, I just can't finish it. Sorry, Freya."
3,Not my favorite in the series,"I enjoy the series, the characters, and the setting in Excelsior, MN, but this book disappointed me.My first issue was that the parts of the book that involved John's position as a senior associate up for partnership were inconsistent with actual Minneapolis law firm life. I found those inconsistencies very distracting.And I thought the ending/reveal of the real killer too abrupt and incomplete. I didn't feel the author connected the dots between the killer's other crimes and John's murder enough for the murder charges against Goddy to be dropped.Finally, I missed the interaction of the regular customers and wishes there were more times when they met together.Even though I was not especially fond of this book, I do enjoy the series and will continue reading it."
5,Got to Have!!!!,I absolutely love this entire mystery series. This installment of Betsy Devonshire is as exquisite as its forerunners!! A mystery lover's got to have series. You don't have to be a knitter to love these!
3,So-So edition in a good series,"Another installment in the Betsey Devonshire 'Needlecraft Mystery' series. Not my favorite, but worth the read. Betsey's business partner Godwin is suspected of murdering his partner. There are the usual red herrings & I felt it was resolved a little too 'neatly'. But, cozies are for an entertaining easy read & that is what this one did. And you got to know some characters a little better."
3,so many loose threads,"What was the murder victim involved in that led to his death and why exactly was he killed? By the end of the story we are only given guesses, not facts. Did he kick his lover to the curb because he wanted to protect him or because he had fallen out of love? We are never given any insight into what made the murder victim ""tick."""
3,good read,I liked the book and Goddy is my fav character. He is different and to tell the truth he isn't boring like Jill- I mean really lets face it she is a square. I would like to see Betsy get a love life though I mean really she is only in her 50's- I don't like to do needle craft and don't understand it but I sure like these books!
5,ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIES,This movie was fun to watch.I would watch it over again on dvd.It is definitely one of the best comedies ever made.
3,worst farrelly brothers movie ever,"this is a not so great film. 2 hours of just not the farrelly brothers movie i was expecting.i gave it a 3 because the only funny person in it is george from seinfeld. by the way the seinfeld season dvd's better come out, cause if they dont(me shaking my fist). this movie isnt so bad, but really its the type of movie you take your girlfriend to."
3,not the best but not quite that bad either,"when i got this DVD, it thought it would be hilarious. It turns out that Shallow Hal has a few funny parts, but some are insanely boring. The plot was shaky, but Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black were great in this movie."
4,really funny stuff!,"this was a really funny movie.Hal (Jack Black) likes girls just because there pretty. He dosent care if there nice, or caring. He just likes girls for thier looks. So one day, Tony Robbins (himself) and Hal are stuck in an elevator and have a chat. Hal talks about his thing w/ girls and there looks. So Tony, ""hypnotisies"" Hal, so he can see people through there insides. So Hal, could see a pretty girl, when she could be 500 lbs. because its what is inside, not outisde.So one day, Hal sees what he thinks is a pretty girl, named Rosemary (played by Gwenth Patrow), and she's nice and caring and loves Hal. Well, it turns out that Rosemary is prolly the worst person u could date becase she is 400 pounds. Thats whats makes this movie fuuny."
4,You have to look within,"I just finished watching this for the first time and it was good. I'm glad to see a comedy come out of Hollywood which actually had a decent message: You can't always judge a book by its cover, you have to look within. This movie really drives that point home, hence the title ""Shallow Hal"", as in the beginning of the movie Hal is yet another shallow idiot fascinated by appearances, yet ultimately he sees the error to his ways and repents. Good movie."
4,Worth Watching,"The premise of Shallow Hal is based on perceptions of beauty. A rather unattractive guy is intent on pursuing beautiful women, only to be hypnotized into seeing women's inner beauty. Suddenly there are beautiful women everywhere! One beautiful woman actually still appears to be beautiful, but another one looks like the old money-digging hag she truly is. This quite an enjoyable movie with funny moments -- especially the ones in which Gwyneth Paltrow's character keeps breaking chairs. There are a few things in the movie that could be cut, but overall it's worth watching."
3,Not The Worst,"Ok, let me say from the beginning that I am not a huge fan of straight comedy movies. But this is a movie with a message. The message of seeing the inner beauty, and the movies success at getting it across, is the only reason that this flick gets an 3 star rating. As a comedy, if falls, middle of the road, With a few funny moments but overall predictable.The message of this movie is the highlight. It is not whats on the outside but whats on the inside that counts. And this movie follows the path of Hal as he discovers this. A very important message wrapped in a silly film.But any movie that warrents the star power of Gwen Paltrow (in her slim figure and in a fat suit) can ot be totally dismissed. This is a movie that will most appeal to teens or teens at heart, dealing with the peer pressure problem.So, in the long and short of it, don't blow if off to quickly, you may enjoy it."
5,Easy Comedy,"If you want to laugh and watch something without having to think, this is the movie for you. I enjoyed it."
5,Great Movie with a Great Story Line,"Our family are huge fans of Jack Black. The wife had DVR'd this one night a few weeks back, and after watching it, decided to order it so that we could see it without any commercial interruptions. It too is a great movie."
5,shallow hal,"Shallow Hal could be put under the category of ""romantic comedy"" i love how through most of the movie hal thinks a lot of ""unattractive women"" are beautiful, perfect women because he only sees the inside. the ending was really great. i love how gwenyth ends upcarrying out jack instead of vis versa. the point is it keeps you laughing through the whole movie so i definately think that anyone who hasn't seen it should go see it."
5,Great Movie,"Funny, touching and good music! I cried during the scene with the little girl. Jack Black made the movie."
3,Worth the rent but maybe not the buy,"Don't get me wrong, this was a good movie. It just wasn't an outstanding movie. It does qualify as a romantic comedy but the comedy end is perhaps a little weak if you're looking for a roll-on-the-floor laugh-fest. The movie is moderately funny, due in large part to Jason Alexander who I do not remember being billed in the previews. At any rate, I enjoyed this film and do recommend it for viewing. However, I think this is a one-time-view movie that is worth the rent, but perhaps not worthy of putting in the personal collection."
4,Big is beautiful,"I will have to say this movie wasnt all that funny because of the touchy issues of weight and beauty but i will have to say it does get a message across. Especially for those out there that are only oriented on what is on the outside of a person. The most beautiful people in the world arent model thin or model pretty because there personalities are what makes them special. The only part in this movie i wasnt too happy with, was the fact, they make it out that if your big your prone to break everything and your constantly eating. The scenes in which the character Rosemary busted chairs by sitting on them, or the bench at the 4-star restuarant collapsing under her weight... i think they could do with out. Or Rosemary's constant stuffing her face with everything she came across. But once again, the movie was decent and i would recommend seeing it."
2,yeah,"Funny stuff, but I'm a little confused. Was Gwen Paltrow suppose to be the hot chick? And don't you think Jack Black would have noticed the extra girth when they were bumpin' uglies?"
1,it just kept going on and on and an....,"I guess i can't complain too much. I saw this movie for free while I was over seas in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. That was the only good thing about this movie. I love comedies, but this was hardly one. I can recall laughing only a few times throughout the entire movie. It was unrealistic, and hard to believe. The first 10-15 minutes actually decieved me into believing that this might actually turn ou decent, but I was horribly wrong. It seemed to drag on for hours. The plot was dry and predictable, and the acting was mediocre. Too many scenes seemed, well, forced. I applaud the effort to demoralize societies judgment system on ""attractiveness"", but maby they should have put more effort into making a quality film.In summary i would probably never watch this film again unless I was bed-ridden, could not reach the remote and it was playing on TBS some Sunday 5 years down the road...but that wouldn't happen because they actually play good movies on TBS Sunday."
1,"Sorry, I Can't See the Humor Here","Making fun of obesity is hardly cause for laughter.Sorry, I just couldn't get past that"
2,Really not as funny as it could be,"The subject of this movie is meant to be funny, I guess no one thought though that people who are overweight are discriminated against every day as are the ugly people like in the movie.Having said that, all the parts as usual that are funny were shown in the previews, Jack Black does a good job in his role of Hal, and Gweneth Paltrow, although I generally speaking can't stand her does deserve props for putting on that fat suit every day because that had to hurt and be hot.The movie is worth a look, just make sure you arent the one paying to see it, get your friend to!"
3,Couldn't fool me!,"Everyone puts down the Farrelly brothers as gutter-minded boors. And sure, they try to drag this story down from the start. But no matter how many jokes and putdowns they piled on, and no matter how many warnings the critics gave saying this is just a way to mock out fat people, they can't hide the simple niceness of this movie.The message of valuing truth and inner beauty over image and perfection is too hard to conceal. If you have a heart for that sort of thing you'll like this movie no matter what."
3,Shallow Hal is Done Backwards,"I could see that the objective of the film makers was to show how stupid obsession with the outsides is...but I think they could have made the case so much more convincingly if they had the Paltrow part played by an actress who really is obese, and let us, as the audience, fall in love with her as the real person, while only occasionally showing that the Jack Black character sees her as skinny gorgeous Paltrow.Instead they lead us to fall in love with skinny gorgeous Paltrow...and watching her in a fat suit with prosthetics still is not an actual obese woman. At all. In any universe.The Spina Bifida guy was done the way they should have done the Paltrow part (not the actress's fault). He was so amazingly appealing, precisely because he was not fake."
3,"Some funny degrading scenes, otherwise ho-hum!","This movie will probably manage to offend someone in someway, therefore I most give it an extra star for that. Otherwise, it wasn't near as funny as it could be, way too much of a love story ""do the right thing"" movie, and was slow in spots. Very predictable movie."
5,GREATEST OF ALL TIME!,"This was the best movie ever made in the history of movimaking! I think for Jack Black it wasn'tn too groos or it didn't have TOO much crude humor as Jack Black would normally have. The plot was really cute and it was so great. If I were rating this movie I would give it 3because well, I don't have a particular reason for taking a half a star away it just wasn't a four star movie. That's all!"
3,Beauty in the Midst of Stupidity,"I finally decided to watch this movie. It has a good premise and a good ending. The idea of teaching a shallow man how beautiful people really are is a great thing. The problem is that they fill this great plot with tons of fat jokes. Yes, we understand she is heavy, but no one breaks large booth chairs at restaurants! I find things like that offensive. I understand a bit of character development when his friend speaks poorly about Rosemary, but so much of the other jokes is just a cheap way to get a laugh at the expense of people who are heavy. So what they are saying is: You should see people's inner beauty no matter what they weigh, but it is ok to laugh at them for their weight. It doesn't make sense to me."
2,Jack Black and Farrelly fans will be disappointed.,"This movie turns out to be just another romantic comedy with constant fat jokes. I thought Jack Black was hilarious in his other movies, especially High Fidelity, but he has nothing to work with here. The Farrelly Bros. have gone from doing great gross out humor to a sappy romantic plot here with virtually no laughs."
3,One for the lardies.,"Hmm, its rather allegorical and patronising, but its great that the chubbers have a film for them too, because its ok to eat so much you become the size of an ox! If you pay for your own healthcare, go for it! Jack Black is also a salad dodger in real life, and my enjoyment of this film was entirely ruined by the fact that apparently he isnt very nice.Hmm. I love cake."
1,Disapointing,Only a few funny moments...other than that...terrible.Does anyone really like Jack Black???The star is for Gwyneth. :)
2,"Bighearted, but scripty dialog and less-than-convincing acting","It's tempting to give this a high score for the sweet message behind it: you can't judge a book by its cover. I love those type of movies because there's always a sweet surprise in it. Big-hearted.But the acting surprised me. I think it had something to do with a script that didn't handle the message particularly well; of course you know there's a message, and a good one, too, but it has to be worked naturally into the story through events and outcomes, not through scripty, artificial dialog that preaches at the viewer. More effective to charm the audience with warm, likable characters and their weight-related struggles. Maybe the forced, artificial dialog had an impact on the acting. Moreover, they don't need the gratuitous sensuality-this story idea can carry itself just fine without it. With the right dialog.Otherwise, a great message and a big heart."
2,If I'd known it was a Farrelly movie...,"I would have never got it.It's a mix-mash of a movie.You may still enjoy it, but it's almost like 3 movies in 1:1. The comedy - Shallow Hal2. The tasteless comedy - complete with Rhino and Water Buffalo jokes, breaking chairs, and other insults3. The social commentary and heartwarming feel-good romance.Mostly, it's #'s 1 & 2 that don't jive with each other. This isn't a 'straight' comedy, because it's marred with insensitive jokes that COULD have been used just to enhance the feelings at the beginning, but even at the end of the movie they're still throwing them around. It's just a mess of a movie. They add some feel-good commentary, but *other characters* don't act consistently, and when they do stir up more responsible feelings, they let them die under the next rhino joke.Pathetic. If I want low-brow humor, I'll watch a Kevin Smith flick and love it. This was a stinker."
2,Average at best&Dinky Cliches,this film had some alright moments but overall it was just kinda there after a while.it lost it's steam half way through the film&never really recovered.some really lame Cliches.it could have been better.
2,2 stars for the inner message that I saw,"This movie was a big dissapointment to me. I thought that it was absolutely terrible. It was boring, delivered probably 2 laughs but.. This movie wasn't what I expected to see after watching There's Something about Mary and Me, Myself and Irene. This movie was sweet, I guess but just wasn't funny at all. I don't know how to write this review but I just thought that it wasn't funny AT ALL. I actually gave the 2 stars for the inner message I saw in this movie. I thought that what the movie deep down inside was trying to say was that looks don't matter but that how you get along and your friendship with the person you love matters most. But this is a comedy, right? Shouldn't it be funny?"
5,"AH, COME ON LITTLE BABIES, ITS ONLY A MOVIE!","THIS IS FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE THAT ACTUALY TOOK THIS MOVIE SO SERIOUSLY THAT IT OFFENDED THEM, THAT IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY, EVERYONE HAS TO PASS JUDGEMENT ON EVERYTHING, EVEN LITTLE MOVIES, AH ISN'T THAT A SHAME!AND AS FAR AS THIS MOVIE IS CONCERNED, IT RULES!!"
3,Good,Shallow Hal was not what I expected. It was an ok comedy starring Jack Black that finds what he thought to be a hott woman. And blah.
4,"True Love is worth the ""weight""!!!","Jack Black is ""Shallow Hal"", a superficial skirt chaser who, after a mind-altering experience with a self-help guru, doesn't realize that his gorgeous girlfriend is actually a 300-pound not-so-hottie. Meanwhile, Hal's playboy pal Mauricio is determined to break the spell before someone gets...squashed! This movie is packed with loads of laughs and non stop fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedies and a good laugh!!"
4,That new thing called sarcasm,"Men being shallow? That's unheard of! This movie breaks the barriers and covers a subject that no one was ever aware of until now. On a more serious note, if you're going to talk about an issue like the superficiality of judging people strictly by looks, you might as well put a hilarious twist on it. Jack Black superbly portrays a man who is caught up in the physical beauty of women and has a spell put on him so that he will only see women's inner beauty. This obviously leads to side-splitting endeavors as Hal encounters true love for the first time. Gwenyth Paltrow turns in a fabulous performance that is very different from her past roles and George Costanza, wait...I mean Jason Alexander does a great job of playing the concerned ""What are you doing with these horrible women??"" friend. The first time I watched this movie, I was in an awful mood, but I was soon transformed into a fit of laughter with movie quotes that stuck in my head for days."
5,Gallgher's Prose Hits Like an Elegant Brick,"Aileen Gallagher's latest release delivers. Simply put, the magic is there. After becoming hooked with her Walter Peyton portrait, I vowed to follow this energetic writer towards all subjects she deems worthy of reflection by her most elegant mind.With a confident stride, Gallagher walks through the halls of history, detailing a woeful, yet regrettably human episode in our collective history. Steely, reserved, yet unabashed, she sorts through the evidence, presenting all who wish to know with an ample luxury of informational biscuits, warm and tenderly cooked to precisely the right intellectual degree.Kudos to you, Ms. Gallagher.I eagerly await your Muck Raking recollection, and intend to leisurely, studiously savor your forthcoming work on my Chinese Pop Star tour.ever yours, Von Von Von"
3,Bootleg copy,I was honestly shocked when I received this book to see an obvious counterfeit. The book itself was brand new and bound very nicely. But the copy was very low quality and looked as if someone ran the pages through a copy machine and bound them together. The print wasn't even sized properly for the size of the paper. Very strange.
4,Lion's Mane,"Never heard this CD before my purchase; a must for any White Lion fan. I loved the hard rock and lyrics of ""Warsong."" Ck it out!"
2,Average soft heavy metal,"White Lion is one of those hair metal bands everyone make fun of these days. This album is not better or worse than anything else back in the days when the hair was big, the clothes colourful and a cool image necessary to be played on MTV. Mike Tramp has an original voice but sometimes he sounds kinda strange for some reason. The best song is without doubt ""Broken heart"", and when hearing that one you might admit that it wasn't all bad back in the days of hair metal.White Lion fit in the same category as Winger, Ratt, Warrant, Cinderella to name a few. When White Lion called it a day, Mike Tramp formed Freak Of Nature and went for a tougher approach."
5,Leaving With A Bang!,"This was the last White Lion cd! It's really is to bad that they aren't around anymore! But this cd most definatly is one hell of a way to go out rockin'! I myself think this is their best cd they made! With songs like:""Lights & Thunder"", ""Broken Heart"", & of course ""Farwell To You""! This is the best cd to get besides ""The Best Of White Lion""! Worth buying!!!!!!!"
4,A missed opportunity?,"As some have already stated, this is neither a proper greatest hits album nor a true treasure trove of outtakes and alternate cuts. It's a little of both, and while one may be drawn in by the qualities of each, neither truly satisfies; one must fall back on the overall quality of the songs themselves to appreciate this offering.Sadly, there is also a conspicuous absense of live material, but from the looks of it, he has just rereleased his Hollywood album with a second bonus disc of live acoustic tracks. Perhaps they coupled it with the Hollywood album to boost sales, but that bonus disc would have been better served here among his best songs."
5,Bought it for the second time,"This is a good book. It's easy to read and understand, and helps you on your weight loss journey. Thanks."
1,How heavy is this!,"The description says it 999 pounds, the seller is ripping you off! I wouldn't carry 999 pounds in my pocket. Plus, it's less that 2 hours of battery life"
1,Major design flaws!,"I make a lot of candy and needed an accurate themometer. Caramels are especially sensitive to temperature changes. I regret buying this thermometer for two reasons: 1) The base/bulb of the thermometer is at a height that it often isn't fully submerged in the pot.2) Even worse, after my last batch of caramels and the hard candy lollipops were overcooked, I realized that the thermometer is not fixed securely against the number scales, It slides up and down, thereby rendering it quite inaccurate. That was what had happened and what I thought were ""perfect"" temperatures, were actually about 5-10 degrees higher than they should have been. Very frustrating when you are doing something time consuming (with costly ingredients).Unless someone can recommend a better candy thermometer, I guess I'll stick with using two (at the same time) of the store brand themometers. I DO NOT recommend this themometer. High price and seemingly sleek design do not equal quality."
1,Great if you only use it once...,"I made some chips British style... gorgeous with plenty of salt and lashings of vinegar.I attempeted to deep fry again about a week later, and the thermometer wouldn't give me a temperature. Next thing you know, the bulb had broken! How can it break when its sitting in a pan?!?! It was intact when I put it in there and hadn't been knocked about?!"
4,Incomplete Madness,"This CD is not a complete collection of Hits. Prefer the ""Complete Madness"". This is a great compilation."
3,Not the greatest design...,"I bought this clip for my husband, to take on a trip in place of a wallet. The clip is very good - nice spring, but the card side is poorly designed: you have to keep 5-6 cards in it at all times. If you take one out, the rest will fall out as well as there is nothing there to hold them inside. It is also quite large. I was forced to send it back, but got an immediate refund from the seller."
3,Whats the point of this again?,"Although I don't like this, I gave it a ""3"", because anyone can see how big it is. It does work as advertised, although the springs that hold the credit cards in should be a little stronger.SO, if you want a big wide money clip, the corners of which are always poking at you through your pocket, this will work for you. I guess I kind of forgot that the reason I wanted a money clip in the first place was so that the big wad of cash would be soft and unobtrusive."
2,The Trouble Borrower: Brief Comments,"Just finished this book by Giles Lutz, and I have to say this author's done much better work.While it's well written, I thought the plot and characters to be too formulaic.Try ""The Tangled Web"" by Giles Lutz for a better story."
3,Great Bunch of tools with one glaring ommission,"This is a great little kit at a great price, but it needs smaller size torx bits to be able to open up the computers I'm working on - the MacBook hard-drive sled screws, for instance, are one size lower than the smallest in the kit. If those were included, this would be all anyone would need for shifting hard drives in and out and opening up cases.The tools had a better build quality than the $3 set I picked up in Al Ain."
4,Nice little kit.,"I needed a small kit like this for some small computer repairs etc.. Has everything I need and comes in a nice little fold up case. The quality is noticeably not the best but I haven't had an issues yet with light use. For the price, it's definitely worth it."
4,Great toolkit to keep in the car or at the office!,"This toolkit is the perfect set to keep around the office or in the glove compartment. While the tools are not of the highest quality, they will get the job done in a pinch. The carrying case is very compact and the price is right. For medium to heavy-duty jobs I would look for a more substantial set of tools but for those small repairs around the home or office, this set is a great fit.George B."
4,Tri-fold Mini tool kit,I needed small gifts for men and wanted reasonably priced items and the tool kits were very acceptable for both reasons.
3,Okay for Price,"The tool kit has great tools, but some with medium quality (such as the small drivers being a bit flimsy) but my biggest pet peeve for the product is that the contents are extremely hard to get out. The bands that hold the tools are too tight and it is quite hard to get the tools back in. My particular version had yellow colored screwdrivers instead of red and the piers and tweezers positions were switched.Otherwise, I mostly agree with all the other reviews on here."
2,A slender volume of stories with slender plots,"At various points in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes berates Watson for the written versions of his adventures, feeling that Watson has produced sensationalised accounts of what could have been examinations of the deductive process.Possibly Holmes would have been happier with the twelve stories in this slender volume.While the deductions and so forth are fine and well, they generally lack the most important elements of the Holmes stories: human interest and conflict. It is easy to sit back and observe these stories dispassionately, because they lack any passion.The closest Mr. Hammer comes to providing a true continuataion of Doyle's writing is in the last, best and longest of the stories, ""The Matter of the Furnival Curse"". It is in this story that the characters come closest to achieving some semblence of humanity.The book is very well presented, but good packaging doesn't make up for a lack of substantial content."
1,Ways to go to Hell- Really fast!,"Explores the diastrous life of a man who thought he knew it all. His idiocy is illuminated time and time again. His hatred of God is interesting and he, I guarantee you wishes he could do it all over again. Ignore this and read the Bible."
4,an excellent book,"This is really a great book. It has everything a book should have, a good plot, interesting characters (or character, as the case may be), topology, set theory, Hegelianism, and a fight with Goedel. Monk is amazingly good at explaining complicated things but also at getting across to the reader why the complicated things are so important. I should really stop repeating myself, but what is amazing about this book is its marriage of detail and plain good writing. It is a model of how this sort of thing (exposition of ideas) ought to be done. Kudos to Monk for a great book."
2,"A Nabokov fan, disillusioned by this book","Before I first encountered STRONG OPINIONS, I was a Nabokov fan. Reading this collection, however, changed my view of him for good. The man's weird animus against literally hundreds of major authors (Cervantes, Camus, Balzac, Mann, Stendhal, Lorca, Faulkner--you name 'em!) is terribly mean-spirited and small. His attacks on Freud get tiresome, and one begins to wonder if he ever did read much Freud in any depth. He also goes after other leading thinkers and even lets fly against, in his words, ""Einstein's slick formulae"" (I'm really quoting). And his defense of the U.S. war on Vietnam is incredibly ignorant and simplistic, even stupid. Nabokov the artist was a major presence who altered the shape of literature. Nabokov the man, by contrast, was a nasty, dogmatic, narrow-minded little fellow who couldn't countenance any aesthetic but his own.I'm not the only Nabokovophile who has had this ""conversion."" I know several others who've had the same experience."
5,The Best one you would ever see!,I got my Barbie Pet Rescue two days ago ( Friday April 6 and I think it is amasing! I love it! At first I thought it was so boring and I was going to take it back but you know what? I played it longer and I found out more about it and I Lllooovvvveeed it! I can't tell anymore because you haft to buy this first and try it out! But what I can tell you is if you think after you do all of the misins there is nothing els to do but you are rong if you said that there is always things to do like play games and go on the laptop and there is a tun of misens! Please don't turn it down it might be expensiv but it is worth the money!
4,Great Game!,"My daughter can't get enough of this game. The graphics are excellent and there's plenty to do. Just be careful, Mattel's minimum system requirements are way too low. We're running it on an AMD K6-2/350 PC with 64MB of RAM and it gets a little slow changing from screen to screen."
2,Not worth the money!,"This was a Christmas present for my 5 yo Barbie/Pet loving daughter. She adored it. Then she completely solved all the Rescues...the same day! That was it. She played all the little Barbie games in the rescue center, she rescued all the animals, and cleaned them (or whatever it the pet required) and she completely finished in less than 6 hours. Now, she's a bright little girl, but come on, for the money I spent, I'd have sure liked it more if she (A 5 year old!) had gotten more play time out of it. Cute..."
3,Cant play with animals,"The game was fun and all but there were so many missions that you never get to play with the animals. Also, if you get this game, if you're in the playroom, don't bother getting a check-up for the animals, they're never sick."
3,It`s Ok-ish,It`s ok-ish.Barbie just takes about 10 seconds to take a few more steps.And she always says the same things.And it can get boring quickly.
3,EWWW,"Umm, I totally feel like I have no control over Barbie, I mean, it would be wayyyyyyyyyyyy cooler if I could drive the motorcycle (I love driving on comps.). Petting the animals sucks, what's the point, your not even petting them for real! I just don't like this game very much, and the last level I haven't even beat cause I just hated it so much..it's a stupid game and now Barbie is just a stupid doll, she used to be my hero until you suckers ruined it!Good Going Barbie Software!Sincerly dispointed..hope this helps customers!"
3,"Great for most, but not the one I care for","I was surprised by the great reviews on this game, so it must just be me and the five year old I bought it for. I was so excited to buy this game for her. She LOVES animals, especially dogs, and I thought this would be great for her. Unfortunatly she hasn't played it for more than an hour. She finds the hamster maze extremely frustrating, as do I. She wanted to give the golden retriever a bath when she first started but was unable to. She could only bathe the pets she rescued, or so I am told. She was also annoyed that only Stacey could answer the phone for the rescue. She asked how come Barbie couldn't answer it. I give it a three star, because the graphics are really nice and it seemed to have a good story line. It just didn't impress the five year old much. Guess she'll stick to the Putt-Putt games."
5,PERFECT!,"I spend hours playing this game! The graphics still impress me. I feel like I'm actually there playing with the animals! I recomend this for children who love animals and like going on adventures. This is also very educational because it teaches children how to take good care of animals, what to do when an animal is in need, and even more! This is why I think this is the PERFECT game for anyone!"
3,Okay for a rainy day,My mom got me this game for christmas and I loved it. Now that was two yrs ago. Now I only play it when i'm really bored which is like never. One you get all your paw and purr awards it is just the same rescues over and over again.And also the thing that annoys me the most is that you can never keep any parrots once you rescue them. Also how do you know if the turtles were not wild to begin with? On the positive side the puppie kittens and rabbits were so life like. Overall a good game but play only if you are really bored and you need to pass the time.
2,A little repetetive...,"Barbie pet Rescue starts out great, with loads of thigns to do. However, once you get the hang of the game, it gets a little boring. I mean, how many times can one person rescue a kitten/dog/bird/hamster/monkey from the same spot in the same way before it gets old? The game could stand a little more variety."
3,good but not great,when i first got this game i loved it! but after a couple of days it got kinda boring. im not saying its bad but i nots great. ill play it once in a while but il rather play another game. i really wish u could ride her moder bike. also barbie is weird. theyll tell u were to go! its an ok game. i request if u r older than seven do not buy this game. its no a bad game. well thats all i have to say about this game.
2,Good but gets boring after 2 hours,"I got this today. This is how it all goes,1. You get a 5 minute mission to rescue a pet.2. After its rescued, you go to the check up room. IT always says What a healthy girl, I wish it could get sick for onceAnd other stuff that the other reviews have said. I say this game is good for ages 5-8. How childish. And I'm 10. I don't reccomend it much. Even 5-8 year olds will get board!!!!!!"
2,Fun at first.,When I bought barbie pet rescue with my money I thought that it would be realy fun. But I turned out to be wrong. The second day I owend it I realized I had wasted my money. Once you catch All the animals you just catch them All over agian. Another thing is you cant make up your owen name you can onley pick one from the computer. I would onley recomend this game for people whoe are in desprate need of animals.Other whise DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
4,love this game,"my daughter is 10, she don't like barbie, butshe really love this game, she played withit every day for a good while, she really enjoyedgetting calls to rescue different pets"
3,A Different Kind of Classroom : Teaching w/ Dimensions of L,"I really enjoyed the concept that the book was trying to convey, but found the book tedious and difficult to understand. I would definitely need a workshop or class in order to implement the ideas into my classroom."
5,A masterfully woven story,I read Exit Unicorns after Christmas and it is the best book I have read in ages. The poetic flow of her writing is beautiful but the way she weaves the lives of her characters with Ireland's history is truly masterful. Cindy Brandner is a great writer and leaves you loving her characters.
4,The past defining people's minds,"As an European person and non-native English-reader, this book was truly a vast reading experience. The troubles of Northern Ireland have been in the news from time to time in my childhood and youth, still I had no real understanding how serious all this was to common people living in Belfast before reading this book. It's so close to me both geographically and in time.In the book the rich complex story of the Lord Kirkpatrick and the tough, almost laconically written tale of the Riordan brothers is combined by this beautiful young woman Pamela, who has a striking story of her own. The story raises mixed feelings in a reader, and there's nothing simple in any of the main characters.All through the story the secrets of the past whisper and also haunt the characters and at times make things difficult for them as they seek their way of living their life. This is a story of people living their lives at the times of trouble. I recommend the book highly."
5,"Love, Love, Love.......","""Exit Unicorns"" is one of the most beautifully written and heart-tugging books I have ever read. Cindy Brandner weaves a tale with such interesting and complex characters you can't help but fall in love with them. It is so easy to become wrapped up in this multi-faceted tale of love and friendship, intertwined with the history and danger of the time period it takes place in. Love, Love, Love....."
5,Fantastic Introduction to the Irish Troubles! Love this book!,"When I started this book, I had no point of reference in regards to the Irish Troubles. Ms. Brandner's book not only opened my eyes, it gave me a love for a country and people who have, in spite of their struggles, never given up.Exit Unicorns is a romantic tale through which Ms. Brandner weaves the history and culture of Ireland. With the unique character perspectives of Casey, Jamie, Pamela, Patrick, and others, each ""side"" of the Irish Troubles is represented and beautifully written. The writing is so well done that often you look up from the book to realize you aren't in the book's setting, and are disappointed that you aren't there. The characters are raw and real and the kind of people you'd have in your group of friends.Every aspect of this book is worth reading and I highly recommend it."
3,"they ""can't live without it""","first i must say i love the cover foto, and the cd title is cheeky.. This is their second offering(definately a more mature sound and more serious. with typical change in line-up.....the cd starts with ""got my eye on you"" catchy dance(reminds me of The Jets), ""i can't stop"" (think of early Cover Girls). ""cross my Heart"" very cheesy ballad reminds me of (High School Musical) lol. ""on the beach"" a nice ballad, i could hear this on broadway in a musical. ""ecstacy"" returns to the mix of pop/freestyle that suites them best. ""can't live without it"" is sultry and funky, very 80's, mind you this was released in 1991. ""domino"" traditional freestyle track.the final track ""i believe in you. a ballad that really show cases their vocals and harmony....Overall each track showcases their versitality if you pop with a dash of freestyle check it out."
5,Run for the Dream - The Gail Devers Story [VHS],"I would definately purchase from The Book Worm again. I ordered Run for the Dream - The Gail Devers Story [VHS] because it was not available on dvd and I am very glad I did. They got this movie, which was an excellent movie, to me in great condition (brand new.. still in package) and was shipped to me in a timely manner as promised. They also included a very nice hand written note thanking me for my business. Definately the type of people I want to do business with and would absolutely recommend them to others. Thanks for caring about your customers!!"
1,I never received my cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I contacted seller that I didn't receive my cd. He told me that package was lost by UPS. He promised me to send another cd the same day, which I also didn't get.I've send 2 mails to refund my money and didn't get any answer."
4,Edcational and Straightforward,"Educational and straightforward. Superb knowledge base for the would be sailor, adventurer or umbrella salesman."
3,"Great bag, but too small for us","Great backpack with pockets for things, but simply too small. We're probably going to keep it to use as a light hiking backpack."
3,Good old time SF,I thought it was interesting and enjoyed reading my personal copy several times over the past thirty years. It isn't modern day SF trash.
4,A Passion for Life,"This is a must see for anyone in the education field. Although it is 50 years old, it was way ahead of it's time. It is a story about a teacher who is hired to teach young boys in France right after the end of the war. His teaching styles are progressive and quite different than the ""arms folded-memorizing facts"" method. The boys learn by doing, creating their own printing press, building a water mill, and interviewing townspeople about their work. The best part is the way the teacher ""reaches out"" to a paticular boy who is troubled... Any teacher, or parent, can relate."
5,A Wonderful Film For All Educators,"This fantastic film is about a teacher attempting to introduce ""modern"" teaching methods to a rural multi-graded school near Provence after WWI. This film is remarkable for many reasons. It was made in the early 1950's in France, but it prophetically deals with many current issues of education: curricular reform, open classroom, expeditionary learning, political resistance to educational change, epistemology, subjectivity, the role of teacher as revolutionary, to name but a few. It's truly remarkable."
2,Live At Kabuki,I love QMS. I am lukewarm about Dino Valenti. But everything else about them is great. This recording is obviously taken from a radio broadcast. The music may have been good but the sound quality is very ordinary. Greatdul Dead have shown that old tapes can be cleaned up to provide listenable recordings. No one bothered with this one. Unfortunately.
4,"well, it is new year's eve...","I really like Quicksilver and I would buy this album again; however, they sound really drunk and probally on acid too, not that that necessarilly has to be a bad thing. The sound recording is terrible. I think part of the problem is analog at times just won't convert to digital well."
3,FIEL TESTIMONIO DEL MOMENTO EN QUE QUICKSILVER EQUIVOCA EL CAMINO.....,"YA NADA ERA IGUAL...YA NO HAY ESPACIO PARA EL AGUIJON DE CIPOLLINA NI LA CABALGATA DE GUITARRAS DESENFRENADAS...TODO SE VISLUMBRA POCO CLARO TRAS LA VOZ DE VALENTI...LA EDICION COMENTADA REPRESENTA LA OPORTUNIDAD DE ESCUCHAR COMO LA BANDA DESANDA UN CAMINO PARA PERDER EL RUMBO...POR MOMENTOS LAS GUITARRAS PARECEN ENCAUZARLO TODO PERO DE A POCO EL PROTAGONISMO EXCESIVO DE DINO VALENTI EMBARRA MUCHO....PREFIERO LA EDICION ANTERIOR, LA QUE NOS REGALABA A QUICSILVER EN SUS MEJORES MOMENTOS (LOST GOLD AND SILVER), AUNQUE, ES DIGNO DE DESTACAR, LA PUBLICACION DE ESTE TIPO DE MATERIAL ES IMPORTANTE PUES REFLEJA UN MOMENTO MUY PARTICULAR DE ESTA BANDA GENIAL..AUNQUE SEA EL PROLOGO DE SU CAIDA.....AH, EL SONIDO, ES BASTANTE DECENTE....QUE ESPERABAS DE UNA GRABACION DE CASI 40 AÑOS ATRAS!!!!"
4,Questions deserve answers,"As the director of this movie, that was poorly distributed it is very reassuring to read the reviews. For the viewer in Tennesse that asked about Peter...he plays the Reverend...the man who intially set up the marriage and who comes to the jail in hopes of saving the soul of Annie Herron. If you are curious about this story read the original short story called Wilderness Station by Alice Munro - one of our finest. AW"
4,A gem of a sleeper,"I had never heard of this film before in the US. Like another reviewer I only came upon this film after looking into the work of Caroline Dhavernas, a tremendously beautiful and talented actress largely (and sadly) unknown to US audiences. The cinematography of the Canadian wilderness and gritty realism of the settlements bring to life the hostility of the Canadian frontier. The violence is disturbing, but in context, and excellently portrayed. Brendan Frehr is both believable and despicable as the tormentor of Dhavernas' character, and Anne Wheeler did an outstanding job directing the talented young cast in such a challenging environment.Having become familiar with Dhavernas through Wonderfalls, this film brought to light the breadth of her acting range and I hope to see her in more projects in the US."
5,A dark treasure!,"I remember hearing the story of the spider and the fly when I was a kid, but I didn't exactly remember how it went. I think if I had had this book back then, I would have remembered it very well. The illustrations in this book are so beautiful and delicious! Even if the story totally sucked, this book would be worth the price for the pictures alone. But the story doesn't suck! The little details thrown in with the bug ghosts trying to warn the fly...it was just so unique. This book truly is a treasure to me, my collection will benefit greatly from it."
2,A little creepy for a young child,"My first memory of this poem was watching Jackie Gleason read it. I was sitting between my parents on the couch, with shivers down my spine, giggling in delight. I knew then what the story was all about, understood the moral. It continues to be a favorite poem of mine. So I was interested in this book. Oh my - ages 4-8, really? The spider is morphed into a creepy villian, and the fly is of course a sweet innocent young girl. I understand the authors intent, to teach children about falling into traps. But I think kids get that just fine without anthromophizing the characters. The illustrations are fantastic, and I can see children a little older loving the creepiness (maybe 8 and up). But I suspect that many younger kids would be frightened by seeing these creatures humanized like this. Thats not to say you shouldn't read it to your child. But you should know your child well enough to know whether to read it now or wait until they are more mature."
5,The Spider and the Fly,"When I was growing up, I only ever knew the first verse of this poem. I came across the complete poem in a library book when I was 12 years old. I was fascinated by it and learned the whole poem off by heart. I now belong to a Writers Club and wanted to resight the poem to them. I found I had forgotten two of the lines in the poem so decided to track it down. When the book arrived I was delighted by the illustrations and showed it to my 6 year old grandaughter who is learning to read. It has now become her favourite book. I love the moral of the book and know that it appeals to children of all ages. I believe it should be added to all the schools curriculum. The fact that this poem was written in the 18oo's also holds a fscination to think that it has survived the riggers of time. The moral of the book still holds tru today, perhaps even more so!"
5,great book,"Beautifully written and beautifully illustrated.Wonderful cautionary tale with a great sense of humor.Great to read to 4/5/6-year-olds. My son loved it, and with a little gentle assistance, got the message."
5,clever rhymes,"My daughter brought home this book from her school library. I was excited to read it to them because it was near Halloween, but what I didn't expect was to enjoy it as much as I did. The story is smooth and easy to follow even though it rhymes. I enjoy using my voices for the fly and spider. It makes the book almost sing-songish and my kids get a kick outa me. I have caught them reading it to each other trying to mimic my voices. :)Anyway, after the story is finished there is a little epilogue from the the author explaining in adult terms the importance to protect our children from unlikely sources...who prey upon the weak etc.I want to buy this book for my daughter's birthday. It has become an instant hit in our family. Get it, you won't be sorry."
4,okay,the tri pod thing broke already...i dont wanna go through the hassel of sending it back so i hope crazy glue works. the other stuff works perfectly
4,Good product,"It does its job. The materials look kind of cheap, but in the overall it is a good product."
4,Grandkids love it,My granddaughters think Sponge Bob is the best. This video has a few different cartoons on it. They watch it every day.
2,The Rotten Apple of the American Pie Franchise,"The Book of Love is the final entry in the American Pie Presents series and it is the worst. Eugene Levy's cameo can't help this outrageous and unfunny sequel. Well, actually it is a recycled version of all the American Pies with the reintroduction of the book of love. The cast has no chemistry and the script feels like it is a first draft. Yes, there's graphic nudity, graphic language, sexual situations, and gross out humor, but it is all done in bad taste. There are a few scenes that attempted to be funny, but failed to do so. I bought the movie for a $1.96 at a Black Friday sale, otherwise I would have never watched it."
2,"LAST SLICE OF PIE, PLEASE!","I have seen one other film in the AP series, and I am not very pleased with the movies. Now to set the record straight I love teenage sex comedies. However, a boy making love to a PB&J is not in my realm of humor. Toss in a dog and his brother filming the event and I am out the door. The movie missed a golden opportunity in The Book of Love. It attempted to reunite certain characters from the past to the present. We had Booger, from the classic ""Revenge of the Nerds"" as a teacher and Rosanna Arquette from ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" This should have been a parade of champions from past teenage sex comedies, instead we just get a few to tempt us. Nudity, sexual situations and non-stop crude sex language. Degrading to women, men, and dogs. Funny at times but not worth the coin."
2,Carbon copy of the first one,"I'm a huge fan of the American Pie series, and have always bought them as soon as they came out. I disagree with those that say it was going downhill; I loved 5 and 6. But this is a new exercise in pathetic. It is literally a carbon copy of the first one, right down to the characters:Rob=JimNathan=KevinLube=FinchStifler=StiflerThe script has a couple new gags in it, including the titular encounter with the legendary Bible from #1, which is the only interesting part. Other gags include an unfortunate encounter with an elderly Canadian hooker, and an even more unfortunate encounter with a moose. These gags are so far over the top they're not even funny. The premise of the movie as a whole is literally the EXACT same thing as #1.The series was awesome, but I guess it had to come to an end eventually. It truly pains me to say it, but if they come out with #8, I'll rent it before I buy it."
2,Not Typical American Pie,"I love the American Pie movies... I was excited about this being another great movie.... well, I was saddly disappointed with it... I gave it two stars out of pitty..."
1,Disappointing,"Despite the fact that we are now on the 7th American Pie film, there is still a certain standard that needs to be lived up to. While these films have not been very good since the first trilogy, they have still managed to be juvenile and raunchy fun. Book of Love managed to be juvenile and raunchy, but not fun or good. In the Delta House and Naked Mile, we were left with characters that were fun to watch and the stunts that occurred left for an entertaining movie. Instead, I cringed throughout the newest installment with how unfunny the jokes were and how often I had seen them before. While these films are supposed to be fun and crazy, I expect them to be entertaining also. This wound up easily being the worst one in this series, which was disappointing, as Delta House was the best movie since the first three.Stiffler and the British girl were awful characters also."
3,"American Pie,Book Of Love","This movie was not as funny as other American Pie Movies.The Quality of the picture was good on Blue Ray.But not enough to warrant me going out and buying a Blue Ray Player, which I did."
3,not bad had potential,"American Pie movies are all great comedies. Book of Love had great potential but, should of picked different actors for some of the parts. It is worth a buy to watch one time and start up American pie collection. The reason this movie is more bearable is a familiar face Eugene Levy I find him to be a good actor and played in every American Pie."
2,A/P - Book of Love,"I have all of the other American Pie movies so I thought I should purchase this one. Really wasn't all that impressed with it. If I had seen it before buying it, I probably won't have spent the money to buy."
1,Boring and crude,"This was a useless movie , distasteful I mean come , I don't mind some cheap and some crude humor and I love American Pie but this was not thought about in the making, the actors are poorly done , this is just a poor movie , not thought through and a complete waste of money"
1,"Need More Study,,,","I obtained this workbook, the first book I've read by this author, ""Tina Ketch."" Yes, the book explains which color candles to light for a calender date, hour, and minute. However, I have yet to see anything I desire be manifested by my lighting and burning these colored candles. There is really not enough information here, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be lighting 3 or 4 candles."
4,An amusing film...,"Trevor Finch's (Christian Slater) life is hanging by a thread as he is taken hostage by Jim (Tim Allen), a skilled hitman. Jim is a serious enthusiast of classic cinema as he uses lines from different films and complains about the missing magic in current films as he awaits the call for Tout's extermination. During the wait Finch begins a long story that has a jewel heist, prison escape, beautiful woman, and much more. The story hooks Jim as he learns about a mistaken identity that might prolong Finch's life. Who is Cletis Tout is a well-written story with much film history that amuses as it contains both suspense and adventure to keep most audiences entertained."
3,crime caper with laughs,"Fairly implausible, especially the idea to get the treasure back, 2/3 thru the film. Yet, fairly entertaining, as well, using the idea of Tim Allen, as the man who simply wants to be entertained in the finest of Hollywood tradtion--the classic film as Americana.So, most of the film references are blindingly obvious and are thrown out in an unnecessary, similar manner each time. However, the familiarity of the films that Allen refers to, are enough to make you smile---easy, relaxed entertainment, like play acting or mimicking our favorite lines, as we all have done, with our friends.Not a great movie, verging on the ridiculous, yet you get to see Allen in as odd a role ( for him ), as you'll ever see. Slightly above average, and worth a look."
4,An intermediate level resource,"This book is, in my opinion, most suitable towards intermediate (learn most of what's commonly available online, already has a few other references on his shelf and starting to develop a general position based on what has been learned) level military enthusiasts. It provides an overview of a wide variety of Russian weapons with some details.Definitely not suited for beginners (this is definitely not to be your first desk reference) due to the occasional errors pointed out by other reviewers. Don't worry, the errors are quite obvious and a more experienced reader will filter them out automatically, but a beginner will ingest some funny stuff indeed."
4,This book is a unique resource,I have never seen another book like this on this topic. The pictures are fantastic and there is lots of interesting history and comments on the weapons development and such. The color photos are amazing. I found it very interesting how the author broke up the development by design bureau. I paid alot more at the book store than what Amazon is asking for.
2,He is laughing at us...,"Not with us. I can't help but feel that Kundera was in need of some extra money, penned this book one drunken weekend, and offered it to Kundera fans with the excuse ""it's a divertimento."" That body part his character compares to the moon--well that's what he was thinking of us readers.Skip this one."
1,He's not worthy,"It seems that Milan Kundera himself should not be worthy of such bad fiction. This review is written by a girl who has read anything Kundera has ever written and who has loved every sentence, phrase, comma and semi-colon. SLOWNESS gives us a strange kind of vulgarity which never transposes into an elegant, laughable, unbearably light, immortal sensuality. Yes, this book was certainly a page-turner because I was trying to finish it as soon as I could. I have often accused Kundera of recycling the same ideas between his fiction and his essays (even here the lines are blurred), but at least these ideas were profoundly original and witty and full of fictional talent. SLOWNESS was short and slow. It missed the mark, at least for this reader. As we say in French, ""dommage."" (Too bad)."
1,Offensive Content,"This book is very offensive, the language is vulgar (to say the least) and then there is the sexual acts portrayed. My husband & I are offended that this book was even recommended (for a class assignment) to be read - it was such a waste of time & energy! Some feel that adults can handle this content, but being an adult hasn't change my morals."
3,Another Side of Kundera,"Not the usual style of Kundera's writing, a lighter path of writing, many mixed stories and characters that demonstrate the brilliance of Kundera.It shows the different levels of people in the society, what attracts them and what standards each one maintains and tries to inspire in others around him. How people get hooked on few things in their heads, and many of their actions just depend on who is around them to notice them, and what image they would be transmitting.Very interesting stories that keep you wondering, and the style of Kundera shocks you many times just by being very detailed oriented and open in his expressions and thoughts."
3,sample other kundera first,"Don't look at this book and think because of its brevity it will give you a quick feel for whether or not you like Kundera. Perhaps I should say, a feel for whether or not you like Kundera's 'better' books. ""Slowness"" is a rhapsody on a single theme. I enjoyed it-- hence the three stars-- but not nearly as much as ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being,"" or Kundera's essays. ""Slowness"" in fact reads like an essay. Less a novel than commentary on the lost art of taking things slow."
3,"&#65533;Some dance to remember, some dance to forget&#65533;","An intimate look at a cacophony of characters that converge in their desire to remember and forget. According to Kundera, ""slowness"" allow us to marinate in our memories."
3,Not up to usual Kundera standards,"Let me begin by saying that this is not a bad book. In fact, if it were written by an unknown, nameless author I might find it rather brilliant. However, when compared with other Kundera works, this one falls, saddly, short. It lacks the self propultion of his other books. In addition, the sweet meloncholy of his other characters is missing in this text. All in all, this book is worth reading. However, if this is your first encounter with Kundera,I would recommend reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being, or Ignorance first."
5,Kundera at his most poignant,This is by far and away my favorite book of all time. Kundera at his finest!!! Read.
4,Slowness,"Another wonderful book! Kundera explores the direct correlation between Slowness & Memory; or Speed & Forgetting.In the 21st Century in the advanced economic nations, personal democracy may or may not be a an all-time high. Feminism, high wages for high skills, increased multiculturalism, etc. The counter argument to this is the speed of modern society is infringing upon memory/happiness."
3,False economy?,"I bought this because it was the cheapest screenwriting software available... A major inconvenience with it is that you need the CD in place when you run it. Like many people, I use two PCs - a desktop and a laptop - so that makes the requirement to have the CD to hand even more inconvenient. Tip: if your PC has a removable CD drive and you start the program with it removed, the program does not ask for it and runs anyway! The program does not handle certain script features very well, e.g. transitions and complex character headings like FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)."
1,Don't Buy this!,"You need the disk in order to use this program, which means... it's completely useless! I wrote a bunch of scripts using this program, then I lost the disk, now I'm S*#$ out of luck. If you like to keep your work use something else. Who thought this was a good idea?"
3,Good for the price,"Not as full featured as Final Draft or Movie Magic, and the spell checker sucks. Still, it is good value for the price. If you are just experimenting with script writing, or writing one for a class, its the way to go. If you are planning on doing a lot of screen writing, I'd spend the extra money and get Final Draft."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to import a script from MS Word and have been very disappointed. It's not very intuitive, lacks a clear description of the elements and has limited help functions. I am used to using MS Word and found this very frustrating. I just wanted a simple program without all the bells and whistles of the more expensive products, but am disappointed in this. Perhaps it could be different if I was starting from scratch and hadn't imported my script."
2,Not Worth The Aggravation!,"Please, please, please, do yourself a big favor and save your pennies, stand on the street corner if you have to and take donations and buy Final Draft. Sometimes when you pay less you don't get a bargain, you get a lot of headaches which is exactly what this program is. THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS EXCELLENT. I feel sorry for them because it takes both: a good product and good tech support. This does not format stage plays professionally. If you're like me, you don't have the time for all of this aggravation. Spend your money on the professional quality programs, work like a professional and spend the extra time that you're not being aggravated perfecting your craft. I'm giving it 2 stars for the tech support."
4,My daughter loves it!,"My 5 year old loves this game, she plays it over and over without getting tired of it... the activities are easy to complete, and the whole game can be played in less than an hour. Plus she can print the final picture of Barbie getting married! Probably for girls over 6 it is too easy and boring!"
4,Pretty Good,"My daughter liked this C.D. Rom and she is 4. She needed some help, I wish they would put setting for different levels on the some of the activites. The mazes, cake baking,and music were to difficult and she needed some help, but overall she had fun. I don't think an older child would have problems. The music is pretty and the whole adventure is enchanting. My daughter loves dressing her for the wedding."
3,Fancy girls will love this,"My daughter received this for her fourth birthday. She is a girly girl and LOVED it immediately. Almost a year later, she still plays it. It has a lot of different kinds of activities. Some are educational (matching, following instructions) and some are just fun (choosing the style of the dresses, decorating a wedding cake). My only wish is that this game had levels of difficulty. My daughter played with this so frequently when she first got it that she mastered it quickly. And while she still has fun with it, the challenge of it is long gone."
5,Great but I like the Villian better than the Hero,"This is an awesome read especially for historical romance. The way Ms. Mills writes makes it seem like you are right there living the pages. Its such an engrossing and wonderful story. Actually most of the books in this series are really good. I wish more ""historical"" romance writers wrote this way. I like more complex story lines and detailed characters. This book had it all. The only thing is that I found myself liking the villian Robert Count Belsme more than I liked the Hero. The hero was just too ""virtous and good"" for my taste, I rather liked Robert for his hard edge, cunning, and strenght. If there was one thing I would change in the series is that Robert of Belsme would have found his own love or rather his redemtion through another heroine and had his own book for the series. Anyhow read this book and its counterparts you won't regret it."
5,Great Reference from a NJ State Ornithologist,"This book tells what birds are likely to be found in any of NJ's various natural habitats, whether ocean beach, dunes or thickets, salt- or fresh-water marshes, cedar swamps or ponds, pine deciduous or hardwood forests, mountain ridges, field, bogs, or city parks. It descripbes the birds' mating, nesting, feeding and other habits."
4,Good singer (and not a bad-looking guy either),"Pleasant, energetic pop from this former boyfriend of Debbie Gibson can definitely hold company with the more well-known boy bands and male popsters of the time; particularly on the standout track ""One Time."" If you find this definitely get it."
3,overpriced,"item flies on occasion, but crossbar comes off in less than 20 mph breeze,overpriced and it stains. Would not buy again."
1,Expensive junk,"In spite of moistening and flattening this kite and putting more fastening holes as per the directions, this kite just doesn't want to fly.Very clever to have kites that look like birds, but it takes more than some advertising copy to make this one fly.Disappointing to spend this much on a gift and then have it be the only kite on the field that won't fly.If you want to hang it from the ceiling to look at, you will probably like it. If you want a kite to fly, save your money."
4,"Penn excells with ""MHJ"".","Michael Penn is a ridiculously underrated talent. ""Mr Hollywood Jr."" is not his best record; that would be ""Resigned"". But it's awfully good. Penn does not hide his affection for The Beatles; it permeates everything he does. But Penn has some real rock muscle, combined with pop sensibilities. That's a rare combination and Penn has mastered it, here."
2,Too short to do much good,"Good idea in theory, but it is too short to span any area much to work. They might think about selling it longer (charging more of course). You could always tie a knot in it to then adjust it. Maybe two together would work? Velcro at ends good idea. Did not work well for us."
5,Great!,"This worked very well! Because it has velcro loops, it could hook on to nearly anything and the clothes did not slip off at all without using clothespins! Very useful for a long European trip!"
3,Surprise,"Item received not as shown or as advertised. Item received stretches to 6 feet per package, not 7 feet as in description. Ends are Velcro strips."
5,Perfect for a cruise ship cabin,"The velcro strips allowed me to hang this in my cruise cabin, attaching it to the frame of the shower door and a towel bar. Also, used it outside on my balcony, hanging it between 2 chairs. Well made. Glad I bought it. I used it along with inflatable hangers that I also bought for this trip."
4,Good for travel,"Works well for hanging. The velcro is strong and seems to hold well at difference tensions and different stretch distances. It's a little bit of a chore to pull the chord apart to hold the clothes, but they stay in tight and don't fall. Well made and should last a while."
5,Great Clothlines; Description and Picture Need Updating,"This clothesline is as good as everyone says: strong, light (only 1.7oz/48g), versatile, and convenient. However, once I receive mine, I realized that both the picture and description are outdated. The picture shows a loop affixed to each end of the clothesline. This is correct, although recent versions also ship with additional velcro loop straps on each end, which makes it easier to attach the line to furniture, door handles, curtain rods, etc. The description also is inaccurate, as it claims the clothesline stretches up to 7 feet, whereby the product packaging states that it stretches up to 6 feet."
3,Good but not perfect,"I agree with the other comments. This product would be better if it had suction cups or clips in addition to the loops. In a hotel room, the obvious place to hang this type of line is from doorknob to doorknob, but that means it's hanging across the room (usually from the bathroom door to the entry door), making it difficult to move around in the room. Also, sometimes I would have preferred to hang the line higher, but I was limited by the height of the doorknob."
2,ERROR,I wanted a line that would suction to the walls. I'm not sure if the error is mine or yours. What can I do about it.
2,Failed in winter,"I left this outside in winter for a few days and the rubber thoroughly cracked and disintegrated leaving it unusable. For warm weather only. I expect better durability from a simple clothesline.Edit: To the response saying this is for hotel rooms indoors, I think it's quite common to hang clothes on a balcony."
1,was mine defective?,This clothesline was terribly disappointing. No matter how hard we tried we could not stretch it past 3 feet.It was pretty much a waste of time and money. Perhaps mine was defective?
3,Too short close line,"I got this as I had never traveled where I would consider washing my clothes. This clothes line was in many instances too short in most cases. I would recommend getting one that is about 2-3 feet longer or bring along some nylon shoelace to tie to it to lengthen it. That is my own personal experience. The braided line did allow for using it without clothes pins and it was small and compact. When it was stretched out, I had the velcro not hold twice and come back at the end of the day and my clothes on the floor."
1,Not good,"Too short, no hooks and/or suction cups at the ends. The loops were not helpful in setting up. Most importantly, it was just too short. We brought one other line which we ended up using becuase it was better constructed (longer, suction cups AND clips). I would not recommend this item."
4,Biggest challenge will be your imagination...,"Giving this 4 stars instead of 5 just because I think it is overpriced. We used this for a 2 week trip to Italy, and it worked well, no clothes pins needed. The biggest challenge for me was figuring out where to hang it. I would complain to my husband there wasn't any place, and he would string it between a desk drawer handle and a sturdy TV wall bracket - or between a patio terrace and an iron outdoor chair - places that never occurred to me. We did not try blue jeans on it, nothing bigger than a shirt. Might need one for ea. person on next trip..."
4,handy,"I used this on my trip. I packed light and was able to hand wash and re-use pants, tops, socks, and undergarments. The rubber got a little stretched out by the end of the 9-day trip, but was still useable. I'm grateful for the velcro fasteners at each end."
4,Great for travel,"A very strong and durable clothesline. I searched around for a good quality one for an extended month long trip to europe where I was bringing just a carryon bag. This worked great! It's a little hard to get clothes in there at first, but that's what I wanted to keep those heavy wet clothes hanging. I wouldn't travel without this."
3,Oedipus Rex,"Not for me. Has English subtitles. I wanted to use this in my English 12 class. I have sent an email to Moviemars, but to date have received no reply. I want to return the item unopened."
3,Greek tragedy or Italian saga?,"Pasolini's Oedipus Rex is not a movie to be taken lightly. It is definitely intended more as a discussion centerpiece than an actual beacon of entertainment. The story is told in a symbolistic manner, however, leaves a little too much lee-way in the sense of captivating general audiences. It's a hard movie to get engaged with, however majestically intended it may be."
3,June Christy,"Not her best album, but still good. I need to add 13 more words for some reason, so here they are."
5,Great for my tot,"My 2 year old already learned his letters, numbers, and colors so I wanted to find him a game for that. One thing he has trouble with still is controlling a mouse so this gamed was all keyboard work. He loves it. He can learn ocean facts as a bonus too."
2,Better Choices Out There,"My son loves his ClickStart, which we started with The Thomas the Tank Engine and Dora programs. We added Diego and Nemo after we saw that he liked it. Of all the titles I would say this one is the most lame.To start, the characters don't look all that much like they do in the movie and of course the voices are not the same - this was a little distracting. But the big issue is that the games themselves are not very good. The objectives are unclear and the feedback lacking. In contrast the Dora and especially Deigo games are engaging, challenging and well-paced.The more your little one likes Nemo the less they'll like this game."
3,Good for 2-4 yr olds,"This software is billed as building kindergarten and 1st grade skills - it actually builds preschool skills like matching, very basic letter recognition, counting, color recognition beyond primary colors, rhyming and matching items."
2,Not enough,"For the price of it, this doesn't give a child enough to do...My 3 year old granddaughter got bored with it pretty quickly...they should put more on it for the price of it!"
5,Christmas Pins Past & Present Second Edition,This somewhat small book was extremely helpful to me in identifying the values of some recently purchased Weiss candle Christmas Tree Pins. It has also shown me what pins do not carry such a high value.I would love to see more books like this one for holiday jewelry.I would highly reccommend this book to anyone interested in Vintage and New Christmas Jewelry.
3,"""Big Bad Fred""","""Mean Johnny Barrows"" is about dishonorable discharge veteran who can't find a job because of past allegation. The only job offered goes against his moral code,but soon he is in the game as a dangerous hitman.This movie has a lot of twist and turn, but Big Bad Fred is alway one step of his enemies.Like the movie poster, Fred comes with two double barrel shotgun to give his enemies a one-way ticket to hell.The 1970's playbook on military tactic in cinema is on display,with Fred using his skill to outwit a scheming mobster and his deadly girlfriend."
5,Awsome Book,"This book is incredible, although you should probably use this book in conjunction with your studies, if you are a genius you could pass with just this book. It has enough information to cover the entire exam."
3,"Not good reading, poorly asked questions","I bought this book to study for the Network+ exam, however I found the book hard to follow. When taking the practice tests at the end of each chapter, I felt I did not absorb enough to pass the tests. After reading this book, I went out and got Exam Cram 2 Netowrk+ and found it to be a much better book."
5,JUST PASSED,"I bought this book and used it to study for the exam. I have been working in the field for five years and used nothing else. I passed, and think if you have knoledge about networking this is the only book you need"
1,falcon air horn,i bought 2 falcon air horns for christmas.they were for my grandsons for use at the ny ranger games.one worked the other had no air .i would not buy this product again because its real use is for saftey on the water and the odds of it working is only 50/50
1,hurts the air not helps,"There are some really excellent negative reviews here. I'm only writing a review to add confirmation to those negative reviews. True they give warnings that it 'may smell for a couple hours' and *may* bother those who are sensitive to smells. But I'm not very sensitive to air contamination, it took me a full 2 days to develop scratchy throat and eyes - but only when I was in the room with this thing. My husband asked me after the first night, ""are you trying to kill me?"" I laughed ha ha -it's helping not hurting! I said. What did I know? I just wasn't affected *yet*.I never send things back. But I sent this back. Good riddance."
1,Cingular Stinks,"Cingular has coverage, better than most, but be prepared to pay for it. Also, if you want a phone that does more than just make calls, like access the internet, beware: cigular just wants to provide voice service, and they don't maintain web services unless you are willing to shell out another five or ten bucks a month for some third party service that will probably not work on your phone. I had T-mobile but got tired of thier lousy coverage, so I got AT&T, who was a great provider. Now cigular owns me and they don't honor thier rollover plan, and my free services disappear monthly. Also, cigular loves to rob you if you need a new phone, no discounts or promotions, just full retail. I have a phone that can access the internet and folds open for easy email and text messaging, they offer no replacement for such a device, outside of a four hundred dollar Blackberry. I hate this company. They stiff you at every opportunity."
1,Force 2 yr contract ?!,"What is going on? Amazon used to offer option for 1 or 2 yr contract for all voice plan. Now, it only has 2 yr contract?! BE AWARE buyer. It only shows up 2 yr contract in regular size font, and you probably wouldn't notice if you didn't read carefully. AND it only has 15 days cancellation policy now. It used to have 30 days.IT IS NOT WISE to stuck for 2 yrs.I guess it is what you can after they purchase ATT wireless. Less competition is bad for consumers.They now have less minutes and poorer services.."
1,1 year contract??,I was looking for a new phone today and was surprised to see there are no plans with 1 yr. contract from cingular!! This is ridiculas.
1,Had better service before Cingular became AT&T again,"I was weary of AT&T turning into Cingular a while back, but was quite happy with Cingular. Now that they turned into AT&T again I have nothing but problems. My calls often get dropped or will not go through at all! It sometimes takes numerous attempts (6 or 7) to get through, if I don't give up first. I do not have an old phone, I recently bought a Blackberry Curve, which I felt improved my service quality from my old RAZRv3, but that perk quickly declined to worse service than ever before. I do not recommend this service. I'm thinking Verizon might be a good choice."
4,The last good record of Kon Kan,"Kon Kan, a great group. This is the record that includes the hit single ""Liberty"". If you remember Kon Kan from the preceding hit song ""Harry Houdini"", well you'll love it. It's a ""must have"". But you'll ask ""Why?"" Well, it's a hard-to-find-song ""Liberty"" in any compilation that you would find on a record store. From the beginning of the song, you would like to move your feet anywhere... So, what are you waiting for? Enjoy remembering your teen age."
5,Collapsible LED Safety Cone,"Whenever I'm in Los Angeles, I use the Collapsible LED Safety Cone when I walk, since the motorists don't care about pedestrians. I wear it like a hat, after having modified it to weigh less, inserted a chin strap, soft interior, etc. It fits great and I'm very visible. It is collapsible if I want to go into a formal restaurant. I may look like a dunce but it beats getting smashed by some motorists and I am protected in court in case their excuse is, ""I didn't see him."" It even has a LED light atop it."
5,better than flares,"I keep one of these on top of the spare (it's that thin) in every vehicle I own. Reflective tape and flashing LED are sure to get attention. Flares are one time use and burn out over time. Plus, do you really want to keep a potential ignition source (flares) above your fuel tank?"
2,"Good cone, but overpriced","This cone is a good-quality, easily-stowable piece of safety equipment. The flashing light is not on top as shown in the photo, but is inside the base, illuminating the entire cone from the inside. I find the flashing light to be an unnecessary feature, but perhaps it is a draw for some people. The cone itself is a good size and seems sturdy with decent reflective tape. I purchased 3 of these in order to examine them more closely. I then decided to buy some additional cones, but discovered that the price had doubled from $10.19 to over $20.00 per cone. I would recommend that this cone is a bargain at $10.19, but not worth double the money, hence my recommendation dropped from 5 to 2 stars."
5,Casio Men's DW290-1V,"Great sports watch, does everything you need without all the other complications. Big thing you just don't seem to get is how you can stay up on current time while using timers. Highly recommend this watch."
1,"reflection on the vendor, not the product","The watch is actually pretty nice for the price. However it is not a real g shock as shown in the picture And stated in title. Box is regular Casio and bevel on the face is not raised like g shocks. Nice touch though, countdown timer doesn't automatically start again aftear reaching zero. Not a bad watch. Just not what was stated."
3,Casio Men's DW290-1V Classic Alarm Chronograph Shock Resistant Sport Watch,"I bought this for my son and he liked the watch, but, since he just received it, I couldn't possibly write a very informative review at this point.I, can, however, tell you that I am very upset that, though the pictures featured for this product show that it is a G-Shock watch, (G-Shock box photo), it IS NOT A G-SHOCK watch.Amazon...you need to take a closer look at the pictures for this product and edit accordingly!"
4,Great bang for buck,"I know it's been said many times before, but the DW-290 really is one of the best bang for the buck watches. I've had mine for about a year now and, while my newer dw5600 is getting much more wrist time, I tend to wear this one around the house when doing chores and playing with my kids.It has lots of great features that are mentioned in all of the reviews (countdown timer, alarm, etc). The buttons are much easier to press (less recessed) than the 5600. The backlight is excellent. The band is so comfortable. It has a strong wrist presence.The reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars are for a couple of cons:The teal lettering on the band and bezel came off after just one day in a pool. This may not me a con for some, as it kind of looks good ""stealthed out"", but part of the charm of this watch is the colors.The band (on mine, at least) tends to squeak quite often as it rubs against the bezel.Other than those issues, the watch has held up well."
4,"strong watch, the characters on it faded quite easily in seawater.","I got this watch for use in snorkeling in beach. it is strong, and water resist. but the characters printed on it faded after maybe 4 hours in sea-water. that is quite funny and not expected."
5,Problem free since 1994,"I bought this watch in October 1994 and have worn it daily without problems. The battery was replaced in 2004, the original band was replaced before the battery. I can't say anything negative about this watch... it's simple to operate, durable, and performs like it did the day I bought it from Mervyn's 16 years ago. I highly recommend this watch!"
4,The Perfect size for hot dips!,This is my second Proctor Silex crock pot of the exact same model. After my nephews broke the first one on Thanksgiving day. I needed another one to replace it for the following weeks Christmas party. This pot is wonderful with its three settings. The warm function is perfect for not scalding or overcooking cheese dips. I couldn't ask for a better crockpot for cooking dips for large crowds or just for two.
3,Good Cooker but Needs Indicator Lights,"Minor complaints: First the lid allows moisture from to pool around the top of the crock pot, moisture does not drain back in the pot. Second, the pot does not have light to indicate if the pot is cooking or turned off. I like some kind of light indicator above the heat setting, so I know if the pot is turned on or turned on. This helps if you have several appliances with similar cords. I incorrectly thought I had the pot on, when I had plugged in the blender. Third, I would like a cord that is retractable, or easier to store into the base of the pot. The pot cooks as directed and it is easy to clean and store, takes up about the same space as two slice toaster or coffee pot. I highly recommend to anyone who needs to heat or cook small meals or recipes. I use the pot everyday to either heat leftover casseroles or to slow cook beans, soups and sauces."
3,About average,"It's what I expected. It is small enough to hold a meal for two people, with a minimum of leftovers. It cooks a little slower than the larger crockpots, but I find that to be an advantage."
2,Didn't work,"Made the food and put it into the brand new slow cooker, but it wouldn't turn on. Returned it. Did not purchase another one. It is extremely small though."
5,1.5 Quart Slow Cooker,"Great product, good price. Hard to find locally or in stores. This is the way to do it."
3,In the Pot,"The Proctor Silex 1 and 1/2 quart round slow cooker cooks well but for me, I find it is too small to make a dinner. It is better for rice dishes. Even cooking a meal for one person with this cooker would not leave left-overs and as it is round two chops or two chicken breasts could not be placed side by side to cook."
4,Great for the money with one drawback,"We already had a 6 quart slow cooker but the kids have moved away and that's too much for cooking for two. So we bought this, and it's done a great job for us. The one complaint I have is the insulation. There is none. The first time I cooked with it I went to open it (which involves unhooking a rubber band that holds down the top) and burned myself on the side of the crock. Badly. Since then I've burned myself one other time, though that one was a fluke (looking away while reaching for something else). Had I known about this I probably would have kept looking for one that has some kind of insulation, but it does such a good job I'm just going to try to always remember it wants to burn my fingers."
3,"Cooks perfectly, but is very small","Be warned that this product is quite small, like the size of a small rice cooker.I live alone, and since I love to cook, this slow cooker is great for making meals when I'm at work. I have no qualms about the products functions itself, just that 1.5 quarts was a lot smaller than I expected.The typical carton of chicken stock is about one quart, so after adding that, there's hardly any room for meat and vegetables, etc. if you're looking to make a soup. Additionally, this cooker will NOT fit a whole chicken or a medium-sized roast, so be careful when reducing recipes. Lastly, the size makes it a bit difficult to mix raw ingredients like vegetables because there isn't a lot of area inside the pot."
2,"Emphasis on ""Slow""","Temperature settings on this cooker don't seem to work. Or maybe something is wrong with mine. High never brings liquid to a boil. I put a stew on high, but 5 hours later, the potatoes and veggies are still rock hard. The broth isn't getting hot enough to cook anything.In my large, old 1960s slow cooker, high means boiling in a few minutes. I guess I'm going to have to transfer this stew into the old cooker if I want any dinner tonight.I like the small size and easy clean up of the 1.5 qt Proctor Silex, but maybe it's only good for overnight oatmeal and keeping sauces warm."
2,TINY!!,"This thing is seriously SMALL. I guess I just didn't realize that 1 1/2 quarts was such a small amount, but WOW it's really tiny. This is probably only good for someone who only cooks for themselves. Maybe I'll use this someday for some fondue or something...."
5,mini but perfect,"I used this mini slow cooker almost everyday. It is a perfect size for two people. I usually put everything in the morning with low power, and when I get home around 6pm, it is done. It saves me a lot of time. Plus, the inner pot is made of ceramic, which gives another star.Highly recommended!"
4,Just the Right Size...,"Easy to use and clean. Plus, it doesn't take up too much space. This is more for someone cooking a meal for one person."
5,Perfect size for dips and appetizers,I bought one of these in a hardware store several years ago. I liked it so much that I bought a second one for me and also one to give as a gift.
2,Terrible,"The low setting may as well not even exist. The thing doesn't get hot enough. On high, it cooks, but not enough - even after 8 hours. I don't use this anymore."
1,Avoid!,"The first slow cooker I received was obviously damaged. It was returned.The second slow cooker I received didn't have a working indicator light. By the way it was packaged, it had been previously returned.Doesn't Proctor Silex have any quality control checks?Why is Amazon reselling defective items?"
3,Great Size for One,"For one person this is a good size. It has excellent appearance and performs well.Two complaints: The cover will not allow condensed liquid to drain back into the crock; it can run over the edge and down into the base (a mess!, needless to say). The cord is CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Stiff as a dog's hind leg with rigor mortis. Most aggravating.Note: I use a bent wire to hold one side of the cover up about 1/16"" and this solves the drain-back problem. The crock rim should be designed to do this."
5,Perfect mini crock pot,Perfect size crock pot for when you don't need to feed an army. Not many bells and whistles but great for the price.Highly recommended.
4,great,"I love this, I was bought it as an anniversry present and it has been used loads. Very well made and can do so much. I would recommend getting this."
4,Good for congee but not for soup,"Very good for congee, you can leave it cooking all night and congee is ready the next morning. And it's very well cooked.But the power may be too low for soup. I cooked lotus and pork ribs soup with it, but the soup is too thin. And I never see it boiling even with high power. Maybe that's the reason."
4,"Plain and simple, small, has some special uses","Beware, this is a 1.5 quart unit, that is, six cups of food, and that's not going to take care of a roast or a big pot of stew. However, it will hold a meal for one or two people (and since I'm single, a big crock pot is not handy for me) and it will handle entertaining tasks such as holding queso hot dip or other small, hot appetizers.It will also do for tiny spaces (RV, studio apartment) but mainly I find this is really great when having a party. Everyone likes warm cheese dips.Here's a recipe:Melt some Velveeta cheese. Add in some chopped, drained, fire roasted tomatoes and as much of a can of roasted green New Mexican style chili as you can stand. If Velveeta goes against your notions of food, you can substitute a mix of grated Monterey Jack and some sour cream. Mix well, keep warm. I like this with blue corn chips."
2,A lot smaller than you would think,"I got this and whatever size you think it is, it seems smaller once you actually get it. If you want a slow-cooker, just go with the original crock-pot brand and size - we got one of those at Costco and it works great."
1,Proctor Silex 1.5 quart slow cooker,"First, it came with a big dent in the side. Second, the outside got VERY hot. Needless to say I returned it."
5,Works Great!,"Works great! I use it for steel cut oats: 1/4 c. steel cut oats to 1 c. water for a single serving. Add to pot, turn on low at night before bed, and it will be ready in the morning! Size up proportionately for more servings. If you want to add dried fruit into it, add more water -- the proportions then would be 1c. oats to 5 cups of water. The edges of the crock are a bit dried on with oatmeal, but I soak it for 20 mins. while I am getting ready for work, and it scrubs off easily."
4,Proctor Silex small slow cooker,This is the perfect size crock pot for small amounts. Easy to cook a few pieces of chicken without having to make a whole stew. Not too small not too larger. It is great that it has two heat settings plus the keep warm feature. Easy to clean. We also like the fact that it has a glass lid not a plastic one.
5,I LOVE IT!!!,"We got a giant 6 quart crock pot for our wedding and it's fantastic - but with just my husband and I, it's often too big. Cooking a stew for 2 would become a disaster because the 6 quart crock pot wouldn't allow all the ingredients to sit in liquid.This is perfect for 2. I can make all my crock pot recipes and scale them down so we don't waste any food and still have the convenience of coming home to a fully cooked meal. The price is so great - I definitely recommend this to singles or couples who love the tender slow cooked meals, but don't want to waste food or have to freeze left overs."
4,WORKS GREAT BUT,I love the product but the power cord is VERY VERY stiff. IT make the use of the product less convenient. One must work to plug it in. The manufacturer need to consider a power cord that is both safe and less stiff.
3,NO PILOT LIGHT,"You know, I have owned one of these for years and the ONLY thing that riles me about it is that it has NO PILOT LIGHT, to show you that it is on, or to remind you that you left it on, when you should have turned it off. Other than that,it does its job quite well. Great for singles."
4,Perfect for small cooking :),"So far I have made a few things in this little pot and love it. The only thing I don't like is, it doesn't have a shut off like the bigger pots have so I don't feel comfortable walking out of the house with it on."
4,Proctor Silex 33015 1-1/2-Quart Round Slow Cooker,"This is an awesome Crockpot the size perfect for pulled pork, sauces, Swedish meatballs, backed beans etc. The lid is made of glass instead not plastic which is great, the container pulls from the cooking unit goes into the refig and comes out and back into the unit to heat yet again limiting the need for storage containers, I liked it so much I bought the 4 QT version for stews and soups it is a great product for the price, can't go wrong here."
5,Very good product!,"I ordered this slow cooker after carefully reading all the reviews. This was a presant for my son who has done (so far) two dishes with very good results. He is a young adult and he doesn't have a very good cooking experience. However, he managed to have very tatsy stews for a very fast time (3 - 4 hours on HIGH). He cooks with this slow cooker just during the weekends. I hope that this product will last longer and help my child have tasty, healthy and easy meals.I also have a slow cooker and I think that it is a very useful for every household. Highly recommended!"
4,Mini cooker,Just the right size for 1-2 person cooking. Shipped quickly. Great for small batches of soup. Easy to clean with attractive design.
5,May peace prevail on earth !,"AMI who came from universe thougt us how man should reveal his innner self . If man live like he thougt , peace will absorutely prevail on earth . I hope as many persons as possible will read this book . I read in Japanese . Now I'm looking for English version . Thank you for reading my poor English review ."
3,for what its worth,"ok, so my entire family is addicted to the spicy italian spaghetti seasoning that Tone's used to put out. I got this when I could no longer get it. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't have the same impact. While it isn't bad, it isn't that great. Blah, normal, bland. A great background note when doctored, but not a stand alone."
2,Great playing and recording; bland interpretation,"I would recommend this CD to a student studying the score and wishing to hear as many of the instrumental lines as possible, but not to anyone else. The Chamber Orchestra of Europe is an absolutely first-class ensemble, and its playing is caught superbly by Finlandia's engineers. I just wish that Berglund's conducting lived up to the standard set by the playing and recording. Unfortunately, as thoughout this cycle, he seems to be going dourly through the motions, offering not even a glimpse of Sibelius's genius. I would suggest Bernstein/NYPO/Sony in the Sixth Symphony, and Maazel/VPO/Decca Legends in the Fourth, for thrilling stereo interpretations of these symphonies. If you want to hear a Finnish conductor, try Osmo Vänskä on BIS."
3,Nifty 90's Aussie Rock,"The 1990 Atlantic Records release from Aussie rock group 1927, tracks are as follows:1. tell me a story (4:10)2. don't forget about me... (for Elvis) (4:37)3. doin' it wrong (4:04)4. the other side (5:28)5. africa (4:12)6. a world without you (3:17)7. a day like today (3:30)8. call on me (3:56)9. why? (4:14)10. it's gonna get better (3:41)... tracks are all lower case as listed on back of CD.It might sound a tad ballad-y and dated, but it has charm, and certainly deserved more credit than it got. The sound is somewhere between The Outfield and Icehouse... very 90's. I would rate it higher, but it has limited replay value. I put the CD in to revisit certain songs, and honestly rarely listen to the whole album."
5,great!,thanks for really really fast delivery! took 4 weeks less than expected! waas a nice surprise! product just as described.
3,Dissatisfaction over original add,Originally the add for this product was for a case of this product.I recieved only 1 booster pack.The add was atleast changed to reflect it is only 1 booster instead of a case after the fact.
3,Excellent but....,"I used to own the ""Anka"" LP (1974) and it is one of my favorite 70's album. The only reason I give this CD 3 stars instead of 5 is that the song ""Let Me Get To Know You"" is different from the 1974 LP, which is my second favorite song on the LP right after ""Papa"". Hopefully one day it will be released on CD format."
1,Very disappointed,"Purchased this for my small lawn business. I've had nothing but problems after owning for 1 year. The gas cap leaks, the end of the blower tube constantly falls off, it takes forever to get started, runs very weak for its supposed hp rating.... I could go on... Stay away from this blower!"
4,Solo 440 blower/vacuum,"I bought the solo 440 to use solely with the inexpensive leaf vacuum kit. I was looking for a quality product. I used to have a $99 leaf vacuum/shredder from another make, it didn't have the power to pick up the leaves and the engine exhaust would hit my face. With the 29cc engine the Solo 440 seems to have good power. The handles and bag are comfortable. Today, I tested the Solo to pick up small palm,bamboo and avocado leaves, some over rocky surfaces and in plant beds. The Solo does the job pretty good without picking any rocks or harming the plants. The Solo has strong suction. One time the Solo impeller did jam with a piece of 2 inch wood mulch chip which was easily remedied by removing the suction tube. The Solo was a good buy."
3,Just the basics,"This is a good read if you are looking for the basics in dental office management, well written, but not a lot of detail in some areas.Particularly in the area of using computers in the dental practice, software choices, oral digital cameras, it skims the surface of what is actually available, and will have you at the mercy of your supplier if you are looking for answers.A great book if you plan to follow up with a more in-depth textbook, or work experience, but if you are looking for a tell-all volume, this falls a bit short."
1,Dumb purchase,I wish I never bought this book. It is so boring and not helpful. It might be useful to someone who is in junior high exploring careers
5,"Gorgeous Illustrations, Thought-provoking Text","This book, with its luminous gouche paintings and intimate, pillow-book size, is simply a pleasure, giving a deeper understanding of the meaning of this most elusive of books from the Bible. By approaching the Song of Songs from the perspective of longing, as illustrated by a woman longing for her beloved, Ernst has shed light on the the nature of divine longing, much in the tradition of the poetry of Rumi and other Sufi poets. In her eloquent commentary (which nicely intersperses the biblical text, so that one is not flipping back and forth constantly), Ernst places the Song of Songs into a broad cultural context, which allows for a meditation on the universality of the ideas expressed in the Song. An elegant gem of a book that can be savored for a long time."
5,Hell Yeah!!,"with songs like Bloody Mary Morning, Pretend I Never Happened, and It's not Supposed to be that Way...this album ranks right up there with my favorites from Willie...it's from 1974, classic era! and the same year that he played Austin City Limits...which is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Willie!"
4,Fast Delivery - Easy Assembly!,Great looking lamp for the money. Easy to assembly - no tools necessary - good instructions but you won't need them. The lamp shap is two arced pieces so you do have 2 obvious seams - but very sturdy. Could use a light diffuser to shield those sitting next to it on a lower couch from direct view of the bulb. The lamp is tall and very substantial. Solid heavyBase.A Good Buy Fast Delivery - Very Satisfied.
3,Lamp Shade is Cheesy,"I love the lamp part of this floor lamp,but the shade is just ridiculous. It's huge, bright white plastic. It cheapens what is a very elegant fixture. I ended up buying a new shade -- and finding a shade large enough for this size floor lamp is not easy or cheap (in other words, no luck at target, walmart or ikea). In my opinion, the shade shown on the picture is not the shade that is shipped with the lamp. the picture shows it to be slightly off white or ivory. It is not. It is stark white. It also seems much larger diameter-wise than the one shown."
3,"The Bad, the Nihilistic, the Sadistic","This is the film where art and torture become one. Moral values are tempered to relativism by a descent into absolute power and depravity. Salo takes the nihilistic worldview of Materialism to its logical extreme. The bleakest idea I have considered is that this is where we are heading today.Watch at your own risk. Nothing should be censored (almost), but some things leave you wondering if you really wanted to see that?"
2,"Good thing it was tame but,,,",sadism and perversion doesn't mean anything if the victims just don't react.For example If ANYone were to eat excement they WILL gag.But they Don't....This film couldn't really hold my attention at all.I couldn't believe in the film and i'm suprised at many of these reviews reading so many metaphors into it.Without reading up on the film (that is not being told what to read into it)I figured it was an indictment of facism and the cold callous cruely of the holocaust came to mind.But poignant metaphors throughout?-give me a break.And how can it be perverse or sadistic if the kids keep failing to mind?
2,it was bad the first time...,"Salo was a bad movie the first time I saw it in college a few years ago....and it was still bad after a recent viewing...in some repects even worse the second time around as it is incredibly dull, too long, with implausably passive teenagers putting up neary a struggle, etc.....a waste (literally) of time."
2,the Criterion version,I would like to inquire whether the Criterion Collection version has any extra scenes than the pervious version? in other words What are the difference between those two versions?
5,A stroke of the genius,"Truly a great film: I would place it in my Top 10, and I've seen a lot... To me as a Christian, this is about God and the man's longing for Him. What? Where do you see God in Salo? - you might ask. Well, it's really possible to make film about God, showing the opposite - the Hell. It depends on the author's approach. The Pasolini's attitude is sincere and poignant - what it lacks absolutely is cynicism."
1,Salo or the 120 Days of pointless perversion!,"What a nasty film! Gratuitous, pointless, self indulgent crap (no pun intended) posing as art. This is going direct to eBay..."
5,I Loved This Movie!,"This has got to be one of the best movies ever made! A perfect blend of action, comedy, and romance, ""Salo"" goes where most movies fear to tread, except for maybe ""Die Hard"" and ""Bad Boys II"". There are laughs every minute coupled with just enough gun fights to make even Clint Eastwood grin and sweat. And as far as the lovie dovey stuff, there isn't so much that it ruins the film, but I would have preferred more gratuitous nudity, like in ""Apollo 13"" when you see Kevin Bacon get out of the shower. Yeah, that's the one! I don't know why the rest of these reviews are all stuck on the artsy farsty elements of the film, I didn't get that out of ""Salo"" at all.The perfect date movie, ""Salo"" will guarantee a little somethin' somethin' after it's viewing.Two thumbs up. Way up!"
1,The kind of thing that needs to be buried.,"No need to see this, folks. If you are of sane mind, there is absolutely no need to pollute it with this filth. You know all you need to do is read a little snippet about this in literature and history books. There is no need to see anything like this at all, ever. You have got to be sick in the head to ""appreciate"" this sort of thing, and unintelligent to be able to even justify anything like this at all. Yes we all know Pasolini went berserk, and let it rest there. Don't touch this, folks. Decent people need to force our culture and community to bury this kind of absolute degradation and keep it buried."
5,The madness that lurks in great art,"I must admit that I approached this movie with trepidation, having heard and read so much about it. After having watched it, I must tip my hat to the late Pasolini, for I think it takes great talent to make a movie about human perversions without resorting to cheap shock. The cinematography is mesmerising. The sets are minimal. The dialogue is charmingly warped. The acting is superb. Compare Salo with Tinto Brass' Caligula. Both movies were about mankind's dark side, but I felt dirty and debased after watching the latter. Tinto, who is definitely not in the same league as other Italian filmakers like Pasolini, Fellini or Antonioni (and never will be I assure you) first left nothing to the imagination, and then gave the audience some more. On the other hand, Pasolini's Salo is like a lotus - a flower that dares to be beautiful in the face of adversity. This review is based on the Criterion Laserdisc."
4,Pasolini Strikes Political Chord in post-Monica Times,"Savage, primitive, egoistic, racist and full of wonderfully brutish and base imagery, this version of De Sade's infamous work is seeming to ask our own American government to ante up for its own silly, reckless, closeted sexual antics and abuse of power. Not for the weak hearted or politically naive."
3,Disturbing & Alluring,"This movie makes a deep welt in the minds of viewers. Passolini sets the most despicable acts of brutality and filth in a peaceful/beautiful frame of decorum. Mind boggling ... I just wondered what his unfinished film project ""Porno Theo Colossal"" would have been like."
5,Badass DVD,"I won't talk about how daring and powerful this film is, cos there are hundreds of other reviews for that. But I will say the new, remastered hi-def Criterion DVD set looks great and that's all that matters. Included are documentaries and interviews, as well as trailers and other features. The movie, which was taken from an old Marquis De Sade novel and twisted into a kind of fascist, political allegory, has never looked better. And fringe movie fans will enjoy. Almost plays like a cross between the earlier works of Tinto Brass and John Waters. Great DVD/collector item."
3,Hard movie,"This is a very hard to watch movie and is one of my favorites of all time.I have to say that I disagree with Brian's review about ""Salo"" because he said that pasolini creates the situations in the movie, and, that's not true, pasolini takes that situations from sade rather than ""create"" the situations, is Sade who takes those twisted characters from france's politics at his era.I give this movie 3/5 stars because is a very disturbing movie very good but very disturbing."
4,"A brutal, intellectual, ""atmosfearical"" film","This film is disturbing on many levels, only one of which is the ""gore""/""torture"", which frankly is minimal and mostly implied. It is the intellectualism underlying the all-pervasive perversion and sense of no hope which gives the film its terror, together with the real-life subsequent murder of Pasolini shortly after the film's completion. One buying tip - the British Film Institute has released a completely uncut print on DVD, together with extras, which can be obtained from Amazon.co.uk at http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005954M/qid=987457227/sr=1-2/202-4897521-1657461. Despite Salo being out of print in the US, therefore, don't let that stop you buying this masterwork of genuine, intellectual terror."
2,Disturbing,"The enigmatic Pier Paolo Pasolini final piece of work was quite the statement. Pasolini was man not afraid to state his views and did so rather grotesquely in Salo. A film which was difficult to `digest' did have some underlying meaning. Pasolini successfully was able to show the harsh reality of living under a fascist regime and how it feels to be controlled. A fervent Marxist, Pasolini made a political statement in the film and also tried to show the disintegration of society's values. So to put it lightly the film was filled meaning, but the manner in which his message is portrayed is disturbing to say the least."
2,I hate this movie but still buying this movie,"I saw this movie long long time ago.I didn't felt disgusting. I have a strong stomach, so.But I hated it.There's no meaning I thought watching this film.But anyway I am purchaging it.You know why?I donno.I know what the pasism and all and can apply to this movie but still don't liked the film.The picture quality is very good although my pirate version was good too.IS it worth buying it? You decide."
3,"Good movie, but not enough","After reading the book of the Marquis the sade, the 120 days of Sodom, and heard about that this movie was based upon it, i try to get it anywhere. I finally got it at ..., and as i was watching it, i couldnt help but feel dissapointed, just for the fact that the narrative its very long in terms of trying to explain the perversions, rather usuccesfully, and very little to the pervertions itselves. I consider the movie to be mediocre, but nevertheles has its merit just on the fact that Passolinni had the guts to did it. If you are looking for something really perverse, read the book."
2,Quality of film is not high,"Once you get over the highly sadistic components of this film, I question its real artisitc value. For example, I did not think it made good use of the sets and props. The dialogue in English seem very stilted (that may be a result of the translation) and at times the audio (in the original Iralian) was missing altogether (problem with my copy?). Bottom line, it achieves the purpose of exposing humanity at its worst but does not draw you in as I expected from Italian films I have seen before."
2,absolute torture,"Salo makes one question what really is art and the purpose.Is it to inform and entertain and open our minds and arouse the senses? And then wrap it up in a neat bow and watch it for hours and years to come.Pasolini did not really think that way. You only need to see Salo once and it is scorched in your memory forever. You will have flashbacks, nightmares just feel generally unclean. Salo is a classic example of when you ban something eveyone has to see it, it becomes very hip. I could not imagine bringing up this movie in a dinner conversation. And at this level Pasolini's job is done, what people went through during war the unspeakable things they saw and were forced to do the survivors never forgot and carry that shame and guilt there whole lives,Salo allows you to experience in two hours vicariously."
2,I Just Don't Know,"The movie held my interest, but the only reason why was to see what sick thing would happen next. Like more horror movies the further it went the sicker it got and its one of those kinda movies that when its over you feel you need to smoke a pack of cigarettes and take a shower. It makes you feel like your just not clean. If I was asked if I would recremend this to someone else I doubt I would."
3,SALO,A HERKY JERKY MOVIE THAT JUMPS AROUND. IT GOES FROM ON SCEEN TO ANOTHER LEAVING TO MUCH GUESS WORK AS TO HOW THEY TIE TOGETHER.
3,Collectors treat,"Accidentally ordered this Blue ray edition, not realizing it was for the wrong region, but keeping it to collect the book and box art;"
1,Beware,"If you're not familiar with this video, as i wasn't, then beware that it is dark and delves into perversions that few people would find entertaining. Of course, taste is very subjective, but i can't imagine this video content would appeal to very many people. just my two cents,"
4,Meet the real 'Punishers',"The film will scare you, shock you and even make you cringe to no limits. The film practically lays emphasis on 'minors breaking rules and then being punished', that's the plot of the film in eight simple words but what gets it more dramatic is when they realize how worse punishments can get. The film is at most times almost hard to watch, but there is decent emphasis on violence, corruption, physical, emotional and sexual abuse portrayed in the film, one can hate it but cannot ignore it."
4,Deeper Thought Required,"I am fond of this film, and I highly recommend this movie to those who wish to head-on challenge their sensibilities. Also, those who wish to think. The major content of this movie is a real slap in the face, but it's important to understand the underlying allegory, which I'm not as well-equipped as others to explain. Maybe read more about it in warning, then keep the most open mind possible."
1,Very Sickening!,"I rented Saló after reading the reviews on both Netflix and Amazon.com. I thought I was getting a visually stunning, mind opening, erotic masterpiece. What I saw was one of the most disturbing moves ever made. It is sick, twisted and demented to say the least. There is nothing erotic about this movie at all; there is nothing beautiful about this movie at all. I do not believe in censorship and anyone has the right to make a movie on any subject but I do have the right to say this is just not for me and I personally found Saló sickening. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and in fact warned my wife not to watch it because I knew it would make her ill. Please be aware of what you are getting if you buy or rent this movie. I will add my very short synopsis of the movie, a bunch or sick freaks, kidnap and torture some poor young people, with some rape, and murder thrown in."
1,Salo,"I don't get it. Judging from the reviews, some people actually like this movie, or so they say. Well let me tell you what: if you really enjoy this film, that means you're stupid. Unless you're lying to yourself and others, for some reasons, being dumb is your only exuse for praising it.Salo is based on de Sade's book. I've read some parts of it and it was worthless. All it contains is large amounts of boring philosophy, which, I'm sure, no one even bothers to read because it's so dull, and even larger amounts of different abominations that the authors two-dimensional characters do upon each other.The movie is not better. The whole point of it is that the fascists did some bad things. Well duh.So, is this a high class piece of art? My ass. Is it at least as disgusting as they say it is? Yes it is. But if you really need to puke for some reasons, then why don't you just stick two fingers down your throat and save your time."
1,ewwwww,that movie is nasty. that old man who wanted that guy to do him in the stinker at dinner was creepy. i cant believe they ate poo. that movie was worse than hulk with eric bana.
1,"trash, trash, trash!","If you want to see a purely sadistic trash you'll probably love this disgusting movie. If you not, please pay attention: THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS MOVIE ABOUT FASCISM, OR TOTALITARIANISM, OR OPRESSION, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. There's a lot of serious good movies about this subject, like those by Costa Gravas, for instance. Pasolini made a exercise in perversity here. Please, follow my advice: Don`t see this horrible piece of trash. Actually, this film was banished from most countries, with good reason."
2,"What's All the Huh-Bub, Bub?","I'd read alot about Salo before watching it. Every review I'd read proclaimed that it was very profound and that it was the most disturbing film ever made and such. Well, of course you can't rent it anywhere (especially not here in Fairbanks, Alaska), so I had to buy it. While I was watching it, all I could think was ""Will that darn lady ever shut up?"" The woman who talks to the kids for most of the movie annoyed the heck out of me. I was bored to tears. I kept waiting for something to happen. The theme of fascism is not completely lost on me, however. When it came time for the infamous ""feces buffet,"" it's not depicted very grapically so it wasn't very shocking. The violence in the film is mostly shown at a distance, so the viewer is removed from it. Maybe I missed something, but this movie did not shock, disturb or even interest me in the slightest. Maybe I'm just too jaded."
4,Pasolini had no technique for his subject.,"It is far too facile to envision this film as a degradation of the human spirit, Sure it is, but then degradation is all around us. For me an important question why does Pasolini utilize the realm of art to portray theses excesses the dark disgusting realms of the human spirit. What was the Vietnam War, but a molestation of children,of burning of their flesh, with no remorse,nor consciousness. Or any war for that matter. The Balkans is a great profound example, where death is a way of life. What disgusts me is that Pasolini's real disgust is his brutalization of art. His focus is on the purely clinical clean, to the state of painful boredom of his or de Sade's tale. I retrospect I don't think Pasolini had a consummate technique to realize his profound subject. In fact no artist comes to mind. Perhaps Goya his Disasters of War, or the Symphonies of Shostakovich, both as templates for the horros of the times they lived."
5,"Shocking, disgusting, perverted, fantastic","Shocking, disgusting, perverted, fantastic. Salo was a fairly hard movie to watch, but worth at least one go. The messages behind the movie or acts in the movie show very true what those with power have done to todays society with all the greed, coruption and this movie shows what i consider as the true heart of the corrupt.This movie is very extreme with it messages, and is not for the squeemish. I must say however if you do buy the 2 disk dvd set, to make sure you also watch the extras and understand exactly what Pasolini was trying to do with this masterpiece of cinema."
3,Look beneath the surface layer,"Salo may not be the most impressive movie ever made, but it does deserve a degree of praise. Everyone knows that salo is notorious and not for the squeamish, so I won't waste anytime going into details. Once you can get past the grotesque subject matter, you can understand the allegorical context the director is intending to show. Salo as art is more powerful than it is as a movie, however it should still not be overlooked."
3,The most offensive film I've ever seen.,"I consider myself a fairly open-minded individual but this film tests me. Pasolini shocks the viewer with a twisted fictional interpretation of de Sade's ""The 120 Day's of Sodom"". Libertine's will find delight in the acts of sadism committed within the castle deep inside the Black Forest. The town of Salo could never recover from this one. How Pasolini managed to keep the film ""artistic"" with such bad taste has to be seen to be believed. There is a lot of philosophical monologue and dialogue between the intense (very intense) visual scenes of the most disgusting acts imaginable. No Hollywood ending for this flick. END"
1,Not That Disgusting or explict..............,"I watched this movie twice and it is not as explict as all these reviews state. Of course most of the people who viewed this movie must not watch very explict movies that is why it is so shocking and controversial to them. Also when the people are forced to eay human manuver you know that this movie is totally fake and not real yes it would be disgusting if it was real but gimme a break people......... Also the Prices are so riduculus for a stupid no depth movie..Who would pay 1,000 for a dvd....Let's get real people.I reccommend renting before buying..Truly a movie for people who like so-called shock o rama.It is not that bad."
1,Keep ur money in your wallet,This must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I mean with all the hype that i had read up on i thought it would be worth the time. When i started the movie i thought to myself oooo i cant wait to see some gore and watnot. I got nothing wat soever nothing to even think of looking away from the screen. I thought to myself this film is just more of a werid fantasy of a old deranged man who was beaten and abused as a child. To recomend this movie to a friend i would rather save my breath and time which i wont get back from watching this movie. STAY AWAY
1,One of the most boring movies of all time,"Boring and stupid. Certainly there were shocking and disgusting, disturbing moments, but come on. I can't believe I was able to sit through the whole movie."
2,Saw,"If you've seen Saw, you've seen worse than this. I love Pasolini's Medea, so, when you add in the legendary status this film boasts, I was really looking forward to something amazing. Of course, what was shocking in the pre-Saw, Hostel, etc., etc. world doesn't shock as much anymore. The flat performances do little to help this extremely dated seeming film. While the shot composition was obviously a point of lavish attention, often the tableaux are textbook exercises with no real joy in them - and are even repetitive and predictable. To me the film comes off simply pretentious, flat, poorly acted, and vaguely nauseating in a way that annoys without shocking. Caligula is a much better and even more transgressive film, even without the scat play which figures so prominently in this film. If you're wanting something that titillates, yet is more effective as a tragedy, I would recommend that film instead."
1,Blue Ray not playable in Europe,It is quite incomprehensible that Amazone allows shipment of Blu Ray discs that cannot be played on European Blue Ray Players. The stores should make it clear that the items to be shipped overseas are exclusively designed for the US market and thus not playable on European Blue Ray Players.
2,Anyone who rates this 5 stars frightens me!,"A loose adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom, Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò is perhaps the most disturbing and disgusting film ever made. It is also one of the least important."
1,Crap!,"Like the girl that is made to eat chocolate, as if it were excrement, that's what I think of this movie. Imagery and metaphors notwithstanding this movie has no value whatsoever, either artistically or as entertainment, with or without shock value.I wasted good money to buy it and now I am going to break it up and throw it away, better yet burn it! On a final note I must say that I feel sorry and sad for those people that think that it is a great movie and that it represents anything other than crap."
1,There's a reason why the director was assassinated,"I'm a firm believer in freedom of speech, but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities. The product description listed above is completely misleading. It's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims, and then at the end they slowly torture them to death. Pretty much the worst movie I have ever seen."
1,Don't bother,"After reading all these 5 star reviews i was confident I had myself some real, sick, perversely arousing to my macabe taste and this over-priced movie was such a bore i didn't finish it. Maybe that was when it got good, but I doubt it. There was a lot of human waste shots, but, it's obviously fake, the ""torchered"" youths seem to be enjoying themselves, there's no attempt at penitration, no terror,& no reckless tastelessness.I don't get it I guess, I was literally bored to sleep."
2,Over Rated!,"I could have lived without seeing this movie. The acting isn't fantastic, the plot is weak, The sub plots are weaker still."
1,Unredeemingly awful,"The Bottom Line:A disgustingly bad combination of De Sade and Italian Fascism, the 120 Days of Sodom is quite frankly the worst movie I have ever seen (and I've seen over 2000); simultaneously pretentious (the director seems to believe that the 30 minutes or so during which characters eat human feces are a deep metaphor) sickeningly vile, and dull, it's basically the most depraved pornography you can imagine masquerading as an art film.(no stars) out of 4"
2,Has to be seen to be beieved!,This has to be one of the sickest flicks on celluloid. I couldn't believe such a fim existed. It's no wonder that Pasolini was murdered not long after the release of the movie.
2,Did not match my expectations!,"I bought this movie because it keep on popping on several forums and being described as masterpiece. In my opinion it is not. There is no real story line, it just shows how sick and perverted some people are and having the power to fulfill them. The fame of this film is because it got pull-out theaters for being too graphic; but that was back in the 70s, now days I have seen films that are more graphic than this one. It just goes to show how time has change.If you saw the film back when it was in theaters (the 70s), then buy it. It might be of your taste. But if you were born after the 70s (like me), then you may not find it not worth buying. Just rent it."
1,Garbage,I am an avid fan of the extreme and a certified gorehound. I am sick of reading how this film makes any political statement whatsoever. It has NO meaning at all! It is celluloid garbage. In a word? Perversion. Simple. I give it one star because of it's shock value for 1975. That's it. Cannibal Holocaust had WAY more social meaning than this! At least we never have to ingest anything else from it's overrated director.
1,Sick,"Do not listen to the other reviews on this page unless you like to see the sexual torture of innocent children.This film is beyond art. Pasolini only did this movie to get attention for his political beliefs. Andy Warhol has better film work then this.Watch it once, feel very sick and dirty, then take a shower, and be a better person for understanding that you dislike the movie."
1,Don't buy this film,This film should Not be in the Criterion Collection. It seemed to me that is was made just for shock value. it is a waste of money and whomever thinks this is a good movie is crazy. The movie if about a group of facist men and women who take multiple children for a type of sexual experiment. throughout the movie the adults constantly refer to themselves as facists. I can not stress enough that this movie is a complete waste of money.
1,The Most Disgusting Thing I've Ever Seen,This DVD is the most disgusting horrible movie I've ever witnessed. I walked in on my son watching it and it is utterly dispicable!!
1,shame on criterion collection,"only 2 minutes ago, i saw this movie being bought at the price of 872$ on ebay, and i couldnt believe my eyes!!!!!!!!!! the seller bought two copies from amazon.com 5 years ago by paying 30$ for each , kept one to himself and the second one just stayed untouched waiting for years in a shelf as the seller described so...what makes it unique is that it is still factory sealed and it has the white ring with 29 chapters...anyway my concern is why does criterion let this happen? why dont they reprint the movie and sell it? why do you let people earn money in this way?? i dont want to pay more than its original price of 30$...and i want the original one with the white ring not a bootleg copy...so hear my voice criterion and dont let people become rich through this movie, stop this nonsense"
3,"Not a favorite, but unforgettable.","It's ironic that someone like Pasolini, a communist and humanist of the first order, would produce a film so disgusting and disturbing, and which was so vile in its statement about the human condition. Maybe he became so overwhelmed by the subject matter that he grew more interested in portraying atrocities than in any message that he had intended at the beginning of the film. I've only seen it once, but it refuses to leave me, years later. It does have the traditional slower pacing common in foreign films, but if you ""enjoy"" films that disturb you, you should track this one down."
1,Hideous Film!!!,"I am very much in favor of uncensored art and allowing artists to realize their visions, regardless of how offensive they may be. But, this film by Pasolini crossed a line for me. It gave totally new meaning to the word ""gratuitous."" It was so replete with violence and depravity that it felt like a meaningless, albeit powerful, assault on my psyche. And for what - to prove what we already know, that Mussolini's fascists were vulgar excuses for human beings? I think films that deliver strong messages through the power of suggestion are much more effective and thought provoking than Passoini's ""Salo."" Don't get me wrong, I certainly thought a great deal about the film after seeing it, but not in an intellectually rigorous way. My thoughts were more focused on how physically ill it made me feel. In fact, I had real trouble sleeping for a couple of weeks after seeing it. I don't think I need to be shocked to a point of requiring therapy in order to realize how terrible fascism can be."
2,"Man, this is sick stuff!!!!","I set out on a mission to seek out the most shocking films Amazon had to offer. Well folks, we've got a winner. And believe me, don't watch this while you are eating!!! I got physically sick (retching) while watching certain scenes. I guess the only redeeming thing about this film is that it shows us a side of human nature that is best left unexplored. The evil that comes with absolute domination of other human beings was adequately portrayed in this film, to the point that I had to ask myself if maybe the director isn't better off dead!"
1,"Self-Indulgent, Sloppy, and Intentionally Sickening","Tedious in the extreme, incredibly distasteful, often sickening,utterly without point, and (surprisingly, given its publicity) extremelyunerotic. It is a film I frankly wish I had never seen. Disgusting and without any redeeming value, purient or otherwise."
3,A very legalistic view of having children,"We are a family that does not use ""chemical"" methods of birth control for various reasons. I was looking forward to reading this book. But I found that she took many scripture references out of context. And her views were very legalistic and almost made me feel like a horrible person for considering the timing and spacing of my children. Most of our evangelical christian family does not ""like"" children. So I was hoping to find a reference for them to read. But I would never recommend this book to anyone else. They would find it incredibly offensive.A better book I have found is The Contraception Guidebook, The : Options, Risks, and Answers for Christian Couples; by William Cutter. It presents the facts in a very straight forward manner and leaves the reader to make their own decisions."
5,Second Skin,Best applied with a large stippled brush for maximum blending. Melts into skin and lasts all day (can be retouched without cakey build-up) over VL primer. Shade selection is not that critical as most take on the basic tone of one's own skin. Especially good on dry types. Does not settle into lines. No perfumy odor.
3,It's okay.,"This is not a scholarly or even research based book. It is purely the experience of the author, which is pretty substantial. It is a good resource, but does not hold the scholarly underpinnings that will make it stand the test of time."
4,Jazzy and full of Soul,"Having listened to his two earlier CD's, this one is slightly different. The songs are simple and full of Soul with a taste of Jazz. This is the kind of Music, that gets better the more You listen to it."
5,Grande Bola! Grande Francisco!,"""Permiso concedido, mi querido Francisco"" diría el Bola. Pocas voces hoy en día tendrían tremenda licencia. Francisco Céspedes no solo cuenta con un timbre distintivo, hermoso y original sino que respira puro filin al interpretar el bolero y ahora al rendir este finísimo homenaje. Con este disco, dudo que Francisco desee imitar, copiar o hacer mímica de uno de los artistas más complejos y sui géneris que parió Cuba.El formato de arreglos instrumentales a cargo de Jacobo Calderón y del genio del piano, Gonzalito Rubalcaba, redondean la belleza vocal e interpretativa de Céspedes. Y por último, si no se nos llenan los ojitos de lágrimas al escuchar al dúo Bola/Francisco gracias a la magia de la tecnología, es que tenemos que afinar nuestros oídos."
4,A good start.,"Unlike most of the other titles in this series, Colloquial Afrikaans provides the new learner with a solid knowledge of the basic grammar, essential for a further study. The plural of nouns and the flexion of adjectives should be covered more thouroughly however, but this course with its lively dialogues and everyday vocabulary is one of the best one could choose to start that interesting language."
4,debbie's masterwork?,"even if it does have a 'transition album' quality feel to it, it blows her first two albums out of the water. out of its ambitious 16 tracks, there are very few i don't like. she really flexes her songwriting muscle on this one. her penchant for musical theatre really starts to show itself as well. the one thing that bothers me about this album is her vocal delivery... a little too breathy. i miss debbie's special brand of pop... no one does it quite like her!"
4,the little girl with a lot of oomph!,"anyone who tries to lump debs with other average '80s artistes is so wrong!she was/is a true artist, writing all her own material, playing most of her own music, and looking pretty good too!this album has the ""bubble gum"" element to it, but that's partly what's good about, the ""old skool""/teenage crush element.i love her ballads, as they sound so heart-felt, but her pop tunes always feel like just having a fun time ""hanging with your girlfriends"" .I miss debs being around in the mainstream, and i don't care what anyone thinks, i'll keep on listening to electric youth & pretend i'm still a teenager!"
5,i love this album,"i love this album. it has some very good songs on it. i like the songs anything is possible, one hand one heart,one step ahead,and another brick falls. i think you will enjoy this if you pick it up."
3,An ok made up movie....maybe,"The story was shifty, the acting was less than oscer winning. I think the only good thing on this dvd is that hot tube sceen were we at least can see some nudity."
2,Pathetic and Fake,"""The Lost Season"" is simply pathetic and pointless. The ""roomates"" are simply actors, tricking many through MTV's advertising campaign for this movie.The plot is silly, stupid and overall bad. This movie doesn't deserve to have the title ""Real World"" as it puts a mark on all the other seasons.End of story. Don't buy this. Don't watch this."
1,"So bad, not even MTV shows it anymore!","This movie was horrible and stupid. Not even MTV shows it anymore and they were the ones who aired it. Anyone who thinks of buying, don't waste your time. ..."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"I watched this when it debuted on MTV. It's stupid. It's nothing but a MOVIE! They based the movie--or dramatic reinactment--on actual footage recovered from the guy who kidnapped the Real World cast. Well, you never see any real footage.I strongly recommend this to someone who just wants to see a POOR,... movie about the a season of the Real World gone wrong...no one dies either.If the DVD has original footage...then I give it 2 stars because, quite frankly...no one cares."
2,Great but the size is misleading,"I bought this to prevent spills and floods under my kitchen sink. The 16"" H x 20"" W x 2.75"" D dimensions are misleading and incorrect. The entire caddy is much larger. It can detach in pieces and I was able to use them though. One fit under my kitchen sink pipe, another under the food grinder and pipes and the third is under a bathroom sink. Each tray works and fits great but this was mostly luck."
2,Does NOT glow in the dark,"You have to admit that this is a pretty ugly ring. The color looks off next to my olive skin. I wouldn't have bought it except that it was supposed to glow in the dark. This, it does not do. I have exposed it to plenty of light and tested it in total darkness, and I still couldn't see a thing. What a disappointment! Would have been better if at least it had been a better color, like pink."
5,Absolute master of this repertory at his peak,"Superbly played, this recording in pristine sound represents Berglund's most mature interpretation of the complete Sibelius cycle, masterworks whose greatness increases with time. Berglund's readings have always been benchmarks, with this superb orchestra in modern sound, these readings will stand out at the top of a crowded field. These readings have all of Barbirolli's affection and detail with a far more virtuosic orchestra. Must have recordings."
4,Badly bound!,"I've got the hard-back verion, and if you don't hold it carefully, pages can come unstuck (they're not hard to put back in, thou').Quite a good history otherwise."
5,Sourdough Heaven,"This is a wonderful reference book for sourdough enthusiasts. From the many sourdough starters to the wide variety of recipes given - breads (the sourdough whole wheat is the best bread I've ever made!), quick breads, muffins, cakes, cookies, desserts and main courses; this is a book you will use regularly. With such a variety of recipes, it is easy to use the starter once a week as suggested. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone with an interest in sourdough."
5,Happy with book,I cannot find a place to leave a feedback so I will tell you I received the book very fast and I am very happy with it.
5,Enjoyable for baby,I bought this along with companion books by the same author. These are wonderful to start reading to your baby and to let the baby handle the book. These are great for wanting to plant the seed early of loving Christ and keeping Him in the forefront of your baby's life. Highly recommend!
2,Action without Immersion,"The story picks up right where the last book leaves off, but it's more summary than suspense. I think this author got a little too lazy about telling and not showing, especially in the later half of the novel where everything is summarized. I still don't understand how exactly the Drifter ship ended up at it's final (end book) destination given who is the real 'owner' of the ship.Anyway, I'd only read this if you liked the earlier volumes of the series, and even then, don't expect much.On a personal note, one of the things that really annoyed me about the novel was one of the main alien characters is named Wexial, which constantly reminded me of the magic cardWrexial, the Risen Deep - Worldwake Mythic Rareand generally made the story much harder to get into."
3,How to ruin a good story.,"This is the third book a series that was lots of fun. But at a point that seemed to be about half way through the story, it seems like the author got tired of writing and just summed up the entire last half of it. This ruined the entire series for me."
3,"Nice, but not like the other two",It's was an ok read but not as good as the others. I should mention that I read this book when I was just starting to read english books so that might have twisted my oppinion.
4,"Nixon, Kissinger and de Gaulle","None of the star diplomats grasped that China plays 'go', not chess. Now that major urban centers on the Canadian and US West Coasts are being re-populated by ethnic Chinese, it might be time to wake up. Because the same thing is happening in Siberia, and in Western European cities. Emigrants from China (100s of millions strong) are re-mapping the world.Is the Chinese restaurant history's greatest Trojan horse? Is Peking behind the population shift, as favouring the export of surplus labour and potential unrest? Has the the end game begun? We await the definitive inquiry."
2,Not As Advertised,"The features described on the Amazon page are patently misleading. The effective range in total darkness, is NOT 100 ft, but more like 15ft. The image is NOT the quality they tout in fact it is fuzzy even under the best conditions. I am puzzled as to why the higher priced cameras offered by Swann are rated LOWER than this one. In their favor is the fact that the camera housing is metal, not plastic. It's unfortunate they didn't put in a better sensor. The one they used is no better than the X-10 garbage. Also, don't bother to complain to Swann because they will not answer any questions, and will refer you to the website instead which often doesn't have all the information. Before you buy, check out the manufacturers website...and then keep on shopping for something else that actually lives up to the hype."
2,Product Description is WRONG!,"I bought this camera based on its specs, which appeared to be pretty good. However, there is a glaring problem between the Amazon description, and the one printed on the package. The Amazon description reads ""lets you see up to 100 feet (30 meters) in total darkness"". The packaging clearly reads ""the 11 infra-red LEDs project invisible light up to 2-3m/6-9ft"". I don't know about anybody else, but I find there is a big difference between 9 feet and 100 feet! I haven't actually tried the camera outside, to see how far it will be able to record images in the dark, but I was expecting 100 feet when I bought it (paid extra for that). I'm probably going to have to buy a different camera now - one that will work at a greater distance in the dark."
5,The only fence to buy,"I had another well respected brand fence sitting in the box waiting until I had a workshop large enough to accommodate the longer than stock rails. When I took it out to install it on the saw, a 1940's Delta Unisaw, I just couldn't having previously used the Biesemeyer in a friends shop. So, I went and ordered the Biesemeyer. The installation was much simpler that the other fence. It did take a little tweaking to align the fence, table and blade, not too bad though. However, now every cut is perfect just by using ruler on the guide. I even tested it 2"", 12"", 24"" from the blade....perfect every time. Plus the Biesemeyer is built like a tank and the quality of everything is first rate."
3,Unhappy,"I found that this rip fence did not fit my table saw. I called Biesemeyer company and they told me that I would need to buy another $50 part and customize it. They did not sell a kit that would work for my table saw. Cutting into 3/16 steel isn't something that is easy for me to do.Because of these problems I returned this product to Amazon. After filling out the return information on the web, Amazon stated that they would pay for return shipping. It was expensive. Harry Pierce"
2,"GOOD MUSIC, HORRIBLE SOUND / RECORDING","I HAVE COLLECTOR'S 2001 EDITION IN MY HI-FI. THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE, LOOKS LIKE A BAD MP3 RECORDING ... I HAVE A QUITE EXPENSIVE HI-FI SO THE PROBLEM IS THE CD, THE REMASTERING OF COLL. ED., SIMPLY A DISASTER ..."
3,experiment in the practice of writing vs. enjoyable read,"sarraute's contribution it the nouveau roman and the radicalisaton of the traditional novel is beyond question, what is doubtful is whether such formal experimantation is conducive to enjoyment of the book as entertainment. interesting but dry"
4,A gem of a movie... refreshing!,Judi Dench has a presence on screen that makes any movie she stars in well worth seeing. This is no exception. This movie is very innocent and simple but has a tender undertone. The two ladies are stark contrasts to one another and really lend an intriguing dimension to the film. Great flick. Must see!
4,Ladies in Lavender -DVD,"Ladies in Lavender, has something that is very rare for a modern movie to have, it has an actual plot. No car chases, no CGI, just a story, and beautiful photography to hold your interest. So if you like pre-World War II period pieces, violin music, and beautiful photography of Cornwall, England. Then, may I suggest that you check out Ladies in Lavender. I don't think you will be disappointed."
3,a bad situation turned good,"I'd purchased this item from another vendor. through Amazon.com. The dvd didn't arrive on the stated date, and I sent three emails through the proper channels, a few days apart, as I was waiting for a response in between. Never a response from the vendor. Contacted Amazon.com to let them know the situation with one of their recommended vendors. They refunded me the money spent, sent me a dvd from them, and I got in in a few days, after waiting over a month for the other vendor. Put your stock in Amazon. Awesome!"
2,Ladies in Lavender,"I happen to love Dame Judi Dench. You may know her as the matron in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, or you may know her as James Bond's female boss, M. I recently reviewed SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and noted that her presence (as Queen Elizabeth, naturally) showed up the woeful lack of ability in a few costars. In this film, she's teamed with Maggie Smith, another fine British actress. Well, 15 minutes into this dog, I was bored out of my skull and stopped watching. Sorry, ladies."
1,"Sloooow, and never reaches its destination","Awful movie. Sloooow pacing with a bunch of little twists that never panned out. This story about a May/December love mismatch has potential, but the writer/director put way too many barriers in the way - besides the age difference there's also a language barrier and a different-career barrier (he's a budding violinist, she stays home and gardens). Plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him. And why make the pretty stranger seem so evil when all she wanted was to take the fellow under her wing and help him fly? Why add the pretense of danger (Oh no! They might be German spies!) if you aren't going to do anything with it? This story couldn't really decide where it wanted to go so it meandered around for a while and ended up going nowhere."
3,Ladies,"This had good actors in it, but the sound seemed garbled, so it was hard to understand the dialogue."
4,Ladies In Lavender DVD,"This is a movie for those who love gentle English dramas with actors who look like real people, not Tom Cruise clones. It is charming, amusing and uplifting. Takes the fear out of growing older."
4,Pleasant story,"Ok, I have no idea what the Lavender part of the title means since they never wear lavender, but it's a cute story nonetheless. Maggie Smith and Judi Dench do a fantastic job in their roles as always. The supporting cast is great as well. I think the movie could've done just a little more explaining the ladies' lives before the start of the movie, but you get enough along the way to get it."
2,Disappointing medium for two master actors,"I watched this movie because it had Judy Dench and Maggie Smith together. Very disappointing. The director gets a star for them and good cinematography, though the latter could have been accidental due to a beautiful setting. But two masters couldn't add enough dynamics to overcome a silly plot and poor script. The potential conflicts were weak, character development was poor, and the dynamics between Dench's character and the young man reminded me of Harold and Maude without the comedy, leaving it merely disgusting. And the ladies didn't wear lavender."
4,GOOD,"A GOOD BIT OF ACTING, AND NICE SCENERY. IT NEEDED MORE SCENERY. AFTER ALL , IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO FILM. AND THE VIEWER WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE VISUAL ESCAPE."
4,Ladies in Lavender,"As I am a big fan of Judi Dench I appreciate her acting in all her films. In this one, I could relate to her agony and feelings of love even though she was a much older woman. I admire her for this role with no pretense of trying to look glamorous. Maggie Smith is as usual very talented and it is a double treat to have them in the same film. For lovers of violin music you will enjoy it in this film. I wished it could have gone on longer."
5,Great Movie!,"Great acting and a really charming plot. If you like movies like Calendar Girls, Best Marigold Hotel and Mrs. Henderson Presents you will like this one."
5,Best Yet,"I love Judi Dench and Maggie Smith so I got a double delight in this film. I loved it so much that I was disappointed when it ended because I wanted this wonderful story to go on. Every character was so perfectly portrayed it was as though I was actually there and participating with the real-life people of this time. This is a keeper DVD, and I'm sure I will watch it again in the future."
2,A little disappointed....,"I love these ladies and have many of their movies. It is a bit of an odd story but left me feeling like I was waiting for something more to happen. The performances were wonderful, as always, but I felt a little disappointed in the story itself."
5,Ladies In Lavender is great!,"It's a sweet story, good acting, takes you back to a different time. I have watched it several times and it seems to never get old."
3,Enjoyable film,"Wonderful performances by Dame Judy Dench and Maggie Smith. The Cornwall, England country side and the little house makes me wanted to visit the area. The movie description reads beautifully, but was executed in a disappointing fashion. The story fails to grab the viewer and bring depth to the experiences and interactions. I couldn't identify with the violinist as a personality. He projects the image of an overgrown selfish young adult. A start contrast to the sensitive way in which he plays his violin. The story line is tenuous and doesn't satisfy."
3,Bad descriptive language,"Some of the language used to describe the narrative elements is confusing and unclear. It reads like it was written by a philosophy major, for whom English is a second language."
4,"a bit skeptical at first, but...","I was concerned at first because there is no word processing capability, and I was worried that it was going to be alot of extra work, but I've found it really helpful. It not only helps me order my ideas, but it clarifies them, before I've written 1000 words and not had them make sense. It also helps when it is a complicated story so that your story lines interweave gracefully, without getting lost in a maze of concepts. I am a beginner, and it is great for me, but I believe that I will be using this for a long time."
5,Even the demo makes this software shine,"I have heard about Dramatica Pro for years and never touched it. Now, I finally gave in to get the demo--and stayed up till 3:00 o'clock in the morning! I could not afford to lose the valuable information it was giving me. For those who know their story ahead of time, great! Dramatica helps you know it better. I knew my story dealt with the issues of trust and identity. I knew how these things played out. What I didn't know was that about Impact Characters and the total relationships between my themes, my characters, and the action going on. Using Dramatica forced me to answer questions that probed even deeper into my story than I had known how to go. For this alone, I would buy the software. Particularly so I can go to sleep at night and continue in the morning."
3,Writing in a Box,"If you care the type of writer who likes everything spelled out before you start the creative process, this software may work for you. Of particular interest is the character developing section where you can even assign photos to your characters. Writing by the numbers or freestyle, this feature will assist you in your endeavors.For those of you who write as I do--by the seat of your pants--letting your characters decide where the story goes, not knowing for sure how it will end until you get there, Dramatica will prove frustrating, restrictive, and a waste of money."
2,"Looks nice, poorly balanced","This sword is pleasing to look at, but not very good as a practice weapon. The weighting is poor--the handle is way too light (being plastic) and it is not hollow enough to allow for adding some weight internally. Don't buy this sword if you actually plan on using it."
2,not what I thought,spend a few more dollars and buy the Red Chinese Tai Chi Swords. It's only a little more and it is a much better deal! I bought both at the same time.
2,unbalanced sword,"This sword is nice for display only, the body is too long while the handle is small and short which make it unbalance when practice,you can use to""cut"" like broadsword but have hard time to ""point"" for a strike.Don't recomended it..."
1,I would not recommend this item,blade is not carbon steel but stainless and wobbles so much it may fall out of the sword completely
4,Good enough,Nothing fancy. Good enough. Don't like the synthetic tassle material because it snags too easily.
1,Disappointing,This book really has nothing in particular to do with the Silicon Valley recruiters. It is just a list of recruiters from all over the country. It is not what the title claims to be.
5,A Classic with Art!,"The most widely read Christian book after the Bible now has glorious medieval illustrations on every page that complement the profound meditations by Thomas A Kempis. A wonderful book for spiritual reading, and also as a beautiful gift book. Divided up by several thematic spiritual topics, this book is great for just quiet meditation on how to better imitate Christ in our daily lives, and the pictures offer great images for helping the meditation. Just a handsome book all around. One of the best editions of this classic by A Kempis I have ever seen. Very highly recommended!"
3,sufficient,"Even my linguistics teacher says this isn't a great book for learning Old English, however there aren't a lot of options for such a dead language!"
5,a must have,When i singed up to take EMT classes i needed a mask for the CPR class after looking on line i found this one. i love the case that that the mask is in. i cna throw it in my bookbag and be on my way. you can not go wrong with this.
5,Every Scuba Diver Should Have at Least One,"In preparation for my upcoming PADI Rescue Diver course, I took CPR/AED and O2. I learned the importance of keeping a pocket mask in my gear bag. I called around town to a couple of medical supply stores and none of them carry it. So I checked on Amazon and came across this one. I bought two, one for me and one for my wife. Shipping was prompt and the masks were in perfect condition."
2,Unwatchable on the computer,"I purchased the Beginner/Intermediate and the Advanced DVDs from HAL Leonard which were mastered by BCI Media LLC. The DVDs were recorded improperly. The camera shots are fine, if somewhat pedestrian which is normal for how-to videos.However, when the narrator is showing computer screens, the capture program cannot lock the horizontal stabilizer. The computer screens jittery up and down so much my eyes were bugging out. I was trying to watch the DVD lessons on the computer then try to execute the same tasks on the computer. This was not possible.It DVD is watchable in the TV but still has noticeable horizontal stability problems. This defeats the purpose of watching and practicing since you would have to move from the TV to the computer each time you wanted to try something.The DVD should be called ""Beginner Video Recording Project"" since it is a very amateurish production, hardly one expects to get stuck with these days."
3,Sonar Book,"This book like many other I have looked at, assumes that I am an experienced user of Sonar and is written in such a way that I have a diffucult time understanding and following the instructions. I have described this book as the ""War and Peace"" of Sonar."
4,Satisfying,"For once, I like all of the authors who contributed to this book. I got it because I wanted to read about Maris McKenzie. It was very satisfying to me. I love the McKenzie family.Debbie Macomber and Linda Howard also contributed a good story each. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is the stories were too short. I prefer these authors in longer formats."
2,"Reviewing only ""Mackenzie's Magic"" story...","Mackenzie's Magic was the weakest in the series so far. There was little plot development, weak character development, no tension at all, the ""romance"" between the hero and heroine just wasn't there. There was nothing there except supposedly lust, but Howard didn't make me believe even that much existed between them. The pacing was so slow and boring that I made myself finish it just so I could catch up with other characters in previous story. Hopefully the last in the series will be better."
3,Weak Plot Development,"All of the Mackenzie books in the series are really really good, and this book feels like it could have been a really good book, but it was very short and didn't have a chance to fully develop into a good story."
4,Not bad for short stories,"Ok I only read Howard and Turner but I have to say I was torn. Its not that the Howard read was bad, but it was soo rushed and shallow despite being well over 100 pages and although entertained I was disappointed for a Mackenzie series edition. The others were so detailed and you became so involved. This was so superficial I never really cared except to see the other charaters in the series that I loved in the other books. Now Turner really showed you how a short story is done! She has fewer pages than Howard but the characters and story were very developed and entertaining. The book was worth it just for that story which I really loved and would like to read more by the author in the future."
4,Good continuation of the Mackenzie's,"I enjoyed this book. It was fun to catch up to the youngest Mackenzie. I wish the book had been more a full length story, but it was good for a short story."
1,Boring,Save yourself the $2 and get one of the free kindle books instead. This book was a waste of my time.
2,Not up to the mark of the rest of the series..disappointing,Read all the series and disappointed with this one felt it was rushed by the author..disappointing if you've read the others i would give this one a miss..
4,GSHOCK!!!,Good watch.Hasn't scratched up ever.It's easy to configure.It's a great watch so far.Worth your money.
5,A1 item.,"This is a good all-around watch. Not for dress, but for work or the gym. Will also light up at night. Would buy again."
5,Be.Entertained,"I stumbled over this DVD while changing planes in Frankfurt airport. A glance at the cover and description told me it was something I'd enjoy, and I was right. It's more or less ""Human Traffic"" at the Love Parade. Drama, comedy, and possibly an angel. And music you'll want to play loud. I got shivers when I recognized the start of ""Der Klang Der Familie"". If you own ""Groove"" and ""Human Traffic"", you need this. I'm puzzled that it received no distribution outside Germany. (I was reading several UK dance magazines around that time (Mixmag, Muzik, Ministry) and never saw any reference to this movie.)Don't be put off by the German language soundtrack; a lot of the dialogue is in English, and there's subtitles for the rest. Region-free DVD players can be easily found; just jot down the model numbers of the cheap DVD (and Blu-ray) players at big box stores, and google. Or, just rip the DVD and watch it on a computer, or media player like a WDTV."
1,Mrs Picky,"Beautiful when new but dry clean only! Its a dog coat. So I tried washing by hand because it only cost $1.70. It diden't do well. You have to wash their clothes , I would not of purchaced if I kenw dry clean only.Sorry, but all of the other cloths She has even with the same kind of trim wash great."
2,Waiting for seller to make purchase right,I have been in contact with the seller and they have promised to make the purchase right. I am waiting for that to happen.
4,Very cute & warm!,"I have this sweater for my teacup chihuahua, she gets cold and this sweater keeps her warm (when she'll keep it on..) I did have some problems with the trim on this sweater, my husband threw the sweater in the washing machine.. not supposed to do that. The trim tore off of the sweater because of that.I got some thread and a needle and fixed it, no biggie. I would say that the material of the sweater is good (cotton?) it's still in good condition, and the sweater isn't exactly new anymore.Honestly the sweater is better than some others i've had in terms of how much abuse it can take."
4,Good songs from the mainstream world,"I purchased this Inxs' album when it was released because I liked a lot the single ""Disappear""that climbed the Hot 100 'till to number 8;i was very surprised to discover that many songs were good as the single i prefered.""Lately"" is a pop tune with a great chorus,""Hear that sound"" is a contagious classic Inxs'song,""By my side"" is a tender love song"" and ""Bitter tears"" is a semi-rock song that makes you stand up and move.I was very sorry at the new of Michael Hutchence's death;I always thought he was one of the most charismatic singer in the pop-rock music."
4,X,"X is a weird album. Coming off of KICK was gonna be tough, no matter how you sliced it. X had SUICIDE BLONDE going for it, but other than LATELY, no guaranteed commercial smash tracks. That being said, everytime I want to skip over a track or choose a few songs for a ""best of INXS"" mix, I always wind up choosing 3/4 of the album to include. One of the great things about INXS is that even if it wasn't huge hit material, they always wrote interesting music. WHO PAYS THE PRICE and FAITH IN EACH OTHER would never work on radio, but they're great, interesting tracks! This started on LISTEN LIKE THIEVES and carried over into all their subsequent albums, the only exception being the monster KICK which has more pop classics than filler on it. X may take a few more listens than KICK to get ingrained in you, but it's well worth the time invested!"
4,"inxs ""X"" - the review","Back in 1990, the 80's were behind us and the 90's were on the horizon. it was a period of transition musically, as genres were being combined to create new sounds. it was also the year before lollapalooza, raves going mainstream and grunge breaking.it was a simpler time.Having the multi-platinum worldwide smash that was ""Kick"", inxs had some big expectations to live up to. They do so with ""X"", though not as popular as ""Kick"" it still had some gems, in particular ""Disappear"" ""Bitter Tears"".this album showcases a band in transition as they were changing their sound. All in all this is a good album form a band that stood apart from their contemporaries. it was during this tour that they established themselves as one of the best live bands."
3,Solid effort,"I'm kind of partial to this CD cause I saw the X tour live when this CD came out, but these songs kind of sound like ones they would have left off the KICK CD, such was the high standard of that CD. These songs are all good, the one that really stands out for me is 'Lately' which has a Devil Inside vibe to it. 'By my side' is a beautiful balad, Bitter tears is another highlight. It was always going to be difficult to follow up KICK, but X is more of a mature sound for the band, it's still a good effort."
5,A great CD with some amazing harmonica playing!!!,"Ordinarily I don't review CD's that aren't put out by harmonica players, but the harmonica playing by Charlie Musselwhite on ""Suicide Blonde"" makes this album, superb in it's own right, an absolute must-have for harmonica fans."
3,The downsides....,"...Michael Brandon's narration. He makes Oliver sound western and stupid, Toad sound like a nerd, Duncan soundIrish /Scottish, and Skarloey and Rusty sound too high-pitched. But the good thing is that, unlike Alec Baldwin, uses a Scottish voice for Donald and Douglas. I really appreciate that. Another downside is the new music. I don't know why HIT Entertainment wants to realease the Season 7 stories on VHS/DVD with the new Season 8/9 background music. It really sucks. At least at the end is a Season 7 song like ""Percy Saves the Day"" and ""Hooray for Thomas"". It's called ""Troublesome Trucks"". It's very catchy. I would reccomend this, but I'd rather you get the British version that still has the old music."
1,Thomas the train video and NOT FERGUS included in the video like the picture shows??,"I was very dissapointed when I thought I was actually buying what the picture stated. They did take 50@ off, but not I have two Toby's and my son was so excited to get a Fergus. It broke his heart and I cannot find Fergus. So, be leary of buying this video, unless you care about the video and not the train."
3,Third Generation 10 G Ipod,"I thought this would work with all Ipods as described. It did not have an adapter for a 10 G third generation Ipod, but it seemed to be ok with one of the 20G's. When I have it docked it charges but and plays, but does not respond to the Ipod buttons and only plays one song and stops. When I use it with the supplied cable it works fine but does not charge. I have to charge it docked and play it with the cable. I emailed customer service at the company and have not received a reply. It has been about 10 days. Other than that it sounds good for its size."
2,Unimpressed,"I bought this speaker system to accessorize my new iPod Classic, and I returned it a day or two later. Even though I got it at nearly half the current listed price, I was very disappointed with the weak and tinny sound quality. I already own a less expensive Dynex ""wedge"" speaker system, which I had bought for my old Shuffle - I thought it first that it was incompatible with the Classic, but when I realized I could use it, I found I got speaker sound from it that was at least as good as the CTA unit. I also recently purchased a ""iPod boom box"" for the bargain price of $20 which has speakers with much better bass response - and it has an AM/FM radio to boot. So there are products on the market that are at least as good or better, and much cheaper, than this one."
1,A very useless and bad product,"This is very nice looking but very badly performing product. Initilly when i set it up it would occasionally make some noise after couple of weeks it started giving a very annoying and irritating noise. Almost a useless product, i agree its price is very attractive but its a bad product for any price."
2,Not good quality sound,I'm not sure if there was something wrong with the product I received but it made a loud clicking and buzzing sound when the Ipod was inserted. The only way to not hear this sound was to crank up the volume but the speakers just aren't good enough to make turning it up that loud sound good.
3,I got what I paid for,"I was looking for an inexpensive, room-suited ipod speaker and this is what I got. The volume is loud enough, but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion. My biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my 2nd generation iPod Nano. A new dock was added I see, but the iPod cannot be played with the dock unless I hold down the top. It works fine without the dock, but it's shaky and unstable. So besides the annoyances, this is a fine speaker for the amount I paid."
4,SMALL BUT IMPRESSIVE,"I purchased this item so that I could listen to my IPOD at work. It accomplishes the job perfectly! It's just the right size to put on my desk and for a small unit, it has a nice sound. I like the fact that it's portable too. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a battery option...it would have been nice to be able to take on the beach. Overall, I am very pleased with this product!"
4,Great for the price,I am very happy with this product. Works great and sounds descent for the price.
1,you get what you paid for ...total garbage.,"I bought this as a gift for my 10 yr old son, since he wanted a docking station/speakers for his nano. I figured for $30, it was a steal. I guess you get what you pay for. When it was 1st hooked up the sound came out ok for like a minute or so. So we figured everything was fine. He unplugged and put it in his room. Sound was so distorted & garbled it was like scratching your nails against a blackboard. I tried my Ipod(30gb) same thing. My son was totally bummed out. Needless to say I sent it back on the 1st thing smoking to Amazon for a refund."
1,Not good for new iPods,"I bought this item for a Christmas gift. It was cute and exactly what I wanted. However, it does not work with the iPod nano 5th generation even though it says it works with all iPods. The device does not sit on the docking station well, thus it does not charge. If we want to use the speakers, the iPod has to sit beside the docking station as the plugs do not match up, which defeats the purpose of having a docking station. All in all, we were disappointed with this product which is a shame because the size and shape are perfect for the small space we wanted to place it in."
1,Worked for two weeks,"Sound was average for 2 weeks, not it cuts in and out, and goes from silent to deafening. Cheap product, not worth the price."
1,"crackly speakers, terrible sound","When I received this item, the left speaker crackled slightly and I just let it go, I figured it wasn't a big deal. A week later, the left speaker sounded TERRIBLE. It was crackling and garbling like crazy. I could barely understand the ""music"" coming out of it. The right speaker died completely. I sent it back."
4,Great,This a a geats speaker for it's price. the sound quality is good and it also charges your ipod while using it. the only reason i rated it a 4 star is because between songs it makes static noises
4,Pretty darn good,"I think this product is pretty darn good, considering the price point. I like it because it charges the ipod while docked. Music quality is great for my purposes--it just sits on my desk in my office at work."
3,It's good when it works,"We have an IPod mini and there is a problem with the sound being very low or hearing only the background sounds. We re-adjust, fiddle around with it and then it works. sometimes."
5,CTA digital Ipod speaker system is great,Great price with good enough sound for use in an office. Love the fact that it charges.
4,Not bad at all,"It's a small speaker system for the Ipod, don't expect a great loud sound, it's good for small rooms or closed areas. If you are with a couple of friends and want to put what I call ""back music"" it's very good because you can talk and laugh with your friends and hear the music in the back. Don't think you can have a party and dance with a great speaker sound and play music loud, it doesn't work that way. Sometimes you push the power button when it's on and doesn't turn off; you have to disconnect physically the plug from the wall. A very good thing as everybody has said before is that while you're playing your music you're charging your Ipod"
2,Not compatible with Nano 3rd gen.,"This is good speaker for the cost, unfortunately it cannot hold the newest Ipod Nano 3rd generation. The audio cable is designed to attach from the top and the new Nano has the audio jack on the bottom. It works, but I have to lay my Nano on top flat instead of standing it in the cradle."
2,This product does not deliver,"This product is unable to charge my Ipod and play something from my Ipod at the same time. Every time I dock my Ipod on this product, my Ipod battery gets fried. I can only play my Ipod with this device, if my Ipod is not docked there. And even with that, sometimes the sound is pretty good. Sometimes it is not. Please know that if you choose to purchase this item because it is cheap, you are doing so at your own risk. After all, you get what you pay for."
5,Awesome for the price and size!,"I'd say this is a ""must-have"" if you have an iPod. I have this at my desk at work and it is small enough to have in a limited space. The volume is VERY adjustable. You can hear it clearly at low volumes, and it sounds okay at higher volumes. My formula:iPod + cubicle/office + love of music = need for this product!"
1,Doesn't work with the newer iPod Nano.,"I was going to give this gift as a present. Decided to test before I gave it. But the adapter that comes with it for the new (remastered) iPod has a spacer at the bottom that doesn't let the connections meet unless you keep you hand pressed down on the iPod. Also there was no sound coming from the right speaker, but that was probably just a specific product defect. I did wind up returning this item."
3,Just ok... but right for the price,"This product was ok. The amount of sound it puts out is quite good, and the iPods dock well with it. I have some problems with the volume buttons-- they don't always respond until you press them quite hard. And I sometimes get weird static sounds when I use my iPod Photo (4G) with it. Overall good though, especially for the low price."
1,Worked for about a month,"I have had this item a little over a month and it no longer puts out sound. The base will charge my ipod but not play the music. It seems hit or miss with this product if you will get a good one or a defective one. But for the money, when it did work, it was perfect for work."
1,Cta Digital IP-RS2 Ipod Round Speaker with Docking,Received the subject item and had to return it. It did not work correctly...speaker problem.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I received speaker and docking station, was'nt overly impressed with the sound quality.I then saw a JBL unit with the same features and very good sound quality,It cost 2 1/2 times that of the CTA unit. I returned the CTA unit to amazon in a quick and easy process. Very pleased with Amazon."
2,Ipod Dock sound sucks,The sound on this is good enough for a small child but any discerning listener would liken it to listening to a radio on a chicken bus in mexico.
1,Not what it said,"This item was advertised as portable, it is not. Don't even try to get satisfaction from company, you will get none."
3,Pack your tunes with you on your next trip,"Fits my Ipod Nano and adapts to other Ipods. Very portable and lightweight. Sound quality is pretty good for what it is. Great for taking on vacation. Can listen to my songs while staying in hotels, etc. Use for charging also. Good purchase!"
3,CTA Digital Ipod Speaker with Docking,"Although the speaker quality is not top of the line, it is more than satisfactory considering the price. Considering the price of this unit, one cannot go wrong. I use the unit mostly to recharge my Ipod after use. I am not sure I can recommend it for those looking for quality listening. All things considered, it is a buy recommendation."
1,never worked,"Dear Sirs: The service you brought me was satisfactory, but the item by himself not. It does not work. The adaptor of 12 v. nerver worked, and using another adaptor (I had to buy it locally) I can only use the speaker with headphones, that is not what I need as you can imagine.Patricia Martin"
1,iPod Dock Disaster,"My husband's Nano doesn't fit ANY of the docks! He can only play it on the base, without putting it in a dock...what's the point?! And this was a Valentine's Day gift."
1,Not all Ipods work with this model,"I bought 2 of these for my boys for Christmas. The write-up says that it works with all Ipods, but this is not true. Both of my boys have the Ipod Touch Generation 2, and Ipod does not support it as an accessory."
2,READ THE FINE PRINT,"Do not be fooled. This product is for an I POD yes, but an I POD Touch WILL NOT set on the speakers like the picture shows. You have to hook it up with a cord. It does work yes, but I wanted it to set neatly on my office desk like the picture shows and it does not do that. You have a cord that attaches to the touch and you have to lay it on the desk also."
2,Wasn't what i thought,"I bought this because it looked compact and the best i could find, that i could afford at the time, and it stated that it supported 4th Generation I pod Nano.As soon as i connected it, my screen lite up and said will not support this device. I was disappointed. The sound was decent, u just have to adjust your sound settings on your I pod settings so u don't get too much static.Sorry wasn't to happy with it."
5,Great product,Thanks for the quick delivery. Everything is in good shape and it plays just fine. Thanks!
2,Be Wareabout the static,"I bought this speaker mainly becasue of the price and the ratings given by other people on AMazon.I must say I am very disappointed in this product. First of all, it makes a static sound just before the song starts. Almost always on the first song. Afterwards, the static may come back randomly. Second, The speakers can not re-produce all the notes of the music. May be that is expected for this price.I will give it another 1-2 day and if the static keeps coming, I will return this unit. I think this is probably made by some chineese companies who stole the product design from the west and trying to make a quick buck by dumping it at such a low price. It is working as this is top 100 product at Amazon."
2,cheap but poor quality,"I bought this ipod round speaker a while ago. It is cheap but the sound quality is really poor, and so I have to return it."
2,Poor Sound but its cheap,Very poor quality but what do you expect for a cheap item like this? Spend the extra money for a good one.
2,small price to pay for big problems,"pros: cheap..but also literally, adaptable (in a sense), whitecons: iPod adapter would not fit the 5th gen iPod nano, iPod connector as well as the audio cable were shorted resulting in mono output, cheapI doubt this was caused by Amazon or a botchy shipment. I must keep forgetting why I don't buy cheap products.. Save the extra money and spend it on something reliable. Why chance buying something cheap, finding out it's junk, then waiting for the return process?"
4,Cta Digital IP-RS2 Ipod Round Speaker with Docking,"Works and sounds great. If it was portable, ran on batteries, it would be wonderful."
2,Whimpy sound,This is not portable and needs to be plugged in to work. Sound is about what one could expect for the price. There are no controls other than volume. It would be nice to be able to skip to the next song without touching the iPod.
3,Decent for office environment,"I bought this item originally to use in the office and it worked very well there. However, if used at home, the clarity with the volume turned up isn't amazing. However, in general I was pleased with the purchsae for the price and the delivery. Decent product!"
1,Disappointment,"My daughter wanted simple speakers for her Ipod, and I was hoping not to spend too much money. However, when she plugged the whole thing in on Christmas afternoon, the sound was so distorted that she started to cry. Obviously, not a viable option for a teenager!"
2,Mixed feelings- Limited Application,"I purchased two of these speakers not expecting much in the price range. Therefore, I did not have the expanded expectations of other reviewers (I already own the Bose system). I only needed the speaker for the following two applications in a child's room:1) Light playing of children's music2) Playing bedtime storiesSuffice it to say, the device barely meets my limited applications. Sound range is VERY limited when playing music. However, for children's stories or podcasts, the range is acceptable and volume seems sufficient. For traveling with children, the device is compact, making portability fantastic.One key gripe I do have is that the fit to older Ipods (first gen) is not really good.The speaker seems better suited for podcasts than music. If you are looking for good sound, you will not find it at this price range."
3,Depends on what you're looking for.......,"I purchased this product to be able to play my ipod at work and other places like hotels. It's good for those reasons. The sound is not very good. The inserts do not work. When I try to put my ipod nano in the proper insert it doesn't connect, but when I take the insert out, it works just fine. If you're looking for something that sounds great, this is not the right purchase for you, but the price kind of makes up for the rest."
4,Good buy,"I ordered this speaker dock for my husband for Christmas. It was one of least expensive ones I saw and it got really good reviews. The only complaint that I have about it is the the adaptor that came with it for the new iPod Nano does not seem to work. You cannot press the iPod in far enough for it to make a connection with the speaker. To solve this problem, I just don't use an adaptor at all - I plug the iPod directly onto the speaker. This works fine when the speaker is placed on a flat surface where it is not going to be disturbed. I wouldn't recommend doing this if it is in a place where it will be bumped into as the iPod could fall off or be damaged."
1,Won't last long,"I bought this and within 3 months with little use it died on me. I mainly used it to charge my iPod while away from my PC and would also play my iPod with it. The sound is tinny, very cheap. That I could live with as long as it still charged my iPod I was somewhat happy. But as I said within 3 months it stopped working completely. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't charge, wouldn't do anything at all. I tried multiple outlets and cables but nothing worked. So, even though this isn't expensive, save your money and buy something that has more longevity and better design quality."
2,iPod speaker with docking station by CTA,"I purchased 2 of these sound stage docking stations, which are marketed specifically for use with the iPod. Neither one worked properly. The iPods did not play through the station's speakers when docked - they had to be connected to the station with a cable for the music to play. Also, this docking station would not charge the iPods (one of the primary product features). A message displayed on the iPod screens stating that the devices were not compatible. This product was a total waste of money."
2,Not as promised,"""...even has a built in charger that recharges your iPod either while idle or in use.""That's not true. This will not charge ipod 2nd generation. That was the main reason the product was purchased. It does, however, play the music when the cord is used. It does not play the music when ipod is docked."
1,Charging does not work.,"You get what you pay for, it seems like it is very similar to more expensive models, bu then will not charge. Sounds fine, but was purchased to charge also. Still working on a return but am not sure I want to deal with the time and effort to do it."
2,iPod Sound Dock,I returned this item as the speaker only worked on one side. The speaker that did work was tinny with little sound clarity.
1,Not what I expected,Although the product advertises it is for 5th generation it did not recognize my IPod. It couldn't hook up with my 5th generation docking adaptor and when I hooked up without it the message kept saying that this product does not have charging capabilities. I sent it back after talking to customer service.
2,"It's cheap, but no value","It won't charge with new Nanos (2010 models). It will play, but the first thing that comes up on the Nano's screen is an alert telling you it's not compatible with the charger. I bought two of these docks and two nanos and none of them work together, so it's no fluke. Aside from that, the base adapters don't fit the new models either, and even if you have an adapter that came with the iPod, it still won't fit, because the placement of the interface is about 1/16 of an inch off. And the sounds is like an AM transistor radio."
1,Does not charge as advertised,I am currently deployed and wanted something small to play in my office. I needed something that would both play and charge my IPOD. When I turn on the device my IPOD gives a message stating that it does not support this accessory and it will not charge my IPOD Nano 4th generation 8GB. Even though it advertises that it does charge it does not. I called the store and the representative was courteous and helpful. He even sent out a new device but it still did not charge. I have to return it for a refund.
2,Not so great,"Mine seems to have a short in it so I have to push the button a bunch of times to get it to come on. When it comes on there is a huge amount of static for the first few seconds. The volume is really not too responsive. The ipod wont sit on the dock very well without the adapter put in behind it. The adapter cannot stay in there, b/c then I cannot get the ipod back on there so I have to take it off and put it on each time, sort of a pain."
4,Ipod Speakers,"I like my speakers. It is the perfect size for my desk and I feel like it is a good quality product especially for the price. I wish the on/off button was in the front next to the volume buttons. Because the button is in the back, and there is no power light, I sometimes forget to turn it off. However, I do recieve a nice clear, sharp sound and the volume goes pretty loud so I could use it outside of the as well. This would be a nice gift for someone."
1,Tinny cheap sound,"Save your money for better quality speakers, there is a noticeable difference in sound quality between the Ipod headphones and these speakers."
1,AWFUL,"I bought this item, used it once with the docking connection and it was working ok, but when I wanted to turn it on the next day it didn't WORK! no sound! I had it replaced but again THE SAME THING HAPENNED! I can't still believe it! I'm very dissapointed, it's been the worst experience I've ever had with Amazon.. Don't BUY THIS! As someone said on another review... this item is cheeply made, so don't waste your money and buy something more expensive with higher quality."
4,does the job,I just wanted a small station I could use in the kitchen while cooking and this does the job!
1,Not for new iPods,Who knows if it works or not... Unless your iPod is older the CTA Digital IP-RS2 won't interface. Certainly doesn't work with the new Nanos with the audio jack in the bottom.
2,This is being returned!,"I have a new IPOD Nano and the adaptor will not let it make a complete connection. The only way it works is to remove the adaptor, but then it's loosly sitting there and will eventually break the Nano. Beware if you have a new Nano."
2,disappointing content,Let the buyer beware!This is NOT an instuctional resource for dancing with double veil. This video features a lengthy warm up...a scant few well-known SINGLE veil movements and only two double veil figures (also well known and VERY general)I had hoped for more from this popular and accomplished teacher/dancer. I wish these production companies and their artists would be honest. This video would be more accurately titled...The Beginner's brief and very limited Introduction to Dance with Veil.
2,Disappointing,"If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD."
4,Good introduction to the double veil,"This is a good DVD for beginners, at a very reasonable price. 10 moves are demonstrated with clear explainations. Of course the double veil usually requires spinning, which does not make it easy for beginning dancers, but with some practice interesting moves can be achieved holding them together in both hands or one in each hand.At the end there is a performance to illustrate the moves and the concepts demonstrated in the DVD. Also includes a warm-up and a cool down."
4,Barbie Bonanza,"I think that this computer game is a wonderful toy. I think that I would even enjoy it. I think that it is a great toy for younger kids and even older kids and preteens to have. It is for imaginative and creative minds, and you can let the kids have control of something for once. This is a great toy and I recommend anyone who has a young girl to get this for them. They will truely love it!"
4,Barbie Mania,"This is an ideal software for any Barbie lover. Create your own world with many design tools. Everything is at your fingertips.First you start off with choosing from doing Barbie or one of her other friends. Then you choose what background you want, from a stage to a pj party. All the choices in this game keep you busy.I have had this game since i was 7 and i still enjoy it now.i definatly recommend buying this for you child, friend, or yourself. I garentee you won't regret it."
4,My Daughters Love It,"My daughters really enjoy playing this game, it's like virtual dress-up. It also has some nice, soft-pop/R&B music that plays in the background, with some uplifting themes for girls."
2,"Love the songs, hate the static!",My husband and I are very disappointed in this CD. It sounds like it was recorded from someone's old scratched LP. My old CSN LPs sound better than this.
1,Wouldn't play,"This CD would not play. I tried several different CD players, including my computer, and all the songs skip. Maybe it's pirated???? Don't waste your money - go to a music store."
2,Okay-Not The Best Of CSN,Don't know if I would purchase again as I was expecting more out of it but as a whole this music does send a very strong message about the United States.
2,like boring,"although i thought i was a fan of this group, and i do like their work, i have to say that this album is poorly edited. you must admit that all their hits have a simalar sound what with the accoustic guitars and the effete voices and sound. each song is sung with the same or similar tempo. after a while they sound the same and got on my nerves. it is unlistenable in a single playing"
2,CSN Hits,I didn't like this as much as CSN & Y CD I bought. Some of the different songs on the CD just weren't to my liking.
2,"this CD was just ""OK""",The majority of the songs were not their greatest hits and I was disappointed in the song selection on this CD.
1,Not In THIS House,"How utterly ODD, I've never received this purchase and they are asking me to review it? I'm only left wondering what I paid to have this privilege? ? ?I'd love to have it, the group is one of my all-time favorites"
3,music4ever,"How can this be a greatest hits album without all time favorites such as Deja Vu and Woodstock. Including these songs would of truly made this a greatest hits album. Hate these marketing people, always short changing the consumer [imports seem to do a much better Job] to bad this is not the case.. Buy Deja VU with this album and you got the package this albun should of been..."
4,"The Best of CSN, not their Greatest Hits","I consider myself a dedicated fan, having every CSN album, save one and having seen them in concert twice. I don't mean to be critical of a great group, but I would have like to see a compilation of their singles in chronological order. A number of cuts on this album were never released as singles, nor were they ""hits"" in any meaningful sense of that word. So the title is misleading. It seems this is Graham Nash's compilation from what the liner notes tell us. Apparently, Neil Young is not viewed as a member of the group, (this is a CSN album) and his material, most notably ""Ohio"" is omitted, while various other tracks, were included. The liner notes remind us of how much CSN owes to Steve Stills' musical leadership. I'm personally offended by Nash's ""Cathedral"" and the album cover artwork isn't appealing, but, overall, the music is great, the harmonies soar and the musicianship is first rate."
4,best compilation of greatest hits,"One of the best compilation of greatest hits collections the hits and signature songs of Crosby, Stills & Nash. Southern Cross, Marrakesh Express and Long Time Gone. Just to name a few. you will not be disappointed."
5,"The Classic Collection of ""CSN""!","This remastered collection of ""CSN""*Greatest Hits truly pays tribute to a band that will last forever. Nineteen classics grace this album and the re-mastering is amazing. Every song sounds fresh, from the seven-and-a-half minute, ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"" to the anthemic, ""Carry On/Questions"". Of course, the clever ditties of ""Our House"" and ""In My Dreams"" are not forgotten and memories flow back with, ""Marrakesh Express"" and ""Teach Your Children"". The booklet is full of colorful collages and there is a complete rundown of each songs writer, vocalists and band player. There are an amazing number of famous studio musicians listed as well. Event the dates of each songs recording are included. The only real surprise is the tribute to `Mama' Cass Elliot, ""without whom most of this music may never have been made"". Good job to Graham Nash and Joel Bernstein for compiling this masterpiece."
4,CSN Greatest Hits,"I bought the CD for the song ""Southern Cross"" but I liked all the songs especially ""Delta"". Listening to it brought back a lot of memories."
4,Almost perfect,"Because this CD is titled Crosby, Stills & Nash, I did not expect, nor did I mind that no songs featuring Neil Young were on it (hey, that's what HIS greatest hits CD is for).What I did mind was that two quintesential hit songs, ""Deja Vu"" and ""Woodstock"" were omitted.As far as I'm concerned, this is the second time C,S&N; stiffs me. The first was when I saw them live in 1990. Would you believe they did NOT perform ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes""? What exactly were they smoking that night???"
4,Officer Friendly,Great album...after remastering it sounded as fresh as any new on the shelf album....I was surprised at the quality of sound and the material. If you like CSN this album would be enough.
5,A Flood of Memories,"Crosby, Stills, and Nash have long been a favorite of mine, songs stored in the recesses of my mind. This CD took me back to a time that was more carefree and innocent, where song lyrics nearly always had a message, or told a story, and musicians seemed more like next door neighbors than far away icons. I have enjoyed it many times already, and would highly recommend it! Awesome CSN legacy collection!"
4,I really like this one,"I must say that I am not an avid CSN fan. However, this is a very good compilation. I like every song on it and listen to this often. There are maybe a few additional songs that I would have liked to have on this CD, including some live stuff. However, this is really good."
5,Baby Boomer likes it!,This is a wonderful CD. Brought me back to my youth and the fantastic sounds of Crosby Stills & Nash. Wow!
4,This Was Bound to Happen,"Darn near everbody releases a G/H package eventually, so it's hard to criticize these guys for it. The fact is though for the limited amount of product CSN has put out there over so many years, most fans and even so-so fans probably have most of CSN's stuff in their collections. But judging it ""for what it's worth"", this is a pretty good song set. It's kinda nice to see some of Crosby's tunes on here. as he seems to get kicked to the curb sometimes. Personally, I wound have traded off 49 bye-Byes for Deja Vu, if for no other reason but to even it up even more. And it would have been nice to get the live version of Long Time Gone from the Four Way Street album, which really rocks and comes across more passionate than the rather tame studio version. But, just my wishful thinking..."
5,Maynard's Australian Match,"Fantastic player(in Maynard Fergusen style),who plays all the trumpet,trombone,& sax parts.Fantastic trombone playing (in the style of Bill Watrous).Can't believe how talented he is."
4,nice shoes,"nice shoes overall, but I can't say they're soft. Back side rubs the back of my ankles, needs a lot of walking to soften them I guess. Nice design, good looking, steady and wide enough."
1,Just not fresh,"This gum is great in the individual packs, but in the bulk 300-piece, all of the pieces are stale -- hard to chew and lacking in flavor."
1,Seriously?,I cannot believe that this mobile is listed at over $2000!! My 5 year old daughter could probably do a better job shaping and creating the characters and would still end up only costing me $25. What a rip off!
4,My Toddler loves it,We recently bought this mattress a little over 2 weeks and it's great for the toddler bed. It said that with time and movement from baby the corner edges will spread to fit the bed frame better. It fits fine right now. I would not buy this mattress for a baby because I think it is too soft but for my toddler who loves to sleep our soft bed and loves pillows this is perfect.
2,Doesn't fit my crib.,"I read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room. I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn't buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby (160.00) which I did for my first baby and it was great. It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit. I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel. This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price. I bought it yesterday and took it back today. I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use."
3,Good for one only,We spent the extra to get the lifetime warranty on the best mattress for our child. But it tore fairly quickly. It did not even last through our first. Couldn't possibly use it for our second. I am having a hard time finding out how to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. We'll have to see how it goes if I can find it and how quickly we can get a replacement.
2,bad fit,I was really excited to get this mattress after much research of online reviews and visits to babies r us stores. However I got home only to find that the mattress does not fit my crib. I was able to slide it back and forth (side to side). My hole hand and wrist almost fit between the two. I read the dimemsions on the tag and it's supposed to be the same as the mattress I previously purchaced for my 18 month old when he was born but it can't be. I even tested the crib by putting my sons Sealy Crown Jewel mattress in there and that one fit fine.The matress has good features just a BAD FIT. I will be returning it today and back to the drawing board.I wish babies r us still sold the Crown Jewel by Sealy!
2,tore after only 3 years!!,"I bought this mattress 3 years ago for my first child and it already tearing on the ""tear resistant"" cover material. All she does is sleep on it!"
5,Great Printer,"This was my first laser printer and I love it. The set-up was easy and fast, the print quality is good, and the speed is excellent. I was concerned about only printing in B&W, so I left my ink-jet connected as well. I was surprised with how few documents I printed that needed color. I hardly ever use my ink-jet now, as I can't stand to wait on it. The cartridges are on the expensive side, but it was over a year with moderate printing until I had to replace it. A tip: when the print quality starts getting light, take out the cartridge, turn it back and forth a few times and re-insert. You may have to do this a few times, but you can get a month or more of good pages out of it before replacing."
2,Robbins clone,"I am on page 140 now, and will update later, but so far Brezny is just a Tom Robbins wannabe. This is amateur bs. ""Her pocket graced her shirt."" That says it-graced? He has long lists of nonsense terms that are clearly imitating Robbins, and by the way, I saw his website and he used Robbins on there, so he obviously is obsessed with him. The book is flawed from the beginning-he launches into a internal monologue which is several pages long that we're supposed to believe that the main character has in less than a second. Does anyone else find that seriously flawed?"
1,Terrible Tome,There are novels that are so bad they don't require a long review. This is such a thing. It received a star from me because there is no way I could give it a black hole. Do not waste your money. I have already pissed-away my time on this terrible exercise.
5,a spectacular work of symbolic genecide & fermented magic,If you are a devote beauty and truth fan this is a must have. Even if you are just a fan of meaningless poetic perfection dont miss this prophetic encounter with the third kind. This hip-clever-new-age-for-the-masses tale will take your mind and set it free of expectaions and a need to ask why. Be sure to leave all your beliefs behind and become coverted to the sexually righteous stage of the televisionary oracle.
1,"disappointed -- writing style is too far ""out there"" for me","Don't get me wrong. I'm not new to New Age writings -- quite the opposite in fact, which is why I was so pleasantly intrigued with the premise of this book. With the author's writing style, though, I couldn't go more than a few chapters in before I realized I was growing increasingly skeptical and annoyed. Frankly, the writings read (to me) like someone who was extremely high when they were written or, less charitably, by someone who was mocking his readers.I choose to believe the author's intentions were good, and will only say that my approach to the subject matter is apparently considerably more pragmatic than the author's, um, esoteric approach.You'll find this same review by me on the same author's ""Pronoia"". That's not an accident -- his writing style completely puts me off."
4,Great watch,I've had this watch for 7 years. The only thing I don't like is the band because they keep breaking after about a year.
2,False advertising,"The Casio website states that this watch is waterproof to 30M, but after I received it I discovered that it is not waterproof. I therefore returned it."
1,Built-In Obsolescence,"No one who sells this watch services it, for good reason: replacing the battery in Casio calculator/database watches destroys them. Wal-Mart got wise to this and displays a sign stating that they don't service Casio watches. After my third Casio purchase, I got wise to this too. I'll purchase a Timex calculator watch next time, but I prefer the look and style of Casio."
3,Password protection,"I own casio databannk since 1990 dbm 150, i buy on may 2008 a DBC 150 because i read on descrption that this watch have a""password protection"" that is false!, this watch do not have password protection, you cant store names and phones under password, all phones number and names that you store are visible to everyone.the only thing is memory erase protection when you change the battery.but dont buy this watch if you expect password protection.i write to customer service but they doesnt understand what is password protection ans say to me go to casi direct to solve the problem.the problem is i buy because i read password protecction but that is not true.just read isnt enough, ask others and read reviwes before buy"
4,Good watch,Good watch. Light is very nice. Buttons are smaller and harder to push than the cheaper models.
5,Return of an old friend,"This watch replaces the same model I've had for 15 years that finally wore out this summer. When so many electronic items are declared obsolete after a few years and are no longer available, it was great to see the Data Bank 150 is alive and well. Thanks to Casio and Amazon! I use the phone # and world time features quite regularly."
4,Calc.watch,"I've owned 4 of these watches over 20 years. It is a great data storage watch. I couldn't be without it. I always put my watch on, but I don't always have my cell phone. Too bad they don't make them anymore. Only draw backs are the small key buttons and that after a 3-4 years the button printing starts to wear off from pressing the buttons. I once had the metallic silver version of this model which I would buy if they were still around."
2,Falling Apart,"I purchased this watch directly from Amazon on August 26, 2009. I never used the memory but the other functions worked ok.My problem is that within the past few weeks the case which is made of some sort of black composite plastic material has literally begun breaking apart at stress points. First, at two points on the back where the small screws hold the stainless steel back to the case, the case material chipped off making it impossible to screw in two of the four the screws. Today, the wrist strap became unattached. Trying to reattach the strap, I saw that the case had broken at one of the small holes for holding the pins that attach watch bands to a watch. So now it is impossible to fasten the watch band to the watch.Maybe it was just a bad batch of plastic used for the case. I have had Casio watches that lasted for years. But one would think that something like that would be caught by the quality control people."
5,Great watch! Excellent price and service.,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GB1R8C/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleMy dad, who is in his 80s and is disabled, has worn a Casio Databank Watch for years. He loves all the features. I was able to find this for him as a replacement for the last one and he is absolutely thrilled with it.While most young people these days carry cell phones loaded with information, many older people do not. This is a great way for them to have easy access to stored numbers and data.Thanks once again, Amazon, for your great value and service."
4,Practical,"Had the metallic version for many years before the case broke irretrievably. It proved very practical, beyond just telling the time. Difficult to now get that version at a reasonable price - and the case/strap tends to fray cuffs.The resin version is a bit less elegant ............."
3,Good price,"I have owned this model for several years and am on my 3rd watch. I especially use the calendar scheduling mode to help me remember meetings. The other watches quit after 3 or 4 years. I had given up purchasing the same model because of the price increase. Since I wanted the scheduling mode, I was not interested in any of the models. This model was no longer available at the local department stores and the price at Casio on line was more than I was willing to pay. When I found it on Amazon, it was within my price range. I do find that the numbers and letters begin to wear off after a while, but not enough to make it impossible to read."
2,DB150 was much better,I tried this watch as an alternative to the DB150's that I have used for years. I wanted the large database for phone numbers and thought the DBC150 would meet my needs although I didn't want the calculator. It didn't meet my needs because the display was too small which made the numbers very hard to read. I returned this and tried the EDB610 which has a goofy blue display that makes the info hard to read. I returned that and dropped back to the DB-36 which has less storage but at least I can read the data.DB-150 had a great display and was easy to read. Bummer that they've been discontinued.
3,CASIO DATABANK,"Overall lots of features but the alarm chime, hourly chime is very weak. Hard to hear."
4,Casio DB 150,I've owned 2 of these and tried other watches... none have the same features for the money. It's easy to learn to use also.
1,Looks good but...,The battery wears out easily because all it accepts is small batteries. So it is a waste of money. I wish I could return it but it is too late!!
4,does the trick,"This is a very unique toy. The shape is well thought out and comfortable to use. I would have preferred variable speeds and more powerful vibrations; but this toy is sure to please. It is also fun with a partner, and easy (and non-threatening) to introduce to first-timers."
2,Looks great!,"I saw a picture of this thing and I started envisioning all the great climaxes we would reach together.I was disappointed to say the least.It doesn't fit me right. If the G is touched (not vibrated because the micro-mini silver isn't that powerful) then the C is not. If the C is getting the full effect from the vibrating mini, then the G is ignored.There were no directions, so maybe I am just doing it wrong...but how is that possible? I know where everything is on my own body!One review said it makes a great dog chew toy, and I would give it to my dog if I thought no one would know what it really was meant for."
5,Ammmmmmazing,"I really don't understand the negative reviews for this product. At first I was wondering if if would be good for me. I've never really tried the g-spot thing. But it worked like a charm. I insert it, lay on my back with a pillow between my legs and my hand applying pressure... works every time. Love this thing. And I didn't have any issues with the bullet not sending vibes through the whole thing. Anyways, I recommend this product to people who are used to penetration. If you're not, this will probably hurt."
2,tease & denial toy,"If you're a girl that is into tease & denial, this the toy for you! You feel some stimulation, and it makes you try harder hoping to reach relief... but as hard as you try, you won't reach orgasm with no other stimulation. It's erotic torture, it's tantalism! So it could serve someone, somewhere... but not me. Waste of money...Also, is there an easy way to get the battery out???"
3,I just don't get it,"I've heard wonderful things about this particular toy, and I know that there are alot of fans for it. But I have to say, it doesn't work for everyone. If you've had trouble with your g-spot in the past, this toy probably isn't going to be much fun for you. It's very well made, though."
1,"It was not ""rockin,"" as they say",Cell phone vibration level rivals this contraptionOne size does not fit allbutton switch on bullet broke on tryoutgreat dog chew toyThis thing made me so angry I threw it out in the yard.
2,It was an OK book,"This book was well written, butt needed a little more to the plot of the story, it is worth reading and will keep you happy."
3,"A Good Marilyn Manson Book,However Tends to Drag","When Kurt Reighley wrote this book I don't think he actually realized that fans of Marilyn Manson were gonna wanna read this due to the fact it's about Marilyn Manson.However the book will talk about Manson and then it will just all of a suden turn into a serial killer bio,with three pages about Charles Manson,and also small bios on Albert Fish,Henry Lee Lucas,Ed Gein,John Wayne Gacy,and David Berkowitz.This book is supposed to be about Marilyn Manson and the band,not the serial killers that inspired the band to change their names.Now i'll read anything that has to do with Marilyn Manson if I can get my hands on it and I don't care if it is terrible I will read it cover to cover,but this book is not for a person who wants to know about MM.Not to mention this book sounds almost like it was written by ex-Manson guitarist Daisy Berkowitz.Read this if you're obscessed with Marilyn Manson,but if you want the facts straight,read his autobiography."
5,the truest manson fan ever!!!,The best book I have ever read in my life. I don't understand how a person could go through all that and still go on with his life... I always tell people that diss manson to at least read his book once. and than tell me what they think... I love this man and his book!!!!The long hard road out of hell.-Sher
3,Co-wrote by daisy after he quit the band is not a good idea,this book kind of trashed on manosn (the man not the band) a bit because of the fact that it was cowrote by daisy berkowitz a ex member of manson but after first couple of chapters he stops bitching and starts writing and it is pretty good because it tells some stuff not in the auto-biography
3,aab7a,"This book has facts, but it isn't what I expected at all. I was kind of disappointed; I wanted to know more about the band and their lives, this book just tells more about when the music was produced and what the songs meant. It's an okay read, but not what I wanted."
5,MANSON,"THIS BOOK TALKS ABOUT HIS SONGS,AND WHAT THEY MEAN.IT TALKS ABOUT EACH ALBUM.IT TALKS ABOUT HIS CONCERTS,AND WHAT GOES ON BEFORE,AND AFTER THE CONCERTS.THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING,AND INFORMATIVE BOOK."
5,This book is alright but Long Hard Road is better.,Marilyn Manson fans should buy this book as well as the other book but my opinion is that this book tells more about the band and thats good but Long Hard Road tells more about him.
4,good overview,"This book gives a good overview about the origins, theory and practices of magical realism, and also posits this category among the principal literary and cultural practices of postmodernism. The only thing I did not like was the ending, in which the author over criticises the term more than suggesting further possibilities, practises and applications of magical realism, although the final chapter is named ""The future of Magic(al) Realism"".Another thing is that most of its content and reflexions can be found in Zamora's and Farris' books, but it is a good starting point for those who are not literary critics or specialists in this subject."
3,cowboy fest!,these are older westerns but are still very cool to watch. many in the vein of Clint Eastwoods westerns. i enjoyed quite a few of these 20 movies. the picture quality is good and theres lots of action. i recommend.
2,Not the best manual by any stretch,"I have several Haynes manuals and overall they are so-so at best but this one is really lacking. They claim it's based on a complete tear down but apparently their car didn't have pistons, rods, or a crankshaft because there is no mention of those other than bore and stroke and rod bolt and main cap torque. No info on journal sizes and tolerances, piston and bore tolerances, ring end gaps or groove tolerances or anything else a person might want to know when working on those parts of their engine.I think I've finally learned my lesson and will just stick to Chilton from now on, even if I have to order them online and wait a week..."
3,"Light, straightforward Lafferty","Why read straightforward Lafferty to begin with? Well, this one contains a couple of laughs and is pleasant to read.It could be better though. The plot is so slow going it might as well not be there. The kids who were supposed to kill everyone in the world mostly spend their time hiding from the world, and their father/uncle waits patiently for his execution until the last couple of chapters.Things happen but not much goes on, so to speak.It's pleasant to read, but I can only recommend it after you have read Fourth Mansions, Past Master, Not to Mention Camels, The Flame is Green, Arrive at Easterwine, Space Chantey, Archipelago, and The Devil is Dead, in that order, and some of his short stories from Nine Hundred Grandmothers."
4,"Very Nice, but does not work with PRISIM","If you have a Handspring Visior Prisim, note that this does not work, as it requires the battery cover on the back of the unit!"
1,"Caused a short and Fire (!) in my Visor, and lousy service","Thought the product would be a great way to save the environment, by using a rechargeable battery rather than continually running through batteries. One day, at work, I smelled an odor like matches and heard a popcorn crackling sound from my Visor. I immediately popped open the battery compartment and threw the batteries to the ground. The plastic around one of the terminal leads was melted and one battery was too hot to hold. On contacting ICU about a refund (since I didn't trust the unit anymore), they were neither helpful or apologetic in their emails. Simply, suggesting I contact a distributor about a refund. If they had even bothered to offer some assistance and troubleshooting, I wouldn't be writing this review."
1,Dangerous product,"I purchased this product with idea of saving time, and money on batteries. The first time that I used it, it caused me to lose all the data on my Visor. Fearful that Visor would invalidate my warrenty, I did not tell Visor what happened and they got me going again. When I asked them about this product ""in passing"" they told ME that it would cause me to lose all my date. Thank goodness I Hot Sync'ed before trying it. I returned it immediately."
4,bread and tulips,I had seen this movie previously and i always wanted to own it. it hasn't disappointed. It brings you into the basics of human life in the setting of Italy and let's you see what is really important.
3,Shirley Valentine Ripoff,"See the movie ""Shirley Valentine"" instead. ""Shirley Valentine"" is to ""Bread and Tulips"" what ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" was to ""Tortilla Soup."" It steals the idea from that movie, but doesn't do it justice.It's slightly different, but you can tell where it came from, and if you like the plot, see the real thing. Cause Shirley Valentine is really funny."
4,An enjoyable and touching movie.,"I'm glad I had an opportunity to see this movie. I found it very enjoyable, and also quite touching in many scenes. It is a very pleasant and refreshing alternative to the typical and formulaic movies coming out of Hollywood these days. There are no deafening crashes or explosions. There are few bombastic momements of ""high drama."" What you end up with is a very nice and touching story about some special human beings you enjoy getting to know."
4,Great Movie,"This is a great movie, and unfortantly being a foreign language film its not easy to find. I searched high and low to find this film to buy it for my mothers birthday. This is the only place I found."
4,A feel-good film,"Great acting. Beautiful scenery. A lovely script. Non-box office hit, but who needs those? This one is about reality and fantasy. Nicely done. Would watch again."
4,Italian Romance,With subtitles - a fun comedy about a woman who sets out to find herself with out really knowing it when her husband leaves her at a highway rest stop.
5,Light hearted Movie,"A nice little romantic movie. The acting was good, you really cared what happened to his woman.It had a good storyline AND I got to see wonderful scenes of Venice.Very enjoyable."
5,Excellent movie,It does have subtitles but it is a very funny poignant love story. It arrived in excellent condition and worked perfectly.
4,bread and tulips,"naturally, understanding italian makes this film all the more enjoyable. Nonetheless, the flavor of the film comes through even with subtitles. The characters are endearing, believable,(perhaps a bit caracaturish), and the pace is soothing. some nice shots of venice, and to boot, a happy ending."
3,Made Me Drowsy,"Licia Maglietta plays the Italian every-woman in this 2000 comedy. She is literally left behind at a bus station by her family while she tries to fish out her wedding ring at the bottom of a toilet, which is essentially her marriage to an over excitable toilet-fixture businessman with a buxom mistress. So, what does our left behind spouse do; she hitchhikes to Venice and arranges to miss her bus home repeatedly as she finds work and a new life in a beautiful canalled city. Enter Bruno Ganz, a suicidal waiter that falls for her immediately. She plays the accordion; he sings. You get the idea, quirky.The film develops very slowly and the laughs are here and there. Licia is nice and we want her to find happiness, but I must say there is a TV sitcom feel to the film, which probably didn't bother the Europeans, but here in America, awash with nightly sitcoms, I felt a little drowsy through Bread and Tulips."
3,3&half for me,this was a cool lite film that dealt with some interesting subject matter about Happiness&Love.I've seen other films in the same vein so I wasn't blown away.but it works.it has a nice charm to it.
3,a social critique on Itailan machismo- but not too many laug,"At first the movie got off to a slow start, but then once new characters became invovled in the plot, things started to change for the protagonist.The movie is a cross between Desparately Seeking Susan with Madonna and Just Married...At parts you will be waiting for the ending to come, which you know what it is.This movie examines Italian machismo and makes an interesting statement by staying that Fernando is the man for her. Fernando, is not like her husband or sons, because he was changed by his experience in jail. Hmm, is this a commentary saying that men will only be decent to women once they are punished for their behavoir?? Maybe I'm pulling too much out of this one!It's nto as funny for the American audience, I did not find more than maybe one moment as funny. The movie has some odd parts and it is incredible to think how Fernando would let her stay with him so long...It's worth seeing, but maybe just once."
1,bread and tulips,The film is supposed to have subtitles. Well there are a few so far spaced out that it is ridiculous and when they do appear they often do not make sense. Very disapointed as we were not able to follow the film very well at all.
3,Not His Best,"In this release, Foster seems to launch into what has actually proved to be a successful career as a pop producer. But not here.These songs are mostly weak hooks with glossy production, save for the incredible ""Freedom"", which makes its debut on this collection.Like most artists, Foster is at his best when he is behind the keyboards himself, doing his own stuff.Check out ""David Foster"", ""Rechordings"", and ""The Symphony Sessions"" instead."
5,This is the album you want to buy over and over again...,"""River of love"" contains some of the westcoast genre's best vocalsts, such as Warren Wiebe and Jeff Pescetto. If you've heard the name (david foster) and wants to check out some of his glorious work. Buy 3 copies of this ! One for yourself, one you keep for when the first one is weared out and one for the person you share this kind of music-interest with ! If I was stranded on an island with only 10 albums to bring with me, this would be one of them. Also check out the band/album: Airplay. Simply pure fun and great musicians."
4,Soulful songwriting & awesome melodies,Marc Broussard's voice reminds of a cross between Gavin Degraw and Andy Grammar - the lyrics as well. There's much originality to be found in the lyrics and the style of singing is soulful. About 90% of this album was a win for me - I love songs that make me want to linger and these truly do.
5,Take me HOME!!,"The song ""Home"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard. I drove 1200 miles straight listening to this album over and over for the end stretch, cranking the speakers and singing along to stay awake. You can't fall asleep with Mark Broussard singing- he's pure energy."
3,First song is great...,"I don't know what to think of this album. I've listened to it many times and the first song ""Home"" has been heavily played on the local AA stations in Baltimore--this song got me hooked on the album. Imagine my surprise when I heard the rest of it though....expecting to hear the same amazing style of bluesy soul, I was disappointed to find that most of the songs took me back to the Billy Ocean era of the 80's. I didn't think the rest of the album really ""fit"" with ""Home"", unless maybe you count ""Lonely Night in Georgia.""I'll probably end up selling this one after a while."
2,not too impressed,i got this album because i was in love with the texture of his voice and really liked the song that came on VH1 every day for a month or so.some of the songs are kind of pop-ish and his voice deserved much better than that.hes incredibly soulful and may still make a wonderful album. this one just wasnt it for me.
5,My Favorite CD,I saw Marc fortunately when I went to see Bonnie Raitt in Atlanta for the first time a few months ago. I loved his show and ordered this CD and listen to it almost daily on my commute! I LOVE THIS CD! His songs will touch your soul!!! You will not be disappointed in this purchase!
5,It's all about Marc!,"As a HUGE fan of Marc's, I would have to say that although I rank him as my favorite singer of all times, I have to say this CD is not as great as it should be! Don't get me wrong, it's still one of the best I've ever bought, I'm more excited to see what his follow ups will be! I've been very fortunate to see this cajun-soul singer live twice and it's a life altering experience. These songs are exactly what I'd expect from his debut, however, if the first CD is this great, the second is bound to be a chart topper! I'm torn between yelling from the rooftops his praises and being very quiet, because he's so good, I'd like to keep him all to myself!"
2,Great on NPR...What happend to the CD?,I heard Marc sing live acoustic on NPR (national public radio). He was amazing!! I was blown away. I think this record fails because it is over produced and without complimentary direction. They went pop when clearly Marc's ace in the hole is rootsy. Marc is a great tallent but this is far from a great record.I hope the record company will stick with him long enough to mature. He could make a great record with the right team!!
5,Play it over and over and over and over!!!!!!!,"Are you tired of buying a CD and only getting maybe a few songs (if you're lucky) to play more than once? Then get Carencro because this is something that is a diamond in the rough! Something you can play without hitting the forward button time and time again. Put it on...let it play...you won't be disappointed. Give every song a chance and listen to the lyrics and the dynamics of the song in it's whole. I've had this CD for about 4 months or longer and it's the *only* one I play in my car. Even with the attention span of a gnat I never never never get tired of this CD. And for the life of me I can not understand why I'm not hearing Marc Broussard on the radio dominating the air waves like he deserves. Want to listen to something too good for radio? Buy it, you will not be disappointed."
5,5 stars for Marc,"Maybe I'm not really in the position to rate the cd's but I had the opportunity to hear Marc Broussard live. I recently returned from Iraq and he came and sung at our award ceremony. I'm not sure of the title but I think it was ""Home"". It was so warm and heart filling and soulful it brought tears to my eyes. I had to meet him and I did and he is just like his music. So here I am buying all his music and I'm pretty sure going to get much enjoyment from it all. LT Mona"
2,Just buy the single!,"In short, the first song, ""Home"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard! It has this Cajun-Soul-Funk that prevents you from sitting still. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD contains a lot of pop songs that don't come close to resembling the style heard on the first track. Whoever produced this CD must have fallen asleep after ""Home"". While I found it disappointing, I still look forward to the next CD release and hope that it will contain the style of music that Marc Broussard is obviously capable of recording."
1,One good song,"I was disappointed that the entire CD did not live up to the song, Home song ""Home."" Usually, we expect that the entire collection will have the same sound."
1,Consumer Alert!,"If you like ""Home"", the first cut on Carenco, then you can stop right there. Because the rest of the CD has nothing to do with that terrific song. This artist is still trying to find his voice and, at present, he seems to be channeling ghosts of the Doobie Bros., Stevie Wonder, Keb Mo and others. He absolutely can sing. Unfortunately, he has yet to develop his own style and sound (reminds me of ""Ray"" when he was cloning Nat King Cole). If he sticks to ""Home"", as was previously mentioned, then he's on to something. But if he goes for the fluff and commercial stuff, like the rest of the cuts, he will just be another good voice who sold out."
2,someone got loose from a boy band,"Okay, yeah - talented on guitar. The 2 stars are for the 1st track only - which I am still unsure why ""wade on the water"" lyrics are interjected, there, white boy. Yeah - I said it. That lead track is totally misleading. You think you may be getting something blusey w/soul... but the rest is SO manufactured. It's like a member from a boy band got loose...."
1,Good voice; rubbish lyrics,"I stupidly bought this on the basis of the thirty-second soundbite of the first track, which is absolutely the only decent song on the cd. His voice is strong and confident but his lyrics... Oy! ""When I get there you better be ready to rocksteady"" and ""You were sent here from the stars, that's the beauty of who you are"". To be honest, I can't be sure about the accuracy of the quotes as I skipped through the album, making disparaging noises. It actually took four people to come up with this poetry, if you can believe it.Come back to us in about five years, Marc, unless you are specifically aiming your music at pre-teen girlies. Great voice, though. For anyone who is interested, Marc Hest is more challenging and I'm totally digging that ""Keane"" cd. I think it's called ""Hope and Fears"". Think a non-suicidal Rufus Wainwright, pianos and all. The more morose amongst you can try Damien Rice, before all the hype carries him away. Good stuff."
1,Disappointing Yet Still Darn Awful,"I was just irritated after finding out that the rest of the album were bland love songs that were nothing like ""Home,"" of which I heard a live version on a late night talk show and persuaded me to buy the cd. ""Home"" is a hauntingly beautiful blues song that chills to the bone. The rest of the album is as immature and cheesy as modern ""R&B."" Then I heard a reference to Dylan and I flipped. One song begins, ""Dance for me girl as I strum my guitar..."" Seriously? Please don't mention Dylan in a song if you can't even come up with a decent line. If I was able to download a song or two of the rest of the album for free, I wouldn't have given this horrible excuse of an artist and his label any money. A great voice but get someone else to write for you or think about something other than a woman's skin and eyes."
3,Great!,"Like many others, I too first heard this artist at the Borders @ Pentagon. Once I found out who the was, there was initial shock, but I was glad that another talented musician was making ""music"" . This is a cool album, I still can't figure out who Marc Broussard reminds me of, but I see a lot of different elements in his style. The song that drew me, and that still remains my favorite is the bonus/hidden track. Equal parts soul/blues/rock/folk make this one of the best albums that I have heard in a while."
3,Worth buying for the vocals,"Despite some ho-hum pop songs and trite lyrics (haven't we heard enough of lines like ""break these chains and set me free"" and ""your touch is sweet as candy""?), Marc's major-label debut is worth buying. The chief redeeming feature is Marc's soulful, well-aged voice, an instrument that amazes because it's coming from a guy in his early 20s. In a perfect world, Marc would do a CD of R&B and soul classics or at least find higher-quality new material."
4,"Soulful, Entertaining CD","I've been a fan of John Mayer, Howie Day, Jason Mraz, and other singers in that genre for a few years now. I piced up Marc Broussard's cd a few months ago. Overall, it isn't one of my very favorite CDs, but there are a few songs that I could put on repeat and be happy with for days.The song in which Broussard shows the most talent is 'Home'. It gives off this amazing soul/blues/bayou feel that is hard to ignore. Every friend of mine who has listened to it has proclaimed Broussard a great singer, but then are less impressed as they go through the rest of the CD.Sample the CD on Amazon if you're thinking about buying it. It's always good to test the waters before you jump in."
5,It 's not hormone free.....,"I was thrilled with Marc's last Cd but this one really gets my hormones flowing like never before.....Is this too graphic? His voice is so sensual and soulful, that it resonates on a level that some of us have never experienced before.... I remember how crazy my older relatives were about Elvis and I never understood it.... I get it now.....Marc feels much older than his young-ness which is only a compliment to his maturity, wisdom and presence....These honorable qualities are worth noting and will serve him divinely throughout his life. If you have not heard the scratchy, tender, earthy-ness of his voice you're missing a round of pure delight. The instrumentals and lyrical recipes of his music are mouth watering and should be savored accordingly.....All of this feeds your soul.... Hips are meant to swing, feet are meant to move and your body is meant to sway......Let him assist you....Love and passion can move mountains.....Thanks for the jolt....."
3,Some nice tracks in the mix,"Marc's vocals are indeed very soulful and powerful. There's nothing that's really hard to listen to on this cd, but that doesn't mean I feel all the songs on this album are great. ""Home"" is my favorite track on the album, it's a powerful song that kind of reminded me of Joan Osbourne's ""Relish"" album, only with a male voice. ""Lonely Night In Georgia"" is also another keeper. Personally, none of the other tracks on this album do much for me. Nevertheless, I know there's plenty of people out there who will love this album, which is why im giving it a favorable review. He definitely has a great voice."
4,this rack is made for big bikes and big tread,"This rack is one of the best that I've ever used or have been around. Especially if you have a DH or a freeride rig. It loads quickly, easily accepts tires 2.5 and larger (I run a 2.75 front on my Bullet and don't have any problems), and it is very secure. It's really all you can want in a hitch mount rack."
5,One of the best of the Jefferson Starship era,"This strange album has a great cast: Jerry Garcia, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Craig Chaquico, Papa John Creach and the Edwin Hawkins Singers. I didn't like the other Grunt recordings as much as this one.Silver Spoon is fun to sing along with, despite the strange lyrics. Titanic is a two-minute condensation of what would become a three-hour movie 26 years later. Both are great for irritating teenaged children who disdain '60s music as antiquated.For the young 'uns out there: Diana was named for a woman who was killed in a townhouse when a bomb exploded prematurely (she was a member of the Weathermen radical group and from a small town in Illinois), although the lyrical sentiment is misplaced. The kid on the cover is Grace and Paul's daughter, China (who is the subject of the song of the same name.)"
2,Some songs paid for are STREAMED !!!!!,"After downloading several of the songs, I noticed that some were recorded at only 64 kbps. My first thought was that this was possibly recorded off of vinyl, but I then saw the icons in front of the song that indicated that these songs were being streamed to my system. I don't want to pay for streamed music? What the heck is that about.Pissed."
3,Only for the truly devoted,"I bought this CD on the strength of the other reviews. Until listening to it I thought that I was a true Grace Slick fan, but Sunfighter does nothing for me. It tries too hard to be the quintessential hippie/acid rock album and comes off sounding like a cliché."
2,"Time, time, time","It's incompatible with my MacLinkPlus; everything must become Appleworks 5 before it can then be translated into AW6 and the same thing works in reverse. I can't cut & past text from my old fave WordPerfect for Mac. And it's the slowest somemabitch, at least in iMac X+, that I've ever had the impatience to work with. Spinning wheel: working, working, working, all right already: finish working! It's basically sound, but I can't call up the usually codes to see what is really going on, as I could with WordPerfect. Its translation to html is a nice attempt but full of hesitancies, mistranslations, & that goddamned eternal spinning wheel: processeing, processing. I really think I *could* like this word process if they fixed up the speed, efficiency, & translatability, & added the ""seeing within"" features I like. [I had hoped WordPerfect would make something for Mac X+, but they say no.]"
3,Good,"This is my 2nd Spongebob DVD after Nautical Nonsense, and unfortunately.. I didn't find this one to be nearly as funny."
5,Not surprised,"What more can I say than... this is excellent. How can you go wrong with Spongebob? I have started collecting all the DVD's and of course, they're all excellent... you shouldn't be surprised."
