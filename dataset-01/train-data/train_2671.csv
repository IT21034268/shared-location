4,"Nice, fresh, but not unique","I just received my L'eau Par Kenzo and it is a very nice, light, unobtrusive perfume. So far it is not giving me a headache, which I am very prone to with perfumes, esp those containing musk. The bottle is nice and it sprays great. I just can't get over that it smells like Elizabeth Arden sunflowers, which reminds me too much of junior high in the early 90's. This should be a nice light day fragrance but I'm still searching for my signature scent. I guess it's time to actually go to a store and smell some perfumes, but you just can't beat the convenience and prices on Amazon."
2,A great scent if you like bug spray,"I don't usually rate perfumes because I really think it's a matter of taste.But this scent is very unelegantIt smells like ocean and citrus which is great,but the ocean smells a little toxic, and the citrus smells over-ripe.Smells an elevetor after an overly made-up old lady exits.Not recommended."
5,It is just wonderful!,"I got this perfume for the first time in 2000. And still, I cannot get over it. It is light and fresh. It makes you feel great! I think the fragrance is very unique and unforgettable."
3,"the book was pretty good,but not the best one that I've read","the book was alright, all of us liked it and in some parts didn't want to put it down. We were also bored in some parts and wanted to go to sleep. When I got done the book I was glad it was over with and I got some information on my part."
4,Drifting weight? Change the battery!,"We've used this scale for seven months now, for purposes that required 1-2 gram accuracy. After a month of use, we also noticed the drifting weight that other reviewers reported. However, the problem stopped as soon as we changed the battery. Since then, whenever the weights start to drift, we change the battery. There should be a real low battery indicator, and the lack of such indicator is a shortcoming of this product, but since we learned its ""trick"" we've been pleased with the scale's performance."
2,Average,"An average slasher movie, noteworthy only for a brief but memorable topless scene featuring the very beautiful Kathleen Kinmont."
1,There's a very good reason you've never heard of this movie before,"I bought this thinking it was a slasher - wrong. It's a third rate rip off of Animal House. Oh, there's a slasher subplot buried in there under all the painfully unfunny fraternity hijinks, but with all the silliness going on, these people couldn't create an ounce of suspense if their lives depended on it. The two main characters are as boring as can be, I couldn't even finish this crappy thing. There's a very good reason that all these horror/comedies are completely forgotten these days, while the straight slashers like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm street are considered classics."
3,Rush Week ! A week of parties and murders.,"Frat parties and outrageous pranks are happening all over Tambers College. Toni is a newly transferred journalism student, searching for a big story. But when a college girl who poses for a mysterious photographer turns up missing, Toni finds the story she's been waiting for. As more girls turn up missing jeff, the president of the Beta Delta fraternity starts acting strange. Soon toni recieves an anonymous warning to let the matter go. In the finale toni discovers the killer and gets her story."
3,Bedazzled Soundtrack,"First, the good news. The first track, Johnnie Taylor's ""Just The One"" is a fabulous number, and included in this cd is Brendan Fraser's hilarious rendition of ""The Dolphin Song"" as well as his dark, scary and convincing ""Inside of You Inside of Me"", which was cut from the film. The bad news: the soundtrack does not include the vibrant, tone-setting ""Bem Bem Maria"" (The Gypsy Kings) or the wonderfully appropriate closing theme, ""Change Your Mind"" (Sister Hazel). I found most of the tracks on this soundtrack forgettable or outright bizarre. In addition, the tracks are listed out of order on my copy. Overall, I found this to be a disapointment. Parts of it were good, just not enough of them."
2,The Song in your head,Makambo by Geoffrey Oryema is the name of the song when Elliot is in jail. I love the guitar but it has some funky lyrics (kinda kills it IMO).
4,"Wonderfully Hilarious movie, great soundtrack","This movie (if you haven't seen it- and by the way, if you haven't you really should) was unbelievably hilarious. The scrpit, story and acting are all excellent. The soundtrack of the film allows you to revisit the movie. It takes you everywhere, from a smooth Spanish tune (When Brendan Fraser is a Cuban drug lord) to a thigh-slapping funny rendition of ""the Dolpihn Song"" which is sung by Fraser himself (when he portrays the most emotionally sensitive man alive). The one flaw to this CD is that it doesn't contain the song at the very end of the movie, Sister Hazel's ""Change Your Mind"" which I think was a perfect ending song, and should have been included in the soundtrack. Overall, this was a fabulous movie and a soundtrack that makes you feel like you are watching the movie again."
1,Makambo,"I really wanted to find the song played after Elliot meets ""God"" in jail. I found out it is Makambo by Geoffrey Oryema. It's easily the best song in the movie, and not even on the soundtrack! But it turned out for the best--after I found the artist, I bought his CD, Exile, and the entire album is beautiful! Much better than this lousy soundtrack. Check it out."
3,To Russ from CA,"I'm pretty sure you're talking about ""Makambo"" by Geoffrey Oryema. It's on the Pure Moods CD. They DID leave out quite a few good songs from the movie, didn't they?"
2,"Good movie, makes you think","Yes, the movie is a little corny and at times feels fake. But it is entertaining nonetheless and carries an important message. I came looking for the soundtrack based on 2 songs (dolphin song was not one of them).Unfortunately, the song playing in prison and the song at the end of the movie are not on this album. For those, you need to look to[...] for Makambo and to [...] for change your mind.Check them out!"
2,this soundtrack could be better,i've been looking for the name of that song that plays while he's in prison for 2 weeks now... i knew i heard it before but i didn't know where.. makambo.. awesome... i had the pure moods cd back in the mid-late 90's this saved me a lot of searching and brain racking... thank you for those who posted on this topicthis soundtrack only gets a rating of 2 because it has the dolphin song on it
2,ANOTHER QUESTION,"Does anyone know the name of the song that was playing when Brendan Fraser was walking around by the bay bridge, thinking. It was a slow guitar song, with light vocals. It also is not on the Soundtrack."
2,Bedazzled,"I am trying to find the name of the song that plays when Elliot's first wish comes true. There is a Spanish song that is played, when he wakes up and he is a Spanish millionaire.. If anyone knows, please let me know. Thanx"
4,Great Starter Mic,"I love my 302! I have owned them since December 05. I previously used the Altec Lansing 202 and I like the 302 better. The sound quality is very good (maybe even great, I love the extra cord; it lets me to move around when I use them. The headset feature frees my hands and allows for portability. They are very durable, I fold them up and throw them in my work bag almost every day and they haven't broke yet. The only flaw is the headset is not adjustable, most likely because of the hinges on the fold don't allow it, but since these are wrap around headsets your ears hold them in place. I did not recommend the 302 for children since their ears may not be big enough to support the headset."
3,"Great Sound, Delicate Headset - Broke in 7 months","Its a nice set in terms of sound quality. However the band is thin, and not very sturdy. The worst part is that it feels very flimsy at the joints, and i'm always scared of breaking it. Btw, I've got this set 2 days back only, so these are just first impressions. Mic is good too, and it folds back easily, so it doesnt come in your way when you're not using it. Also the set is nice to look at. And the volume control is very handy, specially when you're listening to Launch, and some songs are louder than others.If you are a careful user, then buy it. However, if you're like me, i.e. a little careless, then go buy a sturdier headset.UPDATE : The headphones finally broke along one of the flimsy joints. This set has lasted me about 7 months only...a waste of $25 i think. Definitely a resounding NO to this pair of headphones."
2,Works until breaks,"The Altec Lansing AHS 302 does its job superbly, espicially for its low price. But, it breaks way too often. I had two sets break in less than 6 months. The microphone stops working and the speakers start buzzing a little. If you want a good headset for several months this is worth it, otherwise stay away."
4,Good Reliability & Quality,We have 2 of these in our house (soon to be 3). We have found them to be quite reliable. Much better quality than you might expect for the price. Good quality sound from the headset & the Mic is quite responsive. An all around good value.
4,I loved the Idea of Magnetic Writing....,"... on my fridge or the side of my filing cabinet, but despite having two different sets, I never seem to have enough words to say what I want. Maybe I'm just too wordy? I don't know, but they sit unused now in my office. Maybe they would have gotten more use in a family with teens, or junior high kids. There's a local coffee shop that has a set out for the customers to use on the back of their coffee machine bar and there is always a message or two there when I go in. It's whimsical and catches the eye and imagination of strangers. The box is good, it still holds all the pieces after you break them apart. I have no quarrel with them, I just find I don't use them much."
2,A few decent ideas,"Just a series of tips articles. I was looking for something that gave me an ordered way of maintaining a boat in good condition. This was more directed at - if you let things get to this point, then you can get back in shape this way."
3,Just OK,"I read through this in a short time. It just does not have any in depth information. A few good tips on how to use less expensive cleaners that what the mainstream suppliers are selling, but not much of anything else."
3,Sting Returns,"Eh. The NWO was still relatively fresh at this point and every match was decent or better. Recommended for the great main event and the return of Sting, who beats up on all the members of the NWO."
2,WCW Uncensored 1997 Review,"The review down below is totally incorrect, he's talking about Uncensored 1998. This one had a 3 team no-holds-barred match between WCW, the Horsemen, and the nWo, plus Eddie Guerrero defending the US strap against Dean Malenko, (may I add those are the two best matches on the card) then you have a battle of the former American Males as Marcus ""Buff"" Bagwell faces off with Scotty Riggs in a strap match. Uncensored 97 you could say was a ""turning point"" for WCW as Sting came from the rafters during the main event and attacked the nWo after months of silence and sitting in the rafters. This PPV was ok, I wouldn't pay 60.00 though, save that for a good and current PPV like Road Wild 99. This PPV is only good for the first and last match."
3,Nicole Chambers,it is not as much fun as I thought it would be but the price was great and it was in good condition. Seller got it to me asap.
5,elegance songs,"Yanni is one of my favorrite artist.I bought many of his albums and books.The song that I like to play most(piano) is "" In the mirror"". There is a feeling that can't express when I play it .The song is just non-stop that make it's great! His other songs are wonderful too such as Before I go, In the morning light,One man dreams these are not hard to play,but hard to play them as well as in CD.I would like him to play a concert in Thailand and compose a song for us....Wow! If anyone reading this text and want to talk to me about Yanni or Music,it'll be very kind of you to mail to me to share our opinion together."
4,In The Mirror,"This CD is a selection from other CDs he's made, but it's still good, because I do like the selection. And, it's in good condition - purchased through Amazon."
3,Worth the price of admission,I purchased this CD for a few of the songs I had heard elsewhere. It's a good album and I'm happy with it.
1,Dosn't work!,looks nice but wont even hold up my bike. dont bother buying this item. It was a waste of money
4,UDO - Mastercuter - Pure Classic Metal,"If you are an Accept or UDO fan this CD will not dissapoint. Great production, classic euro-metal songs. Great guitar solos (though we all miss Wolf!!) You can't play this without banging your head. ""The Wrong Side Of Midnight"" sounds like it was lifted off Russian Roulette. The rest of the CD is just in your face metal the way it should be.Dear God,PLEASE let music like this regain popularity in the States. UDO needs to be the opening act on the next Priest Tour!!!!!"
2,Took a little trimming to fit...,"Excellent brake pads, however the machining on the steel backing could have been a little more accurate.One shoe, when set against the caliper backstop, stuck nearly a 1/4inch outside the rotor. It tooka grinder to wear down the metal on the shoe to get it to set flush. I put it down to poor qualitycontrol."
4,More course changes for Moorer,"Alison experiments with yet another genre in her fifth album, Getting Somewhere, and it's not as successful as previous experiments. This album has a lot of pop/lite rock flavor to it. Many songs have a much faster tempo to them, consistent with that genre. A number of tunes are catchy: Work to Do, Fairweather, and If Its Just for Today being the most obvious. The album as a whole, however, just doesn't quite have the feel of serious art like some of Alison's other work. It seems a bit hastily assembled in parts. The faster tunes also have the effect of dampening, or at least making less noticeable, the excellent and unique qualities of Alison's voice. She sounds more like a generic singer. On songs that are slower, like Getting Somewhere and, especially, Hallelujah, her unique voice again comes out and it's a good thing. I like this album, but it isn't Alison's best."
3,Getting...Where?,"After a series of trad/alt/prog roots-country collections, Allison is the last artist you'd expect to sell out, but upon first listen of ""Getting Somewhere"" you'd swear she's dog done gone and done it. But it's not the pop land her countrywomen contemporaries have run to. On ""Getting Somewhere"" Allison seems to have embraced her inner Go-Go. Souding more like Belinda Carlisle than Faith Hill, the songs are full of crunchy guitars, hummable hooks, Beatlesque chord changes and frosty harmonies. Not one track clocks in over four minutes, making them sound abbreviated at times. Gone are the meditative spaces that gave breath and breadth to songs on her previous two releases. That's not at all to say this album is bad, but if you're expecting ""The Duel, Pt. 2"" you're bound to be disappointed. Allison may be ""Getting Somewhere"", but just where exactly where remains to be seen."
1,One step forward two steps back,"Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive disappointment.Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately."
5,FANTASTIC,"AS WITH HER OTHER CD'S, THIS ONE IS ALSO AT THE TOP. SHE IS A FANTASTIC SINGER, ANDCO CAPTIVATING. HER SONGS WILL LAST A LONG TIME..."
2,Buy 'Show' instead,"Wow, did someone slip the wrong CD into my jewelbox or what?If you're a fan of Allison's other work, epect nothing like what you've heard before. This is mostly a pop album, and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering. The sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding. Even Allisons voice has no drive to it.Steve Earl is no match on the guitar for Joe McMahan who played on the Show CD/DVD."
1,what happened??,big disappointment!! allison moorer (with the help of her hubby steve earle) has gone soooooo hollywood/pop star!! i do not like the new record and do not like her new image! she was much cooler two years ago! Too Bad!
3,"Great, but sound needs work and problems with kdevelop","I am also a reviewer from Alaska.I really like RH 9, but seems I have never got sound to work on many different combos, whereas Mandrake had no problem with sound.However, my main concern was when I installed ""everything"", kdevelop would not work correctly. In RH 7 it worked just fine...Anyway, With the ease of installation you now get from the Linux distros, Windows needs to start getting it together, or it will slowly become history..."
3,Easy ha...,"Linux isn't for your average user. Windos is made easy for those people that don't have the vast knowledge to use linux. It's features are greater than windows, the main point is Open Source Code. Windows does most of our actions for us. Linux its all manual, even sometimes the installation. Windows doesn't want you to change the source, or copy it. Linux was built by the programmers for the programmers. Getting things to work yes it does take some work. Linux isn't windows everythign isn't supported. You have to troubleshoot your own probelms on linux. If you need help for using it buy a book or go on some forms and ask some questions."
1,Better left to guys with a pony tail,"It is obvious to me that simplicity is not a virtue in the Linux world. Basic chores like getting a modem to work or installing and removing an application are hair-pulling experiences, the frustration compounded by fragmentary or non-existent documentation. RedHat did the right thing in pulling this monstruosity from the shelves -- it shouldn't even be sold to end users."
3,Are you kidding?,"Its ok...but dont for one minute think that Linux is LESS of a security risk. What a joke that previous reply was, considering Linux released more ""patches/fixes"" last year than Microsoft. The product itself is probably the best it has ever been, (thanks to the open source community) ;) Still compiling and configuring isnt for the noobies out there....(yet) :)"
3,"Was good, no longer.","Red Hat was a pioneer. It ruled the Linux world at one point. Not anymore. The company has announced their decision to exit the retail linux market and the end-user linux distribution. They will focus on the server market and the business/corporate clients.If you want a good Linux for home or office use and you are experienced, get SuSE 9.0 pro instead. If you are a begginer and want to move from the expensive/buggy/intrusive Windows platform to Linux, try LindowsOS 4.0."
4,Great sytem,"I recently started using this product and I feel it's very user-friendly. There weren't any hitches in the installation, comes with an excellent disk partitioning system that enables you to do some great partitioning and dual booting before installing. The list of programs and features are excellent. If you don't mind reading help files to get the gist of the programs you'll be fine. And the price just can't be beat."
1,DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX!,"Based on the reviews and comments I read about this product, I thought it a great deal for the money. Was I wrong! The product did not work right out of the box. Called tech support and was told there was a problem with the programing and to return the item; which I did and requested a refund instead of a replacement."
1,Just an entry level equipment,"The User Manual does not explain how to update the maps, excluding and including news informations and cities.There is no standard functionality that allows to view pictures and videos. The user must be a software expert to get into the application for coding the necessary changes to make available the above functionalities."
5,My GPS is very nice,"Jensen GPS is affordable, works super nice. It has salved my life to many times. jojojoJensen NVX-225 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator"
1,Don't Waste Your Money on 5-Year-Old Maps,"The maps on this unit are from 2004 and 2005. There is no update available for them. Consequently the GPS is constantly showing your position in the middle of a farm field or telling you to drive off a cliff. The Canadian maps are all off by at least 1000 yards, so even when you're on an existing road it doesn't know where you are. The manufacturer has been promising an update since 2007 and it has not and most likely will not ever show up. So unless you have money you want to throw away, don't even think about buying this item. 0 stars!"
3,nice!!,"Jensen's portable GPS device is nice,although usage as a pedestrian during inclement weather is not entirely reliable as the satellite signal tends to disappear."
2,FA Premier League 2008 Review of the Season,"The review was not as thorough as I thought. I'd rather buy the FA Premier League 2008 Goals of the Season, instead."
1,ordered 2/11/07 still not arrived 5/8/07,"This was offered as a special valentine's day special freebie to go with another Le Creuset item ordered 2/11/07. Finally received main order end of April. This Heart Ramekin has still yet to arrive. I have received 2 notices letting me know of a delay. Now it is scheduled to ship mid June. I would cancel, except I purchased the entire thing online simply because I thought I was getting this cute Heart Ramekin free for Valentine's Day. No compensation or anything (not even free express shipping).Watch out for Amazon."
3,Cute but not that useful.,"Cute, of typical fine Le Creuset quality, but too small for an adult entee, and of limited use for anything else."
4,"Pretty fun, but does have some shortcomings","Santa brought this game for our 5, 7 and 8 year old kids. It didn't interest my 5 year old too much, the others like it. Basically, you are dealt 5 ""attractions"" cards and you roll the dice to move your piece through the Magic Kingdom to see your 5 attractions and leave before anyone else.The directions included are a little confusing and it does take a few minutes to set up, but the main problem I see with it is the spaces to move your piece on are very small -- and some of them are very close together which makes it hard for the kids to move along the playing board easily. I do think that this game would be more fun and interesting if a recent trip to Disney World is fresh in your mind. I think if a child had never been to Disney World, they probably wouldn't be as excited with this game which relies heavily on real Disney attractions.Overall fun, a very busy, crowded playing board but recommended for the family that has been to Magic Kindgom"
4,Disney's Magic Kingdom,"We recently visited Disneyland and I purchased this game to help remind my 10 and 8 year old of the fun we had. There were a few rides I had never heard of and the rides I did know of were in odd places on the board but we have a blast when we play it! When it's just me and the kids, it is pretty straight forward but when it's many adults playing it can get hilarious!! The instructions were a bit confusing in the beginning but easy to remember, once you get it. It is a relatively quick game that my guests beg to play as well as my children. It was a good investment in family togetherness and great at reminding us all of our wonderful vacation."
5,A negative review???,"I can't believe I just read a negative review of this game. This is one of the most fun and entertaining games my children and I have ever played. My kids are 11 and 7 and they both love it. It's a GREAT family game that teaches strategy and thinking ahead. The spaces are just fine in size. The only problem is seeing the spaces behind the castle. That's it. Otherwise, it's wonderful. We love to use this game to reminisce about our Disney trips as well!"
4,good game...pro's and con's,"My daughter loved this game. She loves the little 3 -D items on the board and it is easy to understand how to play the first time. I only wish the designers had made the ""stepping stone"" places on the board a little larger and maybe not right behind some of the 3-D items, making it a little akward to navigate sometimes. We also had to decide if some spaces...such as the autograph spots...were meant to be spots to count in our turn or not as the directions did not clarify. Otherwise, I did love the fact that it was very easy to play and that I am using it to introduce to my daughter the layout of the park; how it is divided into lands, etc. I even use it for reading practice for my girl as I ask her to read the description of each attraction on her cards when it is her turn to lay a card down. Glad I bought this game."
5,Love this game!! Oh yeah and so don't my kids!!! :),"Great game to play as a family, especially if you are a Disney World lover!!"
1,Don't buy this game!,"My daughter got this game for her 6th birthday. It may be a better game for older kids, but i think it is a bit hard for a 6 yr old. The directions are pretty complicated and there is just too much to remember to do!"
3,Fun but not the best game,"We like this game for the idea that we can pretend to go to DisneyWorld anytime we like. The stone spaces are hard to count for the little kids, and sometimes the game is more complicated that it really needs to be, but you can adjust it to fit your family's needs. Overall, it is fun and amazingly accurate in the placement of the rides in the park."
4,Great for Disney Lovers ... But make sure they're old enough!,"I knew my daughter was well under the recommended age for this product but she loves Disneyland so I thought this would be a nice gift to play as a family. The board is beautiful which makes things fun. The problem mostly is that my daughter is too young for this game. She gets the ""Attraction"" cards and doesn't want to go there, she wants to go where SHE wants to on the board. In a couple of years this will probably be one of her favorite games. I would recommend this game to families who enjoy Disneyland/Disneyworld and who have children within the recommended age range."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.,"Since I really enjoy biographies and I missed this one on A&E;, I picked it up and enjoyedit, although it seemed to run very short and I felt as if I didn't really know that much moreabout Maria Callas after watching the DVD than I did before. Still, if you want to know theback story about this great diva's life and you can pick it up at the right price, it's wortha look."
4,Good,"I bought this CD having never heard of the band. I really like it. The song writing and playing are really good. I bought it to hear Dave Grissom, but he's only playing guitar on a couple tracks. Even so, this disc is currently in my disc changer and will likely stay there for a while."
1,Too Big!!!,Demasiado grandes!!!Tooo Bigggg!!!At the description they must say they're women's' sunglasses.The material also seems very cheap.I will buy Bolle no more...Sorry I spent my money in this out of fashion skeleton.Se debe especificar que son lentes para mujer.El material parece barato de muy mala calidad.No compraría la marca Bolle otra vez.
5,excelent,"e x c el e n t weapon and cvery interesting tool, good piece for colectioning, i like to much"
3,decent,"here's the gig, the blade itself is ok. the fittings and handle and sheath are all kind of crappy plastic though. the weighting is just silly and the tiny two accompaniments are flimsy poop. i'd not recommend for much more than a collection piece."
4,Too many weddings can drive a gal to murder,"Meg Langslow, in a moment of temporary insanity, has agreed toplan not one but three weddings. Throw in the murder of one of her soon-to-be in-laws and several mysterious accidents and Meg is soon working on a case of permanent insanity. Saddledwith a clan of eccentric kinfolk, the only real help Meg gets is from Michael, the dishy, but alas, gay (or so it is rumored),theater professor, currently running his mother's dress shop forthe summer. I started this series with the 2nd book, Murder withPuffins, and enjoyed it so much I had to come back and read the first. Meg's oddball family is amusing and yet believable. The mystery is also quite good."
5,Laughed out loud!,"The sometimes stressed to the max daughter of an outrageously eccentric family tries to organize three weddings, solve murders, and keep her eye on a very interesting man. Even the neighbor dog is a character!So funny! I am anxious to get her next book which will have same heroine! I think I recognise some of these folks."
2,tries too hard to be funny,"This book dragged on sooooo long, then at the very end, all of the sudden eveything was zipped up tight. I got the feeling that the author had a page limit and didn't know how to fill it, then realized she only had 5 more pages and figured she'd better actually do some murder solving. Utterly ridiculous and totally unbelievable."
3,"Well written and amusing, BUT","Over the top with too many wacky characters. Some fun moments, but overall the pacing was too slow and as another reviewer said, easy to put down."
2,rather dull,"I know everyone seems to like this book. Perhaps it is good for what it is. However, the 'zany' and 'whacky' characters and situations felt forced and came off more annoying than amusing. And I found that I did not like the character of Meg very much. Her martyred doormat approach to dealing with the brides and her family irritated me. I did like Meg's mother - her genteelly blase' attitude was very entertaining. I doubt I'll read the sequels."
1,"Take these annoying characters, please!","I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer of May 7. What sane person would put herself through the aggravation of 3 weddings in one summer? A fictional one, of course. I'm sure the author wanted humor and wackiness, but I only wanted to strangle the ""heroine"" every time she let someone order her around (and she never complained out loud, only inwardly to amuse the reader)(I guess). The mystery wasn't very captivating, and neither was the ""hero"". I'm going back to the mysteries with fiesty slueths who don't let others push them around."
3,"Murder with PeacocksThe first mystery in Donna Andrews' Meg Langslow series, Murder with Peacocks is a laid-back and comfortable","The first mystery in Donna Andrews' Meg Langslow series, Murder with Peacocks is a laid-back and comfortable book, perfect for slow evenings after a long day. As an author, Andrews doesn't seem to ask much of her readers, and instead lets them drift along as she develops her story at her own pace. Murder with Peacocks doesn't ""pop"" like many mysteries do, but the style of the writing just adds to the slow enjoyment of the reader. I will certainly be pursuing the series in the future."
5,Really Funny!,"Move over, Janet Evanovich and Jennifer Crusie! Here comes another terrific author who writes hilarious mysteries! MURDER WITH PEACOCKS is a great read - very funny and very entertaining! The main character is Meg, a bridesmaid in three weddings this summer. Then a murder occurs. In between writing invitations, booking peacocks and other sundry bridesmaid duties, she attempts to solve the mystery.Add other fun characters, hilarious situations and a dropdeadgorgeous leading man (who I imagined to look like Greg Montgomery from Dharma and Greg), and you will have finished this book in no time! Bravo, newcomer Donna Andrews! Write some more - you're GOOOOOD!!"
4,A HIGHLY ENJOYABLE NEW VOICE,"I am always on the look-out for a new author in the field of cozy mysteries, but I am picky-picky. Donna Andrews pushed all the right buttons. Her sleuth is very amusing without being cutesy. Her plot works well, fresh without reaching for unlikely coincidences. And the humor was marvelously well done. I was also happy that, for once, the romantic interest wasn't a cop as I'm having trouble believing lately that there are enough unmarried, gorgeous detectives in the world for every female sleuth to have one. (I wish it were true, goodness knows!) Anyway, I'll definitely be buying Ms. Andrews' next book, MURDER WITH PUFFINS because I've come to care for the characters."
4,For Anyone with a Crazy Family,"For anyone with a crazy family - and that's just about everyone - Murder with Peacocks will make you laugh out loud. I was completely swept away by this breezy and fast-paced tale, which somehow manages to blend weddings, blacksmithing, and peacocks with flair. I also felt that Donna Andrews managed to capture the small-town atmosphere just about perfectly, while juggling her many plot threads. This was my first Meg Lanslow mystery, but it definitely won't be my last! (P.S. to anyone who thinks all these family antics are over the top: You clearly have never been to an Italian wedding....)"
3,"nice idea, but long on execution","Just about any woman can tell amusing if not horror stories about wedding planning, either as a bride or bridesmaid. Since the lead character in this novel is saddled with three weddings, there are plenty of moments that women can identify with and laugh at. However, Andrews drags out the plot too long with one too many visits to the seamstress, one too many examples to show just how eccentric her father is, and one too many almost-but-not quite encounters with the man she desires but doubts she can have. I was ready for the ""I Dos"" to come much earlier than they did."
3,Heroine is a wimp,"This book had quite a few funny bits in it, but the heroine struck me as a total complete hopeless dishrag. Why was she doing ALL the work for the weddings? Why did she care if the weddings were perfect if the brides were unwilling to do any work for themselves? If the best friend can't exert herself enough to choose a wedding dress, that would be *her* problem, not the heroine's. Why did the heroine have to address all the wedding invitations for her sister-in-law to-be? She didn't have a broken arm! It struck me that NONE of the brides-to-be did any work and it irked me that heroine took it all upon herself. Other than that, it was a great first effort and if the heroine gets some spine in the next book it could be great."
1,Yawn,"So let me just start by stating that I wasn't expecting great literature when I picked up this book. I just wanted a light, breezy summer read. Uggh! Breezy it was! I was so disappointed with this book. The characters were not developed and completely one dimensional. The main character Meg, was the most boring of them all. The supposed wacky, eccentric characters were completely forced and not all that interesting or fun to read about. The ""mystery"" is ridiculous and the weak motives of the murderer and one of the brides was completely unbelievable. Don't waste your money or your time!!!!"
3,Where's the mystery?,"Yes, there is a murder and a slueth but this really isn't what one normally expects a ""Murder Mystery"" to be. It was lacking in a coherant plot and was more about the trials of being a bridesmaid. And it has a predictable ending. I probably won't bother reading it a second time."
4,Humorous Mystery,"Murder with Peacocks was a delightful book. Donna Andrews writes using a wonderful humorous tone, which is most refreshing after reading so many novels that focus mainly on slash and gore descriptions. The character's family is very colorful and quirky, and she brings the small-town people to life.This was a pleasure from beginning to end, and one needn't worry about reading it all alone at night. It's obviously designed for reading enjoyment, rather than to terrify.This reminded me of another author whose books I enjoy immensely; Janet Evanovich. Both authors write with such a vivid descriptiveness, that you feel like you personally know the characters."
4,Cure for a Bad Day,"Funny and a good mystery, too! But even more, it was the perfect book to make me feel better when I was sick at home on a grey day.A cast of crazy family members driving the protagonist crazy is something we can all relate to. There's also a really good slice of contemporary life satire at the same time. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
1,A big disappointment,"After reading the summary of the plot and several reviews, I thought this would be a good book to read on a sunny weekend. WRONG! This is the first and only book I read by this author and it will probably be the last. It really didn't have the plot that I expected and the characters were just a little over the top. If you like Janet Evanovich then maybe this if a book for you. I thought Andrews would be a little like Anne George but the only thing she had in common with George was that the story took place in the South. I admit I had to do a lot of skimming and skipping to get thru the book. Sorry I couldn't give a more positive review."
5,Playdough Party!!,"My 4 year old daughter loved this toy!! (OK, so maybe I did too) She played with it for 3 days straight (only a slight exaggeration due to sleeping, eating and errand time)The molds and tools are SSSOOO cute! It makes little muffins and cookies that are a lot of fun too. I really cranked on the teapot, and it held up very well under pressure. The only drawback I found was that the dough's smell was a little annoying, (it is scented to smell like flowers or strawberries or something like that) but I ususally find most smells annoying. Deffinately worth the money!!"
3,The Chimps,This book was an interesting book because it gave me information of a chimpanzee's life. It told me how chimps are related to humans. This book is a great source of information about chimpanzees. [Gladys Diaz]
3,Excellent comparison of German and UK IPO experiences,"Compares the impact of German and UK financial markets on corporate governance, ownership and financial performance during the 1980s. Fails to find a correlation between ownership patterns and financial performance. The German system favors firms with low risk and where the benefits of monitoring outweigh the cost of low portfolio diversification. The UK system is better suited to high-risk, high-tech firms, where founders are able to sell out rapidly. editor, CorpGov.Net"
1,For Bass Vocal Lovers Only,"The music in this collection is rife with oppressive music sung by bass soloists. It is disturbing and irritating to listen to for more than a few minutes.There are other much more lively and representative Ukrainian collections, and while the music is authentic, the delivery is wanting, unless you really do want to feel the pain of the Cossacks over and over and over."
2,Will not win any awards,"A quick read that might hold your attention for a few hours. Will not win any awards for creativity or originality since the formula is very Jackie Collins - a ""scandal"" in the Hollywood community that touches the lives of a number of different people and the root cause is a person who has risen to fame from some unfortunate and humble circumstance, has become bitter and evil as a result of their earlier experience and means to take revenge on others. I will not try to predict or judge whether or not you will enjoy it - if you like Jackie Collins type books you probably will enjoy. Just don't wait for this to be an Oprah Book Club selection - that's not likely to happen."
3,excellent,"flo, i loved your book1 it was excellent. it was the first book of your's that i have read. i am definitely hooked. i would have never figured out the ending. when i read it, i was totally shocked. i would have never guess the book would end up the way it did. from reading the book, i would have never guessed that about charlie. for our school newspaper, i am going to wtrite a review of your book. stay encouraged. nene"
3,"Keeping Secrets, Telling Lies",Received in good condition and in a timely manner. Great for those who like soap operas/gossip.
2,Needs a price reduction,The book was heavily laden with designer name dropping. The plot was slow and could have used more development. Hollywood names were tossed around without any clear relevance to the story line.I think with a little more character/plot development and a lot more story editing this could become at least a three star book.This book is priced as a hard cover..this need to be changed!
2,Did We Read the Same Book?,"Purchased for the hype but let down by the style. It reminds me of the effusive praise I had in 2001 as a freshmen student in Economics for Tyco and Dennis Kozlowski. Every word is lavish spectacle and Gatorade can seem to do little wrong. I want the hard hitting truth about corn-sweetener and who should really drink this.There is a foray into marketing strategies whereby you the reader are versed on the importance of customer profiling by your savior, Saint Gator of Indiana. Many phrases are repeated (really, they have to hot wash the bottles you say?) and some of the sentence structures are downright bizarre.Fairly good party talk though. Margie, did you know the University of Florida sued for profits years after initially scoffing at investing in the concept?"
3,Good book - a little too much on the fanboy side though,"I enjoyed most of this book, but the author crosses into fan too much. Also the last like 3 chapters are total filler. Good overall."
5,Inside Look,Rovell takes an inside look at how and the process of gatorade became a house hold name and the marketing it took to get there.
2,Grapplers Quest,This was the frist Grapplers Quest dvd I have ever bought and watched. I really love the UFC and the ground game so I would give it a try. It was ok. Not great at all. It takes place it what I can only assume is a high school gym. There is about 4 maybe 5 fights that have Matt Hughes in them. All in all it's not bad but I wouldn't buy it again. I would try to rent it from somewhere if I could find it for rent.
2,Some Interesting Events Narrated Scandalously,"This book tells how missionaries penetrated the Grand Valley and Western Dani regions in the highlands of West Papua.It does contain some interesting description of events in Wolo, Bokondini and Mulia.However, the style is very poor.For one, everything is put into a God vs Satan perspective - very bigotted even by missionary standards.Even worse, the way the author often describes Papuans prior to Christionaty varies from patronizing to scandalously derogatory - like calling them dirty, filthy and even ""degraded, inhuman, animallike nonanimals""!!!"
4,japanese yellow peony tree,"I ordered this in march 2011 ,came in great shape,since I live in New England & didnt expect it to ship so soon,emailed the seller who promptly replied with further instructions-still doing well in my window & growing big! Will plant aroung May 5 ,hope it keeps going till then."
4,It's poop lube- what do you want? LOL,Decent price for docusate sodium soft gels. They all work the same- no difference with these. Decent shipping time. Not much else to say- I got what I wanted :)
4,AAAwsome crash-ride!!!!!!!!!....,"This crash-ride cymbal is awsome--great sound,but one mistake Ithink that a crash-ride cymbal could sound better... Thats whyI gave it a rating of 4 stars"
4,They slip,"I have been wearing these ani-embolism stockings for over two years , to counteract edema in lower legs and ankles, However, they do not hold very well (stay up) around thigh, until I discovered a product called ""It Stays"" , and I recommend that highly. I believe it is available through Amazon. It has a roll applicator, much like anti-perspirant, in 2 oz. bottle, odorless, water soluble, and it does the trick ."
4,Good Quality for the Price,"The tables arrived quickly. They are solid wood and very sturdy. A good value for the price. Assembly was quick and easy, except for one bolt on one table that was a little tight. It took a little muscle to get that table together."
5,At Last,So happy to have discovered the tables and extremely happy with the quality and price. Put together in a short amount of time and they look great.
4,Just what I wanted,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KUQBCQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe nesting tables are perfect for the small space next to a chair. They are sturdy and attractive and were very easy to assemble. So much better than TV tray tables.
4,A Good Quality Cricket Food,I have been Breeding and rasing my own crickets for over 2 years and i have gone through alot of cricket feed products. My personal favorite is the Flukers cricket feed. It seems to me that the crickets live quite a bit longer when on this diet and seem alot healthier. The crickets need no help locating and eating the food and the high calcium in it make them a great gut load for your reptile.
2,"Eh, it works.","If you're going to properly gutload your crickets, I'd recommend using actual food or Fluker's orange cube instead of this weird sawdust stuff. It makes your cricket carrier a bit messy and I'm not convinced the crickets actually eat it, or that it would be nutritious for your reptiles. It does, however, cut down on cricket poop smell which is nice. I've actually converted to feeding my reptiles Phoenix Worms, which are naturally high in calcium and don't need dusting or gutloading. Also, they don't chirp like crickets so that's a bonus."
2,Causes Cricket Death?,"I ordered this product based on some recommendations from breeders/owners. Half of my crickets were dead the next day. They had appropriate water and supposedly this should be enough to keep them alive for at least a couple days; since everything I read talked about gut-loading for at least 24 hours with this product. I thought maybe it was a fluke (oh so punny!), so I purchased another batch of crickets and the same thing happened. I cleaned out the keeper and I switched to the orange cubes, which I ""float"" in the SoBe caps I use for the water dishes -- keeps crickets from drowning and keeps the cubes moist, and haven't had any problems since I started keeping the Hi Calcium product OUT of the keeper. Perhaps I have a bum batch? At any rate, I have an entire jar of this product with no intentions of using it again. I'll stick to the cubes."
1,crap quality DVD,"This is one of the worst quality dvd's I have ever seen, it is appalling, watched the first ten-fifteen minutes of it and gave up, it is totally unwatchable, it is pure crap, surely the people who release this stuff are breaking the law because...buying it is daylight robbery !"
1,Crappy print job,"This book has a glossy new cover, but it is a reprint, and inside the text is horribly printed. The type is swollen and blurry, and there are artefacts everywhere, making it difficult to read."
1,"seat covers are not camel, they are red/brown!","I ordered 2 in spite of other reviews saying their covers came red/brown, not camel...mine had the same problem. Not what I wanted, not what was advertised. Going back."
1,poor,"The seat cover quality is poor, not real sheep skin and it is shedding. I can say this as I can compare with the same seat cover I had purchased previously. The cover was packaged in a simple postal box - It should have come with a factory box"
3,It works,"It's lush, but much darker than the picture shows. The only other issue is there are attachment straps and we don't have anyplace to attach them, so the cover slides on the seat. It does it's job as long as you pay attention to the cover not sliding off the seat."
2,Fair Quality.,"After an exhaustive search for sheepskins, including the search through Costco & Sam's Club I finally found these covers. I figured as most would that items from Brookstone are usually of better quality than you would find from your typical source i.e. Sears, Pepboys, Autozone etc. After receiving the covers today you can imagine my dismay at seeing the quality, rather disappointed. The seating area looks as if it is a patch work, not a solid piece. I read every review from here and figured that these would be decent given the reviews, even though some were less than favorable. The less than favorable reviews were right, these are very disappointing as far as quality is concerned. You would be better off buying the higher end covers from Sears, the quality was comparable and they were $25 less for each seat."
1,Color is NOT as represented in picture!,"Huge disappointment!! I spent nearly $200 on car seat covers that are a horrendous color. Instead of the plush, light carmel in the picture, what was sent to me was a dark red/brown. They are gross. I'm going with gross. I so wish I had read other reviewers who had the exact same problem. Please, learn from us and save yourself the headache. I sure wish I had."
4,Almost right,"They put the apostrophe in the wrong place.. but all the pertinent info was correct. Durable, waterproof, VERY visible. Nice product"
3,the plastic version didn't last,"I bought the plastic tag and within a couple months my dog had scratched off the engraving enough that it was useless. I'm imagining the metal version is better so I'm going to try again with this company and get a metal tag. I haven't gone back to them with my experience - so don't know if they will make an exception here. If they do, I'll modify this rating and let you all know!"
5,love the plastic tag,"I ordered the small reflective plastic tag for my cat, Fuzzy, and he is very satisfied. Nice and light, doesn't jingle,and overall nice quality."
5,Highly Recommended For All Pets,The engraving was excellent and the wording was exactly as requested. The tag is very visible hanging from my dog's collar. The product was delivered on time. I recommend this tag for all pets.
2,wrong product,I ordered a pink pastic small star. I was sent a large silver star. It is still cute and I did put it on my 6lb Yorkie. A little large for her but still cute. I just wish it would have been the product I ordered.
5,Great Product!,"I ordered the Pet ID Tag- Star- Custom Engraved Dog ID tag. The tag was delivered on the 25th. 5 days before I was expecting it. It is nice sturdy brass, and the engraving is wonderful. There is no way my Shih Tzu will chew the info off of this tag like she has other tags I have purchase from other places. Really nice workmanship, quick ship, great price, A+. My only complaint would be that I purchased the wrong size. She weighs 12 lbs and I purchased a Medium. It is a little big for her. If I had it to do over again I would have purchased a small, but that was my error, not theirs."
2,Too small and too narrow,"The shoes are too narrow (and I have a narrow foot) and too small. The 9 felt like an 8 or 8 1/2. I wore them for a day thinking they might stretch a bit, but no luck. Now it's too late to return them. The price was right, and the quality was good, but that doesn't help me now. I can't wear them. 8^("
3,A sequel to Parvana's Journey,"I agree with the School Library Journal Review because when I started this book, I felt as if I had started somewhere in the middle of the story. I had heard of the name Shauzia, Parvana's friend who was supposed to be in Paris enjoying life but this book seemed to assume that we knew a lot more about Shauzia than we actually did. I feel the start of the book would have been stronger if there was a little more continuity from when Shauzia last saw Parvana. Although, I felt Shauzia's pain when she lost all her hard earned savings to the police, this book did not touch me as strongly as Parvana's journey did. One of the reasons could be because Shauzia seemed to be more self-sufficient and dare I say, self-centered? I would recommend this book as a follow up to Parvana's journey but it doesn't get a five star rating."
1,Not Very Royal For Me,"First, let me say that I LOVE this author's Undead series--5 star ratings all the way! But, this book didn't even seem to be written by the same person. I am far from a prude, but the language, especially from the ""heroine"" made me wince throughout. It seemed to me that every other word was the ""f"" word. I could deal with that if the book had been funny, witty and engaging. I thought the family was eccentric to the point of silliness--not amusing as it is intended to be. I didn't really understand the attraction between the two main characters, and I never warmed up to the heroine, which pretty much ruined the whole story for me. I just didn't find any redeeming qualities to this book. Too bad, because I think the premise of the story had great potential."
2,Wow.,"I say ""wow"" not because this book was good, but because of how different Ms. Davidson's writing was in this book! It was horrid. Sure she still has the sharp wit that we've seen in the Undead series and the setting of the story was really interesting, but what happened to the flow of the story? All of a sudden the lead character is at the castle and meeting the prince! I thought there was SUPPOSED to be a plot somewhere. Or maybe a little character development. Oh, Mary Janice. I still love ya, but I'm really going to have to try to forget this horrendous read."
2,What happened?,"I love her Undead series, I've read some of her novellas. This was a major disappointment. Actually an expensive disappointment. I was really surprised that the heroine was so unlikable and the hero so wishy-washy. The only person of substance was the King (the father). I gave this away without a whimper."
2,What were you thinking?,"The Royal Treatment? The sassy heroine is lacking in character. We have a King who is a foul-mouthed american. Why? The story chops between a future history written by the King's aid, which loses and confuses. Scencario is completely unbelievable and this is combined with cliched characters. And it got worse. I gave up and closed the book. Nice cover though."
2,Cookie-cutter and boring,"A good story in theory, I guess, but I just didn't buy it. It was almost decent, but something was lacking. I didn't feel the characters - they seemed a bit cardboard and unbelievable. And there wasn't much to distinguish it from the droves of ""common girl becomes royalty"" stories short of the attempt at a unique setting (which was just so-so).Her other series (Undead and Unwed) is far, far better. I don't think I'd recommend this one to anyone."
3,Fun read; author shows potential,"I picked this up for a quick fun read and it was certainly that! I was laughing throughout most of the book and enjoyed the characters. However, the book will not be a ""re-reader"" for me. The author does have a few things she could work on. Characters are snickering practically every page, plot points are made too quickly, and the ""book excerpts"" were more confusing than anything else.I'll keep an eye out for other books by Davidson. She could be a very good author if she can develop her stories a mite better."
1,"Badly Written, A Real Disappointment ...","What is going on with Mary Janice Davidson?? I am a big fan of her U&U; series; Betsy's adventures are hilarious, the books are superb fun.The Royal Treatment is *so bad* it hardly seems MJD would put her name on it! I felt the same way about Hello, Gorgeous!.I looked forward to this book for so long, but when I finally got it, it was so annoying that I didn't even finish it:(.I'll try MJD one more time, Undead and Unappreciated, #3 in her Undead series. I've taken all her other titles *off* my TBR list for now.I hate to say this, but that's how I feel after reading more of her! I'm hoping #3 U&U; lives up to the first two in that entertaining & highly enjoyable series."
4,A Great Read!,"I got the title of this book from a friend who'd just read it and I really liked it. The main character is funny and charming. Also, the plot twists in it are very surprising and kept me turning the pages. I'd highly recommend this book!!!"
5,Love it!,OMG I loved this book. It was great! I think that I might have liked it better than any of her other books. It was great. I read it in about 24 hours because I couldn't put it down. It was a fast read and I would recommend it to anyone!
1,Unenjoyable and badly written,"This book must be filler for the 'chick-lit' genre. I can see a publishing house grabbing any and all readable manuscripts of a popular genre and putting it out there with the usual cute cover. This is a badly written dog of a book. The heroine is obnoxious and foul-mouthed. I've read many other books that are set in fanciful places(here,the country of Alaska) with fanciful plots(here,a handsome, eligible prince saying 'okay' to an arranged marriage with a stranger) and the reader can suspend disbelief if it is well-written. This book is not one of them."
4,The Royal Tenenbaum's of Alaska,"I love reading reviews before downloading a book. I always read the reviews before hitting that ""buy with 1-click"" button. That button gets me in trouble often! I would just like to say that ROYAL TREATMENT is for relaxing, laughing, and finding the humor in the text.This book is not going to be on Oprah's Book Club for novels that have changed the course of mankind. This book is for those of us who need an escape!A reviewer asked if Davidson knew her character was shallow at times. Of course she does! This book is (repeat it with me) for PLEASURE. Im sure proffessors everywhere are not assigning it to students.The book is written very much in the style of the Royal Tenenbaum's. The central family is quirky, bawdy, and loud. They are a family one would ""want to follow."" Thus, their royal title sits well.I have many degrees. I am a professional. I am well read. Sometimes it is glorious to read a simple book for the sheer love of reading a neat story!"
3,fluffy entertainment,"In this slightly-alternate world of MaryJanice Davidson's, everything is exactly the same as our own - except that Alaska, instead of being sold to the US in the 1800s, broke away from Russia and became its own country with its own erm.. unique monarchy.Enter American Christina Krabbe (""It's pronounced 'Crab', no 'e.'""), a no-nonsense ex-cruise ship cook. She jumped ship upon quitting (due to an incident involving flooring her boss for sexual harassment) and found herself stranded in Alaska, only to be taken in by none other than the king himself - and set up with the crown prince as the future crown princess!This book is fun, lighthearted, and funny. Unlike Davidson's Queen Betsy series, the heroine of The Royal Treatment is smart, a fact which I greatly appreciated. Christina is smart, has a don't-mess-with-me attitude, knows what she wants and won't back down from anyone - not even the king himself, nor any of his five equally strong-willed children."
3,3 & 1/2 Stars!,"MJD rocks. We all know it. And while her heroine, Christina Crabbe, is somewhat like Queen Betsy of the Undead series their is a very big difference. Christina is completely irreverent of anyone - except perhaps Queen Elizabeth- and she's cheap. Cheap I say! Unlike Betsy who is decked out in Prada, Christina hates shoes and spending needless money. Oddly we can get behind either character simply because of their charisma.Stranded in Alaska( You know the sovereign country. The one that was offered to the US during the civil war but we declined to buy?)Christina moves in with the royal family and through an odd set of circumstances marries the crown prince. Life as a soon to be princess isn't always fun though and you get to see her courtship, engagement, and brief reign as Queen. Stay tuned for a royally good time and get ready for the new sequel, The Royal Pain!"
2,Just if you are a Morricone,"I been always a fan of Ennio Morricone's music. To me, this is a beautiful score, but it feels a little reiterative, as cold as the computers and corporative world the film depicts. I consider this score as a minor work, below the quality of ""The Mission"" or ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"" scores."

5,These puppy tags are wonderful and so are the folks that market them.,"I have 2 dogs, both are JRTs. I ordered tags for both of the dogs. On the first order, I misspelled ""Minnie,"" the dog's name. They gladly sent me a new tag for almost less than the cost of shipping.On the 2nd order, I provided an ""old"" telephone number, and not my current one. Again, they sent me a new tag with the proper phone number.How can one complain about people or a business who are so customer-oriented? My gosh, in today's world of a ""Global Economy"" maybe the Army is the only place left where they care about what happens to the individual consumer. Amazon was wise to align themselves with the marketer of these puppy tags."
2,Not Reflective,"I bought this tag primarily because it was advertised as reflective. My dog is black, and I worry about him getting out at night for that reason because he's difficult to see. That's why I was looking for a tag that would reflect light. As soon as it arrived, I turned off the lights in the room and shone a light on it. Nothing. It has a fine finish and is a good looking tag, but doesn't reflect any better than another steel tag would (and most of them are much cheaper). Perhaps I was mistaken as to what was meant by ""reflective,"" but when emailing the seller to get my personal engraving (as is required) I specifically requested a color that would be the most reflective and explained my reasoning as I have in this review. So, if I was mistaken the seller never took that opportunity to correct me."
4,Looks great!,We got a yellow bone with black writing--super cute for our pooch! 4 stars because the ring they send you to attach to the bone seems cheaply made.
1,all dog tags-got to the end of my order and no where to place what I wanted engraved on tags-but too late and order was sent-,I kept pushing continue as I thought a screen would come up for me to put in what I wanted engraved on the dog tags-it never did-how do you know what info I want on them? No way to cancel then so I'm stuck with tags I don't want.
1,Misleading -information,"From another reviewer: Tag came ok, but not engraved, just printed on, will not last. Stay Away from this product, misleading should read printed dog tag, which is pretty much useless, unless you have a dog that never goes outside, but in that case you wouldnt need a tag. Note that a review I sent a few minutes ago didn't get through Amazon censors. The above got through, and I second it. The stainless steel tags are NOT engraved, merely printed. The plastic ones may be ""engraved"" because they have a coating that is cut through. Not the stainless steel tags. they are merely printed."
1,Not a Keeper,"I love doing pilates, but I did not love this DVD. My main problem with the DVD is that the numbers for the workouts do not match the guide on the back of the DVD. Therefore, I had to watch each workout and the time for each workout to figure out which one was which. On top of this, the time for each workout does not match what the back cover of the DVD says. For example, if the back cover says a workout segment is 27 minutes, it is probably about 20 minutes. I am familiar with and skilled at most basic pilates moves so the actual workouts themselves were OK. However, I realize I am not a big fan of Ana Caban. Even being an experienced practitioner of pilates, I like the reminders on breathing and stance and that is not something that I found too much with this DVD. If looking for good full body pilates DVDs, I would highly recommend any and all of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs. I own them all and love mixing it up."
3,Good workout,"Like other reviewers, I was thrown off by the workouts not lining up with the back of the case.I worked through them and figured out the correct order. If you didn't see the review with the order it goes like this:1) AM Pilates with Jillian Hessel2) PM Pilates with Ana Caban3) Pilates for Weight Loss Maintenance with Ana Caban4) Cardio Pilates with Ana Caban5) Easy Pilates with Ana CabanOverall I find the workout challenging. This is my first attempt at Pilates, and I hope that I will eventually be flexable to do all the moves in the work out. I'm on my second week doing the dvd and I feel like I'm getting a grasp on the workouts an am motivated to improve. This is a great workout and with the longest one being 30 minutes is an additional bonus to me."
3,confusing organization and not the best workouts,"I am quite new to pilates but have done ballet for many years. This DVD is a little strange in that the level doesn't seem too advanced (aside from one or two moves) but there is very little instruction on how to do the moves. Ana and Jillian are shown doing the routine with a voice over that doesn't give much guidance on correct positioning or breathing.I was also as confused as everyone else about the random order of the workouts compared to the list on the back of the DVD. Also, why wouldn't they start with something easy and build up? It would make much more sense to have one introduction workout first which explains some of the moves.That being said, I like that there are a variety of workouts. However, they are all fairly short so you may have to do two in a row to get a real workout."
4,This is one of the DVDs that I consistently go back to,"I have had this DVD for awhile now and Ms. Caban is probably one of the better instructors. I got the DVD from Target, but I am learning that workout DVDs are much cheaper on Amazon. At first I was not to keen on her voice, but her instructions and method are probably one of the best in making sure that you do the exercises correctly. The only work out that sort of throws me off is Day 4. The very first/last workout is good when I have to get back to a workout routine and workouts 2 and 3 are workouts are good for when I have extra time to get ready for work or if I actually wake up when my alarm goes off."
3,starting to grow on me,"wish I had seen these reviews before I had bought this someplace else, at first I kind of was angry that I got this and thought it might just sit on my shelf, but I have been trying to alternate this with my other video and it's starting to grow on me. It is annoying that the DVD sequence on the back and the times are mismatched, but the quality is pretty good. the 10 minute routine is a nice easy warm up. I tried that in conjunction with one of the other routines and it made it easier - so it's great to stretch with that. The other routines other than PM, seem a bit too challenging, but I'm hoping as I get better and more flexible they'll be easier. Nice to have something to grow with a bit, and some quick routines for variety. But right now, I have to rate it 3 stars since I haven't been able to fully utilize this - plus I agree with others - the title is a bit misleading."
4,Very good.,"I had bought one from this series before so I knew what I was expecting. One of the sets however is a repeat from the first dvd I bought called Pilates Tone and Burn Collection. So I had a double up, which is a bit of a bummer but that aside these work outs are real good. You will need a stretchy band (used in pilates) for one of the sets also but its not necessary. I also thought, going by the title, that this would contain a workout for each day , like at consistant level. It does have workouts but they are more random, some easier than others. I would definately recommend buying this though. It has got a good range of workouts which is good if your a beginner. Also Ana Cabain is a fantastic instructor who has a sense of humour which is a must in my opinion."
5,Useful!,"I placed this in my bathroom, and it keeps me on track while I am doing my morning hygiene rituals, beauty treatments (peels, etc.), or just taking nice long baths. I even use it to monitor the the amount of time I swish around oral products in my mouth (like Plax and mouthwash), as these have generally recommended time periods for optimum effectiveness. The product is simple, small and unobtrusive, and it works...especially with the second hand."
5,"High quality clock. Be aware though, it is small","Pros:-Made of sturdy, high quality components-Very easy to stickCons:-Be aware, it is small. For my bathroom I need something about twice its size, at least.Overall:Unfortunately someone stole it off my wall when I threw a party. That said, the product was fantastic for what it was, a small, shiny clock with high quality components. That's probably what made the klepto steal it. But be aware it is way too small to be the only clock in a bathroom (it never claims to be big though so I can't deduct any stars)"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"""Get Your Captain's License"" is wholesale disaster from McGraw-Hillunder the International Marine label. From their web site International Marine cannot be reached by phone or email. The CD, supposedly generic, runs on Windows, not on Mac and if you dont like it,according to McGraw-Hill dont buy this hyped up book (ALTHOUGH this discrepancy does not appear in any of the ads). The text is rife with errors and misprints. Surly people at McGraw-Hill admit that if you bought the book you can send it back postpaid, a process that takes weeks for a refund on a book you bought to use, not to bicker over.It just ain't worth it!"
3,No 64bit support for test prep CD,"The book is well written and has all the necessary information, however the test prep CD that comes with the book does not work on win 7 64 bit OS and after contacting the publisher there is no support or patch to make it work."
2,You'll need more than this book.,"This book is frustrating because the learning consists of taking tests. There is not enough how to information. Also, the cd is supposed to randomly search the database and give a new test each time. However, after many practice tests I found that the cd did not access all the questions. Only because I also went through the written questions did I discover this. If you don't know this, you will not see all of the questions and you may need them all. On the plus side, the diagrams are what you will see in the real tests and the rules of the road are in the back of the book. I think it is very useful for drilling, not learning. This book should be considered a supplement. I recommend The Coast Guard License by Budd Gonder along with Chapman's and Dutton's for learning, and this book for practicing"
1,Close but NO cigar!,"This book has all the potential of being a great book for the captian's liscense exam, but falls far short. Poorly written chapters and there is no explaination to the exam questions. VERY frustrating. If anyone knows a good book to prepare for the Captains Liscense, I would appreciate an email (cjamesb@airmail.net) Bottom Line: Don't waste your money."
3,"Get Your Captain's License, Third Edition","This new 3rd edition is better than the fist two. It is not a complete guide to all you need to learn to test for a USCG License, but it is a good base. There are still a few corrections needed in the rules that should have been updated for this 3rd edition and not all the study text agrees with the USCG questions. The CD tests is okay for review and gives a good feel of what needs to be studiedfor the USCG exams. Over all makes a great referance and should help anyone looking for a lower level license."
4,This Classic Christmas Cartoon Should Be On DVD!,I saw this video tape when I was shopping one day and I bought it and I had never seen it before and when watched it I really liked it and I think it's very under-rated! The Cricket on tthe Hearth is based on a story by Charles Dickens and is about a toy maker and his daughter who's voices are provided by Danny Thomas and Marlo Thomas (a real life father and daughter) who are poor and being taken advantage of by a cruel and selfish toy factory owner. The cricket in the story is both narrator and friend to the toy maker and his daughter and is voiced by Roddy McDowell. This is a really good Christmas cartoon and I would like to see it transferred to DVD!
1,Seriously !?!?,"Watched this AWFUL, poorly animated piece of trash with my nephews over Christmas break. Lucky cricket? Give me a break! I can't decide which put me in the Christmas spirit more, the hysterical blindness, or the kidnappers who were murdered aboard the ship. The animation was one step above a bad acid flashback. This was one of those shows that was shown once, and shelved. Be afraid, be VERY afraid! Did Danny Thomas not read the script before he signed a contract? Marlo should sue..."
3,A nicely done Christmas cartoon for kids,"Saw it just recently on the Fox Family channel. Though this animated holiday show featured the voices of well-known celebrities and was produced by the company that makes the greatest Christmas cartoons such as ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Frosty The Snowman"", it was a bit slow and lackluster in some places. In this story, an eldery cricket narrates the tale of a young maiden in love with a prince, yet she and her father, the toymaker were cruelly exploited throughout the film. This girl is such a cute doll-like character with those senuous eyelashes and sexy-looking lips, yet she doesn't seem to react too well to the biggest surprises, like a villian suddenly being attacked by the cricket's animal friends and finally meeting her beloved prince in a disguise. As for the old cricket himself, he happened to play a part in this adventure as well in his younger days. A cute and rather heartwarming X-mas story."
3,Babar and His Family,this book is in great condition but I thought it would be the size of the other Babar books.It's smaller than our other hard bound Babar bookis.
3,A little long before getting to the point.,Some of the chapeters are a bit confusing while attempting to get to the point but eventually gets there. This is not the book if you are looking for quick answers. If you are a complete novice and have time to read through this book it will give you insight into determining how to quilt your quilt.
5,Exactly what I expected,I am trying to learn more about designing my own quilting for my quilts rather than pay someone to quilt them for me. This is a beautiful book and one of the first quilt books I own that I am actually reading word for word. There are great practice sessions to help me learn how to think outside the box of traditional quilting and methods for making our own quilting very doable. I highly recommend it if you are looking for inspiration and education on enhancing your own quilting of your quilts.
2,The Beduoins,"This to me seems mostly to be covers by The Beduoins, the first group Dunhill brought in to replace P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri. The liner notes are lame so its hard to tell but it seems to be mostly a run of the mill rock band covering others' hits and some P.F. Sloan. I'd advise getting the P.F. Sloan demos if you want a truer taste of his music."
1,Everything is wrong,"I finally realized that what they mean by ""oven"" in this book is actually something like a desktop toaster oven used popularly in Japan and China where space is limited. So all the cooking time is way too long for real American ovens. Recipes are not good either, at least for those things I tried. I strictly followed the recipes, but the cooked dishes were not tasty. Some ingredients are hard to get in US too. This is one of the worst Wei Chuan cookbooks. Don't recommend it at all."
1,Poor standby time,According to its description it is 900mah. But it is not. I bought 2 of them and battery lasts only 12 hours. If you dont talk at all standby time will be 15 hours.Normally it is supposed to be good for 100 hours.Go and buy original one from motorola store.
1,Would have given 0 stars if possible,"The graphics are nice but that is about all, the game is jerky, steering is impossible and the jumping is laughable. Wouldn't spend a penny on this game let alone $20.00"
1,CTRL lets you jump,"Cheers; my daughter and I bought this and have been sorry ever since. The manual is on the disk, and only there can you find out that the CTRL key lets you jump. The graphics are distracting -- we found that if we changed the graphic settings to remove shadows and eliminate sophisticated effects it was less attractive but a little easier to steer the horse through the obstacles. Not worth all the trouble tho!"
1,This game is not worth your money or time.,"I received this as a gift some time ago and finally decided to try it out. Since you steer your horse with the arrow keys, and also determine its speed with arrow keys, it is very difficult to move with any speed through the courses. If you don't slow to a walk, you'll end up running into the rails, barriers, etc. They don't tell you up front that the CTRL key is for jumping, and the left shift key is for the whip. You have to find the manual(pdf file), which is not even mentioned on the display for the game, or even the packaging on the one I got. I'll give them credit for interesting landscape graphics, but that's about it."
3,arrow lags,My daughter loves horses and really wants to play this game but the way the arrow and background lags as you move is very annoying. Does anyone else have this problem? Is there a way to fix it?blettre
1,Bad Game,"I did not like this game at all. When you jump,the horse olmost falls over so the bots can get ahead of you. I spent my allowence on this game and was very dissapointed. Jumping is a goofy key and the box dose not even come with a manuel."
2,Difficult to install and operate,The steering is very difficult. It took us about 1/2 to figure out how to work. The manual with instructions is in a PDF on the CD.
5,I LOVE this product!,"I have been using Shikai Moisturizing Shower Gel (either the Cucumber Melon - my fav or the Japanese Citrus scent) for almost 10 years.This non-soap cleanser is AWESOME in the shower or as your primary face wash. It's so gentle - never leaves your skin feeling dry or taut. My son has very, very dry skin and this has helped tremendously.I highly recommend this product and often buy it as gifts for friends - who then go on to be as hooked on using it as I am.Enjoy!"
1,Deceptive Seller,"Misleading outright false advertising! It's not the product I'm upset with, it is the seller. I purchased Sandalwood/Amber and they sent me a standard Sandalwood. Even on the invoice it said ""Sandalwood Amber"" and features the old bottle. I would not have paid almost $5 shipping to get the present sandalwood incarnation that I could get at the store on my block. I bought this online and paid that much because I ordered and paid for a sandalwood/amber version that is not sold anymore in stores, of old stock. I'm angry. Covenant Health Products lies."
2,Amazing Singer....but...,"This was her first album...Two Too ManyYour Memory (Won't Let Go Of Me)Burnin' WheelThe Sweetest Love I Never KnewIt'll Be All RightDaddy's HandsMy Heart Holds OnThat's A Real Good WayHideaway HeartSomeone Carried YouI'm not sure why this shows different above what Amazon has. And the last few songsdoesn't really sound like her, so I'd be careful when buying this CD or MP3 songs.I'm only giving 2 stars for this 14 song track CD only for the few songs I do knowthat IS Holly Dunn. Even the Cover art is NOT the original Cover art, as you can seeI uploaded her original album cover."
2,Not the new Catch-22,"War, they say, is hell. But so too is writing a blackly comic novel about war in the shadow of Catch-22. Nam-A-Rama isn't subtle, it isn't sly, and it isn't as funny as it thinks it is. Can't hold a candle (or a phosphorus grenade) to Heller."
3,"wacky, funny","President Johnson (""Larry Bob"") orders two Marine chopper pilots, Almost-Captains Gearhardt and Armstrong, to fly to Hanoi where Jane Fonda (""Barbonella"") will parachute in naked from an Air America C-130. Together, they will meet with Ho Chi Minh and General Giap (""Hoche"" and ""Geepster"") to ""end the war.""Madcap dark comedy alternates between hilarity and grim realism. No structure that anyone could recognize, but some side-splitting dialogue.Exactly how this crew are to achieve the end of the war is vague. They are assisted by Gon Norea, a Panama-born Mexican who is a Cuban-Russian-British-American quadruple agent. On the way they must contend with vast forces who have much to lose if the war should end. Jane is induced to go by a promise that she can fire an anti-aircraft gun. All they know for sure is that if they fail, ""and should happen to live,"" they ""will be eating donkey dick on white bread in Leaveworth until the Sunday after the Second Coming.""Got the drift?"
1,A Teen's Guide to Christian Living,It doesn't seem to ring true....what is the story behind it??? Not a book I'd recommend for a daughter or granddaughter.
3,Stars not in top form,"These musicians I respect, but they are not in top form and they aremismatched as far as balance goes. It could be microphone placement,but Argerich is covering Ricci like a ceiling falling in. Ricci's alittle sloppy, so maybe that's why. I like both of these performers, but this disk is only for historical purposes in my collection. It lies mostlyunplayed. One has to remember, though, that this is live."
3,"Mostly Explains Football, Not How To Coach","This is an okay book, but the first half of this already thin ( about 120 pages 10""x7"") book is just about something most guys who watch or have played football will already know. How wide is the field? How long is it? What's an even versus an odd defense? And so on.The second half is very dilute, which is the real meat of coaching football. If you are an absolute novice, then buy this book. If you can get it free somewhere or very inexpensive, then it's worth a quick glance, but it is not a book you go back to over and over after the first reading, in my opinion.Good luck to you coaches ... and remember the priority:1. Children Safety2. Build character3. Win football games within spirit and letter of rules"
3,"Slow start, but builds speed","For a coach, the first 3 chapters were not needed. The rest of the book provided great insight and help with the game."
1,first time purchase,"I recently purched this book online. Something that I normally would not do, but decided what the heck. The book is a great addition to any beginning coaches library, The cost was cheap, shipping was more than the book. The real problem lies in the condition of the book. I realize that I bought a used book, but when the book arrived it was like someone had spilled coffee or somethig on it and most of the pages were stuck together on the outside egde. I just thik that if you are selling something it should be in reasonable condition. The consumer should not have to pry the pages apart.Coaching Youth Football (Baffled Parent's Guides)"
5,how the Scots made America,very informative. the contributions to the Scots in America are incredible . the leadership they provided helped shape this country and make it the greatest nation in the world.
2,"Thorough, but very negative writer","I enjoyed this book but was extremely disappointed by the pessimism displayed by the writer. While he was extremely thorough in his examination of the many great places and activities in Zambia, his writing failed to get me excited about my trip. In fact, it made me dread going. Fortunately, once I got here, I realized that Zambia is a WONDERFUL country and the negatives are few and farUnfortunately, there aren't that many alternatives out there for this book. I would recommend talking to people who have traveled there over purchasing this book. They can give you an accurate portrayal of what Zambia is really like. And trust me -- it is great."
3,Bradt Travel Guide Zambia,An informative and illustrative guide to watching exciting wildlife in Zambia and on the Zambezi river. Contains an overview for prime attractions as well as good advice for safari organising and accommodation.
2,Warning - specifications are WRONG - NOT SATA,"Even though the product specification indicates it will also convert a SATA drive into an external USB drive, that is not the case.This does not support SATA drives, only IDE drives."
2,it worked well for just 2 weeks!!!,"I used it for 2 weeks with a plextor dvd+-R/RW and it was working well, but then it did not work anymore, the problem was the AC Adapter, I searched for any kind of universal replacement AC adapter and I did not found it anywhere, because it is a special adapter (1700 mA) and the highest I found was 1200 mA but it did not worked.I sent an e-mail to the company (addonics) asking where to find the adapter, and they did not answered.I did not recommend this unit."
3,Very Cute!,"This was so cute, and my boyfriend loved it, however, it didn't taste as sweet as I had hoped it would."
4,Happiness is compelling,"I guess I am a fan of Berts , he has always seemed like this kind wanderer of the planet and its people. Here he turns his attention to the inside journey, the inside world and this time I felt even more captivated as he ineterviewed Prem Rawat. It is rare to hear people talk about life and happiness in such a straightforward way. Prem Rawat seemed really kind and so enthusiastic about every person discovering the happiness inside. I loved it."
1,Infomercial or interview?,"Interviews are meaningless unless they shed light on a subject. This interview does anything but. Consider the fact Prem Rawat asserts that he has some special gift for teaching people something deep and meaningful about life and that he's had this gift since he was a young boy. You'd expect any reasonable interview to seriously explore the obvious questions: what exactly is that gift? How did he get it? Just how special does that make him? And, my favorite, how do we know this isn't just another spiritual or religious con?Mr. Wolff never begins to approach these questions. Rather he simply acts as a smiling foil for Rawat to pitch his vague, nebulous product. It's also important to know that Mr. Wolff was paid by the Rawat organization to participate in this soft-hued infomercial. This isn't journalism and it's not a documentary. It's new age sales, that's all."
5,REFRESHING !,What a relief to hear someone talking about how we relate to life and our own personal experience of it. I found Burt's interview with Mr Rawat entertaining and intruiging. It ignited a quest in me to uncover and discover a deeper meaning to my day to day activities. This kind of content is a rarity to find. Something I feel that I as well as the worId could definitely benefit from hearing. I look forward to more inspirational interviews like this one. Thank you Mr Wolf and Mr Rawat for the uplifting subject matter.
3,a 60's cult,"A brilliant account of Roeg's films by the author of ""Elevator Music"". It takes a profound overview of an almost unknown filmmaker - a very cult one. Roeg's gems such as ""Performance"", ""Petulia"" and ""Walkabout"" are here criteriously analysed. Roeg is an authentic creator of surreal landscapes and plots, often mixing dreams and drug trips. If you're into mind-blowing stuff, that's well worth a look."
3,Acceptable,"When I saw the price, I knew that something must be wrong.. The problem turned out to be the frets.. It honestly looks like someone just eyeballed the spacing and slapped them on any old way.. However upon removing the frets, I found it to be a perfectly playable bundle of joy. I have really fallen in love with the banjo-y sort of sound, as well as the fact that it is really audible over the large group I use it in. I may fill in the fret slots and have someone cut me proper ones, but right now I am happy to play it fretless. Apart from the frets, the only other negative I can think of is the absolutely aweful plastic nut that snapped in half when I put new strings on it.. Just goes to show that you do get what you pay for but and with a little work, some pliers and a little patience as well as a new nut, you can have quite a distincitive, serviceable and tiny fretless mandolin.."
2,a major disappointment,"For starters, 'banjo cumbus' is a misnomer. The packing slip said, 'mandolin cumbus', and a mandolin it is. However, given the modest price and the fact that I do play the mandolin, I decided to keep it. The instrument arrived in one piece, but with the bridge misaligned. A luthier corrected the bridge position so that the open strings would tune. However, a second visit to the luthier was required to adjust the neck (easily done) and cut down the slots in the bridge before the instrument was at all playable. After all that work was done, the instrument is still nearly impossible to tune, or to keep in tune.That said, the instrument is loud enough that one should probably wear earplugs when playing it. Its voice is ill suited to Western music, though it is fretted for conventional Western music scales. If it could be tuned it would be suitable for Turkish, Greek, Arabic, or klezmer music, but little else. If you're looking for a banjolin, look elsewhere."
4,Just what my wife was looking for for work.,"I whinced while my wife took a knife to the box as she opened it and my wife cried after she found that she'd cut the gel pad. This was exactly what she wanted as a replacement to the one she has at work that has degraded beyond functionality. I've learned a long time ago that you never sink a sharp object into a box, but if you use one you lightly score what it is you're cutting, tape or cardboard. This was a painful lesson for my wife. Unfortunately she's had to use her brand new wrist pad repaired with duct tape."
3,Too expensive for what it does,"I like the wrist rest platform, it works well for me. I have an IKEA computer hutch, and the platform fits nicely on the keyboard tray. I don't use the adjustable feet, I keep the platform flat. The wrist rest is very firm, it doesn't really give at all. It may not work for those who would like or need a soft wrist rest. But the price is ridiculous, definitely not worth it. Unless it's dropped to around $25, I'd recommend shopping around for a different wrist rest platform."
2,Kind of bulky and uncomfortable.,"This just didn't do it for me. I found it really bulky. If you're using it in pullout keyboard drawer, it may not fit right. I didn't find it all that comfortable either. The gel pad wasn't cushy enough for me. I like one with more give to it. They might as well have used hard plastic.And for the money, I definitely don't endorse this product.Usually I'm really happy with 3M products, this one just seems like a waste of materials."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed and would advise many other (if not every other) release before this bootleg. Some of the tracks sound too fast, and the songs are all short versions. Its from the early years, probably 1972 but except for the setlist it sounds like pre-67 Dead almost to me. I didnt listen to it all closely though as I found the speed out of synch on some tracks, very mildly off, but off I feel. The sound quality is actually good, not counting the speed issue. Vendor that sold it to me for $17.00 was trustworthy and helpful."
2,Be careful before you buy Quickbooks,"Not a bad software, but the caveat is that you MUST pay every year to upgrade in case you are planning to get new TAX TABLES. After your software is only one year old, it WILL NOT run the new TAX TABLES. Believe it or not."
1,Crashes and data corruption are Intuit's Quickbooks & Quicken high points,Data is constantly corrupted causing Quickbooks 2006 to constantly and eventually crash on Macs. I recommend steering clear of all Intuit products until they manage to keep data integrity. Nothing like being unable to use your accounting software because it keeps crashing despit data verification and rebuilds. You have been warned. I wish I was.
1,thank you 'centuryvii' for your review,"I have been using version 5 for a couple of years now but would like the ability to download my bank statements since my banking institution is offering this for free for a year. However, after reading centuryvii's review I don't think I will be upgrading since Pro 6 doesn't offer this feature as well.I was on the phone for quite some time with QuickBooks/Intuit but never did get a straight answer to this question.I was hoping that downloading would be able as it is with Quicken but unfortunately..."
2,No to the payroll part of this software,"QuickBooks for Mac does a nice job in all respects except payroll. Do not buy this if you want to use the add on payroll software, TopPay by Aatrix. It has failed me miserably. Year end reports are incorrect and I have even had to resort to hand writing pay checks! Customer service can not be relied upon. I cannot stress how much time I have wasted trying to find and correct mistakes made in payroll. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO USE PAYROLL."
2,"Great Idea, Poorly Designed","This was a great idea, but very poorly designed. When I received this item I plugged it in and turned it on... The Turbulance lamp did nothing. Sure the light changed colors, but where was the turbulance? After about 10 minutes of waiting, the glitter finally settled enough for me to see what the problem was. The little spinning paddle that is supposed to stir up the glitter came loose during shipping, and after taking the bottom plate off I discovered there's NO way to fix it. The bottom plate allows you to change the lightbulb for the turbulance lamp (which is a pain) but there's no way to get into the globe to reattach the paddle. Stay away from this lamp, and instead go for the 'Fun & Functional Motion Lamp' because it's next to impossible to mess up a ""Lava"" Light"
3,20 min. workout worth purchase,Only like the 20 min. workout. The longer workout is boring and kind of redundant. Others may like the longer workout.
3,"Good rundown of the exercises, average workout","I believe this is the most famous name in the Pilates DVD business, but I'd say the workout is just okay. It's a rundown of a lot of exercises, but few reps, and not enough time to transition between exercises or rest for 10-15 seconds. This instructor is a bit kooky with her catch-phrases and the video appears to be more about her than about the exercises. To be honest, the yopilates instructor at my gym is way better than this. This video does not have as much emphasis on technique and breathing as the Stott DVDs. Having tried several DVDs, I'd say, skip the DVD and go to a class. You'll get a better workout. Really."
4,"Great workout, pretty intense",I like this workout because I really feel it working my abs. It's a good beginner's routine for pilates; the moves are easy to follow and become easier and more natural with a little practice. I have a hard time getting motivated though because the workout is pretty intense. It's challenging if you're not doing it consistently.
4,great workout,Just started doing pilates..have the Pink edition too..I really like that it gives you a whole body workout
2,Boooring,"First pilates dvd or workout that I've ever tried, the instructor talks too much and it didn't feel like much of a workout I prefer Crunch Super Slim Down. Better instructor and a moderate full body workout."
1,Didn't work,"I got a defective copy which didn't work half-way through, and it really looked like a pirated copy, kind of fuzzy. It was advertized as being sealed by the manufacturer, but the wrapper was broken."
2,For beginners only,"This video is great if you are new to pilates, but for everybody else it it just too much talk and too little exercise."
2,Do Not Buy If You Already Own Maximum Burn,"I was disappointed to learn that this DVD is almost an exact replica of the Winsor Pilates Maximum Burn series...but EASIER. I've been doing the Maximum Burn workout for years and was excited to see this newer version was available. There is nothing new about it (other than the new ""team"") and now that I opened the package, I can't return. It's a good workout, but only if it's your first time doing Winsor Pilates."
2,Doesn't live up to standards,"I have the first Winsor Pilates set from when Mari was selling through Gunthy-Riker; those are much, much better dvds than any of her new (and I have several of her more recent). This particular DVD is - just not challenging to someone who has been doing pilates for a while - there is also too much instruction (and and some funky, quirky moves leading to the next pose...) I received this DVD as a gift - did it for a month then went back to doing the original 20 minute workout and the 20 minute workout made me sore...after doing hour long ""Mari Winsor"" DVD for a month! Seems like this dvd is more about the spotlight for Mari. Go to Amazon and buy her old dvd sets if you can still get them - the results are faster and the production of the DVD is much better. Only buy this is you cannot get your hands on her old stuff!!!!"
4,mari winsor pilates,this was the first mari winsor video i tried. it was challenging and it works wonders. i do it on a daily basis and it still does some great work. i truly recommend this work out video. it is surely worth the purchase.
5,Wonderful film,"I watched this film originally on TV when it first came out (it was in two parts as I recall) and was very impressed....to the extent that I still remember it in detail to this day. (Actually at age 16 this might have been my first exposure to the Strauss waltz) It's a heartwarming story and the sound track, costumes, and sets are excellent. And wow, Senta Berger is just gorgeous!I doubt if this film will ever be reissued on DVD. However, if you google it there are some high quality transfers from VHS to DVD-R that are available from private sellers for about $10."
3,A good film - but a horrible print,"I've always enjoyed ""The Waltz King"" and had been looking forward to seeing it on DVD. Unfortunately, they used a very old and very red print for this release on the ""Generations"" label. It's really unfortunate that Disney didn't see fit to giving this film (taken from the two-part television episodes of 1963) the treatment it deserved. Some of the gowns and sets would have been beautiful if the colors had been restored - instead, everything looks like it was shot through rose-tinted glasses."
2,A few goods scenes buried within...,"There is shower scene with several women showering at once that is rather provocative, but the rest of the video seemed lacking. And by the way, Carmen Electra does not appear in the nude."
1,I prefer to see more action...,"i prefer to see more action and graphic scenes, rather than a story line which this video seems to portray. compared to all of the other great work PLayboy dishes out this is a let down from one of the worlds great and deeply loved among men companies."
1,Where's the action???,"I can't speak for everyone, but when I buy a video like this, I like to see actual sex scenes, not just foreplay...it is a huge disappointment. Carmen Electra is in one scene, but she isn't even naked, just a skimpy outfit. If you want quality adult entertainment, avoid this movie."
5,The Eating Disorder Solution,This book was very informative and educational. My knowledge of eating disorders has greatly improved after reading this book. Dr. Cole's book gave me understanding and hope about this complex problem. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about eating disorders.
4,"A great book, it gives the steps to get through.","I'm in a career planning class and this book is great; it providesexamples, tips, philosophical quotes, and more. It allows you toexplore what you desire to do, not the best-paying jobs or what isexpected of you. However, the appendices do not give much oncover letter samples. Of course, this book is not an all-in-onesolution. A class will give you more insight and structure to findinga career path and finding the means to accomplish it thoroughly.There are 4 parts in the book, which are all equally important:Introduction process theory and jargon; Self discovery andunderstanding; Test assessment , sources of information, values andgoals; and Career exploration and analysis. The best way to find thecareer for you is to try workshops or classes with books like this.This book is of superb help, but it takes the person reading it tomake the effort and go through all the processes to get aself-fulfilling career."
5,Great deal.,"Cheap price, and it works fine. What more can u ask for? Why pay double for the name brand, go generic. Save your money for once."
4,Battery for Minolta Dimage Camera,Works as well as any battery for this camera. Ritz delivered it quickly and as promised.
1,Run away from this refrigerator,"I can't believe it, but we are in need of a 3rd replacement on this particular refrigerator in less than 2 months. They have worked fine for a couple of weeks then the temperature cannont stay within a safe range even during 11pm-8am when no one is opening the door. I only write this review because I rely heavily on other people's experiences with products and feel that this model has a huge problem since we've had more than one fail so quickly."
3,not quite servicable.,The attached cover did not keep the matress in place. Sitting on the side of the bed was impossible. I sold it at a yard sale.
2,Unknown Puccini,"This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets."
4,Attachment Sports Finds a Voice,"As the director of the Attachment Living Institute(http://www.attachmentliving.bizland.com) we found that the ideas, programs, and principles of Susan Wilson's book, Sports Her Way, were entirely compatible with our mission. As the mother of a young boy, the information also works with him, so even if you are not the parents of a girl, you'll find this information to be rewarding, useful, and instructive."
5,Awesome TV Series!,"In my opinion, this is one of the best series on TV right now. The wife and I love it. It's a clever show, very entertaining and hilarious! The only thing I wish I had done, was to wait to get it on Blu-Ray."
4,Alaska Piks are GRREEAT1,"Have started finger picking and could not keep my finger nails long enough to do a decent job. I started getting Acrylic Nails but they were not reliable and they were bad for my health. Required redo two to four weeks. Nails would not grow underneath them. I tried the Alaska Pik, first the large ones, but found that I needed extra large for at least the middle finger and could use Large for index. They take a little getting use to and may require adjustment with a file or clip. But once you fit them, they work great."
5,Works very well.,"I study classical guitar, and broke fingernail in ring finger. I tried this item, and after some adjusting and a little getting used to, it worked just fine."
3,Is it stolen?,"It labeled at library use only, and another label HAWKEYE COMM COLLEGE LIBRARY !!!!But its in a good shape"
1,Man Out of Time,"A grown-up version of Holden Caulfield, but it was clear it was the author's first book. I kept reading, HOPING it would get better, but it never did. A good option if watching paint dry is the only other alternative. Luckily I got it at the library so only wasted time and not both time and $$$ on this piece of drivel."
2,Cheap,This item is cheap cheap not in price but in it's make up. Slips and slides around when using it.
2,Great Until Assebled,"The product recieved was defective. The pre-drilled holes were out of line. Once assembled, it was not level to the ground. It rocked significantly back and forth during use."
2,Better for arms then legs,"I was disappointed by this product. I wanted to use it for under my desk at work, but it was too high off the ground to fit under my desk. I thought I would use it for watching TV, but it jerks around too much to use effectively. However, when my husband broke his leg, he started using it with his arms to get some exercise in, and as long as he knelt over it, it seemed to work effectively. I wouldn't recommend, but I don't think it was a total failure"
5,Helpful,"I ordered this pedal exerciser to help with flexibility and strength in my leg after I broke my ankle (plate & 9 screws). I use it on a carpeted surface and it stays in place well. I like the adjustable tension on it - I can gradually increase it as needed. I don't think it is a big calorie burner, but if you are realistic in your expectations, this is a great product!"
5,great pedal bike,"I have been using this daily, well almost daily, ha, anyway, works great, very steady, tension adjustment works fine, great product and great price."
5,Good and reliable for the price. Space saver. Convenient. Good workout.,"Have had this product for about two weeks. Works well, reasonably quiet making only a soft whooshing sound in use, and sometimes a tiny and barely noticable squeak from a pedal. (This product beats the more expensive Kettler product hands down, which was extremely noisy.) It might not look like high technology, but it sure gets the job done. It doesn't take up much room. I use it for 30 minutes a day for my legs, and 10 minutes a day for my arms. Building up my time, but I've already been able to slip into my jeans with far less of a struggle since using this cycle and eating better quality (not less quantity) foods. I needed something that I would actually use and not get tired of - this is it. I can watch tv, listen to radio, or read a book while using it. What's not to like? Very nice. Thanks for a nice product."
3,Product good. Packaging horrible!,"I work in home health and frequently order these exercisers for my patients. I usually order a different brand of exerciser but due to the cost I decided to order this one. This was not one of my better decisions. The product is good. It is sturdy and has a good base, unlike some other ""cheaper"" versions. However, the packaging was horrible! I ordered 2 exercisers. Both were placed in a plastic bag loosely in a very large box. When I received the box, it was in very poor condition. I did not have a packing slip in the box and one of the tension knobs were missing. The other was found loose in the box, thank goodness. So I was able to salvage one of the two exercisers. I will NOT order these again. It is worth paying a few more dollars to get a product that I know will arrive in good condition."
2,Doesn't do what I expected,"I bought this pedal exerciser as a means of being able to exercise while playing on my computer. Here's what I don't like:- my knees hit the underside of my desk unless I move it to an awkward location- it CAN provide good resistance, but when it does the base tends to slide across the carpet and the tension thing gets VERY hot.So now it's collecting dust. It'll probably show up on Craigslist soon."
3,Good Idea But,"Wanted to use this while working at my desk. Unfortunately desk is too low so cannot cycle while working on computer. Also I can't lock the wheels on my chair, so I end up clinging to the desk when trying to pedal or risk becoming a projectile."
1,Disappointing,The bike like item was very disappointing. It moved around the floor. It was not heavy enough to stay in one place while peddling.
1,Not so good product,"I am not so satisfied with the product. Apparently you got what you paid for. In the first week, right side paddle fell off from the unit. I was thinking about returning it. But it was not with the effort. I will reorder another robust brand and model."
1,Aerobic Pedal Exerciser - Use for Arms & Legs,"Too bad! It doesn't work well! The bottom part doesn't stay on the ground, as soon as I started to pedal, the whole unit moves and lifts up along with my pedal motion. It is cheap, but useless."
4,"Um, it was.......","......Interesting! That's the word I was looking for. But, yes, it got a bit boring. I like a book so interesting, it's so hard to put it down, and once you've put it down, you want to read it over and over!"
5,This Was A Very Good Sabrina The Teen Witch Book!,Sabrina turns her rabbit's foot into a real lucky charm and with out reading the fine print. She now has a great big ounce of bad luck for every ounce of good luck. I don't want to give away the ending so happy reading.
5,Totally Awsome,I think that the book was really cool enough though no one could really make a lucky rabbits foot but i think fiction books like this are really neat. hope every one likes the book i really enjoyed it
5,pulley System,"[[ASIN:B0002DMK8K Over Door Exercise Pulley Set - Portable exercise device that helps strengthen upper body.Easy to assemble and exactly what I need. I fell on shoulder and required physical therapy, the therapist had me working a pulley system to be able to get my arm above my head. With this I will be able to continue with the therapy at home"
3,Audrey Auld again,"It's OK. Some songs were really good, some pretty slow. I like the upbeat stuff better. See the next review."
3,Americana - Aussie style!,"Australian Audrey Auld is back with a new record. This is her third release and as usual she has written most (11 of 13) songs herself. She also has Fred Eaglesmith, Mary Gauthier and Kieran Kane included on one track each. This CD isn't as traditional as her earlier releases, but I still find it OK. Instead this release is more influenced by Kasey Chambers' ""Barricades & Brickwalls"" release. The best songs here are the shuffle song ""Next Big Nothing"" (it alone is worth the entire price), ""B/Grade Affair"" (with Fred Eaglesmith) ,""Doin' Well"", ""Denied"", ""Not Who I Am"" and ""You Did"". This CD and all other Audrey Auld records can be bought here or at www.recklessrecords.com"
5,love this book,i remember when i got free when i bought putt putt saves the zoo. it was the best book ever
3,Sound quality issue,"The content of this DVD is very good but there is a problem with the sound quality. The volume varies throughout, do there's sometimes a sudden drop in volume."
4,Another great one! Challenging too!,"I have to say this is probably my new favorite of Leslie's DVDs. Her chatting isn't terribly annoying in this one, and you actually get a couple of miles with her alone. My only complaint is there is this girl in the second mile on the right of Leslie who just really irritates me!!! I have done the whole 5 miles though and they really fly by. I really do wish she would put some new/updated music on her new DVDs. But I really love this one! I highly recommend it to add to your collection."
4,5 Mile Fat burning Walk,"I have about 18 of Leslie Sansone's Walk at Home DVDs. I enjoy them a lot. This one is very good. I just got it so have only done it once, but it was a good fast 5 miles and I know it will be a go to when I want to do 5 miles. I liked the end where it shows a bit of information on each of the walkers.One of the things that I have noticed over the last year or so is how my posture has improved with Leslie's instruction for aligning your spine. I have never quite understood the pretending that there is a string being pulled from the top of your head, but Leslie's pulling the belly button in, stacking shoulders over hips, and retracting the shoulder blades has really help me to stand and walk tall."
5,Best Leslie Sansone Yet!,I have many of Leslie's walking DVDs and this one is the best one yet. She does chat quite a bit but that really doesn't bother me. I do agree that you loose a little speed between miles but I just keep up the pace from the prior mile. I love that the miles go so fast and that she does the 2 minute boosts to get your heart rate really pumping. You can do that or can maintain the the low impact way that the other girls show you. The miles go really fast and I really feel like I had a good workout. The full 5 miles takes only about an hour. I can find an hour in my day to get healthy! Try this DVD. I think that you will like it.
5,Great Workout!,"Another addition to my workout library. Energetic 5 mile aerobic walk that is partitioned in 1 mile segments. It was like an interval workout in that one peaks at the end of each mile, then starts the subsequent mile at a slightly lower pace, then peaking again. Liked it. A+"
3,for beginners,"This workout is for beginners. The first time I put it in, I did the whole 5 minutes. I did break a sweat and got a good workout but that is only because I added arms, hops, and weights into the workout on my own. I could tell during the first mile that it was going to be way too easy and I am not advanced by any means."
2,Disappointed in the CD Quality,I have several Leslie Sansone CDs. I'm disappointed in the quality of the CD. It's just not as good as the ones produced by Good Times in 2002 and 2003. I will still use it for workout variety. But I don't think I'll buy another recently made CD.
3,It was ok,"This work out was not quite what I was looking for. I found it very boring and ended up stopping it and finding something else. However, it is a great workout video and she is funny!"
3,Leslie Sansone,I love Leslie Sansone's work outs but I didn't like this one as much I still rate it up in the high 7.5
5,This is my Second Sansone Video,"About six months ago I bought Leslie's 4 Big Mile Walk video. I loved it from the first time I did it. It's fast enough to really be aerobic, but not so fast that I can't keep up. It's the perfect workout for me. I liked it so much that I recently purchased the 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk. Love it too! Can't say enough good things about it. It's basically the same moves, just more boosts so that you can get in 5 miles in one hour. So now I workout at a fitness center in the mornings and rotate the videos in the afternoons. Highly recommend them both!"
4,A good quick workout,"It's a great workout. With it broken up in to mile intervals and using different people with each mile, it seems to go by much faster."
5,WELL WORTH IT,"ANY ONE CAN DO THIS TAPE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO PICK AND CHOOSE YOUR PACE AND LEVEL, YOU CAN INCREASE AND DECREASE AS YOU FEEL FOR YOU AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU PICK YOU ARE ALWAYS BENEFITING. I LOVE THAT!"
5,Awesome,I received my DVD on Friday. I have done the completed between 4-5 miles each day. I think this is one of the best DVD purchases I've made. This won't be my last one. Thanks Leslie Sansone for a job well done.
5,fantastic,"I use to have to walk 3 miles to work, and 3 miles back. Walking back was up hill all the way. This is so very much the workout as walking that 6. You really feel the calories melt away. You feel renewed physically and very energetic. I have seen so many of my friends walk 3 miles a day and loose 40-60 lbs, just by walking. Walk is the way to loose weight and stay in great shape. We have lost the art of walking everywhere since cars came about. My daughter and I love this dvd."
5,Excellent CD,"Makes walking fun. Easy to use, just find a space in your house and go as far as you want. Nice to have a 15 minute, one mile walk before work."
5,Love Leslie,I think these tapes are wonderful-- really helps keep you on track in the winter and hot days in the summer.Big FAN
5,mrc526,"I just got this cd and its great, I love it. I do five miles as often as I can it makes me feel great. I like how you change from warm up to a higher workout and then the boost and cool down. I feel my clothing getting loser. for all people who want a good workout dvd this is it , if you stick to it and do this dvd you get results! Thank You Leslie Sansone"
5,Great video for everyone,Leslie Sansone has woderful videos. She is motivating and offers you a great way to get active again and at a pace you can handle.
4,2 Distracting people,"I like this DVD very much, I would have said I loved it, but for the 2 annoying people in it. The Cheerleader and the Sharkwoman. Cheerleader is very annoying, (could she possibly make her boobs bounce any harder?)but I just hang a towel over the right side of my TV screen and wha-la she is gone,,,,Sharkwoman in the back who at times makes me think that she is really hungry or something because I'm afraid at any minute she is going to start chewing the flesh on one of the ladies in front of her! I think she is just trying to show her energy in her smile? but it just looks Scary!But I think this is a good DVD, the music still stinks, but I have gotten use to Leslie's poor music choices by now."
2,Wish I could return it ...,"I have many Leslie Sansone DVDs and hoped this would be as good as the others. Unfortunately it is not. There is no warm up or cool down, and the ""miles"" are all stand alone. Each mile starts at a medium pace, speeds up, and goes to boosted (jogging) walking. The next mile starts all over again. Not good for a continuous heart rate/good workout. I wish I could return it ..."
4,Great Workout Except.....,"I did the 5 mile workout for the first time last night and wanted to give my review since it is still fresh in my mind. All I can say it was a Blast!! The 12 minute miles go really fast and I love the boost at the end.I have been doing the 3 Mile Advanced and 4 mile Super Challenge and the variations on the moves were exciting and challenging. My only complaint were the walkers. It was so hard to keep my eyes off Britney,she was very distracting. So uncoordinated and bouncing and wiggling all over the place. UGGH. And a couple of the walkers energy levels were very low (it seemed like Leslie just picked them off the street the same day! The faces screamed WHAT AM I GOIND HERE?? I was waiting for Elton or Carol to come in and walk circles around them. But all in all it was a very good work out and I am looking forward to doing it again tonite. GO LESLIE!!!!!!!"
3,Would have been 5 stars if not for a walker named Mickey.,"Been doing these walks for almost 6 years. This would have very easily been my favorite workout - if not for a walker called Mickey. She is such an annoying distraction; constantly talking and high fiving the other walkers, drawing attention to the fact that she is doing the boosted walk instead of staying low impact, and especially clapping for herself before and after each boost. I have gone so far as to place paper over her while I do the work out. I have NEVER had a complaint with any of the walkers in Leslie's workouts before this DVD. Such a shame because this would have been a great workout minus this walker."
5,Perfect for me,"I started off with Leslie's walking videos and this was perfect for the next step. It speeds up a little and adds more moves for an even better workout. I do her videos daily. I started out my goal this year at 500 miles but have already raised it to 1,000."
3,Walking off the pounds,"This DVD is fun, easy, and quick. I like the Walk Away the Pounds better, but this one is good too."
4,Great Long Workout!,I try to do this workout at least twice a week. This is great when you have a longer period to workout. To do the full 5 miles takes an hour but it doesn't seem that way. I really like how she divided the miles up. Every mile includes a different group or combination of people which keeps it interesting and also allows you to choose if you'd like your favorites. I enjoy the fact that there is boosted walking at the end of every mile. It gets your heartrate going! This is a great one to do for the aerobic benefit and weightloss because of the amount of miles.
4,Love Leslie!,This is a great dvd because you can pick how many miles you want to shoot for that day. Leslie keeps ya going and it goes by fast. I lost a lot of weight using many Leslie Sansone's dvds. Hope you have success too!
5,Efficient DVD workout,"I am a newcomer to Leslie Sansone's work, but I picked up this DVD when I was looking for a good at-home workout when snowy and inclement weather keeps me away from the gym. What I like about this DVD is the brisk, 12-minute ""miles"" with the optional higher-impact boost at the end. It's an efficient, safe workout. I also like Leslie's style -- she's chatty but not chirpy, has a positive, but not pushy approach, and she encourages viewers to be aware of and maintain good postural alignment. I can see why she is so popular, for while what she is doing technically isn't that novel, it's done in a way that isn't boring and her positive attitude is infectious."
4,One of My Favorites!,"I've been walking with Leslie for nearly two years now, and this 5 mile walk is defnitely one of the best I've seen from her. The workout itself is wonderful-- no extra equipment needed, just 71 minutes of straight cardio. There is no music-only option, but I don't mind her chatter here. The music changes from mile to mile, and the time goes by fairly quickly.The only real criticism is that odometer in the bottom corner. It keeps flipping back and forth between the current mile number, and a bunch of zeros. If it had the elapsed time, or time left in the mile, that would be different. I've learned to ignore it, but in the beginning it was kind of distracting.All in all, I can do this DVD again and again, and if you're already a fan of Leslie's, I don't think there's any reason you wouldn't like this work out :)"
2,not enough movement,I have a few of Leslie Sansone: Walk Away the Pounds dvd's. This is the worst. Even though it is a 5 mile walk the 4 mile and the 3 mile walk are much better. I do not like the constant stopping between each mile and changing of people between each mile. Not enough activity. I would have like to have seen the dvd before I purchased it.
5,One Of Leslie's Best....5 Mile Workout...,~I throughly enjoy this workout from start to finish. Along with *The 4 Mile Super Challenge* it is one of my favorites. Leslies and her *walkers* are positive and upbeat and so is the new music she features in this workout! I really sweat with this one! If you want a good workout and one that goes quickly..try this one! You will never be disappointed! Now go walk!~
2,Leslie Sansone's workout DVD,"I received the order promptly however the DVD wasn't of good quality. The sound comes and goes as I work out. I did not contact seller because I was already familiar with the steps for the workout therefore I did not need to hear the instructor, however listening to the music would have been O.K."
1,POOR production quality and horrendous music,"I can't believe I bought this newer video (the first one I bought was made 5 years earlier than this one) and the hokey, cheesy music is IDENTICAL!!! Literally unchanged in FIVE years?? I find it particularly aggravating that she can't manage to have the hokey electronic music match up with the mile segments. When she stands there walking and waiting to 'pick up the beat' and there's no music at all, what's up with that? I have literally DOZENS of other workout videos and I've never seen one with such low-quality production. I would never recommend these as the music, poor production quality and her annoying, perky commentary will drive you crazy after one or two workouts."
1,BORING...NOT A CHALLENGE...,"This was my first Leslie Sansone dvd...I bought it to use for a cardio workout..after my strenght training workout whenever I didnt want to be jumping around and out of breath like when I use other cardio dvd's.But this dvd actually lowered my heart rate instead of picking it up..I dont break a sweat and it's just plain boring because of much repetition of the same steps..you will be doing the same movements over and over again for the whole 5 miles. The only time you will break a sweat is on the BOOST WALK, but it only last 2 minutes for each mile....This dvd is good for older people who can do certain excersice moves...."
2,"great workout, cheaply produced just purchased in March & not working!","I purchased this dvd in March 2012. The workout is great but all of her dvds are so cheaply made that after a couple of viewings they stop working. The program just stops or jumps to a different part of the workout. I have five of her dvds some from Amazon and some from QVC, all of them stop working in less than a months time.Leslie Sansome would be wise to use better quality dvds to produce her workouts, even if they cost a little more. It is sad, as I get a really good sweat and increase my heartrate to a working aerobic level, gut the inability to complete a workout because of the poorly made dvd has forced me to stoo using her programs and to refuse to purchase any new ones.Please pass this information to Ms Sansome's production companyThank you"
3,Okay DVD!,"Leslie Sansone is a great instructor and first time I saw her was on Demand- Exercise TV. I like this DVD but I wish she has a section where it completes the entire 5 miles without stopping. I like that she encourages the audience to workout and also invited few of her regular 'walkers'. The result would be more effective if I have a hardwood floor. It is hard to exercise if you have a carpet. Anyway, I'll still use this regardless."
5,Very happy w/ product,This DVD is awesome. By the end of the 5 miles you know you have had a good workout and have burned some calories.
5,More energetic,"I have quite a few Leslie Sansone walking cds. I like this one the best because it's designed so that no matter how many miles you feel like doing, it will work. Each mile seems to require a little more effort (choice) the the previous cds. You can make it a good workout for You!"
5,One of my favorites,I love Leslie's workouts! They go so quickly and you don't even feel like you are working out. I could do this every day!
4,walk,"I use this DVD fairly regularly. I think it is a decent workout. I don't like high impact such as jumping jacks, etc so this is good and gives you a decent workout."
5,Love this one!,I really really enjoy this one. It is kind of a nice change of pace from some of the other ones. At the end of each mile is the boosted walking and you can decide which mile or how many you want to do. During the week I will do 4 of the miles due to time restrictions and then on the weekends will do all 5. I easily burn 500 calories doing the 5 mile. It is a great work out!
5,The best!,"I have a lot of Leslies dvd's but these one is so diferent. If you want to loose weight and have a great work out these is the one that you have to buy, you will have options can do 1, 2 ...4 or the complete 5 miles to burn fat and feel great."
3,Great for breaking a sweat,"I like that you can customize this workout and do as much or as little as you feel like doing on a given day. When I really want a challenge I do three miles and I feel like it's a really good cardio workout but much more fun than jogging on a treadmill. The only thing that bothered me was that Leslie likes to talk and laugh a lot, sometimes it gets annoying. This is a workout you can do everyday no matter what your schedule is."
5,As a couch potato....,"I own some of her videos, and this was the last one I tried, i dont't know why- perhaps seeing ""5-miles"" on it scared me a little....Anyway, I tried this and I have not used any of her other dvds since then!!! Ahhh..this is not only addicitive, it gets you going and feeling so good. I use it everyday except on weekends, doing 3 miles on it, and I spend 15 mins on the treadmill only on Saturdays. The boosting? I never thought I could jog before this dvd. Now I am starting to jog even on the treadmill on saturdays! The boosted walking segment has in fact become my favorite segment of each workout. Imagine me, a couch potato enjoying jogging? I now believe things can happen. I am not there yet with eating right but I am trying, this dvd however is a must if you enjoy exercising indoors. I am spending too much time on this review ain't I? I need to go do some Leslie videos...."
3,Christian based,"Did not realize before ordering that Leslie Sansone is a devout Christian and makes references to this in her DVDs. If this doesn't bother you, no problem. I found it not to my liking and will give the DVD to charity."
2,Mediocre,"I like Gary's music. I listen to most of his post seventies albums - the hard rockin' ones as well as bluesy ones. But this isn't the best of Gary's blues no way. Only one third of the tracks are bluesy and there's no Texas strut or his fine cover of As the years go passing by, to name a few. And the ballads... they are the worst part of Gary's catalogue in general.Stiry of the blues and Still got the blues are the exception, but mostly Gary sounds too sweet and slick. Get Out in the fields for example. It has the best numbers from here as well as morerocking ones. Or buy his studio albums from 1982 onward. Anz of them except for A different Beat, Dark dazs in paradise Scarsand Back to the blues will do (at lest somehat) better.So here's the list:Corridors of power 3.5 starsVictims of the future 4.5 starsRun for cover 4 starsAfter the war 4.5 starsWild frontierStill got the blues 4 starsAfter hours 3.5 starsBlues for Greeny 4 starsPower of the blues 5 starsDon't Buy this."
3,Decent collection-could've been better,"I have been listening to Gary Moore for several years. This isa decent collection of slower songs and some of his blues. The tracksthat are previously unreleased are a nice addition for acollector. However, I also own Still Got The Blues and After Hours andprefer those albums as they are versus the sampling here. Putting anedited version of a song on any disc is .... If you want to samplesome of Gary's faster and harder rock, I suggest the OUT IN THE FIELDScollection or trying to find THE EARLY YEARS collection which was putout by WTG records in 1991."
5,An amazing Album by the 2nd best guitarist on the world,"On this Album you can find the best ballads ever. Gary Moore has got such a great talent, his guitar-play, his voice, his lyrics...its perfect! There are many people in love out there, but only a few who really understand love, like him. Gary rocks! PS: I was listening to ""I'm always gonna love you"" when me and my first love went ""separate ways""..."
4,good but too much talking,"I recently purchased this item to go with my Multisport ENC 500 spin bike. This product is definately good for beginners like myself who need to learn the basic level of the spin program. It should have had however the option to switch of the talking as i really wanted to hear the music. Robert's continual ""yapping"" was what i think got me tired faster than expected (but i guess he had to). Nevertheless it's a good product...hope he makes one with a lot more challenges and louder music and alot less talking."
5,love it,Its the best tool i have in my tool box i reach for this thing all the time. I would recommend this to any one thats handy with tools
3,Pretty but ineffective,"The mold itself is lovely and would better place as a hanging kitchen ornament. The shortbread, stuck to the inside of the mold and the forms did not fully develop in the baking. I've made shortbread dozens of times in terracotta molds and each turned out with imprint and came out of the mold easily. I am disappointed."
3,for decoration only,"The mold is beautiful and makes a great display piece, but we never figured out how to actually mold our shortbread using the mold. It didn't come with instructions. We initially baked the shortbread in it, but that was next to impossible to remove. I then followed various instructions from the web for other molds, but it just never produced shortbread with any detectable design."
2,Very discordant modern arrangements of traditional music,"I bought this album having listened to only one song in which the acoustics and so on were very pleasant, and since I like to hear the differences in the reverberations of the cathedrals in which these songs are recorded, I thought this would add to the general richness of music available. The moderized arrangements, however, were so very weird, disruptive, cacaphonic, or conceptually (therefore musically and vocally) in an emotional and mental range alien to the text, the most of the album created a jangled and irritated experience."
3,"I like it, but...",Very glad to have it. But it is some expensive for what one might expect to pay for a book of this size and generally inexpensive type construction. This book will have to be handled very carefully for it to survive any amount of time.
5,Great New Book For The Young At Heart,"I had a chance to read this book when it was still in manuscript form. It's an excellent fast moving adventure story for any person that likes high adventure. The book is any easy read with outstanding pen and ink Illustrations. But it's the story line that stands out the best, as all the characters seem real with interesting personalities and with stories within stories. The book is void of sex and violence and instead uses themes such as courage, determination and triumph. I can highly recommend ""Dutch Clarke’s Journals"" as it's a story of love, redemption and survival.Also recommended: Book: The Call Of The WildVideo: Iron Will"
1,"If you love to drive, look elsewhere","This will be brief.Yes, I know it's really an unfinished work-in-progress. Doesn't matter.Even the full game, which I played for a few moments, is shamefully inaccurate. It fails to provide the sensation of speed. It has engine and collision sounds that are unimaginative or even silly.The developers say they spent $60M developing this version of the franchise? Somebody should have hired a real driver and asked him/her a few questions.If collisions that sound like plastic tubs getting whacked with a stick and FWD cars that OVERSTEER wildly is your thing, then by all means: buy it.Other folks should find another product."
3,"Pretty good, but less engaging than previous versions","I've played all versions of Gran Turismo and have very much enjoyed the improvements as the new versions came out. I miss being able to upgrade and customise each rides, What I also miss are the CARS! where are all the Toyotas? cars from the 80s and the 90s???????"
3,Great but leaves you wanting for more,"With only a couple of tracks, this gets boring after a while but there is nothing like it.. The handling is realistic and the visuals are spectacular... HD gaming at its best."
3,Not like the old Gran Turismo games.,"I recieved this game the other day and was so excited to get it open and play. The download was extremely long campared to recent games that had to download. The game itself is not what I expected from a Gran Turismo series. The graphics are great but the gameplay sucks. There is no damage to the vehicles. Which really takes away from the realism of racing. You can drive along the wall to go around corners. If I wanted to do that I would have stuck with Need for Speed games. If you hit another car it just bumps over. There are no upgrades in the game, you have to buy a car and drive it factory. That takes away from goals and the fun of fixing your car up.I don't know about this one. I like the graphics, I don't think anyone can complain about that. I just wish they would have kept the game for realistic. I guess I should return all this stuff and buy a Xbox360."
1,not so gran,"Having been an avid fan of gran turismo from the beginning, I have been progressively disappointed from the first to the last series of the game. The driving experience and graphics of GT5 are great but the individuality of the vehicles has vanished. On the latest version of GT you are forced into a more narrow racing platform which makes the game just plain boring. If you loved the original GT games, I dont think you will enjoy this version."
2,It's all true,"Everything the others say about this game is accurate. It is a driving simulator, your car never gets scratched, the AI in the game is lacking, etc. So, if you want a driving simulator, buy this game because it is fun to compare the cars on the race tracks. There is at least one race that seems impossible, and this impossible requirement brings the fun level down. i don't mind trying 20 times to win a race which requires me to really examine every turn, but forcing me to drive that Suzuki Cappuccino in a race against better cars starting from the 16th position - gimme a break. Challenging I don't mind. Next to Impossible is just too disappointing to be fun."
2,"Don't be fooled, it IS just a demo!","4 star average and a low price gold box deal usually equal a done deal for me. I bought this game the last time they had it on sale, and I feel like I was ripped off.The name made me a bit weary with ""Prologue"" but who really releases demos at full game price? I bought it thinking it would be a new, fun installment in the series with all of the other unlockable content and adjustability, but it is not!You can't switch from first person mode.You do not have even half the cars available.There are only a few tracks.The medal ceremony music is atrocious, and you cannot skip it.The load times between garage, dealership, and events are annoying.Don't buy it unless you are a collector and need this ridiculous fraction of a game."
2,Incomplete game = incomplte experience,Positives:Great graphics in solo play. Good sounds.Negatives:Online game-play is buggy and lags. Not many tracks. Difficult challenges need to be completed to have all options available.I liked Burnout Paradise a lot more for on-line playing.
5,Gran Turismo is the best racing simulator on the market,"This is an amazing sneak peak into what I will inevitably receive once I buy the full game. Some people didn't want to pay $40 for it, but the amazing physics and graphics, plus the in car camera mode make it completely worth it. Can't wait for the full game"
3,No Tweaking it's Arcade Mode only!,I bought this game with intentions of having an awesome time with it. Gran Turismo is fun mainly for the reason that you can upgrade your cars with different parts and such. This game allows you to do nothing but buy new cars. No tweaks to cars no changing cars up at all. To me this game is totally worthless. I gave it 3 stars because the graphics are outstanding but... Gran Turismo to me is swapping turbos/engines/tires/suspensions. This allows none of that. I wish i would have just waited for the full game.
4,Buen Producto,"Excelente producto, llego tal como esperaba, es un producto de muy buena calidad calidad y el envío fue rápido. Gracias por la atención"
4,Review,"It's a very great game just what I expected from GT5 prologue. The online is great but there is no lobby activity so if you want a game just to race this is it, hopefully GT5 will have more better online features."
3,After playing for several hours...,"You realize this game just isn't that great. It's good, but there are so many areas sacrificed just so the graphics look better. Come on; we need more tracks and car damage, which can no longer be ignored. They must be included. I most likely will not purchase the next GT... and I've purchased everyone to date."
4,Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,"As expected of Polyphony, the graphics and the game play is excellent. However, this is still the prologue so there is not much to do after the events are cleared. You can do time trials and play online, but online does not have as much players now so it may take several tries before having a race. If you don't have the game now, wait for the full game to come out in 2010 (hopefully)."
5,Great graphics and play!,Wonderful game. I love racing and the cars they picked for this game are amazing! The graphics are unbeatable. Definetly try it out if you love racing or cars. You wont be dissappionted.
2,Dont Belive The Hype,"Okay so this game is touted as the real driving simulator,Yet when I play most of the driving and cars seem unreal in the movements they make you cant flip the car or do a doughnut but almost all the cars spin out I use a g27 and the only thing the game seems to focus on is throttle control. Ive argued with countless people claiming these physics were real but yet for the gt demo and the full gt5 these physics were scraped nothing to real here compared to a sim this is arcade hell it even looks like an arcade game plus its boring no wonder Ive never been a part of the gt bandwagon ill just play lfs where i can do doughnuts burnouts brakestands clutch failure etc..... Dont buy if your looking for realism maybe the full gt5 wont be like this no matter how preety or how many cars they have if the cars handle like this ill be pissed"
3,Not as fun as I'd hoped,"Absolutely beautiful graphics, but overall it just wasn't that fun. I didn't like the new lay out of the game. I'm a huge GT fan and thought there would be more to this game. I realize it's just a prologue, but still it should have had more features. By now you'd think they would have been able to add a little damage to the cars."
3,Prologue disappointment,Money spent on Prologue was wasted as the game is very limited and is not much more than an extended demo as you are unable to upgrade or even purchase some of the better cars.
4,Gran Turismo 5 get's an A-,"Pro:Excellent GraphicsI like the jazz music.Con:You always have to start from last position. Why can't you do a trial run to see which pole position you would start in.You have to select a certain make car to enter the race. After you do that and start the race, there are other makes of cars racing against you. That's not fair.It's take forever for the winning dollar totals to add up when adding them to your winning account. You can show great graphics, but to add two numbers take an eternity.When I won the races and unlock the extra cars, they were added to the end of list of car manufactures. Why aren't they added in alphabetical order? I didn't even know they existed for the longest time."
4,Great game,"The greatest are the graphics and realism. The introduction video is awesome indeed.I would have liked the ""car damage"" feature included as in others racing games but I think this is something desired to make GT 5 more real but not really needed, IMO"
3,No Customization? WTF?,meh i'm glad this game didn't cost me very much it looks okay...plays okay...but I hope they put alot more in the full version otherwise this is epic fail.
3,Good,"My husband enjoys car racing games. This was one of the 1st ones he got for PS3. Good graphics, Thanks"
3,GT5,This game is not as fun as NFS Shift. It is hard to tell when the car is sliding. You can't hear the tires squeal very well because of the loud background music.
2,Gran Turismo 5,"Well, i thought gt5 no its the best game for the cars, its a to simple game, i thougth exist better car games than gt5 for example need for speed pro street, the music, cars sounds and others things are better than gt5 so depends of you like but my it doesent fine."
4,Great racing fun,"GT5:Prologue does a great jog whetting the racing enthusiasts' appetite in preparation for the full game release next year (hopefully). With unparalleled graphics, a wide variety of cars, and some very challenging courses, GT5:P will keep you busy and entertained. Buckle-up though, as this racing simulation will stress precision and accuracy at every turn.The best way to play is with a quality racing wheel. A regular controller does not do this game justice. I recommend the Logitech Pro GT, which was specifically designed for GT5:P. However, it has worked on nearly every PS3 racing game I've tried it with too.Overall, GT5:P may not be a ""full"" game and is not without some flaws (no car damage modeling for example). But for true racing game fans as well as those interested in trying out the genre, this game makes for an excellent buy for the racing simulation experience."
4,"Looks Unbelievable, Play is Pretty Good","As someone who purchased the PS3 mostly for the Blue-ray player and the features other than the gaming, I would say first off that the graphics are unreal compared to the Nintendo 64 (last video game I owned). That being said, this game is fun to play, but can be a bit frustrating at times. Some of the races are all but impossible to win, or to even finish in the top 3. I know I'm not an experienced ""gamer"" but for someone with fairly good hand-eye coordination, doesn't seem it should be that difficult."
4,Graphics are exceptional,Bought it for my two boys since they liked the Turismo series. Arcade play was lacking but the classic Turismo formula was excellent. Very realistic and great graphics. I liked MotorStorm: Pacific Rift better than GT5 Pro but only because the arcade style Motorstorm let me play head to head with my sons. You won't go wrong with either.
3,Not what I hoped it to be....,"The game is fun to play but it only has four tracks. WTF? the selection of cars is pretty good, but you can't modify them and when you want to race with a friend YOU CAN ONLY USE THE CAR YOU'VE PURCHASED! The people at gran turismo have really messed up on this one."
5,Most realistic yet,"This game follows the forward progress presented by the previous entry's in the franchise. It's the most realistic racer I've ever payed and that's saying quite a bit. The sheer realism adds so much depth to the game you really don't care about the minor drawbacks. There are around 80 cars in this game, but this time around they are all drastically different from one another. A ford mustang no longer corners almost exactly like a nissan altima. I've been playing this game with a standard controller but I highly recommend a racing wheel judging by the variance in turning that is possible. I took one star off from the fun rating because there is no car customization which was one of my favorite things about the previous Gran Turismo's. It's worth the money in any case and a must buy for a PS3 owner."
4,Best racing game thus far!,"I didn't originally want to purchase this game because of it basically just being a $[...] demo, but after I had rented it I just had to have it. I love the way the cars on GT5 move. It's an amazing game, both graphically and in gameplay. I would have to say that it is one of the best racing games I've played on PS3 or any console actually"
1,BAD,"too Bad game, no online service, it's diferent to final game, I don't recomend it,don't waste your time and money with this game."
3,fun game,"The game is fun and has really nice cars,and great graphics, but not being able to tune the cars is a real drag. it gets boring after awhile because all can do is ""try"" to beat your last lap time and save money for a new car only to do the same thing over. it gets boring after awhile. the prologue series are just boring, get the real version instead."
2,bad frame rate,"Occasional screen tearing due to slow frame rate. Game doesn't run smoothly as it should. Great picture otherwise. This game had potential, but fell short."
3,disappointing,this Game is Great.. but this version is real disappointing i bought it because i just bought PS3 and this was my only option or wait till march 31/2010 .. the graphic is great .. but NOT too many cars cars.. NO parts upgrade ( which i really liked )..
5,All 71 cars available,"For those who do not have the time to earn all the cars and tracks, visit gamefaqs. com and download the game save file. There you will find the save file which has all the cars, plus the F1 2007, and tracks. Great way to drive all the cars instantly and tracks if you just don't have the time to devote."
3,Forcing the wheel,"In Gran Turismo 4, using the controller was still a viable option - though a wheel was likely to improve your performance. In GT5 Prologue, using the controller is pretty much not recommended. I don't want to create a dang virtual reality zone in my house, I just want to sit down and play Gran Turismo when I have time. I resent being pushed into using a wheel. Guess GT4 is the last of the series for me :-([edit 11/25/12] Just a note now that the full version of GT5 has been out awhile. It still responds well to a normal dualshock3. What a relief, and GT5 is a great game in the full version. I guess I put too much stock in the prologue. It wasn't much of an indication of things to come."
5,Amazing Prologue for GT5...,"Beautiful Visuals?CheckFull HD at 60FPS?Check16 Player Online?CheckDamage?Uhh get back to me this fallNew Nissan GTR?Hell YEAH!!!GT5 Prologue is an amazing entry into the PS3 era by Polyphony Digital and a MUST buy for any Gran Turismo fan. The cars feel right and the AI is much improved, but not perfect yet. Some cars still follow a line and will not move. The new in-car models are gorgeous and extremely detailed. With over 60 cars and 5 tracks, Prologue is a great game.Sure many will say its a glorified demo not worth 40USD and for some that is true. It will not be worth it. But for car fans and especially GT fans you will not be disappointed. Sony has been proactive with updates for the game and it is possible that damage will be added this Fall.So the verdict? Buy it if you enjoyed GT1-GT4 stop reading and buy. See you on the London track m8s!!"
3,game review,i got the game faster then what they said and it was only labeled as good it looked new to me
3,just ok,"The graphics are great but the interaction with games is poor, also, I've been trying to set the time and date but is impossible."
1,EPIC fail,Received thus game for my niece she told me that it was not working it kept freezing up her system so I informed them about their defected game and they wanted me to take a gift from someone to return it so I went to GameSpot and got it way cheaper and working!!!!
1,Not the Gran Turismo you'll enjoy,"I used to have this game and was sorely disappointed with the inability to modify each of the cars. On top of that, there are only about 70 cars in the game and not nearly as many race tracks as there are in the actual Gran Turismo 5. My recommendation is to get the full GT5 ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BSA1C6?ie=UTF8&tag=ctraltcre-20 ) as there are over 1,000 cars that you can get and unsurmountable hours of gameplay."
3,Yep- Graphics and that's it,"I downloaded video before buying the game. I loved the graphics- they're amazing and worth getting the game for. For actual play, it's pretty sad. I started the career mode with a nice car and was doing great. However, certain races (that you need to finish to progress to the next level) require you to use specific crahppy cars such as honda. So I had to spend my prize money to buy a junk car that can't cut it in a school zone much less a race track. At that point, I stopped playing the game and haven't touched it in months."
4,like it...,Like the game...it's cool...buy this one as well...hehe my friend who's also using this product loves it. the product is awesome.
2,gameplay and graphics not good as i hoped,"graphic is so so. game play is so so too. game play gives you sense of dejavu on a lot of races. no progression to next class unless you finished all event which is ok, but there is always a special mission that block you from complete the event. for example, the famous B-6 that block player progression into next class is simply ridiculous. you simply don't throw this at the beginning/early of the game to block people."
3,Fun game but it has its flaws,This is a pretty fun game but does get boring kinda fast. Theres only a few different tracks to race on and you cant customize your cars at all. Theres also no damage which takes away from the realism. However the graphics are amazing and you can still have some fun with awesome cars.
4,fun,This is a fun game but it gets repetitive after a while. Some of the cars just ruin the game for me and makes me really want to stop playing. I am more of a person who likes shooting games but this was pretty good for a racing game.
5,"good game, very fast shipping","surprised by the fast shipping. took only 3 days to arrive with the standard shipping (expected 5-10 business days). great game, despite the fact that it's only a prologue."
4,No damage,"Ever since I've played the demo I was looking forward to this game, hoping that they would eventually add in a feature that would show realistic damage. The cars are beautiful, the backdrops for the tracks are breath taking and the handling of the cars are pretty good. The only thing that hurts the game in my opinion is when you smack into guardrails at 75+ mph and have zero damage done to your car. Or say you're driving and knock your opponent in the rear. You receive no damage, and it barely affects your driving.The tracks are pretty fun to play, and a little frustrating at times."
1,Not worth it,"I've been playing music and recording for over 30 years......I ran a test between the high dollar U87 and some very inexpensive mics from CAD / MXL and Audio Technica and there was next to no difference. There is a huge markup on this Mic and it is mainly from past nostalgia. Since then many of the same parts are used in a variety of Mics. I used a very inexpensive Audio Techica through an Alesis Firewire Mixer as a preamp and had excellent results. The Mic cost about 65.00 with a frequency response of 20 to 20khz which is completely in the human hearing range......I guess we can thank Mass production and the fact that many of these mics are made in China. Quality control is good, but to spend 3,000 and above for a condensor microphone these days is a waste of money period."
5,Excellent Book,I bought this book to help me with fiberglass work on my boat. I had already done some work to my boat with the help of a book by Don Casey (also an excellent source) but I figure you can't have too much good information on fiberglass work if you have a fiberglass sailboat. I found this book very informative and well-written. I learned some new things from the book and I recommend it.
4,ANOTHER DYNAMIC DUO,"Diehard comic book fans already know the special friendship between Green Lantern and Green Arrow. This book collects the stories which started it all. The book explores the social issues prevalent in the 60s and 70s, and demonstrates how these events bring the two (three, if you include Black Canary) to forge a frienship which still lasts, as is apparent in James Robinson's ""Cry for Justice"" JLA mini-series. Whether you read it for the purpose of nostalgia or just plain curiosity, Volume 1 of this two-volume series will not disappoint, especially with the exqusite artwork by Neal Adams."
2,WARNING! INCOMPLETE,"This movie had a wonderful musical score but unfortunately this CD does not have all tunes and melodies as heard during the movie. For instance, the music during the scene where Argyll upbraids Montrose during Montrose's card game and the music (two scenes later) where MacGregor arrives at Montrose's estate to inform Montrose of the lost/stolen money. Both were absent on this CD and those two were the main tunes for which I purchased the CD. If one watches the closing credits of the video it can readily be seen that several titles are not on this CD: ""Nutmeg and Ginger"", ""O'Sullivan's March"" and a few others.Does anyone out there know if there is a complete soundtrack to Rob Roy because to me this is not it. Too bad because this was a priceless musical score."
4,I like it,"I likeit, and why is there arequirement on the number of words you have to write for a review? I like it, and why is there arequirement on the number of words you have to write for a review?"
4,Burwell A Great Composer,"Listening to this music while watching the film, it sounds like a full symphony orchestra which matches trhe epic sweep of the story. But, somehow, in the translation to the sonic perfection of the CD, the same pieces come across as chamber pieces played by a much smaller orchestra. But that's a good thing! More intimate but still kicks butt! Listen to this and the Fargo soundtrack, and you've got a composer who does beautiful and very original stuff. Guys like John Williams, James Horner and Jerry Goldsmith sound positively lame compared to Burwell. Only complaint: too many reprises of the main theme; gets a bit repetitious. Still a must have!"
2,Burwell once again misses,"Carter Burwell's soundtrack music to ""Rob Roy"" was an early sign that he was not just getting it right. The score is all wrong but so is the movie. This movie needed an uplifting score. Carter Burwell could not deliver it."
2,Highly over rated album by buzzcocks masterminds,"Totally unlike the Buzzcocks, Pete Shelley solo work,or Howard Devotos post Buzzcocks work either. There are a few tracks of interest Til The Stars In His Eyes Are Dead"" rocks...Deeper"" is a nice moody track....and ""Can You See Me Shining"" has a good techno beat. On the other tracks I found ""gosh awful""lyrics and truly [weak] riffs..contained in songs going nowhere. I found ""Buzzkunst"" a sorry work by two rock and roll masters."
1,Maybe I just don't get it,"I LOVE The Buzzcocks--they are among my top five (or at very least 10) favorite bands of all time. And I love Howard Devoto, whose ""Jerky Versions of the Dream"" is one of my all-time favorite albums. Based on those facts and the reviews here, I bought this CD with high hopes and much excitement. But after several listens, I neither get it nor like it.Pete Shelley's involvement here appears to be minimal. And love Howard as I do--and willing as I am to follow him on his more experimental outings--this effort leaves me cold. Not a single song stands out, let alone gets stuck in your head.I expected pop candy. What I got was grating electronic jazz. Boring and frustrating--and ultimately, very forgettable."
4,A Strange and Wondrous Beast,"""Shelley"" is Pete Shelley, both solo artist and leader of the seminal punk outfit Buzzcocks; ""Devoto"" is Howard Devoto, co-founder of Buzzcocks before forming the influential postpunk Magazine. Buzzkunst is their first collaboration in twenty odd years, and a strange and wondrous beast it is. Pete Shelley is responsible mainly for music and effects, including the shimmering touches of electronica and short bursts of guitar. Howard Devoto, as always, is the mouthpiece, a blowhard who by turns you want to smack and then applaud. Highlights abound, especially the jaunty opener ""Can You See Me Shining?"", a shiny piece of new wave plastic, the thrashing ""'Til the Stars in His Eyes Are Dead"", and the haunting closer ""Going Off"". Welcome back, lads; next time, don't take so long."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR THE NOKIA 6010,"The Battery as it is shipped, and as it is labeled, DOES NOT FIT the NOKIA 6010 model. It is too thick and the back cover will not fit over it."
1,Did not fit,This battery does not fit the Nokia 6010. This battery is too thick. The phone cover will not fit over this battery.
1,Wrong size.,This battery is .4 inches thick and will not fit in the Nokia 6800 phone. Buy the 900mah that is .3 inches thick. It will fit.
1,Sanitized,"The author has sanitized and de-Judaized the legend. For example, he has changed the original inscription on the golem's forehead, a mystical Name of God that actually infuses life into the image, to ""emet,"" which means truth. A nice enough word, but hardly sufficient to breathe life into clay. The result is an OK children's story, but without the richness and meaning of the legend. Read I.B. Singer's version instead."
1,golem,"I was sucked in by the caldecott medal on the front of this book. The illustrations are great as well. Nevertheless, after reading the first couple of pages, I closed the book and refused to read more to my child. I did read it to myself later and believe that you would have to be mentally ill to write this sort of story for children. It is fine for adults, but this should in no way be considered a children's story. Shame on Caldecott! We will look more closely before picking their selections in the future."
3,It's for older kids....,"I was disappointed in this book. As a read-aloud, it lost my children's attention. The story and history required LOTS of explaining. Save this book for older children. My eleven-year old liked it. The younger ones were fidgetey and left before the story was over."
2,Not worth the $,We bought this last Christmas for my 4-yr old daughter and she played with it that week and hasn't touched it since. It really is just something else to sit around on the shelf in the toy room. Just doesn't grab her interest.
5,Neumann TLM193,"I have owned my Neumann TLM193 for a number of years now and it still works perfectly. I also have several other German and Austrian mics that still perform flawlessly. I recommend the Neumann shock mount, but the microphone is pretty well insulated on its own. Compare it to USA made Shure and EV top of the line mics, and all of my USA mics have had to be refoamed, and some have required new transducer elements. My old EV mics came with a lifetime warranty, which has proven to be totally useless in that EV won't honor their lifetime warranty (I even have the original receipts). So, in short, buy German and you get the best - best sound, best quality, best long life, and best value for the money spent."
1,Waste of money,"This feeder looks slick, appearing to be a good product. That's where the good ends.It is not easily filled, and the flared bottom means the sunflower seeds stack-up in the middle,once the feeder is half empty. Poor birds can NOT get to the seeds, and eventually give-up.Do yourself and the birds a favor, by purchasing only a vertical cylinder type. They arecheaper, fill easily, and feed the birds without issue ."
2,Caja China Not Squared,"Purchased a new Model 2 directly from the company. Shipped very quickly and all parts and instructions were nicely packaged. Everything was going well during the assembly until I noticed that the screws on the handle side of the box would not align with the sides. If I loosened the bottom section screws then side - end screws aligned but then there would be a gap on the bottom. If I tightened bottom then there would be a gap on the sides. Long story short...I had to re-drill slid frame holes to align with sides of box. Pain in the B*** but it looks like it will work. I'm on the west coast and this product came from Miami so I didn't even bother dealing with company being that I am a wood worker and have all the tools to make things fit. But if you are not a wood worker or handy-person, I would think twice about ordering this product until they work on their manufacturing quality control."
5,la caja china excelente!,"la caja china es un producto excelente, para cocinar cerdo, cordero y pavo.Es muy fácil de usar, y las instrucciones facilitan el empezar a usarla!!"
3,Bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift for my husbands birthday. He loves it, but be it known that it takes much longer to cook in it when it's cold outside. By the time my husband finished cooking his pig he was too drunk to eat it."
1,Dry,"Overall, the documentary was very dry and didnt provide good information. It was more about a vacation the ""dino hunter"" took rather than actual dinosaur findings. Very boring very dry, not worth 3$ even."
2,Buy ORGANIC and then NUKE it into OBLIVION,"I agree with the other reviewers who cite the authors' numerous contradictions and extraneous information, this book could have been improved with some judicious editing.There is one disturbing piece of advice in the book that I would like to draw attention to: the author continually recommends using a microwave to defrost and heat baby food. This is extremely counterproductive, why spend the time and money making organic baby food only to nuke it in the microwave and degrade the nutritional content? Microwaving breaks down the molecular structure of foods making them harder for your body to recognize and digest.No, microwaving isn't the greatest evil out there, but in a book devoted to nutritiously feeding your baby it seems quite conspicuous!"
2,"Poorly Organized, information is questionnable","I bought this book and borrowed ""Mommy Made and Daddy too"" from the library. After reading these two books, I wish I had done the opposite. ""Mommy Made and Daddy too"" is much better in terms of organization, easy referencing, easy to follow recipes, and most importantly, the reliability of the information. I am skeptical to Super Baby Food's recommendations on when to introduce certain food. To name a few, the author suggests to introduce yogurt made from cow's milk at 6 months, tofu at 7 months, ground nuts and seeds, wheat germs (?) at 8 months. I am a first time mom, but just using my common sense, I know it is not correct. The author doesn't seem to have much backup for her suggestions."
3,Not that great,"I was looking for ideas for my two year old twins as they transitioned from the stage of eating everything I gave them to the stage of throwing it on the floor in disgust. I thought this book would be really helpful but alas, it's very thick but has little that I want to use. Let me first say that I am very health conscious and very deliberate with what I'll put in my family's mouths. I buy the bare minimum of processed foods and stay far far away from everything soy related. I was very disappointed to see how many soy/tofu/vegetable oil meals there were in this book. Also, she almost completely ignores fats which is extremely hard for me to believe since proper neurological development and growth needs fat. Except for the garbanzo bean meatloaf & hummus recipe I found this book to be completely useless and ill-advised."
1,Did this book have an editor?,"This book is 300 pages too long because the author is very wordy and spends alot of time on irrelevant topics (e.g. arts and crafts), common sense advice, (e.g. put a drop cloth under the high chair) as well as numerous warnings about safety issues (e.g. be sure to read the high chair safety guidelines), not to mention the constant references to other portions of the book which makes reading this book PAINFULL. Next time the author revises the book she should also hire an editor. New moms do not have time for all of this useless info. As other reviewers have noted, I found the recommendation about starting dairy contrary to what I have read and heard from my pediatrician. I am committed to serving my baby organic, homemade baby food but am now looking for a book written by a nutrionist that properly incorporates meat and fish into the diet at the appropriate times."
2,Skeptical,"I bought this book because of all the reviews However, as I started reading the book I found that there are some things that the author says that are against what the american association of pediatrics recommends. -Feeding your child any nuts, cows milk are one of them. -The guideline for water is skewed too. It may have great recipes but one really needs to consult with their childrens doctor before following the advice given here. I checked with mine and she was shocked by the advice."
5,Very Comprehensive,"This book is intimidating at first, but definitely not bad once you get started. Follow the ""instructions"" in the beginning of the book so you do not get overwhelmed. I'm feeling pretty confident that I will be able to make some of my own baby food. There is A LOT of nutritional information and advice about keeping your baby healthy. Don't feel like you have to do everything the book says. While reading, just pay attention to what you think you can do and go from there."
3,"Great information, horribly organized","This book has a lot of helpful information for parents who choose to make their own food. I found the book very difficult to navigate and thought it didn't flow well. I definitely would recommend this book, but be warned that you'll have to jump around a bit. Hopefully future editions of this book will have better editors!"
3,"Working moms, pick & choose","This is a good book if you want to pick up some info on how to cook, freeze & serve sweet potatoes for your baby (as I'm currently doing at 6 monts, 2 weeks). However, there are large parts of this book that I just have to ignore. I can't serve new foods to my baby in the morning... I breast-feed at 6:30 am and take him to day care and that's that until I pick him up at 5. The best time for me to check for allergies is in the evening... contrary to this advice. The idea of me doing intricate crafts is annoying...even if I had the time, I don't have the skill or the interest.However, if you are a working mom who wants to make her baby's food, this is a good reference book. Please take it *ahem* with a grain of salt (the advice, not the baby's food).I'd also suggest you start baby with cereal, then veggies, then fruit (unlike this book's suggestions).jg"
1,Do NOT follow the advise of this book!,"OK. I admit it, I was a vegan for 9 years before I had my baby and had a mostly vegan pregnancy. I was intending to feed my baby a vegetarian diet. Well, my baby was allergic to eggs and dairy. That only left plant food for her to eat. She developed 'failure to thrive'. The only food that helped her gain weight, grow and become strong was meat. From that time on I too became a meat eater. Please do not believe the vegetarian/vegan hype like I did. Please feed your babies and children meat like our ancestors did throughout history. The idea that people are healthier as vegetarians or vegans is a modern day fairytale. Please check out the Weston A. Price Foundation for more information on this topic."
3,"Mostly good, but educate yourself r.e. food FIRST","I found this book mostly good, but its written in a very scatterbrained way. It constantly makes reference to other pages and chapters, lacking basic cohesion. Because of this it was difficult for me to read, and I had to read the book in its entirity before using its information. It also had some ideas different from mine, such as introducing nuts so early. On the other hand, it was indeed chock full of useful information, for instance, the author would gush about the endless uses of plastic bags (!). The best thing about the book was her Super Porridge recipe and we use it all the time, so that alone was worth the cost of the book to me. Overall, I agree with other reviewers that a slightly less superior attitude, more organization, a discussion r.e. obviously controversial food intruductions in the appropriate areas, and less overall wordiness would make this book more of a stand out."
4,informative guide to make natural baby food,I liked the section of what ages the baby can start eating foods and it gives you ideas and recipes to use home grown products.
5,Great natural baby food,My wife loves this book! She consults it for every meal. She uses a lot of organic fruits and vegetables which makes the meals even healthier. You definitely have to get this book if you have a little one!
2,Difficult to navigate,"I found this book to be really preachy about your family's food lifestyle as a whole, and the book is not well organized. There are a few good recipes and ideas, but it's hard to go back and find them later. I had a hard time using this book to my advantage."
5,A perfect book to help start your little one on solids,"This book is excellent. Starting a tot on solids can be overwhelming, but this book really clears up questions and doubts. It has a wonderful break down of what to start when, schedules for feeding, and great recipes. This is the book any health conscious parent needs. It even has great recipes for homemade baby wipes and other necessities. When it's time to start feeding your baby something besides breastmilk or formula, this book will help you know whether to give him/her bananas or broccoli! All parents need this book!"
3,lots of good information,"i thought this book had lots of good information, but presented haphazardly. lots and lots of money-saving tips, but so many that a particular one read earlier is hard to find when using the book as a reference. recommend using a highlighter pen or post-it notes."
2,Too Preachy,"I know eveyone raves about this book but I found her style to be too preachy for me to tolerate. Endless diatribes about the evils of white flour & premade foods really got on my nerves. Plus I don't have a natural food store anywhere near me which makes buying dessicated liver powder & agar agar a bit of a challenge. While I do believe my child needs a good start in life and can do without artifical sweetners, perservatives, etc I think this book goes a bit overboard with it's agenda."
3,Yaron needs an editor,"I am really surprised that so little editing seems to have been done to this book. There is some really great information in here, but it is surprisingly disorganized.Also, this book really focuses on raising your child a vegetarian. For serving meat to children you will probably have to turn to another resource."
1,This Book Has Got To Be Kidding,"This is a book for those who found What To Expect When You're Expecting's ""Best Odds Diet"" and What To Eat When You're Expecting too lax. No child I've ever met eats this way. (And yes, I know lots of veggetarian, organic babies.)Recommending *dessicated liver powder* for those of us who think babies should have some meat? Brewer's yeast for infants? Please! I'd never get my baby to trust another spoonful of anything again if I gave him this. Kelp?This book is impossible, laughable, and downright stupid, according to my pediatrician. Do not bother buying it. Check it out of the library if you need a laugh, but don't waste the money."
1,Poorly written and overly hyped,"I was extremely disappointed with this book and returned it for a refund. It is poorly written and disorganized. The book is also replete with typographical errors. It lacks essential information on nutritional values of various foods (e.g. I wanted to know the nutritional value of strawberries and the book failed to provide it). The recipes are also lame and are all vegetarian. And why would a baby food book contain chapters on homemade baby products and household cleaning products? I discovered that Ruth Yaron is neither a nutritionist nor a pediatrician. This book was written solely on her experience as a mom and what she fed HER three children. Essentially, this book is a collection of useless and self-promoting information. I suggest that you review Annabel Karmel's ""First Meals,"" the real source for homemade baby food!"
2,Unorganized,"I am not too fond of this book. It is very confusing (and I am a very well-educated person). You end up doing a lot of flipping around. It seems that every paragraph refers you to another page for complete information. Also, it is very overwhelming for those who are just starting to prepare their baby's food. The complete recommended diet is very complicated, with each meal including more ingredients than most people use in meals prepared for adults. Also, my pediatrician recommended that I not offer several foods that are recommended in this book until a much older age. I would prefer that the book have references to support the use of some of the supplements, as well. Overall, this book discouraged me from preparing my baby's food, as I found it overwhelming, confusing and complicated. Now I only use it occasionally to look up how to prepare specific foods."
1,difficult to follow,"Poorly written, even the recipes are littered with unrelated ""tips"" making them difficult to follow at times. I'm I busy mom, I need something concise and to the point."
2,Misinformation,"As many have stated in other review this book contains some dangerous misinformation. But please don't be alarmed by all those stating that carrots and other vegetables can be high in nitrates when processed in the home. According the american association of pediatricians that's only an issue at less than 3 mos (not a time for solid food) [...] and the Mayo Clinic states not before 4mos. After this point infants possess the digestive tools to process the nitrates, in broccoli, spinach kale and other veggies."
2,Overzealous attempt at guide for feeding your baby,"This book is annoying to read -- way too many superlatives to describe everything (super this and super that...). Aside from the style, the book is not a practical guide for someone who is interested in feeding their baby nutritious foods but who also has other responsibilities (job, etc.). Some of the food suggestions are amazing - I wouldn't eat them, so why would I feed it to my baby! Why can't anyone write something that offers practical guidelines on what to feed your baby/toddler?"
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT!,"My sister told me about this book, and we both bought it. I for one have learned so much from it. I have ear-marked nearly every other page! I have a 6 month old son, and I thought that making baby food would be difficult, but it's not! It's actually fun. And inexpensive. I especially like the index in the back of the book that lists all the different types of fruits/vegetables, and at what age your baby can eat them, how to prepare them, etc. And, Ruth gives great tips on how to freeze and store home made baby food. I'm so glad I got this book, I'm proud to make food for my boy!"
2,Save Your Money,"After buying this book and reading most of it, I have shelved it. While there is good information in it, it could be about 300 pages shorter. Also, many of the suggestions and recipes are biased based on a vegetarian point of view. If you're looking to make your own baby food and would like something more concise, I have found that www.wholesomebabyfood.com is a great resource."
1,Insulting to my intelligence,"Difficult book to read due to all the REMINDERs, TIPs, and WARNINGs scattered on nearly ever page. Most of the tips are common sense, as are the reminders. The Super Porridge sounds like something I'll use, but it takes up all of four pages.The rest of the book? Waste of time. It's not even about baby food."
1,Do not buy this book,"Someone who buys this book based on the front & back covers will be unpleasantly surprised to find out that this is a vegetarian book. First of all, I NEVER intended to put my baby on a vegetarian diet so I felt very misled. In fact, I love meat and her chapter on meat was not only offensive but also ridiculous and totally misinformed. You wonder how someone so stupid was ever allowed to publish a book that deals with babies' health.Even if you are a vegetarian, I would think three times before buying this book because the author's only qualifications are her healthy twins and how they never got sick.To top it all, the tone of the book is VERY annoying and preachy, so much so that I'm here warning all mothers not to waste their very limited and valuable time and money with this horrible book."
1,not user friendly,"I borrowed this book from my local library, boy am I glad I didn't buy it. It is possibly the least user friendly book I have seen! I never did read the whole thing it was so dry. I'm sure some of her recipes and recommendations are good, but truthfully you could probably get the same from a different book. I'll be using someone else's book to feed my super baby."
1,Not recommended,"I do not recommend this book. I completely (and stupidly) trusted the author and gave my daughter nut butter at 12 month old. She had an anaphylactic reaction. The author also recommends feeding 6 month olds egg yolk. I did so at 12 month. My daughter is also allergic to egg at 18 month. It is impossibe to completely separate yolk from the white, which is very allergenic. After learning a lot about food allergies, I would never, never recommend this book to my friends who are having babies soon."
1,"Lots of personal opinion, little scientific basis","To read this book, you'd think that parents are simply not feeding their babies properly -- and that's just wrong! I can't even believe some of the things this book says your baby should be eating -- like brewers yeast and dessicated liver (ugh!)! Plus, the author plops down a good healthy dose of her own personal opinions about things, which don't lend much creedence to what little sound advice there might be. I agree with some of the other reviewers -- I don't know where all the stars for good ratings come from!"
2,Too sectarian,"Though this book gives a lot of very helpful information, it is way too vegetarian oriented. As a non vegetarian person, I could not find any regular menu with meat apart on 2 special pages dedicated to meat-eaters... Besides that, I do not like very much Ruth's very self-contented style."
5,brilliant!!!,I absolutely LOVE this book. It has so much useful information and I will definitely use it for all my children and as often as possible!!
1,Who is this lady?,Ruth Yaron isn't a doctor. This is painfully obvious by the way she recommends peanut butter at 10 months. The tone is condescending. There are several better books. Be sure to check the credentials before you buy the book!
3,the writer is totally off the wall!,"I enjoyed the book but it definitely has a few drawbacks. Some of the things she recommends are not good. She has no degree as a doctor or dietian. However, her monthly chapter on what they should eat and how much is helpful to compare with other books on the similar topic. Her money saving tips are hilarous!So common sense the tips shouldn't be in the book, slimming the book down to a better size! And she's very preachy. Buy it as another resource, if you have the extra money, but I wouldn't use it as my only resource."
2,This book could make you crazy!,"I borrowed this book from a friend and found it not an easy read. With a baby and little time to read efficient writing is best. I found some good information in the book but thought the author went a bit over the edge and could really scare people with her rantings about pesticides and other deadly lurkings in our food. I also found it interesting that the author had no medical personnel help with the writing of the book, only a nutritionist from a .com. For now I will continue to look for a simple, well written, non-scare tactic book to make my child healthy meals."
2,Some Useful Information but WAY Too Preachy,"I bought this book looking for some cheap, healthy babyfood recipes. Well to get to those you have to wade through pages upon pages of the author's diatribes against the food industry. The author implies that if you feed your family animal products (aside from eggs & dairy) or non-organic food you are in effect poisoning them. Not everybody can afford to pay 5x as much for organic and there is plenty of nutrition in lean meat, poultry, & fish. Pass on this and check out ""First Meals"" instead."
2,super baby book,"This book is for VEGETARIANS. I had no idea when I bought this book. I noticed it when I was looking for some meat recipes. The author clearly says that ""Meat is not a part of the Super Baby Food diet""in the meat section. This book should be titled ""Super VEGETARIAN Baby Food"". I think the amount of formula per day she recommends is too strict for non-vegetarians. In fact, my pediatrician recommended less amount than that. If you are not a vegetarian, you had better read other books, too. These recipes other than meat are good."
5,Opened up my eyes to the natural way,This book definetely opened up my eyes to doing things naturally and made me feel more comfortable to do so and give my baby the best I can. I recommend this book to others ever since I bought it and hope that other will have an open mind and just get to know what this book is all about because giving your children the best is really something important. After all would you eat TV dinners everyday? if not then why should you make your children eat ready prepared foods? ENJOY ! PS The author also responds to emails very quickly and is very helpful !
4,Makes making your own baby food very easy,"I was not the type to make my own food, let alone my baby's food. My daughter has some food allergies which made me want to prepare her food so that I knew exactly what she was getting. This book explains everything very clearly so that even I could easily follow and make food. I never imagined how satisfying it would be to make her food. She like the food better than the baby jar food and I feel more secure in what I feed her. There is even information about food allergies in the book that was very helpful. I would highly recommend this book- my baby and I have both benefitted from it!"
1,Too Much Information,"Searching for a recipe book on making healthy, natural baby food, I was recommended the book ""Super Baby Food."" I borrowed the book from the local library before purchasing and I am glad that I did. The book is exhaustive in detail and although I am sure it was well intended, I did find it unnecessary. With time on short supply, all I wanted was the recipe. I found everything I was looking for in the book Simply Natural Baby Food by Cathe Olson."
3,informative but cultish,"I picked up this book after seeing it reccommended in many venues. I agree with other reviewers that it is oozing with extraneous information. The author clearly beleives she is doing a great service by disseminating her choices in dishware, home-made Christmas crafts, and kitchen storage techniques. While others seem to feel angered by her diatribes, I think I had a few good laughs the first -and only- time I read some of her suggestions (such as saving money by storing your food in ice cube trays left to right, so that if you don't fill them up you'll use 3 inches less of tin foil). My biggest uses were to know, generally, which foods to introduce when, and how to prepare them for a baby's ingestion (steam, bake, blend, peel, etc). Good to have on your shelf but don't get sucked in. Another great and SIMPLE book on the same subject is ""Into the mouths of babes."""
3,Creative ways to get vegetables eaten!!,"Before parenthood, I can't say I was the healthiest of eaters. However, recognizing the rising incidence of obesity in the US, I am determined to create a balanced eater in my son.I liked this book because it explains how to prepare (for a baby) just about every vegetable ever grown. Also, it gave me some ideas that I would have never thought of....such as adding avocado and kale to porridge (in my case, baby oatmeal--I couldn't fathom grinding). Sounds gross, but my son LOVES it, and I feel good that he (now in an extremely picky stage) will eat it. Using this book helped me figure out how to introduce vegetables into all of our diets.There are typos, some inaccuracies, and she does go off on tangents. But the reference (food by month, and vegetables by name) and recipe sections are great. As with anything, use common sense."
1,Very disappointed with this book...,"I bought this book hoping it would give me some insight on how to make my own baby food. I am a beginner, and thought this book was for beginners.I was very disappointed in it. It gives a lot of information that conflicted with other nutritional info. given to me by my doctor. It is filled with little hints and ideas that are common sense (unload the top rack of the dishwasher first so that wet dishes don't drip onto the bottom rack???). By the time I read through all the useless ""hints"" and got to the real info I was frustrated to find that the recipies are not easy to follow. Many of them have strange ingredients in them that I would have a hard time finding in my grocery store.Overall, this book was a waste of money. I purchased ""Mommy Made and Daddy Too"" by Martha Kimmel and learned 10X more that I did from this book."
2,Misleading blend of fact and fiction,"Ms. Yaron has done the reader a disservice. In some areas of her book she really did her homework (for example: nutrition). But assuming all her assertions are based on research and backed by studies is a mistake. Commercial baby food isn't evil. It is subjected to strict standards and guidelines and is safe and convient. It may be pricey, but worth the price when circumstances dictate. Homemade baby food will save money, but it really is a judgement call. Her section on cleaning products was the most disturbing. While calling parents to remove all ""toxins"" from their homes, she overlooked the fact that several of the cleaners she recommended using (Borax and washing soda) are poisonous. Soap is made from lye(caustic), but many detergents are very gentle. Be careful to verify the facts. Use her recipes, save money and take it all with a grain of salt."
3,some good advice but use your own common sense,"There are some good ideas in this book to consider. However, I cannot stress enough to do NOTHING without first talking with your baby's doctor. I went ahead with some of the food recommendations for a baby's certain age given in the book and almost ended up with a disaster. I gave my child egg at 10 1/2 months and she wound up in the emergency room with severe anaphylaxis. The doctor said this should never have been tried until at the least 15 months. He also said never give a child peanuts or anything with peanuts in it until at least 3 years of age. He also said I very likely sensitized my child to eggs for life because of introducing it too early. I know the author warns of food allergies in very fine print, but please discuss with your doctor the foods she lists in the boxes ""INTRODUCE THESE FOODS TO YOUR (xyz)MONTH OLD"" first."
2,Tree-huggers dream...,"I did not want my son to be on a wheat-germ and nature store diet. I want him to have homemade food that is something that will not make his system reject a typical, healthy diet when he is older. I thought this book had too many ""specialized"" requirements for such a young little person. I would recommend Anabel Karmel's First Meals if you are interested in making your little one's food. I love that book!"
4,Super Baby Food is super info,"I haven't had the time to read it through yet. But so far it's got the level to details that I want to follow. Still a bit intimidated, but am taking baby steps (ie, clearing out space in my freezer for the ice cube trays for freezing baby food) to do this for my baby."
3,"Good, but incomplete","My kids eat a lot of the recipes from this book, and I use a lot of the cleaning ideas. This book would be so much better if the author set aside her personal feelings (the ones about meat get really annoying) and tried to be more comprehensive. My kids are sensitive to dairy and could never eat the way Ms. Yaron suggests. At least the second edition includes some meat recipes. Cookbooks should TEACH about food, not PREACH!"
2,"Good basic guidelines, but too many extras","Frankly, I've been very frustrated with this book. The author uses a lot of cross-referencing, and what little organization there is tends to be very user-unfriendly. Plus the recipe section is cramped and difficult to follow. I found the information I was looking for -- a food introduction timeline for my 6-month old, as well as an alphabetical index of how to purchase, prepare and freeze a number of fruits and vegetables -- but I definitely don't care for the tips on frugal and eco-friendly gift giving and household cleaning. I'm pro- frugality and pro-environment, but what's that got to do with baby food? I'm also concerned about all the supplements the author endorses for babies. Although her suggested servings seem reasonable, the author is not a nutritionist (nor does she claim to be), and some supplements can be toxic in incorrect doses."
2,Missleading,"It should say it is for vegetarians, clearly on the cover! It is not very useful until your baby reaches 6 months and on top of that it doesn't cover how to include meat and fish in your baby's diet. Had I known this I would not have purchased it. The only good information I got from it was the ice cube tray method for freezing baby food. Also, it is very confusing and lacks logical organization of the chapters."
3,"Difficult to read, but comprehensive","I think you have to read this book several times in order to really understand it. It is incredibly long, incredibly complicated, in a small font, and not very linear. Also, I think it could make parents feel concerned about the health of their babies if they don't follow it perfectly. It makes feeding one's baby into a mammoth task! On the plus side, it has a lot of great suggestions that lots of my friends didn't know: info about food enhancers, the safe ages to introduce food to your baby, etc. I think that a lot of the recipes are for people who have nothing else to do but cook for their babies, but the food storage information is excellent. I would agree with the review that is concerned about the author's qualifications. I reviewed ALL of the advice I found pertinent with our pediatrician, who actually disagreed with a decent portion of it."
1,She is not a medical doctor,"I agree with the premise of feeding the baby organic food and that making food from home is worth the time. Like others, I found her writing style disorganized. But it wasn't the layout of the book that is as bothersome as the author's credentials, or should I say lack of credentials. I thumbed through the book to find out that she did a lot of research on the subject matter. Personally, I find that frightening, she is lending her opinion and it isn't a medically backed one. What did she research, was the research written by others not in the medical field..........she can't back what she writes."
5,Great Info!,"Great book!! Lots of good information. A must have!! Especially for first time moms! This is a guideline to feeding your baby when you don't have anything else to go on. They don't come with owner's manuals, you know!Includes everything you need to know on nutrition, first foods, healthy recipes and alot of added extras. I couldn't have done it without this excellent resource! I can say my baby is eating healthy! Two thumbs up!!"
3,Not Essential,"This woman is a nut bar. To say she over does it on safety warnings and savings tips is a huge understatement. (For example, her suggestion for a final step of clean-up of broken glass is to walk over the area in your bare feet - better your feet than your baby's, sure, but really? And why is this even in a book about food?) If you are not sure how to pick out good produce and/or have limited experience with fruit/veggies beyond the typical apples & pears and potatoes & carrots, then this book can be helpful. I also bought ""Cooking for Baby"" by Lisa Barnes, and think this would be more than sufficient as my only book on this topic."
2,Healthfood oriented...fewer recipes than I expected,"If you're an earth mother, you'll love this book. If you're not looking to sneak wheat germ and seeds into your child's meals, pass on this book for recipes. But on the bright side, there's lots of info on hygiene, food health and preparation hints. She goes a little overboard on cost saving hints. Like who's going to ""go in with a friend"" to buy the $5.00 baby-sized blender attachment just because the company only sells in sets of two?"
3,Comprehensive--to a fault,"While this book is the best guide I have found so far for introducing solids and preparing homemade baby food, it is cluttered with ridiculous, unnecessary tips. An example: When lifting the lid to cook rice cereal, hold the lid over the pot so the condensation doesn't drip on the stove. These inane suggestions and the cloying commentary (including the smiley-face-as-punctuation-mark)distract from the real information. Where are the editors? This could be trimmed to an extremely useful 25% of its current size."
2,Not user friendly,This is a great book if you have hours on end to sit down and read the small print. The pix are black and white...the information is overly in depth. I don't want to have to cram for my baby's nutrition exam...I just want to feed him healthy food that will benifit him in the future. The book is more like the encyclopedia of how to make baby food.It is not all bad...go to a bookstore and thumb through it before you order.
2,No so exciting really,"the ideas in this book are not as amazing as the write ups make it seem. so, make real oatmeal for your baby instead of the powdered instant mush, and mash your own banana. honestly, all the time savings tips were for us a big hassle. all we do (and i highly suggest this for your baby too) is take whatever our meal is and either mash it with a fork or put it in the baby food blender (or food processor would work too) and voila! super baby food. mix in a little plain yogurt if it is too thick (like chicken or beef when ground after cooking it can be dry) -- it's really no big deal. our 9 month old has had jarred baby food i think 4 times - when we were on the road or the day was just too busy etc. good luck."
2,baby won't eat most things but good reference source,"I got this book thinking this would be a good alternative or a supplement to jar food. The baby won't eat ANY of the ""supergrains,"" purees or meals made according to the recommendations. This continued throught her first year.However, there are useful tips on the amounts of various foods the baby should be eating and also helpful tables on nutritional values. I learned to make home-made yogurt from this book. The best part: the book is organized with a busy mom in mind.Bottom line: it is SOMEWHAT USEFUL but not the ""bible"" it professes to be."
2,Borrow it from the library so you can return it,"Wow, I just totally dislike the attitude of this book, and I veer toward the crunchy side -- I like tofu and cook mostly vegetarian.While skimming through it tonight, I kept going, ""Is she cooking for babies and toddlers? Or DOGS?"" I mean....she basically wants you to feed your baby the same ""super porridge"" day in and day out, even though she can't stand the taste of it herself. Why do you not just feed yourself mush with vitamin supplements stirred in? What about the importance of different textures and flavors, and the FUN in eating?? This book's going back tomorrow.My favorite chapters (arts & crafts, and homemade cleaning products) had nothing at all to do with ""baby food"", and I'm fairly confused about why they're in there to begin with."
1,Way too preachy,I checked out the book from the library (glad I didn't waste money on this book). She is way too preachy and opinions on somethings (meat) are over the top and also dangerous (nuts). My older daughter is allergic to peanuts and I wouldn't think of starting my 6 month old on nut butters as she thinks is just fine. I'm glad that I'm not a stupid person to take everthing she says to heart. Take with a grain of salt or find out how to make baby food with another book. I hope other books are better than this one.
3,"Terribly written, but veggie cooking tips helpful","This book is absolutely painful to read and needs a good editor, but I would buy it again just for the section at the back on preparing and freezing different types of fruits and vegetables. There were foods that I knew might be good for my baby, but I wasn't sure which form of cooking would be best. If you plan to feed your baby animal protein, don't rely on this book for help or recipes in that area.The author's holier-than-thou attitude is incredibly irritating, and I find her to be a bit on the bizarre side. For example, she details precisely how to clean broken glass off a kitchen floor, noting that her final step is to walk on it barefoot to see if any fragments remain. Hmmm.... That said, I still think the cooking info and SOME of the info about when to introduce certain veggies and fruits makes the book worth buying (used if you can)."
5,GREAT BABY FOOD BOOK,I really really love this book. My sister gave it to me after using it successfully with her two children. I have just started using it for the past month. I love how it tells you how to make everything and goes into great detail on how to store everything safely. It also tells you how to grow your own food! That is so awesome because it is so much cheaper to grow your own. Did you know you can even make your own rice cereal? It tells you how to do that too!
4,Awesome,"Very helpful!! Some of the lingo is dated, so beware. There's a chapter on microwaves and it says something to the effect of ""if you are one of the few who get the luxury of a microwave..."". Other than that, this is a really helpful book!"
4,Great for Veggie-Family,"Ruth's book is wonderful, especially if you are a vegetarian parent. Lots of ideas, guidelines, recipes, etc. Some are too earthy-crunchy for this granola-making mom, but I'd highly recommend it. I refer to it so often, I leave it on my kitchen counter. Worth it."
4,"Although it can't be blindly followed, it helped us very much with our allergies!","Yes, the book has glaring errors (peanuts before 2 years old, homemade spinach and carrots - although the book specifically addresses these concerns on pages 38-39 of my edition, and the like). However, this book has been, literally, a life saver for my children, who have severe allergies. Without this book, I would have never been able to isolate peas as an allergen for my my daughter. Also, the recipes, although quite bland to an adult palate, are enjoyed by the kids. The homemade arts and crafts section is a bonus for the little ones. Overall, it's a good book (if you are supplementing the food introductions with research elsewhere)."
5,Great Book,"My sister used this book for her baby - all the way through his first year of life - I sometimes helped her to make the food (it's surprisingly easy), and more often to feed the food to the baby. She loved the book and believed it saved her a lot of money while allowing her to give her son natural wholesome homemade foods. I now give this book as a baby shower gift, regularly."
3,"Omnivores beware, this book is designed for vegetarians.",Everyone should know in advance that this book is designed to make your baby a vegetarian. The author does not divulge this information until deep in the book. I kept wondering why she never mentioned introducing meats until the end. This is not a good book for those of us who want to feed our babies more diverse diets including meat.
2,A lot of book with very little good information,"There is some good information in this book, but a lot of garbage to sort through to get to it. I am a new mother, I work, I am busy- So get to the point! Also, I am not going to cook two meals forever, and I have been feeding my daughter table food since she was 10 months old. This book does not teach you how to get your baby to eat table food, but assumes you will be making seperate meals. Although she claims it is easy and fast, it is not that fast.I also object to her tone (for instance ""the whiter the bread, that faster you're dead""). I can feel plenty guilty about my lack of parenting skills on my own. I don't need a book to add to it."
4,It's Worth the Wading,"Being thick and text intensive, this book is a little daunting at first--but it's packed full of such useful information that it's worth wading through. It doesn't just tell you how to make the food, it explains the reasons why you should and shouldn't feed certain foods to your baby.This is the only book I've found on baby food which shows you how to make your own baby cereal. It's not very hard, and so much healthier.My only criticism would be that it makes feeding solids seem more complicated than it is. Although it bills itself as the only book you need on feeding your baby, I recommend reading as many as you can. They all give slightly different timetables of when to start which foods. I found it much less stressful when I realized there was no one right way.A bonus: Ruth Yaron has a web site with updates and corrections for her book. She also answers FAQs and you can email her with your own questions."
2,If you want a textbook (vegetarian) buy this.,"Way too wordy, not a cookbook; more of a text on infant nutrition with recipes included. Difficult to reference, & hold pages open while preparing. Best thing in it is the cake section in the back. I returned."
4,Wonderful Reference!!,"I LOVE this book!! It is the most complete resource I have come across! Yaron includes an entire section on how to choose, store, prepare, and at what age to start feeding almost any type of fruit and veggie. That was the most helpful part of the book! She also outlines what you caan feed your baby month by month. This was also a very useful tool! She is a little long winded, but still I will use this book for a long time to come!! Definately a must for your book shelf!"
5,a must-have for every new parent,I highly recommend this book to all new parents. It has a wealth of information on feeding your baby and toddler as well as practical advice on how to prepare the foods and where to obtain them. Not only am I feeding my baby nurtitiously but our family is eating better as well!
5,A Very Valuable Resource,"I am a real ""information hound"" and seek very complete resources. This book is better than my wildest dreams for a baby-food-and-beyond reference! It has enabled me to make ALL of my baby's food, as well as guiding me through the maze of nutritional information. I recommend this book to every new mother I know!"
2,"Some good stuff, some not so good","Let me start off by saying this is a very unorganized book. Many things are repeated, and many things are very randomly placed.With that being said, I liked some of the ideas in the book - the tips about making yogurt and many of the recipes. That's why I give the book the two stars.However, Yaron suggests feeding nuts to little babies, and that is, well, NUTS! I'm glad her kids are still well. Also, after reading this book, I am convinced that she must spend all of her waking moments either preparing or thinking about preparing food for her children. My suggestion for anyone considering this book, also considerThe Well Fed Baby: Healthy, Delicious Baby Food Recipes That You Can Make at Home."
3,"A little crazy, but still helpful","There are part of this book that just made me laugh. Her advice on using the dishwasher or making your own hairspray was hysterical, not helpful. When she focuses on food, though, it's a good education for both new parents and adults. There are a lot of good suggestions (such as using flaxseeds) that make sense for anyone's diet."
4,A must for first time moms,"This book is alittle over the top for me with making all your own food and feeding kids broccoli for breakfast, however it has great suggestions for toddler food. You need to take some of it with a grain of salt but once you get past that it is a great boy with loads of information!!! I've bought several for gifts."
5,Step-by-step Guide To Feeding Your Baby,"Ms. Yaron makes it easy to feed your baby a wholesome, yet thrifty diet. No detail is left uncovered. She addresses every question a parent might have in regard to food preparation and planning for your precious one(s). She details how to make everything from smashed bannanas to making your own bread, dried fruit and yogurt. She writes in a way that is easy to understand and almost invites the reader to try her thrifty tips and recipes. I have read this book 3 times, and I joke with my husband that it is my all-time favorite book. I honestly refer to it daily. An absolute must-have! Jaime"
5,Every baby can be a Super Baby!,"I have waited for a book of this type to explain to me in simple terms how to prepare baby food for my super baby. This book not only tells you about different foods, but when to introduce them, how to tell if they are ripe and how to prepare them. It also explains how to get the most from nutrients by combining certain foods like eggs and orange juice to get the maximum amount of iron. I have both the old version and the new. The updated info I used for my son's 3rd birthday party and it was a hit! I am due to deliver another super baby any day now and plan on making his food, too. I cannot tell you how proud I am of myself and how good I feel as a mother by providing my children with the optimal nutrition and a healthy start to their lives! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ruth Yaron!!!"
2,Also Disappointed,"I was misled by previous reviews and agree the recipes are too ""natural"". It took me two weeks to find out what tahini is (the main ingredient in the author's ""Super Cereal"")!"
3,"Helpful, Yet an Example of Desktop Publishing Gone Awry","I did find this book helpful once I was able to decyper Yaron's ""stream-of-consciousness"" approach to authorship. Topically, Super Baby Food jumps around -- a lot -- but there's good information to be garnered once you get past the proselytizing."
1,Too much bragging,To the author -Please stop bragging about your kids. I think that should reduce the size of the book.
1,Super paranoid,"This author is too paranoid! She thinks people shouldn't drink soda until they are 21 years of age... come on?! As a first time mother, there are enough things to worry about regarding your baby and this book tries to make you neurotic in every category possible. I am taking this book back to the store."
2,"A little too ""Natural"" for me","I carefully researched many baby cookbooks and decided to purchase this one based on customer comments. I was disappointed to find I wouldn't eat, nor have on hand many of the items she recommended to feed my baby. Dessicated powdered liver? Brewers yeast? Whole grains only from natural food stores? Nut and seed milk? This is a great book if you are already a natural food buyer and a vegetarian, but NOT if you are an average mom who goes to a regular grocery store, and God forbid, eats red meat occasionally. Having a baby changes your life enough!! If I complied with all of her recommendations, I would have to completely change my family's eating habits and where we shop. Is it possible to make baby food that is healthy, yet is more accomodating to our lifestyle?Plus, the author sometimes is a bit ""preachy"" (""No carbonated drinks until age 21"")and overdoes all of her instructions. Must we be reminded to clean out our strainer, or keep the lid on our food processor?"
2,reduce by 400 pages!,"this book has some good information but it has so much extra junk in it. I think Ruth Yaron must be paid by the page. It was recommended to me by two friends, but I won't be recommending it to others. It is full of useless warnings such as telling me not to make faces when changing my child's stinky diaper because he'll think ""...private parts are repulsive and lead him to believe that sex is dirty when he gets older""It did make me laugh out loud, but it isn't the kind of advice I need to feed my baby."
4,A Good Starter,"I think this is a great book for first time parents. I own the second edition, and I didn't find it difficult to read at all. I wouldn't say that everything is totally accurate (after all, as parents, I'm sure we're into researching big time!), and I'm definitely not following everything, BUT it is definitely a great book to get parents interested in nutrition! I also love the home tips, and all the play-time ideas, too. It is a good resource for a SAHM who doesn't have heaps of money to splash around but wants the best for her kids."
2,Get this book from the library instead,"If you are interested in making your own baby food, check this book out from the library and spend your money on a different book (if you feel you must buy one). I got this book before my son was born and felt some of the additives unnecessary and recipes unappealing. I made my own baby food for him, but I used more common sense than this book. I also could never find the author's qualifications, so I don't know if the author is a qualified nutritionist, or just someone who wrote a book about feeding her kids."
3,Good Resource for Some Things,"This book is a good resource if you are trying to figure out how to introduce solid foods. I use only two sections: one that gives you a month by month program of what to start your baby on and one that provides specific information on foods. I think I could probably get all this information on the internet or other cheaper sources and probably would not buy the book again if I found myself without it.There are extensive sections on how to make cute cakes and other things that are not baby-related.I have food allergies and am very careful with what and how I feed my daughter. I expected more information about starting solid foods and food allergies, but didn't find what I was looking for."
3,jumps around...,"Ruth jumps around alot at the beginning, which makes it hard to get a clear picture of what to feed and how. Lots of recipies and ideas in the back of the book though. Also has a nice table/worksheet that summarizes how many servings of each type of food/nutrient a baby needs per day (reminds me of Richard Simmons' Deal a Meal). Makes it easy to see when you've given all the baby needs for the day. Overall, good resource, but don't expect it to be a one-stop clear explanation of everything you need to know about feeding your baby."
2,Good Not Great,This book is filled with information but not well organized and too many cross-references/redundancies make it thicker than it needs to be. Some information just raised more questions and didn't offer specifics... I was left feeling frustrated and as if I needed to do further research via other sources before being confident enough to have a 'game plan' on implementing solids for my baby. Best for recipes if you are set on making your own food.
2,Meat is not all that bad,"As many reviewers, I agree that this book should have Vegetarian somewhere in the title. The chapter about meat should better be left out. Essentially it consists of intimidatory warnings about the risks of handling meat. But, guess what, humans have prepared and consumed meat for quite some time, and we have developed safe methods for handling it (like cooking and washing).The thousands of cases of food illness from meat should be compared to the billions of cases (daily) where meat consumption results in a satiated stomach. Meat consumption is clearly a choice, and it is clear that we need to be careful with our resources, but it is resoundingly safe."
2,I kept referring to the same 10-12 pages in the book that I wanted.,"This book is full of information that isn't really read a lot. I only referred to pages that stated at what age to give a child what type of food. That was the only really helpful part of this book. I thought the author was incorrect about having babies try ground up nuts, soy, and the like. I avoided these recipes because my children may have been allergic. Come to find out they aren't, but it wasn't worth the risk."
4,good,This appears to be a good book but the material is a lot to digest with not enough visuals. It is a good read just a bit overwhelming.
1,"If you are not a vegitarian, don't but this book!","I bought this book with the intention of making my own baby food for my son. I wanted to find a book to tell me how to cook and combine some of the jarred foods I had been feeding him, such as sweet potato and turkey, and apples and chicken, but to my surprise found that the meat section in this book is nothing less than an statement about how bad meat is and that we are starving the rest of the world by eating it.Being a vegatarian is great, but I think that the title and book description should include that there are very few meat recipies."
5,What a wonderful aid,"This book has been a tremendously helpful tool as I figure out how to feed my infant son. Having a baby is difficult enough, and Ruth Yaron spells everything out, step by step so that you know what to expect, when to expect it. And because we have been feeding our baby such healthy foods, our own diets have improved, as well! I feel so great that I can do something so special for my son, and this book is the main reason that I can do that!"
2,Additional Note on Microwaving,"This is supplemental to a review already posted. The info presented doesn't reflect recent research on how microwaving destroys nutrients (see below), so when preparing or reheating food, try to avoid using the microwave; otherwise you might be better off using commercial organic baby food.""PARIS, Oct 22 (AFP) - Cooking by microwave is the worst way to preserve a key nutrient in vegetables, while steaming is the best, according to a Spanish study reported in New Scientist.Researchers from the national scientific research council CEBAS-CSIC measured antioxidants, a compound believed to protect cells from damaging reactive chemicals called free radicals, in broccoli that had been either steamed, pressure-cooked, boiled or microwaved.Steaming the veggies left the antioxidants almost untouched, but microwaving virtually eliminated them, probably because this heated the broccoli from inside and generated too high a temperature."""
3,Too much to wade through,"If you're looking for a concise list of what foods to introduce when and a few hints about cooking some of your own food--and you're a busy mom--keep looking. I am very conscious of what my baby eats (organic produce, free-range eggs, antibiotic-free milk, etc.), and wanted to prepare some of her food myself, but was overwhelmed by this tome. There's too much extraneous information to wade through--I already know how to select and store produce, for example. I'm sleep deprived and need to access recipes quickly. There's too much text accompanying the preparation instructions. Plus, despite my efforts, my child doesn't like plain veggies or that dreadful plain rice cereal. So, I'm hoping to find a real-life guide to healthy eating for real kids. Maybe something about sneaking veggies into pre-toddler food."
2,No thanks - I'll pass on the soy grits and tofu,"I found this book to be a big dissappointment! It had alot of information, but nothing that was practical for my family. I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone.My biggest concerns about feeding my child was....What and how much can I give her? What age do I introduce new things. How to increase meal sizes.I wanted a book with the basic guidelines. I also wanted a book that used normal everyday ingredients - something that I had on hand or would be able to find easily at the supermarket. I like to feed my child foods that her parents would eat also. I don't see us eating powdered kelp, tahini, or brewer's yeast anytime soon, and that's just to name a few of the ingredients that the author uses frequently."
4,Great Info!,"This book is chock full of great information for the novice baby food maker. It has a great section on fruits and vegetables that tells you how they should be cooked and stored and when they should be introduced. I was not as impressed with the actual recipes as I thought that I would be. The super porridge is a great idea but would be a lot of work to buy and add all of the ""extras"". Overall this book is a must for all parents who are planning to make thier own baby food."
2,Author apparently paid by the word,"I appreciate what the author is trying to convey, that a healthy diet is important for a healthy child. Unfortunately she requires about 600 pages to do it, when probably 150 would have sufficed. After slogging through it, my opinion is that it should have been written more like a reference book, with clear sections and concise information. Instead it is very disorganized and littered with phrases like, ""Please re-read the passage about Water on page 98."" ""Refer to page 142 for information on soybeans.""What a pain. I'm sure there's a better book out there (and I'll let you know when I find it)."
3,Eh... not for beginners,"I really like this book. Once you learn how to read it, it's very useful.That's right. You have to learn to read it.One big problem is that the layout is terrible! You will constantly find yourself jumping from page to page, chapter to chapter.Ruth also doesn't make much mention of nut allergies when she recommends nut butters and the such before the American Academy of Pediatrics does. She mentions it at the very (wordy) beginning and then rarely after that.The book offers up a healthy menu option for each month of your child's life. For those of us who are pretty confused as to what to feed our kids when, this is especially useful.She also shows you how to cook foods that commercially fed babies usually don't get the chance to try: like brown rice, barley, avocado, ect.In all, this book would be better if the unnecessary wording was edited out and the layout made more appealing."
2,"Healthy, but TERRIBLY Disorganized","The reason I gave this 2 stars is because Yaron is advocating a healthy diet, something a lot of Americans are lacking. We need more ""pompous"" authors telling us that processed foods are bad, that white bread is bad, and that meat is NOT an essential part of a baby's diet.However I regret purchasing this book because it is completely disorganized. Really, it is an absolute mess! The index is a wreck as well. Moms of infants do not have the time to pick through all of the cross-references.Also, many of the tips are completely out-there and ridiculous. Cutting up a sweatshirt to make a bib? Making your own hairspray? Come on! At least the tips are good for a laugh - and there are one or two that are actually useful - of course you have to weed through a lot of drivel to get to them.Don't bother with this book!!!"
3,"Useful info, but balance with doctor's advice","This book has some good suggestions and recipes, but I chose not to try any of the suggestions to use nuts as a main part of the diet so early. Even though I don't have nut allergies in my family, my pediatrician warned against introducing nuts given the recent growing tendency in the US to severe nut allergies. However, I particularly liked the section on how to make yogurt."
2,not impressed,"This book came as a recommendation from my pediatrician. I have loved all of the books he's recommended. But this one was not on my ""favorites"" list. It is not very well organized and is hard to wade through. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that some of the statements in the book like ""be careful of your facial expression while changing your child's diaper so as to not make them think that their body is gross"" are a little silly. The recipes/activities in the back of the book are a nice touch, but you can find a recipe for play-do or bubbles from countless other sources. I would not spend the money to buy this book just for those pages."
4,Good Resource,"This book is full of practical information on starting your baby on solid foods. I particularly liked the advice on making vegetables and fruits--I saved a bundle by making baby food myself, and its really easy. However, some of her information is (in my opinion) extreme and unrealistic, such as her views on meat. I also was not comfortable with the homemade ""super porridge"", since most registered dietitians recommend using iron-fortified infant cereal for the first two years. All in all, though, the book is very helpful and I refer to it often."
2,Book better if 1/2 the size & covered 2x the range of food,"I purchased this book because I, like the author, care deeply about what our children eat. However, she could have given all of her fabulous ideas about food portions, prep and storage techniques, and nutrition in about 1/4 of the amount of text. Even better if it had been without dizzying cross-referencing, moronic ""tips"" after every other paragraph (can't believe an editor even glanced at this book) and morbid horror-stories meant to ""warn us"" about choking and burns. The book is also very unbalanced by assuming that everyone is open to excluding meat and giving their child supplements like brewer's yeast and dessicated liver on a regular basis in order to achieve the ""perfect diet""."
4,good resource--skip the wacko stuff,"This book is a great resource for making just about every type of baby food imaginable. Great tool if you skip some of the author's personal crusades against meat, etc. Even with that, though, I would recommend this book to my fellow moms (and dads) if they are interested in preparing some or all of their own baby food."
1,yuk,"This was a useless book! I wouldn't dream of eating any of the food in this book. We wanted to train our little one to love good food, not to eat bizarre combinations of things that he would never encounter again in the adult world (I would hope)."
2,vegetarian baby food,"I didn't realize before I bought this book that it was for vegetarian babies. Some of the suggestions are outside the ordinary. If you are not a vegetarian or do not desire your infant to be one, then another book is likely better. it has good info on what vitamins are in what fruit and veg and gives a good idea of portions and the range of things that you should feed your baby. The month by month suggestions are helpful. There is an overemphasis on what the author calls Super Porridge. Many infants grow out of the desire to eat so much cereal. I would supplement this book with another."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I have been feeding my daughter homemade baby food for 2 months and I was at the point where I didn't know what to introduce next to her. The doctors had told me a few things but she had been eating those foods. I read about this book in another wonderful book, BABY BARGAINS, which helped us register.I received the book a few days ago and just love that it tells me month-by-month what Paige can eat. It tells me how to select the foods (especially if it's a food I've never prepared!), store, help to ripen, prepare and freeze. It's a bit over the top in some parts, like boiling your baby's water. We live in a large suburb and she's had our tap water since she was 7 weeks old in her formula. I'm not boiling her water!Overall, this is a great go-to guide to help you prepare your baby some yummy food!"
2,Toooooo much advice,"Sorry but this book just had way to much advice for me. All I was looking for were some quick, healthy ideas to make my baby some food at home and I ended up with the ""mother"" of all textbooks. Seriously if I read one more ""tip"" or ""warning"" from her I just don't know what I'll do...."
3,Not the only book you'll need,"The main failing of this book is a lack of information about meat. The author tries to scare you out of feeding your baby meat, even though it is one of the easiest ways to nourish you child (essential amino acids, iron) and the majority of parents in this country will feed meat to their child. In fact, in her section about iron, she does not even mention meat as a source of iron although the iron in meat is absorbed more than iron from plants and many babies starting solid foods see a drop in iron levels, and iron deficiency in babies under two can cause serious developmental problems.You can feed your child a vegetarian diet, you should just talk to your pediatrician first and possibly a nutritionist. The author of this book is neither."
1,Not worth the money--even for vegetarians,"As a health conscious vegetarian, I can tell you this book is not worth the money. As many other readers have noted, the book is not organized well, skips around, etc. Several other readers have complained that the book is for vegetarians. As a vegetarian, I can tell you that this book is for health fanatics who pinch and squeeze every penny. Even the recipe section is poor. A much better selection for the general public is a book called ""First Meals"". ""First Meals"" will show you how to make homemade baby food from every day ingredients--including many vegetarian selections."
2,Not for moms and dads in the real world,"While I'm all for trying to feed your child healthy foods, Ruth Yaron goes way off the deep end. Feeding your baby brewer's yeast and homemade ground up millet, barley, and brown rice (which are NOT iron-fortified, by the way) is way ridiculous. And when I read her recommendation to boil all tap water before giving it to your baby, not to mention letting the water run in the morning for a few minutes to remove the contaminated water that has been sitting in your pipes all night, I knew I was dealing with someone not living in the real world. If you want a great baby food cookbook with recipes for people in the real world, get ""Mommy Made"" by Martha Kimmel instead - easy and healthy recipes made from normal, everyday ingredients that also follow the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics."
3,A little bit paranoid...,"It's an OK book...but the steps described when making baby food are very tedious. Moreover, there is some paranoia going on...I am not going to use a straw to suck the last little bit of air out of a freezer bag before sticking it in the freezer. Just press and zip. I think this book is making baby food at home much more complicated than it needs to be. However, there was some good advice as to when to introduce which food and what to look out for when shopping for produce. Not my favorite, but it's OK."
5,Everything you need to know about feeding your child! and more!,"I received ""Super Baby Food"" book from my sister-in-law, and let me tell you, it was so helpful! Great tips on how to make natural baby food that is healthy, nutritious and delicious for your baby, non-toxic and safe ways to clean your house, keep nasty insects away, projects you and your child can do together, and more! My daugther is four years old now and I still consult the Super Baby Food book! A keeper!"
1,Not what it seems,"This book jumps around so much it is hard to follow. You start to read one section, it then refers you to another page, usually in another section. I like to read one topic, THEN move on to another. There are not complete thoughts on one page in any section. I rate this book poorly, also because she is not even qualified to give this advice. I learned that thanks to the disclaimer on the first page. She keeps telling me to check with the doctor. I should have just did that in the beginning instead of wasting money on this book. On a good note, there are crafts in the back that will be of some assistance as my baby goes into to toddlerhood."
1,Way too preachy,"I found this book to be very restrictive and overly cautious. For example, stating that cooked cauliflower should not be given to babies under 9 months (not sure why), but my baby loved cauliflower cheese at 7 months and this was heartily approved by my pediatrician.The author is also very anti-meat. Unless you come from a vegetarian family with strong beliefs on this matter, I think that meat is important to young babies who need as much iron as possible in their early lives.On top of all this, the book is really ugly to read and it's not easy to find your way around. Annabel Karmel's books are much superior in my opinion."
2,This book needs editing!,"There is some useful information but the same thing could have been said in less than half as many pages. It seems that it wasn't edited. And sadly, the interior appears to have been 'designed' in Microsoft Word rather carelessly without thought to readability. There is way too much digression into other related topics when the reader just wants to get to the info about making and storing the baby food."
2,A little daunting...,"As a first time mother I like this book as a reference. However, the author's approach to preparing food and caring for children in general is quite daunting! As my friend phrased it, ""You may feel the need to climb inside your sterilized refrigerator to make your baby's food!"" I was recommended this book and would say that it is a good overview, especially the itemized section describing methods for dealing with many fruits and vegetables. You just may want to supplement it with another, less paranoid resource."
4,Super book for my Super Baby,"Super Baby Food (by Ruth Yaron) has been an unbelievable help to me as I strive to feed my 6 month old baby healthy, inexpensive food. With the money I am saving on baby food and Drs visits we can go on vacation! It is so much fun preparing homemade food for my daughter."
5,A Wonderful Way to Feed Baby,"Super Baby Food is the most versatile book dealing with how to feed your baby that I've found. Many people realize how important good eating habits are, and that they're formed with the first foods we eat.It's a great book for healthy, nutritional, whole grain foods, even vegetarian foods. My baby loves the recipes in this book!"
4,super baby foods,"As a first-time mother, I found this book to be very helpful. I would never have had the confidence to attempt making my own baby food otherwise.It was great to have some point of reference for what, when and how to introduce solid food to my daughter. While I do try to eat healthy myself and avoid red meats, I am not quite as radical a vegetarian as Ms. Yaron is, and of course I routinely consult my pediatrician if I am unsure of anything. Nonetheless, the information has been very helpful to me to at least get me started. I also found the safe-cleaning-products section helpful."
2,Too Much Repetitive Information,"While there is some useful information about making fresh baby food and safely storing it, most of the book is repetitive. Also, a bit ridiculous - who wants to make their own yogurt from scratch? A better book is ""First Meals."""
2,Not good for a child with many food allergies,"I was given this book as a present. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it because most of the recipes discussed in the book include food items that my son is severly allergic to.This book did not help me at all. In fact, it made me more frustrated because the author kept saying how wonderful this diet was :( For other parents: if your child has an egg, wheat and/or dairy allergy, this book will not help you."
2,Disappointing,"This book was highly reccomended to me as a way to be able to prepare my own baby food and while there is a wealth of information in this book, it really should be updated for 2005. This book is not very user friendly as you will CONSTANTLY be cross referencing several different pages (what new parent has time to do that?!) And while I will eventually use some of the recipes, after having a lengthy discussion with my pediatrition about her feeding suggestions, this book was not for me."
5,A well-used resources - fantastic!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I constantly return to it to reference recipes, get ideas, and read Yaron's tips for a healthy household. It is nicely organized into a month by month look at what you should feed your infant. She is an amazing cross-referencer. I really liked the safe household cleaning advice as well. It is a very thorough book and very well done. I would love to see Yaron do another book with a specific focus on organic toddlers (although this book includes toddler recipes, I'd like more general information about feeding toddlers and options for gluten-free and dairy-free households). Well done Ruth Yaron!"
4,Helpful addition to your homemaking of baby food,"I am a Registered Nurse. This is our third child. I have always been one for making my own baby food, since I feel it is better and it is DEFINITELY more cost-effective than jars(and smells much better(smile)). Ruth Yaron did a great deal of research to make this book possible and it was a great help! Even with the third child there are great recipes and nutrition facts. But I do most certainly recommend asking your pediatrician first if presenting the foods in order that Ruth presented them as being okay(especially if there allergies that run on either side of the family). She also presented other thrifty ways for crafts and even things to clean the house with(like we have the time(smile)).Get the book, it was worth the price and if nothing else see if your library carries it or can get it for you!"
2,A Vegetarian Cookbook,"While this is a fairly good and informative book, it is by no means comprehensive. This should be sold as a vegetarian cookbook- there are only 5 pages in the chapter on meat, and only 3 meat recipes. I spent more on this book because it was advertised as being one of the very best for making homemade baby food, but now I find that I have to buy another book just to get recipes that use meat. I think that this book is deceiving in the way it is advertised."
5,Must have for feeding baby!,"When I first started reading this book it was overwhelming. The next day I looked at it again and loved it. The thing is even if you don't make any of your own baby food this book is still very helpful. My son is only 6 months so I've barely made any food for him I mostly buy it, but the information from the book has made me confident about what I'm doing. I'm now looking foreward to making my own babyfood (and saving $) Plus the index has a ton of great playdough and arts & craft ideas, etc. The auther Ruth Yardon is very knowledgable and a REAL life mom with REAL experience. It's a perfect reference book to keep around for the first couple years. My good friend has a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old and she swears by it. This is going to be my staple baby shower gift."
3,"Some good, some bad","I wanted to make my own baby food, and didn't know the first thing about starting out. This book gave me that information. It has a ton of good information on cooking and storing foods for your baby. She stresses organic, but if you don't live in a city, you might as well forget getting dececnt organic foods. My baby wasn't eating the jarred stuff, but she ate what I made, and she is very healthy.But I can't believe she recommends feeding peanuts and peanut butter to kids under the age of three! Don't do it! I have a son with a peanut allergy. Believe me, it's not worth the risk. I think she goes overboard with a lot of her suggestions (I would never dream of washing out my ziploc bags!), but I still use it as a reference. My husband refers to the author as ""that crazy lady"" LOL"
3,It literally made me dizzy,"Her overall message and passion for feeding children nutritious food is inspiring. However, as a Mom of a very fussy 14 month old (who only wants to eat meat, crackers, potatoes and rice), I find it an extremely difficult read. I am sure if you have the time and patience to read the book from the start, it is much easier to grasp everything. For those of us who have a pretty good handle on nutrition and just want some good, healthy, easy recipes, it's overwhelming. I really was dizzy reading it. But it did inspire me to try some hummus on my son's whole grain toast and he did like it, so that in itself is a good thing! That said, I am now searching Amazon for a simpler, straightfoward book. This seems more like a way of life, which you may or may not be ready to commit to."
3,Better book for toddlers,I wanted to make recipes for my 6 month old and found recipes mostly for toddlers. This book provided more information than I wanted and included recipes for making cereal and used nut/seed products. It even recommended giving a baby brewers yeast. This book was too organic for my tastes.
4,"Great advice, poor layout","This book has been indispensable to me as a guide for making my daughter's food. There are entries for every month of the baby's life in the first year that give clear information about what new foods can be introduced. (There is also info for toddler eating, but I am not there yet) Towards the back of the book is a list of foods with information about storing, preparing, etc. that comes in very handy.Unfortunately, the layout of this book is crazy--the type is so close together that it is hard to read, there is often too much information and this overflow of info is often of the over-cautious kind. I think someone should write a guide to reading this book to make it a little easier."
3,Unorganized!,"This book has a lot of useful information regarding baby food, but it also has TONS of USELESS information. For example: how to load your dishwasher, save energy, wash your hands, use a blender, etc. It is very repetetive and unorganized. And unless you are a vegetarian, and plan to raise your kids that way, forget it! It is pretty much a vegetarian baby food book. If you have the time to read the whole book, you'll be able to pick out the important parts. It should have been half as long. I couldn't imagine knowing this woman - she is a freak!"
2,"Weird food suggestions, hard to read","I got this as a gift and did not like it. I want to feed my baby healthy stuff but wheat germ?? No, thanks. Plus it's hard to find your way around the book. I want something easy and practical, that book is not it."
2,OK for vegans,"This book teaches extreme veganism - not for me. Also, I found it a complete waste of time to make my own baby food, when my baby was eating table food by eight months."
2,Too Crunchy for the Average Mom,"This book is way too ""out there"" for me. I am a big fan of healthy baby food and wanted to try making my own, so I bought this book based on several recommendations. I was shocked to see that her recipe for baby cereal included desicated liver, dried kelp, and brewer's yeast, none of which you'll find in my kitchen!The book also is too long. It's littered with ""tips"" unrelated to baby food, like advising us to wear real vanilla behind our ears as a cologne. Please. I suggest getting ""Mommy Made and Daddy too! Home cooking for a healthy baby and toddler"" instead."
3,Overwhelming and Some Misinformation,"This book is FULL of great ideas and suggestions and directions.However, having said that, I gave my book away to my friend who wanted it. I found that it was way way to overwhelming for me. I felt lost to begin with, which is why I was picking up a book about feeding my baby. All this book did was to overwhelm me even more and make me concerned I was doing everything wrong.To top this off, I found some misinformation in this book. I think other reviewers spoke of this as well. Maybe it is just based on old information regarding feeding babies and will be updated sometime soon. One can only hope.I would carefully research and look at other books before buying this one. However, if you want the be all end all book of directions for feeding your baby, this may be the one you want."
3,A little overboard,"I had taken my time purchasing a ""cookbook"" for my now almost 11 month old son. I just recieved the book a day ago and found the beginning quite informative and was excited to venture into different tastes and textures to vary his diet. I flipped through several pages that didn't pertain to us (since my son is now on solid foods and such). But I was disappointed that the author seriously lives and breathes organic, all-natural and health food store ingredients. Now I want the best nutrition possible for my little guy, but I don't even eat that stuff! I believe in eating healthy well rounded meals, but I just feel that this is a bit extreme. I am currently thumbing through some recipes in the center of the book that seem pretty desent and will try them. Maybe I'm just ignorant to the foreign side of ""healthy eating"". Or maybe I had something else in mind."
2,Mediocre at best,"As a live food and lifestyle instructor I am always researching different books on food and especially kids. This book, has some good information. However, I found most of it out of date and has a lot of incomplete information, and not always what I consider healthy. Its also very wordy and I would never recommend to my clients. Compared to other books out there this book is mediocre at best. I suggest purchasing a higher quality book."
3,My doctor warned me against some of the things she suggests,(like giving a baby younger than 1 year cooked egg yolks -potential salmonella poisoning even though they are cooked- and nuts - potential serious allergen -so I can't give it my highest ratings. But it looks like a good basic course on food safety when you're making homemade baby food.
1,Don't buy,Only three tracks and only one is OK. The other two are weak.Just download title track for 99 cents if you're curious.
3,Not very smoky,It's fairly light and bland compared to other smoked paprika I've had. Good price but mediocre flavor. Try some of the others offered even if they're more expensive.
3,Paprika with out Seal,This product came with out a seal under the cap. The Hickory Smoke flavor is very weak either from missing seal or inexpensive paprika. The product may have been returned before and seal was taken off or made with no seal . Needs seal to retain its flavor!!!
4,bent barral,when i got this it look like it was smash by something the barral was bent alittle but it wont affect the ball when shot.
2,"Looks great, but breaks down and becomes loose.","This Barrel is 16"" and works great for long range accuracy. The price is reasonable and the items that you receive are just fine.After a few uses you have to tighten the bolts back down because it starts to become loose and jiggle. The site starts to move around and the components on the barrel need to be re-adjusted. Not to mention when I got my barrel in the mail, I put it on and it was perfect upside down...I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to impress their friends, but when it comes to function it requires too much fix.I got tired of it and took all the parts off the gun and now simply have a 16"" barrel.When it comes down to it, thanks... but no thanks."
3,Wtf cant tak apart stress out,it looks like a good barrel but the thing is lose read the comments but i took of the cap and have my now i cant fint the screw on the sights were the hell is it lol it pissing me off try to figure this out i read people stuff and its hard to understand ahhh if u get stress easy dont buy
4,"16"" Tippmann 98 Custom Barrel","Overall it is a pretty good barrel. However it is only held together with one metal bar running through it. That means the more you take it on and off the looser it gets. Then the casing starts to shift around and the sights will be off. But it isn't that bad, if you can get past that."
5,ive had the barrel for a long time,love it... spirralled barrel. got the m16 shroud on it... just wanna know if it'll fit and X7 phenom?? anyone know if it will.
5,Great barrel!,"ok first of all this barrel came lightning quick, i ordered it on a saturday at 12:30 a.m. and it was delivered on monday. when i put the barrel on my gun it almost lined up perfectly but when i shot it i was a little disappointed... everyone was raving about how much further the ball travels and how straight they travel but my shots kept dropping...not even hitting the target from 20 yards...then soon after a few more shots, i was out of air. got the tank refilled and BAM! i was smokin the targets i had set up from 30-35 yards away. even further if i had the room, great awesome barrel, just dont use cheap paintballs, i ran out of my good ones so i was in a hurry and got cheap-o's and woooo boy they didnt fly straight after that...3 out of 10 would hit the target while the rest would go every which direction but at the target. great barrel at a cheap price!!"
3,Barrel,"I got my barrel pretty quickly. I put it on my gun and the sight didn't line up. Tools came with it but not directions, although it was pretty easy to figure out how to fix it. After having the sight lined up I went out side to see the accuracy of this thing, it wasn't very good but it wasn't bad at the same time. The sight is a little to high so I cant see the paintball when I shoot it but I can find my way around it. Over all I like it, it looks awesome while at the same time it gives you better accuracy and its not full metal so its lighter."
2,Better have a strong signal.,"The antenna and the rf to mini jack adapter aren't worth anything at all. Plugging in rabbit ears or even attaching to a large roof top antenna still left me with a poor picture, even though this line has been plenty to get a nice picture on other sets. Ultimately I had to run a powered inline signal amplifer to get a couple of channels to come in good, and a couple that are still barely acceptable. I think if you are not planning on hooking this thing to cable or satellite, save your money."
1,Very poor,"I did try with this book as there are so few Interracial books, but I just thought this book was terrible. The plot had a good premise, but it didn't deliver. Jacqueline was very tiresome she just cried a lot and Henrico was so overly macho. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,What a Nice Journey!,"Passion's Journey was a VERY good read. I completely enjoyed the main characters - Jacci and Henrico - and the supporting characters - Maxi, Phillip, Jason, etc. The love scenes were tastefully erotic and the story line (look for the ex-boyfriend/girlfriend) kept me interested.I didn't give it five stars because some situations were to easily solved but other than that...a very pleasant read."
4,work with it,Yes there are some problems Jacqueline gets on your nerves and Rico is to commending but the basic story is great. I bought this book in 2003 and have reread it several times. There is is something about the couple and their friends that just make it seem pausible. The only reason it isn't a 5 star is due to the publishig company that never seems to edit. I looked at the author's other books and saw that some of the characters are in 2 other books which pricked my interest. Does anyone know what happen to the author there is nothing on amazon for her since 2002?
1,Passionless Journey,"I read a couples of favorable reviews for this book and was searching to find a copy. I finally got a copy and oh my goodness, I practically ripped my hairs out by the root trying to finish this book.After the long wait, I was totally disappointed. The lead characters were two of the most boring people not to mention that the story had no flow and made no sense. They met on a cruise and after two days they are in love, Lord have mercy, I was too confused for words.This was definitely a bad choice to purchase this book. What a waste of my $8.95."
5,My Hedgie Loves Them & So Do I!,"My hedgehog loves getting a few mealworms a week but I prefer these because I don't have to deal with live ones, they keep for a long time, and they are a really good deal. I highly recommend them."
1,"Amateurish, error-filled art","Lee Townsend is a comic book inker, not a penciller. The technique shown is okay, but the underlying substance of the art is weak. The untrained eye will notice that many of the illustrations look ""off"" or ""not quite right."" The trained artist can identify the numerous proportion, pose, perspective, foreshortening, and anatomy errors. Composition (panel or page) and storytelling are not addressed.This book might be worth a glance through to become familiar with the illustration process, provided the reader has enough of an artistic foundation to not be led astray by the erroneous instruction and bad advice."
4,Un CD a toda Madre,"Este disco esta de chingon. Tiene nortenas, romaticas y tambien unas de Rancheras Compa! Patin del Diablo, Amate Apasionado, Dos cartas marcadas, son unas de las mejores nortenas que tiene Polo. Si me quieren escribir mi e-mail es suavey5@hotmail.com Que no se acaben los Bailes porque se acaba mi vida!"
5,Interesting Material,Many thanks for a most interesting story and material.I hope others will take notice to it and see what a story it is. Best of luck in its future success.
4,Helpful,Helpful book for the study of pathology. Clinical vignettes and pictures make it a great addition to the pocket Robbins.
3,Review of Robbin's Review of Pathology,"I used this book as a resource of practice questions during my pathology courses in Basic Sciences. I feel that this resource is ok, but there are better resources out there. My reasons for my rating are that I found the question stems to provide to much information so that you were easily able to answer the questions,unfortunately this gave me a false sense of security when preparing for exams. On a more positive note I found the explanations to each question very thorough (though I did find a few errors / contradictions in some of the explanations). Over all I think this is an ok resource to use for questions, but I recommend using it in addition to more challenging question banks if you have time."
5,"Wow, can you say helpful?","Sometimes reading through a review book seems like a great way to see what you picked up, but it is too easy to just say, Oh yeah, I knew that, and move on. The images in this book are great, the questions truly assess learning, and the answers continue to enlighten. If you get nothing else in terms of pathology books, get this guy, it is well worth the money.PS I prefer new so that way the questions are not already answered. That is the worst when they are already marked up and it is no longer a learning experience."
4,Had to have it!,"Just a required book for medical school. I wish I could say it's enjoyable reading but I'm learning what I need to and it was recommended that I purchase this particular text, so others seem to think it is grand."
4,Robbin's Review of Pathology,"This review is excellent for those who are preparing for USMLE Step I. The best part of this book is images and the explanation for them. In USMLE Step I, some questions will test you on similar images. Recommend using this book with the BRS Pathology."
1,"This is an old edition, get the 2nd edition (2005).","I don't know why this is, but Amazon doesn't list the new edition unless you type in the ISBN number directly (0721601944). So I wanted to warn off others who might accidentally buy this version of the book."
4,for course work,This are very good questions especially for course work. BUt kaplan q bank is a better alternative for the step 1. You can use this for your course work and use qbank for the step 1. Better yet if u have the time use both for step 1. If you are strapped for time stick with kapln q bank. I had time and i used both and i made 229/95 in step 1.
4,Smooth Jazz,Tony Guerrero is an amazing artist who combines an unusually high sense of melody with skill. He is a pure smoothjazz artist with a touch a latin. I posess his later work Apasionado and I would like to see more of his excellent smoothjazz melodies in the future.
2,Heavy Weighted,"Purchased this as a gift for my elderly Dad to help out with his garden. He loves to get out and rake in the garden but with age he needs lightweight tools. It appeared to be lightweight according to a previous review, however It's not light weight. Needless to say it is now just sitting in the garage as it's too heavy for him to manage."
5,"Excellent, quickly received!",Thanks so much for your quick shipping of this book and it was in excellent condition.Barbara
5,I loved this book!,"This book was wonderful. I got it for Christmas and found it funny, helpful, and very good. Every christian should read this. Ray Comfort reminds me of Paul in the bible. I wish I could meet him and Kirk.Annie from Farmington, Missouri"
5,Replacement parts for my sink,Fit like a charm at $20 less than I could find it locally and it got to me faster. Picture is of a chrome drain but the description said polished brass. I needed polished brass so trust the description even if the picture doesn't match.
1,Got a lemon?,My Plantronics MX505-X1 stopped working after after two weeks. Prior to that is was a satisfactory headset.
2,Plantronics MX505 Black and Silver with Windsmart Boom Headset with 2.5mm Plug,"I always thought that Plantronics was top of the line and the best headset to buy. The only problem is, everytime I use it, my customer asks me if I'm talking to them. This is unacceptable."
2,"Good, but missing feature claimed in description","To amplify what A. Shick says below, this headset does NOT support connecting/disconnecting a call from the headset control, despite what the description very clearly claims. That feature is only available via the 510 X1.I exchanged the 505 I ordered, as having to drag the phone out to answer it sort of defeats the purpose of using a headset. The 510 X1 gets five stars from me."
2,poor sound,I use a headset all the time this one is very hard to get on and I find that the out going signal is very low. I have to take it off for people to hear me a lot of the time
3,"Works well, but painful to wear!","I found the sound quality to be very good with this headset and the volume and mute controls worked well. The problem is the earbud! I have small ears and although the under ear loop works well, the bud that fits into your ear is just too big and becomes quite painful after a short time. I work from home and spend about 70% of my day on the phones, so I need something that is comfortable for extended periods. I would buy this model again for the functionality ONLY if the earbud was changed to something smaller and softer for better comfort with extended use."
2,"Good quality sound, hard to place in ear, mute button broke",The sound quality on both ends is good. The mic seemed to pick up my voice clear and the sound in the ear piece was always clear. The downside was that the ear piece did not fit in my ear very well. Also it is difficult to place into my ear. I've missed many-a-calls trying to get the ear piece into my ear. The mute button/switch broke after about 2 months.
3,good headset quality - bad fit around the ears,I have had this headset and used it for about 8 months. I liked the quality of sound and the mic picked up my voice pretty well. The volume control and mute functionality was great!The downside was that the headset didn't fit around my ear very well. It sort of hung on my ear mostly - wasn't snug. Perhaps my ear is small or the headset isn't just built right - I'm not sure. But because of this I won't be buying another one of these again.
1,False Advertising and stupid design,"Does not have answer/end button, as advertised. I don't care what other bells and whistles ti has, if I have to open the phone to and push the button while driving, what's the point. One star for wasting my time."
2,Plantronics Headset,I was excited to get this product as it was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it would not fit my cell phone or IPod so I am stuck with a useless set. Sending it back costs as much as the product.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH THE BLACKBERRY PEARL!!,"Based on the product description - ""works with Blackberry"" - I bought this headset. I rec'd it quickly, but didn't get the black and grey as ordered. Instead the vendor sent me the tan one. That didn't really matter, but the plug is too small (2.5 mm is not the size the Pearl uses) for my phone. Extremely frustrating because of course I had it out of the blister pack to find this out and now I cannot return it. Argh!!!!!BTW - tried to use an adaptor - no dice. Don't buy this for the Pearl."
1,Bad design; or was it supposed to be a device of torture?,"The way it clips over your ear is very bizarre and hard to get used to, even for someone that is used to over-the-ear headsets. The volume produced by the microphone is barely adequate.Interesting experiment, but I think I will probably be sending this thing back."
4,Good headset.,"I used to have one very similar to this one for my xbox a long time ago, the only difference is that this one does not have a volume control for the mic, that I was hoping for. Anyway it's still awesome and is quite comfy even for long periods of use."
2,Works fine for about a month and then breaks down,"I bought two of these in the last year and the story is the same. It works great for about a month and then the sound goes. I figured, something happens to the microphone, because I can still hear fine, but the person on the other side complains of static and breaking of the sound. I would not recommend it."
1,Not designed for a human ear,"I do not know who this product is intended for... but obviously not a human...I know i have slightly off center ear canals, and often have trouble finding a headset that fits my ear properly, but on the whole, they all FIT just are uncomfortable.This headset on the other hand, doesn't even seem to be designed for the human ear...It has a WEDGE (guitar pick) shaped hear piece that sits LONG wise against your ear canal. It doesn't fit IN or ON the ear canal, it just pushes against your ear and hurts, doesn't fit and falls off with the slightest wiggle.Never in my history of any wired headsets have I come across one so non-ergonmic. I was NEVER able to use this once without it falling off my ear and being severely uncomfortable.Plain and simple... DO NOT BUY (in my opinion)"
5,Excellent Headset and Clever Design,"I love this headset. It's lightweight, easy to adjust for right or left ear, with clear sound on both talk and listen. This headset sounds great when talking, unlike others that sound faint to the listener. It's very clear to listen with, and comfortable due to it's lightweight design so one can leave it on for hours. To switch ears, you simply pivot the ear bud and voila, it fits the other ear. It has a mute and volume control, but I never use them since my phone has a mute button on it and the volume is adjusted the way I like it.I really like this headset and would buy again if I lost it.Plantronics MX505-X1 Windsmart Boom Headset with 2.5mm Plug (Black and Gray)"
4,Plantronics MX505 headset,"I really love this headset. I had one before and it was great but only lasted 8 months. I don't know how long they are supposed to last but I think that cut it a bit short so thats why I only give it 4 stars. I do use it alot, though. I especially like the in line mute and volume control, and the fact that this is NOT over the head. It's comfortable after long periods and it sounds great. No one even knows I'm on a headset. Oh, and it stays on! I've tried a few different others and this one I'll keep going back to. I even bought the plantronics bluetooth headset and that is a great product also."
3,"FYI, this does not answer the calls","Even though the description says it answers calls, it doesn't. Also, the volume on this is terrible if using in a car. I could not hear worth a dang. I had to end up buying a blue-tooth.Update 6/2012.While I couldn't use them with my cell phone on the road, I do use this at home frequently on my cordless landline. It seems to work just fine. I moved this up to 3 stars as I feel that it is a decent option for landline use."
5,Honest product,"I was looking for a wired headset since I did not get used to the bluetooth ones.Being a Plantronics customer helped in this quest and now I am more than happy with the results.My only initial concern had to with the ear support, from the pictures over the web, I thought it might easily fall. But the placemente is very steady and the audio is very good."
3,Great Headset... Incorrect Details,"First, I love this headset. It's very comfortable and has very good sound. That said, the details currently state that it has call answer/end/voice command buttons, when it does not. That is the MX510 which is basically the same headset, but it has a button on the control pod. Don't buy this if you want the button, but it is a great headset otherwise."
5,Petsl es Petzl,Esta lampara es de primera. La luz es impecable y la calidad es de primera. Es una compra con los ojos cerrados.
4,Good light,"It works. I really love the push button operation for when you have something in your hands, or you just cut your nails."
1,"Cheap, flimsy and untrustworthy","This headlamp is not waterproof, as I learned one dark and stormy night when a storm surge came through my camp.This light failed repeatedly in the rain and I only saved myself from disaster by opening it up in the dark and blowing hard on the battery contacts.I now use an Underwater Kinetics headlamp which costs less than the Petzl, is built ruggedly and is waterPROOF to ten meters depth.The Petzl lamp is a toy for weekend warriors.Do not take a risk on it when a reliable product is available."
5,"I may look like a dork, but ...","This headlamp is perfect. I often walk at dusk or dark on roads with no sidewalks. Drivers really see me coming now! I use it on the lowest brightness, which is quite adequate for seeing the road ahead. I bought it for walking, but I've used it twice already for hands-free lighting while doing projects in the house like rewiring an electrical outlet (with the power turned off of course), and adding memory to my PC."
4,Petzl headlamp OK,"The Petzl Tikka Plus works fine and is the second Petzl headlamp I've owned. Very bright and easy to use. My only concern is the housing, which is made of relatively cheap plastic. It might not stand up to heavy use."
4,Good Investment,"I use this product for running in the woods at night time. It is light, doesn't slip down, lights an adequate distance and the up/down adjustments for the light angle are quite useful. The only weird thing about this light is that if you drop it(even lightly)it pops open with the potential for the batteries to fall out. I just hope that never happens when I'm in the middle of the woods at night! Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase."
3,Walk the dog,The Petzl light is a great headlamp with a beam that makes it easy for others to see me. Some draw backs to this product would be the ajustment direction........ when you atempt to change position of lamp the the case opens. I bought another one(different type) from a different vender and the cost was signifcantly less for as good if not better than this product.
4,It served its purpose well! :-),"I am a visually impaired guy who used this exact head lamp to walk home very late at night on a daily basis and all I can say is that this thing has been a life saver literally in enabling me to see curbs, holes, and other obstructions in time to avoid them. Also, this bright light makes me very visible to oncoming traffic in such situations where I have to walk on the road shoulder at night PLUS I can now read street signs in unfamiliar neighborhoods! I did give this hiking light 4 out of 5 stars, though, because the front light cover came off and was lost. Even so, it still works reliably and is a great value and a good deal price-wise! However, at the date of this writing I only use this light now as a reliable back-up due to the recent purchase of a much more durable, brighter (and more expensive) Princeton Tec hiking light which I absolutely adore. Advice: Look for a hiking lamp with the highest lumen number which indicates its brightness."
5,love this petzel,"this could be the best piece of hiking gear that I own. Used it recently on 3 day hike through Dolly Sods and had no problems. Great Battery life, very compact and low profile. I cannot recommend this enough. I love this thing"
2,Be Aware,"Be Aware that this is a kiddie book. This is not necessarily bad because it is easily read, only 30 some pages in large print, and might encourage some young reader to pursue more. However, Ms Gains also injects some of the typical academic liberal bias - e.g. Jefferson was not a ""Democratic Republican"" he was a Republican; the Federalists no more favored merchants than Jefferson and Monroe favored slave holding land owners. Not a particularly good book for an adult to get an objective sense of who Monroe was and what Monroe stood for."
4,Very Effective,"I have been practicing yoga, tai chi and qi gong for several years. I have found each to be effective in some way. However, I have found nothing that gives me ready energy any faster than following this Chan Mi Gong program. Often, in the morning I have time for only the first few movements, but they have always been sufficient to give me energy and positive motivation for the day. The only time I had trouble was once when I surpassed the recommended 5 minutes limit per movement that the author recommends. This gave me a feeling of high blood pressure and irritability for the entire day; I felt kind of like I was about to pop. I'll not do that again."
5,Excellent and lots of fun,"Equinox Zero is another excellent entry in the Outlanders series, this time featuring a lost race of Vikings under the polar ice cap.Lots of action and adventure in this one!Recommended!"
1,Lithium Ion Battery for Nokia 6010 and Various Others,"I ordered a Lithium Ion Battery for a Nokia 6010 Cell Phone. I received a box for a Lithium Ion Battery for a Nokia 6010 Cell Phone, but the battery inside the box was the wrong one. I returned it for the correct battery. I have heard nothing from you until now. I don't have any product to review, just what I consider lax service."
1,Worse than useless...,"Myro/ Magic American #MC15 7/8""x11' Bath Seal TrimThe only thing that would be magical about this product is if anyone that used it thought it worthwhile. It seemed to stick pretty well at first, but soon thereafter, the plastic (the angle piece) started coming off, leaving the sticky goo they call adhesive, [mostly] stuck to the surface. In other words, after thoroughly cleaning the surface, the ""adhesive"" sort of stuck to the surface, but not the plastic to the adhesive. Having given up, I peeled the plastic off pretty easily, but the adhesive didn't come off with it. The only way to get the sticky mess off the surface was with a scraper, and then with paint thinner when it was mostly gone. A 1 star rating is 6 stars too many for this terrible product."
5,Great overview of games and casinos in Vegas,"This is a great introduction to the games that you can play in Vegas, the odds that the house has on each game. There's also good information about almost every casino in Vegas -- what's good and bad about each one.Vinson has a nice writing style. He's humorous and informative.Get this book if you've never been to Vegas, or if you've only been there a few times. The only strike against this book is that it's a few years old (published in 1996, I think), and things to change."
5,Very Original,"Only their second cd, but it is great!! Good orignality and song writing. They are not getting the recognition they should be getting because thier genre is crowded with many talented groups. In a few years , DUELO will break away from the pack and be the one of the best if not the best just like INTOCABLE is right now."
1,Your mistake on your part!,Well you guys sent me the wrong cd to being with and now I'm going to have to pay for it. I missed the deadline to send the cd back and that's because I didn't have money to send it back due to the package and shipping and handeling. I figured it would almost come out to what I payed for initially.
5,Awesome compact luxury stroller,"I just purchased this stroller, and my husband and I both love it. I also own a Pliko P3, but had a few things I didnt like about it. Well I was worried I would be missing out on some of its features in switching to this one such as the very large hood, but it has that as well as the adjusting legrest (great for little babes). This stroller is sleek, compact and everything I expect from a Graco. You will not be disappointed. I will be back with more after more use (just got it today). :)"
3,"An ""ok"" stroller","I bought this as a travel system.What I like:*Compact and lightweight*Easy to maneuver*rides fairly nicelyDislike:*Cupholder NEVER got put on. I couldn't figure out how to make it stay, and then we lost it in the move!*With the carseat on top, I cannot get anything in or out of the basket.*Does not do well with any kind of bumps... like in the sidewalk."
4,Great for travel,"We love this stroller. My husband 5'7"" and I 5'5"" can both push it without hitting the wheels. It is light weight so I can travel with it and get it easily in and out of the car. It's easy to fold/unfold. It does great on paved roads - however it does not to well on gravel. Like another review mentioned - we can't get the cup holder to stay on either. And with the carseat in place it's very hard to get things in the basket. The color - mainly black - makes for a very hot baby on a warm, sunny day. None the less - we still love the stroller."
1,Avoid Delphi Skyfi 2,"Impossible to use anywhere near a city unless it is hard wired. Unlike its predecessors this unit doesn't play into the FM radio unless you can identify and tap into the FM ANTENNA that is in your car. It is equally useless in the home without a radio or stereo sytem that has RCA plugs. All in all its a bust compared to previously released units that you could plug in and play near any FM radio without any additional wiring. avoid this unit if you don't intend to have it professionally installed. That being said, nothing is bettter than XM radio."
5,Trip to Florida,"I purchased the XM Delphi and I drove to Florida and it made the trip so enjoyable, I can't wait to drive back. That is in a month. It is great. Highly recomend to any person who drives for a living as I do and for those who enjoy good music and great varity of other stuff. Can't say enough. Going to get the Radio attachment for my home in Florida."
1,Poor,I did not get what i order Bargians 4 U send the wrong item. The order paper that they send with the item was right but the item was wrong sent it back over 15 days ago and have not heard nothing from them so where is my stuff.
2,"Warning, Delphi will give you the third degree on warranty","Purchased Skyfi2 33 days ago. Skyfi2 quit working and I could not return it to the Store (seller) as it was over 30 days from sale. Called Delphi, for service and was given the third degree. Had to mail product back to service center and then wait for another to be mailed, over two week turn around. They were not friendly. Be careful."
1,Disappointed ... perhaps just a lemon,"I just returned my skyfi2 today after spending 3 days trying to get it to activate. It would receive the preview channel fine, but none of the other channels would show up - despite several attempts to ""reinitialize"" it either from the web or with tech support...The web site to sign up was also a bit of a pain (e-sales by Siebel is what they use looks like...) with several lockups and having to start over 4 times... perhaps that was part of the problem... either way it went back to Best Buy. Disappointing since all my friends tell me it is great... perhaps I'll give Sirius a try."
5,Delphi xm radio,"This is our second xm radio. My husband wanted it to take to the assisted living home. We both enjoy the music so much, especially at night before we go to sleep. The Skyfi 2 is excellent. It is so much easier to read the song titles and seems to come in better (it wasn't as hard to direct the satellite disc). We only listen to a couple of channels but really like them."
5,Super Radio,"The radio is great, I use the FM transmitter to send the signal to the radio in my Ford truck. The sound quality is super! I have been using it for over a year and have had no problems. Since I got satellite radio that's all I listen to!!"
4,For history buffs and would-be leaders,"If you're an American history buff (which I am), you will be engrossed in the analytical approach to the study of these generals' lives. If you're aspiring to a leadership position in ANY field of interest, it is a particularly interesting and informative read.Learning from the enduring legacy of these gentlemen/warriors, many contemporary lessons and revelations can be gained. Admirable qualities are timeless, after all.For the casual reader, however, it may prove to be dry-going."
1,Jon Atkinson,"We just received ours in the mail for my son's birthday. It didn't work, plugged it in and it started one stream and quit. Nothing else.sad toy. we will try another but probably from another company."
1,dont waist your money on something that wont do ya any good,i bought my plasma globe yesterday and today it is broken it is a total waist of money and i am highly apauled by this inexplicable malfunction so i am just putting up the warning sign for anyone who wants a plasma globe/ball dont waist your money on the 7'' Plasma Ball made by toys!!!!!!!!!
1,Didnt work,"Packaged well, but couldnt get it to work! Was excited to give this to my daughter for christmas, shes been wanting one for a couple of years....very disappointed!"
4,best toy,A great toy to have for young children.very educational I would recommend this toy for all parents with kids ages 5 and up
2,They do not last very long,"This will be the second Plasma ball I have ordered and it is the same problem. At first they work great, but then after a few days they begin to fade. The normal plasma discharge becomes faint and then after a while there is almost no reaction to the touch. I think if you simply do not use them except for shows and then only for a few minutes at a time they may be ok. It was just a Fad I was going though along with the Lava Lamps, and I am over that now. The Products do arrive quickly and they do work as promised at first. Not sure what I could have done to prolong the life."
5,Plasma ball review,"My son loves it and any other child who sees it, loves it too. It can keep them occupied for a good 30 minutes."
1,Didn't work,"It did not work, so we had to go to the hassle of sending it back! My daughter was really disappointed!!"
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.,If you are a short person then you might like this no frills chair. It sits very low at full height. It is kind of cheap looking but it works. I would pass on this one and spend a little more money and get a better chair.
3,My Sisters Keeper by Rachel Lindsay,"From Back Cover:Appearances can be deceiving...""I wouldn't go out with a sailor like you,"" Ella had said primly. ""I hate slumming!"" It sounded snobbish, but she had to discourage him somehow.The ""sailor"" proved to be Bertrand Scott, owner of a luxurious yacht, and one of Europe's most eligible millionaires. Ella was mortified when she discovered the truth. But strangely enough, her rude rejection had only made Scott more interested.To a man accustomed to easy conquests, Ella was definitely a challenge. ""Don't fight me, Ella,"" he said softly. ""When I want something, I always get it!"""
3,Gentle Version of Islamic Love,"It is a lovely book. I do not know how much it introduces us to the fantastic world of islamic palaces and way of thinking. At first, I was somewhat bored by the descriptions, but they soon were substituted by the felling of warmth and comfort, the climate of love among the main characters. The dedication of the Emir Hamid for his beloved Falco is dreamy. So is the recognition of this love by Falco. An impossible love, probably seen as some women must see love. As the story develops, however, the behavior of characters is so much predictable that one should say we are in a dream in which we command the next steps. Should it be real? Anyway, it is a fairly readble book, full of hopes, and some disillusionments, that attracts our attention to the world of the ""believers""."
4,born musician,"He does not only play Brouwers music...he feels Brouwer music.My opinion: not only the first recording of ""El Decameron negro""and ""Django Variations"", but the best untill now.In a few words: Oraison doesn`t play notes...he let them speak."
4,"Good product but marked up, Slow delivery","I had purchased the autograph ball for a member of my basketball team in plenty of time for it to arrive before it was needed.. It was to be given at the end-of-season party. The ball arrived the day after the party, and it had several marks in it. I didn't want the hassel of returning it and waiting for another ball that would probably be marked up too, and the star basketball player was expecting it. So, I gave the damaged ball to him a day late.It is a good product when it is in perfect condition, but just don't expect it to come through the delivery process in pristene condition."
3,"Item great,service not so good",The music is great but they sent me two and charged me postage on both as well. I asked for a mailing label to return one or some kind of response but got none. Will never order from these people again.
2,rip off!!!!!,"when i saw the picture of the fingerpick, i thought it was made of metal and it looked very sturdy, it turns out that the astute seller changed the lightings of the picture so that the pick would look like its actually worth 2 dollars, even though its a crappy piece of plastic that breaks easily. i spent 7 dollars on 4 picks that ended up snapping when i played, it also slides off easily so whenever i play, it gets stuck in my guitar. DONT BUY IT!"
2,Utterly unappealing mystery...,"Douglas Anderson's ""First and Ten"" is a hackneyed mystery, with the only interesting twist being that the sleuth is a pro football player. The revelations of how players act aren't unexpected, and the villian is fairly obvious, and we learn who he is early, although the hero is at first shocked to see how close the villian is to him. Then, they go to Texas to find the truth about a death from long ago that will tie everything together. Very unsympathetic to ""scrabs"" and fairweather fans."
5,The Great Buster Keaton,Any fan of Buster's will be thrilled with this DVD. Buster Keaton was the greatest of the Silent comedians. He was a world class athlete and does stunts that still amaze.
2,Not my favorite...,"I work in a professional kitchen and our tomato shark went missing, after 2 weeks of using my paring knife to core out a box of tomatoes a day I decided I would invest in my own. I like other Messermeister products so I picked up this one. The grip is comfortable.. If you are going to use this product make sure to hold your thumb on the metal behind the useful end. If it were me I would not get this product again."
1,REALLY DESERVES '0' STARS....,"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME and MONEY!!! Don't even bother purchasing this 'rack', as it will have you pulling your hair out (and your clothes on the floor in a heap....). The only part of this garment rack that is sturdy are the top steel bars (that the hangers hang from). The inventor of this item should be fired! Despite reassembling and even gluing the bottom 'supporting connector bars', the rack fell apart 3 times within the first day. Fun when you come home from work and clothes are on the floor and wrinkled.......I recommend you not even consider this item and save your money to purchase the commercial steel garment rack on this same site. I returned this item and purchased the other, and finally now know what 'getting your monies worth' really stands for. The other rack in indestructable, strong, and moves easily from room to room. If you purchase the commercial rack, you will love it and have it for many years !!!"
3,"Good for light storage, but assembly is lacking.","I bought this product hoping it would be useful to hang clothes as I am painting the closet and need to move them. I assembled it per instructions, but the instructions are lacking. They do not tell you that the bottons on the adjustable poles need to be pushed in in order to get them to go in. They also claim that no tools are needed to assemble their product. This may be true is you are a man or woman with incredible arm strength. Otherwise, I would recommend at least a rubber mallet for the bottom part. I put it together without a hammer at first and it fell apart before I had even half of my clothes put on it. It seems to be holding up now that the hammer was used, but it's still questionable. Will use it for light use after this, but would never recommend it for a permanent fix for hanging clothes."
1,Doesn't hold up,"This rack was easy to assemble, but does not stay together well. As soon as I hung clothing on it, it began to collapse...and don't even think about rolling it with clothing on it. The rods on the bottom do not stay in."
1,Don't do this to yourself.,I did finally get it put together. At first the support rods on the bottom kept falling out (once I had the whole thing assembled and tried to move it.) Finally got it together and hung clothes on it. It leaned at a 45 degree angle when loaded (sideways) only because I caught it. So have it wedged between my desk and some heavy full suitcases so it stands upright with clothes on it. Of course. I can't sit at my desk without my shoulder hitting a suit but it does have clothes on it. On here researching something suitable to buy. Do not buy this for yourself. Do not buy it for someone else (unless you do not like the other person)
1,"If there were a ""zero-stars"" option...","If there were a ""zero-stars"" option...that's what I'd give this product. One thing I can say about this product: it's consistent. It breaks at the cheap plastic base. I didn't overload it either. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Piece of Junk,"Waste of money!!!! As another review mentioned, the bottom half of the frame is plastic, while the top half is metal. So, after a few hours of clothing weight the bottom snaps apart and into pieces. The design of this product is awful."
1,notice there's no warantee,"I had an identical with a different part number.Notice they don't offer a warranty timeframe.After 8 months, the plastic connectors broke, and all my clothes fell to the floor.They offer a 3 month warranty (!!!!) -- IMHO unheard of in this residential application.They offered to ""sell"" me new connectors -- I'm going to throw it out and buy a real rack."
1,"Flimsy, fell apart after only 3 months","This rack is extremely top heavy. The bottom supporting bars will not stay together, even when super-glued. There is no way this product could support the amount of clothes it has space for, so why tease me with so many adjustable options? Fell apart after only 3 months. Lasted another 2 weeks after the super glue. Next time I am definitely going for a more expensive rack, and not a Whitmor!"
1,Whitmor Ebony Chrome Adjustable Garment Rack,"I don't know why I didn't read the reviews - I always read and appreciate seeing what other customers have to say about the product - but no, not this time! And I really got burned!!!! This is a piece of junk. I purchased it earlier and assembled it, which went fine until I hung clothes on it -- then it didn't hold up five minutes. What a waste of money:-("
3,"Good for the price, not very sturdy.","This product is very easy to put together and is great for lighter things. Has a tendacy to sway and tip over if you put heavier items on it. Keep it very light and you will ove this rack for the low price, but if you want soemthing that functions for actual storage of a significant amount of clothing: keep looking!"
4,Purple Gets Fun-Kay,"When Deep Purple replace their singer and vocalist for the second time with David Coverdale and Glen Hughes, they started to get a funkier direction than the driving, heavy, classical-infused Gillan/Glover days. And, for me, it was patchy - there's some great stuff on ""Burn"" and ""Stormbringer"", but also a lot of stuff that doesn't completely work for me. When Blackmore left and they replaced him with Tommy Bolin for this album, it all seemed to fall into place again. This album is consistently good funk (and soul) infused hard rock, and it works! It definitely has more of a dated/of-its-time sound than the classic sound of the early 70's Purple, but that kind of adds to it's charm. Definitely one of my favorite post-Machine Head albums by the band. I'm not a big fan of straight-ahead funk and soul, but this has a enough hard rock kick to make it work for me. If you like the late-70's work of Uriah Heep or early Whitesnake, this should go over well."
4,not bad at all,"i orignially told myself i would never listen to this album considering it didn't have ritchie blackmore on it but i finally did get it and i was wrong. tommy bolin is indeed a worthy replacement. this is defintiely my favorite out of the david coverdale albums as this is almost completely composed of rockers except for the last track(stormbringer had too many ballads that didn't go anywhere). this isn't by any means as good as ""in rock"" or ""machine head"" but if you are a hardcore deep purple fan i would definitely check this out."
4,yes and no,"When I bought this album in Nov. '75 I loved it instantly, it had really transformed into new writers and a new band. I like to think of it as the only Purple 'Summer' album, unlike say In Rock. It has a terrific Jazz bass sound and the best drum sound Ian Paice had recorded, yet it was definitely his sound. Disc 2 of this pack, while fixing the rusty guitar sound loses the presence on the bass and drums. As if a very light blanket was placed over them. The drums and bass sound are more say, anybody's. The 2 quiet passages in You Keep on Moving do not have 2 only distinct Coverdale and Hughes vocals singing harmony in stereo separation but many vocal tracks mainly dominated by Hughes parts. This was also a great outro album track. Disc one is great as was the earlier remaster release, but not as big a sound and image as say a moving coil to disc transfer from Jap. or German vinyl."
5,Great!!!,"What we have here is five very tallented musicians who are free to create to their utmost without being dominated by the great Ritchie Blackmore. This entire record is so good I can't stop playing it. I was already a Glenn Hughes fan and a Tommy Bolin fan. To have them both in a great band like Deep Purple was a gift from God. At least for me because this is my kind of music. If you appreciate real classic rock by musicians who have mastered their instruments (unlike the monkey asses you hear on the radio nowadays) then listen, as I did, to the reviewers on this page and make this CD a part of your collection. More than likely, after the last song plays, you will push the play button again. And again, and again...It's just that good. Trust me."
4,Bolin shines,"As Tommy Bolin fans know he was a great guitarist who could write a good song and had a unique voice that conveyed a real passion and depth of feeling. This guy would have been putting out more music that would have given him more fame & respect than just his short time with DP. This album stands alongside the 2 he did with the James Gang (Bang and Miami). This is an underated album by those morons who think Ritchie Blackmore was the only one worthy of playing guitar for DP. Tommy was a good choice and now they have the best in Steve Morse. If you like the David Coverdale/Glenn Hughes DP period then get this album but please check out all the Tommy Bolin stuff, he was awesome most of the time. RIP."
5,come taste the band ....rocks!,"people, this is a great album...it has much better sound and punch than all previous editions. crank it up and see for yourself!"
1,DP's worst album ever!,"This is dp's worst album, NOT because Ritchie isn't here, NOT because Gillan isn't here, BUT because it's not any kind of hard rock. CTTB is really shame after Machine Head and even after Burn.However Stormbringer was also weak, more funky than hard rock, but Come Taste The Band is soul-funky album! Tommy Bolin was great guitarist, Coverdale is really good vocalist and Hughes had really good vocal range, BUT they weren't the proper people for Deep Purple - They are sunky-soul musicians, and that was the reason why DP died in 1976.I'M NOT GOING TO LISTEN !SOUL! ALBUM FROM BOGUS DEEP PURPLE.if you are hard rock/metal fan, CTTB isn't worth to listen it even for 1 times.If you are a died fan of Tony Braxton or Whitney Houston, Than, This album is only for you!"
4,Kevin Shirley,"I read somewhere that Glenn Hughes feels the Kevin Shirley remixes give the true artist's vision of the songs. I really love Glenn but I find the remixes are subpar in every way to Disk 1/Original versions of the songs.Disk 1 is the CTTB release and its great. On both records, the extra songs are great too and nicely compliment Days May Come and other such releases. I personally love CTTB. It's a great record, period. Deep Purple or otherwise."
3,Good fan,"It shipped in its original box which was damaged, fan was luckily OK. Fan is kind of unsteady on such a small base. Other than that it is fine."
3,small fan,"This fan is small. I would not have bought it if I had seen it on a shelf beside other fans. I have a tall bed and am concerned about how much air I will be able to feel from this fan. At the moment I am using this for white noise as it is winter. On the lowest speed the fan is almost silent so I have to turn it up to the medium speed. And it has a green light that glows in the dark when the fan is on. It glows enough to light up the ceiling above the fan. This was very irritating the first night. I have now covered this light with several layers of masking tape. My other fans have had red lights that were hardly noticeable at night. Due to this glowing green light and the small size, I can only give this fan a 3."
3,"Cheap product, great customer service!","UPDATE: 11/21/12- I originally gave this a 1 star review but i am back 2 days later to bump it up to 3 for great customer service. I called customer support and they didn't have any of this model left in stock so they sent me a totally different brand and model fan of equal or great value with the exact same features if not more. I don't know what it is yet because its on it way but if i remember to update this when i get it in the mail ill update again.I bought this fan but knew i was buying a cheap product. About a month after i bought it, the fan all-together stopped oscillating. When i press the buttons to select which mode, the oscillating mode doesn't even light up. Its cheap looking, cheap feeling, and it wobbles way too much.. it barely stands up by itself. Don't buy this trust me, the 5 star reviews are from people that used it for a week and rated it, use it for more than a month and you will be on here rating it 1 star to save other helpless souls."
5,Wonderful!!,Amazon was great! I ordered it and 4 days later I had the fan! Super easy to put together and it keeps my room nice and cold during hot summers and a beautiful breeze in the winters! I especially like the sleep mode that stay quiet at night so we can sleep!
3,ok tower fan,"this tower fan is ok for the price. wind is strong keep me cooled off all day long. however, downside is that it is a little bit noisy"
2,Rattles,This fan started out ok but it's very unstable and wobbly. After having it for a few months it started to make this awful loud rattling noise that I could never find the source of. Decent for short time use but I'm having a much better experience with the new Honeywell I picked up.
1,Check packages quickly,"I received the fan during the fall, so I didn't open it until spring. One piece of the tower was missing leaving a useless fan. Over 90 days after ordering so company refused replacement. Always cherk package on arrival!!!"
4,Fan,"Good fan, nice options, wish I could turn the beeping off though that happens every time you change a setting, also, the tower seems to be a little rickety, but I think that's a design issue with tower fans (top heavy). Nice sound, not too loud for living room or too quiet for white noise at night. Good breeze, easy to put together and easy to use, my 2 year old loves the remote. :/"
3,Worth the price missing small parts,First let me say there was a small part missing. And that is the part at the bottom to keep the cord in one place. Not a biggie but I would hate the cord being ruined because I moved back in with my family and my mother loves touching and moving other peoples things.The unit has a nice place where you can put the remote so you do not lose it. It has nice and decent settings. Basically it does its job
1,OK if you only need it for a few months,"I had product only a few months when it started making a clicking noise randomly. It got louder and more frequent as time went on and even woke us up at night. Then after about 6 months, it sounded like a piece broke off and it sparks flew and it died. Now its trash. Don't buy it."
2,Too Loud,"I have previously owned 2 of these fans. The quality of the ones I purchased 4 years ago is superior to the ones made now. I moved and somehow lost the two old fans so I needed a new one. I bought this for my bedroom and it made this annoying rattling sound. It was so loud I could hear it downstairs, so I returned the fan."
1,worst service,DO NOT BUY THIS FAN. THERE IS NO WARRANTY SERVICE. HOLMES SERVICE REP CLAIMS THEY DON'T WARRANTY THE REMOTE BUT THE WARRANTY DOES NOT STATE THAT. SIX MONTHS INTO A 2 YEAR WARRANTY AND THE REMOTE DIES. YOU WILL NOT GET IT FIXED OR REPLACED - PERIOD. THE REP TOLD ME THEY DON'T MAKE THE REMOTE ANYMORE. TRY AND FIND A REPLACEMENT REMOTE ONLINE-NOTHING. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST COMPANIES i'VE EVER DEALT WITH.
1,Junk - You get what you pay for.,"Our office ordered two of these fans. One didn't work right out of the box. Had to return it for another one. Now, about 1 year later, both the replacement fan and the second one completely broke down and stopped working. So, that's 3 fans broken in less than a year. They did not receive very heavy use either. Only used for a short while when it was extremely hot. Can't be trusted - look somewhere else."
4,Enjoyable read,"This book moved at a good pace, lots of laughs and a nice light read, easy to devour in one day."
2,Get something else,Smells nice for 2 hours after treatment and then you have stinky A/C again. Good enough?
3,Crunched...but I guess taste the same,I bought these to feed to my pet hedgehog and was sad to see that when they came they were really crunched and smushed. They must still taste alright because he ate them regardless ;-)
4,Works in a pinch,"My pacman (ornate horned) frog will eat these in a pinch if we can't get him any food. I find though that it's best to let them soak in water for a little bit first, otherwise they're too crunchy and he'll spit them out."
5,Sugar Gliders LOOOVE these!,"My daughter's two sugar gliders just looove these little things. I love not having live cricket sacrifices going on in my basement daily.Only issue, Sarah's sugar gliders pull the little legs off and leave them in the food bowl. Not bad, just weird."
1,Freeze dried Fluker's cricket MADE IN CHINA-beware!!,"Freeze dried crickets MADE IN CHINA. I love this product until I noticed the fine print-MADE IN CHINA. Considering all the recalls China is so famous for, you really don't know what they put in these crickets. These ARE whole crickets, and if you stick them in running water and squish them a bit they soften up quickly. My only problem is that it is MADE IN CHINA. I threw the crickets away.I am going to buy my own food processor and make my own freeze dried crickets. Simply because I don't trust anything China puts out.PS-you better be careful what kind of candy you buy-some were made in China like Hanna Montana candies-look at the label if you don't believe me."
2,Please Don't....,"Please don't buy this album. Go out and get the CDs that the songs are featured from. Deep Purple Compilation albums are pretty awful, mostly encompasing the same tunes , more or less. This album is very similar to ""When We Rock, We Roll & When we Roll, We Roll"" get a remasterd copy of this instead...Better song collection. I really do feel strongly about buying ""In Rock"", ""Fireball"" and ""Machine Head. if you happen to like I an Gillan's Voice. As A Second thought try Made in Japan...a brilliant Live Album covering their songs up to Machine Head, that is classic Purple"
4,Set the controls for 1975,"I get a kick out of this album. Put it in your stereo, and suddenly you're in the parking lot behind your suburban high school in 1975, smoking cigarettes with your friends beside a pickup truck while cutting algebra class. Doesn't matter what age you actually are, this album transports you directly to that point in space-time. It's uncanny.I'm not a collector of DP's material, but as a casual fan this disc was a good investment and seems to cover all the hits. If you're interested in checking out this band, this disc is definitely a good starting point."
4,Nice recording,"Brought back memories of High School! Only remembered a few songs such as ""Smoke on the water"", and ""Hush"". Had not listened to the other songs, or if I did I did not remember. I did have the vinyl album at one point. Now I remember that I really did not like the other songs that much. If you are not keen on having the rest of the songs, you may be better off getting the MP3's of the songs that you like."
4,Deep Purple has a greatest hits too...,"This album is truely one amazing album. This was the first album I bought by Deep Purple. I heard about 3 or 4 songs by them so I picked this album up. It was a good idea I did, because I really enjoy it. The almighty song ""Smoke On The Water"", is on here. Although, I like a lot of songs on here better than that song. If you have never listened to Deep Purple, but you have been curious of what they sound like, pick up this album, it's great to start with and includes all of the smash hits you have heard on the radio, including others you haven't heard..."
3,A tale of two concerts,"For whatever reason, the footage of the Copenhagen concert rarely shows Ritchie Blackmore playing, even during his intros or solos. Somebody needs to track that cameraman down and slap him silly. The New York concert footage is better, but the majoity of the tracks on this DVD come from the Copenhagen show. Overall this DVD is a disappointment, enjoyable sometimes, but a disappointment nonetheless."
3,Okay,Smoke on the water is an awesome awesome song. The rest of the collection is okay. Somewhat rockin' but bland.
2,Jag snob,"I bought it for 'Hush' as I like the Jaguar ad running for the XF, and I own a Jag. Only four good songs on the CD; Hush, Smoke on the Water, My Woman from Tokyo, and Kentucky Woman. The rest are pretty weak. Unless you own a Jag, don't buy it."
2,Not a great album,"Thought this would be a great album but only a few good cuts here that sound good today.Save your money. Go get some Skynard, Bad Company, Led Zep or Hendrix instead!"
5,Classic Purple!,"Classic Purple!If you've never heard it, you're in for a treat.If you want to hear 21st century Deep Purple,order their new album Bananas (Oct. 7, 2003),you're also in for a treat.God bless DP!"
3,"Another Blown G.H. Disc! (where's ""Perfect Strangers"")","There will almost always be disagreements regarding track selection on Greatest Hits compilations. But come on Record Labels, obvious ommissions are totally unacceptable! Know the artist. Do your research. Check the Billborad charts (Hmmm, this is a Rock band, I guess it would make sense to check out Billboards ""Rock Tracks"" chart.). How can ""Perfect Strangers"" not be on this Deep Purple Greatest Hits disc. With ommisions like this, it makes you wonder if the compiler ever listened to the radio or has a clue about the band. The disc would rate 5 Stars with the inclusion of Perfect Stangers. But I have no resevations about downgrading the rank to 3 because of such an obvious oversight. I expect more from the record labels, and especially Rhino Records."
5,high quality product with good price,"These are high quality product Made in Japan. Installation was eazy, it comes with everything NEW to make your installation easy. I like the product, easy installation, fit good and good price. I know this will be the last set I install on the car."
1,Crapped Out after Two Months,"Worked great until it just quit. Nothing out of it at all except a noisy buzz. Appears that the microprocessor has failed entirely. Even though it has a ""limited 5 year warranty"", the warranty is, in effect, useless. Manufacturer requires unit to be sent to them ( $22 UPS ) at my expense AND, if they repair or replace it, I have to pay for the return shipping. Shoot, may be around $44 both ways for shipping and I can buy a more highly rated bulk deep-cycle battery charger/maintainer from Amazon for just $47. No brainer. Dump the Shumacher and vow to stay away from their brand."
2,Not worth it,"I have a v6 4wd toyota highlander. The battery went bad and I wished that this charger could recharge the battery for some time. First of all, the unit cannot even jump start my highlander. It always starts blinking when recharging reaches about 60%."
3,"Sophisticated charger, but...","This charger works well, in general, but its built-in computer seems to want to end the charging process prematurely, particularly for my deep-cycle batteries! It would nice to have more control over the process of charging deep-cycle batteries...It does NOT get along well with my generator (we are off-grid), as it seems to be very sensitive to the frequency of its power source, and will shut itself off if the generator's frequency deviates too much from 60 Hz!"
5,wipe and clean on AR coatings in glasses,Used this product on anti reflective coatings on my glasses with no adverse effects. It didnt cause any scratches on the lens surfaces.
1,Half are Dry,Almost half of the lens wipes that I open are dry and completely useless. I will never purchase these again.
2,Not a good product,"I don't like this product at all. Bought it once and won't buy it ever again. In the future, I'll buy Bausch & Lomb's Sight Savers, which I found to be much better at cleaning my glasses and the computer monitor."
1,JWEST,"THIS WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE PLAY I EVER SAW, IT JUST WASN'T A TYLER PERRY STAGE PLAY. FIRST I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THIS PLAY TO COME THREW THE MAIL, BUT DAWN WHEN IT CAME AND I WATCH IT MY MOUTH DROP! LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME, THE SINGERS WHERE HORRIABLE EVEN JOHNNY GIL EVEN QUACK, I'M LIKE WAT THE HICK IS GOING ON WITH THIS PLAY, I WISH I CAN SEND IT BACK TO GET MY MONEY BACK IF I COULD IT WOULD GO BACK EXPRESS MAIL TO THE SENDER. SHIRLEY MURDOCK WAS THE BEST SINGER OUT THE BUNCH."
2,A Mother's Prayer,"The play was okay. I lost interest in some parts. It ended well but wasn't great. ""When the light goes off"" was better."
4,A Mother's Prayer Review,"I was very excited to see this play because I had heard so many great things about it. When I finally got to see it, it I found out that all the good things I had heard were very true. The acting was very good. One scene that really stuck out to me was when the daughter had left home and was strung out on drugs. I was actually surprised @ the realness of that scene! And when Robin Givens (mother) became ill she did an excellent job portraying her condition. But the songs were great and the singing was off the hook! I'm looking foward to seeing more of these productions in the future :)"
3,A MOTHER'S PRAYER,"IT WAS GOOD, THE GRANDFATHER WAS FUNNY BUT THEY COULD HAVE USED A REAL OLDER PERSON, I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF QUALIFIED OLDER ACTORS OUT THERE THAT COULD HAVE DONE THE PART MORE JUSTICE. JOHNNY GILL SANG VERY WELL"
3,A Mother's Prayer reveiw,"this play had some good parts, but it seemed rushed, and half written, Robin givens did'nt have much of a part in here,the child actors in a mothers prayer were good!"
3,Leona,"This is a very sad movie. When I saw the title I thought of the many times I prayed for the safety of my kids, and pre-judged the movie to be similar to that, but it turned out different. It's a good movie, just too sad for me."
1,NOT SO MUCH,"I watch a lot of plays and will continue to venture threw all of them, but this one here was OMG the worst. Long, drawn out, and just boring. oh well, they can't all be great."
2,Pray harder,"The message is powerful. However, the actors did not portray the story well at all. I was dissapointed and wish I could return it."
2,Blinded by jargon,"I'll tell you right away, I didn't read this entire book. In fact I only browsed it. I was put off by the first half of the book which disses just about every other flavor of Six Sigma out there. Of course, this book tells you the *right* way to do it. As to jargon: on page 332 he uses the acronym NOAC (next operation as customer). Then he goes on to talk about it for two pages without ever really defining it. You see, he's a professional. Don't try this at home.If you need a cook book and love jargon, this is the book for you."
1,Horrible,"I have four children, and have read quite a few childrens' books. I have rarely read a book that didn't have some redeeming qualities but, really, this has almost none. It's at least 2 edits away from completion. The language is so overwrought at times that it's silly. Is the author making some sort of strange theological point? Is it an effort to paint a picture of individual oddity? Not charming. Not provocative. Not well-written. It's simply weird. Not even weird-good like Sendak or Silverstein -- just weird-bad. Don't waste your time or money."
3,knife constuction,The handle meeting the blade has play in it making it unsafe andundependable for any type real outdoor use.Good only for display or good show piece.
2,nice to look at but no good to use,I bought one a while back. The Blade is not very sharp for starters and needs much work to get it sharp.BUT the handle sucks. Once I reground the blade I actually used it camping and hiking. After using it to chop branches and the like the handle began to wiggle about. On checking it out I found that it was held on the the hilt with a small screw and GLUED in place. I ended up dumping the knife and got THE REAL THING. Now this was in 1995 and I ended up in Arkansas and bought the real knife from the makers of the knives in the movie. It at the time was a $800.00 knife. All hand made etc and very strong. Held up very well and now sits in a case on the wall. You do get what you pay for.
5,Seiko Women's watch,"Beautiful, well made. Another great Seiko product. I have several Seilko' watches consider them one of the top watch makers."
5,bold money,arived in good condition i dont know what else to say its a book and its in good shape thanks
2,I'm surprised....,"I was a fan of the show until it disappeared from tv. I was hoping for this book to be helpfull, and I read the other review. I even paid extra for quick shipping. But I was very disapointed in my buy. The book was less of a helpfull guide to cleaning and more of just a book. Sure, it's funny. It's written by Mary Ellen! She's hilarious! But the book is less of a guide; it doesn't have a clear set of examples and rules. I was hoping for something more like a thesarus. Something I could I use to look up what I wanted to know and have my information. This book you have to read it from cover to cover to get any information, and then, you are not guaranteed to find out what you want to know."
3,3d image maker indian,anyone have any information on where i can purchase this product i heard good thing about it thanks
2,What it is.,I do not own this product...But I have seen it in stores and can tell you what it is.do you know those stone head busts at Disneyland's Haunted Mantion?the ones you see while you're waiting in line once you get out of the elevator?This toy is suppose to be like those...except it doesn't work as well.It's suppose to look as though it's gaze is following you when you view it from different angles.It might work better in a dark room though...since it is lighted.
5,last but best,This is the last cd from Hot Cross as the band broke up in July 2007. Their sound is a little different than what was to be found on Cyronics possibly due to the losing one of two guitar players. There`s a bit more melody and dare I say singing on this disc. In my opinion this last album has some of their best songs ever released. Get this album and you won`t be let down.
1,A head cleaner for data tape was sent to me instead of a Video Head Cleaner,"The tape I received is for a Data Tape head cleaner. Not a Video Head cleaner. I did not know that data tape is used anymore by anybody when you can get (Random Access) Disk Drives for 10 cents per Gig.I think the person who sold it to me has some left over supplies from the early 1990s and he think he saw the chance to get rid of some, so he jump to the order. The order was for a Sony V8 8mm tape head Cleaner. I thought the ""V"" in V8 was for Video"
5,Hi8 Cleaner: Good!,Came in after 4 days waiting at regular mail. UPS was smart enough to send it through regular mail. Then after 2 runs through my camcorder I could see the recordings I made like a charm!
5,hidden treasure,"Such wonderful music makes it very difficult for me to understand the obscurity of this versatile acoustic guitarist.His licks are delivered in an impeccable style accompanied by a streaming lyrical narrative, reminiscent of the best of the folk/blues performers.It is hard to do justice in words to such great sounds....Pete is hidden treasure; cryptic and mysterious...laying down solid licks on all the tracks."
2,Not as described in Grizzly literature,"I've used this thing daily for about 6 months now. Thin, flimsy sheet metal construction (the area around the impeller is bent around every screw). Welded metal impeller (Will cause sparks if any metal hits it- dangerous). Leaks dust like crazy. Cheap, imported 220 Volt motor (FYI- USA is either 240 Volt single phase OR 208 Volt 3 Phase, period). If you must buy a low cost unit, look at the JET (that has an alloy impeller and better construction). I doubt that the 2.5 micro figure on the bag is anywhere close to accurate. Not a whole lot of suction, even with a single, short 4"" hose. I am buying a proper USA made 3 HP Oneida unit next, as cheaper in this case is false economy."
5,First & Best,"I think first films are sometimes the best. The shared joy of discovery - the same thing can never quite happen again. I think Tarrantino's Reservoir Dogs is hard to beat. Spike Lee has made lots of good films, however in my mind, ""She's Gotta Have It"" was the most wonderful & rare. Nola Darling absolutely a goddess! A funny film! All these years later I can still visualize Thanksgiving dinner with the older gentlemanly boyfriend candidate slicing meat for the other guys about the size of a quarter."
4,Spike Lee's first movie.,"The first thing you will notice that makes this movie special isthat is shot in black & white. It is the story of three men vyingfor the attention and affection of 1 woman. As the story unfoldsit's a question of ""Who's Zoomin Who"" And who if anybody will ride the ""Freeway Of Love"". This is not a typical date movie,but if you choose to watch it with you main squeeze. Don't scratch where it don't itch. In other words, you could wonder where they are and who they're with when their not with you.But don't ask. This was Spike debut as actor and director.For a movie made on a shoestring budget,the plot, though slow attimes, kept me interested."
3,no extras !!!!!!!!,"i just bought Shes gotta have it. I am very glad its on dvd finally but i feel cheated,it has no extras. How hard would it be to put some extras not even a frickin commentary or trailer. Spike stop being cheap and have the video companies hook up your movies with some extras. documentary, commentary, deleted scenes, maybe a rare short film. Video companies how bout a comprehensive collection of the mans films something with a scholarly approach like criterion did Do The Right Thing"
4,I've gotta have it,"Yo Spike, you've gotta be kidding what's the hold up. Can ya help a brother out and see what you can do to put your (baby) on DVD. This is a high crime. This movie was (is) a straigh-up winner. I heard that you didn't particularly like it, but we your fans think it's great. Sometimes the man in the mirror is blinded by the new kids on his block. Your other films are great also, but this one has its own place in history. Great script, great acting, the whole enchilada. Please do the right thing and help me and others complete or DVD collection. Thanks"
1,A WEAK SPIKE LEE JOINT,"First off, I would only recommend buying this film if you've already seen it. I have not seen a lot of Spike Lee stuff. Recently bought 'Do the Right Thing' and watched 'He Got Game'. Both Excellent. Especially 'Do the Right Thing'. So I picked this up as it's Spike Lee's first film. Can't go wrong, right? Wrong.First it's Black and White. Fr the most part. Not a problem, but I did not notice this until I was watching the movie. Second, the acting is just average at best. I don't wanna say bad, so that's the best it'll get. Third, the story is so basic that all you've got is the acting, which as mentioned it is not good.So if you know the movie and want it, that's fine. Picture quality was fine, no skipping, no noticeable bugs, and I did not look at the extras given my disappointment with the film. I am going to unload this first chance I get."
4,Great movie!!,"This film's message challenges people's perspectives on gender bias, double standards, and obviously sex.Another vintage and classic Spike Lee joint!"
4,You've gotta have it.,"If you have the Spike Lee joint Collection and Malcolm X, you need to get this one too if you want all of his good early films. Parts of this movie can be viewed many times. For example, the scene that's in color. The sex scenes are very unique. It's better than Scorsese's first film, ""Who's That Knocking on My Door"", also in black and white and low budget. It still surprises me that a male wrote this movie. To sum it up- great art film. It should have been a cult classic."
4,Resurrected to DVD. Wow!,"Spike! Now that you've brought this classic up to the Y2K era, how about a sequel? I mean, really! John Canada Terrell and Tracy Camilla Johns reunited. (heck, they even have the same initials) How would Greer feel when he runs into Nola again after 20+ years? Will he still love her or did he get his fill of white girls. Will he try to get revenge? (pretending to fall in love with her only to lead her on). So many questions that makes the appetite of your average movie view grow. I think you should find Ms. Johns and ask her to do a sequel. She's gotta be around somewhere!!! Anyway, I saw this movie way back in the day and loved it. I do believe the 2 of them (JCT and TCJ) sort of have that Billy Dee Williams/Diana Ross connection. They play well together. Think about it, Spike. Seriously! You'd really do something if you reunited them.Much luv brotha!"
1,After this Album...,"It's fair to say that U-God was the worst member in the Wu Tang Clan..this album would have been alright if it was released in 1995 but it's 2004...and it's a just boring and tiresome, I don;t get how U God has had 2 very poor solo albums, yet Masta Killa hasnt had the one (yet). Avoid"
3,Mixed opinions on this one,"How can I say this and make sense? Alright, U-God has the commanding voice and rhyming skills, no doubt; and I do like these obscure beats on this joint; but the two just do not mix to make a hot CD. These beats I could hear on an electronica CD, but not really a hip hop CD. Songs like Lean Like Me, and Chippin & Chop It are crazy beats, but it just does not work with him. I mean I like it, but I don't like it. See, I made no sense at all. lol"
4,hillside scramblers,"i gave this cd 4 out of 5 stars , only thing it missed was an apperence by the rza. cd had hot beats."
4,Ugodz back in da game,"The best Wu-Title since the last year. He created a new type of wu-Sound. If you like the wu-style, you have to buy it"
3,Not her best but not bad at all,"Marion Chesney always seems to have a her tongue firmly in her cheek when she writes her Regencies, thus I find her a refreshing change. I liked both of the main characters in this book. The hero was something of a mystery, but I think that was needful for the rest of the plot. Very fun to read."
2,A few good chapters,"This book contains a few good chapters, but overall it was lacking in philosophical and critical content. Many of the chapters present a ""case-study"" method of ethical inquiry by presenting the reader with stories about this issue in the lives of people. Although a few chapters make some good points, it seemed to miss out on some key issues or only briefly touch upon those issues."
4,product exellent-----company does not stand behind rebate policy,"Highly disatisfied with veiw-sonic saysmy purchase did not fall within the dates of thier offer. After hours of comparing prices offered I specifically chose thier offer. Amazon should not sell for them, in my opinon. Thankyou for the opportunity to rate them."
2,Better options for the price,"If you're looking for a basic monitor, this is a good choice. The picture is sharp and operation is color free. It's relatively inexpensive. But, you can likely find a more up-to-date option at the same or nearly the same price.The VA1903wb is not a good choice if you're looking for a second monitor or for an external monitor for a laptop. It lacks a DVI input port, a feature standard on current lcd displays, which may limit your ability to hook it up.Also, the stand that accompanies the monitor is, in a word: cheap. It's short and unadjustable, so if you're tall and using the monitor on a desk or table you may have to put a thick book or the like underneath it to bring it up to a comfprtable eye level. Worse, the monitor is incapable of being rotated to portrait/page display - there's simply no option to attach the stand in any but the standard landscape orientation."
4,Definitive Jux (4.5 starz),"Def Jux is simply one of the best labels out there right now for independent hip hop. With great artists such as Mr. Lif, Murs, Aesop, C-Rayz, El-p, Cannibal Ox and Rjd2, th line up is very solid and looks very promising for the future of underground hip hop."
2,Misleading Amazon Description,The product is an 8 oz Denorex bottle that has 50% more free. You receive a bottle of 12 oz in total. This was not clear from the ad. Plus the price of the item is more like a 12 oz price.
1,Beware.....not as pictured,"It was my error..I thought you received an additional 12 oz bottle. In my opinion, this is false advertising.I am not commenting on the product, I have not yet try it. Just on the sellers portrayal."
1,Made it Worse,My head itched and burned until I washed my hair again with real shampoo Selsun Blue is much much better
1,didn't even work,Whoever had sent me this game did something to it cause it came completely flawless with no scratches and the case was perfect but yet it wouldn't work. rip off
1,Xbox Freeplay Wireless Controller Review,This wireless controller is not of sufficient quality to handle daily use for a very long period of time.
3,Xbox Freeplay Wireless Controller,"The controller seems to ""cut out"" or lock up while playing even though the batteries are fresh and it is clearly connected to the Xbox. It's not as good as the wired controller."
2,never buy again,bought for my husabdn birthday they locked up in us ended up returning them haven't have replaced them since.
4,A simple book for basic studies on philosophy,I bought this book and also Philosophy : The Basics by Nigel Warburton. I needed a revision guide as I was taking my mature student A level Philosophy course in 2000 and I think it was the best book for this level at that time for me. I did pass my exam so the books did their jobs. The books were well summarized and I can imagine that Nigel Warburton is a popular and good teacher on philosophy. It would be a safe book to buy if you want a quick look into important topics of some of the great philosophers.
4,"A great entry point, but a little too thin","I bought this book for a one-stop reference to the great western philosophers, and I was not disappointed. I enjoyed being able to spend 10 minutes brushing up on Hobbes, Kant, etc. But I think 20 minutes would have been better. Warburton does a great job in these little snippets, but that's all they really are: snippets. I can almost sense him, in many entries, running out of space and time and falling into oversimplification, slapping his hands together and saying, ""OK then, moving on ...""He could have made the book about 50 pages longer and gotten a tiny bit more in-depth. Still, it's a worthwhile purchase."
5,Pretty Good Moose...,"I really love the detail on your product, very nice, very pretty and very well done. Good job."
5,Bandit new Moose II,This one was so cut too that we ordered our Dog Bandit another one for when the other one gets dirty and in the wash. That way he always has his moosie with him all the time. Good quality.
4,"easy to understand, generally","My husband and I are thinking of buying our first home. We bought this book based on other reviews. I was quite pleased by the book. It's well-laid out. It really takes one through the steps of thinking about buying a home. Generally, I found the text to be concise and easy to understand. It's a great overview for someone who is not a realty / mortgage expert. There were a few passages that were a little hard to understand on the first pass, but nothing that could be remedied by getting out a pen and paper and trying the calculations for yourself.Overall, a great easy to read guide to home buying."
4,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,This edition is far superior to the first. Descriptions of pulse sequences are easily understood and the diagrams are very useful. Folks that like Peggy Woodwards' book will find this one very similar.It's worth the price for technologists studying for the national registry or just looking for a better understanding of MRI
2,Book is missing pages,"This book isnt that great first of all, and its missing pages from 371-378 and pages 395 to 402, i dont know how amazon can sell a book with missing pages"
3,Schwinn Bicycle Helmet,"The color and design were really cool, but the padding was VERY thin. It was a very large size helmet for being for kids. I had to use spare pads from other helmets my mom had or it would not have fit! There were no spare/thicker pads sent with the helmet."
1,beware,"I bought this grinder a little over a year ago. It just started making a clunking noise. I grind about 10 pounds of chicken a month. I called the manufacturer and they told me it has been discontinued and parts are not being made anymore. Stay away from this grinder. For the price it is a piece of junk. The manufacturer also said that stores are able to keep selling this product, however my local kitchen store does not have it advertised as discontinued. Really a piece of junk, should have bought the tasin 180. Thought I was getting something better for the price."
2,Another Book Dominated by Male Writers,"Out of 24 essays, only four are by women authors. When will we exit the Dark Ages?"
4,Lively and pleasan t renditions,The beauty of the artist's voice shows through despite the difficulties of Barber's modern piano stylings. Fans of Barber's vocal music will enjoy this CD.
3,for decorative use only - did not mold our shortbread,"The mold is beautiful and makes a great display piece, but we never figured out how to actually mold our shortbread using the mold. It didn't come with instructions. We initially baked the shortbread in it, but that was next to impossible to remove. I then followed various instructions from the web for other molds, but it just never produced shortbread with any detectable design."
4,"Gread Signal , Bad Case Design (Better than MyFi)","Great Signal (better than a MyFi XM2Go ) because the XM antenna is on the top of the headphones . Even in the woods fair Signal some cutouts. But poor Case design VERY hard to get out of The dock to use in your car.Pros. Great signal (with NO repeaters)FM Radio As a backup (but unless your undergroundYou'll have good signal)Cons. VERY BAD CASE DESIGN feels cheep , very hard to removeRoady 2 from The Personal Audio System."
4,Great addition to your Roady 2,"I have a Roady 2 which was in the car, but now is mostly at home on a home conversion kit. But I hate cranking up the XM radio to hear it upstairs or when I am running all around the house.This is a special headphone set with a built in XM antenna. As long as you are in range of the southern sky, where the XM satellite lives, you can pick up wonderful XM broadcasts.The unit consists of a cassette that holds the Roady 2. It charges up a battery and you attach the special headphones that bring in the signal. The battery lasts in my use about 4-8 hours of continuous play.The unit is a tad heavy compared to a cd player or tape player portable and a LOT heavier than a MP3 but you get your XM radio nearly anywhere.Will not work in a shielded building or too far away from a window where you can get the satellite feed."
4,A good item,"I have found that this item works great in and outdoors. It is great for jogging or just walking around the house, however It does not get good reception in buses."
2,"It works as promised, but not worth the money","Being a huge fan of XM, I was excited when I saw this product. Sure it looked bulky, but I wasn't going to be moving around much while I used it, and I was going to use it only outside. The first unit I received worked fine, but the volume/FM frequency selector ""toggle"" snapped off within the first few hours, leaving me unable to adjust either. This appeared to be a design flaw, and as such I promptly returned it without incident. I did get a second one and am mindful of this toggle switch. I do note that even with careful use, the headphones age very quickly, and I do not think they will last too long. The bottom line is that the product works as advertised, but does so at great expense, bulk, and does not appear to be durable. If you can get a much lower price, go for it!"
3,I'm glad I found it for $50...,"..because I wouldn't dream of paying $150. The case is a bit bulky, but it's a good cost effective personal XM Radio alternative."
1,"Great idea, poor product.........","I was offered this product for $130 off the regular price of $149. I thought what the hey, for $19.99 and free S&H I'd try it. The reception is poor outdoors unless you are in an open field with no trees or objects nearby. And the sound output level is also terrible. I bought it mostly to use while working in the yard, mowing and etc., but you can't hear the xm or fm output. I have also tried walking into the house with it on, and it just fades to no signal. I am very disappointed in this product. Again, I would not recommend this product to my worse enemy."
5,Neat little device ...,I couldn't past this up for the price I got it for. I got it for $49.00 at Walmart (in-store-clearance). It work well in certain places ... I am able now to listen to XM on the go ... It is a little bulky but it still worth getting.
4,Great Product,"I am very happy with this product. Allows me to use my Delphi car unit at the beach, pool, anywhere outside, without an expensive unit and additional monthly fee from XM Sirius. One word of caution: the side-mount volume control is not very solid and broke within 3 days of use. I needed a replacement. Now I know to be very gentle with it."
2,Poor design,"The item works as described, the problem is the toggle switch, which has now snapped off. The customer service advises that if it isn't under warranty then they cannot repair it. Poor product support. Not worth the cost when you can't get it repaired if not under warranty."
4,Metropolis vs. Smallville,"I have to say that my experience with XM Radio is mixed. I've had very positive experiences with reception [via Terrestrial Antenna] in Milwaukee, WI; I've also had a less positive experience with intermittent reception via SAT. at home here in Round Rock (Texas). I suspect that most people don't realize that there are two types of reception with the XM radio. If your 'city' has Terrestrial reception, then you will get great reception inside your building; in underground parking structures, and places like the mall(s). If you rely on Satellite, then reception depends on a clear shot of the southern sky.I ordered the Roady2 (SA 10109) Personal Audio System For $19.00, so I don't think I had any outlandish expectations. I LOVE XM RADIO!!!"
2,Not what I thought,"I'm sure it's a perfectly good piece of equipment but I was expected the XM Roady 2 with the personal audio system so I was a little surprised when it arrived. Returned it, no problems and what I really wanted is on the way!"
5,9th Wonder isn't the only one desrving shine on this one!,"This album really catches you by surprise. I was expecting soming this that had incredible production, but lacked an emcee that could stand out over it. I was easily mistaken! Not only does Kaze hold his own over 9th Wonder's beats, I'd say he outshines 9th altogether (thought the beats are fire as well). Kaze takes you back to '94 when every almost every album was an artist's debut and a near classic.Stand out tracks: Spirit Of '94, Locked In Chains, 50/50 Amp, Soul Dojo, On, Should've Been Here, and Last Laugh.There is not a bad song on this album, and it is a must for any hip hop fan!"
5,Wonderful Train Set!!!,"This is a great train set!! My 4 children play with this set just about every day. The price is great also (especially compared to the Thomas The Tank sets). One thing I will say, make sure you keep the instructions. Without them, you will have a hard time putting the train tracks back together each time. I keep our instructions put up in a cabinet so they don't get lost."
5,He Loves It!,We bought this toy for our 2 year old grandson and it immediately became his favorite toy. He is really getting into imaginative play now which the train set encourages. He also likes to put the track together himself...it's like a puzzle for him. The only problem is that there are small pieces so we don't let him play with it without close supervision. I can't wait to add to the set!
2,false representation,This set does NOT include nearly enough pieces to construct the picturedtrain set. There are appr. nine pieces missing. Nowhere in the fine print is it stated that you need to buy additional track to construct the pictured set.
2,Train set looks good but not sturdy,"we bought this train set for our 3 year old son who is a train fanatic. Although the pieces are solid wood, the tracks would not stay together ! If you so much as breathed on it, the tracks fell apart. The end pieces, shaped like wooden puzzle pieces, could not hold any pressure such as little hands pushing the train around the track. The red plastic support beams were useless as well. We tried tape but that did not work either. If the track won't stay together - the toy is useless !"
5,I love this strip!,"This is one of my favorite comics. I love Alison Bechdel! I have all of the books, and I have been a fan for about 8 years. She's always so funny and insightful. It's like reading a soap opera. I can hardly wait for each installment. You really get to know and love all of the characters, and it's hard not to get emotional over the story lines. Everyone should read all of her books."
2,Wealth of information but poor quality book.,"The Illustrated Sourcebook of Mechanical Components has a great amount of information that is nearly invaluble for practicing engineers. It is a staple of my library and I turn to it first when I need ideas on a new design. However, the quality of the book construction itself is extremely poor. The pages are not sewn in signatures, but are instead glue-backed single sheets as you would see in a perfect bound paperback. Unlike a paperback though, the spine is hollow, so there is no support for the text block. Intended as a reference book, the construction is more suited to a mass-market romance novel, and will not stand up to the rigors of the intended usage. Even with careful use, I've had pages fall out and the text block separate in the middle. For $130, McGraw-Hill should be ashamed. I will not be buying any reference book from them without being able to see it in person first."
2,"other, cheaper releases have more mixes...","This is an interesting remix/remake of the track ""He's a Dream"" from the original soundtrack to Flashdance. The female vocals sound like they may have been rerecorded and not the original artist, but the instrumental sample sounds like it's from the original track. get a different version (like the domestic) for more mixes than this, because this is a great one to add to your collection if you love dance music AND are a fan of the original song."
1,When BIBLE needs to be an acronym?,"Talk about selling out to the whims of 21st century secularism... When the word Bible has to stand for something other than the bible, we have lost our way.Where is the focus of the client in bible counseling? I believe that those seeking help and counseling need the focus to be on their healing, not the dogmatic agenda of the counselor. How is that going to help someone? It makes them more dependent, and vulnerable, to the manipulators of the faith.Drop your personal agenda, ask your client questions and let them organize their options and plans for moving through their challenges. When stuck, find appropriate guidance on such topics biblically and ask the person to be accountable for their actions. The key to success is listening with a non-judgemental mind."
4,THIS LAUNCHER IS THE CHEAPEST BUT YOU WILL HAVE FUN,I HAVE A BLAST WITH THESE WATER BALLOON LAUNCHER YOU CAN LAUNCH A WATER BALOOON A LONG WAY THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS THE BALLOONS CAN TRAVEL AS FAST AS 75 MILES AN HOUR AND ADULT SUPERVISION EYE PROTECT ARE REQUIRED THEY CAN ALSO LAUNCH T-SHIRTS SNOW BALLS AND OTHER ITEMS YOU MUST BE CAREFULL WITH THIS ITEM
5,"Excellent Book, very well done","This book is written not just for a gay audience, as you might initially suspect. It offers touching stories that women, who happen to be lesbian, face in raising their families. The photos are beautiful and capture the emotion and love that these special families feel for one another. Well done."
5,"Great Book, Does the Story Justice","I really don't agree with any criticism of this book be it minor or major. I think that Smith did a tremendous job. He covers each era of the band in sufficient depth to understand the characters involved and the work they did. He benefits from Robert Fripp's detailed and (as always) well-thought out analysis of each phase of the band, but takes care to present the views of other members where they diverge from Fripp's. I did get a feeling from this book that all members had been heard from, and that I now posessed an understanding of each phase of this band. Really a great job of researching and writing.And, the band has made a load of great music, which makes this a great book to read."
1,"I'd love to review this book, but...","Though I bought this book from Amazon, I never received it nor the requested refund."
4,Diva by Sarah Brightman,"Sarah is my favorite. Diva is great, but most of the pieces are on other CDs and I like them better."
4,Gorgeous Voice,What a beautiful voice. We are thoroughly enjoying her album - particularly the selections from Phantom.
5,The Diva Hath Spoken,"Slipping quietly onto store shelves, ""Diva:The Singles Collection"" is a great companion piece to previous release ""Classics"". Sarah Brightman's talent has gone largely unignored by pop radio; however, her ethereal voice has gained her a huge following ( she sells out arenas...so somebody's gotta be listening!) worldwide. ""The Singles Collection"" is just that, a sort of ""Greatest Hits/Best of/Most Loved"" Brightman classics. Starting with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and straight through till ""Time To Say Goodbye"", the songs here are a well appointed batch for those new to Sarah Brightman. Of course die-hards will always cry foul--some major ""singles""--""Harem"" and ""Eden"" come to mind but are missing off the track list. But never fear, the songs here are amazing."
5,Awesome!,"I had never heard of her until I saw an advertisement on TV. Her voice is so beautiful. I bought the cd, and fell in love with her. A perfect mix of songs, now I want to buy more of her cds. I am going to wear this out listening to it! Awesome cd!"
3,A great introduction-with one little flaw...,Since this is a compilation I will keep this brief. I will also not go into detail about how some people need to stop whining (and lying about how they obtained their copy).I bought this for the artwork and to have one cd with a new mix up of her songs to throw in the car. Many diehard fans wanted a bonus track included to make this cd special but the US didnt get one on its version so no use crying over spilt milk right.I do like to give this one to people to introduce Sarahs great talent.I did find it odd that a big single like Harem wasnt included-but something like What You Never Know was-and that song is just not that great IMO.Thats about it.
3,"Same old, same old","Though the beautiful voice of Sarah Brightman is still a wonder, the songs are repetitive of all her earlier works. I suggest getting Time To Say Goodbye and her Classics albums. Save your money on this latest one.Loretta Collins"
5,Sarah Brightman La Diva,"This is an amazing CD for new fans and for your collection if you are a fan yet, the songs are carefully selected for being a great CD!! A question of honour is different from the Fly CD, if you are a Sarah's fan this CD is perfect, if you don't you will be a Sarah's fan!!"
2,Sarah Brightman's second best songs,"Sarah Brightman does an amazing job on any material, but this selection of songs is not up to her wonderful talent."
5,No one like Brightman,"The only way to describe this vocal is BEAUTIFUL... this cd is worth ever penny and then some. This cd just proves Sarah Brightman is the best Operatic pop singer out there! (Listen to the song ""Deliver Me""... enough said!)I have only recently become a fan, but I will be one forever.You should also consider ""Symphony"" this too is a FANTANSTIC cd... one of the songs I truly love is a duet ""I will be with you"" with ""Paul Stanley"" yes that Paul Stanley of the group ""KISS"". And lastly ""A Winter Symphony"" this has a little bit of Christmas and a lot of beautiful music."
2,Nothing New,"I give 'Diva' a low score not because Sarah is not great but because there is nothing new here. If you have a Brightman collection, as I have, you will have heard most all that this CD has to offer. I wish I'd known that before I bought."
1,Ripoff,"Don't buy this album. The great majority of the pieces appear on previous recordings and collections. Sarah must be at the end of her career, if this is the best she can present to her audience."
2,"""Too Much Form, Not Enough Substance""","I recently heard Sarah Brightman referred to as ""the greatest sopranoalive today"". Whoever thinks that does not know many sopranos. TakeSarah away from recording studio equipment and sound engineers, and hervoice fades and flutters. If you want to hear a great living soprano,try Joan Sutherland. Or, Kiri Te Kanawa. Or, Dawn Upshaw. Or, KristaSantilli. Or, Julieta Aleman. My list could be longer, but I believeI've made my point. Call Sarah Brightman what she really is:a commercially successful, but artistically mediocre chanteuse.I rate this album a five on a scale of ten. Ray Harp, April 5, 2009"
4,Almost!,"I have always been a sucker for Sarah and so glad they stuck with the original duets like Jose Cura's (my favorite tenor oozing with great machismo) and Andrea Bocelli. My only complaint is the Phantom of the Opera with Steve Harley (who is he?) Pardon me, I don't want to be mean but this is soooo horrific, let alone it was on track no. 1. What a terrible thing to start the cd. When I play cd, I skip no. 1 and the rest is simply divinely Sarah. I would have seen soooo tickled if she dueted Phantom with Gerard Butler (another macho cutie pie)."
2,No No No,"When I saw the tracklisting on this CD, I was hoping for REMIXES!!! These tracks could have been better. Harem (remix) Free (remix) and many more SHOULD HAVE been on this"
4,good guide,Great guide to help you through the game step by step. with this guide you will not miss anything in the game.
5,A multicultural coming of age story,"Imagine going to a country in which you do not speak the language. Your parents have sent you to live with your aunt and uncle to prevent the ""bad"" influences from your own country from affecting you. When you reach this new country you quickly find the only relief you have from an overbearing aunt is the bicyle messanger gangs that roam through the city and learning the slang language that they speak. Throw in a case of mistaken love, a death of a close friend, learning a new language, and most importantly who you are and you have discovered the beautiful story the The Island of the Bicycle Dancers by Jiro Adachi. I highly recommend this to adults and older teen readers."
3,"Short, interesting, but unsatisfying novel.","""Island of Bicycle Dancers"" is the coming-of-age story of Yuriko, who was sent to America by her parents in Japan because of all the trouble she was in over there. She lives with her Korean relatives, and she has an antagonistic relationship with her aunt. She secretly begins to learn English, with the help of her cousin, and later a bicycle messenger named Whitey and her uncle's Thai paramour. Yuriko falls hard for the badboy messenger Hector (aka Bone), and this set off a chain of events that ultimately leads to tragedy as someone close is killed as result of Bone's actions. The novel does bring Manhattan to life, and does explore the uneasy relations between Koreans and Japanese, but the relationships don't make sense, and there's a ghost talking to Yuriko after a tragic death."
3,Good enough,The sound quality was good but the music was not the original by Michael W Smith. The back ground vocal is too loud and drowns the your own voice.
3,Informative,This book gives simple spells for protection or money making in just how you arrange furniture. I recomend this book to some one with a new house or to a person who wants to re-arrange their rooms for better luck.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Sorry if you liked this book, but there are soooo many others out there that are so much better and much more detailed. Try reading Shakti Gawain, Karen Rausch Carter, Carolyn Myss and Deepak Chopra. This author goes into astrology (and a lot of it is very wrong), and almost makes up her own chakra colors. She's more wrong than right. I strongly suggest you do your own research and try other authors. You don't have to ""cast"" you can simply affirm."
2,I was dissapointed,"For some reason, this bottle doesn't smell as good as the one that my friend has. The bottles are identical, but this one has such a strong smell to it. It's not as soft as It supposed to be. I was very dissapointed."
3,Ideal winter fragrance,"Brit has quite a sugary vanilla sweet that is suited to the colder months. It reminds me of a roaring fireplace and warm trench coats (perhaps because of the plaid bottle...signature burberry).It has been described as having notes of lime, icy pear, green almond, white peony, sugared almond, mahogany wood, amber, vanilla beans and tonka beans, however after the 1st 20min all I am left with is the vanilla :-)If you like sweet, comfortable fragrances that are not overpowering this is a safe bet."
5,Good replacement struts,"Good firm ride, about the same ride as stock ones before they started leaking. High quality finish. Fit is good with hole alignment and springs."
3,The internal bendable frame is uncomfortable,"First, I would like to say that I received the contour pillow in a timely manner and in good condition. However, I can feel the inner frame to the extent that I keep having to adjust the pillow to escape its discomfort. I did not return the pillow and hope to somehow make use of it. But, beware, you may have issues with it."
3,Left it at destination,"It didnt keep its position very well, and the twist material is not as long as the pillow.In general not a quality product. I left it in Norway and filled my bag with something else."
3,Cuddly pillow,"It is truly one of those products you have to ""try on for size"". A few of my friends love it, while others can't get it to fit their neck and head. I would order it, but save the receipt in case you want to return it."
2,"OK, nothing special","Pretty unbelievable -- some totally impossible scenes. Nothing special. Unless you are extremely bored, I wouldn't waste my time."
3,filter set,"average product as to the quality of the filters, case in which they are held is too tight and eventually will mare the filters. Price was reasonable not great, shipping took longer than promised."
4,Great Kitchen option,"There was one of these units left in the house we just purchased last winter, and when all of a sudden it stopped working I really wanted to replace it with the same item.The speakers in this unit are great, when there are clear radio stations it is really nice. The antenna (which is part of the electrical cord) is not as good on this unit as the last one, but for the most part I can get the stations I really want. The CD player works just fine, and I can crank the volume to the point that I can hear it just fine in 3 other rooms in the house (and my house is very spread out).Definitely glad I was able to replace my old unit."
2,"Academic, Not Practical","This book is good for academics that need a history of focus groups and a summary of research studies that investigate the technique itself. This is an interesting history, with many studies weighing in on what makes focus groups better or worse. But, as a practitioner, there is little that I found particularly new or insightful in the book. I think that Stewart's work is a better guide for someone that needs details on how to conduct a focus group. So, while good for PhD students, this book I found less good for managers."
5,whoa..,"I have never seen such a marvelous book. This story continues the hit series about Hideki and his persocom Chi. Though it has SOME nudity it is still unsurpassed. If this was a novel it'll be a classic. If Chobits is a porno, the Titanic would be a 5-star adult film."
4,"Great, but not excellent","Chobits is probably one of Clamp's best series, but some of the writing is a bit weak. Clamp has done a wonderful job of making the reader feel for the characters, and the art is simple, but it shines. Unfortunately, having just about everybody in Hideki's life play some part in what's going on with Chii, kind of annoyed me a bit. It's still a wonderful series and I'd recommend this to anyone.Also, if there's any Angelic Layer fans out there, there's something in here that you may enjoy."
4,"Wonderful, deeply moving, poignant book.","This book interested me because of the subject matter: writing, infertility, and the choices many women writers have made about having (or not having) a family and possibly sacrificing their writing time and space. Alden does a beautiful job. She is amazingly truthful. The book brought me to tears at least once. And, thankfully, she does not find an easy, wrap-it-up solution for such a loaded issue. The book is as much about writing as it is about having children. It's also interesting that a small press was the first one to publish it. Impressive book."
4,This is a wonderful book on many levels.,I read this book shortly after confronting my own infertility. What a wonderful storyteller! I found myself in tears on one page and laughing on the next. I highly recommend it to anyone on their own journey through infertility or anyone who likes a well-told tale.
2,"Cheap and ugly, but functional","This item is for bachelor pads only. It's ugly and cheap. It is of poor quality: it feels flimsy, the foam in the base had to be pushed back in, the threading doesn't feel solid, and the base is not heavy enough. Don't be fooled by the pictures. Even if you got this for free, you would be tempted to throw it away. Not a keeper."
1,Worst quality,"After remodelling our kitchen, I wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out. When I saw the picture of the towel holder, I thought it unique with its scroll-work and wouldn't look like everything else I saw. When I received it, the first thing I noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible. I tried with no luck to remove the stains. The area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt! All in all, I would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship."
4,Good,I like the way the book was organized in offering different variations in how to play different card games as well as the different scoring.
1,NO GOOD!,"Of course Aretha could never really record a bad album but this one smacks a little of record company ""let's take them for all they've got"" motives. The sound quality is that of a demo-tape from the fifties and there is absolutely nothing gained from buying this album rather than any other more modern one. Aretha started great and remained consistent so anything she recorded later is better than this. I recommend any of the compilations from the seventies."
5,Very Durable!,"I have two extremely active boys that play with these train sets. We have some of the name brand sets and a LOT of the Imaginarium sets, the only peices we have had to break (splinter) are the name brand peices. They are well worth the money!The only problem I have is the tressel bridge, which doesn't seem to stand up to very active play--mind you though that my boys are extremely active! The bridge just keeps falling down during play."
4,Not enough curved pieces,The tracks are great although with just this set one can not make a complete track - you have to buy more sets to do that.
4,Best Game,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is much more challenging than the first one. also it is much more fun than the first one. You get to jack vehicles, you get four guns each helps you in different place in the game, you also get a really cool hoverboard which you can do tricks on, the music is also very good it dosent get annoying like most games do, the graphics are awesome. Overall this is a really good game. I cant wait untill the 3rd one comes out."
4,98% done and the ending is a joke!,"Why is it a joke? Cuz it did an auto save in the room with the final boss battle and left me without the ability to stock up ammo for all of my great weapons. Being handicapped this way makes the game artificially harder, not better. Why should I not be able to use 3 of my 4 weapons after I sent 25 hours of game play building my weapons up in preperation for the toughest boss battle yet? Every other level let me stock up on ammo, why should this be different? This is a cruel joke and the game designers should be embarassed to have this flaw in their game. Other than the ending, the graphics, story, characters and vehicles are all great to excellent. This game was an absolute blast for 98% of the way thru, so consider yourself warned!"
5,"Great Game, It is Supposed to be Hard","This game is great. It is a lot different then Precursor Legacy, but it is supposed to be. It is supposed to be for an older audiences, so a few little curses don't matter. What are you guys 10!It may be harder, but that's a good thing. Most platformers are just mindlessly wondering around finding little things. This one doesn't do that. I spent about 15 hours to beat the game and that was 15 hours of solid gameplay. More games should be like this. Most platformers are way too short.Its a good game. It does a real good job of re-creating a GTA atmosphere.Anyway, you other whiny reviwers are just wosses. If you give a great game like this 3 stars just because they say a couple curse words and it is too hard. You all can just go cry to your mommies. For all of you other real gamers who want a good game that is challenging and will take you a while to beat,check out Jak 2"
3,"Great game, horrible handling.","I'm a big fan of the Jak series (especially 2 and 3); however, the condition this particular copy was shipped in wasn't up to my expectations. There are quite a few scratches, most are minor and can be fixed easily. Unfortunately, some don't look so easy to fix. I suspect the poor packaging (it came in one of those CD sleeves) is the culprit. I'd recommend looking for another seller who ships with a little more quality in mind. It'd be worth a couple extra bucks.All well. If you're willing to gamble on whether your copy can be fixed (assuming it wasn't just my copy), it's a great game and worth the buy."
1,What is this crap? Grand Theft Auto??,"I got this for my cousin who was obbessed with the 1st 1. He loved the 1st one!But the 2nd one was horrible and DARK!Now all he does is go around and sqeal everytime he sees my boyfriend, Jack.He thinks he's Jak from Jak II because he has a goatee and his name is Jack. By the way this gets worse, my name is Ashlin. Poor ,little fellow. I will never ever buy this game again! You should put a warning label saying kids will run around in fear after playing this game.This is the scary part our family has a pet ferret! creepy huh?"
1,Too Hard.,This game is only for hardcore game addicts who love the ultimate in arcade style difficulty. I bought is to play with my 2 kids. We stopped and threw the game in the trash after trying and failing the tank chase challenge for 2 hours in a row.Don't waste your money on this junk.
2,Dreadful,"Yuck. Another ""practice your skills"" game. Each time you fail you're punished by being sent back to the beginning of the level. I received this game as crapware packed with a PS2 bundle, and it thoroughly deserves it."
2,A great game......Gone real BAD!!!,The beginning of this game is great. By the middle it gets real boring and very repetitive. The missions for Krew are fun...but there is one mission where you have to collect money for him. That one is harder than any mission in the game.There is one more thing about the game. All the rage over this Jet-Board is really getting to me. I thought that once you beat the first arena challenge that you get the board. WRONG..you have to wait till you are near the end to get it.So...in short you could spend your money on other and better games.
1,What's with that???????????,Target can't ship this game to Hawaii????? What's with that?I'll buy it from another company that understands that I am an American and Hawaii as well as Alaska is part of America. What's wrong with Target?? Are they isolationist?
4,It is hard but it worth it,"Jak II as everybody says it is very different from the prequel, that much that I don't remember Jak as it was, now, it talks, but he is p**s off. Daxter doesn't say anything when Jak drops down, I miss that. Guns, not as good as Ratchet and Clank but they work, actually in this game is better that you have skills in driving, very good skills.It gets frustrating, if you are used to giving up, don't buy this, it's a challenge, I don't get how people can finish this in 16 hours.The big city doesn't provide anything to the game, only obstacles in mini-games.It moves very well, the graphics are pretty damn good, the sound so so.But is difficult, difficult, very difficult sometimes, it is that hard that when something is not that hard, you say, Is that it?I would put 5 stars if they put an Easy, Normal, Hard setting and if they shrink the size of the Hub city, waste of time there.See you!"
5,MOSTLY Fantastic,"This game is almost identical to the game Ratchet and clank. And thats a good thing. You have a isdekick, daxter, and guns. You run around a huge world and do missions. EXACTLY like RC. BUt i loved RC so im not complaining :) Theres only one thing annoying about it. Whenever your in a mission and you die, you have to start over from the begginging!! YES the beginning. So i have said many curses at this game for that reason. Otherwise this game is fantastic (way better than the first) If you want something exactly like RC or just ooking for a great new platformer, this is it! We here at X-play give it a 5, out of 5."
2,Frustrating? Yes. Compelling? Maybe. Precursor Legacy? No.,"OK, I admit, I'm not a hard-core gamer. In fact, I appreciate a game that is easy to learn and yet challenging enough to keep my interest. I can't help but think that Jak II is Naughty Dog's response to criticism that JAD might have been too easy. The problem is, that was what made JAD so appealing to a lot of fair-weather gamers like myself. I'm torn between being really frustrated with the difficulty of JAK II and obsessed with wanting to make it ""just a bit farther."" I agree with other reviewers that the city hub is a poor design. If ND had designed a city that was worth exploring, or at least allowed the character to collect useful items, I would feel differently. As it is, I feel like I'm stuck in rush hour traffic between missions. I do think that the jet board missions are cool, but other than that, there's not much that makes me want to keep coming back to Jak II."
2,This game blows,"I like to play games to enjoy myself, not be maddingly frutrated and criss cross back and forth accross the same sorry city. Read the very first review on this game. This reviewer nailed it. Can't wait to fire Rachet & Clank: Going Commando."
4,JAK and DAXTER II,"This game just blew my mind away! As soon AS I started playing it I Realized all the different characters and the more adult themed storyline. I loved it, For the first time JAK Talks. Although one thing dissapoints me, its rated T so not all Kids can experince the pleasures of this game. I really liked the new gun play, and the fact that you can drive. Naughty dog really needed another good game for ps2 besides The first Jak And Daxter game, seein in all the 4th crash bandiccot for PS2.....!"
4,For Hardcore Gamers only!,"Get this. Most people out there don't like this game either because its too hard or its too GTAish. Youngins should stay out of this game. And people who are very bad at games should stay away from this game also. I wouldn't call this the best game ever because its not. People who say this game has bad graaphics are wrong. Thye've only saw screenshots of this game and already jump to conclusions. I, myself am a hardcore gamer, and find this game somewhat amusing, challenging, and fun. It all matter in taste if you really want this game. If you hate GTA and swear words than by all means stay away from this game. If you are a hardcore gamer than, join the club."
5,SO COOL!!,"I'm about to beat this game already, its the best game I ever played. Me and my friends LOVE this game so much.IT THE BEST GAME.It's worth erery cent.It has anuf actin and a small hint of funnynes.did i menchen I like ham."
5,Ready to kick some krimsen gaurd but?,"This game is one of the only games in the world that my whole family enjoys. It is beutifully animated; andwhats this? Jak talks!!! I was hooked as soon as i got my first gun and drove my first hovercraft. I recomend this game to anyone who craves to get back at the producers and makers of the infeririar ""Jak and Daxter"" with the only attacks of a whimpy punch or kick.I also reccomend it for people who enjoyed ""Grand Theft Auto:Vice City"". You ca hijack police vehicles and everything"
2,"Too gloomy, too random; I don't like it","The area isn't exactly the fantacy world Jak and Daxter 1 was set in, that is one of my all time favorite games, everywhere he went it looked plesant, but this game is mostl building reuins, geto, and swamp. You have to check back in to the same location after each mission, and it's hard to find since everything looks the same, and when think you are about to find it you run into the sombody and a large attack begains; by the time you escape you have totaly lost your way again. Jak does have a cool hover board he can flip out at any time, and a laser rifel he can use to shoot the bad guys. I do like the hover vechiles that Jak can ""jak"" anytime they fly over head"
5,Excellent Game,If you like Jak II style of game (open environment) then you should definitely check out Beyond Good and Evil by UBI Soft from the creator of Rayman. Both are very original and rare gems in the game industry!!!
4,Awesome,"There back and better than ever. in this new and improved sequel you get guns, zoomers at your disposal, guns, dark powers, more guns, titan suit, and more guns!!! Also it got game of the year in PSM and a bunch of other awesome ratings! Any one who likes plastation will love the new adventure of Jak and Daxter.P.S. you can get codes and play as Daxter in this one!!"
1,Awesome...... BUT HARD!!!,"When it first came out, I thought it would be cool. It is,...But its soooo hard. rent it before you buy it.By mr.carolynAname Extrordinaire"
3,Jak Jak Jak....Uh...What's next,"Jak's okay, but don't get your hopes up that this is going to be a great game. The engine is pretty good, the graphics aren't great and let me say a one word phrase, ""rental."" This game just does not have the replayability factor, although you also wont solve it in one day like some platform games such as VooDoo Vince. The game is okay, just not great!"
3,"It's beautiful and funny but nix that ""timed race"" junk","All in all a pretty enjoyable game - certainly one of the best ""production value"" games I've seen so far... the only thing that really wore me down was the regular appearance of the dreaded ""timed race"" level. I just don't get a lot of enjoyment out of racing through an obstacle course 20 times in order to complete it with just the right degree of precision. That's a poor excuse for level/mission design and it caused me to put the game away in frustration/boredom several times before completing an otherwise deserving effort. Give me clever puzzles... give me challenging scenarios... but don't try to pad your gameplay by making me drive around a big city over and over wasting time and playing taxi driver."
4,T's review,This game is so sweet I want to have the first copy of the next Jak game to hit the stores.
4,it pulls you in,"this is one of the best games i have ever played. there is so much to do. you dont have to stick to the story line either, it's just like grand theft auto 3. you can go from person to person taking jobs from who you like, or you can just cruise around jacking cars and roughing up the citizens of haven city. the levels aren't hard either. they are incredible from finding artifacts to rescue missions to all out wars with the metal heads. like i said if you dont like one level you can just go to another person and get a different level. my favorite part has to be fighting side to side with other characters. what else can i say. this is truly an awesome game."
2,"All the young kids miss out, not appropriate for under 13","My family (all 4 of us) enjoyed Jak and Daxter. We looked forward to Jak II for quite some time and then bought it even though it was rated T. I am disappointed that Naughty Dog has taken a great kids game and decided to make it darker for the Teen crowd. I sure don't want my 9 year old using the words that seem to be commonplace in this game. Also, aren't there enough games out there that use guns and the object is to shoot people. There are too few games like Jak and Daxter and Spyro. It's too bad this sequel is not appropriate for the younger gamers who don't have a lot of good adventure type games to choose from."
3,"Get Jack and Daxter, the original","Let's go back in time, shall we?Well, a couple of years ago, Ps2 just came out and Jack and Daxter first was avalible. I bought them both and loved them both. Jack and Daxter is easier, better, funner, appropite and a lot of other stuff. When this came out, I got really Really excited. So I bought it, and I kind of liked it for a few minutes but then it turned out to suck. It's too darn hard!!! It should be rated M or something how hard this game is. Enough with the Baron and all theses freakin' bonusus, ok?!I can't beat any of the levels, I don't know where the heck I am supposed to go. I am an UNHAPPY customer. Now they came out with a Jack 3...Well...I heard it was the last one they were gonna make ao maybe I'll buy it. I wouldn't feel right playing it though and not finishing the second one..."
4,This is off the hook!,"This is SOOOO much fun.Better adventures, better characters, better missions, wait...and they even notched up the rating from E to T for teen. A worthy game!"
3,Got stuck and not able to finish the game,"This game is pretty fun, but mostly frustrating. Let me say, I love Jak! However, this game is difficult. And it just seems to get harder as it goes along. Some of the challenges my son and I have tried at least 50 times to pass and we still cannot get through them. We are now stuck at this one part where you have to shoot down all the guys flying at you. Neither one of us has been able to pass this mission and we cannot finish the game. Very disappointing."
4,Not as good as the first,"My family was looking forward to this sequel to Jak and Daxter. THe first game was colorful, fun, and a nice change of pace from all of the games where you run around and shoot people. Unfortunately, the sequel is simply a game where you run around and shoot people. The biggest dissappointment is the lack of color- almost the whole game is set in a dark and futuristic world. Parents- they have also added some mild profanity, probably to make the game seem ""cool"" and ""edgy"". All it does is take away the charm of the first one. The things we enjoyed about the first one- colelcting power cells, scout flies, etc. are all gone. Now you hijack cars and shoot people with your gun. All of this is also more difficult, and you usually cannot move on to anything else until completing your mission. The first game gave you plenty to do, and then come back to tough spots later. All in all, Jak 2 is a frustrating game."
4,Beats Grand Theft Auto,"this game is exactly like grand theft except for the fact you get four sweet ass guns and a hover board and flying/hovering vehicals to steal also you can turn into a powerful jak and also there is some secrets you can get when you beat the game. like big head,big goatee, and some other stuff. i personly would play this game over any grand theft auto game."
1,Jak 2 is horrible,"Jak 2 has got to be the worst game I have ever played, it has horrible gameplay, storyline, graphics and it just is crappy! I hope you dont waster your money on it! (...)"
1,not what we expected,"My 10-year-old loved Jak & Daxter. This sequel has been a big disappointment. It's rated T instead of E and he's uncomfortable with the dark, more sinister story line, which includes imprisonment and torture. Read up on this before buying for younger gamers."
2,Please....Overrated!!!!,This game doesn't match the bite with the bark. The graphics in this game are certainly not up to par. The gameplay is good and the controls are fine. The game is not all that fun to play. Time for them to move on. Typical platforming.
1,what a horrible game.,jak ii is an awful game the characthers are worthless theres too much veichle traveling. too vieolont too hard controllers suck no story awful poorly executed game. then again i hated the first one too.
2,it sucks,jak 2 is the worst game ive EVER played. if you wanna have fun get a spyro game because this game is a load of horse crap. you can never get anywhere on it it incluses bad graphics cheap deaths and insane difficulty level. but ill break it down into the cons and pros of the game. pros funny cut scenes. cons bad graphics bad music bad characthers annoying insane difficulty level worlds too big horrible missions not so fun to play more of a chore than a treat.
3,Frustration is a keyword,"Yes, Jak 2 is a long game. The towns you must operate the hovercraft in are a confusing maze. It seems to take forever just to complete one task let alone beat the clock in some missions. In defense of the game, It is quite innovative and I see nothing objectionable about Jak's new, tougher look. To sum it all up. The game is just plain hard and demands patience. Be prepared for a challenge if you buy this game."
5,Go naughty dog,This game is awsome its the best game ive played it has great graphics and a little hard. If you like action adventure games this one is #1!so forget crappy bionicle games and get this one.
4,The outstanding sequel comes to your home.,"This sequel to jak and daxter the precursor legacy holds itself pretty well.With a massive city and exits to outside areas, it makes for a long but very intresting storyline.Immediately after the events of jak and daxter jak, daxter, and their friends are taken far into the future. Now they are in Haven City, the large metropolis that was built over sandover village.Their arrival does not go smoothly however. Jak is imprisoned and spends two years being tortured and experimented with the dreaded dark eco.Daxter meets up with jak and the two set to exact revenge on the people who tortured jak.Very good game, it has a fantastic storyline, huge environment, and it ties it all together with the gta-inspired freedom to go where you want to go when you want to."
1,Not Cool,Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.
3,JAK2,it is a great game if you get bord save at the point your at and reak habick.The only way to reak habik is to get the poleas atenttion.Steall a poleas crafts or hit a poleas man.Then there is a poleas chase start off with a fast craft then swich crafts rapidly.The poleas after a wile will stop chasing you if not cause a big crash then jomp off your craft and run out the poleas will stop after that.
1,Can you say casual game?,"Is it me or was the playstation built for all these casual gamers to spend their money on another awful game? This game is worse than the original. You spend all your time walking around and collecting. That is all it is. And how stupid can Jak be? He tries to be cool but he sounds and looks like a moron. But if your a casual gamer, you will probably love this game becasue you need zero skill. If your a hardcore gamer like myself, don't buy this game and dump your playstation. Buy a gamecube and then you will see what a GOOD GAME is like because Nintendo is so much more hardcore than Sony and its casual gamers."
4,Pretty Good,"Parent Warning: Your kids liked Jak and Daxter? Be careful, this game is way, way more violent than the first(Jak gets guns). Overall a good game, if nothing like the first."
1,Don't waste your money,"Nothing like the first one, once you are in a level you have to stay there until you defeat it (which may take a while. You spend most of your time in the air driving your flying car finding someone to talk to. Too much air traffic. Some levels are really hard while others are way too easy. I am about 60 percent through and can't wait to finish it so I can dump it!"
2,One of the wierdest PS2 Games I have ever Played!,"I think this game sucks because I like the way the characters, and the graphics, and landscape design. But the only part of the game I don't like is the storyline because basically in the beginningyou meet this old man and you play many missions in the game and you fight some guy name the baron on some levels and at the end you actually fight the old man who was currently the leader of the metal head army in the game. So I think this game sucks because of the storyline, So If you are looking for a better game to play on the PS2 for the Holiday season! I suggest you not to (by all means) buy this game! I give this game a 2 out of 5!"
2,What happened to Jak?,"I bought this game for my daughter's 7th birthday, because we had both enjoyed playing Jak & Daxter together. I was in for a rather unpleasant surprise.The first game was very funny and cool, very different. Daxter was a little wise guy, and Jak the silent type. There was no offensive language, no excessive violence. Jak II was much different.It is rated T for Teen, but it really IMO deserves an M rating because of the offensive language and violence. (In the first few minutes of the introduction, we hear the words ""Remind me not to get you p**sed off!"" from cute little Daxter!)My daughter and I did not play it for long, because it was too difficult; and also, the scenery was too dark and depressing.I suppose Naughty Dog was trying to appeal to an older audience, but what they did was ruin a good idea. I probably won't be getting any more of the Jak products after this."
1,Boring & Over-hyped,"Many reviews hype up how this game evolved from the original Jak and Daxter. I really, really loved J&D. However, I was very much let down by this sequel.Cons:Way too many races and challenges,Very few puzzles and exploration,Endless and boring main city with everything on opposite ends of the world,Pros:Good graphics,Some fun aspectsIt seems they tried to take parts of other games (Grand Theft Auto and Ratchet and Clank) and fuse it with the fantasy-inspired original. The result is a clunky, boring game that seriously disappoints. Get Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Commando instead (or Sly Cooper, if you don't have that already.)"
1,Grand Theft Auto With Fur,"If I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto III I would. I was looking forward to a fun platformer like Jack and Daxter. This is a good game, but not really a platformer. I hope the developers of Ratchet and Clank Comando stay true to what made the original so great and do not try to do another GTA."
4,Great game,This is one of the best titles for the PS2 in my opinion. It has a lot more variety in the gameplay than the original game and a good storyline. The only disadvantage in my opinion is the great difference between this game and the original. Although the storyline does a good job at explaining the continuation the change of environment and gameplay is very different from the previous game. But other than that is a game worth playing.
4,Pretty good game.,"It's a fun game to play. Has some good challenges in it. I haven't beaten it yet. I originally got it for my sons who are 8 and 10, but it has a few cuss words in it. Not horrible, but enough to make my sons snicker at it. I let my oldest son play, but it's a little violent for my youngest. So, I think it's a perfect shoot 'em up game for older children, no blood which is a plus."
3,Full of glitches but somewhat fun,"This game has a lot of glitches, I do not know why anyone hasn't mentioned it yet. It's still fun but it can be a bit frustrating when you're playing a level and you hit jump and all Jak does is squat and fall off a cliff.Save your money and rent it."
5,This game was horrifically...,"under-rated. The difficulty is an excellent change from the first one--there is so much to do, such a longer adventure, so much diversity.One problem : not enough to do in the city. Compared to Grand Theft Auto, you can't enter any buildings, jump on roof-tops, go on complex-chases, etc.Otherwise, this is probably the best action-platformer of the year."
2,Not so much,"Okay so this is my daughter reviewing, not me:I am a teen girl and I love video games! This video game is one of my least favorites, mainly because of the controls and music. I hate to dissapoint some of you extreme Jak fans, but this game is not cool.Pros:-can be hilarious if you make a mistake-Jak is sorta hot-Daxter is so greatCons:-music is only ok-gameplay gets boring after 3 hours-some missions too stupid, such as tank scence, where i outsmarted the tank and cant get to the explosive room-dark Jak usually starts when you dont want iti know some people love this game, but this is my honest opinion."
5,A Great Sequel,I got this game for my nephew to play and every once in awhile I caught myself playing it too. It is a very exciting and addictive game. At first I couldn't understand why they would put in so many races or time trials. But when you get deeper in the game you realize that the races and the time trials help build your skills. The time trials also gets you familiar with the terrain and makes you think alot more. This game is great if you want to spend some time thinking through the missions.The characters are great and the story line is impressive. A great sequel.
4,This Game Rules !!!,"When I first played this game I thought to myself "" THIS GAME RULES !!! "" Not only can you choose to do missions any time you want, but you can obtain weapon upgrades and even your own hoverboard.Plus this game is more fun than hard. Sure your getting chased by metal heads all the time, but over all it's a good game."
3,ok for adreneline junkies...,"If you like shooting, more shooting, even more shooting, stealing vehicles, mindless repetitive racing, oh and did I mention more shooting? This is the game for you. This game is very good from a technical standpoint (good camera, controls, etc, as was the case in JAD), but it is quite different from JAD, which I liked very much (much more than Jak II). Don't know why there has been a recent trend to turn excellent platformers into GTA-style shoot-and-kill games. If I wanted that, I would have bought GTA in the first place! ;-) I hope Jak III returns to the JAD platform style, which I think is much more appealing."
1,"UNPLAYABLE, FRUSTRATING CHEAPFEST","When you start playing this game, you may have the urge to proclaim it one of the greatest games of all time. Not so fast. It would've been, if it wasn't so unplayable. It is the CHEAPEST game of all time. At 50% into the game, I got to a mission I just can't beat, no matter what I do. It just can't be done, unless you have time and patience to retry the same stupid sh** over and over again, for hours, where the slightest misstep will have you back to where you started. This is fun? Another annoying mission has you collecting 17 items. Why 17? Why not 24? How about 24 3/4? 7777? 7 million? They wanted to show how hardcore their game is? Then why they have characters with stupid donkey ears, if this is such a hardcore game? I'd like to ask the morons who made and play-tested this sh**, what were they thinking. I'm tired of garbage that floods the stores. If you want $50 for a game, why not make sure it's playable?"
2,Just not fun,"Well...as a big fan of J&D, I figured I'd love JakII. After all, I also enjoy GTAIII. The gameplay of JakII is fine, although more than a bit frustrating at times, especially when you are almost at the end of a section and die, and it sends you all the way back to the beginning. The hover cars are too difficult to manuver, and the controls are confusing to say the least.My biggest problem with Jak II is, to put it simply, the game isn't fun. Between the frustration, and the dark aura, it's simply not worth the price. If I want gritty realism, I'll drive up to Chicago. I miss the tropical atmosphere. Also, this new, edgier Jak just doesn't fit with Daxter. I keep wondering when Jak is going to pound the furball into the ground for his smart mouth. At least, in J&D, you knew why Jak put up with him, and the duo was a good match.I'll pass on buying this one. I'd rather get a game where I can have fun."
1,If I wanted to buy GTA3 I would've...,I have to say that this game misrepresents itself. It's only relation to the original game is 4 characters and a couple of pieces of geometry. It seems that the folks at Naughty Dog decided to make a Grand Theft Auto 3 game and decided to do away with the charm of the original Jak. It reaches a point of near unplayability around 55% of the way through - I like when a game takes a good deal of time to play but I don't want my playing time extended by attempting to do the same mission over and over again. (and of course forced breaks so I don't pound my console into an electrified pile of molten plastic.) The game looks good - it has an incredibly large world which can be annoying when all you want to do is go to the next mission - it has interesting weapons - BUT it really has nothing to do with the original.It should have been called Jak and Daxter present Grand Theft Auto in Angrytown.
5,The Best...,"I have all four in the Jak series except Jak X, and Jak 2 is very good. For one thing, you can steal ships, and which makes this good, you can't steal ships in the first or third game. And probably the best of all, it introduces guns to the gameplay, which probably gets more teenagers to play. Jak matured from the the first Jak and Daxter, so there is some language and things like that. Overall, it's good.Stealing ships. Ah, that's the best part. You could steal any ship you want, and even the guard ships (which are the best) but they all atack you for that. I just beat up more, and they keep coming. Ha.I haven't finished any of them yet, but I've heard that there's hoverboards in this game. For all you that played, is that right? But that just sounds cool riding hoverboards. So thanks for reading this. I appreciate it."
3,Crunch Time,""" Do we all care so much because we think it's morally wrong, or do we just feel screwed by someone who played the game better?""SATs are an extremely stressful time. So what's the smart thing to do? Get a study group. That's what Daisy, Max, Leo, and Jane do. Daisy is the basketball player that everyone wants to be friends with. Max is the shy guy who happens to be Daisy's best friend. Leo is a guy with an ego the size of a school bus, and Jane is a movie star's daughter and is afraid that's all she'll ever be. These people have nothing in common but they all become friends. Then during the SATs, it got out that someone cheated. Who cheated and what happens to the person involved with this?This book was a crazy book about stressing over tests and what almost every normal high school student goes through. I recommend this book to anyone who is freaking out over exams or the SATs because it's a chance to get a laugh over the whole process."
4,jackie chan movie,"my husband loves all jackie chan movies, the movie was in good shape thanks so much, i would order again.."
5,I'm delighted,"I am always looking for CD's of Deep House Music, guys like Kevin Yost, Harley & Muscle, etc; and it's no secret that the supply of CD's are drying up. Fans of Deep House should be gratified to know that Argentina (of all places) remains a rich source of their music, and House Jazz Masters is a perfect example."
3,Von Mondo 2,Beautiful music!Unfortunatly the box of the cd was broken...Anyway the delivery was rapid and the cd in good condition.Thank's a lotAle
1,Be very careful what you order!,"I became an instant Giorgia fan after I saw her sing with Luciano Pavarotti on his second ""Pavarotti and Friends"" concert, several years ago. When I saw that she had released a live ""MTV Unplugged"" DVD, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When I received my order, I opened the box, took off the wrapper, and popped the disc in my DVD player. The front panel read ""error"",and the TV screen read ""Not NTSC"". I instantly learned that there are different formats of DVDs. The one I received was a PAL format, used in Europe and other countries, and not playable in DVD machines in the U.S. Since I had opened the package, neither the seller or Amazon will give me a refund. I looked up the item again, on Amazon.com, and it said that the format was NTSC. Now, I am out over thirty bucks and cannot enjoy this concert. If you ever order this DVD, please be absolutely sure it will work in your player."
3,A little rough around the edges,"I love Giorgia's voice but this album falls a bit short for her. Not woefully bad, but her studio work is much more polished. This live set has some fun moments and it is nice to hear her sing some songs in English. Stevie Wonder's appearance was a pleasant surprise, too!"
4,"A Region 1 release would be better, but...","This is an excellent concert and I suggest any Giorgia fan add it to his or her collection. The concert contains many popular songs from throughout Giorgia's career as well as several popular American songs. Many of the songs are more energetic than the studio-edits and being able to see her perform them is a special bonus.Regarding DVD Region problems, one can always view the DVD on his computer. After inserting the DVD, if you computer isn't set to the appropriate region, you will be prompted to switch regions. Be careful though, since you are only able to switch a limited number of times (about 5). There are also programs that allow you to rip DVDs and burn region-free copies, though I'm not sure how legal that is..."
3,All edited for TV movies,Seen this before. None of these four movies are full length.All run about 53 minutes.That being said and if you just want to watch some old Roy Rogers movies these are in good shape. Each movie on a single disk.But if you are looking for full length movies forget it
1,rare roy rogers movies,why on earth dont they release the full length versions of roy rogers movies NOT the cut versions his movies run between 65 to 75 min. not 56 min.this is a great loss not to restore his movies he made 19 color movies get these movies restored befor they are all gone.
4,The Perfect Accompaniment!,"Mr. Friedman did a wonderful job on this novelization! The scenes he added may have been a bit wordy at times, but they provided glimpses into the characters' psyche and relationships. Some particular highlights were the ""Then: Nineteen Years Ago"" sequence, the scenes which described the assimilation of Agron Lumas's family, and the beginings of Seven's and Kim's relationship. As a studier of culture myself, I enjoyed following the doctor's quest for a holiday. Some circumstances were quite amusing! Some situations, including the creation of a subspace field, were somewhat confusing to one who doesn't understand engineering terms, but not so much that they took away from the plot. I enjoyed the focus on Torres and Paris, being a P/T fan. Overall, this is a well-written book, and the perfect accompaniment to the episode."
4,A good Trekker read. Nice insight into TV vs. books.,"Having little bad to say about anything Star Trek, my review will be biased, but if you watch the television episode and then read this book, you will realize what readers have always known: Books are much better than TV! While the entire script (pretty much) is in this novel, Michael Jan Friedman's and Jeri Taylor's story goes into so much more depth about the aliens and their motivations that you find yourself at least *understanding* why they acted as they did. A sub-subplot reveals another slice of the Holodoc, and his on-going quest to augment his programming, which is totally absent from the TV episode. Of course, the Tom & B'Elanna plotline will certainly keep the attention of all the Paris/Torres fans, but that's not all there is to this story."
2,bracelet,I did like the bracelet: although the price definitely matches the product. I was disappointed to find that the silver charms with wording on them were made of plastic.
2,Great Modern Look But Expensive,These pulls are perfect for modern slab cabinet door and drawer fronts. I was disappointed by the quality of the pulls. Similar pulls are available for a fraction of the price.
5,Great Product !,Handy organizer for me. Each shelf can come out and has its own locking lid. Very handy and very sturdy.
5,Very Pleased,This Craft Cart is perfect for keeping my stamping items tidy and organized. I have my stamps organized by themes and now keep each theme in a separate drawer. I also have plenty of room for my 12 x 12 craft paper. I love that each drawer has a lid making it easier to bring to another place. I am very satisfied with this purchase and as my hobby expands will plan to order another one!
2,Arrived broken,The product arrived broken and was returned. Amazon makes returns a breeze! That is one important reason why I buy from Amazon.
5,Organizer with lided bins,We love this product for its ease of use and portability. We especially like that idea that you can grab one bin to work with and not have to worry about the contents falling out as each bin has its own lid. We use it mostly for filing of paperwork and it works well. I believe it is designed as a craft organizer and could see how it would work well for that purpose as well. I would recommend it for anyone trying to keep things organized and together.
5,Moveable Cart,"This item is excellent to use as ""junk drawers"" for all those little items that sit around that you want out of sight. I took the lids off. Is easy to move about and small enough to roll into a closet under short items. With the lids on it could be a drawer to grab and go if you have a project going."
4,Convenient and modular,"This is great for storage. It rolls very smoothly and freely and stacks nicely with other Sterilite drawer units. Overall a very good product, though it does feel a little bit flimsy, it's no more flimsy than and of their other storage that you may be familiar with and it doesn't make me nervous."
4,It works!,"I thought it was just like another set that I have but it's a little bit smaller (the drawers). It still works, the other one just gives the pages a little bit more space."
4,Ungaro Senso,"I love this scent. Another great scent from the 80s, the pink one also is very nice from Ungaro, I found a larger bottle for a better buy at Thefragrancefactory.com otherwise I would give this 5 stars."
4,works fine if you use the right batteries,"The reviews here seem to be mostly reviewing the detonator problem with the quarry mountain set rather than the train cars of this set, so I thought I'd better pass the word on here: according to reviewers of the rock quarry set, this problem is fixed by using Rayovac Maximum Plus batteries. Don't know why, but there you go."
4,Double Eagle,"Frankly, this book is not up to the standards of the others. I expected more flying stuff, with accurate technical details. The story was good, but the flying was not up to my expectations."
2,This Book Has An Unsavory Sexist FLavor,"This book would be entertaining for lower-level readers, and contains some truth. However, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth because some ideas permeate it that, in my opinion, are sexist. I would not recommend that any parents give this book to their sons if they want to teach them to genuinely respect women."
1,It lacked its buildup.,"No positive spiritualism, here. Just an adventure story where boys know best, and a foreign culture managed by women and girls depicts all strong women as pushy idiots. Skip this one."
4,Attack Of The Amazons by Gilbert Morris touches the soul.,Gilbert Morris takes his readers predetermined beliefs of human equality and places it in the realm of the spiritual. It's content teaches teen s to look not to the world for truth but to God's Word. I rate it as an 8 because as an adult the subject matter was not as deep as I am generally used to reading. For young teens it is the perfect level of reading to keep them interested and still learn spiritual truths by which to live their lives. Well worth giving to any teen interested in science fiction but striving to follow God's plan for their lives.
3,Too Little Variety,"As a fan of Les Rita since the late 80's, and a owner of their entire discography, I must say that I really enjoy the quirky, off-beat character of their earlier efforts. To me, its what has set them apart as a creative duo. Now ""Variety"" offers very little of this quality, as the songs are accessible (perhaps too much so); I found this lack of edgy-soulfulness so apparent in their earlier works, disappointing. I unhappily agree with the 2 previous reviews that this would be a good introduction to novice listeners who may be more comfortable with a more mainstream vibe."
3,POOR SOUND QUALITY HURTS THESE TUNES,"Here's proof that what sounds like a great idea on paper can flop when transferred to compact disc. The tunes on these recordings have been culled from Liza's mom's '60s small-screen variety series, but the less-than-stellar sound quality hurts, making them more grating than gracious. The rambling bits of dialogue feel hollow and disconnected when heard out of context; those wanting to hear Judy sing these songs should watch her as well. Geneon Entertainment will take die-hard devotees over the rainbow --- they have released Judy's entire ill-fated series on DVD, proving you can go home again. And again. And again."
1,An exercise in self-indulgence.,"Sadly, Ms. Shapiro's memoir, misses the target completely. Reeking of insincerity, this neatly bound package is all too trite for my tastes. With little remorse, and absolutely no humility, I'm not exactly sure why Ms. Shapiro chose to publish this account(money?). A life of privilege, discarded, for the `fast-life' of cocaine, booze, and the lavish gifts of a much-older and married man gives me no call to sympathy. That she `found her way out' through personal tragedy may be admirable---I'm happy for her, but hardly front page news. A fast read, even the one-hour I spent with Ms. Shapiro was a waste of my time."
2,"Superficial, flighty with nothing to give. Who Cares?","Does anyone really care about a spoiled, rich kid who has an affair with her supposed best friend's stepfather, is obsessed with her blond, blue-eyed 'foxy' looks and who's biggest worry on the first day of reattending college, is what to wear? (the designer jacket or the high heels??) Oh please! Books like this give memoirs a tacky name. I suppose the only redeeming factor is knowing that people like Dani Shapiro actually do exist. That there are folks out there who have always had money, someone to look out for them and no conscience. Shapiro keeps stressing her religious background but this memoir is a spiritual wasteland. What is meant to come across as cute and touching is really obnoxious and empty. What is cute is her writing style. Sort of Cosmo magazine. This is a great Cosmo piece although I know I wouldn't want my daughter reading it. Where is the merit? Enough said."
2,Slow Motion skims the surface superficially,"I am a Dani Shapiro fan. After reading Playing With Fire I thought to myself, ""Wow. I bet this girl had an interesting life!"" I was so excited when I heard she was publishing her biography. I thought, ""At last, I get to find out the true story."" Instead, I felt like I got a watered down version of Playing With Fire. I finished the book wanting more. She and ""Jess"" were supposedly so close, yet she didn't go into any detail of their friendship. She was supposedly so repulsed by ""Lenny"" when she first met him, but didn't let the reader in on how she came to fall in love with him. Too much style, not enough substance. I wanted juicy ""memoir"" style detail and I didn't get it."
2,Just Okay,"Reading this book, you get the feeling the writer spent a little too much time with Jacqueline Susann novels in her youth. Same sensibility, but with literary pretensions piled on. Whew! Bad combination. Valley of the Dolls was at least honest about what it was--and a lot more fun."
3,A serviceable companion for a trip along the Oregon Trail,"This publication of the National Park Service gives a park visitor somewhat deeper information about Westward Expansion, a theme interpreted at about 15 national park units. It has maps of the main overland trails, along with about 50 pages of text. There are lots of pictures of national park units and reproductions of some period paintings.The text provides a serviceable introduction to the topic--why Euro-Americans moved West, how they traveled, the challenges they faced, and so on. Like most books in this genre, it provides an almost-entirely Euro-American perspective with some token reference to the Indians whose lives were disrupted and then destroyed."
4,"Tresor, Vol. 1: The Techno Sound of Berlin (A Tresor Kompilation)","This album was made up originally from tracks licensed from renowned Berlin trance label MFS. This classic CD is a must for early ravers as it contains some great underground sounds from Berlins first techno club Tresor in 1992. Track 12 ""Don't Panic by Mindgear"" is a must for anyone's collection. So put on your Converse One Stars with the whole in the soul, you're baggy pants, and your oversized shirt with a pill on the front, your backpack with the skateboard in between, don ya cap, go to your favourite farmers field and pick some treats and come home […]."
3,Early 90s Techno Sounds,"If you're looking for some current Berlin techno or dubbed out beats that you would expect from tech-house this is not what you're going to get. This is no doubt early 90s techno with its 4/4, in your face beats. Nothing laid back about this. I have a personal preference for some of the more laid back sounds coming from Berlin/Koln/Frankfurt and other part of Germany. I think I'll have to be in the mood for this one."
4,My morning get the engines started juice,Have been a fan of Lavazza for several years. Had been cheating and using the Gran Crema espresso pods with our latte machine. Thought I should try using the whole beans and grinding myself to reduce the packaging that I was contributing to the landfills. I miss the convenience of the pods but the taste is just as good and it has the desired effect of waking me up and making me tolerable in the world's view.
1,Something is terribly wrong!,"This was one of the worst tasting coffee's I have ever tried. Something must be wrong with the batch, mis packed or everyone else who reviewed this is nuts.I have to assume there was some kind of problem with the beans. It was bland and lacked flavor. The beans looked nothing like any espresso beans I have ever seen. No real crema, yuck.Sending them back, why suffer?"
1,Lavazza is a poor choice,"This is about the worst expresso coffee i have tried.Was looking to see a dark Italian roasted coffee but it is not a true dark roast. The color is brown-tan and does not even taste like an expresso. I use a Gaggia Baby machine for many years and have tried many different coffees including other Lavazzas but this is a poor excuse for an Italian type expresso. Starbucks is better, and that is a stretch.AL."
4,installed on 98 impreza,"installed myself in a 98 impreza whose factory struts had completely gone, with a proper alignment the ride is much better. still not floating on air but not all over the road either. OEM springs."
1,Deer Stag Krypton's Slip-On,"Well, they are sort of comfortable, but non slip is a stretch, they put me on the floor from the ""Git Go""(or DAY ONE)!The kitchen is a dangerous place(I'm a professional chef), but with these on your feet, you need to be on your toes!JMHO,"
4,More please,"I'm a big fan of Mr. David and I have to say this book didn't disappoint. I was a little put off at first worrying that the author had suddenly found God and he was just writing this novel to sermonize. This is not the case. The author needed to use the deeply religious main characters in order to make the story work. Even though the novel is 500 + pages long, you get caught up in the story and end up reading it at a roller coaster pace. I was actually disappointed when the novel ended. The only negative review of the novel I have is that he introduced too many side plots that went nowhere and they really didn't get resolved. He packed so many story lines into the novel, that it might have been better if he had turned it into a trilogy, so that he could have hashed out in a little more detail the nuggets of great ideas. Hopefully, he will write a sequel."
1,"Weak plot, weak science ... very disappointing","This books makes a weak attempt to jump on the money wagon of Left Behind. It fails miserably in several ways. First, the plot has nothing to do with anything in the bible. If you enjoyed Left Behind, this book will only annoy you. The plot wanders around making the reader think it might pick up and get interesting. It doesn't.Technical parts of the plot are annoying as well. For example, an ohm meter is used to check voltage on a fence. The author needs to get his basic electrical concepts straight before writing stuff like this. Other science in the book is similar, with vague references to data that really mean nothing or are simply wrong.Overall, the book reads like it is the author's first attempt at writing a novel. Some characters are good, but the plot development and foundation is so weak the characters can't succeed in salvaging it."
5,Great Book,"I think that this is a great book. As a nonchristian who loves apocalyptic novels, this one was not too religious (as was the Left Behind series), but it has the good versus evil thing going. The best part about the book was that the christians were not too perfect...I mean who ever met a perfect christian anyway? I love the fact that the author seemed to identify with Reverend Maitland's point of view and religious beliefs, but did not put down the Fellowship with their extremely conservative ides. The scifi aspect made it extremely enjoyable, the only complaint I have is that I would love to hear more about life in the settlement."
3,Way too new age,"This CD is good, though I didn't like it as much as everyone else, apparently. I was really hoping for something more Indian. Except for a couple of songs, this is more new age ""global"" than I like (dreamy sound effects, orchestras, etc.) If you want something Indian with a beat I highly recommend Midival punditz and the Asian Massive CD. Krishna Lila, if you're considering that too, is very traditional Indian music with hardly any beat at all. Tabla Beat Science is good also, but much more beat than melody."
5,"Great Album... If you liked ""Realize"" you will like this one","I pre-ordered this album without even sampling it. I knew it's going to be a great one and yes it was. It's like a musical journey. You have to listen to it a few times and it will grow on you. The music arrangment is marvelous, the fusion between traditional and modern styles is just perfect. All in all a great investment for your soul. I highly recommend it.Listen to it loud!"
2,Whale sounds,"This music is pretty intelligent, but not very interesting. The forgettable melodies hardly connect with the complex rhythm lines; on only one or two occasions on the cd satisfying harmonies come across.I bought this together with Nitin Sawhney's ""Beyond Skin"", which is an incomparably better cd - Sawhney plugs in nicely with earlier work from Portishead, Hooverphonic, and even the Roots. Karsh Kale however, seems to pay tribute to Jean Michel Jarre's ""Waiting for Cousteau"".During yoga, my teacher wallpapers her lesson with a whale sounds-cd. When I do yoga at home, Karsh Kale is a neat substitute for that."
2,you've got to be kidding me!,"sorry this might be harsh but on my initial listen i knew this was something i didn't want. its got that ""over the top"" produced feel to it. lots of neat effects and great sound but nothing much else. its not a real deep listening experience. its cliche. the fusion just went a bit too far here. after repeated listens it just went completely flat. this would make a wonderful sound track for disney's aladdin.i'll gladly trade this cd for any of the thornton and ramzy cd's."
5,Organic Electronica,"I'll be the first to admit that I don't usually listen to electronic music. I often find the music cold and distant.But I was in a music funk. Sick of the 1400 songs on my iPod (who'd a thunk it?), I bought this album, my first CD purchase in almost a year.To say this album is electronic would do it no justice. Yes, it's electronic but it's also very organic. Kale mixes break beats with tablas. He uses synths AND sitars. And the vocals are heartbreaking, like Indian opera. Yes, on paper, it sounds very strange.But the result is a truly beautiful album that is probably the most original record I've heard in years. All I can say is pick up this album because it'll amaze you!"
5,A truly liberating musical journey through sound...,"Liberation is a truly liberating musical journey through sound from beginning to end... I have all of his cds (I do believe) including Tabla Beat Science... To me this cd shows a direction of growth for Kale, both in producing and musicianship... I've yet to see him live, and one day I hope too... For Karsh has fused the East and West seamlessly... Traditional Indian music melded with future electronic sounds and music... It has a vast inclusion of instrumentation from violin/a chamber orchestra, bass, various drums, sarod, sitar + a few more... So I do recommend this cd to any nu world music/south asian beats cd dj or lovers of that genre - cheers and happy new year - DJ Dakini-NYC aka Savannah Skye..."
5,not stick pot spoon,"Wonderful spoon, use almost all the time. very durable. easy to handle, sturdy and easy to clean. Was cautous in buying this one... but glad I did."
5,Plantronics products are always first class,I have used these ear buds for two years and have always found them to be very comfortable with an excellent fit plus great transmission of sound under a variety of noisy conditions.
1,Sucks!,"This drive failed after 5 month of usage. The disk was very fast connected to my Dual G5 via Firewire 800.Personaly i dont like Raids anymore, they are more insecure.Get something good as Seagate or a External eSata drive."
1,Disgustingly poor engineering,"I had a horrid experience with this drive. Bought this as a backup for my server. Failed in 8 months with all my data (research data no less). Forensics found that the drive I/O controller failed corrupting my data.I won't buy Seagate/Maxtor again, period."
1,Zero Stars is more like it.,"I bought this drive and within 7-8 months, it died. I lost everything. Luckily it was still under warranty so they shipped me a new one. (no data recovery). Within 3 months, the new drive died. All I get is a repetitive clicking noise and a blinking light. It won't mount on any computer. READ CAREFULLY: if you return a bad drive and they send you a new one, your warranty expires. That's why I'm giving it zero stars. It failed not once, but twice. Largest waste of money. I've tried other drives and have had them crash as well but not consistently like this one. I don't think there's any drive out there that's ""solid"". The drives that seem to work best for me are Lacie. Even though I lost a 500 gig Lacie drive once, I now have (2) 500 gig drives that back up nightly. That's the cheapest way you will be able to recover anything if a drive goes down. Biggest advice: buy 2 of the same drives and mirror them. Just don't buy a maxtor."
4,Firewire conflict but otherwise so far so good!,"I was a bit worried about this drive at first. Connected to my mac with FW 800 it would not mount after I restarted my computer. However, as others have mentioned, this seems to be a conflict with other FW devices. When I switched it to the USB 2 cord it worked fine, mounted everytime. Just a bummer I can't use the FW 800 cord without the hassle of a work around. The work around is: unmount before you shutdown reboot, then unplug the drive from you machine, turn it off. After you restart, plug the drive back in and restart it."
3,functions well,The storage capcity is great. However one wishes all the backup associated programs were explained somewhere
5,Maxtor One Touch III 1TB,"I think no matter what brand of HD you buy there is always a chance that HD will fail. A lot can happen in between the factory and your desk. For the guy who lost all his data, maybe yours got dropped in the store warehouse. I have been using Maxtor for years and anyone using Mac in the 90's was as well because they were the standard HD in most of their machines at that time. Further I wouldn't trust software to run my backup's anyway. I'll admit I know nothing about the software, maybe I would be happy using it, but I work with PS3 and manually organize my files in Bridge using this HD as a mirrored 500 GB HD and I feel safe. Also it is whisper quiet, is built really well and hey they stack nicely and it is nice to look at. As a seasoned working photographer I say buy it, you'll be just fine."
5,I enjoy the safety it provides,"I love the 1TB I have. I use it in a raid 1 setup which gives me 500GB to work with and then I have partioned that to mirror my laptop harddrive and also leave me with extra storage space. It is very comforting to know that even if my laptop drive failed or if it was stolen or smashed or whatever, I could simply boot from the mirrored drive on the Maxtor and it would be like I was at my computer immedietly. I like the security of having the computer in a raid 1 setup so that if a drive fails it is backed up on its twin. I have too much to lose without it."
1,This Drive Totally sucks,"Very slow, less than 5MB's a second! I returned the first one to Maxtor, I'm now on my Third and same issue.. They all mount under OSX but do not work anywhere near USB or Firewire speeds. I have tried the same drives on all three of my macs, Maxtors hardware is just total junk. DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE.At this point, I am scrapping the chipset and keeping the bare drives to intall in a media raid. So far Maxtor is batting a 1000 for failing on me. I will never buy another Maxtor product.FYI-- their tech support is horrible."
1,"MAXTOR will destroy your data, they are terrible","Maxtor One touch III drives are terrible. I have two - they broke within a year - in the 11th month of my owning them. I lost all the data. They won't replace them, because their warranty is for one year from the date of manufacture- not purchase. Clever, no? I bought them from Amazon. Maxtor won't stand behind them. Their customer service is awful. The last message I got back from them was in spanish. I STRONGLY recommend that you don't buy a maxtor drive. I will never again buy one. I wish I read the messages here, before I bought them."
1,"Stick to your OEM business, Maxtor","What can I say... poor software, horrible installation experience (installation crashed 3 times on my XP SP3 Dell XPS machine), drive disappear and won't wake, and very noisy. Overall seems like Maxtor has no idea what a good user experience is and their website is also worthless. Compared to my Buffalo external drive, which works without any software installed, this thing feels like a ""beta"".Maxtor, you make good harddrives for PC and you should stick to that business only, stop trying to make a product directly for the average consumer because you failed!"
1,Avoid at any price,I just lost my warranty replacement drive (and all data) the second time. My experience is that the disks work just long enough to load them up with data and then they turn into inert bricks. Maxtor replaced my first drive but their automated warranty replacement web site says I can't get the replacement replaced so I'm out my data and my money.
1,"Oh, OneTouch III, why do you suck so bad?","This is the third Maxtor OneTouch III that I have had the misfortune of dealing with. Today, the third one has died. No warning, just a clicking noise, and then the top white light starts to flash.""kernel[0]: disk3s3: I/O error."" is what you'll see in /var/log/system.log. I'm used to it because the other two units met with the same fate.Thank god for backups - but they're on a Western Digital unit. At least it still works, unlike these heaps of cow manure."
1,Don't Do It.,"I bought four of these about a year and a half ago.The last one died today.Two were replaced under warranty shortly after I received them. I should have returned all four right then.Three of the four failed shortly after the expiry of the warranty, all within a month or two of each other. The last one made it until last week, I've pronounced it dead today. That makes just over eighteen months for the best of the batch.The kicker is that once one of the drives inside this RAID device fails, all is lost. Even if it is configured for RAID mode. Turns out, your data is still just fine on the remaining good drive, but the only way to get it out of there is by paying Maxtor for their ""data recovery services.""Captive. Audience. Scam."
2,Not one-touch,"I bought a Maxtor product assuming that it would function like the100GB and 200GB products that I had purchased previously -- walk upto a PC, turn on the Maxtor, connect the USB cables, and it's done.Unfortunately, since this terabyte drive came pre-formatted for a Mac,I had to install their software, re-format the Maxtor, and thenit became a ""one-touch"" product.Maxtor should sell products that are consistent with their originalphilosophy, i.e. sell a ""one-touch"" drive in two editions -- onepre-formatted for the PC, one for the Mac, and whatever otherpre-formatted flavors.It's nice to tinker with computers and hard drives, but as an end-userI expect the product to be useful out-of-the-box. That's why I wasloyal to the Maxtor brand.Unfortunately, a one-touch product it's not.Other than that, it seems to be working fairly reliably as mytertiary-storage device."
1,Buy something else,"Be warned: the warranty service on this drive is dreadful. Not because it's slow, but because the 'refurbished' replacement is likely to be worthless. The USB/Firwire interface on my first drive failed after 6 months. I'm now on my fourth round: none of the three replacement drives (each sent in a flimsy box) have even passed the supplied diagnostics. One sounded like a small lawnmower, another wouldn't format. Good luck finding someone other than 'Sean' from Hyderabad to talk to."
1,Stay Away,My first drive had the same diagnostic error as everyone who has reported here within 3 months. 1st replacement had the same error within 3 days (refurbished). 2nd replacement had same error 1st day (refurbished). 3rd friggin refurbished replacement I've received today had the same dang error. I'll be making another call tomorrow. Stay away from this at all cost.
1,Maxtor should be ashamed at selling a product with such obvious flaws and problems,"Similar experience as many here- bought it as backup unit. Worked fine for 2-3 months and then failed- clicking noises, computer wouldn't recognize. I spent time troubleshooting- finally sent it back. Received another which did the same thing. I was told that the warranty was one year regardless of how many faulty units I received and had to return.Seems this is not an isolated issue and yet the company keeps selling these units with no remorse. So do we begin a class action law suit?Do NOT buy this product. I bought LaCie drive which is still working 4 years later and am a big fan of the passport flash drives. While access time is not superfast, they are reliable- especially if using as backups..."
1,This is a Great Drive! (if you don't really care about your data),"Like a great many people here, my Maxtor drive failed within the first 6 months of light usage. They're very good about replacing your failed drive, and they'll even give you cost estimatefor recovering your data (that their drive was suppose to securely store) - I think the minimum charge is $700, payable up front.And guess what, when they send you that replacement drive the warranty on it is computed from the purchase date of the original drive you bought - you know - the one that failed. One can only wonder how they manage to stay in business; more than that, how they are even ALLOWED to stay in business. If you can stand to continue looking at the drive after it dies - and it will be soon - it'll make a good doorstop"
1,Don't buy it!,"All my external drives in the past have been Maxtors. So, when I researched my purchase for my first 1TB drive, I didn't think much of the reviews I came upon warning of the failure rate of their 1TB drives. I've had this drive for about 5 months now. I use it to manually back up my files and only do it about once a month, so it has not seen a lot of use. One day it just decided to quit. It makes a bunch of clicking noises and that's about it. I'm going to have to return it for a replacement, but it certainly doesn't inspire much confidence in my replacement, wondering when the next time it's going to fail. I would rather get a different drive. I certainly won't buy Maxtor again."
1,Garbage. You will feel victimized.,"I just had a run-in with Maxtor. After purchasing their drive, it failed within 6 months. I was then told that I would be charged a MINIMUM of $700. Data recovery, you see, is apparently not covered by the warranty. If you attempt to recover it anywhere else, since they have to open the drive to do it, you're no longer under the warranty.I was then told by them that I should never rely upon one backup unit. THE POINT WAS THAT IT WAS THE BACKUP UNIT! For such an expensive item, I think I deserve more service.The best part was when the tech didn't even bother to try to help. Why bother? They'll get rich off of me by forcing me to send it off to recover the data."
2,This drive falls asleep,This drive falls asleep and then has to be unplugged and remounted before you can start working again. I have contacted Maxtor and they stated it was a known issue with no solution...I generally prefer Maxtor's external drives but stay away from this one...It's a dog
1,8 months & this drive failed!,I had good experiences with Maxtor large capacity external drives but this one failed in less than 8 months. Drive kept on this repetitive clicking noises and two of my computers could not recognize this drive.Good thing this dude can be returned for warranty replacement but all my data is lost!
1,"Bad, bad, bad",I bought two drives. One for backup of course. Sic weeks ago the main drive fails. No problem! I have a backup. Got an RMA and new refurbished unit.Two nights ago The rplacement fails again. I'm getting very frustrated. I have a backup though. After calling to get another rma I check the backup just to be safe.Guess what? The diagnostic tool tells me my backup is failing!Stay away from these!
4,"Very complete, clear, and very usable for the builder.","Marvelously complete treatment of boat design information and the scantling rules needed for the serious boat builder.Gerr provides building information for every aspect of a wide range of boat types (excluding multihulls, as he notes). He provides the rules and the tables/graphs needed to eliminate complex calculations needed to determine the size and stength that each piece of the boat should be.A must read for the small boatbuilding shop owner or wannabe designer."
5,hard to find excellence,An excellent book of reference that is almost impossible to find in single or multiple publications. From an author who has the hands on as well as the academic qualifications.
2,"Very Technical, not for the hobbyist","This book is very technical. I bought it to gain some knowledge about boat building as a hobby. I guess that if you are an engineer you would have a better understanding of the various graphs and instruction, but it wasn't that way for me. Just take this as a warning that if you want something simple to read, this is not the book. Maybe if I were to have built a few boats (which I have not (yet)) I would have a better understanding of the topic.Only two stars because it was not what I expected, not because it was not topic orientated."
4,"The Elements of Boat Strength: For Builders, Designers, and Owners",Its a good book but I can imagine some difficulties to people not affine with this subject.I have no problem as a Naval Architect.
5,"JAMMING WITH MICK, BILL, RY, CHARLIE & NICKY. A+++","Jamming With Edward? On CD? From Pointblank Classics? Now who would ever think we would see this lil' ditty releasedon CD? Well, it makes perfect sense since the Stones are with Virgin Records right? Right. Well this cool album was originallyissued on Rolling Stones Records back in '72 and is just a 'romping' jam by Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman andfriends Ry Cooder & Nicky Hopkins, and it is super cool! The 6 lil' tunes are interesting and if there ever was a legal Stones'boot' release to see just what some of the boys did in their spare time, this is it! No more said. Throw it on and dig one moretime the 6 lil' tunes especially ""It Hurts Me Too"" it is way too cool! The complete original album liner notes by Mick areincluded along with new liner notes on the history of how this interesting lil' jolly release came about in the first place."
3,Jamming With Edward,"This is an interesting time capsule of the Rolling Stones rehearsing after Brian Jone's death. As the liner notes say, they spent about $2.98 making the album so they thought they could only justify selling it for $3.98. It includes some excellent slide guitar by Ry Cooder and piano work by Nicky Hopkins, but is otherwise droll and would only interest the most die hard Stones fan."
3,jamminalonestones,great jam disc from 69. everytime i listen to it it makes me weep to think of all the stuff the stones did in the studio that will never see the light of official release if that. if ya dig the hits this aint a disc for you. without brian and keith there its a different band. this is from a very transitional era. its all groove. not quite funky enough without the human riff but a great listen and a must for stones junkies.
2,For Ry Cooder Fans,"If you are a fan of Ry Cooder, buy this CD. If you are a Stones collector, consider buying this CD. Otherwise, forget it. Mick ""sings"" on two cuts, but his vocals are half-hearted and buried in the mix. After all, this is just some musicians noodling around in the studio (as legend tells it, they were waiting for Keith Richards to show up in the studio). Mick didn't want it released (another legend), but the others demanded so here we have it. Mostly instrumental blues noodling around, you won't find yourself listening to this alot."
2,"Fun, but forgettable","This is a fun, loose record. But worth 5 stars? Not a chance. Unless you like listening to bands jam in practice rooms for extended periods."
5,Hot...Really hot lunch.,"Being a truck driver,I have used a few of these types of boxes.Let me just say that in about an hour,your soup or sandwich will be hot.Any longer and you will have to wait for it to cool down.Other boxes I usedtook 2-3 hours just to get it very warm.The only thing I cant comment on yet is durability.Ive had various other brands burn out from one month to one year.Well just have to see how this one lasts.Mind you I use it almost every day.Also note it dosent cool,were other types heat/cool.I didntpay attention to the dimentions,and its a little small,but were talking sandwiches or left over pizza,not whole meals."
3,Which Hurricane?,Hello....what book is this? Is it about hurricane Hugo? I need lots of info about hurricane Hugo! Now!
3,good,It is good yoga DVD but it could be better. It could be more variable and I need a little harder level. It is not exactly what I was looking for. Not challenging enough for me. Thank you.
1,don't buy it!,"I have practiced a little yoga over the years and was never much of a fan, however when I noticed I had lost a lot of flexibility I decided it was time to come back and sadly I picked this dvd. First of all, the ""style"" is all wrong for me--they talk through the entire session and move through the poses very quickly. What ever happened to ""hold""? Also, I only realize NOW, after reading these reviews, that this is their ""greatest hits"" packaged for extra revenue. Gaiam will get no more ""revenue"" from me."
1,You will not be fit with this DVD!!!!,"As the other reviewers have posted this DVD is plagued with problems, from the poor presentation to the actual workouts. The order of the workouts are totally wrong according to the sleeve, in addition the workouts are just poorly described and feel rushed all throughout. I did 2 of the workouts back to back and did not break a sweat at all, so to say that they will keep you fit...maybe you can do them right before bedtime and maybe they will make you feel a tad limber...SAVE YOUR MONEY...THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS OUT THERE!!!"
1,"boring and easy, please do not waste your money.","This DVD should come with a disclaimer that it is only suitable for beginners or elderly. The so-called ""weight loss"" segments didn't get my heart rate up at all and almost put me to sleep. The ""chapters"" are really difficult to figure out as they are not labeled and the voice over doesnt tell you which segment you are doing. Instead of buying this horrible DVD, sit in front of a picture of the ocean, play some Enya and try to touch your toes."
4,A Good Resource...,"...once you figure out which workout is which. I was quite confused when I first started working with this DVD because the workout descriptions on the back cover do not match the workouts as they're numerically ordered on the DVD. It's definitely a shortcoming in the editing that the workouts are only numbered, and not titled. Having said that, now that I've gotten to know the sessions, I find this a good resource. It's particularly good for traveling, because there is a nice selection from which to choose. Below is the index, as I have come to know the DVD. I hope this helps other users!1. AM Peak Performance (Rod Stryker)2. PM Weight Loss (Suzanne Deason)3. PM Peak Performance (Rod Stryker)4. AM Yoga for Weight Loss (Suzanne Deason)5. Stress Relief Yoga (Suzanne Deason)"
5,"Nala is adorable, so soft and fuzzy!","Nala is so cute and cuddly, I just love her! I love the fact that she has a larger size to her than most Lion King toys which makes her nice to sit in a corner of a room. She is made with such soft, fuzzy material! Also she has beautiful bright green eyes and a pink nose, with a cute curious expression on her face. It really is a great offer to get something so good for free! I picked Nala over Simba because I think she is cuter, plus I like the way she is posed better, in a sitting position."
2,Disney Lion King LARGE JUMBO Plush Nala Doll,"This item is soft and cudley - but if you are looking for a LARGE JUMBO stuffed lion - the title is VERY misleading. My fault, I should have read the details a little closer. I am only returning it because my grand daughter wanted a VERY LARGE lion for Christmas. I didn't want to disappoint her."
2,not worth the money,"I definitely thought the animal would have been a LOT bigger for the price. definitely wouldn't buy again.bought for a 2 year old who loves lion king and she was scared of it. i am sure she'll grow to love it withage, but still not worth the money for the small size."
4,An indication of things to come...,"The Dirty Sweet E.P. is a rerelease of the debut 12"" release from Australian rock outfit Jet. From the blistering guitar intro of ""Take It Or Leave It"" their distinct raw rock sound is easy to pick. Borrowing heavily from influences such as the Rolling Stones, but at the same time bringing a fresh new outlook on rock music, Jet are definitely a band to look out for in the next decade. This E.P. is a great precursor to their forthcoming album ""Get Born"" and I highly recommend it."
5,jet - full speed ahead,"this cd is new to my collection, yet does not feel that way. the music is upbeat, yet soothing and seems very familiar. the music is a perfect blend of sounds new and old, and the music will last a very long time in listeners' ears."
3,My daughter still kicks these off,"They are super cute shoes at a great price, but they certainly don't stay on my 10 month old as I was hoping. They have a tiny bit of adjustability in them, which I like. Who knows, maybe when she's too busy walking she won't want to kick them off."
4,Nice Portable Parts Storage,"Nice locking compartments. Locking front cover, plus storagein the top compartment. Only drawback, I wish it was a little wider."
5,delightful story,"I really enjoyed this book. The story was original and the characters well developed. I was laughing out loud at times. Claire was just a delight. Tom was her hero with a cast of characters that were not a t all what the reader usually finds in historical westerns. Easy reading and very much enjoyed. This author is consistent, I amyet yo be disappointed"
5,"Great stools, great price!",The stools are very sturdy and comfortable. They are well built. They were cheap too compared to other saddle seat stools I saw elsewhere for $50 each!
3,Good for the money,"The counterstools are very pretty. One gets what you pay for. They are worth the money. However, they are fine for adults only. I have small grandchildren and they tip over when they try to get on them. They are very light weight."
3,Basic but nice,"For the price, these are fine. They are basic and relatively sturdy. I think the materials come from China and then they are assembled in the USA with an air nail gun. Those nail holes and shiny nails are visible, so I filled the holes with wood putty.I own a nicer stool of the same design but shorter. The wood on that stool is of better quality and thicker. It is also assembled with screws, not nails, and those screws are placed in less visible locations. The finish is also better. I wish I could remember where I got that one because I would have ordered two taller ones from them instead of these two. I know the price I paid on that one was comparable."
1,"Advertized as Quality, NOT TRUE!!!!","If you used this 1 or 2 days a year it MIGHT be OK. The truth is this.. My first one came unstitched the FIRST day in my shop on the middle pocket. The seller sent me a new one. After 10 weeks in the cabinet shop with EVERYDAY use the replacement is coming apart. There are shreds of stitching inside ALL the pockets and the compartments are no longer seperated, because the stitching between them has let go. No, I am not placing sharp tools inside that are damaging the pockets. Do NOT buy this product, it is 100% pure junk. John ( cabinet builder )"
1,Fast Cap Ballistic,I purchased 4 of these aprons for the workers in my shop. They all fell apart. This item is over priced and very poor quality.
3,Small Hammer Loop,"The first one I bought lasted 2 years. Used 5 days a week, year around. The stitching between the pockets ripped out first, maybe in 4 weeks. It is a tough apron. The second one I got was not the quality of the first. The hammer loop was too small and the stitching between pockets was gone in 2 weeks. I'm not planning to buy another."
5,Better quality than I expected,I bought this light commercial knob for residential application since the price was reasonable. The quality is better than I expected.
2,The product is good--the price is ridiculous,"I feel kind of foolish that I've been buying this Nori from Amazon for a while now. To be fair, the Edozen Nori brand does taste great and is easy to work with when making sushi rolls. However, I thought $4.99 wasn't bad for a pack of 10 . . . until I discovered this exact same brand, same package for sale at my local Kroger grocery store for $1.99. Yep, I've been paying 2 1/2 times too much for something that was readily available at a grocery store chain. I would check out your local grocery store before buying this product from Amazon and you may get a much better deal."
1,Terrible quality!,"I make sushi often and these are the worst Nori I have ever purchased. They were extremely thin, very crumbly and fell apart at the most gentle touch. After trying to use 2, I threw the remainder in the trash."
2,Eh,"Still sitting in my fridge after a year, Used about one sheet. Just go to your local market or store - don't be lazy like me! not fresh or very tasty at all either..."
1,terrible,This product stinks like seaweed and after tasting it I thought I was eating seaweed right from the ocean. My wife and I had the worst taste in our mouths for hours. On a good note the birds liked it because that's what good for.
1,"Don't Buy, Way Over Priced!",These packets of 10 sheets sell for $1.99 to $2.99 in local grocery stores. When I first ordered this item is stated that there was more than 1 pack of 10 sheets; what I received was one (1) packet of 10 sheets.
4,Viennese nostalgia and melancholy,"These lovely pieces in this CD are transcription of Leopold Godowsky's piano music. They were dedicated to his friends Fritz and Harriet Kreisler. These pieces are Godowsky's remembrance of the Old Vienna. The violin writing shares some similarities with Fritz Kreisler's more demanding short pieces such as ""Caprice Viennois"", and piano writing is equally complex and dense (very typical Godowsky). They may not be profound music, but they surely do not deserve their current neglect. Their mood varies from light and humorous to painfully nostalgic. Being a fan of Kreisler's music, I really enjoyed these pieces. Gottfried Schneider and Cord Garben gives overall fine performances. Schneider's tone is a bit on a lean side, but has certain sweetness that recalls the tone of late Henryk Szeryng. He is outclassed by Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz in the ""Wienerisch."" But who wouldn't! These pieces are treat for someone who loves late-19th century Viennse music."
4,Dorothy is an amazing character,"I didn't realize that this book had been classified under ""inspirational"" until after I'd started it (unabridged audiobook). I'm really glad I gave it a chance; Dorothy is a pretty wild character, and if she's religious ... well ... that's just who she is. She comes off as pretty non-judgmental to me.I do have a request for the author (and her editor): please, please knock off using ""AM"" and ""PM"" for setting the time! Perhaps it isn't so much an issue with the print version, but on tape it got really grating. The reader can infer the time-of-day from other clues."
4,nice inspirational book,"Lovely story about the day to day life in a small town story revolving mainly around retired people (dorothy is 89). great different characters with a wide range of attitudes etc just like in real life. dorothy has loads of spunk and the author gives her a great simple faith - the prayers to God are funny but personally helpful at the same time (should we all do such short prayers with the same faith).Looking forward to reading more in this series, do recommend it for all ages (I am in my 30s) but a lovely gift maybe for an elderly person that lasts longer than chocolates!"
2,Not as expected.,"The author of this was toted to be an upcoming and compared too... what. It is well written, but the plot, action and premises of this is yet to ""get to me"". As to ""..... Are we there yet?"" I still have yet to figure out what it has to do with the story of the book."
2,"If you want a book that is an easy, restful read, then this qualifies......BUT.....","If you want a book that is an easy, restful read, then this qualifies. The characters range from almost angelic to just slightly quirky. The most dramatic scenes involve the heavy-footed driving of Darling Dorothy. And the emotion (to steal part of a quote from Dorothy Parker) runs the gamat ""from A to B."" Still, it is charming enough that you might want to read the rest of the Dorothy books.......but BEWARE! While this first book is $4.99 (and probably should be $1.99 or $2.99), book number two is an astonishng $11.99! (The remainder of the books range from $3.99 to $7.99.)It appears that the author is out to squeeze as much money out of these fluff-like books as possible. I want a quite a bit more than just charm for my $11.99.....and to entice readers with a fairly low price for the first book and then hike the second book up to bestseller price makes me wonder about the ethics of the author."
1,Why was this book published,How did Ms. Baumbich every get this book published. The plot is stupid and the people in the book are boring. This is one of the worst books I have read.
1,Avoid the Reader Site!,"I purchased this item from the Reader Site through Amazon. I had gone to my local bookstore, which has a Spanish section, to see if they had it. They did not, but told me they could order it, and I could have it in a couple weeks. I decided to go through Amazon instead, always having had good experiences in the past. THIS WAS A MISTAKE IN THIS CASE! I was told the item would arrive within a month. When it did not, I wrote to the Readers Site, which said it had been shipped and to give it another day or two. When it still didn't arrive, I was sent a USPS tracking number, which I had to call the USPS with to find out the status(why the Readers Site couldn't do that, I don't know). USPS had no record of the tracking number. I wrote the Readers Site and told them this and that I expected a prompt response. After four or five days, I finally contacted Amazon, who did an investigation, and I was refunded the money."
2,Biography surprisingly bad presentation,"The main thing about the biography is that they accompany Grant's quite sad life story with completely inappropriate cheery rinky-tink piano music, including, believe it or not, ""The Entertainer""! Between this jarring music, the narration, and the music and dialogue from the film clips, you sometimes can't quite hear the narration. Surprisingly bad presentation."
5,great look,comes in handy in large room serves as a night light too like that you can change colors when you want
1,"12"" 2 color neon clock","This clock may look nice....but it is cheap, junk. Thisis made overseas in the Asian market where the labor rateis about $1.75 per day. This is novelty crap, and a wasteof money. I suggest you buy American Made product...something that can be kept for long term, and repaired if necessary.I bought one of these clocks and it lasted for 3 weeks...andnote.... Only the adapter has a UL rating not the actualpower transformer / board."
2,disc had a scratch!!!,disc had a scratch!!! disc had a scratch!!! disc had a scratch!!! how can anybody sell a disc with a scratch?
3,They all fall down,"Although this toy looks like great fun, it is not. Water gets inside and the hippos fall to the side. It is difficult to keep them in the erect position.This toy is okay for outside the bathtub providing joy as the hippos spin and spin, but after the first two times IN the bathtub they don't spin very well."
2,not worth your money,my daughter received this for her 2nd birthday and was not at all interested in it. It didn't stand upright and it just wasn't very much fun!
1,waste of money and time,this was a horrible playgroup purchase. the kids in our playgroup just walked over this in the pool and it wouldn't stay upright.
3,let down,"I hate to say it, but the other reviews are pretty much right. My daughter does like this toy better then the penguin tub toy we got her, but both have been a let down. She doesn't really play with it. The water has to be really high in the tub for the hippos to twirl. We don't fill the tub too high for her because she is only 20 months old and likes to splash too. Not a great toy. I am still looking for a good bath play toy for her."
1,DON'T BUY - It scratched my iPod!!,This case scratched up the back of my iPod really badly because of the slide-on mechanism. Kind of ironic because the whole point of a case is to keep your iPod from getting scratched!!
4,Works!,Works as expected to charge and sync and iPhone 5. The connector is more snug than the Apple version but has been no issue. Seems to be solidly built otherwise.
1,received a bad cable,"Ordered two of these, and one is bad. It does not work at all, no synch nor charge.The working cable does both tasks quite fine, however it's surprising that it works at all. The metal connector coming out of the plastic housing is not perfectly square, it is slightly slanted.The only vendor that is officially licensed to create Lightning cables at this point is Belkin. I wonder if Boxwave is an official licensee. If they are not, I wonder when and if Apple will shut them down."
3,Sync Doesnt Work,"This cord works for charging only on my iPhone 5. If you plug it in with iTunes, it will give you an error. iTunes cannot see the phone using this cord. My Apple sync cord works fine. It also is harder to plugin the lightning connect into the iphone compared to the Apple cord. It takes more force."
2,"Quick read, but not much more than that.","I would say by the end, I did not feel a thing for any of the characters. By the end of the book, none of them seemed to grow that much. I typically enjoy books where I am so engrossed in the story, it's as if I'm in the room with the characters eavesdropping on conversations. Not so here. I was very detached from this book and found myself skimming pages. I felt the attraction to the lawyer, Dalton, was contrived. I initially picked up this book from the library due to the interracial aspects, but it happened so fast and without explanation. SAme goes for the relationship with Lance. We never saw/read them have any deep meaningful conversations until AFTER they had sex and hooked up. It just was all very blah. Janelle was not a heroine in my book."
2,Good in theory,"These look cute, and definitely serve their purpose (i.e. holding an iPod). But they smell weird! I couldn't figure out what exactly the smell was, but it was not pleasant. For that reason alone I probably wouldn't recommend them."
2,They're just too small!,Tried to use these for an iPhone and an old (2G?) iPod and they leave quite a bit of both devices uncovered. For the extra $10 go with Apple's branded version.
4,They are good,"But I did expected (and thought) they were smaller. Besides that ""problem"", it's fine and product quality is nice !"
4,Good price-quality,I use this socks with my ipod touch 4g and they fit perfectly. The price is reasonable and the colores are OK.
5,quick and good,"I got the product in short time and it was exactly as the one in the photo. Very happy with purchse. Using it for ipod, iphone and camera."
2,Not Great,"Well, you get what you pay for.These aren't all that great.The cuff is a bit restrictive and they don't accomodate longer wider devices as I had imagined.The material feels cheap and thin, and the device easily slides out of the sock, making them kinda dangerous when handling your devices.I think I maybe should have just paid the extra money and tried the official Apple brand socks.[...]"
5,Perfect!,"I bought these to sew onto the waistband of all of my teen sons' gym shorts that don't have pockets! They are perfect! They hold their cell phones (the razzle and the alias) I pods, school id's, money or whatever else they need to carry with them. They stretch nicely and I think they are great! I am buying more to have on hand!"
4,Great for most devices,"The socks are just big enough to cover up most devices outside of tall cell phones and iPod Touch/iPhone. I have a Palm Pre that uses the extended life battery so it is a bit chunkier than it is with the default battery, so the phone won't fit in the original pouch. But these socks fit it perfectly! These really work best for flip-phones or smaller-profile devices. And they're insanely cheap compared to the over-priced Apple versions."
3,"Good, but not perfect","At half the price of the Apple/iPod branded version, they sure are an attractive alternative. The color, weave, and stitching look almost identical. The two major differences are 1) the absence of the Apple/iPod tag and 2) the size.They are quite small(thin) out of the box but do stretch suitably. However they are a little shorter than the Apple version. One will hold an 80GB iPod Classic and just about exactly cover it up. However an iPhone sticks out by about 1/2""."
4,Inexpensive alternative to Apple's iPod Socks,"These were a great little find. After a trip to the Apple store [when I had to talk myself out of paying $29 for their product], I came home and searched for generic iPod Socks. Yay for me! I will say, however, that the seam along the side of the sock is a little thick and takes away from the smooth, snug look of it when it's on a device [using mine for my iPhone 3G]. The shopping was a little much, but even with the shipping, these were sill more inexpensive than Apple's product. They didn't come in a 6 pack, but rather 6 individually packaged socks in one shipping package."
3,Cute but too short for Ipod Touch,"These socks are cute and they will fit around ipod or ipod touch (girthwise). They are about 1cm too short to cover the whole ipod touch lengthwise, though. I have stretched it as much as possible and it still comes up short. Good for storing cell phones and smaller ipods such as the Nano."
5,PERFECT & PRICED RIGHT!!,These fit my IPOD TOUCH 4th Generation PERFECTLY. Bright Colors - Great Quality!! Arrived in only 2 days!! AWESOME ONCE AGAIN!!
1,DUD!!!,I did not like this! The intructor is EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!! I did not like this! Do not buy this product!!!
3,Lessons too short,"As the product description says, this DVD is only 43 minutes. I don't think a 43-minute video is worth $10. That being said, it's a good workout."
2,Disappointing,Does not have Kristina showing the dance moves and that was the only reason I bought it.DS
3,A change of pace,"This video is a nice change of pace from the typical exercise videos. It is a good workout, but not a challenge to complete. It is extremely well coached and the steps are not difficult to follow. A nice addition to your exercise video collection."
3,"It's great, but the music is awful!","This workout is great, it's a little hard, but with a little practice it's ok. The only problem with this workout it's the music! It's awful, If I would've known that the music was like this, I wouldn't have bought it, unless you don't mind."
2,Need Dance Experience,"I've always wanted to dance but never have and I thought this would be a great way to break into it. I tried watching the step guide and it was horrible. I found it very difficult to follow along and as soon as I thought I got one step she moved on to the next and it became me just trying to keep up. The step guide is also a pain as she goes through so many that by the time you get done, you have no idea what you learned in the steps before. Also, there is no easy way to find what step you want to work on in the step guide so you can't really use it to work on one certain step. I think this would be great for someone who used to take dance as a kid and wanted to get back into it or something like that but as a beginner I found it difficult and frustrating."
4,Dance off the Inches: Dance It off Ballroom,This DVD is cool. The quality of the DVD is good and the instruction given by instructor is pretty easy to follow. It is really step by step so to speak.
4,Traje,"This book is good for those looking to learn about traditional Maya dress in Guatemala and how it relates to the lives of those who make and wear it. It is an interesting read, giving good insights to cultural aspects also. Although the research was conducted many years ago, this was an interesting and yet very shaky time in Guatemala, making the read all the more interesting."
2,Poorly written for a college level textbook,"I don't know if earlier editions are better, but this one (4th) is definitely poor quality. The writing is absolutely terrible in some places--short, choppy sentences that often don't connect to the rest of the paragraph--and gives the feeling of having been cut-and-pasted. The style feels almost amateurish and is very distracting, making it hard to actually learn the subject being presented. Not at all a good choice as the main textbook for a class."
3,Better alternatives....,"This textbook is a real drag to read even when you are interested in the subject matter. A highlighter is a must because it reads like a novel with very few headings. It isnt in color and has many errors and typos. If it is required, buy it used because it probably wont be a book you want to keep. If you are looking to learn about cognition look towards the neuroscience books LWW and Lange offer."
2,Disappointed,I thought I would receive the new product that I requested; however I instead received a used book with highlighted pages. I also paid for expedited shipping and received a week and a half leter than I paid for. I will not be ordering again!!!
3,Not good enough,"I put this stuff to the test. 600 Sq foot house with horrible horrible odors. Set off 6 the first time. It killed the smell of cigarette smoke, and even killed a rat in the process. However it was unable to peel off the remaining odors like that of meth smoke and what was eventually determined to be water damage in the floor resulting in black mold and the stench of a rat colony set up in the attic adjacent to the central air unit.So While it made a valiant effort it just was not enough to overcome the stench I bought it for. If it were a normal house and not a renovation of an old crack den, it might be alright. The smell is highly wintergreenish and its more tolerable than pleasant. Under less formidable conditions, it might do alright. However if you are to the point that you are buying odor foggers, your situation is dire enough so as this effect which lasts for about 2 days might simply not be enough."
3,Odor control fogger,"I bought this to use in a rental where the tenant had smoked (a lot). After using it the house smelled like a fogger/smoker mix. I think it would help with some things, but it wasn't the miracle I had hoped for. We ended up recarpeting and painting."
