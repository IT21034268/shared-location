4,Great bed!,I bring out this bed for when I have guests over. Hand pumping isn't the best method but doesn't take very long to inflate. The pillows are a major disappointment...I don't even know why the pillows are included.
1,Rating,"If I could I would give this item less than one star. Do not buy! It is extremely hard to inflat. In addition, it is very hard to insert the pump into the air outet."
1,Leak after 2 uses. Piece of junk,"I bought this for indoor use when having guests over as I dont have a spare room. Well, it was a complete waste of money. After the second use, there was a slow leak like everyone else complained about. After 4 hours after, filling up, my butt was on the ground. DO NOT BUY. Hopefully amazon will let me exchange it for another brand."
4,Good Product,"Excellent product. Fast shipping. Very professional, pleased with this product. My only problems was the outside box was banged up and that's not something you want to see from a product that is fragile. The bed works just fine and so does the pump. I would buy from this supplier again."
5,Extremely Hardy,"I am heavily involved in couchsurfing, and over the last two months, I've had ten surfers use it. We've kept it blown up, and are just now needing to add air. Honestly, I am amazed at how well it is doing, especially for the price, and I would highly recommend buying it if you are on the fence. Great product."
1,Didn't last a single night...,"This bed was comfortable enough (at first) and easy to inflate/deflate. However, it didn't even last a single night before springing a leak and becoming unusable. It required refilling because I was hitting the floor at least twice a night.Completely useless. Really a shame I couldn't get a refund on this product."
2,Lasted 6 months,"We purchased this air mattress for a camping trip in June. We used it for three days in a tent on a lawn. In the next six months, we only used this air mattress in the house and for a total of 10 nights. So, all told, we slept on this air mattress for less than 14 days. Yesterday, we found small holes across the bottom of the air mattress that were releasing the air. It will no longer stay inflated. When we used this mattress, we were satisfied with it - fairly comfortable, straight forward to fill, etc. It was well priced and shipped in a timely manner. However, an air mattress should last longer than 6 months/14 days of use. The return policy is expired, and the mattress will need to be replaced. :("
1,don't do it,when inflated the airbed was not the dimensions stated on the box. it does nto hold air all that well. needs to be reinflated about once a week.
2,"Started to leak, spend more money to get a better one","I replaced this one shortly after buying it. I purchased a queen that is supposedly ""Never going to leak."" I've had it for over a year and it is awesome. Inflates itself. Don't buy this one. Spend $20+ on a better one made of stronger material."
3,Airbed,"The airbed is good for the price - the hand pump is useless for this size bed(takes too long even to pump the air pillows), you will have to purchase an electric air pump."
2,Doesn't hold up very long,"I bought this as a replacement mattress for my mom when her old air mattress had a leak. She really enjoyed this mattress and said it was very comfortable. It took a little while to pump it up though and was a little difficult and did not come with any instructions, but she figured it out. Unfortunately after a week of use, there is now a hole where the pump plugs in and it can not be fixed with the patch. This may be nice for short use, but it won't last long."
1,Tina,"There is a big air leaking problem of this product. Even we followed the right way to fill in air for a couple of times, still not working. My back was hurting in the morning after waking up. Do not buy!!"
1,Don't get this one,"This bed stopped holding air after about 5 nights of use by one person. The pump is a small hand pump that takes 15-20 minutes to inflate the bed and leaks air when using it. The pump is annoying and tiring as you can only use your arms, it is not made to stand on it to pump. We threw out the useless air pillows that leaked on the first night. I would not recommend it nor would I buy it again."
3,Good enough!,"I used it camping! It fit in the tent and filled up real easy, it was nice it came with pillows but after 3 days, it was deflating and I didn't want to take it out of the tent, bring it to the car to fill up and put in back in the tent but it worked good enough!!"
3,pump takes forever,"This bed takes about 20 min to blow up which is a pain, but what do you expect for the low price. It is just as comfortable as a more expensive air mattress."
1,It simply doesn't work.,"I had family coming into town to stay, and needed an air mattress in a hurry, so I ordered this. I made the mistake of waiting to try it till the last minute, and immediately regretted ordering it. The pump comes with 3 nozzles, none of which attaches securely to the valve on the bed. There are no directions for inflating it, which shouldn't be an issue for such a simple mechanism, but using the largest nozzle (which the box shows as the appropriate one to use to inflate the bed) no air makes it into the mattress at all; there is just a high pitched whistling noise. The second largest nozzle doesn't stay in the valve. The smallest nozzle causes the bed to inflate very slowly and with enormous amounts of effort, but only till the bed is about 90% inflated, at which point it will inflate no further.My guest is lying on a limpid air mattress and I am sorely regretting my purchase."
1,rediculous,The bed came with nothing it said..it was missing the air pump and the pillows ....and all the connecters soNow when I blow it up it doesn't hold the air...
1,Went flat.,I ordered this item and then requested a replacement when it went flat. The replacement also went flat. I was quickly reimbursed and the product was removed from the site while being investigated for the flaw.
3,An okay product,"Bed deflates a little over night, more than I would expect. Don't use it that often so the price was good for what it is."
1,Disappointment with airbed,"Have to toss out. Disappointment much! I purchased the bed for when my 16-yr-old nephew sleeps over once per month at the weekend. After use about six times, there is a slow leak (we can't determine source). He goes to bed with a firm bed but in the morning the bed is flat, unfortunately. I really thought we would've gotten more use, given the excellent product reviews. Needless to say, we are very disappointed. Pity the bed wasn't like the pillows because those have been absolutely no problem. Ah, well."
4,Good price - nice size,"Did not have any problems yet. Cannot share the problems (like losing all its air over night or the air pump doesn't fit the nozzle etc.) people had so far. Sure it loses a little bit of air after 2 or three days, but with the air pump (that is included in the delivery) it's not a big deal to refill it."
3,Not Bad!,"IIntex Classic Downy Queen Airbed with 2 Pillows and Double Quick Hand PumpSo far, so good. Some air did leak out the first night but we tightened the screw and it seems to be holding in the air. For the money, I think it's pretty good."
5,Totally worth it's money,"Been using it for a month now - no problems, very comfortable (I sleep on it every day). Smelled with rubber when I unpacked it, but the smell vanished in a few days. Inflates in about 5-10 minutes with the supplied hand pump. Needed to pump some additional air only once since I bought it. Haven't tried the pillows."
4,Great airbed!,Great airbed! I love this airbed mostly because it is so firm once it is fully pumped up. It has a GREAT price-value ratio!
3,Dissapointing,"After a good (but incredibly short) effort with their first album, the River City Rebels fall flat on their face with this album. It's not terrible, as songs like What's in a Dream, On the Train, and Small Town Pride are quite good, but the album lacks all sort of direction but in lyrics and in music. Are there still horns in this band? They sure do not appear much. Do these guys love their small town, or were their parents abusive bastards? The music just doesn't seem honest it seems more as if they are writing to fulfill punk rock stereotypes of drinking, bastard parents, etc. There is an attempt at growth, but it just doesn't show through.The album is worth it for the good tracks mentioned, but be warned it is a step down."
1,Bogus,"Great music, but indeed available elsewhere in a legitimate package with good liner notes: the Chicago Concerts (1946); thanks to the previous reviewer. I checked track by track and found that every last one of the pieces was in fact taken from the the first CD of the Chicago Concerts. ""Golden Feather"" and ""Blue Skys"" are rightly labelled (although J-Bird can't spell); all the rest are scrambled. This disc contains part, not all, of the mislabelled Deep South Suite. It contains, mislabelled ""Hiawatha"", ""Things ain't what they used to be"". There is no Ellington composition to my knowledge titled ""Things ain't what they seem to be"". Certainly this disc ain't what it seems to be. I'll be cautious about anything J-Bird sells in the future."
3,"Mixed feelings, some basic design flaws",When it (works most of the time) it has a very good picture. However there have been many times that it was frustrating when the set malfunctions to have to unplug the set for ten seconds or more then plug it back in to get it reset. I have some backround in machine design; It seems that the microcontroller can get into an undefined state and there is no watchdog circuit built in to get the set back into operation without user intervention. Sharp's recommended service shop and factory technical support failed to address this problem.
1,More sound problems,Another case of the sound board giving out after 18 months. Any company with a conscience would assume warranty responsibility for an obvious engineering issue.Not at all impressed.
3,Gothic tenderness embodied,"This sequel is nothing like its counterpart, Dan Yack. The first book was a tale of the youthful exuberance of our hero Dan Yack. This is a tender tale of the women in his life. His penchant for brash action slips through at times, but The Confessions of Dan Yack is a love story. It is undoubtedly written by Blaise Cendrars and therefore not an ordinary Hollywood tale of passion, though Hollywood is involved. Mireille is his Aurelia, the young daughter of one of his mistresses who he adores and marries. He lives for her, producing movies to give her acting parts, primarily as a gothic beauty. These are his confessions, spoken into a dictaphone long after his Mireille was struck down with an illness. They are at times disturbing, beautiful, and heartfelt. This is not the book one would expect after the first debaucherous tale, but it needed to be told, and it needs to be read."
3,no java transition explained,"The title caught my eye, thinking that this could be a book for an experienced java developer that wishes to transition to .NET development. Since the Java and .NET platforms are very similar, instead of having to thumb through one of those 1000-page tomes for beginners to extract the essence, and finding that, ""ah, that's how this java thing I know so well is done equivalently in .NET"", thus saving alot of time trying to filter out the obvious, well, this book comes short.It is, after all, a beginner's book for C#. No java experience required. Too bad. (but it was interesting nonetheless...) Just that the title was misleading."
2,Medium bird toy,"I bought this toy for my parakeets. It was so big the birds were very scared. It is boxed now, waiting for a bigger bird I can give it too."
5,Lots of textures to appeal to the bird and keep him entertained,"My birds love cooked corn as a treat, and the corn stalk on the toy entices them to play. There are lots of textures to appeal to the bird and keep him entertained."
4,Boss Retractable Dog Leads,"These leads are very well made and very inexpensive, I had to buy three so because of that I didn't have to break the bank. Thanks so much for the quick service!"
4,Very helpful guide,"It's hard to find a decent book with patterns and meaurements for paper theatres, so it's a great thing to have this book - a great variety of models and kinds of theatres to build, advice for the beginner, and additional information about types of media. One thing that annoyed me was that some of the patterns didn't supply a few basic dimensions, and I had to guess - very risky with an art so precise. It also does a poor job of explaining what this fold or that cut is actually going to do for the theatre. Confusing stuff.However, my first theatre was a success and looks lovely, and I'm in the process of making another one with doubled dimensions!Great book!"
4,"Good, but could be better","The book is good, and the section of consciousness is very insightful. However, towards the end, the book becomes sort of redundant. He is driving home the same ideas over and over again. And even though he gives a good idea of what consciousness, divine human transformation, and society's benefits from such things are, in my opinion he could have gone into more detail about how to achieve consciousness and divine human transformation."
5,Lo lei por curiosidad,"sin que ninguna desgracia hubiera herido mi vida..Y LO ENCONTRE MARAVILLOSO !Nadie esta libre de una pena, pero estoy convencida de que este libro tiene la capacidad para levantarnos de casi cualquier tropiezo !TENLO EN TU CASA igual que tienes aspirinas...¡NO SABES CUANDO OUEDES NECESITARLO Y HASTA TE PUEDE SALVAR LA VIDA!"
5,very clear explanation of otherwise hard to grip concepts.,"Materials covered in certain chapters are equivalent to a one semester class at MIT.. though in less detail, the lucid explanation of the fundamental concepts are impressive.. this book is a very good start for someone who has never touched the subject of Parallel Computing before."
4,Hinda is one to remember,"Catch her first on the great UK movie called ""G:MT"", her voice makes you replay the video just for the tunes. The CD is highly reminiscent of Randy Crawford, very soulful. Good variation and only a couple of tracks you may want to skip. Enjoy!"
3,"The San Francisco Opera, 1922-1978","Arthur Bloomfield's book is the only purely narrative history of the San Francisco Opera. It was published in 3 editions, of which this last takes the story to 1978. For those with an interest in the opera company and San Francisco operatic history, it is pretty much indispensable. However, I find the coverage of the early years, where Bloomfield is a reporter, documenting history and the opinions of others, to be far better than his discussion of the later years. During the 1960s and 1970s, he relies on his own judgements which are, I find, highly dubious given our knowledge of the singers involved.Nonetheless, there is no other comparable work, and surely it is a decent effort, well worth owning."
5,My class loves it!,This book was given to me as a gift last year when I began teaching early childhood. My kids LOVE it! It is the most requested book in our library. The kids love to get out the musical instruments and shake along with the music. Every preschool class should have a copy of this book.
1,Poor quality,"I bought this book as a baby shower ""card"" for a friend who has a rock n roll band. I thought it would a sweet way to get his daughter started young :) However, I did not give the book to them because it came with sticky pages and the CD was not included. Pretty disappointed and didn't bother looking for another copy."
2,Babies Gone Wild,"From the same author asI Stink!,I'm Dirty!, and many others, although in this case her husband Jim did not do the illustrations.I love children's books (especially the two mentioned above) but I truly loathe this one. Sorry.My kids *do* enjoy seeing the babies doing inappropriate things like ransacking the kitchen or going outside to play by themselves. There are NO parents or teachers present in any of the illustrations, just ten babies on their own. It's a daycare nightmare!The book does teach (very) basic rhymes and is probably good in principle to encourage interest in musical instruments. It also came with a free CD (with music by folk singers Peggo & Paul) though I disliked the song, possibly even more."
3,Adorable but junky,"This ducky is the cutest thing my family ever saw. My grandma had a stoke and is recovering in the hospital. We took it over to her and she smiled. The whole staff got together in her room, they loved it. After one of the children played with it independently it broke. I advise this be bought only for adults."
1,Short circuit Duck,"I was so excited to get this duck, and when I finally got it I was dissapointed. The company cheapstuff is who I ordered it from, and they didn't exchange my defective duck. I didn't receive the return policy for the duck, or see it on line. When I contacted the seller, I had a hard time getting them to keep in contact with me. When they did finally respond, they wouldn't return the defective duck, and left me a nasty email about why they wouldn't help me. I will not buy from theseller again."
4,Great Fun for Kids,"I purchased Willie the Jumping Duck for my 5 year old granddaughter and for a friend's 4 year old granddaughter. Both girls loved the toy!! About the only educational value would be to learn the words of the song Willie sings. It is purely, in my opinion, a toy for amusement as it sings and jumps up and down. And the girls were very amused!"
5,"Festive fun for the whole family, if you all love cartoons.","At the age of 34, I'm still a sucker for those Bugs-Bunny like cartoons, packed with wit clearly aimed at the adults watching with the children. Most of this tape is just plain funny (a version of the night before Christmas includes all the Animaniacs characters), and includes great music, but there is a kicker of a holiday lesson, wonderfully told, in ""A Gift of Gold"". Do not buy this tape if you think belching is unacceptable. The real judge? My nephews John and Isaac, who loved it."
5,love it,There are only two types of people. Those who like Animaniacs and those who don't like Animaniacs. Which one are you?
5,Tired of Cheap toasters?,"If you are, buy this one. It is made with quality. Never gets hot on the outside(except top). Heavy duty cord that you can rap up. Toasts bread perfectly."
1,"Do not buy this toaster, do not buy Kitchen Aid","Beware - this toaster is a lemon. Just over three months from purchase, the bagel lock / warm buttons stopped working soon followed by the lever that would not lock. So not only could we not use for bagels we could not use for any types of bread. This is going in the trash. Definitely consider another model and another manufacturer. Kitchen Aid has lost an advocate here."
1,"Not Kitchenaid Quality, Big isses","Have had this toaster for about 18 months, so now outside the 1 year warranty. Have experienced the unequal toasting issues mentioned by others, plus the plastic handle broke off, and now the toaster won't lock down any longer. So toaster is useless. We don't overuse this appliance and keep it very clean. There is no reason why we should have these problems so early in the lifecycle. My call to the customer service (number on the bottom of the toaster) resulted in offering a 30% discount on a new toaster (which is the same sale that Macy's has down the street except Kaid would add shipping charges!). I saw good ratings on this toaster (and I enjoyed it while it worked), so I wonder if I just got a lemon or the higher ratings I've seen came from buyers who haven't had it all that long. I expected a Kitchenaid toaster to last longer than 18 montsh. More so, I expected Kitchenaid to stand behind a product better with their name on it. Very disappointed, buyer beware."
4,Works really well,"works really well but, the stainless steel kinda sucks bc you can never rally manage to keep the fingerprints off of it."
1,very little of value in this book,"As is his style, Zeke Feinberg is boring, repetitive, and self worshipping. I did appreciate some information on setting the dice. But if the contents were organized and didn't repeat itself, the book could be a 12 page pamphlet worth $3.00. This book repeats much of another of Zeke's poor efforts, How to make $12 to $24 per hour"
5,Dissolving Barrier to Success,"When I thought about writing a review for the DISSOLVING BARRIERS TO SUCCESS DVD I thought 'no way' could I ever put it all in one paragraph. I got so much out of it that that would be an impossible task. Suffice it to say I drove 7 hours to take a live workshop after using this DVD 6 or 7 times at home. That should tell you everything you need to know about whether or not you should buy Mark Fourman's videos. I say buy them....all...and get thee to a live workshop if you can. As a workshop leader myself I can honestly say nothing was left out of the video and everything you need to explore your barriers to success in any arena is present on this powerfully packed, and very insightful video. I will continue to use it for some time to come. My clients and I love it. And let's all prompt Mark to make more...soon!!!!!! Way to go Mark...you've got a winning presentation!"
2,Very mediocre novel...,"""Home movie"" by Ellen Akins, tries to be a good ""different"" novel about coming of age. Instead, it has almost no plot(supposedly, the girl Joey learns from Giffard, the piano teacher, and tries to discover who this mysterious actor in the home movies is), and the characters are boring. Joey is OK, but she isn't memorable expect for being in the middle of a parental squabble that has her christened as ""Joseph"". The stripper, Daisy, is also not exciting, and flat. The wandering mother and Giffard come across as unpleasant users. Just avoid this book."
4,colander,"i like the size of this colander - it is larger than what i had anticipated, i can get alot of fruits and vegetables in it at one time."
1,Metal & Wood Baker's Rack,"Product was defective,had to re-adjust part of it so it would fit together. I was left with 5 screws not sure were they're suppose to go? There were no holes left to put them anyway. The color was black/black not as it appears in the picture on amazon. The company only wants to give me 10% back of my money back because I fixed there defective product. Amazon will have to arbitrate this one!"
5,Big Book of Knowledge,"One of the best books that informs children of scientific discoveries and is easy to read and includes wonderful pictures! I would suggest this book as a reference book in any classroom and is a must have for teachers! I have several books that teach children about knowledge, but have to say that I think that this one tops them all!"
1,a horrible book,This was the worst book I have ever read. It was about a Chinese girl who had problems with her family. Half the time you didn't even know who the characters were. What made the book worse was it was all ... poems. ...
4,Dr. Smoothie Bio Bars,"I've been purchasing this product for several years after my mom discovered them at a local nutrition store. I am allergic to soy and wheat, so my choices in protein bars are very limited. I also prefer raw and organic foods to processed.These bars are a good source of protein without soy, wheat, or gluten which I am deeply grateful for. As far as protein bars go, they are healthier than most I've found with many organic ingredients.I've given Dr. Smoothie 4 out of 5 stars because in my humble opinion, the sugar content is a bit excessive - 9gms for a 2 oz bar. It also includes maltodextrin which is a highly processed food additive derived from corn. And, it contains natural vanilla and carmel flavors, which are not natural foods.I would love to see Dr. Smoothie clean up the bars a bit more to make them raw and organic with less sugar. However, even with these ingredients, they are by far a better bar."
5,"IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS CD PLAYER, YOU'RE A MORON!","Ok, this CD player is great, it's soo cute, and you'll fall in love with it as soon as you put a cd in it. You should buy this CD player if you love listening to music more than anything. I love this CD player, but I wished mine worked better. Mine dosn't work so well because I'm a clumsy teen, and either me or one of my friends are dropping it all the time. But it's still great, I want to buy another one."
2,Noisy on am,"This adapter was noisy on am stations when used with the sony radio.Found a generic at Radio Shack , however, that worked just fine and was quiet for about the same price."
5,Suits me fine...,"I purchased this adapter to be able to use mySony DEJ017CK Walkman Portable CD Player w/ Car Accessorieswhile at work. I have been listening to it daily since my purchase in October of 2011 and have had none of the problems that other reviewers are having. I am perfectly happy with the product; for as much as I listen to my music, I would be willing to bet it has already paid for itself because I have never had a battery in my player.Update 7/9/2012: Still working great!"
1,"Works fine for Discman, but product deteriorates quickly","I purchased this adapter to save on batteries with my Sony Discman, and the product worked great for about 15 months. A few weeks ago, I was using the adapter and noticed a spark. The insulation on the cord had deteriorated and nearly started a fire. The texture of a 7-inch section of the cord looks like the coating had melted. The adapter was never put to unusual use. It was plugged in by my desk and was never misused or abused by anyone. I called Sony to complain and they offered me free shipping if I purchased a replacement. I declined. I have never had a cord that went bad in just a little over a year, and am very disgusted with the product."
5,Great Product,"This product does just what it says it will do. I use it to copy stuff from tape recorder into computer and save on battery power. Shipping was a little pricey (which boosted the overall price), but product could not be found locally, so that's okay."
4,It Does What it is Supposed to Do,"It hasn't shorted out or stopped working, so I like it just fine. It does what it is supposed to do. :)"
1,I didn't get the product I ordered. I have sent them e-mails and have recieved no replies,"I have a Sony Walkman CD player/radio combination D-NF430. I ordered the AC power adaptor for this and they sent me Sony AC-E45A Worldwide AC Power Adaptor with Folding Plug Blade. The male tip is too large to fit into the female AC power port on the walkman. I asked if they had an adapter but got no reply.Thank You,George R. Ramsey239-418-1671"
1,Not for Israel,I was going to buy this to power a Sony SW radio I have as I try to spend a month in Israel every year. The Sony weighs a bit and I would have been very sorry to take an adapter with me that did not work. Thanks for the advice.
3,Not for use with Sony GX221 Walkman,"Three stars is deceptive because it really is a nice adapter, nice size. BUT, it does not go with the Sony GX221 Walkman I purchased from Amazon and I think people need to know that. It is listed on all the pages with the Walkman as a compatable adapter however the plug is too large for the receptical on the Walkman."
1,STATIC PRODUCER,"The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.Invest in batteries rather than this product."
2,This adapter NOT compatible with Sony ICF-M410V Portable FM/AM/TV/Weather Radio,"SUMMARY: Adaptor could create interference if used with AM radios; acceptable for CD, MP3, or other non-radio applications. The 2-Star rating applies to use with radios only (not recommended)EVALUATION:The AC adaptor is typically presented as a ""better together"" purchase recommendation for Sony's ICF-M410V Portable FM/AM/TV/Weather Radio. However, information on the adaptor's package specifically states that the adaptor is NOT recommended for use with radios due to potential interference. The (unstated) reason for this is that the power supply in the adaptor is a switching supply which creates interference, particularly for AM signals.The adaptor should work with CD or MP3 players without any problems, as this is the intended application.NOTE: I am basing this recommendation on the information Sony provides on the package. I have NOT tried it (I returned the adaptor unopened to Amazon for refund)."
1,Grundig Radio Warning,Warning: I was about to buy this AC adapter for my grundig G-2000A radio. I thought I would check eBay first. The one listing on eBay had a better picture and it was clear from the diagram printed on the unit that the polarity is reversed. This will not work with my radio and Amazon says it will.
4,It's fine.,"I worred about It before whether it is fit for my CD, but it works well for my SONY D-NE240."
1,Power Adapter,Ordered the power adapter advertised for our Sony radio/cd/cassette player. Didn't fit. Asked for info on how to get the right one - haven't heard anything. They were very prompt at processing the return.
5,original,great fast service. my only chance at an original replacement and unlike an universal charger dont have to worry about someone changing settings
4,It brings the power,A must have for those that listen to a CD while at work. Got tired of buying batteries for my CD.
2,Doesn't work for long,"I purchased this for my sony CD player. After just a couple of months use, it has a short. Everytime I plug it into my CD player, and then make any kind of movement with the player (like moving it from one side of the table to another), it goes out. Annoyed I couldnt return it b/c I no longer had the receipt."
2,Do not use with AM radio,"The wrapping for this adaptor states that it is not for use with a radio, since it will cause interference. That is so. Amazon should not recommend this for use with the Sony partable radio. But it is OK for FM and TV audio."
1,Wrong application - not suited for use with radios!!!!,"Even though this AC Power Adaptor was listed on the Amazon website as an accessory for a Sony portable transistor radio, the instructions with the radio and the Power Adaptor both clearly state that it is not suited for use with a radio, because it will cause the radio to HUM!!!! Sure enough it is totally unusable with a radio because of the HUM!!! The only AC Power Adaptor to be used with a Sony portable radio is a Sony Model AC-E45HG, which is unavailable through Amazon or anywhere else that I can find!!!"
1,What the description here does not tell you!,"This adapter is NOT for use with a radio! I live in a fairly strong signal area, and the noise from this adapter totally wipes out AM 800 (a 50kw station!), which is what I listen to most often!!"
4,Perfect Music Set for a 10-12 month old,"This will be a go to gift for our friends with kids at or about one year old. All five pieces are great, sound interesting and are durable. The sound of the xylophone is really nice, far superior to anything else we heard in a child's xylophone. The wave drum was a surprise for us, we thought it would be ignored but he loves it just as much as the rest."
4,Nice Sound,Sturdy products make with safe materials. Our grandson loves these instruments. He carries them around shaking them. He is just a year old and not quite ready for the mallet that came with the xylophone as he wants to walk around with it.
4,"Great value for a music set, but no mallet for the drum","I ordered this for a one year old's birthday present. Overall I'm really pleased with the set and it was a great value compared to buying the wave drum and glockenspiel alone. However, I was disappointed to find out there is no mallet for the drum included in the set. It's not pictured now that I look closely, but the other drums are sold with one so I was expecting it. I'm having a hard time finding a drum mallet on Amazon to use with this drum that doesn't look like it could be a choking hazard. I'd still recommend the item but know what is included in the box."
1,Cheap,The items were cheaply made and not worth the price. They are more for an infant than a toddler. I would not recomend this.
5,Four-yr Old Granddaughter Delights In This Toy,"Fourth Birthday gift for brilliant granddaughter--as suggested by her mom, ""She needs some musical instruments."" I checked the fabulous reviews offered at Amazon and chose this set. Happily, I got to watch not only the opening of the gift, but the next few days of play. Abbey chose to use the toys frequently, seemed to thrill to giving concerts, especially when her parents and grandparents all joined in with the other instruments. The xylophone gives the child an opportunity to make tunes; the other pieces, to sense out her rhythmic interests. I couldn't be more pleased--and that's saying a lot when it comes to my demands while making a grandtreasure happy. Oh, yes, the percussion pieces also make fine accompaniment for the dance moves we encourage the children to make."
5,Love it,My 6 mo old has so much fun with it already. He is getting the pieces with smaller parts only under supervision but I honestly don't see how anything could come off - it's very sturdy.Xylophone is nicely in tune but very high pitch overall...
5,FUN!,I bought this for my 1 year old grand daughter and she and I both enjoy making music together! This is so fun and yet can hold up even when tossed on the ground. I am so glad I chose this set!
4,Fun,"The only reason I took away a star is because there are no sticks for the drum. Yes, you can bang it with your hands, but my daughter loves the louder, clearer sound you get when you use a wooden spoon or something to bang with. So far, everything seems pretty durable."
3,Not bad,I cant say that I was crazy about these. To me the quality was not what I expected but for the price they are ok.
2,Not too good or not too bad,"The ball price was cheap but elasticity was not good, only can use it to play for beginer."
4,Two words: beer pong.,"So I don't play ping pong, or beer pong. I just work in a convience store. We go through gross every couple weeks because of the popularity of Beer Pong.After you've had a few beers, any amount of innacuracy the balls might give is going to be unnoticable.If you play beer pong alot, just do yourself the favor, pay $.13 a pieces for a gross, they'll last you a while. And then you don't have to shamble drunk in to a convience store at 3 AM asking for more ;)"
1,BUY THIS TOY,"FOR THOSE YOU HATE MOST!This toy a textbook case of a great idea followed by an AWEFUL design. This toy was WAAAAAAY over-engineered. Not only does it only even remotely work with one of my 15 or so Hot Wheels cars, you're constantly 'fixing' it as the cars drive along and you never actually get in one good run.The slime.. THE SLIME!!! Good GOD, what were they thinking???????Once the slime dumps (takes about 3 seconds) you spend at least 20 minutes cleaning it up for either another run or, in my case, to throw it all away.The only redeeming factor in this toy is it's surprisingly simple to assemble even though its got like 27 parts. It went togetherin about 10 minutes which, by the way, is longer than the fun actually lasts with this toy.Good luck if you've already bought it!"
3,"pricey and gross, but fun for boys","i've read the other reviews, and yes, i have to agree that this toy is overpriced. however, i was able to assemble the toy in about a half an hour and it has stayed together for the most part. i do agree that it is hard to find cars that go all the way up the mountain or fit through all the parts. HOWEVER, my sons (3 and 6) LOVED this toy and have played with it for almost two days straight. the slime is messy, but a hit with the kids. it will stain, so make sure you put the track on top of an old tablecloth or something. overall i think the toy is overpriced and the quality is not superior, but my kids are having fun with it."
1,This is the worst toy I have ever purchased.,"This toy is so badly designed that it has never worked. My son is so excited to get it for Christmas, but I'm going to convince him to get something else and take this piece of junk back to where it came from. If all of Santa's toys were this bad all kids would want to burn him at the stake."
1,"Slimecano, not worth it!","I recently purchased the slimecano for my son, none of the hot wheels cars worked in it, even the recommended one's (I called the Hot Wheels customer relations number to complain and they told me that only certain cars are recommended). I thought if you pay over $40.00 for something that they should at least provide a car to use with it. My son liked that it was a volcano but became frustrated every time he pressed the launcher it got stuck and then the car would get stuck in the back of the volcano. Needless to say I called Hot Wheels Customer relations again and returned it, they gave me a $56.00 voucher to buy something else. I couldn't take it back to a store because I used the slime. For all of you out there who purchased this toy do not throw it away, call Customer Relations and they will do something for you, if enough people call maybe they will take it off the market."
1,Slimecano=JUNK!!!!!!!,This #$%!@#!!! thing fell apart the moment I got! Way overpriced!!! I would have givin this piece o crap a black hole but that was not an option. The only reason I gave it 5 stars for durability was that the stupid thing wouldn't bend to a chain saw!! Parents and giftgivers this is a definite DON'T BUY OR ELSE YOU'LL BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Where do you get more slime???,"My son loves this toy and we have had little to no trouble with it except for the fact that you can not purchase more slime in the stores. The slime does not last and yes we clean it up after each use, never leave it our and even ziplock it but it still disappears before our eyes! Anyways if it was easy to purchase more then I would give this toy 4 stars because my 5 year old loves it."
3,"Not bad, but messy","What can you expect from a ""slime"" toy? It is gooey and messy. The cars zip around the slime, but it takes a few minutes to get the slime set up. Closing the ""head"" of the monster, which holds the slime, can be a real trick! It takes up a lot of space both while in play and in storage. Overall, a hit with the kids, but loses interest after a few plays and too much clean up to use the slime everytime you play."
1,looks cool but in reality a nightmare,"We got this for our five year old son. It took over an hour to put the thing together, mainly due to its cheap construction. The slime dries too fast and is difficult to clean off the many parts. The cars are difficult to launch and require too much redirection to get them to go anywhere or do anything. The noises are neat but save yourself $45 and just get a plastic thing of goo from somewhere. That's what the kids really find fun. And this goo stains! I'm really disappointed that hot wheels would put out a piece of a junk like this and have the nerve to charge what they do for it. Yep, it's going back to TRU tomorrow!"
1,The worst toy I have ever purchased!!!!!!!!,"This is by far the worst toy I have ever purchased. This toy after a lengthy assembly has never one time functioned properly. It is VERY flimsy and constantly falls apart or falls over because it is not structurally sound.Do not waste your money on this toy!!I will never, ever buy another Hot Wheels toy!!!!"
1,"Flimsy, cheap, messy","Hard to assemble, messy slime stains everything including hands and clothes. Flimsy track stops cars travel. Slime has to be removed after playing as it will dry out. Another cheaply made Hot Wheels toy. Buyer beware. Try the Speedstars tracks They are awesome!"
1,I've been slimed!,"Mattel should fire the toy designer that came up with this one. It's a $40 one-shot deal. About 30 minutes to assemble, and you get one good slime run. I gave 2 stars for ""fun"" because it is kind of cool how the slime cascades down the mountain...and then onto the floor or table...put down newspapers! None of our cars could make the long steep slingshot up the volcano thing.Then the instructions say you're supposed to hand wash all the pieces? After I spent 30 minutes getting it together there was no way I was going to disassemble, wash and rebuild this thing each time. It will go in the trash and I'd like to say it will be the last Hot Wheels set we own, but never underestimate the power of advertising to influence children into wanting horrible products."
1,peice of crap,my five year old begged for this toy and i resisted until two days before christmas and gave in because he kept telling everyone it was the only thing he wanted. It is poorly made and keeps falling apart. The cars have to be pushed along the track and do not go automatically on their own. The slime is sticky and what do you do with it after. He got two minutes of enjoyment and now it will go in the back of the closet never to be played with again.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!! - BUYER BEWARE,"I agree with most of the reviews here. My son wanted this toy more than anything else for Christmas. Needless to say, I wish we never bought it for him. It took about 1 hour to put together and the head does not stay together and we have only a little slime left. The worst part is the slime, they don't tell you how much damage it can do. How can Hot Wheels sell a toxic slime like this that does not clean up easily. I am very diligent about cleaning up the slime after he plays with it, and even put a mat underneath, but some still go on my hardwood floors and I had trouble getting it off.The worst part, which I will be contacting Mattel about, is that somehow some of the slime got on my oriental rug and it will not come out. I have tried just about everything. [...]. I think not!!!! This is by far, the worst toy Mattel has ever put out and I will never buy another toy from them again."
1,Do not buy at ANY cost,"This is a classic example of false advertising to the max. Does nothing what it says, The kids were bored with it after 5 minutes of fighting with the cars pusing it through the tracts. If I payed $5 at a yard sale for this, I would want to return it.Its a shame that the Mattel company would produce this and push it on our children."
1,can you say class action ?,"kidding aside. probably the worst toy ever sold. you might as well spend $40 on a box that says ""got ya sucker"" when you open it. It really doesn't even work...at all. I don't think they really ever intended it to work...seriously. Next year I'm buying the kids an old fashioned wooden plane. The worst part of this reveiw is that I had to at least give it 1 star."
1,best toy i ever purchased!!!,"what a great toy......only took me 5 minutes to assemble. works great......i drank the lava and ended my misery......now i'm in the psycho ward ""relaxing"".......no toy assembly to worry about here. happy new year!!"
1,"Junk, don't buy. All HotWheel playsets are junk.","Junk. Really, enough said. I, nor my children, ever had a good experience with HotWheel playsets. The MatchBox playsets are much more durable and usable.This toy was opened, put together in what seemed like 2 hours, and then NEVER operated correctly. No cars seem to work right (couldn't they at least put a car in the set that would work with it), the thing just falls apart while looking at it. A TOTAL waste of money, not worth even $5.00."
1,Not worth it,I purchased this item for my child's birthday. After my brother-in-law who is in the military spent over an hour putting it together we took it outside to try the lava. Thank God we took it outside. The lava got all over everything including the kids. The pieces came apart. It was such a mess we couldn't even put it back together again. This is a huge waste of time as well as money!!
1,J-U-N-K!,"My 8 year old spent 2 hours putting this toy together and it didn't work. When I came home from work (I'm an aircraft mechanic), I verified correct assembly by going through the instructions step by step. The launcher failed to propel the car up the hill because the spring in the launcher is too weak. Track connections are so poor that even if the car did make it up the hill it's doubtful that it could make it all the way through the course without catching on the joints. (...)"
1,Falls Apart without much play time.....,"Boy, the mattel engineers really spent no time creating a toy that would with stand even a minute of playtime. This toys parts fall apart if you sneeze. My boy loves the concept and the slime but the plastic pieces would not stay together for even one minute after assembly. Mattel should refund all parents on this one."
1,Hate this toy!! AVOID SLIMCANO,"Every year I say I am not buying any hotwheels items, even though my son always askes for them. First it was The Fireball, it sucked, then Octoblast, it sucked, last year we got TRex which was slightly better, and then this year the worst- SLIMCANO. This toy falls apart as soon as you touch it,I put the whole thing together and my son starts to play with it and it starts falling apart, the ""slim"" is SOOOOOO messy,it ended up all over my carpet and house. As another reviewer wrote you have to clean this up every time you use it, what a pain!(By the way we did not put it away the last time we played with it, and the slim is all dried up) I love Matchbox products, this year we got The Rocket Park and it is a great toy, sturdy, durable, and hardly any assembly. DO NOT BUY SLIMCANO IT IS REALLY, REALLY WORHTLESS. Save your money"
2,"Good idea, bad execution","My 4 children (ages 5-9) like it but don't play with it much. That's because it's in the basement.The slime is the killer. It can't be near carpet or furniture. There's no way to ""pick up"" the slime when you're done. You have to scoop it out of the bottom and you never get it all. Gobs of it stick to the plastic.Most of the other review's horror stories are true. Slimecano is difficult to build, few cars work with the set, and one section's already malfunctioning."
1,slimecano,"This is a miserable toy. It's difficult to assemble and once it is assembled you have to keep re-assembling it because it constantly falls apart. The slime will stain just about any cloth, which means you pretty much have to use the toy outside.It will probably be in the trash in a few months.Spend your money on something else."
3,Daughter loves it!,"Santa brought this to my 4 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! It appears to be quite flimsy, but she and my husband have not had any problems with it falling apart. It took quite a while for ""Santa"" to put it together, but it seems to be holding up fine. Additionally, the cars that she owns (about 5) do not get stuck on the tracks. [...]"
3,"Junk, but my son loves it...","This set is junk- breaks easily- but my son (age 6) wanted it for Xmas and has played with it a ton. Every friend who has seen it is envious, and his little sister (age 2) loves it too. It is expensive but it was his favorite gift this year so I guess it was worth it."
1,You have got to be kidding me?!?!?!,"My 4 year old son begged for this toy for Christmas. Like past experiences with Hot Wheels sets I was reluctant. (Matchbox are 300 times more durable and fun!) The item was a bit difficult to put together and did not stay together! Ours never really shook although it had the sound effects. The cars even the three we found to be light enough never went around the track by themselves. Forget about finding a car to launch! Out of 100 cars maybe 3 almost made it to the top. The slime is awful! Definately do not put the whole container into the top! When the slime runs down the catch basin at the bottom overflows and gets everywhere! It does stain even if wiped up immediately. This was a BIG disappointment. [...]. Maybe next year Hot Wheels will TRY to put out a durable and fun toy but don't count on it. I am so glad my son also got Matchbox Rocket Park playset, it WONDERFUL![...]"
1,Santa's most disappointing delivery!,"Santa brought my 3-1/2 year old son this, his 1st race track. He touched it & part of the track fell off. It is extremely flimsy. Pieces continually fell off as we tried to use the track. Not one of his Hot Wheel cars could actually fit through the race track. After numerous tries, we could use one part of the track if we held the other part up & out of the way. We did not attempt to use the slime on the track.For the money, there are many other quality tracks available. This will end up in the trash."
2,This is not a toy for unspuervised use,"In the words of the magician from Frosty the Snowman......Messy, Messy, Messy, Messy. The Slime sticks to your hands, to your clothes, to the carpet, to the floor, stains the walls, and watch out for your pets. The tracks must be cleaned after use. And where can you find more Slime? This is not a toy for a family whose parents are short on time. With all that said, my boy does love it!"
2,Slimecano a disappointment!,My son received Hot Wheels Slimecano for Christmas and both he and I were disappointed with it. It did not stand up well and the pieces often fell apart. It is rated for ages 5+ but my son is almost 6 and he had trouble using it. We have enjoyed Hot Wheels products in the past but this was a true disappointment!
1,terrible toy!!!flimsy,the worst--just falls apart and very confusing. even older kids get frustrated w/ it
1,Junk - not worth any price,"I returned this junk heap the day after assembling. I just wish I could have got the time back it took to assembly. Mattel, please hire some good quality assurance engineers. This should never have been sold to the public."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"God this is an awful product. My husband chose it, of course. It went right back to the store as soon as I put it together one time. It comes in a million impractical pieces and isn't worth $2. We never even opened the container of slime.Honestly, who in the world came away from the drawing board with the plan for Slimecano? If you are reading this, what the heck were you thinking?"
1,Dont buy junk,THIS TOY IS A PIECE OF JUNK. IT WOULDN'T STAY TOGETHER. I EVEN CRAZY GLUED THE THING TOGETHER AND IS WOULD JUST TIP OVER ANYWAY AND AFTER A COUPLE TIME IT CAM APART ANYWAY. THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY TIMES YOU CAN USE THE SLIME BECAUSE IT IS A MESS AND OF COURSE NO ONE WANTS TO GET IT ON THERE CARPET OR STUCK IN CLOTHE.NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
1,Complain!!,This toy is absolutly the Worst. i called Mattel to complain. Tey sent me a coupon for the purchase price
1,Worst toy ever,"This toy took forever to set up and then there was no real car track for the cars to go on. My 7 year old was very underwhelmed. The slime was cool the first time, and the cleanup was a nightmare making us all want to just get rid of the toy. The slime permanently stained my son's rug and his clothes. This is the very first toy that we threw in the garbage after trying it once. Even my son wanted it gone. Please don't waste your money."
1,Not worth the money,"This product does not work. The tracks don't stay together, the lava pours out of the tracks and onto the surface. Nothing is automatic, the cars all have to pushed through. The picture shows it all being automatic. It is NOT worth the money!"
1,not worth the price,"My 5 year old son received this for Christmas. It took an hour to put together, did not come with cars and none of his hundreds of Hot Wheels fit through the launcher. Difficult for his little hands to set the launcher and push the button. Difficult to get the slime back up to the top. No way a child could do it on their own. I can't believe it didn't come with any cars that fit! A complete waste of money! If my son hadn't begged for this I never would have purchased it."
3,needs more slime,"it's ridiculous that they don't sell extra slime for this product. when the slime dries up, then your out of luck, and you can't find slime anywhere!!!!"
1,in the garbage three months later,"My friend and I each bought our 4-year-old sons this toy for Christmas. By January, both of ours were almost useless from falling apart. She threw hers in the garbage in February. I just asked my son if I can throw his away and he responded, ""Yes, I don't like it anymore. It's broken."" I feel it was a real waste of money for only three months."
1,poor quality especially for the price,"difficult even for a parent to put together. doesn't stay together, keeps coming apart. makes a mess. you have to clean it and put it back together everytime you play. cars get stuck on the tracks--this is NOT a racetrack! Can't get the cars to follow ALL the tracks-really just follows one track. VERY, VERY VERY POOR construction, especially for $45 it is really junk. But my 5 y/o daughter just loves the messy goo, noises, etc--"
1,Don't Buy!,"My son got this for his birthday. It took an hour to put together and then we had to find a car that was light enough for the launcher to propel the car all the way up. Almost all Hotwheels cars do not work and we have hundreds. Then the cars get stuck in these tight corridors. Plus there is the mess of the slime. Once you put it all together, it says that it shouldn't touch carpet, clothes, furniture, walls, just about everything. This is a lot of money and it is not worth it. Do not buy!!!!"
1,Complete waste of money,"My son bought this toy with his birthday money based on the false advertising on the front of the box. This toy is not a race track and yet the picture leads you to believe that it is. Its hard to put together, the cars do not stay on the track and the slime stains everything it touches.What you get is some very expensive slime! My son was completely disappointed, especially when the store would not take it back because the box had been opened.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Whoever made this toy made a lot a money for the company, yet also created a very disallusioned future toy buyer!"
1,This toy is a disaster!,"My son really wanted this for his birthday. It is a total piece of junk. It wouldn't go together right and when we did finally assemble it, it didn't work. The slime gets all over everything and it kept falling apart while we were trying to get it to work. We are returning it tomorrow."
1,Terrible Quality,"I purchased this playset for my two year old son for his birthday. I put it together for him that morning so he could play with it right away. I was very disapointed with the quality of the workmanship of this toy. For $50 I expected more. The launcher would not get the car 2/3 of the way up the ramp. The car would get stuck on the seams between ramps and stop. Good thing my son wasn't home when I finished building it. I quickly took it apart, shoved it back into the box and took it back for a refund. I got him two Tonka trucks and five Hot Wheels cars instead."
1,Landfill Material,"My five-year-old has been begging for this toy for a couple of months and we finally let him have it for his birthday tonight. He had a horrible time trying to find a car that would work with it ... and he has no lack of Hot Wheels cars. The launcher does not have enough force to get any of his cars to the top and he has to help them along by hand. But ... then they get stuck in the too tight spaces and too sharp curves. He's sitting with it now, trying to figure out how to make it function properly, but its not holding his attention enough not to check out the cartoons on tv. The only thing that seems to work is the slime coming out, although not at the proper time ... and that's the only part he seems to be enjoying. I'm sure that when the slime dries out this toy will not be used again. A complete waste of money. If your child is into volcanoes, as mine is, I'd recommend trying to find a volcano kit in the kids science aisle instead. Skip this bit of junk."
2,Pick a different playset...,"Slimecano takes forever to put together. Once together, My kids had fun with it- but only because of the slime. Cars get stuck and pieces constantly fall off. The slime is the best feature and it makes a mess! We bought Cyborg Attack later and it is so much better."
1,Totally Taken,"We purchased this for my 5 year old son. It is absolutely cheap. Our sons intrest has moved from Thomas the train to hot wheels. The quality does not compare. Thomas I will save for the rest of my children and will keep for their children. I cant wait to get this out of my house. Unfortunately, we purchased Cybog the salt something or other as well. That one is just as bad. Neither one work. What a disapointment."
1,TERRIBLE TOY,"This is the only gift my son asked for the Holidays and both he and I were terribly dissapointed. It was difficult to put together and didn't work when we did get it assembled. It also fell apart easily. My five year old thought the slime was cool, but it was almost impossible to remove from the toy for storage. If you don't put the slime in a sealed container it dries up. Additionally, the slime stained our carpet and clothes."
2,Aaaaargh! Piece of JUNK!,"Please don't buy this toy. You will be SO SORRY. Mine was actually broken IN the box, but my son desperately wanted it and so I put it together anyhow...the think is a rickety piece of junk that breaks if you look at it cross-eyed. The slime is an utter abomination and the playset is monstrously huge. It took up almost my entire dining room table.I got suckered into this one by my son- but NEVER AGAIN! I am not buying ANY more Hot Wheels Playsets, ever...no matter how much he begs.For the price, you'd be better off with a dixie cup and a concrete driveway!"
1,waste of money,"My 8 yr. old son received this toy for Christmas. He HAD to have it! He played with it maybe twice. It's more of a mess than it's worth. I think he thought it would be just like in the commercial. Needless to say, I'm returning it. If you don't put some type of plastic underneath the toy, when you pour the slime into the volcano, it goes all over your floor. NOT good for carpet! I wouldn't recommend buying it."
3,Be Creative and have an open mind,"Ok, i have to agree with the above reviews as well. However, My 4 year old little boy wanted this toy for Christmas..and of course got it. He loves it. Ok, the quality for the price may not compare but he doesn't seem to be frustrated with the the issues of cars not going up the track etc. He actually thinks its fun to push them up and do it on his own. He is definatley being creative and using his imagination and I love that. The slime factor is a little scary....so the slime doesn't come out unless their is adult supervision and it's only on the tile. No problems so far and he loves the cars crashing in the goo."
2,OUTSIDE ONLY TOY,"I highly recommend that this toy be used OUTSIDE only. My 12 year old daughter put the thing together for her 7 year old brother it took her about 35 mins. We never got it to work properly like on TV (Cars wouldn't launch properly) but my son had a blast with it anyway. The slime is a mess but the toy can be cleaned up easily with a hose, clothes and child are a different story, slime will stain. Main drawback is like with any large Hot Wheels toy.. what do you do with it after the child is done playing with it? It's too large to store in one piece but once it is taken apart the pieces never fit back into the box properly and then you end up with lost or missing pieces and it never gets reconstructed again. Overall review.. my son loved it but not sure I got my money's worth out of it."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I bought this for my 6-year-old son for Christmas. First of all, it wasn't the easiest thing to put together. Once it was together, the cars wouldn't run on it smoothly and pieces kept coming off of it. It's made out of cheap plastic and the head on the top wouldn't stay together like it supposed to. I tried two different sets of batteries and it still wouldn't work. I had a VERY disappointed boy, but I already took it back to the store and I promised him that we could go shopping for something else. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"

2,Not bad for folks who don't mind struggling with language and concept -,"I was looking for something fresh and interesting, but did not find it here. It suffers from a problem I find in many books of this genre; the author wastes so many words talking up his method that his passion dies down before he gets to the subject matter. If you are a beginner, the books by Fincham, La Rue, Mahabal and the brilliant Richard Unger will take you a lot further a lot faster. If you've already gotten the basics, those books will offer new insights or fresh perspectives. This one asks you to throw out your system, but does not offer much to replace it with."
4,a memoir by Beverly Clearly,"_A Girl From Yamhill_ by Beverly Clearly is a memoir. She writes about her memories of Beverly's early life to where she escapes her home to go to junior college in California.Beverly tells us when her first baby tooth came out, when she recieved her first love letter from a boy she liked for 3 years. Beverly also tells us about her first date Gerhart she despised.It is a great book that everyone will love."

3,Insightful and Basic Spiritual Words,"I found this pocket-size book by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to be inspirational and helpful. You do not have to be a Buddhist to understand what the Dalai Lama has written because this is merely a practical guide, and should not be taken as serious literature if you intend to convert or truly understand Buddhism. It offers enlightenment.There were several good points about this book. However, I did have some disagreements when it came to the Dalai Lama's discussions about particular subjects. He appeared vague and ambiguous. Or probably he was offering the reader to delve deeper within their own faculties to understand his point, if there was one to get at. For one thing, the question and answer format of the book did appear as if it would appeal to the juvenile group.Overall, his words can appeal universally to readers of all ages looking for a positive outlook in a world that is least than perfect. I recommend this book."
3,"Sorry, they can't all be 5-star reviews.","In the first half of this book, His Holines the Dalai Lama dispenses the simple wisdom so familiar to readers of some of his other texts. Based on a talk given by His Holiness in Great Britain, the first half of the book has all of the easy ebb and flow of any open, honest discussion. It is charming, disarming, and profound.The second half of the book, however, consists of a series of sometimes esoteric, exclusively Buddhist questions and answers. This Buddhist catechism is undoubtably of great value to Buddhist parents seeking to raise observant Buddhist children. It probably serves well for new converts to Buddhism, also. However, for the rest of us, the second half of the book can quickly become dry and boring.His holiness has so many great books in print, please do yourself a favor, unless (1) you are seeking to raise good Buddhist children, or (2) thinking of converting, read something else."

4,"Right shoes, but...","First of all these shoes are not ""Newly Manufactured"".

1,You can fool many people a lot of the time.,"Mr. Null is a charismatic scientifically sounding individual, but a quack nonetheless. His PhD is a fake.

1,A lot of money and a waste of paper,"I've heard about Gary Null for so long that I thought, as someone committed to alternative health, I should know what he's about. Well now I know: and believe me, save your money. A poorly written mishmash full of half-truths more damaging to our movement than it is helpful. Vague advice, at times contradictory: really, hard to believe this was written by an ""expert."" Shame on PBS for promoting this trash!"
5,Get Healthy Now Book,All of the things that I ordered met my expectations . This book met my expectations and I enjoyed reading it.
4,Get healthy now,"This book, which i am still reading, is kind of reference book, and I recommend everybody to read it. It shows you how to eat and live healthy. I've learned a lot from this fantastic book, and I love to have it in my library.1"
1,Where did he come up with this stuff?,"I anxiously awaited this book's arrival, hoping to find an excellent source of nutritional information and life-style enhancements. Being a dentist, I homed in on the chapter on dental care, which was laced with inaccuracies and mis-information! Yes, fluoride is used as rat poison, we've known that for a hundred years. But, to be toxic to humans at the levels used to fluoridate municipal water supplies, you'd have to drink a bathtub-full daily for a month to be dangerous. How long do we have to beat this fluoride horse? Most of the rest of the chapter is also just as inaccurate. My point is this. As a dentist, I know my area of expertise. If I cannot trust the information given on dental care because I know it's wrong, how can I rely on the other nine hundred plus pages of guidance on areas I have less knowledge about? My advice? Save your money."
1,GET SMART NOW!,"and skip this obnoxious man's rant. He's out to promote one thing -- Gary Null, Inc. Eat right, exercise, respect your body and save your nickel."
1,This is a poorly-written and vague tome.,"I decided to buy this book after seeing Gary Null speak on a fundraiser and also because his alternative medicine practices saved my friend's life after she was diagnosed with stage 4 endometrial cancer.However, I was very disappointed by the book's tone, which infantilizes the reader with qualifyers in alomst every statement, and offers no real specific information in an easy-to-access manner.The book is unwieldly and it's weight is not justified by the content. Null and his editor seem to have just reinforced his tv rhetoric in print. The book reads like a supermarket tabloid about health and alternative medicine. The segment on care of toenails is laughable. You get more info about toe hygiene from a woman's magazine.Too much vague info. I'm springing for the shipping and sending it back."
1,Don't Blame the Patient,"Mr. Null (and I use ""Mr."" purposely) is indeed from another planet. I am a cancer survivor - several times over. According to Mr. Null, my getting cancer is my fault. Thank you, sir. It's not enough trying to deal with the disease, now you make it my fault for getting it. If you're looking for a good book on nutrition, look elsewhere. This guy is way out of line in many areas. After seeing him on PBS, I had to see if he was really saying what I thought I heard. He is. He is saying you are to blame for anything that ails you. Whatever is wrong with you, you are to blame. His superior attitude comes across in his writing and he presents his half-baked theories as if they were tenets from a magnificent faith. This book is self-aggrandizment on a monumental level."
5,BEST OVERALL PERSONAL HEALTH BOOK,Get Healthy Now is the best book that Gary Null has written that covers all aspects of health. It explains how to correct almost any problem you may develop but most of all it show you how to get into a healthier preventative mode so you can really take care of yourself.The range of items in this thousand page book covers is amazing - from how to treat a blister on your foot that you may develop from your marathon training program - to healthy recipes - to what the current approaches for serious life threatening illnesses are. Im using this book as my personal health bible for my family and would highly recommend to any one interested in improving their life.
3,Obsolete,Good contents but completely out of date. Don't know which version of PhotoDeluxe they were using but it certainly wasn't the current edition.
3,The fun wears out,This toy was fun when we first bought it but now our 12mth daughter only plays with it when we play with her or she'll use it just to get a hold of something while she's standing. She likes to stick anything and everything in the top holes as well as the spiral part where the balls roll down. It was good for teaching her to put the balls in the holes and push and to grab them when they come out the bottom and do it again but now that she knows it's not that fun anymore and there's not much else we can do with it.
1,CHEAP CONSTRUCTION!,"I recently was given this toy by my mother. After reading the directions I spent over an hour trying to assemble this toy. The key word there was TRYING. NO I never finished assembling the toy. Most if not all of the pieces that were supposed to snap into place were not aligned with the correct holes. And the reason I didn't finished assembling it was because the top of it which is supposed to ""snap"" on like the directions say, bent. The more I tried to straighten it out the more it bent. In the end I had to return it. I would definitely highly recommend NOT buying this toy. It's more trouble then it's worth."
3,Doesn't work right although music and lights are fun,This is impossible to assemble correctly since the tracks don't fit well. It doesn't affect the performance of the balls as they roll down the tracks. The biggest problem is that the toy doesn't light up and play music every time that a ball is pushed through the hole. Very confusing for a baby!! This toy is fun but it's just not made or tested well. I'm returning this one.
5,His favorite Christmas present,"My 7-month-old received many toys for Christmas this year. However, this is the only toy he consistently likes. He loves all of the lights and dances to the music. The toy actually has gotten him to start pulling up b/c he was so curious to see the top of the tower and to play with it. Very glad I purchased this!"
3,OK,"Bought this toy for my 10 month old, and the first day he played with it. He likes the balls more than the toy. Since he is teething and just learning to walk, he uses the toy to hold on to, when he is reaching for something off the tables to put in his mouth, but my Nephew who is 18 months old like its, maybe once my son gets older he will enjoy it."
3,I LIKE IT,"MY 7 MONTH OLD ENJOYS PULLING HIMSELF UP, WALKING AROUND IT AND PLAYING THE MUSIC. HE DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE BALLS YET. HE HASN'T TIPPED IT OVER, BUT THERE WERE A COULPE OF CLOSE CALLS. YES IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE BOTTOM HEAVY, BUT ONCE THE BABY IS STEADY ON THEIR FEET, IT'S QUITE A CUTE TOY. THE MUSIC MIGHT BE ANNOYING TO ADULTS, BUT HE LIKES TO BOUNCE TO IT, AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS"
3,Fun But Be Careful!,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 9 months old. He loved the lights, music and watching the balls roll down. BUT...(...)this was advertised as a pull-up toy and every time my son tried to pull up on it, it toppled over. If this product is to be used as a pull-up it should be weighted on the bottom..other than that, he still plays with it at a year old. He now walks and presses the blue button too hear the music play."
5,My son's favorite toy!,"We got this for our son when he was 9 months and he loved it. He is now 13 months and it is still his favorite toy. He dances, sings and plays with it. He also loves to play with the balls that came with it, they are the perfect size for him to pick up and throw. THis is the one toy he has played with daily and for long periods.I love it because it entertains him so well."
2,Boring.,My 12 month old son is a ball fanatic! But he was bored with this toy after 5 minutes. It was not worth the aggravation of putting it together. It also takes up a lot of room.
3,not that great,My son got this for christmas. It was a pain to put together and he never really played with it much. When he did he would just loose the balls and I cant find anymore in the stores that fit it. Alright toy but not my favorite Fisher Price product .
3,Not Sturdy Enough To Support Baby,"Despite its name, this toy is not sturdy enough to support a baby using it to stand up. Several times my daughter pulled it over on top of herself. Once it hit me to wedge one of the ""feet"" under the couch, it's working out to be a pretty good toy. My daughter likes to press the button on top and ""dance"" to the music. All in all, it's an OK toy. And it was a gift, so I don't feel ripped off, but I would have if I spent $20 on it."
2,not worth it,We bought this for our son when he was 9 months old and standing. It tips easily and certainly does not keep his attention. He has used it maybe 5 times in 6 months. Not worth the money
2,What fun music?,"I got ripped off. I thought I had bought the one with the handle to turn the balls and more than one song. The one I got, only plays a very short blurp of music and then thats it. I see that play skool makes two, make sure YOU get the right one!"
3,cute but boring,"My son received this product when he was two, and six months later he never touches it - i think that it is a very durable toy, it plays cute music, but the kids get bored with it very quickly - you can only watch a ball roll down a slope so many times without getting tired of it - save your money for their college tuitions!"
4,Love it but it even tips when baby is sitting down,My 10 month old loves the toy. He is not standing yet but trying to pull himself up on things. Everytime he tries to pull himself up on this toy he falls backward. They should either change the name of the toy or make it heavier on the bottom so it does not tip. It even tips if he is sitting on the floor trying to put a ball in the hole by reaching up. We love the music and If I am helping him stand he loves it but I would never leave him alone with it.
1,Be careful,"I would rate this toy no stars if I was able too.We had a huge issue with this toy. Last week my son who just turned 3 got his arm stuck in the middle ball shoot on this toy. It took us 35 min. to get his arm out. He was stuck up to his elbow and we couldn't get him out with out having to break the toy apart, we also had to use soap in order to get him unstuck. This is not the first time this has happened but he was much smaller the first time so he was easily freed. Please be extremly careful. His elbow is still all brusied and he has a few cuts from the plastic still on his arm. I hope you will read this before buying this toy."
4,"Loud, annoying and ill-made","My daughter recieved this as a gift for her 1st birthday. She did like it quite a bit, but it's so loud, and the music is grating to adult ears. I could have handled the noise if the toy had been made a little better. The pieces hardly fit together so the balls were always getting stuck half way down. The worst part though, is that the base is not weighed with anything. My daughter would hold on to it, the toy would start sliding on our wood floors, and she'd end up falling down or on her knees with the toy on top of her. It went in the recycling bin about a week after we got it. We kept the balls, which she still plays with."
3,Toy need to be weighted more,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old son and everytime he plays with it, he either lifts it up on himself or is pulling up on it and it falls on top of him. For a pull up toy, it is much too light!! There needs to be much more weight to the base in order to be able to use it properly. The music is enjoyable and he loves to watch the balls go down the slide. I wouldn't really recommend this toy if you have a very active child."
4,Stimulating lights &music you can dance to,"I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was less than a year. It is the one toy that really holds her attention. When a ball is placed into one of the top openings the ball spirals down the cylinder into an opening near the bottom of the toy where it then goes inside the cylinder and will resurface through one of the four openings at the bottom of the toy. My child really enjoyed trying to find which opening the ball comes through. She is older and it is still one of her favorite toys. The flashing lights and happy music is stimulating to the eyes and ears. When she successfully put the ball into the ball blaster, she is rewarded with music that sounds like carnival music. The toy lights up and so does she."
1,It trapped my daughters hand,"we've had this toy for a while now, and imagine our dismay when we heard our daughter screaming.She had got her armstuck in the middle of the toy and could not get it out again, we literally had to break it open to get the arm out."
5,A GREAT TOY,"We bought this for my little boy for Easter. Because he was too little for candy and he loved it, still does. It came w/ four balls which he managed to lose all of now. But the thing he likes to do most is hit the button on top of it that makes it play music, hold on to it and dance. He does this repeatedly through out the day. Although, since he lost all the balls (due to them rolling under chairs and such) he puts all kinds of different things in the holes now, from the remote controls, his own little toys, to empty baby tylenol bottles (he likes to chew on the rubber top). We even found our cell phones in it one time! This is definetly worth the money. Out of all the different toys we've bought for him, this SERIOUSLY is the best one I can think of....he plays w/ it more than anything else and we love to watch him play w/ it. We also like seeing all the different things he finds to stick inside it."
1,VERY DANGEROUS DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,"When trying to see where the ball had disappeared to, our inquisitive 18month old proceeded to put her entire arm down the center hole of this toy! Her arm became firmly lodged and stuck right up to her shoulder. After piercing screams from the poor little thing,we were able to tear the entire toy apart after what seemed an eternity. She came out of this with only a few bruises but really this should not have happened in the first place. Not only is this toy dangerous, it really never captured our daughter's interest after the initial fun of hearing the music. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this!"
1,Needed 911 Help,"This item was given as a gift. We loved it when we first received it. Unfortunately, when my daughter was 11 months old I had to call 911 because she had her arm stuck inside the center hole. I was unable to get her arm out and it took 3 EMTs to remove her arm. I was told by one of the EMTs that this wasn't the first time he has seen this with the toy. I have called Fisher Price and they are looking into the safety end and a possible recall of this item."
2,Pass on this one,"This was a gift for my 2 year old and initially he and my 3 year old played with it quite a bit. The music was annoying the first time I heard it and it grew more irritating in time. It started to break almost immediately and we weren't able to get it to consistently work well after the first repair job. The boys tired of it eventually anyway. There are much better toys out there with a similar concept which we have purchased since and this toy is in the basement now, awaiting our next yard sale. Definitely not worth the money."
1,Danger,My daughter was 13 months and would stick her hand down the opening in the middle to try and find the balls. Her arm got stuck and bruised.
2,Busy Ball Popper or the Stand Up Ball Blast?,"For those of you looking at both of these toys, my son would say ""get the Busy Ball Popper first"" (if he could talk). (He doesn't care that the Ball Blast won the 2001 Parents Choice award.)My son has had both of these since he first started standing (about 10 months ago). We thought the Stand Up Ball Blast would encourage him to ""Stand Up""... but ironically, he first stood up on his own in front of the Busy Ball Popper! (He wanted to see all the action up top).The Busy Ball Popper has far more music and action. Our son loves hitting the big Red button and trying to grab the balls as they fly everywhere. Meanwhile, the Ball Blast has ONE song (that gets old fast) and the balls do little more than roll in a circle (if your child can even see them while standing up).Granted, these two toys might serve a different purpose. But bottom line, our son plays with it FAR more than the Ball Blast."
3,Piece of Junk,"We received this as a gift and were really disappointed. My daughter was 7 months old and was just learning to pull herself up. The name ""Stand Up Ball Blast"" and the handles at the top lead me to believe that this would help my daughter learn to stand. When she tried to use the ball blast to stand, it would either tip over on her or the wheel at the top would break off. The toy lasted four days in our house before we took it back to Babies R Us...broken and all. The Stand Up Ball Blast looks fun, but it's really a piece of junk."
3,can be dangerous,I have a three year old and a nineteen month old daughter. They like this toy but my nineteen month old reaches down into the middle and tries to get the ball back and in doing so has gotten her arm stuck down the middle I don't know how many times. The opening is small enough to where she can't get her arm back out without my help.
3,Not too crazy about this one,"I thought I would be very happy with this toy. Our daughter got it for Christmas and we took it out of the box when she was 6 months old. Its bright, its colorful, it lights up and plays music but I would not have designed it this way. You put the ball in the top and it spins and shoots it off to one side. Then you would THINK that it would fall down by itself into the track to spin towards the bottom. But the openings for the balls are too small!! The spin off and then just sit there. You have to shove them through the opening orjust skip the top part and drop them down below. This makes no sense to me and my daughter cant figure it out. She wants to watch the ball spin down the track, not have to figure out how to get the ball TO the track.This isnt one Id give as a gift or recommend to anyone. Also there is no place to store the balls and after an hour of play one went missing and we still havent found it."
3,Mixed feelings about this toy.,"My son loved this toy from the time he had it. He got it for his first birthday, and he is now 3 & 1/2 and still looks for this toy to play with. My problem with it, is that the top red ring never stays on. It's constantly falling off, and I am so sick and tired of putting it back together every five minutes! I finally hid it in the basement, even though my son loves it so much. I have twin infants at home and just do not have the time to keep putting this back together! I do think it would easily tip over on a child using it to ""pull up"". Although, my son was already walking by the time he got this toy, and so he didn't use it in that fashion."
2,Not much fun,"My son doesn't really like this toy. I mean he likes the music which is very upbeat and he likes to play with the balls but he doesn't actually like to play with the toy as a whole. And there are the four ""feet"" on the bottom, that are so large they take up so much space on the floor and I don't really see a need for the ""feet"" at all. Plus the toy can't really be put away. We got this as a gift, it is not something I would have bought."
2,over-rated,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old and he was not impressed; neither was I. It is so flimsy(kept unsnapping) and it tips over way to easy. He played with it for about 5 minutes and that was it. The only thing he continued to play with was the balls(throwing them around the house). Don't waste your money, it is very over-priced."
5,My boys LOVE this toy,"I received like a gift because I asked for it. After I opened, my boys tried to play with it. At the beggining, they didn't reach the top, but after a while they learn how to get up, throw the ball in the diffent holes, start the music, etc. For me the most cuttest thing is when one of my boys is playing in the family room, and he remember that toy in his bedroom and go to play with it, also with the lights of the room off (he likes to watch the lights). They also enjoy play just with the balls... they go to hard floor and they throw it and laught when they see what happened... they also hide the balls, so be prepared.... I recommend this toy 100%, you will not regret it"
2,its ok,"this is a ok item, my son played with is a few times, but ut has tipped over on him when he was first learning how to walk, but other than that it is great"
3,MIxed emotions,"My daughter loved this toy, and my nephews did too when they came to play, and the kids that I babysit, so the purchase has been well worth it. I still have it in the closet, waiting for my 4 month old to get older to play with it. I loved that the kids had alot of fun with the toy, after all that's important. I never had any safety issues. It never toppled or anything with my daughter (she's 4 now) She actually learned to stand with this toy, and loved it. Occasionally she'll get it out of the closet and play with it but of course at 4, it doesn't last long. I do agree with some of the other reviews that it should have some place to store the balls. They're constantly being lost. I was able to find some little balls that fit in there and work great with it because we have lost a few. Great concept, just needs a few adjustments."
4,Good toy overall,"We have had this toy for 3 years now and its been through 2 of my kids and countless babysat kids. Everyone loves it and in 3 years we have only had to change the batteries once. It would be better if there was a way to collapse it for storage and someplace on/in it to store the balls which are forever being lost. Also, the music gets beyond annoying, more variet would be better. The kids love this toy and so do the cats."
4,"Kids love it, a little unsteady","My 15 month old son and 28 month old nephew absolutely love this toy! It's the perfect height for them to pull up on, which is a problem because it is extremely lightweight and tends to topple over easily. Just make sure it's not near anything sharp and the kids will have a ball!"
4,"gp, mother of 9yr, 14mo & edd 3/21/04","My 14 month old received this from his Grandfather at about 8 months at the urging of another Mother at the store. Gavin still loves playing and dancing along to the music. Not overall education, other than learning what does & doesnt(you have to watch this one)fit, but does teach cause and affect."
3,Looks like a wonderful toy but my daughter got quite bored,"I thought this toy looked like so much fun, but my 1 year-old daughter didn't play with it nearly as much as I thought she would. The thing she did the most with it was stand on top of it! My daughter is quite the climber. So for that reason I know it is a very durable toy. I would still reccommend it even though my daughter didn't play with it much because I think most children would enjoy playing with it."
4,Concerned Mom from NJ,"My daughter, 12 months, really enjoys this for periods of time. The only real thing to learn is where to put the ball so that it slides down the chute and plays music. It's an alright toy but recently, my daughter has gotten her hand stuck in the slot where you put the balls. It has happened twice now and she has gotten really scared. I'm going to call Fisher Price and let them know."
4,Unstable and Falls Over,"We bought this for our 7 month old boy. The center column is weak and wobbly. In addition, the base is to small. When our son grags on this toy to stand up, it invariably falls over. Great idea, but save your money."
3,Not Safe!,This is advertised as a pull up toy but when my grandaughter pulled up on it the toy fell over. She hit her head on the floor and got a big huge bump and bruise and the toy landed on her and gave her a swollen lip. Other's have told me that they've had trouble with this toy too. A friends little boy got his arm caught in it and couldn't get it out. They spent 30 minutes getting his arm out and he was all scratched and cut up. I really don't think a toy should be out on the shelf if it's not safe.
4,Not too sturdy,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter hoping it would help her in her quest to learn to pull up. It looks like it should be sturdy enough--unfortunately one more than one occasion she has pulled it over. Also, it tends to slide out from under her when she's standing & holding on. At 11 months, she does enjoy putting balls in the various holes, & pressing the musical face on the top of the toy."
4,Not what it's cracked up to be,"My daughter received this as a gift. It seemed to be easy to put together but it's not. The balls get stuck at the end because of the track and the top comes off easy if you pull on it. The thing that gets me is that my daughter was only 8 months when she received the gift and it says she can pull her self up to stand. It comes right down on her everytime and she falls backwards and hits her head. I let her play with the balls and the sounds but she got the idea not to pull her self up with it or she gets hurt. This is not a toy for them to pull them self up, it not heavy enough."
2,Beware of this toy,"Although my 10 month old son loved this toy, he was able to pull it over on top of himself, which caused a major bump on the head. It is not sturdy and any child who is learning to stand or is uses it for balance will either fall on it or pull it over on top of themselves. We're putting it back into the box and bringing it back to the nearest toys ""r"" us. There are plenty of other toys out there that are just as entertaining and much less dangerous."
2,Not stable at all,My daughter got this for her first birthday. She was not pulling up yet. This toy would tip over so easy. She would not even try to pull up. I sold it in a yard sale a few weeks later. Bad choice. I don't recommend. The ball popper she got last christmas is a better bet. She still uses it. She's now 18 months old. Even her 4 year old sister likes to play with the ball popper!
4,Wonderful toy!,"My nine month old was only slightly interested in this toy. She was mostly interested in watching my 7 year old and 3 year old laughing and playing together while playing with it. The fact that they played together was amazing in itself but it also kept them busy for at least a solid hour each time they pulled it out. I love the toy but it seemed more entertaining for older children. If it was just for my baby, she liked the music but there are more accessible toys for her entertainment."
2,This toy is not safe for it's purpose,"My 9 month old got this as a gift and it looked like a really good toy for him as he is starting to pull himself up and stand. But he is still young and very wobbly. After the struggle to get the pieces put together properly, we tried it out and the balls get stuck halfway down because one part of the spiral hangs down about half an inch too low. When we hold that up, my son loves putting the ball at the top. But when he stands holding on to the top with a NON WEIGHTED base, it slides right along the floor. He could have fallen flat on his face if I wasn't sitting there. If this toy is advertised as great for kids pulling themselves up on and standing, I do not feel it is safe for that purpose. I'm putting this one away until my son is a little more sturdy on his feet."
3,New Mom,"I recently bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter. She seems to enjoy it. She likes to listen to the music and watch the lights flash. And she just loves playing with the little colored balls it comes with. Although one thing that dissapointed me about this toy is my daughter is now at that age where she is beginning to pull herself up on her feet, and although the manufacturers claim this is a good toy to encourage that, it is no where near stable enough to handle even an 8 month old's weight. So as long as a parent is supervising their child, otherwise it could be pulled back and fall on top of the baby, it's a pretty fun toy for babies to play with."
3,yes ilike it!!,"my name is tiffany and i bought this toy for my 18 month old, and i have to say i love it.lexy learned alot with this toy. but it diddnt hold up very well with her playing on it every day."
3,Pull-Up not recommend,I bought this for my son when he was about 6 mnths old. He loved it he is now 2 and I recently passed this on to a freind but he still loved the music. It was tricky to put together and I don't recommend the child use it to pull up on because it topples over quite easily however it is light and not apt to hurt the child. I found this sort of annoying but my son loved it and it really helped me to teach him colors using the differnet colored balls that come with it!
4,A must have!,"Although this toy is not very sturdy for pulling up on,once a baby can stand well it is great toy.My son absolutely loves it.It entertains him (and all of us)for a good long time.The lights and music he loves.My son loves the balls that come with it and plays with them nonstop.A lot of the time he is playing with them alone and not with the ball blast.A baby must have!"
4,"Fun, But Be Careful","I bought this for my 8 month old son and he loves it. It's the only toy that can hold his attention for more than ten minutes. He was trying to play with it while I was putting it together. I was surprised with how fast he caught onto it. It was one of the most difficult toys I've put together. It doesn't seem like it would be hard to put together, but it is. My son is pulling himself up on everything and I thought this would be great for that, but it is very unsteady for a little one to pull onto. I tried to put it against the couch, but it is still unstable, so I watch him very closly when he plays with this. Otherwise, it is a great toy and my son really enjoys it."
5,Funtastic!,"Bought this toy for my 18 month old grandaughter's visit. She loved it so much that I had to buy another one and have it shipped to her home (after assembly, the cost of shipping is ridiculous). It makes cool noises and an electronic song but, there's a ""secret"" switch that can be used to lower the volume or turn the volume completely off, in case Grandpa wants to take a nap."
4,falls over easily,"I do like the sounds and lights of the pull up ball blast, however when my son pulls himself up on it the whole thing falls over with him. I do believe that the toy could be a little more stable if it is meant for babies to learn to pull up on."
3,This toy is fairly fun,I thought this toy would be more of an interest to my 16 month old than it was. It's fairly simple. You drop the balls in and then watch them go down the slide. For a while it's interesting to find the balls and wonder which chute the will exit but the play value wears off rather quickly.
3,"Jazzy music, sometimes fun","I purchased this toy when my son was about 10 months old. At the time, he didn't know what to do with the balls - so I had to place them so they went down the spiral ramp. While the music is upbeat and the toy does light up, it didn't hold his attention. He was at the stage of ""cruising"" and tried many times to stand up while holding onto the ball blast, but it isn't very sturdy. He did start to ""get it"" at about 13-14 months old, but still didn't find very much interest in it. The balls are easily lost (I know they must be somewhere in my house, just have no clue where!), as we are down to one ball. Fisher-Price doesn't offer replacements to my knowledge."
2,junk,"This seemed to be a pretty fun toy for young ones. It is made by Fisher Price. How could it go wrong? Well, right from the start. This thing is put together like junk. Did the engineers ever try to assemble this thing? I could not get the plastic pieces to fit properly. I even read the directions to assemble the item. I was never able to use this item before I returned it."
1,Definitely not a safe toy,"My son was also injured when he tried to pull himself up on this toy. The base is not sturdy enough to hold a baby's weight. He pulled the toy over onto himself and received a bump on the head as a result. He has never been very interested in this toy. He will once in a while walk over to it and hit the button to play the music, but for the most part this toy just sits in my basement collecting dust."
5,Great toy!!!,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 7 months old thinking that she could grow into it. I was right! I put her next to it standing up and it wasn't long before she figured out what to do to make the music start. When she was first starting to pull up it tipped, so we'd stand her up by it and now that she's a bit older she can pull up on it without any problem, she also figured out how to squat to get to balls at the bottom, and now she cruises around it. It's amazing how many milestones this toy has helped her acheive. The best part is that she loves it!!! She loves learning how to do everything and she loves to dance to the music!!!! One of the best toys we have!!!"
5,If you'd like to see your baby dance...,"This is one of the best toys out there. Its entertainment value is beyond measure when your child starts to pull himself up and dance his little heart out. The music is great...it isn't Mozart. (Not saying Mozart isn't great, it is just since my child was born all we hear is classical music.) The music is a fast Techno beat with a giggle thrown in for good measure. Not only is this toy great for kids, our cat loves it too! I give this the ultimate praise. It is a must have."
5,Have a dancing good time!,"Our son received this toy as a gift for his first birthday. He loves it! He pulls up, puts a ball in, and dances to the music. While having fun, he is improving his hand-eye coordination and strengthening his legs. This is a must if your child likes to dance. Our son thinks the balls are alot of fun right by themselves. The music is cheerful and adults like to dance to it too - it's not annoying like other musical toys. buy it - your child will love it!"
3,not so great,"there are better ""ball"" toys out there. my kids have loved ""pound a ball"" and the tomy ball mazes."
4,What a catchy Tune!!,"I purchased this toy for my 11 month old and she loves it. Its one of the few toys out there that doesn't annoy me when it goes off. The only problem is the balls don't always end up in the same bay and she doesn't know to look for them. Also, she is able to support herself standing up on it and has only tipped over once since Christmas. She loves the balls and my 2year old also enjoys this toy. In fact I think she understands it much better then the baby."
1,"Pain to assemble, ended up being defective.","I had a hard time assembling the toy, especially the part where you have to put on the 'feet' and the rings. Once assembled, it didn't work. The ball kept getting stuck on the bottom ring. I returned the toy and don't want to see it ever again!"
3,dangerous,"My son loves to crawl to something and pull up and stand,so I bought him this. He pulls it over on himself and has hit his face several times. I finaly got frustrated and threw it in the closet. I do not feel that it is safe, the base is not heavy enough to support a child trying to pull up."
4,BEWARE,Daughter loved it but pulled it down on her self (in less then 5 minutes after seeing it) as she tried to pull up on it. This problem could be solved if the base was big enough for a child to stand/ sit on it as they play or if the base was heavier then the top wheel so it wouldn't be so top heavy. BEWARE OF THIS TOY! My duaghter (nine months old) got a black eye and busted lip because of this toys' design flaw.
5,Great fun!,"Our 12 month old received this present for Christmas when he was only 3 months old. By the time he was 6 months old he enjoyed the sound and lights and the colorful balls. Now that he is 12 months old and can stand on his own it is his favorite toy. It did topple a bit when he was first learning to pull up, but now that he has more balance it is more stable.He loves getting the balls from the bottom and putting them in the holes on top and watching them go down again. He will stand there for almost an hour playing with this toy!"
3,Unstable & What happens when you lose the balls??,"My two year old has one of these and my baby is starting to get interested in it. I found it to be unstable to a child who is learning to stand/walk on their own. And my son was two before he figured out the purpose of this toy. And, my dog chewed up the balls that came with it - so we're using other toys to shove down the holes... Where do I get more balls.Honestly, I've not figured out what this toy is useful for. But, it was a gift."
3,Don't waste your $$,This toy topples over & the balls don't usually come out a chute--they get stuck underneath the base. Disappointing.
4,Too Young!,"Great toy, but I introduced it too soon. Your baby really shold be standing without the use of much support or it's just too frustrating for both baby and parent. I put it away and re-introduced it a couple of months later (10 months) and it was a big hit! I guess I'll listen more carefully to manufacturer's age guidelines from now on....even though we all like to think our little one's advanced!"
2,You Can't Pull Up and the Balls Don't Blast,"I bought this toy for my 9month old son. He is excellent at standing and has been pulling himself up and ""cruising"" for a month now. This toy couldn't support his weight at all. He is about 22lbs now. As soon as he reached to pull himself up, it toppled over. I found that the front of the box doesn't say what the toy ""really"" does. It doesn't allow your child to pull up and the balls definitely don't ""blast"" out of it. It also takes awhile to assemble. I definitely don't think this toy is worth buying, especially at the price they're charging. Don't waste your time assembling it, if you aren't sure about keeping it. It's impossible to take apart and return."
2,Not as great as most reviews said. . .,I read most of the reviews on this particular toy which made me purchase it for my 8 month old (I normally find these review to be right on) but when I recieved this toy and put it together I was not impressed! I think the idea is a good one but it just doesn't work!! The balls get stuck on the bottom turn and when I finally push them through they all come out of the same spot! So much for the surprise of which side they will come out of. I called the 800 # as soon as I noticed that it just didn't work & they basically had no helpful advice. They said I may have got a defective one (I'd say!) I even took it apart and put it together again to make sure it was done correct. It looks exactly like the picture on the box but it just doesn't work. I will be returning it to the store!
1,NOT SAFE,THis toy is not safe for pulling up. They toy tipped over when she was doing that. She hurt her back of her head with the floor and her nose with the toy. This toy should be recall.
2,Mom of 9 in Ohio,"I usually like Fisher Price toys, but this one has missed the mark. The toy comes apart very easily and my kiddos lost interest in it pretty quickly. The balls are very easy to lose as well. There are better toys out there that serve the same purpose."
2,Not enough Fun for someone who is One.,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. I have to admit we were impressed by the music it made and the idea that it would encourage him to stand up. But when we sat down to play with him and teach him how to use this product we found that his interest lasted about 5 minutes and then he had more fun throwing the balls around the house. Also, he went to pull himself up using this product and it fell over every time! This toy is not durable enough for a child to use as intended. We are sorry to say this but we would not purchase this item for any child."
2,Not Recommended,"Unstable, flimsy and improperly weighted are words that I would use to describe this product. We returned this item less than 24hrs after buying and assembling it. Our 7-month old, who's been standing with assistance for several months, was easily able to tip the Ball Blast over despite weighing only about 20lbs. The music and sound effects are fun and will surely put a smile on any child's face but the flimsy construction of the lower, yellow ramps are not conducive to bearing a young one's weight. The balls are a nice size for small hands and the adjustable volume control is a good feature. But the product does not live up to expectations and the quality is well below that of other Fisher-Price toys we own. Do think twice about buying this product as an aid to help you child pull up to a standing position. It's great when your baby is standing but the product's imbalance can lead to leaning and tipping over when used as intended."
1,Poor construction,My parents bought an older version of this toy which works great. We were given this version as a gift for our daughter.The track on this never lined up correctly. The balls constantly got stuck and wouldn't go down no matter how many times we tried to fix the problem. If the ball did go down (once we forced them) they would always exit the bottom through the same hole - it's supposed to vary.The music is annoying and loud.This version is missing the hole down the center that my parent's version has. Instead it has a spinning center that doesn't serve any purpose other than to be annoying. The hole in the older version is much more fun and easier for younger children to manage.
4,Nice toy,"My little one loves the sounds that this toy makes and she loves to watch the balls slide down the slope, but you have to push the ball through the hole at the top to make it go and I have to do that for her. I think its a good pull up toy too. She stands up and dances! CUTE"
5,Fun all the way!,"We received this as a first birthday gift and it is still being used four years later! My son was walking by ten months but other children would come over and play with it, who could not walk. Most little ones seemed to gravitate toward it and my son still enjoys the sounds and action, his sister will too I am sure.A great investment or gift."
3,Great toy but the balls stay in the middle section,I got this toy for my son when he was around 6 or 7 months and he loved it especially when he first started standing up he would pull himself up on it...He loves to push the button and make music and also loves to put the balls thru he also pushes on the middle disk to stop it from spinning and it is still working...My son is now 14 months old and he still likes to play w/ it...The problem w this toy is that the balls stay in the middle portion and you have to tip it over to get them out...
5,My daughter loves this toy!,"She loves the music and loves to watch the balls go through. She has recently decided to try and see what different toys will fit down the holes. She has had it for a few months now and it is still one of her favorites. My only concern, I think that they should have made the base heavier, as it isn't terribly sturdy. My daughter likes to flip it over and I kind of wish it wasn't so easy to do! It never tipped when she used it to pull up on, though. Buy it! It is great fun!"
5,very happy,I am very happy with this toy. My daughter got it for her 1st birthday and she loved playing with it. She just turned 2 and she still plays with it once in a while. Definately worth the money! She has had it for a year and still plays with it. Any toy that has kept her attention for a year is worth $20.00.
4,"Fun, but not very sturdy","My sons are 8 months old. I got this toy because I thought it would not only be fun, but it would also be a good standing activity while they were still getting comfortable on their feet. Several times when they have reached down for the balls the whole thing has toppled over on them. I would recommend waiting until they are not relying on it for support before trying this toy."
2,pull-down on my head blast,"I am very disapointed with this product. I purchased it the intention of helping my 9 mo. old son pull himself up by himself. He's at that stage.I called Fisher-Price before I went to the store, they asured me it wouldn't topple over.I thought at first it was my sons wieght, until I read all these reviews.I'm never more than 10 feet away from my son,(unless he's sleeping). With this toy, I need to be right there on top of him at all times when he plays with it. I feel it's more of a danger than a fun toy.I wanted to give him the feeling of independence in trying to lift himself without my help. This is not the toy to do that with."
2,One Trick Pony,"I bought this for my 13-month old son. While it has never tipped over for him, as it has for other reviewers, it is so limited in what it offers that it only holds his attention for a minute or two. The music is tinny and annoying, and there are no ""surprise"" ball exits, as advertised. Pretty much put the balls in through the top (a hole in the center, as in older version would be recommended), watch them spiral down, finished. Yawn."
2,Not Popular With Us,"I bought this toy to try to encourage my daughter to stand up. She never crawled so I thought it wise to get something that would encourage her to stand from a sitting positon so she could finally be mobile. This was a terrible choice. It is not sturdy enough for children to pull up on it. My daughter, who is tiny for her age (now 19 lbs. at 1), topples the toy. She doesn't enjoy putting the balls on the track and could care less about the music and lights. She does however,love the balls. I now keep the balls in an old wipes container that I cut the lid off of and the rest of this is in the corner of her bedroom. It only gets used when my nieces are over (they're 3 and 6). They find this toy engaging for about 5 minutes. It takes me longer to dust the thing off when they want to use it. I'll be putting it away soon and keeping the balls out. This toy might ne good for you if you're looking to entertain your lil one for a few but it won't help them stand at all."
1,BLAH!!!!!,"I must agree with some of the other parents on the panel. This is NOT a very steady toy. My son is 8 months old and wants to stand up all of the time. He attempts to hold on to the handles and pummels to the floor each and every time. Secondly, the kept interest in this toy, sucks, it doesn't hold my son's attention at all. After placing the ball at the top and watching it light up and sing, he pushes it through to watch it roll down to the bottom. After it reaches the bottom, he looks over at me and daddy with a THAT'S ALL, look on his face. Also, this toy isn't very educational at all. What does it teaches a child to do besides get very irritated. Now, the toy just sits in his play area, untouched. Seeing as though our son is the only child in the house, my husband and I try to keep him busy and his creative mind going but this was not a good idea AT ALL, in fact, it was a huge mistake. The three of us truly dislike this toys."
2,OK Toy,This toy was given as a gift for my 9 month old son. He liked to play with the balls by themselves but was not interested in seeing them go down the slides. The music entertained him the most. He liked to push the button and stand there and dance to the music. It was an OK toy because it was a gift. I don't think I would go out and spend my own money on it though. It takes up a lot of space for just a music box and a couple of balls.
5,fun but not recommended,"this toy was amazing fun until my 3 year old nephew played with it. he wanted to catch the ball before it went down the tube. he was unsuccessful at catching the ball, however it took alot of baby oil, time, and red marks to get his arm out."
2,Waste of Money,"We bought this toy when our son was about 12 months old. First of all, assembly was very difficult because the ramps did not align. But the toy was also broken, and never did what it was supposed to. We were disappointed, and had to return in to the store."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this toy.,"This toy looks like a great idea, but the execution is terrible. The toy cannot hold my very petite 9 month old, it either slides out from under her if she pushes on it or topples over on her if she pulls on it.The assembly is a big pain, and it wouldn't come apart without a fight. We took it apart to return it, and I broke every nail I had trying to get it apart again.Finally, and most frustrating, the balls would not roll down the groove all the way because of these bizarre overhangs on the main ""pipe"" of the toy. You have to knock the balls past the sticking point. Very poorly engineered toy!!!"
1,Very unstable and dangerous toy!,"I bought this toy for my 8 month old last week. Although it has cute lights and entertaining music, this is a dangerous toy. It is very unstable and my son has pulled it over onto himself many times while trying to pull up to stand. He hit his face the first day and yesterday bruised himself badly under the eye from trying again to pull up on it. I intend to call Fisher Price to complain. I would not buy this toy!"
2,Disappointed,"First of all, the balls don't just fall down. Baby has to push the ball down through the holes or push a button on the top to make the balls go down. There are 2 spots to store the balls, but there are 5 balls. This toy is not solid. It's a little wobbly once assembled. The noises and lights are not too exciting. There are much better toys out there for the money. The main reason I'm returning this is because I'm afraid my daughter will grab on the handles, try to pull herself up and it will fall over since it's not very sturdy."
1,not impressed,"My son got this toy when he was 8 months old, not only did it repeatedly tip over on him but it was just too loud for him, he failed to show any interest in it at all. I would not recommend this toy to anyone and I find it hard to believe it won an award, obviously the people who rated it never actually bought it for a child they cared about. If you are considering this for a gift, please find something else, I highly recommend the fisher price crawl and cruise playground, my son still plays with it at 16 months. I just can't believe a toy like this would be placed on the market."
4,great toy,"We bought this toy for my daughters 1 year old birthday, she is 16 months now and still loves it. Its a safe toy and sturdy. I would definitley recommend it:)"
2,Not as fun as we thought,"I got this for my son's first birthday. Maybe since he was already pulling up since 6 months and didn't use it to pull up on or stand with he wasn't really that interested. He didn't need it to help him stand up or anything. Anyway, he uses it mostly to stand on to get at things he shouldn't be. Definitely a waste of space."
2,Better for cats than babies!,"We bought this for our 9 month old granddaughter because some other parents had recommended it highly. Unfortunately, we are somewhat disappointed in it. As other reviewers have noted, it was a pain to put together, and it still doesn't seem to fit together quite right. (Maybe this is why the balls always seem to come out the same opening instead of all four.) Also, as other reviewers have noted, it is not very stable; we haven't had a real mishap since it's on carpet, but it's definitely not really designed for pulling-up babies. She likes the goofy sounds it plays, but she hasn't figured out how to put the balls into the openings yet. Also, better than half the time when I put the balls through, no music, sounds or lights are triggered. I discovered that you have to really push the ball against the triggering mechanism to make it play. In short, the cats have more fun chasing the balls around the house than the baby does playing with this toy!!"
3,Not so Stand Up Ball Blast,"Like the concept, but balls are hard to get out of the bottom of the toy. A lot of assembly required. My son (10 months) played with the game briefly and liked to dance to the disco tech music it plays. Over all, I think it's a great concept for babies to learn cause and effect, but my son lost interest when he tried to retrieve the balls, because they either stayed hidden in the bottom of the toy or he would try to grab one that came out and it would slip back into the base of the toy."
3,Can't pull up on this toy without tipping!,"I loved this until I turned around to see my 8 month old daughter lying on the ground with the Ball Blast on top of her! She tried to pull up on it and it ended up tipping towards her. Luckily she wasn't hurt, but my husband wanted to throw it away! It's in the closet now. I'm hoping when she gets older it might work better?"
4,A good toy,"My son got this for his 1st bday, and loves it. It's got some neat funky music that plays when you put the balls down the chute. It's got 2 settings for volume control, and every parents favorite, a shut off switch when you're trying to clean it. My only complaint is that when the balls come down, they don't always go through on the bottom, you have to kind of pick the toy up and move it around for them to come out. He still plays with it and he's 2 now, so it is a toy that will last a while."
3,Fun - but can be dangerous...,"My little boy loves this toy. If it involves balls, he is all over it. However, it is NOT a toy to leave a child with unsupervised.My then 12 month old would stick his hand, then his whole arm down the openings around the top, where they would usually grasp onto to stand up. He would be unable to extract his arm, and in a panic he would lose his balance and fall over. This happened more than once while I was with him in the room with my back turned. You can imagine the fear and pain it could cause a child if the parent or caregiver werent there for immediate assistance.He still plays with it, as it is his favorite toy, but never unless one of us is right there monitoring him. I want to give this toy 5 stars for fun, but that danger factor needs to be considered."
3,Great Fun- But Not Safe,"This toy is noisy, lights up, and little one's love it. We loved it too, until our little girl got her arm trapped in one of the holes on top. This toy is recomended for an age group that still easily loses balance..."
5,A DEFINITE KEEPER!!,"We bought this for our son when he was about six months old. He is now 15 months old and still loves this toy. Before he could stand on his own, he loved to hold on to the rim and put the balls down the chute. He also figured out very early how to squat to get more balls from the floor. (A note: it is not a heavy toy, and was not able to support his weight when he tried to pull himself up--but he was happy to get help getting to his feet from mom or dad, and would then just hang on!) In addition to all of the standing practice our son got, he loved watching for the balls to pop out of the bottom holes. The balls are great for throwing and rolling on their own, too, as they are so lightweight and the perfect size for little hands! Only downside is that the battery compartment is difficult to get to without disassembling the top part of the toy. Definitely worth every penny!"
5,Lots of fun but could be unsafe,"The kids love this toy, and will play with it for hours. Great music and flashing lights but worried about safety. Toddlers will try to follow the ball down through the top and will get there little arms stuck in the hole. Because the hole is long they can often get past their elbow and cant get out because of the height of the toy. The ""crawl and cruise toy has the same concept but holes are not as deep. Buy that one."
4,great toy for intermediate standers,"This toy is great for the infant who already stands, but it is too light for a child just learning to pull up and tends to topple over. Now that my boy has mastered pulling up without leaning backwards he has lots of fun hitting the buttons to make the music and lights go. If you want to use as a learning to pull up toy, you will need to hold down the bottom."
2,Pull Up Ball Blast,I felt the advertising of the Fisher Price Pull Up Ball Blast was very misleading. I was under the impression that when my daughter was learning to pull herself into a standing position that this toy would assist her but everytime she tried to pull herself up it would tip over. Now that she's walking she enjoys putting the balls in the top and watching them roll down. I don't think they should be advertising this as a product for a nine month old.
2,Dangerous Toy!,"This toy tips over very easily and can be very dangerous. It is marketed as a pull up toy to teach children to stand up and has convenient handles at its top. However, it is very unsteady and the first time one of my 9 month old girls grabbed it, she pulled it over and fell flat on her back. After observing my girls fall over a few times, I decided to keep this toy on its side unless I can be there to hold down the bottom part. Takes away the fun. Also, I find that either the center tube is slightly big or the noise button is too short, but pushing a ball down it does not produce a sound. You have to push the button manually."
4,Awesome toy if you can keep up with the balls,"My 1 year old and my 3 1/2 year old love this toy. The only problem is that we keep losing track of the balls. Sometimes the balls get stuck in the middle of the base. My 3 year old has figured this out and can get them out. My 1 year old just thinks he's lost his ball and gets frustrated. Other than that, it is a great toy. I love watching the little one dance to the music. But, again, sometimes putting the balls through the hole doesn't trigger the music. My 3 year old knows which button to push, but it frustrates the little one again. We play with this in the great room and often times can't find any of the balls that go to it. My one year old loves to throw them and then they get temporarily lost! Overall though, they both love it and I'd recommend it."
4,BE CAREFUL!,"Only use this toy when baby is being extremly supervised. I mean literally sitting right next to it. Every time my son tries to pull up on it it starts to tip and I have to hold it down to keep it from falling on him. And when he's standing with it and he leans against it it starts to tip to the other side and I have to hold onto it again. But other than being unsturdy and wobbly, he loves the music and balls."
3,A good toy to grow into,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 8 months old, and it did get her to do what I wanted it to do -- namely stand up and start learning how to put the balls into the right places. She is just now -- at 12 months old -- getting into the toy and having fun with it by herself. So I'd say it's a good toy to get for your child to grow into. If your child is already walking and stacking things or putting things in other things, he/she's probably already outgrown this toy.The toy is kinda flimsy, when she pulls herself up with it, it tips over because it doesn't weigh much. Also, when she leans on it, it bends quite a bit, the balls only ever come out in one place (there are 4 places where they could come out at the bottom of the toy), and they usually get hung up on a seam in the plastic, so she (or I) has to reach in to get it (or, sometimes, all 4) out."
2,This toy is going on a one way trip back to the toy store!,"My 11 month old daughter received this from a family member for christmas. It was very time consuming to put together. Once assembeld my daughter tried to pull her self up and it tipped over. The ball would get stuck in the middle of the slide. Once pushed to the bottom they would only come out one hole. My daughter was very bored with this toy in seconds. If you want a toy that will keep your childs attention, pick up the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Learning Home. It is more expensive and larger (much easier to put together) But it is well worth the money."
5,Great toy!!!,"My daughter played with this at a family member's house when she was only 6 months old. She was already able to stand, so that helped quite a bit. She squealed with excitement as soon as it started to light up and play music. So, I decided to get it for her for Christmas. She is 7 1/2 months old now, but she loves it just as much as she did a month and a half ago. She can't stop playing with it. It wasn't very difficult to put together, there are not that many parts, you just have to figure out how to wedge the tracks on it in the correct order."
2,Hard to set it up!,I bought this and it was very difficult to put together. Not well made at all. I finally gave up after an hour or two of trying to line up the track and pop it in place with out it all falling apart on me. I returned it. (I couldnt even dismantle it again to return it.
2,Don't buy this toy,"unless you want your child to fall over backwards and hit her head on the floor or furniture. Very serious design flaw - the base is not weighted so when your child tried to pull herself up it tips over. If your child is hanging onto it and starts to sit down, it tips over again. I wish I had read the previous reviews before purchasing. I intend to insist that Fisher Price accept a return of this product"
4,FUN....BABY NEEDS SOME BALANCE,this was a gift for my 11mo old...she loves this toy. we had read reviews about it tipping over so we were skeptical. she has been pulling up for only about a month. this doesn't tip over on her at all. she is stable enough to get up and down...just needs some support. i thought she was going to be attacked by the toy...it has worked out great!
5,Multiple ages like it!,"I am a teacher for a childcare center with ages birth to 3 years and even though they recommended age is 6 months and up, I have 4 month old babies mesmerized by just the music alone. They may not be able to put the ball through the slot at that age, but if you do it and show them, they love watching it over and over. The batteries last a long time and I like how you can choose the volume on this toy to. If you have an upset baby on your hands, just press the smiley face and awesome music comes out and pleases the baby to no extent! I am going to buy this for my baby also when she is born. A great toy for all ages, but just like the other reviews, don't let the baby pull himself up on it, just place them there and they are suppossed to HOLD themselves by the handles, not pull themselves up."
2,Don't buy unless your baby can stand on their own,We bought this toy for my 9 mth old. She was just starting to pull up. We had to hold it down each time she would play with it or else it would fall on top of her. I think that maybe Fisher-Price should re-examine the suggested age. We decided to put the toy up until she can stand on her own and not depend on it to pull up. I gave it 2 stars because she loves to push the button and watch the ball spin in the middle.
2,"For ""older"" babies/toddlers","We got this as a Christmas gift for our daughter who was three months. Though we knew it was a toy she would grow into, I was very disappointed. In fact, I gave it to my friend who has an older daughter. You have to push REALLY hard on the balls to get them to go down the spiral, and 9 times out of 10 it comes out the SAME shoot. It wasn't worth the money that someone spent and I'd have returned it for something else, had I not thrown out the box and had a receipt."
2,"If you call ""screaming because you're stuck"" ""FUN""...","I got this for my twins when they were 9 months old. It was out of the house just after they turned one. Both of my twins at one time or another would get their hand caught in this toy! I haven't seen anyone else write a review about this happening, so I wanted to warn a few people. In the top part, if the child drops the ball and then decides to ""get it back"" by putting their hand and arm down the hole, they get caught. I thought it was a poor design. I was always right with my kids and saw them do this. Also, my kids loved to lay on top of the toy (on their tummy). This made the toy very unstable and ""teetery"", one of my twins fell once. This was an excellent toy to encourage them to ""stand up"", but after they learned that, I had these two complaints."
4,POOR PRODUCT (SAFETY ISSUE),This product is designed for encouraging the child to pull up and play activities. When a child pulls up on the steering wheel like top the top can come loose thus the child falls down. Also when pulling up the base is not wide enough for support and the unit topples over and thus the child gets frighten and possibly hurt by the fall.
4,Great toy beyond learning to stand...,"We got this for our daughter for her 1 year birthday to help her learn to stand, and she had so much fun. She still plays with it even though now she can run. We lost the balls to it and that was a bummer, but the kids still love to drop other toys down it and make it play music. It's still a fun toy in our house."
4,Lots Of Fun !!! (after u get the horrible thing together),the kids find this to be a very entertaining toy. so do any little ones that come to visit. but if you have a hard time putting things together you may want to look elsewhere / or get someone else to put it together for you (someone with patience).;>)
4,Great fun but not very sturdy,"My 8 1/2 month son loves this toy, but we have to sit and hold him, it is not sturdy enough for him to pull up on or to stand holding onto without help for long periods of time. I thought he would be able to do that when we bought it, but its actually quite tippy. That said, its still one of his favorites."
4,fun,This toy is good. My girl learned her colors and had fun doin it. She loved the music as she learned to put the balls through the slots and watch them go down adn out. Good toy!
1,Disappointed with Fisher-Price,"This toy is advertised to help your child learn to stand. It is very unstable for a child learning to stand. Once your child can stand, they seem to enjoy it. It is not as well made as you would expect, very light weight for a toy advertised to help your child stand. It falls over with the slightest weight applied. I was very displeased with the amount of pieces to put together and the quality of this paticular item."
1,not a good investment for kids under 2,my son is 1 1/2 and this thing [disappoints]. I was so excited to get it and then his arm kept getting stuck and he never played with it. he had the crawl and cruise to and he didnt care for that either although i would give that 5 stars its a great toy. but this one is a waist of money and could cost you a trip to the hospital.
2,not for little guys,my son is 20 months and the first couple of times he put the ball in he went after it through the hole in the top and got his arm stuck and almost broke it.
1,Little Arms Get Stuck!,This toy is dangerous. My daughter tries to retrieve the ball from the center section and gets her arm stuck. It makes her cry and she gets scraped. I called fisher price and they told me to send it back for a refund. They should stop selling this product!
1,NOT SAFE FOR PULLING UP,My son has learned how to pull-up so I figured with the name of this toy that he would really enjoy it. The first time he played with it he tried to stand up and the whole toy tipped over on him. It scared him so much that now he cries when I try to get him to play with it. I would definatley not recommend this toy as it is not stable enough.
2,Not so impressed,"Far from being award-winning, this is one of the most disappointing toys my 14 month-old daughter received for Christmas. It took us longer to assemble the parts than she actually played with it. She did enjoy dancing to the music, but gave up putting the balls down as they don't come out the bottom! She tried putting her hand down the center to remove them and only got her hand stuck. The whole unit is unstable and the top comes off too easily leaving sharp edges exposed. It took my daughter two minutes to figure out how the toy worked and then looked up at us as if to say ""now what?"" Not impressed."
2,is it me?,"We bought this toy for our daughter for christmas. she loved it in the box - would sit and play for hours. when we took it out and put it together, it went downhill. The spriral slide didnt lock together very tightly and the balls got stuck every single time. we took this product back to the store for a refund!!"
3,It worries mom!,my daughter loves this toy. she'll put ANYTHING she can down the hole including herself. Every time she plays with it she gets her arm (stuck)in the big hole all the way past her elbow. She can't get it out and thus begins her screaming fit. We kept thinking she'd learn how to get her arm out but finally just took it away from her.
2,One Of Those Regreted Purchases!,"I purchased this item for my 17 month old daughter, who at first was amused by the music and lights... but could care less about the balls. She played with the music button off and on for a few days, but basically ignored the toy since I bought it three months ago. I have since decided to donate the toy, since it has barely been used and may bring joy to another child. I guess the pleasure depends on the individual child. Apparently some like it and some don't. I would not however recommend this toy."
2,More Plastic Junk,"I bought this toy in hopes of encouraging my 9-month-old daughter to start pulling up & standing, as her pediatrician was concerned about her development being delayed. I certainly should not have wasted the money on this product. There is NO way that a child of ANY size would be able to pull up on this toy without toppling it. Therefore, it provides an unsafe temptation which is likely to result in discouraging pulling up when the baby ends up falling backwards with this toy on top of her! What's more, the sounds and music are annoying. The only redeemable feature of this toy is the colored plastic balls, which she enjoys putting into various buckets, bowls, and boxes that she has."
4,Not all that it seems!,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 9 months old, because he was learning to pull himself up and that was what the toy advertised. We have hardwood floors, and every time he would try to pull himself up, the toy was so top heavy that it would cause him to fall backwards. This toy requires constant supervision! Please be VERY careful if you are purchasing this toy as a ""pull-up"" toy, it really needs to be renamed because the title is very misleading."
4,great toy!,my daughter (7 months) loves the balls that it comes with. they are really bright and catch her eyes very well. she is slowly getting the idea to put the balls in the holes. she loves to hit the face on the top to make the music go so she can dance to it. the only thing that bothers my daughter is when the balls go up inside the toy and don't come back down...not a big deal at all though. over all...i think this is a great product and lots of fun for babies.
3,It's ok,We bought this toy for our son's first birthday and he plays with it a little but it hasn't been that exciting for him. Plus we had a problem with balls getting stuck half way down and ended up taping the ramp down.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be....,"How can my son learn to stand up by himself when the darn toy tips over every time. This is a great cat toy, but not very good when your little one is learning to stand up."
4,great toy but tips over,"My son started playing with this toy at 6 months and still plays with it every so often and he is almost 3 years old. I think this is a very fun toy except when he was first learning to stand up, it would tip over on him. Solution, put one of the legs under the couch for support in holding it."
3,Not what I thought...,Even though it is a neat toy to put the ball in and anticipate where it comes out with cute music... I was quite disappointed that when my son tried to pull himself up on it he always fell over with the toy on top of him! I thought this was funny since on the front of the box they show a baby pulling up on it.Not all that we thought it should be...
2,Not as sturdy as it should be.,"I purchased this for my then 6 month old daughter, but upon further inspection decided that the cruise and crawl playground would be more appropriate. It seems more sturdy and has more activities to extend its useful life, and the price difference is not that great."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought it, took it home, put it together, and then the ultimate test...... my kids! My youngest son (9 months) tried to pull himself up on the toy and it did NOT support his weight (17lbs.). He also could not hold onto and walk around the toy at the same time because the base sticks out too far. He liked putting the balls in and making the music turn on (when the toy felt like it). Also, the balls would not roll all the way down. They kept getting stuck and the slide kept coming undone. Not happy with the toy at all. Has only one function.... putting balls down the chute. Recommend the the Fisher-Price Crawl & Cruise Playground. (See my review in its description page) It may cost more but well worth it. Do not buy the Stand-Up Ball Blast. Thank You."
4,This is a great toy,"I bought this for my son when he was 6 months old, even though it is rated for 9 months and up. At first he didn't pay much attention to it, but as the months passed, he started to play with it. He is now almost a year old and this remains one of his favorite toys. He used it to help him pull up, after he had gotten the hang of pulling up on the furniture. He no longer needs help getting up, but he still enjoys putting the balls into the various openings to hear music and see the lights flash. He's even figured out that if the ball isn't right below him to look on the other side. He's had hours of fun with this one! My 4 year old daughter like the music, too."
1,A fun engaging toy,"We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. At first she didn't play to much with it and it is just recently (at 16 months) that she really seems to have gotten ""into"" this toy. She spends a lot of time each day pushing the balls down the shoot, pushing the blue smiley button on top that makes music, and in general just hanging all over it. It has been a good buy."
5,A fantastic toy for your little one!,"My daughter received this toy for the holidays when she was 7.5 months old. She was an early ""stander"", so she loved it from day one. This is definitely one of her favorite toys (she's now 10.5 months) and it has held up to daily playing extremely well. Sometimes, she just carries one of the balls around with her (she seems to prefer the blue one); she enjoys the music when she puts the balls through and dances while holding on. She also experiments with different items, putting them through the holes (or not, depending on the size). She discovered that her binky didn't roll very well. And other items don't necessarily fit. Great for learning size and shape! I highly recommend this toy!!"
2,Should be a recall !!!,Anyone who gave this toy an A+ obviously didn't get this toy for a child learning to stand. A pull up toy is what is advertised as. Well it's not weighted enough. My 8 1/2 month old daughter tried to pull up on this on it tipped over on her. She's only 17 lbs. so you know it'll tip over for a heavier child. Have you ever comforted a child with tears running down her cheeks cause she banged her head on the floor or got hit in the face. Think of this when you think of buying this toy. Cause that's what you'll be doing!!!
3,Not sturdy!!!,"I bought this toy for my seven month old, but turned out to be a hit with my three year old!! It's really not sturdy enough for a baby learning to stand up. My only major problem is the balls don't usally go all the way down, they always seem to get stuck between the ramps. But otherwise it's entertaining."
3,It's just OK,"I got this toy for my son as a gift. He likes it. But when he wants to hold it and stand up. The toy is not durable enough to support him, which is why I rated this toy for 3 stars. My son likes the music from the toy and the flashlights that are great. I also don't think it has any educational purpose. I don't really feel that."
1,Uneducated author,"Anyone who writes a kosher, non-vegetarian cookbook where the only coupla desserts are dairy hasn't spent any time in a kosher home. I can look at any cookbook for gourmet recipes that don't contain ham or meat-and-cheese. The point of a kosher cookbook is that it meet the needs of a kosher lifestyle. Two thumbs down.I'll take anything from Gil Marks over most kosher cookbooks in a heartbeat:Encyclopedia of Jewish FoodOlive Trees and Honey: A Treasury of Vegetarian Recipes from Jewish Communities Around the World (Hardcover)"
3,"Useful Info, Dreadful Editing","There are nuggets of useful information in this book, but they are somewhat thinly scattered among a lot of very clumsy sentences, some of which don't parse at all. Whoever edited this (or didn't) did a real disservice to the author. If the subject is of value to you, get a used version soon (before the info goes out of date), and don't pay a lot for it, or you'll regret the expense.Also, I found it helpful to have some small Post-Its, to put tabs on the 30 or so pages with really useful information."
2,Lots of VERY basic information,"If you have spent any time with your GPS unit you will find little if any new information in here. A lot of the book covers the basics that you will already know... and there is a whole chapter devoted to how to take a screenshoot of your GPS screens. The chapter is just a lot of pictures of screens.There are snippets of useful information but they are far and few between. It is only because of these few snippets that I give it a two.Save your money, spend an hour online at a good GPS site and you will be further ahead."
2,Useless,"The book had absolutely nothing about the GPS I use. If you have one of the models written about, it might be useful, but if you have anything else, it's worthless."
1,Worthless book,Don't waste your money in this book. It covers subjects like how to install gps antenna in your house. Why would you want to do that??? All the information is available for free from better sources and more in deep.
3,hacking,The title is mesleading. I looked up the definition of Hacking to see if I was out of line. This title is misleading. My idea of Hacking is getting something for nothing by getting into a computerized system. You will not get anything for nothing from your GPS by reading this book. I do think this book is useful. It is a good read. There is a lot there that you will never use or need for the price.
2,Mediocre,"Two adjectives: minimal (which is not bad in itself) but completely aimlessEach song starts out with an interesting and high quality theme, but all except a couple of tracks go nowhere and leave the listener bored."
5,"Best of 2007: Equal parts Stars of the Lid, Hammock and movie score sound...","When I first picked up ""Copia"" by Eluvium, I wasn't immediately in love with it, but there was something about the sound in it that I could not remove myself from.Over time, the album has grown in me and I've found myself playing it endlessly without even noticing. If you are a fan of movie scores, you will love it. But so will you if you enjoy the music of Stars of the Lid or Hammock. It's not ambient, it's not new age, it's not drone music: it's all of the above at the same time.After giving it a few listens, it crept up to my list of best albums in 2007."
1,bad buy,"This item is called ""Silver Solder"" but is JUNK! It is not a good quality product!I would never buy it again or do buisiness with that company again!Alpha Metals #AM23945 8OZ .125 GP Silver Solder- THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME!!!"
4,Excellent material,"Dr. Jerry Newcombe, co-author of ""George Washington's Sacred Fire"" and long-time researcher for Dr. D. James Kennedy, nails down the tricky topic of eschatology in this fascinating book. Without judgement, he lays down the major Christian viewpoints and meticulously backs his writing with quote after quote from theologians and authors ranging from Hal Lindsay to R.C. Sproul. Postmillenialism, Amillenialism, Premillenialism, Chiliasm, Preterism... all are covered and defended by their proponents.If you're the typical ""Left Behind"" believer, some of the alternative viewpoints may shock you. As we near 2012, ""Coming Again"" is hard to beat as an end-of-the-world read - I've enjoyed revisiting my copy."
3,Looks nice,"From the picture of the cap, I thought it would be sturdier than it was. I was surprised to see that it came in an envelope rather than a box. Even though the cap is flimsy, it still looks nice."
4,Interesting To Say The Least,"I am a college student and was forced to read this book for one of my Political Science classes. I must give Ms. Derthick credit. She wrote a piece that was very informative and gave you an inside look at what politics is really about. It takes you from the careful court systems, to protective government agencies, to individuals begging for compensation. It was a thick read, very slow for most of my classmates to get through. I believe she was flawed in her view of litigation over legislation. She made it clear that we should pursue legislation over litigation, though when it came to legislation, it seemed like she had a ""How dare they do that"" attitude. All I have to say is that if you are a student that is required to read this book, hold on because you are in for a ride. I also hope you have a lot of free time because it will take you a little while to read and digest all the information this book has to offer."
2,defective unit.,"I received the unit and plugged everything in and it worked well! For about a month. Then one light appeared to only turn on 1/2 way, then both lights a week or so later. A couple days after that, the light would no longer turn on. When power was cycled, it started to turn on, then went off. I assume that the ballast blew out.I retrofitted an old coralife fixture I had and the bulbs just barely fit. The two 56 watt T5 bulbs lit the tank beautifully, though, while it worked.I will try to get a replacement and hopefully it will work better..."
1,Light Ballast,"Can't rate item, it is not the correct item for the Lite I have. The Ballast is to large to fit in my lite even though the manufacturer/company shows this product as the product that fit my Light ficture. It was returned."
5,"Sad, sad, gothic like story","I'm not going to sit here and tell you what the book is about. You should read it! It is that good! I will tell you some of its themes. Haves vs Have nots, incest, rape, murder, poverty, love, romance, all throwned into a presssure cooker titled ""La charca"" to create one of the most touching, poigant stories you will ever read. It has a lot of twist and turns which in the end left me completely blown away."
5,Almost Completes the Collection on CD,"Buddy Holly fans should have this CD. It contains 15 tracks not included on the Buddy Holly Collection CD and leaves only a dozen or so tracks not yet available on CD, mostly those found on the ""Giant"" and ""Holly In The Hills"" records. Most of the rest of the tracks are available on CD now from Amazon.com. I you haven't heard these tracks, you're in for a treat."
4,Nicely written page turner,"I had never heard of Frank DeFord. My father bought this book as a Christmas gift for my husband, thinking it would be about sports. I had no intention of reading it, but when you're home with the flu, what do you do? Well, you read for 7 hours straight because you can't stop. Even if the characters were a little bit two dimensional (not Nina and Hugh as much as Bucky and Constance), the story of love transcending lifetimes was intriguing and fresh. It has something for everyone--romance, action, mystery, mythology, history, spirited debate and religion. This is a love story above all, but it's a thinking person's love story.My biggest complaint is that we never got to find out who Hugh and Nina were in their past lives--though after what they went through, I can understand them not wanting to open that can of worms. This book will make you wonder if you have found your soul-mate, or if they are half a continent away."
4,good listen',"i don't actually own this album, but it does look rather good. maybe i should buy it. oh well, have a good day."
5,AMAZING PRODUCT,This oil is a godsend! Works amazing on dry skin even eczema on you and Baby! It also works amazing while in labor to help loosen area's up so you don't rip!
4,Katie's Choice,"History seems to be repeating itself when Katie finds herself pregnant. Her own mother, Daria, faced a similiar choice after a brief, passionate affair, and chose to keep her child- Katie herself. Now, Daria urges Katie to abort as the smart thing to do. Her decision to obey tears her world in two, haunting her and altering the way she deals with life. Sure that she herself was a mistake, guilty over killing her child, Katie feels that there is no hope for her- but friends who love her against the odds and despite all the barriers give her a chance to begin again with Christ.**** While most Christian novels are filled with nothing but ""good"" people who would never make the choices Katie did, this one takes the bold move to acknowledge that ""good"" people still sin. If the abortion figures are accurate, then there are millions of young women who could benefit from this book. ****"
4,Compelled to Buy,"I started with a sample on my Kindle and found myself compelled to buy so I could continue reading. I found myself drawn into Katie's needs as well as those of her mother, well before the big choice came that Katie had to make. I liked the fact that answers were presented through pain and time, and hope was given for restoration and forgiveness. This is a good fiction read for teenage girls that will promote thinking about abortion issues from all perspectives."
1,Skip this if you're not religious!,"A not-very-thinly-veiled ""message story""- just basically telling people not to have an abortion. Goes with the argument that a fetus is a child, etc... just ridiculous in my opinion, and very unrealistic. In my experience, when a woman makes the choice to end a pregnancy, it's because it is what's best, and that choice certainly doesn't haunt anyone I know who has had one... the book just doesn't ring true. Not to mention it just felt like another way for Christians to judge: through literature now. Oh, yippee, another forum for small-mindedness."
5,Fits my Eclipse tank,"I ordered this to replace a worn out bulb for my son's six gallon Marineland Eclipse tank. It fit perfectly, and the light quality is noticeably better than the tube that came with the tank. At this price, I shouldn't have waited until the old one burnt out before making the switch."
3,Not very big,"I thought it look a lot larger than it really is. But it's cute, and not very expensive, so it's pretty much just ok."
2,Not a fan.,I was so excited to think that this would work with my hand held tablet and phone. It does not work very well. You have to be extremely patient to want to use this at all.
2,Not worth it,I paid less money for another Hybrid Stylus and it works far better. I was looking forward to this one because it was slim and would fit well with my Nook and it doesn't work well at all.
3,Hoping something better comes along,"This book will confirm what you suspected: porn is pervasive and most men spend a lot of time looking at it. Otherwise the whole treatment of the subject is lacking in empathy or any real understanding, and the text is opinionated and moralistic when you least expect it, even when it is (unsuccessfully) trying not to be, making it an annoying read. I didn't think that a book on porn could take me so long to read through."
1,sex biased,"Have you noticed that where the gender of the reviewer is decernable, the pros are all women, and the cons all men? Porn is in the eye of the beholder. At one point in this book Ms Paul recomends ""Erotica"" over ""Pornography"". Tell me, just what is the difference? Isn't this arguement more, ""You should look at what turns ME on, not what turns YOU on""? If a man spends 18 hours a day looking at porn on the internet, yes he has a problem. If he spends 18 hours a day looking at pictures of FROGS on the internet, he ALSO has a problem."
1,"No Carnes, no way!","I picked this one up at the library. I'm in total agreement with the premise and need for the book. However in the area of adverse effects of a porn world the author made a grave error. She entirely omitted the research of Dr. Patrick Carnes, the pioneer of sex addiction studies. No Mark Laaser either. Sorry, any real discussion of the harm of porn must communicate Carne's conclusions."
3,Flawed analysis but correct conclusions,"The authors has selected skewed and unscientific data. She frequently shows her misunderstanding of human nature in general and men in particular. Like when she castigates men for using fantasy or when she suggests that all erotica leads to progressive degradation or violence. However the main idea of the book is undeniable. Porn is too accessable and too many men are spending too much time in unproductive activivities that appeal to man's lower nature.Although the remedies she suggests such as regulating internet usage with a credit card have some validity, she clearly does not know what will help. She has does a service to society by bringing this important issue to light. It will only get worse if we ignore it and it can lead us nowhere but downword."
4,Excellent,"Pamela Paul does an excellent job of providing insight into people who use porn, without passing too much judgment. She presents the evidence and lets you decide what the benefits/detriments of pornography are. The chapters are divided well, giving attention to everyone who is affected by porn and a porn culture."
1,Terrible!!!,"This book is full of Biases! Don't read it, or if you feel you must then check out Watching Sex by David Loftus. Covers many of the same issues, and explains why Pamela Paul doesn't know what she's talking about."
1,author forgets that limiting tobacco and alcohol use,Have certainly not reduced the demand for those items. If it can't for thopse items then it won't for porn. My suggestion to women and men who are disturbed by porn. Don't enter into a relationship with someone who likes it! Plain and simple porn like prostitution is a minority taste if real research is put forth. Most of the people I know who are into it are single and have no interest in ever having a relationship with anybody. Problem easily solved.
1,No stars: Quarantine -- this book,"I've read several of the books in this series, and was a real fan of the show, but I feel it's only fair to give warning about this one. It was so out of touch with the show and its viewers, it offended. The only way it *was* in keeping with the show, was that the 'science' was laughable--below the level of a grade-school child. The story dealt with curbing an epidemic, yet the author couldn't be bothered to check out basic facts about, say, DNA. And Maria is chided because a total stranger shows up with a claim on her, pushes his way into her home (in the absence of her mother) and stays, and she doesn't bow and show him hospitality. This was so appalling, I actually tossed it in the trash after I read it, instead of donating it to the library. Didn't want the infection to spread."
4,one of the best uk garage artists,all i can say is listen to the bonus track - r u ready. there is crisp and mellow lyrics from Lifford as a guest vocalist on 'Please don't turn me on' and the garage mix is even better. A worthy purchase for uk garage fans.
4,Drills that can be used to correct mistakes,"I use this book to come up with drills that will help correct mistakes that happen durring the games. I look for technique specific drills(overlap, cross) and modify to my age group. There is enough options, that a coach shouldn't have a problem with team boredom. This is one of the books that is for the more advanced coaches that want to continue to learn."
3,Soccer Drills,"I thought there would be more unique individual drills that I could use for my instructional classes. Well, there were some, but most needed my modification because they just didn't make it stand alone. You see, the title made me think that these were drills that an instructor could use 1 v 1 for a single individual. Since it is well known that Deliberate Practice is the true key to success, not only in soccer, but almost any field of endeavor, I hoped for a compilation of those kind of individual drills. That's not really what was meant. You can't do most alone, or with just you and the player. OH WELL."
5,Great Watch!!!,"I love it! The only thing is that when you use the light, it's hard to see the digital part."
2,Fun but doesn't work right,"I bought this for my four sons. They all thougt it was very cool and it worked ok for a couple of days. Now the ferris wheel get's stuck all the time. It is also very noisy. I agree with the other reviewers that it is difficult to find cars that work with the ferris wheel. Most of the ones we have just fall off. This is a problem with many of these types of playsets (we also have the Cyborg set and it has the same issues)! Overall, pretty cool, but they need to work on some of the problems."
4,Good product with one drawback,"I did a lot of looking around for a durable track set for my son. First of all, this was a pleasure to put together (very easy). No decals to add! That was a plus. One of the other reviewers mentioned that their cars kept falling off the ferris wheel. That is happening to the one we purchased also. Heavier, longer vehicles have a hard time balancing on the ferris wheel. In the instructions it specicially mentions that some matchbox cars will not work properly with this set. Unfortunately, it does not mention which ones will work well. I am sure the ""Hero City"" line of cars will have a much better chance of holding onto the ferris wheel. Most of my son's cars are hot wheels and most have not been able to hold on very well. All in all, my son still finds this toy very fun. He also loved the DVD that comes with it."
1,Ferris Wheel Does NOT Work,"The cars continually fall off the ferris wheel, which is very upsetting to a child trying to play with this toy. I would not recommend it."
4,"So Far, 3 Days of Playing with Nothing Else",My son just got this for his 4th birthday and he has played with it non-stop for the past three days. He has found several cars that work with it and we have successfully connected his other matchbox sets to it for one large continuous track. Sure it is a little on the loud side and the ferris wheel does occassionaly get stuck but my 4 year old has discovered that all you have to do is switch it off for a second and then turn it back on to remedy the problem. It has even withstood my Golden Retriever tromping on it and chewing on it!
2,Built Great...But one BIG Problem!,"My 6 year old received this set. He was so excited. It went together very easily. It is also a very sturdy set. The problem is, it comes with a car that works great with the set, however most of my son's other cars (some are matchbox, some are hotwheels) won't go on the ferris wheel. My son spent a couple of hours trying out all of his cars and got frustrated. Now the set just sits on his bedroom floor."
1,Dissapointed with this toy,"I bought this for my 3 year old who loves anything to do with cars. It came with a DVD about Hero City, which he loves. However, one of the main characters, Bumper, doesnt even work on the ferris wheel. He has several cars from the DVD and all of them fall off of the ferris wheel before making it all the way around. They get stuck sometimes to the point where I have to help get them out. The catapault doesnt work for all of them either. I even got him a set of hero city cars to go with this and only one or two even worked. This is not worth the money, my son only gets frustrated when he plays with it because it rarely works."
4,Minimalism needs,You only get a few items that are useful for my needs but the items I can use are of OK quality.
5,Good read!,"Nora Roberts is a great writer with believable characters and situations. Love when she includes animals as characters, as well."
2,CHI Catonic Hydration Interlink Straight Guard,This product is really nice and the price is good. The only problem is the pump on the bottles was either poorly designed and either breaks or keeps coming apart.
4,CAIN AND ABEL!,'Black Irish' is a pretty straightforward film with believable performances by all. The tale of a lower class Irish family with more than its share of turmoil and sorrows keeps it's understated slice of dysfunctional life portrait realistic and heartbreaking. A little independent film that should not be missed.
2,just ok,"This was just ok, not that great. The father's acting was good. The bad brother's acting was good. Everyone else was kind of forget-able.."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I just know about this because my mom is a fan. I myself found her solutions to stress a little simplistic. I don't need to get a video to tell me to not treat life so seriously. I've been following her brilliant ""revelations"" for years w/out any help."
1,not too great,"I was taking this this for a while and all of a sudden when i go use the bathroom for number two, it was super hard to come out. I was in pain and my pee was lime green. So i don't know what's in it so i stopped taking it and i'm better afterwards."
5,Amazing turntable,"I am an amateur turntablist, and the Gemini TT04 were my first and let me say, if you just started or you're relatively new you're going to love these. Their not to expensive and not too cheap by any means. I've used more expensive Numark's, that dont even compare in quality to the Gemini's.With a 5gram tone arm, and a magnetic under plate im surprised they can sell these for less than $500. I definately suggest buying these if your relatively new to the art of turntablism"
3,better for fashionistas....,"A practical guide to choosing and caring for clothing, the secondhand way. However, it is geared more towards those seeking designer labels than those in search of vintage togs. Don't pass it up though, it teaches alot about quality and care."
4,On The Way,"This is quite a good album. It's got a nice mix of improv with composition. The best thing's are to follow in future releases, but this is the beginning of what makes Cheer-Accident the leader in the new jam/prog arena - true composition.Get this CD, as it's part of the linnage that brings you to the magnificent ""Fear Draws Misfortune."""
1,Using this Power Supply with a radio.,"I read the other reviews before I purchased this power supply. The one review stated that for Short Wave radio use, the power supply created significant interference, but for FM use it was probably fine. Most of our use is for FM, so I purchased the power supply. Locally, our town is considered to be ""radio free"". Our experience is that for ""the one"" strong local radio station reception overpowered the interference.For the rest of the stations there was significant interference. We've opted to not use the power supply when we are listening to the stationswe want to listen to. And, just decided to send the Power Supply back.The package clearly states in the first note ""Do not use this AC adaptor with a radio as it may cause some noises"". Information on web did not sufficiently declare this weakness."
3,Not suitable for radio use: a solution,"This Sony AC power adapter has the advantages of being energy efficient and universal with regard to AC input voltage. It does this by means of a switching power supply which generates rf interference, making it unsuitable for use with radios intended to receive weak signals. It is possible to locate a supplier of an ac adapter that does not use switching technology by doing an internet search for ""Sony ICF-SW7600GR ac adapter""."
2,Not recommended,"Had this air cleaner about 60 days. It quit rotating. Then after about another 30 days, it became so loud that we were not able to leave it on high during bedtime hours. Usually leave it on low so we don't have so much noise. Was not noisy at all in the beginning. Tried to make contact with manufacturer but never recieved call back."
4,Norell,"This is an old school fragrance. Charles Norell was a big time designer and the fragrance was developed by Revlon. My 90 year old Mom asked me to get her Norell, well it's not avilable at any department stores, the gals that work there never even heard of it. Five Star Fragrances still sells the stuff, thank god and it seems to be the same stuff thank goodness. I have had to buy popular fragrances and there about $50, so this bottle is a bargain at around $20. Thank you."
2,I like bad stuff,"This is horrible, but if you are into bad music the way I am then you will love it, and I certainly hope they continue so I can see where this leads."
3,"Strong, somewhat rushed first album","I have to admit not liking this album the first time I listened to it. After listening to a few songs individually instead of as an album I found they worked better on there own. I`m ok with that!The album has plenty of merit. It is valid music and I`m glad it`s been made. It`s just a little rough. I like the ideas presented but I feel more time should have been taken in production and excution.Anyway, too much pressure on musicians these days to come out with an album full of top twenty singles and the like.=$$$$$$ For Mr. Big. Booo on that. Let them find themselves and come into their own.I`d recommend to fans of Peaches, (maybe) Fannypack, Miss Kitten etc...Why not just check it out!"
5,Debut CD Is Power Pop Rock & Roll,"I heard about this band a while ago and had the opportunity to see them perform in NYC. I was impressed by the songs and looked forward to thier CD. I was not disappointed. The CD is loaded with well-crafted pop tunes, as well as more straight forward rock. Stand out tracks include Drown as well as Prom Queen, Life of the Party and Saturday. Many influences can be heard (Elvis Costello, Cheap Trick, The Beatles, Oasis, Green Day, etc), yet this band has a unique sound. Songs seem very familiar yet they are brand new. Over all I would say this a very good debut that I would recommend to anyone who likes good rock & roll or pop-rock & roll."
2,stage one of a long road of development,"The Good""Radio"" has a catchy chorus and memorable chord progression. ""Drown"" is an emotionally charged ballad with a decent chorus section. ""Any Place but Here"" has one of those sing-along sections that are sure to come back to you throughout the day. The heaviest riffs are delivered on ""This Girl,"" and it's probably the most melodic track as well.The BadVocalist Sal Scoca just doesn't have it. In the immortal words on the American Idol judges, he's just too ""pitchy."" The music is somewhat generic as well.The VerdictCore Records pride itself on producing bands the old fashioned way; molding and developing them over a number of years. With Crashbox's latest disc, it's obvious the band is at stage one of a long road of development."
2,"It's OK for math, but..","I had to buy another book for Language Art. On March, my son took the writing test but with this book, he couldn't prepare for it at all."
4,Multiplayer has its moments,This game can be very full-filling when it comes to multi-player battle and racing. as for solo play I find it enjoyable but I I have other games I would rather play.I recommend this game for multi-player but unless racing is your thing there are better games out there.
5,Camera mount Bracket,This is a great item at a very reasonable price. The ones at my local Micro center store were priced at $20.00 each or more
4,Itsa Flask!,"This seems like a pretty good flask. It's made well enough and I like that it doesn't have a cheaply made hindge for the lid. My last flask would leak from where the hindge was attached and it eventually fell off, so thats why I bought this one, hindgeless."
3,Just OK,"This knife is pretty average. I had high hopes that it would be as stellar as the 8"" chef's knife by Forschner, but it's very light and a little on the flimsy side. I've gone back to my Cutco paring knife that's 10 years old."
3,Great value,"Nice, sharp, but a little skimpy on the handle. There's not much to grip. I prefer a slightly bigger handle."
3,"Sharp blade, very tiny handle","This is a sharp little knife, and the emphasis should be in the little. I have other knives with similar blade lengths which much larger handels. At it's widest, the handle is about 1/4 of and inch. I have a henckles at a similar price point (J.A. Henckels International 3-Piece Paring Knife Set, Multicolored) that is 1/2 and inch, and my kyocera paring knife is shade under 3/4 of an inch wide. I never though handle width was important, but this knife is borderline too small for me to comfortably use. The blade itself is sharp and nice enough, and that's the most important part of a knife, so I'm still giving it three stars."
5,Best Knife Ever!,"I recently upgraded all my cooking knives to Forschner/Victorinox (nylon handles only). During this holiday season I've used every single one and two turkeys later, I won't buy anything else.As my daughter & I prepped and cooked she stated ""these knives are fantastic; I never knew a knife could slice so easy"". Don't tell her, but I'm gonna get her the block set for a gift in 2012."
4,Great value.,I ordered this knife based on the recommendations of COOKS ILLUSTRATED. I am very pleased w/ the quality of this knife. I would buy again.
2,mediocre,"I am a HUGE fan of the Forschner full size chef knives. They are well worth the money. this little knife though is $$$ thrown away. Invest in a forged paring knife like a Wusthof or similar. This did not hold its edge, dulled quickly, and was basically garbage."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this knife because we had bought one in Europe and left it behind when we moved to the US. It is exactly the same as the one we had in Europe (except the handle on that one was read) and works perfectly fine, nice and sharp right out of the packaging. We are loving it!"
5,Must-have!,"This is my most used knife now. I use it not only to pare fruits and vegetables, but also when I just want to chop up something small. It's a great little knife that fits perfectly in my hand and is convenient to use. I definitely recommend that everyone has one of these, they are just so handy!"
2,Too Small,I needed a paring knife and didn't pay attention to the dimensions in the listing. It's a Forschner and I knew it would be a sharp knife which it is. However the handle is way to small (diameter) for anyone with medium to large hands. It's certainly priced right.
3,Okay paring knife,"Somewhat flimsy, and a lot smaller than you think. Overall it cuts well, but seems they could have made it a bit stronger and charged another $1 or $2. Already seems to be worn out on the handle. Still at the price it beats most paring knives."
5,GREAT KNIFE,This knife is f**** awesome!! so sharp and cute and comfortable!!! slicing cucumbers and tomatoes is a pleasure!! like cutting through a cloud! get it! u won't regret
4,great little knife,my boyfriend bought me this knife (how funny is that! :)) and its a great practical addition to my kitchen.
2,Flimsy and cheap,"I have one of these knives from eight years ago. I just bought some recently as gifts and find they're not the same quality as they once were. The handles are smaller and thinner, and the blade is cheaply made, not the ""polished"" workmanship from years past. I've very disappointed with Victorinox for sacrificing quality for profit."
3,NOT SO GOOD,"SALTATIO MORTIS DID MUCH BETTER ON THEIR EARLIER STUFF ""TAVERNAKEL"" AND ""HEPTESSENZ"" THIS ONE IS TOO ELECTRIC AND TECHNO ."
4,Electric Knights,Mittelalterrock band Saltatio Mortis whips up a potent blend of medieval and modern sounds in this terrific album. My favorite tracks are Junges Blut and Licht und Schatten.
1,no t-shirt included,"Very disappointed. I try to avoid plastic as much as possible. This was supposed to come with an organic cotton baby t-shirt, but instead it came with a ""recycled"" reusable polyester (plastic) type bag. Not interested. Detracted from the rest of the products in the box."
3,"Good, not Great","I have liked nearly all of the Bob's Red Mill products I've tried so far. The Cornbread mix is good and better than most I've tried. However, the Gluten Free Pantry Yankee Cornbread mix is better... more moist and flavorful."
5,Wonderful Gluten Free mix,I love this Gluten Free Cornbread mix. Even people in my family who are not Gluten Free eaters love it.
2,The recipe clearly has way too little liquid,"I was excited to try the pre-made cornbread mix. However, when I made it using the recipe on the back of the packaging, there seemed to be WAY too little liquid. I could barely get them into the muffin pan, and then they just held their shape (didn't spread into the pan). It seemed to have a decent taste, aside from being dry. So I tried it again using a different recipe, and substituting the mix for the flour in the other recipe. That didn't work perfectly either. I have had much better results just doing it with a recipe and cornmeal."
1,Gross,Bad bitter taste and poor texture. My dog wasn't even excited about the scrap I gave him. I'll stick with Jiffy.
1,"Bland, dry","There wasn't anything I liked about this cornbread. It had a bitter taste and very little flavor. It was also very dry. The directions seemed a little fussy. All the ingredients had to be at room temperature. The pan had to be ""gray, nonstick."" I usually like Bob's Red Mill products, but I will not buy this cornbread again."
3,OK Corn Muffins but Plastic Packaging Often Defective,"The mix makes ok muffins if you increase the amount of milk to 2+ cups and slightly increase the amount of butter.The biggest problem I have encountered with this product is the packaging. On several occasions I ordered a box of 4 bags of mix and 1 or more of them had holes in the plastic and a lot of the mix was leaking out all over the place. Amazon was very good about replacing the unusable product, and last year I had email correspondence with Bob's Red Mill about the problem. They promised they would look into it but they have obviously not resolved it as the box I received yesterday again had leaking bags. The holes are at the bottoms and sides of the bags and not on the seams. A sharp object had apparently pierced them - could it be a manufacturing glitch or employee sabotage at the plant???"
4,Add more milk,"You will need to add more milk than called for on the package. I don't know why Bob's doesn't listen to its customers, and rework the instructions. You won't get a pourable batter because this is gluten free baking, but you will want to make it wetter and lighter. I think the product is improved by adding some extra gf cornmeal too."
3,"I like it, the kids don't.","Before becoming gf, we used the cornbread mix from the grocery store that comes in the little blue and white box and the kids loved it. They don't like this cornbread, but I do not mind it, I just hate throwing out what doesn't get eaten."
3,Where are all these good reviews coming from?,"Before going gluten free, I LOVED corn bread. Couldn't get enough of the stuff, it was a meal in itself.So to try something different and something that required little effort, I picked a package of Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Cornbread mix up from the store yesterday. While making the cornbread mix was simple enough and baking the mix was easy, this bread just doesn't taste good.For those so starved for a piece of corn bread this will be okay. It's consistency isn't terrible and it does taste like corn bread. Just not tasty cornbread I want another piece of.I found slathering the bread with butter helped.2.5 stars out of 5"
4,Pretty good.,"I like the jiffy cornbread mix better, but this is not to bad. I find the mix a little dry. So I add a little buttermilk (not too much), & some honey or brown sugar. Yum! I like this with bean soup of course, but also with boiled cabbage. Very good stuff! Highly recommend."
5,Great product,"I work in Milwaukie, OR - home of Bob's Red Mill, so I am very fortunate to be able to buy their products directly from the source, in bulk. As such, I have tried a lot of their items. This is my favorite Bob's product by far. It tastes exactly like regular cornbread, which is awesome. You honestly cannot even tell you're eating a gluten free product. I like to add jalapenos to mine. Definitely give this mix a try, it's a very impressive GF product."
4,Gluten Free at its best,Finding products that are gluten free that are good enough to satisfy the non-gluten free crowd is tough. This product was a hit with all and very well received. The texture and quality was not sacrificed at all in the product and made excellent cornbread that nobody new was gluten free.
5,cornbread mix,once again great availabilty and easy on the pocket book and the service as always is top drawer. Service and price that I have become accustomed to. Thanks
5,VERSATILE and TASTY,"This is delicious! I use it for cornbread, or as topping for tamale pie, or as dumplings in chicken stew. My whole family loves it, even if they are not GF."
3,BOOM,"A very stylish movie featuring some big names from bollywood like Amitabh, Jackie and hot ones like Katrina Kaif and Padma Lakshmi. Good and fast paced movie."
1,Works OK,"This Hayden fan control arrived in a nicely sealed package, missing the parts kit that was supposed to be included, and with the wrong instructions for this unit.Since I'm a ""car guy"", and an electronic engineer, I installed it with no real problems. Seems to work OK, would have been nice to have the parts kit and correct info/instructions.UPDATE: UNIT HAS FAILED AFTER THREE WEEKS USAGE !"
1,Broke,I bought this fan control and installed it in my 98 pathfinder. I was doing a transmission flush at my shop so I had the car running but was not in it about ten days later. Once the trans flush was finished I shut the suv off and heard my coolant bubbling so I looked at the temperature and the suv was overheating. After about a half hour of screwing with the stupid hayden fan control I figured out that it was broke! Only ten days old! Now I am waiting on a replacement but it better last longer! IT ALMOST COST ME AN ENGINE!
1,died after 6 days,"wired up the controller per instructions. worked perfect, no problems. this is on a 95 impala SS to control the factory fans, which this controller is claimed it can do. 6 days later(about 200 miles) i pull into the store and my coolant is overflowing/steaming. the fans were not on. i pulled the relay to see if it had failed and the fan controller was melted and smoking. way to make a quality product hayden. i'll never use your stuff again"
1,"Worked, not so much now",So this worked for almost a year. Not so much now. There is nothing like being stranded because a manufacturer can't seal there electronics and there connectors rust. I pulled out the resistor and the connections where rusted. Cleaned the connections still won't work.
2,roll the dice,"i bought three of these kits for three ford trucks. two of them are still working great but the one i put in my truck failed rather quickly and i didnt bother with a warranty claim, might have been a freak thing."
1,Worked fine... for a while,"I installed this to control a Hayden e-fan on my Ranger when the fan clutch gave out. It worked fine for quite a while, but one fine day I turned off the truck and took the key out... it kept running! As odd as this was, I popped the hood and found the culprit, it was this creature here! The relay or electronics contained within had fused and was backfeeding electricity into the vehicle. This caused the Engine Control Diode do melt and weld itself into my fuse panel. It didn't kill my truck, but it easily could have!"
3,"Bassinets Disappointed, But Playard is Great","Like other reviewers have noted, the board caved in the center when using the bassinets (enough so that my twins rolled to the center). We thought it was too dangerous to use the bassinet portion and ended up buying two separate bassinets. That said, we didn't return the item because having an extra large playard has been great (and will continue to be great), so I recommend the product only as a playard."
4,sagging middle,"It really is a great product, the only problem is that there isn't enough support under the bassinet. I found that our girls always rolled to the center, we had to put a small ottoman in the play yard to keep the mattress level."
3,Just Ok - Mattress caves in the middle,"I ordered this for my twins thinking it would be a safe way to keep them together, but separate just home from the hospital. The concept is great and the item was just okay...the problem I have with it is that the mattress caves in the middle so the right side of the left bassinet and the left side of the right bassinett dip down and does not seem totally safe since you either have to lay the babies on the part that is ""up"" or the part that is caved in. Definitely not worth the price with this flaw! Would not reccommend but there arent many other twin bassinet pack n plays out there that I have seen!"
1,Major Dangerous Flaw,"This would otherwise be a great item, but the fact that the folding mattress caves in and does not lie flat under the bassinets makes for a potentially disastrous situation. With current knowledge of SIDS you'd think that Graco would be more aware of this. The babies can roll towards the middle because of this flaw and possibly suffocate."
3,Skip it,"Unless you plan to travel with them when they are tiny or need a daily nap spot other than their cribs this isn't necessary or worth it. You can't just use the top part without the bassinets as one big space - it might have been useful a little longer if it could have. It doesn't work very well for changing diapers because of the bassinets.Also regular pnp sheets don't fit this and I've yet to see sheets for this in a store (so get them on here when you do buy it).I think you would be better just going ahead and getting two basic pnp for traveling. They are going to outgrow the weight limit of the bassinets quickly and they are going to want their own space. When we took our first trip with them at 6 months we had to borrow two pnpbecause they couldn't sleep together without waking each other up.Mine is by my door as a holding spot to get them in and out of the car/house when I'm alone. For that it's been useful, but no more so than a regular PNP."
4,Best tasting animal crackers,"I bought a case of these for an animal-themed birthday party a few years ago, but have kept buying them since. At first I thought it made sense to keep buying animal cracker ""cookies"" since they are reasonably healthy for both mom (just 2 Weight Watchers points per serving!) and kids. But the brands at Safeway all tasted stale and artificial compared to the Austin. Since Safeway doesn't carry this brand, I just keep buying the cases at Amazon. Easy to toss a bag in with the sippy cup for snack time, or to keep a few bags stashed in the car."
4,Real Life Threats,"This book was hard to put down. A must read for anyone who wants to know what REALLY happens outhere in the real world. You always think it happens to someone else, until you are someone else. It sheds light on the truth. You only hear the horror stories about guns. Not how they save countless lives. Keep in mind responsible gun use must be practiced. None the less you shouldn't be discouraged from owning a firearm for self-protection. This book gives you a view of what has happened to ordinary people, just like you and me. It doesn't tell of every circumstance possible, but does shed light on what happens in the real world. It was worth the reasonible price aked."
5,BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR,"Kevon Edmond's new release is pure joy. From beginning to end, his voice lifts my spirits and you can feel his emotions and strength in his song. Bravo!"
5,EXCELLENT FROM BEGINNING TO END,"There isn't much more I can say that the others have not already said. I must admit I did not expect to like it, but I'm glad I was mistaken. It is an EXCELLENT R&B CD. If you are a fan don't hesitate - Get It!"
4,"Great CD, Wish I Could Say That about His New CD, Who Knew","This is one of my flav CD. Listening to it right now, just love it. His latest CD Who Knew, which left a lot to be desire. I think because BabyFace produced and did a lot of the writting on this CD, its just the best... I would buy this CD over Who Knew CD anyday of the week.."
5,Kevon Edmonds is OFF THE HEEZY FO SHEEZY!!!!!,"This album is the best album of all time!! Kevon Edmonds formerly of hit group ""After7"" has just realeased the new cd ""24/7"" and it is awsome!!! He gets some collaboration from brother Babyface, but Kevon proves he is a force and vocalist to be reckoned with!! You can feel every song! This album is nothing more than absolutely Fantastic!!! Go get it NOW!!!!!!!!1"
3,half glass,"to be a honest critic, this is my opinion of 24/7-first of allkevon edmonds has a beautiful voice...more beautiful than his brobabyface...he also puts a lot of feelings and emotions in his singing. a few of the songs were boring and put me to sleep, but 'no love' and 'sensitive mood' were so touching that they made me cry. 'no love' is a good song to if you need comfort and company in your misery...like after a breakup. Overall if you like ballads you will love this cd. he really does have more power in his voice than 'face'"
5,croon (kroon) v. 1. to deliver a song like Kevon Edmonds,"Kevon Edmonds has an amazing voice and from the first note of the first cut, I knew I'd made a wise purchase. When Kevon Edmonds tells you, ""He'll never love you, not like I love you,"" I'm sure any woman is convinced of just that. Kevon is at his best when crooning ballads and his first tenor range delivers them beautifully. His debut effort is on the mark. Tracks one and two provide a strong opening, but each arrangement is tight. 'No love,' and 'How Often,' are among my personal favorites, but each track follows the previous perfectly. There is something about his phrasing, his runs, that has always reminded me a little of Whitney Houston--moreso than reminding me of his equally talented brother. His vocals are powerful and full of emotion. He has always had excellent control of the pipes, seemingly getting better and better with each project. This project is sure to do well and I hope that Kevon will be around crooning for years to come."
5,Fresh Style,"Kevon Edmonds' CD is really good. It is very relaxing and I feel that his style is unique. My favorite song overall is ""When I'm With You"". The song moves me. ""Sensitive Mood"" is a good song for those who long for their S.O. to be near. I strongly recommend his CD."
5,Excellent,"Oh, this CD jams! Every song is great. From the moving 24/7 to the ""take the top down from the convertible""-Love will be waiting, this album is packed with clear lyrics and impressive feelings throughout. This is the album to take when you've got to drive long trips- Your distance will be cut short in no time! Buy this CD!"
4,Awesome solo debut,"Being a big fan of After 7, I knew that I would love Kevon Edmonds solo effort. Amazingly though, when I first got it, I didn't like it at all! After a couple of weeks though, I thought I'd give the cd another try and now I love the cd. Tracks 1-7 are off the hook and although in my opinion the album kinda drops after that, overall the album is a definite keeper."
5,KEVON SHINES ON DEBUT !,"As former lead singer of the group After 7.. he steps out with a great debut.. This is one of the best debut albums in a while from an r&b artist.. Produced mainly by his big brother Kenneth ""BABYFACE"" Edmonds..Favorite cutsNever love you, 24/7, When I'm with you, A Girl like you, Sensitive Mood, great effort all around"
1,"Some Great Music, But Horrible Sound","This is a disgrace. A collection of many hip-hop greats doing some previously unreleased stuff (Ice-T, for one), and a fairly dope mix it is. However, the sound quality is absolutely dreadful, at times unlistenable. Some tracks sound actually warped (treble and bass fading up and down). K-Tel Records used to sound better than this!!What a shame! As well, some tracks are mislabeled (Ice-T does NOT appear on track 2, Coolio does!) and others are horribly butchered (Ice-T's ""Play It On"" with Smooth The Hustler is not only the WORST sounding track on the CD - shame, it's a fly track - but it's also censored to the point that nothing is understandable!!!). What a letdown. Put this stuff out correct!Until then: avoid, avoid, avoid."
3,Ad is misleading...,"Just got this in today and I already notice 2 problems...First, the ad states that the bike mounting clip is included and it is not. As this was the primary reason for me getting this, it's a bit of an inconvenience.Second, Mac users should note that no where in the ad does it state that you can't use Garmin software with the Mac OS. You'll need to get Virtual PC and Windows XP to use their software."
3,don't buy the Vista Cx for its barometric altimeter,"When GPS were first introduced we used to joke about the inaccuracy of their satellite determined elevations. I bought the Vista Cx because I thought the built-in barometric altimeter would reduce the problem with satellite determined elevations - it does not. The expected error in elevation is 50 to 200 feet, far worse than the positional accuracy of the gps. To reduce error Garmin recommends calibrating the unit every hour to a known elevation - if you know the elevation that well you don't need a gps! So, while you marvel at the positional accuracy of the unit you can still expect to get a good laugh from the elevations."
4,"Very good receiver, but a few facilities are lacking","I don't have any complaint in terms of the receiver itself. It works just fine, quickly finding the satellites. The screen is bright, easy to read, buttons are well placed, navigation along menus and functions is OK. I haven't used it on long trips, but battery life seems to be more than adequate.What I miss is a better base map, not living in the US. Documentation, when it comes to details of how tracks and routes differ, and how to deal with waypoints and viapoints is of no help. The software that comes with the unit is lame. Fortunately several free alternatives are available like GPS Trackmaker and GPS Babel. Also, Google Earth can send and receive data to the receiver."
2,Mac Users Beware,"The Vista CX is a very nice GPS with great features EXCEPT the map software is not Mac OS compatable. You cannot upload maps or use any features which benfit from creation on computer based detailed maps. You can purchase the Garmin memory cards with map info and then establish waypoints etc., on the unit itself, but forget about the full functionality of planning, and mapping points and then uploading to the unit. The Garmin technical rep I talked with said Garmin is working on Mac compatability but would not indicate if this was one month, one year, or longer before reaching the market. The third party maps compatable with Macs I have found, so far, for planning trips, etc., such as National Geographic Maps, cannot be uploaded to the Garmin unit."
3,Refurbished had to be sent back and replaced,The Garmin eTrex Vista CX Color handheld works great EXCEPT that it will not power on without taking the batteries in and out each time you turn it on. It was a reburbished one with a year's warranty from Garmin. Seller told us to return it to Garmin. Garmin has given great service and we are supposed to get a replacement in a week's time.
4,Garmin eTrex Vista CX Color Handheld GPS,"This is a great little handheld GPS for hiking and geocaching. Has a micro SD card expansion slot which is perfect for upgrading the maps and using the eTrex as a USB flash drive. I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because it does lack on the getting satellite locks while inside buildings and loses satellite reception if you put it in a pocket. Other than that, if you are in the open or hiking through the trees, this is a perfect inexpensive GPS for hiking and geocaching."
1,Just Didn't Work,I purchased this for geocaching. When I tried connecting to a computer it just wouldn't work. Tried several machines. Same result. So I just sent it back to Amazon. I have experience with another Garmin unit and loved it so I'll try getting another model. Maybe this was just a lemon.
4,Great hand held unit,This unit takes a while to acquire satellites but then it's a wonder. It does all you can ask of it. The only major drawback is that Garmin charges for each additional map set that you may want.
2,Might not be the best GPS system,"Product worked fine and was relatively straightforward to setup. Features work as advertised although initial time required to lock onto satellites seems overly long. My primary issue is with the additional maps that are required - you need to buy both topographic and road maps [at about $100 a pop] if you plan to use offroad and on-road. Plus the topo maps are over 20 years out-of-date for my town making me wonder if they have any accuracy or relevancy at all. In retrospect, I wish I had looked more closely at the Delorme Earthmate GPS PN-20 as it comes bundled with map software that promises both up-to-date coverage of both topo and roads."
2,Frustrating Item,"The first Vista Cx I purchased died after only 3 days of use. I returned it to Amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it. The second unit lasted for 4 days until I fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket. Though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen. Garmin's claim of waterproofness for 1m for 10 minutes is utter baloney. The poorly designed T-style lock on the battery case cannot possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity. I probably wouldn't buy buy another Garmin but I'm stuck with them as I have already invested $200 in proprietary MapSource software. I guess that was their plan.On the plus side, the Vista Cx did seem to function as it should...for all of 7 days."
3,Not for Macs--yet,"A cautionary note for Mac users, the GPS is great, but all of the touted MapSource charts and connectivity is for Windows users only. I gave the GPS to my husband for Christmas, and he was so dissappointed when he slipped the CD into our computer he hasn't even looked at it again. He'd hoped to use it to chart kayak routes on the computer before making trips."
4,Avoid Magellan at all costs.....buy Garmin,"I foolishly bought a Magellan Explorist 500. Let's just say the best thing about the experience is that Amazon's return service is absolutely first rate. I was even stupid enough to replace my original malfunctioning Magellan with another, before returning that one too on the grounds that it was impossible to work with and didn't sync with my PC.The Garmin on the other hand - I had learned more about what a GPS is supposed to do in one hour with this unit, compared to three weeks with the Magellan. Very user friendly, very intuitive....restored my faith in handheld GPS systems."
2,Recevied with problem on the ON/OFF switch,"I recevied the device in good packing kondtion but, when i switch it on and switch it back off i can not restart the device back antel i renstall the battery again. is there and way i can send you back the device for repair or replecment?please advice"
4,Repackaged item,"The unit I received from Amazon quit working just before the 30 day return period. I left on vacation just after it arrived and didn't really start to use it until I got back. I ultimately ended up getting a new unit direct from Garmin.My main reason in noting this is that the first unit arrived obviously having been opened previously (light dust on the rubberized grip; user manual creased, etc.) While I understand that people return products and vendors need to try and resell them, I wish they would identify them as such. I suspect this unit got returned because it was acting erratic, but it was missed or ignored by Amazon. Basically I think the Garmin GPS unit is fine; I'm just annoyed with Amazon."
2,Average at Best,"I ordered this radio based on the favorable reviews. Unfortunately, I am not very satisfied with the unit. AM reception as noted, is terrible, but even when you CAN get a station well, the sound is fuzzy and muffled. On FM, the stations are clear, but the sound is....OK. Not really the deal I was looking for, but the cabinet and radio are attractive."
2,"big price, little book","***Buyer beware***This book (and the others in the series) sells for under $5 in JoAnne's. Amazon is ripping you off at $10. Know why it's so cheap? It's only about 30 pages, and much of the book is advertising for their products.OK, it does have some good information and helpful photos, and you can learn how to do some tricky stuff with it, but don't assume the price is right at Amazon."
2,"Performs well, but quality issue?","I am a semi-avid player; I play for an hour three times a week over lunch at work with a few competitive players. I have used Butterfly 3-star balls many times before without a problem (always supplied by one of the other players). It was my turn to get some balls so I bought the six pack via amazon. So far we have used 3 of the balls (the third only being put into play this week). The first two didn't last very long. Usually each of the balls last through 3-4 weeks of play before they crack or wear thin. The first two from the ones I bought never made it a week, one only making it one day. I suppose it could be a coincidence but their longevity has been a disappointment. Perhaps they were old or mis-stored."
2,Dry rotted,"I play a few times a week at college, I'll be honest we play pretty intense, but after around 3 hours of play time the balls crack along the seam, they work ok once cracked but after one good slam they crack to the point of being trashed. Once broke they break into pieces as if they were dry rotted, I've had far better experience with butterfly, maybe my order was just sitting In a warehouse too long."
4,How Durable ?,I bought 6 pack Butterfly 3-star balls. I used one of them and it had no uneven bounce and had a clean finish. I play TT with a group of guys who love to smash this ball as hard as they can. It lasted not more than 15 games (21 point game) or 3 days. I do know that some cheaper ones can last longer but they do have uneven bounce.I hope my review is some sort of benchmark to measure the durability.
1,Breaking after one match,I bought this item with high expectation because it is from butterfly. But it was a huge disappointment. It is breaking after one or two matches. I would expect much more quality than this
1,"Not Comedy, Just Mockery","It's difficult to like a movie which spends all of its time mocking others. Latter-day scriptures decry the practice of mocking your fellow beings. On the other hand, maybe I'm naive to take the scriptures seriously. Or to actually try to live them. Why not be a little bit like the world? Why not compromise values?I think this movie could have been written by grade school kids; it takes no talent, character, or smarts to make fun of someone the way Will Swensen does."
2,Moderately worth watching,"I'm glad I got this from the library. If I would have paid a rental fee for this I would have been annoyed and if it would have plopped down $20 bucks to buy it I would be kicking myself.The movie is not awful, it is easily watchable and moderately entertaining for about thirty minutes or so but by the time it is finished you will be thankful.Most of the jokes fall flat and I don't think there is any part of the movie where you will laugh out loud; there are a few moderate chuckles but nothing more. Plus they regergetate some of the jokes over and over again, if I hear one more time ""I would like to turn the time over to Brother...."" that joke was moderately funy the first time.... by the 10th time it is not.Anyway, the film is much better and lot more enjoyable to watch than the horrible Hometeachers and the even worse Baptists at our Barbeque but not nearly as good as Singles Ward and RM.It might just be that the Mormon joke scene is getting a little old!"
2,not as helpful as I hoped,"If you're taking mechanical vibrations, I recommend getting out your advanced math, DE and University Physics books for help. I have all 3 of these from schaum's and found them to be WAY more help than this review guide."
4,Vibration of materials.,Schaum's Outline of Mechanical Vibrations.A great reference and refresher manual with loads of examples and an easy to read format. All I need now is spare time to really make it work.
3,Not quite what I expected!,Anyone who orders these should be aware - they are essentially COMIC BOOKS - NOT printed word books.They basically follow the movie dialogue with a few departures. I think the artwork could be better.
5,These are so versatile,"I love the Cristal D'Arques Lonchamp line of crystal!!! Have had glasses, etc for many years - 25+. They are stylish and pretty for everyday or special occasions AND they go through the dishwasher!I highly recommend this line of glassware!"
5,Excellent CD transcends genre boundaries,"The Streets, effectively rapper Mike Skinner's vehicle, come into their own on ""A Grand Don't Come for Free"". While Skinner's debut, ""Original Pirate Material"", got by on unique beats and Skinner's unusual delivery, ""A Grand Don't Come For Free"" works just as well on a song-by-song basis, but is also a surprisingly cohesive and moving concept album about relationships and friendship. The album tells the story of the beginning and end of a relationship, matched thematically by the loss and search for a thousand pounds. Sound dull?Quite simply, it isn't. Skinner's take on the mundane is both familiar and insightful. Highlights abound, from the humorous and catchy ""Could Well Be In"" to the heartbreaking (and only single) ""Dry Your Eyes"". Trying to characterize Skinner in a particular genre (hip-hop, garage, etc.) is useless - no CD in 2004 was as funny, melodic, or moving as ""A Grand Don't Come for Free"". No music lover should miss it."
4,Ain't that the truth,"Some of my friends really like it, some really don't. Good stories in the songs. I like it."
3,Absolutely Original,"I heard the song ""fit but you know it"" on the radio last year and the first thing I asked myself was: What the hell am I hearing? This sounds like nothing else I've ever heard before. A british rapper? The idea sounds hysterical in itself. I laughed even more when I found out it was just some guy by himself doing this. Mike Skinner sure does have a unique hip-hop beat. After I heard his stuff a few times and really listened to the lyrics I began to like it a little. I think it's great that he can make his stuff known here in the U.S. because it's something different from the norm. I haven't heard anything from the first album but I'll check it out to see how it compares to this one. Overall this isn't quite my taste, but I like it because I hear it and laugh a little bit. Skinner can speak true on things and his sound is completely his own and that is awesome. Really listen to it and then decide."
1,Weak - especially compared to OPM,"So, so disappointing. I stumbled across Original Pirate Material and was pleasantly surprised. I'm a beat freak, but, more than that, OPM was an orignal, tight album that you could nod your head to. It also actually had some sort of flow from one song to the next. None of which I can say about A Grand. Every song is all over the map (garage rock? trip hop? electronica?) and many are downright unlistenable. The vocals, choruses and hooks are juvenille, immature and very poorly done. Skinner's lyrics aren't half of what they were on OPM and -- this is the main drawback -- the beats, rhythms and melodies on this album are just wack. There isn't one song on this album that you can actually nod your head to. If you like your music to sound like a bad science experiment, then this album is for you."
2,Proof that Brits can't rap,"Some of the lyrics are funny and occasionally clever and I like the British slang, but the delivery, oh my god. No flow, no rhythm, the dude just talks in an incredibly annoying, whiny voice. And the backing tracks? The beats are less entertaining than listening to a dryer loaded with shoes. I'm afraid that Mike Skinner's rythmic sense doesn't lend itself very well to rap/hip hop. Almost all of the backing tracks are stiff and mechanical with no groove or syncopation. As with another reviewer, my initial reaction was to laugh out loud at the general awfulness of this steaming pile, but then I remembered I paid money for said pile and that killed some of the humor. This truly sucks in such novel and humorous ways that I'll give it two stars rather than one. It's just not my cuppa teenage chav crap."
1,A total disappointment,"I absolutely loved Original Pirate Material, so I was excited when I heard they had something new out. I read the reviews here on Amazon and thought I would give it a shot. What a disappointment this was. I picture them in front of their keyboard, hitting the drum and base button and just talking over it. All of the songs sounded alike, they just speeded up the beat or slowed it down. I am going to see them when they are here on Monday, but I am really not looking forward to it."
1,"Love It or Hate it, But If You're NOT between 12 and 16...","...then you have no excuse for liking this dreck. Mike Skinner has basically played himself. I loved OPM, it was wry, innovative, in your face, everything this album isn't. If you sit down and really listen to the lyrics, I mean really listen (it hurts to do so but I dare anyone who proclaims that this album solidifies The Streets as a major force in hip-hop to do so and then get back to me)then it becomes pretty obvious that a) Skinner is coasting from all the praise he got on the first album or b)the first album was some kind of fluke and the guy's a total dweeb. For some reason, despite my love of Original Pirate Material, I think it's more likely to be the latter than the former. One of the all-time worst albums ever. The guy who made the comment about nobody wanting to be seen or heard blasting this from their cars hit the nail on the head."
4,You just gonna know it...,Either you like it or you don't... it's not rap - it's UK garage... My ex-boyfriend from brighton introduced me to this album and we listened to it from start to finish... it's reflects beats and melody with out being too vulgar. the lyrics are incredible story telling and those who usually listen to eminem may not connect to the smart concept of the album... stands out to me to as a top album of the year - love get out of my house.
4,Something New and Different,"Unlike most of these other reviewers, this album is my first introduction to The Streets, and it's different than anything I've heard before. I'm really impressed by the complexity and diversity in this album. Do yourself a favor and don't just turn it on; sit down and listen to it. The story that develops through the songs is entertaining while at the same time pedestrian; disappointing, while also enlightening. I mean every one of those words as a compliment. Tracks 1, 2, 7, and 11 are the highlights to me, but every track is interesting and worth listening to. I'm sure the others will grow on me the more I listen to it. Do yourself a favor and check this out. It may not be for everyone, but for some this album will be the doorway into discovering all kinds of new music."
3,"OK, but definitely no OPM","While Original Pirate Material was incredible,I have to say that I was a bit taken back at Mike Skinner's presentation on his new album. Yes, I did think that it was interesting how the whole album is a story-and it somewhat makes you pay attention-but I felt that AGDCFF lacked the excitement that personified Original Pirate Material. Most of the tunes are laid back and darker in tone than OPM. Also, I think Mike went pseudo-American-commercial on a couple of tracks, particularly with the R and B backups. I still listen to OPM frequently, but I doubt I'll listen to AGDCFF as much. Bottom line: if you're a Streets fan, buy the album, as there are some gems on it (i.e. Fit But You Know It); but if you're expecting another OPM, you're being duped."
1,Fnak - this is bad.,"I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it3) Drop the ""my life sucks"" and ""everyone hates me"" tracks - whoops that is the entire album4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are doneAnyone want to buy a used CD?"
1,SERIOUS?,"Im sorry, but when did the world suddenly like listening to a man talking in a dull voice.But this is the new stuff, the hip, radical anti-grandma weapon. Yeah man, no more musicianship, no more singing coz thats 4 idiotz innit?Ok...I...am...deeply...frustrated...by...this...pile...of...wankery."
1,un-original garbage material,"There were rumors that the vaunted Mike Skinner stole the beats and music to make Original Pirate Material and upon listening to this just once I am convinced. This is absolute garbage. Whereas Original Pirate Material was groundbreaking, this record is misguided drivel that sounds like rubbish made on crap gear in somebodies outhouse in the south of Wales. The production is garbage, the rhymes and rap barely passable, and there isn't a true toon on it. Mike your fifteen minutes of fame are up!!!"
2,terrible lyrics,"""I'm not gonna f****n', just f****n' leave it all now'Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow ""That's a seriously third-grade lyric right there. Nothing like a hideously forced rhyme to break any sort of mood a song has developed."
2,"Mostly strained misfires, with one glaring exception","2 1/2A lot of this sounds bad. Bad production, bad lines, bad songs. Sure it is more creative then US hip hop but that inherently does not make it good. Usually this eccentric-by-way-of-complete-normalcy UK rapper seems too preoccupied with his urban wit and unattractive tunes to do what he does best. Because the thing is, it is obvious Skinner possesses talent when truly in his element. The first and last few tracks bookend this loose concept album with some authentic dignity, but only Blinded By The Light stands out as a true masterwork of contemporary rap. All of the elements Streets use with far less degree of impact fall perfectly into place on that fourth track, only hinting at what true focus in the studio could yield."
3,does not live up to original pirate material,"I absolutely loved original pirate material and was thrilled when i heard about skinner's next album. Unfortunately it was not half as good as i expected. The album was decent but did not come close to living up to the hype and was not the best that mike skinner is capable of. There was too much melody and i really didn't appreciate the general cheeriness of the album. i still like it, but it was pretty disapointing."
2,Not as good as the first,"My boyfriend and I won the first cd ""Original Pirate Material"" from a radio station and INSTANTLY loved it.So naturally, we were looking forward to The Streets coming out with ""A Grand Don't Come for Free.""Well, it's bad.It's badder than bad.The choruses arent catchy, or witty, and they go off-beat most of the time.. and his attempts at singing are terrible.If you want to listen to The Streets, buy their first album titled ""Original Pirate Material.""Dont buy this one."
4,Its not Original Pirate Material but still good,"Musically, this album is inferior to OPM but it is stil a very good album. The lyrics are awesome, they tell the story of a day in the life of Mike Skinner. Which could well be applied to any average joe from the middle class not just in England but everywhere else.Do not expect this to be exactly like OPM. It is a different album, all praises to Mike Skinner for coming up with another inventive record and not just relying on cloning OPM. If he had produced a similar copy of OPM then everybody would be complaining how he has just found a formula for a record and just replicated it for a new album. Skinner has created a new album with a different approach. Buy this album if you are a Streets fan or if you want to hear some very creative lyrics."
4,Cinematic Experience on Vinyl,"Are most people getting that this is a CONCEPT album? I see a few have mentioned it, but that's the way this record is supposed to unfold. Each song can function on it's own, but each works as an individual part of a cohesive story: loss of a grand, loss of love, everyday wins and losses, and by the end, it wraps up positvely and negatively (very creatively on ""Empty Cans"" I might ass) just like life, pal. By the end, you'll see why a grand doesn't come for free. Nothing's free anymore.Anyway - a few throw-aways (but all are important to the story) BUT highlights are many, ""Dry Your Eyes"" ""Fit But You Know It"" ""Could Well Be In"" the aforementioned ""Empty Cans"" the kick-off ""It Was Supposed To be so Easy""....if you'll get it, you'll get it. If you're annoyed by records that are *very* British and/or out of the ordinary, then avoid this."
4,Unique,"If you won't something else than gangsta this is perfect. The english accent, the view if english youth-life, it's all in Mike Skinner's direct, sometimes childlike, raps. Truly unique"
3,Interesting...,"When i first listened to this CD through a friend i was intrigued, after carefully listening and being open minded i found myself being bored. Overall its a decent CD but nothing overly special or unique."
4,"Funny, fresh, different","I like The Hardest Way album even better but A Grand is very good, too. Some songs made me laugh out loud and still I can't help but grin when I hear them. I appreciate it when an artist has a unique way of looking at everyday experiences and Mike certainly does that."
5,Imperfectly awesome,"This is listening to your best friend at the bar, getting drunk, laughing and sometimes teary-eyed, while the Jackson 5, the Jam and Madness play on the Jukebox. It's Dave and Ray nailing your day, Mark E taking the piss and LL coming clean and letting you know that (of course) he needs love. It doesn't get better than this, only different."
2,Grubbage!,"I have heard spoken word hip-hop before. Masta Killah of the Wu Tang Clan had a silky, almost evangelical touch to his non-rhymes. This album, however, sounds like a CD full of the guy from the title track of blur's 1994 release ""Parklife"" - its good for an intro track but not for a full album.Probably the only thing that saves this album from getting one-star by me is the fact that the beats are not awful and somewhat mask the monotonous droning on of Mr. Michael Skinner.Get this album if you want to hear an ordinary British guy talking over half-decent hip hop beats about life. Personally I'd rather hear my Grandpa tell WW2 stories."
1,You all must be insane .This is a joke right ?,"This is not rap or hip hop . This group is the biggest joke ive ever heard . I dont even know where to start ... ill try . The thing that made me laugh was this guy said ''gosh'' in one of his songs :D jolly gee gosh willckers !! . This may be some sort of new gentle hip hop or rap , maybe an album for 3 year olds but all this group did was this - they took the east coast formula for the most and just pushed crappy lyrics about anything . Theres nothing to this . maybe in the area this guy lives the rap sucks so bad that this is the best they have but my god this is a joke ? this has to be one of those humor cd's ?"
3,Un-original Pirate Material,"Before any of you label me what Mike would call a ""Geeza-Hayta"", let me point out that I love ""Original Pirate Material."" It's one of my favorite albums.But, Mike Skinner falls flat on his sophomore release. Almost music-free (and rhythm-free), he recites his lines in a boring monologue that fails to have the flow, cadence, or patter of his original release. While his lyrics are still clever- though not so much as they were on his debut- they fail to captivate, as he simply drones on. The humor is not nearly as present, either, so that when he does get a little more melodic (Empty Cans) he comes across as so mean-spirited or bitter that it's hard to empathize with him.The album's two main high points: the clever, TV-inspired lyrics of ""Could Well Be In,"" and the emotional and touching ""Dry Your Eyes."""
3,I think I'm going to fall over...,"This is a fun album, full of slapstick and self-deprecating wit, with the beats pulled jerkily to one side or another of their natural resting place. Surprisingly, for a second album following a successful debut, it's if anything less cocky and more vulnerable than Original Pirate Material. Life keeps dumping on Mike Skinner (or at least on the character he plays on the album)... but at least there's beer to go out and drink, and girls to look at in chip shops. Not quite as compelling as the first album, but pretty good nonetheless. And ""Fit but you know it"" still makes me smile. ""I think I'm going to... oh, bloody hell."""
2,OK to read for the first book,I read Mr. Pring's other book on trading. This book copies his other book almost verbatim. The CD in this book is just him reading sections of the book to you. I was very disappointed with this book. It is nothing as advertised.I would only recommend it if your very new to trading if not don't waste your money.
4,Very Good!,This is a very good book and i recommend this book for people who are really interested in trading. I am a beginner in trading and i have learnt alot from this book.Highly recommended.
2,Very poor presentation and the CD quality,"I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the presentation and the lack of in-depth explanations. I think I have wasted my money on this, one can find much better and more informative materials for free on the internet from different blogging sides. The material also seems to be outdated. I agree with another reviewer that this book was probably good twenty years ago."
5,Excellent,"I found this C.D Tuitorial to be the easiest way for me to learn, I loose concentration to easily on a book. This easy to understand and fundermentally sound cd offers a great insight into T/A.My only question is....Where can i find the ""Advanced guide to T/A"" that is spoken about in the cd.....Could the author or anybody else assist?Philip J. Smith"
1,Not for the beginner,"The book does not have a glossary in the back of the book so we can look up words that the author failed to tell us the meaning. I emailed the author and asked him what certain trading terms meant in his book and I received an email back from somebody named ""Lisa"" that told me to look it up in the dictionary if you can't find the answer in the book. I think this person ""lisa"" was very unprofessional in the way she handled this email and her customer service skills need improving. There are better books than this one. This man is from another country other than America and he uses weird words to describe his examples. It's hard to understand."
4,Useful information.,I am just getting started into the world of technical analysis and trading stocks. This book is really helping me to understand some of the things I have been observing in the market. The best thing about the CD is the quizes. The reader's voice can put you to sleep - especially if you read the chapters first - he covers the exact same text.
3,Be Careful of the Reviews,"I have not read this particular book, but that is not what my warning concerns. Sharif Biggs' review is more than contrived and slanted. I am not KJV only advocate, nor am I particulary attached to any one version. I also have ThD in Biblical Languages and am trained in many other ancient languages as well. I am quite well versed in the manuscript debates, as I teach Manuscript Evidence. This is all stated to let you know that I am not a hack or one looking to pick a fight. Instead, I would like to plainly state that Sharif's attack of the inclusion of Mark 16:9-2 in the MT is completely unfounded, as are his other remarks, such as the CT was around before the MT. They were concurrant, at least as early as the 3rd Century. Which is more reliable IS the debate, and both sides have the right to present their views. It matters not to me which you choose, but at least be aware of Sharif's obvious flaws and bias."
4,Interesting read,"This is one of the more interesting books on bible versions as the author has a view and expresses it well. The author is a Majority Text advocate. I don't accept any of his conclusions however regarding the superiority of the Majority Text over the now standard UBS editions, or his liking for the NKJV over and above what I consider better bibles like the NASB. So in that sense I disagree with the majority of stuff in the book. But the book is an interesting read, as I said."
1,Not the God I know.,"The God I know is through Jesus Christ my Lord.As in John 3:16""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life"". Well this author believes the NKJV and the KJV are written from the same text. (...) The NKJV is a works for salvation bible as seen in Romans 11:30,Romans 11:32,1 Corinthians 1:18,2 Corinthians 2:15.Compare these verses in the KJV.Knowing his poor discernment in this area alone I cant recommend this or any other book he writes."
3,Not entirely chair yoga,"I purchased this DVD in an effort to find a chair workout video that I could still do with a stress fracture in my foot. I am using a walking boot but have limited mobility so I can't do a regular exercise routine. I bought this DVD because of the price and hoped it was in fact ""chair"" yoga. Well it starts off great, but about halfway through they move to a standing sequence that uses the chair to help with balance. So if you're looking for a workout that is entirely in a chair, this is not it. But it does seem like a good video for beginners who have never done yoga before and are not already physically fit."
3,Yoga? Barely,"The best part of this dvd for me is the bonus kickboxing segment. It gives an all over mini-workout for those who can stand while holding onto a chair. Chair exercisers may want to go more slowly than she does though. The main ""chair yoga"" program starts out good with breathing, then goes too fast without an appropriate warm up for lifting arms above the head; she has the class lift both arms up and overhead at the same time instead of one at a time to begin with. She does have two other people doing the exercises with her only at a different level so there are 3 levels to choose from with or without weights. The attitude of the trainer is hurried strength training rather than calm yoga."
5,Exactly what I needed!,These pot toes work better than expected. No rain or overwatering to cause my outdoor plants to end up with root rot!
4,They found heaven!,This is truly great. With a very good enemy even better good guys. With twisted evil enemies traps and bizarre weapons. I do reccomend this book!
5,An Unknown Classic,"I love this book, this book is singlehandedly the one thing that made me such an avid reader. This book is a very original piece centering around a sword wielding dragon and his dragon boy. If you read this book expecting the dragon to be an intelligent creature almost like a human, you might be sorely disappointed, but that is still no reason to put this book aside. It is a fresh new look on fantasy and has extremely realistic characters and scenerios and worth the read. However, later books in the series get a little boring and tired out.The people who may not enjoy this appear to be the ones not open to new ideas or a change of scenery in the fantasy world. So if you like your classic fantasy tales, then avoid this book. But if you like the oddball fantasy about a sword swinging dragon, then read this."
5,One of Christopher Rowleys bests!,"Bazil Broketail is one of the most addictive, exciting and fun to read books I have ever read. It includes amazing fight scenes, exciting plot twists and simply phenominal charachter developement. You follow the lady Lagdalen and orphan boy Relkin through marching legions, intense clashes with imps and trolls, powerfull sorcery, and much more, not to mention the Dragons with their gargantuan strength. A masterful beginning to the wonderful set of books. If you enjoy any of the above, even a little you will be rapt with attention the whole way through. But don't take my word for it, read Bazil Broketail yourself and experiences its greatness first hand."
3,O.K. - Only for die-hard Fantasy lovers.,"The subject matter was very appealing to me and I think that kept me going through it. The relationship between theboy and the dragon (Bazil) is humorus at times. I was able to finish it and may read on but it is not one of the topseries I have read. If you LOVE fantasy, you'll like it but if characters, setting and story flow are important to you I would look elsewhere.It didn't keep my interest as well as say the ""Guardian of the Flame"" series by Joel Rosenburg or any of David Edding's classic series. It's actually sort of depressing and dreary."
2,OK story but lacking in the creativity.,"The story of Bazil the Dragon and his boy is a time told story of good against evil. Unfortunatly, Rowley doesn't put enough description in his writing. It is a good fast read well acceptable for younger readers, but its predictability causes the mature reader to lose interest"
2,Reenie,It was OK; a little too sweet. Found that it was not as flavorful as the English Toffee Cappuccino which sadly to say I can't seem to get any more!
2,so-so...,"got it from local grocer, didn't want to wait for shipping. strangely , its not bad and no chemical taste unlike their instant line, maybe its diluted or the coffee in this was not tainted. i do have to take about 15 tsps to get a strong enough hit though.but then there is this mild throat irritation.and it did fade to too little rush remaining for contentment. i had something sweet, a peanut butter fluff sandwich. and then i took like 5 tsps more. and then i just got this ""something doesn't feel right"" feeling, it wasn't a sick sensation. i don't get it.i just i should switch back to folgers brewed, even though it weak in a way compared to instant when it was good, there were no "" mild throat irritation"" and/or ""something doesn't feel right"" feeling."
3,Not the best.,"I bought this in hopes that I could make a great French Vanilla Cappuccino at home, instead of having to stop at WAWA (store on the east coast) everyday. Unfortunately, this wasn't what I was looking for.The instructions say to add a few scoops and then add more as needed. I was up to six scoops in a 16 ounce mug, before I gave up realizing that it wasn't going to be as sweet as I was looking for. If you don't want your cappucino particualarly sweet, then you'll probably be able to deal with it, but if you've got a sweet tooth like me, then skip this."
2,Sizes run small,"The t-shirt arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion, but is not worth the price I paid ($25). It is very cute, but the material used is very thin. In addition the sizing is off. It is listed as ""ladies"" sizes but is not. I ordered a large for a friend, and it really is a medium. One should order at least one size bigger unless one wants a very close fit."
3,good but not great,"There are 3 ~20min. segments on this dvd. I like the idea of 20-30 minute routines because I can almost always fit them into my day, (the 45-1 hour dvd's I'm less likely to do because of the time committment). I primarily purchased this dvd for the strenghth work out, using hand weights. The routine is good, but I feel it moves too quickly from one exercise to the next. I realise they are trying to give a good workout in a short time, however I feel adding just a couple more minutes & doing the same amout of exercise would've worked better, for me at least. The core routine is also good, however I still feel it moves too fast & didn't offer much instruction. I enjoyed the yoga routine the most, although it also moves fairly quickly, although I use yoga dvd's daily, so I'm more familiar with the routines. I will continue to use this dvd, at least for the strength workout, but will work at my own pace. The exercise routine is good, works out many areas of the body."
5,canyon ranch dvd,I really enjoy this DVD! I like that all three types of workouts are available on one DVD. I really enjoy the yoga
5,great value radio,This is a great radio for the price. It's size and shape make it convenient to carry around and the reception is fabulous.
4,Very Good,The controls are simple and easy to use. Good quality sound. I like how easy it is to shift between AM/FM/TV and the preset channels.It does not come with a cord to plug into the wall and should be better with a back light display.
3,Sony ICF-M410V,"I gave this product 3 out of 5 stars. No manufacturer that I know of offers a good quality table radio anymore. This model is decent, but I would have purchased a larger model (with a good sized speaker) if one were available. Instead, the cost cutting is obvious. There is no handle, and the overpriced AC/DC adapter is not included. The manual tuning knob has a cheap feel to it and does not operate as expected. There are only 5 presets to each band which is not adequate. It is unfortunate that a good table radio is no longer available. The GE Super Radio is still made with a large speaker plus a separate tweeter, but it has an analog tuner and the build quality is questionable."
1,Sony Quality Slipping,"I've had this radio for just over a year, and the LCD display has begun malfunctioning. Some of the display digits are only partially visible, so tuning is impossible. This is so annoying when you think how long radios USED to last. I bought a valve radio in the 1960's that still works fine, but this Sony product is a throw away."
4,TV reception is spotty depending,"We're satisfied with this radio. I like how it will turn on in the event of a weather emergency. We live right on Lake Michigan and have trouble getting decent TV audio, but that's the only negative. It's a big negative for us because that's why we got it. But like another person said, the AM is very strong and have no trouble with the reception for weather. It's meant to sit on a windowsill or countertop. Not be carried around to the beach or whatever, so there are no handles. Also, why anyone would want to listen to this with headphones is beyond me."
5,Great little radio!,This is a great little radio. Very convenient size & attractive. Good sound quality. Bought one for myself and one for a gift. Recommend. It's a good product.
4,"Great little radio, clear reception.",Purchased this as a gift for a co-worker who's last TV-band radio from 25 years ago finally bit the dust. She loves listening to her soaps during the day and the reception of the TV band stations on this radio is crystal clear. Her office is an interior office within a large steel and concrete office building. It's very small and compact and the digital tuner is fabulous - no more tweaking the old dial-tuner as you walk around the office waving the antenna around tring to find that clear signal.We both wish it came with an A/C adapter. She goes through 6 AAA batteries about once a month and has it on for about 6 hours a day.
4,The New Replaces the Old.,"In 1979 I bought a transistor radio similar to this so my wife could hear the Soap Operas while we were camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. It lasted until a couple of weeks ago and I replaced it with this Sony radio. Naturally, the new electronic items of today are superior but there's one thing my old one had that I wish this one had: a handle! That is very handy with any transistor (""portable"", I guess, these days) radio.Other than that, it's a great product. I'm sure you can't go wrong with Sony no matter what the product. If this radio had a handle on it I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Sony ICF-M410V Portable FM/AM/TV/Weather Radio,"I purchased this radio for the features and they are just what I was hoping for. The digital Tuner with push-button presets makes it easy for everyone to listen to their radio station. The sound is a little ""tinny"" but I use it in the bathroom for the morning news and traffic reports. It takes 3 penlight batteries, which have been working for a month now.I would recommend this radio to anyone who isn't looking for HI-FI Stereo sound."
4,"Decent, but not Great","This radio plays well and the push buttons are a real convenience. However, when the radio is playing, the user cannot check the time without turning the radio off. The design of the radio is a kind of taper towards the top which makes carrying the radio a bit awkward - a handle would have been a nice touch. Also, the manual does not tell the user how to work the weather band. There a several channels, but none of them bring in any reports."
3,it is a pity that fm is not stereo sound,"I got this radio, and found that it is mono output to the earphone of FM, it is really a pity, if is a stereo output!"
4,Mostly nice radio,"One odd thing, when the batteries get weak the radio does not fade gracefully, it just shuts off. I assume it's a sample defect."
5,great radio,"Good Sound for a small radio. Great reception, takes only 3AA batteries which have not needed to be changed yet. Nice features. Well made."
4,Nice Portable Radio For The Price,"I like to listen to the radio in the morning while I'm putting on my makeup and getting dressed. This portable is great---it sits on the shelf in my master bathroom and I can hear the news and traffic info while I'm getting ready. The pre-set buttons are great because I can change stations quickly. This radio is also easy to pack into a bag for a trip to the beach. For the money, this is a terrific value. My only negative comment is that the digital clock no longer displays while the radio is on--the radio station displays instead. Wish Sony would display both."
3,Thank you for these REVIEWS!!!,"So glad I read the reviews and caught that there was NO POWER CORD INCLUDED, it allowed me to cancel my order just in time.Who sells a radio with no cord...kind of silly to me."
1,Will the TV portion of this work after the digital conversion?,Will I still be able to receive the TV signals after 2/2009 when analog goes away? Or will I need a converter of some sort?
5,Great for sports,"Good AM reception. Easy to switch between stations with the digital pre-sets. Good TV audio reception using the antenna. Easy to carry around the house. Big enough display. Clock is a nice bonus. The unit is kinda big and slightly heavy for a briefcase, but it has a ""hold"" switch if you decide to bring it with you. I bought Duracell rechargeable batteries for it and they last a long time. Follow up - A year later it is still great. The rechargeable batteries still last a long time. Good FM reception using the included antenna, music sounds pretty good for this small package. Great for listening to ball games."
4,srg,radio seems good picks up lots of stationsonly deficiency is the tone is just a bit off but livablegood size
2,Just the thing,My husband is an invalid...a hospital type table beside his bed. He loves to listen to the morning shows and music all day. Can't have wires for regular radios so this Sony is the best thing since sliced bread. (That tells our ages) Love it! Thanks Sony....and Amazon
1,static noise uwing the ac adaptor and AM,"I bought this radio for AM usage. when you plug it in with AC, you get noise on AM. sony discontinued the old adaptor that had no problem with nose and introduced this one. i thought sony meant quality. this radio is junk for me and i am returning it. i called sony and they were aware of it, but not too concerned. they told me to search the net and find the old adaptor. it sells at a premium, no thanks sony."
2,Not worth $40,"The other reviewers are correct that the FM reception is good in this radio, but I didn't buy this radio just to listen to the FM stations, afterall this is an AM/FM/TV/Weather radio. If all people care about are just the FM, there are plenty of AM/FM radios out there at a lower price. For me, I want to make use of the AM/TV/Weather feature as well.CONS:-No AM reception inside of buildings.-Mono headphone (but I was able to get sound from both sides after easing the plug out a bit.)-Weather reception is very weak.-TV reception is moderate (Some stations came in all right, but not the others.)-Only 5 presets for FM.-$40 is too much if all you can hear are just the FM stations.PRO:-FM works great."
4,Good Radio,"I would have given this little gem of radio a 5 instead of a 4+ but it has some weak points. Mainly Strong AM stations splatter over 20 MC on the dail making it hard to tune weaker stations close by, but rotating the radio may clear this up. Also a light for the display would have been nice. Other than that everthing works as advertized.Indeed the AM sounds excellent on local stations and is very listenable for long periods of time on talk as well as music programs. I noticed with a thunderstorm close by that the static is filtered very nicely on this radio. The radio picked up a weak station from 100 miles well and a strong Chicago station from 300 miles very well. The AM sounds as if you are listening to a much larger radio.I would say for the average person this radio has many fine features and very good quality for the price."
1,don't buy -- especially from J&R Music World,"At work, we ordered this for the office. When we ordered, amazon wasn't selling it directly -- you had to purchase through an amazon affiliate, J&R; Music World, and you had to pay shipping. What you don't see in any of the specs is that THIS RADIO DOES NOT COME WITH AN A/C ADAPTER. The A/C adapter costs $19.88 through J&R;, and who-knows-how-much through Sony, the manufacturer. I don't understand how this radio came to be in amazon's ""Top Selling"" list with that grievous omission. It's probably the most returned radio as well... if you can return it.J&R; has a 14-day return policy, and you foot the S&H; for it all. Various members of our office took it home to find an A/C adaptor for it among their odds and ends, but none worked. By the time we decided to return it, we couldn't. And the A/C adapter comes at an outrageous scalper's price!"
4,Great Product,I am very pleased with this product. It is very easy to operate and the reception is very good. I like that it is so compact and easily moved to wherever I want to use it. The only thing that would make it better would be a backlight for the clock display.
5,Excellent portable radio,"This little radio has good sound, is portable, takes up little space, is great for use during storms. Play it in the kitchen when you are cooking or outside when you are in the yard. It is versatile and economical."
3,Decent AM/FM/TV/Wx Radio,"My Wife has used one of these for several years and likes it very much. For its size, it has better than average sound quality. AM and FM reception are good. TV reception is ok, but the Sangean DT-220v is better on weaker stations. Wx reception at our location is weak, but usable.This radio does not have a backlight, and uses 3 AA cells for power (I keep the extra cell from a 4-pack in the refrigerator for the next change...so this is not a big problem).This radio does NOT have a ""Weather-alert"" function.For better WX reception and potentially life-saving ""weather-alert"" alarm, consider one of the Midland radios offered on this site. (see my review of Midland Wr-100)Update April 16 2008:As a result of the switch from analog to digital TV in the US, the analog channels will be turned off Feb 19, 2009... The TV Audio band of this radio, and others like it will no longer receive TV audio!"
5,What you expect from a Sony.,"I wanted a small radio for the kitchen. Not a boom-box or anything big. Just something to listen to local news/weather/talk etc. from Chicago. We are about 60 miles away so most of our radios only receive a few strong stations (if anything at all). So I was very pleased at the reception of this product. It's the right size, the controls work well, everything from stations to time is easy to set, it just does what I was looking for and does it well. Worth every penny of it's modest price!"
4,"A little cheap, but sweet.","Very good reception, and I love the TV band. I've never had a TV band radio before. No bass to speak of, so it sounds a little thin. I'm not crazy about the cheap plastic look of it, but the overall design of it is really lovely. I'm very happy. It does its job and looks nice on the nightstand."
3,Sony radio,"Nice radio except it did not come with a power cord. I had to purchase that separately, and was disappointed it wasn't included to start with."
4,Great little radio,"It seems there's not a great selection of portable radios these days. I really like this little model. It's not too big. It has a sleek design. Reception is decent. I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is, but like I said, there's really not much to choose from. At this price, the AC adapter should have been included, but unfortunately I had to purchase that separately.Another drawback is that there are only 5 presets on this radio. And there is no seek/search feature."
5,where can I find another radio like this,I probably went through 30 AA cells before I bought rechargables for this radio. I lost it on a camping trip and am looking for something that compares. It was my favorite radio I bought it for $30-$40 and see now that you can only get it for 179$!$! as a refurb?
3,Where's the adapter?,"I bought this radio online to replace one of two that I already own. I love the compact size, reception, etc. However, this 'new' or re-packaged radio did not come with the adapter plug and these radios seem to go through batteries relatively quickly making it more expensive to operate. Had I known that adapter plug was not included, I would have skipped it. (It's nice to know from the previous review that I can get one at Radio Shack - but for another $25!)."
4,Sony the one and only,"I've had this radio about 3 weeks now and I think it's very good. It is a nice size - not tiny, not big, just right. I use in in the bathroom getting ready in the morning; in the bedroom while getting dressed & at night when I first go to bed. I've used all the functions - am, fm, tv, weather, clock. The reception requires some positioning for am and the antenna some movement for some fm stations but only a few stations in either am or fm. The tv is surprising strong and is handy to listen to the end of a show when you can't stay in front of the tv any longer. I highly recommend this mutli function portable radio."
5,Wonderful Radio,"I bought this radio to replace an older model which I had for over 15 years. They are long lasting and have extraordinary sound quality for a small portable radio. TV channels are perfectly clear and the the radio holds its channels well in all all modes (radio, TV, Weather Band. It is easy to set the channel pre-sets and to change them. This little radio is really a winner. You can't go wrong buying this!!"
3,Not too shabby,"Nice little radio...does not get AM reception at my desk...something to do with the building setup...boo...the headphone jack is only mono which is terrible, but it does force me to keep one ear open to hear the over head announcements. Overall a great radio"
5,Great little Radio,"This small radio gets excellent reception, produces very good sound, and is not overwhelming with technical features. It does what it does in a simple straight-forward way, and is good value for the money. It definitely has a place in our emergency preparedness box."
5,Just what I wanted!!,"I have purchased portable Sony radios for my entire adult life. It is always diffucult to let go of the one I have, but so neat to discover what's new. This little gem is the best yet! Don't think twice. Bye it!!"
5,Great cordless radio.,"I love this radio. I was looking for a radio that was small, had a clock and was cordless to be used in the bathroom. This one fit the bill. The sound quality is good. It's very small so fits well on the counter. Love it!"
5,Great little radio,"I received this radio as a gift to use at my office. I really wanted something with a TV band so I could listen to the local TV news at lunchtime. The reception on all bands is outstanding and the sound is really good for such a small radio with only one speaker. Overall, this radio meets my needs almost perfectly. My only wish is that it came with an AC adapter."
3,"Long battery life, nice digital tuning...but...","I like this radio alot. I think it's a nice compact package, and a features a great digital tuning, with the ability to listen to the weather, and TV signals. HOWEVER, turning it up to near the loudest setting, which I have to do when I am in the shower, you get an incredible amount of distortion. Nice radio, good speakers when on a low volume setting, but up high, the sound is really lousy."
2,Optional adapter,"Read the fine print. This does not come with an adapter. This is the first radio I have ever purchased that didn't come with the adapter. LAMEGood radio but now I'll have to drive to the store, or pay $5.99 shipping and handeling for an adapter. I could have bought a better radio for what I'm going to end up putting into this one."
2,Deception,"weak signal. am stations can be heard only at low volume. distortion if you go just a litle higher. tv channels only if you find the right angle-position. noise otherwise. volume increased when you touch the radio or the antenna. I have a better reception from a $10 Bell and Howell smaller radio. sorry I bought it. I was mislead by a name ""sony"" it should have said ""sorry"""
2,Smelly,The rubber head on this has such a strong smell of rubber. It is so strong that I would like to return it.
5,They'll never understand....,"Make no mistake about it; Blood for Blood music is for a very specific audience. So specific in fact that most people just don't ""get it."" This album (Serenity) departs somewhat from the past format both lyrically and musically - but it's essentially the same old Blood for Blood - and people still don't get it.I don't think anyone is really happy when a band puts out a replica of its past efforts - and certainly the musicians aren't. I like Serenity as much as Outlaw Anthems etc. The venom is still there; it's just delivered via a right-cross instead of a haymaker. Get it?I haven't found anything else that sounds more like a soundtrack to my life. From my trailer park upbringing, to the city streets, to prison and back again - Blood For Blood music has provided me and anyone else who's ever slept in their car and ""prayed to the night sky"" a weird sort of solace. It's hard to explain, but this music is like family."
5,Another Killer Album from the Best Hardcore Punk Band Around!,"This album is more like an EP, with only 9 songs, 2 of which are the same tracks and 1 of which is an intro with only words. The shortness of the album aside, this album is just perfection from start to finish. Every song is truly great. There are heavier hardcore songs like Serenity, Live the Lie, and My Jesus Mercy, which sound like Revenge on Society and Spit My Last Breath-era BFB. Then there is faster, melodic punk rock songs like Hanging on the Corner, A Rock n' Roll song, and City Boy. There is also a cover of the oldies song Runaway, which is undeniably catchy and fun, very cool. This album is just great, just like all the old Blood for Blood albums, they're the best hardcore punk band around. Very highly recommended to all fans of old BFB, punk and hardcore fans, and fans of general great rock n' roll, you should love this! PLEASE KEEP MAKING MUSIC BLOOD FOR BLOOD!!!!!"
3,still an amazing album but...,"its lacks the umpph that a normal blood for blood album usually brings. what happened to those lovable white trash dude from boston who hated everything. theyve gotten older and they care don't get me wrong this is not a bad album, its just not what i expected after all of the amazing past albums. for real fun pick up revenge on society or wasted youth brew"
4,Good Band,"pop = popular . if you say its too pop punk , you are saying its to popular for you to listen to ? 0_o .. please get a brain and stop listening to teens who sware they were born when the ramones and the clash came out .. they were but a twinkle in their daddies eyes when those bands were out :) .. kids ... anyhow , This band has some good songs to offer . im really enjoying this cd ."
2,Tooooooo looooooooooooong................,There is no reason for this documentary to be as long as it is. An hour would have been sufficiently to covered the topic.
5,What a novel is all about,"This book is perfect literature. It tells a story of many characters through many times all tied together by a special place. More importantly it draws the reader in and evokes true emotion. Cronin's writing reminds me of Gabriel Marquez in his ability to succinctly yet richly describe the mundane, making everything seem beautiful. I would give it ten stars if possible."
4,Great read,"Beautifully written, excellent plot and subplots interwoven for a compelling story. Cronin is a very gifted writer with great versatility ."
4,Fine soapy generational saga,Justin Cronin's The Summer Guest which is a kind of upscale Nicholas Sparks-type novel. A soapy generational saga told non-linearly (and that's not always managed well) about a family who run a fishing camp in the hinterlands of Maine. An entertaining beach/airplane read.
3,ambivalent thus far,"I am reading this book, it skips around a lot and there are so many characters, one can lose track of ""who's on first!""I'm not quite sure of the purpose, but I'll finish just to find out."
2,I'm surprised,I was surprised by the many positive reviews given this book. I tried to read this a few years ago. Couldn't relate to the characters and thought the style was blah.
4,Great characters,"I enjoyed this novel for the characters and the journey. The major plot twist was predictable, but that didn't distract from an interesting tale.The people and places seemed real, because Cronin took the time to paint a broad picture. A heartwarming tale that draws you in.If you're looking for a gentle engaging read, this book did for you."
5,Not a sappy love story!,"I put off reading this book for quite a while because the synopsis came across as just another sappy love story told from the recollections of a dying person - how many corny movies and books are out there on this theme?!This is not that kind of book - it's quarky, subtle, beautiful, and different.This book, is what turned me into a Juston Cronin fan. The first book I read by the author was the Passage - which I loved. Then I finally read this book, and I became a huge fan of Justin Cronin as a storyteller. I went on to read Mary and O'Neil (a book I both laughed and cried in, which doesn't happen often) and that cynched it for me - I'm a diehard fan!"
4,Vivid Pleasureable Read,"Justin Cronin's ability to develop characture's and the places they live is Amazing, Wonderfully developed Story, vividly described.It touched my Heart and my Imagination and isn't that what a good book should do? Quick Read, I didn't want to put it down and was sorry it ended.Michael"
5,The Summer Guest,The most beautifully written book I have ever read. I was stunned by Mr Cronin's narrative. I would give it ten stars if I could.
3,Strong story,"This is a strong story told through multiple points of view of several main characters. The problem is all the characters sound the same. The whole point of using this literary technique is to bring more depth and understanding to a story by the uniqueness of each voice. That's not to say that a writer needs the talent of a Faulkner to create distinguishing voices. But Cronin fails miserably in creating even a singular outstanding characteristic in differentiating each narrative, in not only how each character perceives what's going on, but also stylistically representing that difference. The voices are innerchangeable, which weakens the whole considerably. A real shame, given the fact that Cronin is truly a fine prose writer."
4,A love story from a man's point of view,"Justin Cronin surprised me, again. His story has a great setting, characters that are real and tells of a woman who loves two men, genuinely. I could relate to the situation and to the beautiful way the dilemna was resolved. I would have done with a bit less of the background which in the end didn't impact that much on the main storyline. Still, an absorbing read."
2,Not what I expected,I seriously LOVED Justin Cronin's The Passage I picked up at a store for $5 bucks and couldn't put it down until I finished it. So when I was done I immediately ordered this book because I just had to have more of him. Well I've had it for we'll over a month and I'm only on pg 129 out of 369. I thought it would be more adventurous with some love story as its core. But it's mostly about fishing and a father-daughter relationship so far. I will finish the book because I'm really hoping it picks up..all the while waiting on pins an needles for The Twelve to come out!
4,the summer guest,"i had read the passage first and was surprised at how good it was having never heard of justin cronin. so i looked up his other titles and bought the summer guest. although of a completely different genre, the summer guest, is also a fantastic read immersing you in characters and thiers lives spanning decades."
5,book review,Good read. I had a hard time putting it down to do other things. I like the way the author writes. He kept my interest throughout the book. and I like a few surprises in a story. I will read more by the author.
4,Good Live New Orleans Jazz,"Bourbon Street Swings--indeed! An outstanding collection of live performances by an assortment of Dixieland stars includes probably some of Sharkey Bonano's best music, with a driving rhythm section, rare recordings by Murphy Campo, featuring ""It's a Long Way to Tipperary"", some even rarer piano work by star Armand Hug, whose work is still basically on LPs and 78's, and Tony Parenti's elegant clarinet with a small combo. This CD captures the vitality of live jam sessions, including Sharkey's early admonition to his band to stop ""messing around"". I heartily recommend it for fans of authentic traditional jazz!"
4,Blows away the rumours.,"Loved the book its very straight forward, easy to read but every now and again has some translation problems. Starts with Otto Skorzeny's life before his military service to his time after the war. Includes how he become to be a member of the NAZI party, his opinion on why Rudolph Hess's flight to Scotland, the mistakes in germanies offensive both in the east and west, not to mention a surprising revelation of how much a traitor the intelligence chief CANARIS actually was!!!"
3,Amusingly enough the photo shows right hand use.,"I've never used it, but was looking through the stuff and the photos are the same for right and left hand use. At least flip the image guys. LOL."
3,Great watch with terrible band,"A good dive watch with a terribly uncomfortable hard rubber watch band. I gave it an overall rating of 3 stars based on 5 stars for the watch proper and 1 star for the band.Besides being uncomfortable, the band loop is a very sharp edged metal (SS). It pinches skin whenever it's moved.I replaced the watch band within 48 hours after receiving the watch."
3,Not for everybody.,"I've been blocked for months. After reading all the good reviews, I decided to try On Writer's Block; and while the book was interesting, it does NOT offer a solution for all types of creative blocks. I found nothing outstanding or particularly original. It doesn't work magic, in other words, and so the best cure for writer's block may simply be to overcome it naturally and on your own.For some people, however, this book may be a good experience in learning and maturing healthily as a writer/artist/creator. Would you benefit from reading it?...possibly...These are some of the general suggestions given:1 - Relax, and don't force yourself to write. A block could be a sign that you've been overworked.2 - Find a quiet, comfortable, and easily accessible place in which you can write whenever you feel inspired to do so.3 - Don't submit to over-ambition, or you'll find that you criticize yourself so much that the actual creative process is diverted. And don't set outrageous goals."
5,The definite work on the subject,"I have never looked at Writer's Block the same way again after reading this book. She shares wonderful stories of other creative artists, defines a number of common blocks, and best of all, ways out.It has a very psychological approach to the creative spirit."
1,Not like the older ones,"I bought this to replace one I had purchased 5 years ago. The new one is not the same material as the one purchased 5 years ago. The first strong wind that blew at my home, the new one ripped on the corners. Not nearly as durable as they use to be."
2,"Not good for a flat table, also not good for a folded table","I bought this shield to protect the ping pong table of rain. My purpose was not to bend the table and keep it open but it is was not possible because the guard is easily lifted by the wind and it brings nothing to tie it to the table.With the table folded happens the same, the wind lifts the shield easily, the designer forgot to put something to attach it to the table.I would not recommend this product to anybody."
3,replacement ping pong table cover,We bought our first Butterfly ping pong table cover in 2009. It lasted a couple of years before it got torn. I recently ordered a replacement one- same model and brand. The nylon material of this one though seems much weaker and lighter than the one we bought two years ago. We'll see how it holds up.
2,Not for use with any amount of wind,This product looks great on the table. It goes on and off easily. That's the good and the bad of this product. We live in South Texas and get high gusty winds during some parts of the year. This top only stays put with bungee cords.
4,Thin cover,". For the price I pay for this, I was expecting something thicker and more durable. But it's light and look nice, so I guess it's good enough for indoor use."
2,Can't believe I paid so much for this piece of garbage,"When I saw the price and all the good reviews I was expecting a good durable product, but apparently not. The material is very thin, and water leaks through. It is very cheaply sewn, after a month it actually tore. I do not recommend it at all; it is a complete waste of money. Only reason to award 2 instead of one star were the zippers. I was very disappointed by everything else."
3,Does the job,"We ordered this because our tennis table sits outside by the pool all season.It's a little big, but better than too samll. The only problem is that it faded A LOT and looks dry. No cracks yet, but I don't think it will last for too many seasons. We store it indoors over the winter, but I expected better quality for the price."
4,great product,love the zippers. makes it very easy to take it on & off the table even when the table is folded. looks good too.
5,Butterfly table tennis cover,"Very good quality, worth the few extra dollars. Zips from both sides which makes it much easier to get on and off without ripping. Since I keep my table outside, I would have liked it to be a foot longer"
2,"Whoops, maybe the editors should have TESTED the recipes","The VERY FIRST recipe I attempted from this book led me astray. Although sugar was listed in the ingrediants for the Chocolate Chip Muffins, it was sadly missing from the instruction text. By the time i realized it (as in, ""hey,these have no flavor"") it was too late. I guess no one double-checked these recipes before printing them. I can only guess how many others in the book are incorrect. Pretty pictures, but so far a waste of my time and money."
3,Later Edition?,"I don't have the first edition of this book, which I assume the previous reviewers had. When I checked what they said about the missing ingredients in instructions, that wasn't the case. So I assume the editors heard from others that the recipes hadn't been proofread and made the corrections in the second printing/edition.A couple of the recipes in this book are absolutely outstanding, mainly the Soft and Fudgy Brownies and the Rich Dark Chocolate Sauce. But in truth, the book contains very few recipes, so if you sit down with this book, looking for a chocolate recipe, you'll be through in three minutes and might not have found something you think is right for the occasion."
4,"A somewhat more modern treatment of elasticity theory, including plane strain","I have gone to Green and Zerna for its treatment of plane strain in terms of complex variables. Here it covers much of the material found in Muskhelishvili'sSome Basic Problems of the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity, but using a more modern approach that employs the Einstein summation notation. Mushkhelishvili's treatment of plane strain is more intuitively accessible, while that of Green and Zerna is more elegant and more familiar to the modern reader."
2,Not up to Sony standards.,"I have to say that I have used Sony microphones for over 20 years of my career with great success, this has got to be the worst yet, audio pick up is minimal at best, don't rely on it for conference or large area use, it doesn't pick up well at all, have used on several different digital recorders to see if was the recorder or the microphone, definitely is the mic.Guess the only thing I can say is try Olympus, you might have better success."
5,Great mic for concerts on a DSLR,"Love the mic. Here's a sample of the mic on a Nikon D7000 DSLR. I boosted the bass a little, but the mic was only a couple feet from the front of some massive speakers and it didn't distort.[...]"
2,Not good,The microphone picks up a tremendous amount of noise from touching the cord. As long as you never touch the mic or the cord during your recording it should sound fine.
2,Not a quality mic!,"I am a completed music education major, strong in both choral and instrumental suits, and this microphone is fine for the speaking voice but is not good for recording music. First of all it has a significant amount of noise that occurs even when the environment is completely silent. I used it on my laptop and on my digital recording device and both had large amounts of noise. Also the lower hertz(lower pitches or bass) are not very audible. The playback doesn't have a good sound in the lower ranges. I wish someone could e-mail me or tell me another mic that is of great quality in this same range. I have yet to find one.In short, don't buy this mic if you want to record music. Save your money I wish I had."
2,"work great for 2 months, not any more","Bought this to use with ZI8 and it worked great for about 2 months. After 2 months, I noticed that the sound playback was at a very low volume. Unfortunately, these low volume recordings were very important events, and I'm disappointed that the audio isn't good. I've tested the ZI8 with a different stereo mic and that works, so I know the problem isn't with the ZI8. Reseller has a 30 return policy and Sony's is only 90 days. Very disappointed this didn't last. I took the mic apart and the noticed the low quality soldering for one of the mics. The GND is shorted the White wire on the Right mic. This can't be correct? The PADs are very close together and I can't seem to remove enough solder to separate these PADS so that they aren't shorted. Wish I had a schematic of this board."
4,Works Well,"Is a little Hissy, but picks up well. I wish it was a little more sensitive to the midrange, as it seems to pick up base and extreme highs easier. I use it with a micro br to record our band live for learning purposes and for that it works great."
4,"Good Mic, but buy it on ebay for less than $10!","I got this mic from a seller on Amazon Marketplace for about $24 including s/h. That's about 1/2 the retail price for this, but I just found out, too late, that I could have got it on ebay for as little as $5 including S/H. I use it for my Kodak Zi8 pocket HD camera and it's great, so don't hesitate to get it...just make sure you get it on ebay for a lot less ."
3,Not to impressed,"Not too impressed with this ""stereo"" microphone, I am just as happy with the internal mic on the digital camera. dont waste your $$."
5,Timely and as advertised,Just received my mic. Very happy with the delivery cycle and can't wait to use it.
1,Only if you don't mind to also tape strange noises,"I did not realize, until I bought this mic, that the minidisc produces a continuous noise while taping. If you use a mic with a cable, the mic will be far from the recorder, and you will not tape the noise of the minidisc. However, this mic does not have any cable (main reason why I bought it), but then you get first the noises of the minidisc, and then whatever you want to tape."
1,Didn't work in my NJB3,"I wasn't sure if it would work in a Nomad Jukebox 3, and it didn't. So, I'm going to be selling it, since it was never used."
1,HISS!!!!!,"If you love the sound of ""hiss,"" then definitely buy this microphone because it's the noisiest piece of junk I've ever heard. Seriously, if you've worked professionally with microphones then you don't want this one. I bought two and both are going back immediately."
1,It was FAKE,"I bought two of these from ""SellingForFun"" for $30.96 which sounded a pretty good deal.I have received the Fake item! The quality just sucks! I am very disappointed!"
5,Microphone for Mini Disc,"This product is outstanding. The sound quality is excellent and the volume of the recorded sound couldn't be better. The resulting recordings are almost too loud. The only possible improvement would be to make it come in a brighter color so it could be more easily found on one's desk, perhaps yellow."
5,"Good Sound Quality, perfect for MiniDisc, MP3, WMA Recorder","I've been using the ""Radio Shack"" battery powered Lapel Mic and was never satisfied with this Sony I'm very happy with the Quality! Crisp dual channel sound, and no batteries to fail in the middle of your seminar! I highly recommend.Jason Nastwww.YourMDI.com[...]"
1,I wasted my money on this item from Amazon,"I bought this item to go with a Z10 Touch Video. It was recommended on Amazon and said it went well with this kind of camera. I bought it new. However, I didn't get to test it until a couple of months later, too late to return it. When I tried it, it did not work at all, despite following the directions. I got worse sound than if I used the camera without it. Now I'm stuck with a defective product. What a waste of resources!!!"
1,Bad for desktop recording and/or with Kodak Zi8,I tried it with Audacity on my desk to record my pod-casts and with my Kodak Zi8. Both pretty weak. I recorded someone talking with the zi8 as a test. First with the sony mic and then without it. First with mic sensitivity levels at normal and then again at max. The Sony produced much more hiss and was nowhere near the sensitivity of the Zi8's internal mic. The zi8's mic picked up so much more ambient noise and the voices were so much more robust. Was really surprised to hear all the positive reviews with the Zi8.
3,It's Okay,"I thought this mic would provide crystal clear audio, but it actually sounds kinda subpar. Admittedly, I haven't played with it much, but I'm involved in the music business and pay close detail to audio, recording, mixing, etc. This mic isn't for professional use, but even in personal or common use, it's just okay. Don't expect greatness."
3,Recording is crystal clear.,"I recommend this product for everyone who likes recording music like live performance. recording is loud and clear. Sound separation is ok. not really awesome but still very good for recording. Bottom line is, the recording is CLEAR without any distortions. you can add stereo effects using software like SONY soundforge. price is nice too.(Update)Having said everything is very good, I found out that this item i bought from amazon is FAKE. yes it records very good but it is A REAL FAKE item. the price is too good to be true. Beware of this Item. It is usually sold above $60. good enough at the very least it is usable."
4,Fantastic - With Some Drawbacks,"I've been using this now for a little over a month with my Kodak Zi8 in conjunction with a Radio Shack 90-degree adapter.For acoustic music, this thing is fantastic. Absolutely blew me away when I first played back the audio.For rock music it is still excellent. It has some limitations but then again, this is a small mic that fits in your shirt pocket.My biggest issue with it is that it picks up a LOT of ambient noise. To the point that I find it almost too much to use in certain situations.If you search youtube for Bingo969 - everything from 1 month ago and newer was shot with the Zi8 and this microphone. Picked up a fair mixture of straight rock to acoustic to bluegrass. For most situations I would definitely suggest this mic. It's worth it, especially if you catch it on sale."
4,There's no place like Nome,"People all over the U.S., especially in the music and poetry communities, are talking about Ken Waldman, ""Alaska's Fiddling Poet"". I picked up Nome Poems about a year ago when Ken was making a live appearance on Sedge Thompson's West Coast Live radio show (originates from San Francisco, syndicated to a bunch of public radio stations). Also, if you sign his mailing list, he sometimes sends you brand new poems, fresh off the tundra, by mail (postcards). For West Coast Live, he penned a poem for the occasion. As you would gather from his nickname, he is also a fiddler (notice the photo on book cover). He's developing a following among fiddlers, banjoists and guitarists who accompany him at various gigs. Many public radio stations also play his songs. He definitely synergizes these two talents well. His poems are accessible. You don't have to have understood The Waste Land or Cantos to get his (snow)drift. Nome Poems is a good place to start along the path of Ken."
4,Not a must buy...,"I actually like the Original Motion Picture soundtrack better than this symphonic re-orchestration. Yes, the soundtrack CD chops the songs into bits, but they flow pretty well together. The symphonic CD pretty much just puts those bits together into longer tracks- they still follow the action of the movie pretty closely, so it doesn't necessarily make for a better listen.Also, the recording of the U.S. soundtrack CD seems to have a better dynamic range than the symphonic (perhaps due to HDCD tweaking). Finally, the sythesized instruments are lost in the symphonic orchestration, which I liked in the score."
5,Amazing and entertaining,"Even if you haven't seen the movie, the ""Symphony"" Soundtrack for Mononoke Hime is GREAT. Compared to the American release of the soundtrack, this 8 track cd is much better. It contains extended versions of some of the songs from the regular soundtrack. These special versions of these tracks are excellent and the piano work is brialliant. My fav tracks are 4 and 8. I don't know if anyone would like to pay the import price, but if you like great blockbuster caliber its worth it."
3,"Good, but find the first OST!","Mononoke Hime is a must see for anime fans, if you can find the original film not subtitled but in japanese, there are a few scripts you can download on the internet that will amke the movie breathtaking. I don't know what to say about the US release of this film, with the popular voice actors they're using it's almost just a hype. It's a wonderful, meaningful movie, but not really a childs movie and that's what a lot of people usually think when they think of animation here. When I first saw it from a choppy early copy I was speechless and in tears, but everytime it's more beautiful. The first OST was captivating, I practically listen to it every week, but this rendition makes me skeptical about what's to come for mononoke hime. But hey, if you can't kind the first or second OST, this is a good choice."
5,wow! everything worked and nothing broke!,This is the most amazing piece of technologie i've ever touched! The sound is clear. The picture is great from a two foot distance but up close it's just a little messy. The player is very light even with the battery. It also comes with 2 headphone jacks and an AC adapter! It's also a pretty new product. I recommend this to ANYONE! who's looking for a dvd player. This counts as two reviews because my mom gave it 5 stars too. Don't look for a DVD player that doesn't brake on the internet all night long like my mom and I did. Just order this now.
4,Mastering VBA as learning tool,"Mastering VBA (Mastering)I have only just started to use this book to learn VBA.It is clear and concise and structured to lead a novice from basic macros through to more complex VBA scripting.The examples and lessons cover Word, Excel and Powerpoint at the same time showing any differences between the programs.It is well worth a look for people who use these packages but have not yet dabbled in VBA."
2,False Advertising,"I only had to scan the table of contents to realize that this product is not the ""end-all"" for VBA programming needs. The few dozen or so pages dedicated the MS Access are clearly nowhere near what is needed to leverage VBA capability for the program where it is most valuable: Access!Database programmers - look elsewhere."
2,Emily's Runaway Imagination,"Overall, not nearly as enjoyable as all the other books. While Emily is still a relatable character, this book is dated; such as references to most people not having cars, or the fact that back then, a dollar was a LOT to a kid. I did like how she handled Fong's character--added some much-needed life & diversity to the book, as well as giving Emily a very interesting relationship with another character, while I felt for the most of the book, she was a really 2D character. She's just a gossipy little girl in a gossipy little town, making for a slightly repetitive, boring story. Also, a word of warning to parents, there are references to drunkenness, not sure many parents would like their kids reading about that. Quite a disappointment...Rating: 2.5/5"
4,Fun and Funny,"If you like adventure then Emily's Runaway Imagination is for you! It's about a girl who liven in Pitchfork, Oregon in the first half of the 1900's and has a good imagination. Once she chloroxes the horse. Once she makes a pie crust that floats to the top of her pie, and once she thinks her mom is trading her for a monkey wrench! I hope you like this book because I certainly do."
4,Emily's runaway imagination,well l believe that all Beverly clearly books are amazing although advanced and some sentences too big. But this one was one of my favorite along with Roman Q. & Henry . H
2,Just so-so,"After reading the reviews I thought this book was going to be really good. I found the most helpful parts to be in the last few pages. Also, her website has a lot of great articles on the subject. I found I could put the book down, many times, unlike the other readers on here. It took me a while to get through. I would highly recommend her website for help and a more direct look at getting over an affair, rather than the book."
5,I should have read this book sooner.,"Two years after my own husband had an affair I came across this book. It has been so helpful. It is proof that affairs happen even in ""great"" marriages, and that, although the journey back is hellish, it is possible and well worth all the work and pain. Lots of love and hugs to you, dear friend and fellow reader. You are not alone and this book will become like a warm and friendly conversation with Anne, Brian, and their daughter on how to get back to just being ""us"" again."
1,My Husband's Affair Became the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me,The price of this book is way too high for the type of book it is. A more reasonable price would be $9.99.
1,"btw, its the cheaters fault","i borrowed a copy of this book, so glad i didn't buy it. useless. at no point in dealing with a cheating spouse does this book provide valuable material. instead read -Infidelity: A Survival Guide by Don-David Lusterman- and lets keep in perspective that when a spouse cheats it's got nothing, NOTHING to do with the hurt spouses actions or perceived behaviors. there is never ever anything you will do to MAKE someone cheat on you. never. ever. its a complete selfish act. they want both, the security you provide them and the cheap thrill their nasty partner provides them. sorry, that will never be the best thing to happen to me."
2,okay,If you are hurting from an affair this book is not going to help you.It was NOT at all what I thought it was going to be and was disappointed. Hard to believe that it was a true story.I think adding something from the husband would have helped the story. And who tells ALL of their friends that their husband cheated on them?
2,"one woman's story, not mine","People buy these books in hopes to help themselves. But the people are different, different circumstances and in the end it could be more harmful. I think the author and her husband took their story and are now capitolizing on what they did to now make money. They are only helping themselves and the book didn't help me."
2,Not as good as other books,"I read this book because of the title, but found it to be less that other books regarding affairs that I had read. The book is written from the betrayed wife's pespective, and tends to monologue to much and has a lot of religious basis. The fact that she was so out of touch with her daughter and the suicide attempts, confirmed for me that she must have also been very much out of touch with her Husband. I was the betrayed partner and found little refuge in this book.If you are religious this may be a good read, however having grown up in Church myself I found that many of the actions of the wife were not those someone with a strong religious commitment would do."
4,"Helped me feel a little more ""normal""","I found this book particularly helpful in normalizing the emotional roller coaster I went through, and the things that I thought, felt and did in response to those emotions. It helped me see that I ""wasn't the only one who..."" Anne describes her journey, and in the latter section, becomes increasingly self aware of the changes she wants to make in herself. Anne reflects on her personal growth, but not as thoroughly as I had hoped, given the title of the book. A helpful read regardless."
5,My Husbands Affair...............,Don't judge a book by it's cover.....This was a good read for anyone dealing with a cheating husband who wants to put the marriage back together. The author offers seminars online that are very beneficial to a hurting wife.Listen to the seminars together to heal you marriage. Very valuable.
1,"Wow, this is crap.","This is one of the worst of the cookie-cutter metalcore bands that surfaced after the explosion of the genre's popularity. Boring and simple riffing, totally predictable song structures, breakdowns thrown in for the hell of it, and horrid vocals both clean and screaming. Everything is lacking. This is even worse than Atreyu in some ways, and that's pretty sad. I mean seriously, metalcore is one of the easiest genres to master, and this is a sad excuse for a metalcore album. If you simply MUST listen to some Metalcore, go for All That Remains, Still Remains, Neaera, Killswitch Engage, Diecast, Anterior, Dead to Fall, or any of the dozens of these types of bands that do it better on all levels."
2,The Fararrs Are Recycling Information - Very Disappointing,"If you are like most Pagans, you have probably read earlier books by Janet and Stewart. This book was a thorough disappointment. I know that they can do better - we in the Pagan community have all have seen them do better. Now it seems that with this book they have just run out of steam. I have most of their books, the ""Witche's Bible Compleat"", ""The Witch's Goddess"" and the ""Witch's God"", ""Eight Sabbats for Witches"" along with ""What Witches Do"". These books are all informative and passionate about the Craft in their portrayal of pertinent information, etc. My question is: 'just *what* did these Witches actually **DO** when putting this book together - other than to regurgitate earlier information from the aforementioned books?"" After reading this book one can only come to the ineveitable conclusion that they certainly did not actually *do* much at all for the writing of this book."
3,Nothing New,"For those of us who have been involved in the Pagan community, and to new comers as well, this book holds nothing new."
1,It doesn't work. i want my money back.,"I bought this battery and it has not charged. It was in the plastic, but it doesn't work. I am very disappointed with this purchase from this vendor."
5,highly recommended,I highly recommend this book. It is a valuable reference and a great introduction to sobolev spaces for people interested in functional analysis.
5,a very good book in wavelets,This is a very good book in wavelets. It's included theory of wavelets and its application.
4,overall a good text,"I think the book is very good compared to other texts that I have perused on the subject. I am presently teaching myself the material so as to use wavelets for my research project. It is one of the most readable texts that I have encountered. I was looking for a very applied book and this seems a good one. There are some proofs but the text is not flooded with functional analysis theorems. There is one thing that I found disappointing. I found that in order to understand some things I had to jump to sections further into the book. Ideas are introduced and are not fully explained until later in the book. This leaves the reader puzzled and sometimes very confused when given the first exposure to a topic .(It is easy to get the wrong idea when you are given a superficial development). I think the development of ideas could have been more cohesive. Other than that, it is a good book."
3,Very specialized but not a good book for wavelets,I have this book for a wavelet course. I find this book cryptic and not very easy to learn about wavelets.
5,Leg Cramps,My 95 year-old father doesnn't complain of leg cramps at night since starting this product. He also doesn't need blood pressure medicine anymore which may have been the cause of the cramps to begin with. His doctor doesn't have any concerns with his use of this product either.
5,leg cramps,"This is a wonderful product for my leg cramps, this item is hard to find at any drug store, thank goodness for the internet"
1,FDA has banned products with Quinine,"Frankly,I am very surprised to still see this being sold on Amazon. The FDA issued a notice in 2006 to stop using Quinine for off-label uses due to the risk of heart related complications.In fact, the FDA issued an updated notice in 2010, which addresses the use for leg cramps, quote:""Qualaquin should not be used for night time leg cramps. Qualaquin use may result in serious and life-threatening hematological reactions, including serious bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome/ thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which in some cases may result in permanent kidney damage. In some patients, adverse reactions result in hospitalization and death.""source: [...]I am not a doctor, and cannot comment on the science behind the FDA's recommendation."
4,Kna gets his skates on,"Knappertsbusch has a reputation for slow tempi but surely not in Bruckner. If anything, this live, wartime performance is on the brisk side at under an hour, considerably faster than Karajan and much faster than Tennstedt in the ""Romantic"". His attack in the first movement is driven and propulsive, even a tad staccato. Once we get over the horn cracking on hts first entry, the playing is good if not as impressive as the Vienna Philharmonic and there are moments of suspect intonation. The Andante is delicate, even engagingly hesitant, the Scherzo infused with nervous energy, the Finale nervy and menacing.The sound is venerable with a faint but constant high-pitched whistle in the background but there is very little audience noise. For some reason there is a further deterioration in quality for the fourth movement - it become more distant - but it's all perfectly tolerable.Vintage Kna."
3,Could be better,Pros: Small size; web interface for setup; stores every remote command in the scroll wheelCons: Takes a while to get the remote working exactly the way you want it; each computer update takes about 6 to 7 minutes to upload to your remote (I've already updated mine over 10 times and I'm still not finished;
2,"Good idea, but...","The web interface is awkward. It took me several hours to set up the remote, and not all of the componenets I have are supported. It is possible to ""train"" the new remote to learn the commands of an unsupported remote; however, I was not able to do so successfully."
2,More trouble than its worth.,"I love the concept, but in practice I find that it is not as useful as you'd think. If you are not careful to keep the remote pointed at the 'system' for several seconds after issuing a command all the settings will not be executed. The remote does provide a 'help' function the steps you through the settings to correct the errors. However, this seems to happen so often that I end up using the original remotes anyhow. The remote is also a little too small and I find it difficult to hit all the buttons on the top and the side without dropping it."
5,Great introduction to the hobby!,"I've found the ""...for Dummies"" series to be pretty reliable, and this one is no exception. Very readable, and entertaining while informative. I have the Kindle version, and the illustrations are easy to make out on my Galaxy S III phone. Amateur radio is one of those hobbies with a lot of things you need to know, but this book covers all the basics."
3,Good but somehow unsatisfying,I am recently licensed and I bought this book hoping for information and inspiration. I got some of each and the book made me realize why Hams tend to specialize in certain niches within the field. I still haven't found mine
3,good book,good book. really helped me with my exam. arrived promptly in described condition. good price
4,Great place to start if you're THINKING of getting into HAM radio.,"There's really not too much to say about this book. The ""Dummies"" series of books are a great place to start with pretty much any subject, and for a lot of people, will have all the information you might need. If you're thinking of getting into HAM radio, this is a good source to learn some of the basics, and I'd recommend reading it BEFORE you actually buy anything, so you know the basics of what you're getting into. Above that, it covers all the basics well enough that you might not need anything more advance for a long time, if ever."
4,Helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful. As a ""new"" Ham, I found it useful with terminolgy, equipment and just getting on the air to make that ""first"" contact. The author included several resources for online help. The book covers a variety of topics from atenna's to global connections. I would recommend this book to any ""new"" Ham."
5,Ham Radio for Dummies,"This is a Great book, very helpful!I received the book in the time frame promised and at a great price! Thanks!"
4,Looks like fun,"I got this book because it looked like fun. I think the book is good for getting an Idea of what ham is, but I still have alot of questions. It won't replace a radio club or elmer."
4,Easy to understand,and amusing in some parts. Seems to be a good compilation of what you need to know to get started. I do know it's easy to follow.Very easy to navigate and narrow in on particular interests.
4,Good basic book to start with.,A good basic book to start with but I had to buy the Ham Radio License Manual w/CD to really get into it.
4,GOTTA LIKE THE BASICS BUT.........,"BEEN READING AND READING AND FEELING EVEN DUMBER. I FIGURE THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN FOR ME, BUT NOW I HAVE FOUND A COUPLE WEBSITES AND OTHER BOOKS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER AND EVEN INCLUDE THE TESTING QUESTIONS TO PASS THE TEST TO GET THE LICENSE. COST A LITTLE MORE FOR THE GORDON WEST BOOKS AND CD BUT ARE WORTH IT. HOPE MY SHORT TERM MEMORY HANGS IN THERE A COUPLE MORE MONTHS!"
4,Great Seller!,The seller was quick. The condition of the book as it was described. Would buy from again.
1,"Not much of a ""Reference""","This book has no questions and answers for the FCC test. It only answers the most basic of newbie questions, and certainly is NOT a ""Reference for the Rest of Us"" as many of the ""Dummies"" books can be. I would not recommend this book for anyone except the least literate and most technically-challenged among us...not exactly what Ham Radio really needs to have as members. I wish I hadn't bought it."
5,A Wonderful Way To Introduce Ham Radio,"Very often people will ask you about ham radio and although you love the hobby, you don't know where to start in describing it. This book fills that gap. It is a complete and comprehensive introduction to Ham Radio. It is a thorough review of what Ham Radio is and also what it is not!!I would recommend that every Ham has one in his or her shack to lend to a visitor who is curious about amateur radio. Much better than an incomplete and unprepared description from a single individual.David,WA2KWP"
4,Very good primer,"I bought this book just to see if ham was something I'd be interested in as a hobby. After reading this, and the technician licensing book put out by the ARRL, I had no problem passing my first exam and getting my license. The author also gives many website links throughout the text that are helpful in finding more free information.Overall though, I'd say this is a good starter book, if you just want to find out what amateur radio is all about."
5,great!!!!,"I have been a licenced ham radio operater for three years. HRFD has helped me discover a lot of the tricks that it took Ward Silver thirty + years to learn. It is easy to understand and fun to study. The subtle humor makes it a technical volume that will never collect dust. Thanks Ward, its about time."
3,Don't wast your money till after you get the licence,"Not being a ham radio operator , I expected this to be a ""study guide"" for the exam. It's not. It may be a great resource for some one who already has a license (""or the rest of us"") as stated on the cover, but there is no specific chapter or section set aside for study for the exam. It does however seem to be a good resource after the license is acquired."
3,A Decent Starting Point,As with most DUMMIES books the writing is fairly lively. If you know nothing this book will tell you a lot. For me its shortcoming is that it makes the explanation of the exams somewhat obtuse. It certainly does not prepare you to take the tests.
4,good read,"This book was recommended to me as someone interested in learning about ham radio. I had no concept of what it was all about, but after reading through this book I was able to determine whether or not it is for me. It is. This by no means is a prep course for becoming licensed, but provided me with an overall concept of what ham radio is all about."
4,sony cdx757mx cd changer,"changer works very well, sound quality is excellent, and no problems with bumpy roads. the only issues i have are in the mounting and installing new cds. i removed an older sony cd changer and found that the mounting pattern is completely different. standardized patterns or an adapter plate would be nice. i had to make wooden spacer blocks and install between the panel and body. also the cd holders are very flimsy and awkward to use. a minor point, the holders are not numbered and the play sequence is back to front. i would recomend this unit to be used with a sony deck. the xplode technology does make a difference."
5,a beautiful spiritual journey through John's gospel,"This book is beautifully written in very modern language which should be well-received by young and old. It is organized in such a way that it can be very helpful for group discussions and spiritual development. It's ""trail markers"", which are short insertions throughout between major divisions of the book, are new to me and helpful in leading into the next chapters. A very vivid look at who Jesus is as seen by John, and it is also a very personal look at the author's own spiritual journey. A fine book."
4,Well Played and Well Recorded,"Old-timers may remember that the Nonesuch label used to issue bargain-priced LPs that would sometimes feature orchestras such as the Buffalo Philharmonic. Those records were a bargain then; this new CD is a bargain today. Combining some better- and lesser-known works by Copland, all distinctly in his Americana idiom, well played and well recorded, this issue brings us nearly an hour of genuine musical enjoyment."
5,This is the original 1966 English version!,"I don't know why Amazon is crediting Paul Dobson & Kathleen Barr in this listing (perhaps something got switched? many versions available), but this particular series of VHS tapes from RTS (The Right Stuff International) studios, is the only series that I've found so far that contains the original, uncut 1966 English version of ""Kimba the White Lion"" featuring Billie Lou Watt as ""Kimba"", the music of Isao Tomita, and a male vocal theme song (with female chorus): ""Kimba (8x) - who's the King of deepest darkest Africa . . ."" All other releases so far have totally different voices, music, and theme songs. I am very, very happy with these VHS & DVD releases - they are just as I remember them."
2,Too big for smaller doorknobs,"This product works but it is cheap plastic and won't last long and if you don't have large doorknobs the product is much too big. The package says it should spin freely on the knob but on our doorknobs it sags too. This would be fine for larger knobs, though only if there is adequate supervision as well, because I think a determined child could break the plastic given a bit of time."
5,Favorite,I love the old hymns and this gives hours of blessings. Would highly recommend it to those who enjoy and miss the old hymns.
5,High quality replacement,Good quality and very easy installation procedure. You can buy a more more expensive product but not necessarily a better one.
3,Sony stereo mic,"I bought this mic to fit onto a new Kodak Zi8 camcorder. It is WAY better than the built in mono mic and does turn the unit into a stereo recorder. I chose this one because it is a powered mic which helps with setting the mic level - plenty of signal coming in for the Zi8. It does have a thin ""tinny"" sound, which was no surprise given the price range. I would have given it 4 stars if it had been in the 50-60 dollar range. Overall it's a good improvement to my set-up."
3,OK - But should have been a whitepaper.,"The first 3rd of this book was a good coverage of Phishing with interesting information on techniques, prevalence, up trend, etc. After that the book feels like the authors ran out of material and began to scurry between subjects like network address translation, intrusion detection systems, and enterprise incident response teams. Basic 101 security stuff available in far better detail else ware.Ultimately the authors' suggestions revolve around hating Microsoft, buying a new Macintosh, etc. and not using the web at all.Again, the first 3rd of this book was quite good but the rest seemed to read like page filler. Still, it seems to be the first and only book dedicated to Phishing.I'm looking forward ""Phishing Exposed"" pending its release by Syngress, and pre-ordered here on Amazon.com"
3,"Flakey writing style, but with a lot of information","The authors claim this book is for a wide range of people from network administrators type people to any one who wants to learn about phishing. Though there is a lot of information in this book, most of it will be common knowledge to people who are employed to keeps networks secure. This books would be great for some one who has been scammed, if you can overlook the flakey writing. For instance, instead of Congressmen they refer to them as ""Congresscritters"". It was annoying and difficult to keep much of the authors' information seriously. If you can ignore this, you will learn a lot about phishing scams, what to avoid, and how to recover from one."
2,Not What I Expected At All,"These are hits by the original artists but they are not the songs as you heard them on the radio or on other albums (studio versions) and so they are not the way you remember them. I suppose if you are a frequent concert goer and are accustomed to your favorite songs sounding quite different from the ""album"" or ""released"" version, you won't be bothered by this. I think this set would have been more aptly named: ""Rock N Roll of the 70s - And Everyone Is On A Comeback Tour"" or ""Rock N Roll of the 70s - And Here's What We Sound Like Today"" or something like that. Overall, I was very disappointed.Rock N Roll of the 70s"
1,Ouch!,"Horrible recording quality, not the original, single versions...Buy the Billboard series instead."
1,Not original artists,I was very disappointed. None of the songs were from the original artists. Do not buy this!
3,Not for the faint-hearted,"Interesting but macabre ways of how people have died in unusual ways over the centuries. Certainly not for the faint-hearted and not to be read all in one day.(or dinner won't be pleasant) If you ever moved to disagree with the adage ""I could be run over by a bus tommorrow"", think again!.."
2,"um, not funny","In case you've never heard of or seen this book, it's a compendium of bizarre and supposedly humorous ways that people have died. The book's cover is morbidly black, and the title has an exclamation mark after it. Aficionados of the Darwin Awards will be upset: almost all of the deaths in this book are rather tame, and not more than a handful are funny enough to justify the disrespect for the dead that their inclusion in this book implies. Overall, it simply isn't that funny, and I don't recommend it to anyone."
4,I hate flunkies that write rreviews,"Would just like to say that I wish all the Danzig fans that are bummed out that their model got knocked out would stop writing bad reviews of music that they probably have never even listened to. Frustratedwhatever's review should not stop anyone from checking out this CD. There are some great tracks on it, actually the whole thing is pretty damn good. Danny didn't knock Danzig out for publicity, he did it because Danzig pushed him. Nothing more. Check out their website. True story there. Check this one out. It is a good buy. Great music.. AZ style..Cheers.."
4,Good brand,"I love the Rainbow Light brand for the fact that it uses whole/natural ingredients rather than chemicals. I have tried Candida Cleanse (LOVE) and 2 different types of vitamins (Women and Energizer). I'm not sure I see a difference in my energy levels when taking these Energizer One multivitamins. I do like the amounts of vitamins in them, so I know they are beneficial in that regard.I also like the Rainbow Light ""Just Once"" line. I prefer to only have to take one tablet a day rather than multiple pills each day like others. Granted, the tablet is not small by any means, but I'd still rather only take one."
2,No difference in Energy,"I have been taking Sams Club multivitamins for women for over 6 months now and I switched to these Rainbow Light One Engerizer vitamins for the benifits of added energy. However, I have noticed no difference in energy levels whatsoever. I will not buy this product again."
3,Not Bad.,A decent continuation on the X-Men: Evolution series. I recommend them all for any Marvel or X-Men fan.
2,General,I have watched and read my share of serial killer artical/movies...ect. This is so general with alot of jumping around from story to story. Do yourself a favor and save your money. The great thing is that I only paid two dollars for this on ebay. But again I would have prefered to have my two bucks back.
3,OK,"Politics, politics, politics... I am disheartened when I read books such as these that act as though the Constitution is plain in its meaning and obvous in its desires. The fact is that 39 white, male land owners signed the document with different thoughts as to how the document would transfer to later generations (Jefferson even talked of rewriting it every 19 years). It is difficult to conceive the nature of the world 200 years from now, so there is little use in asking whether James Madison smoked pot for his glaucoma or if Hamilton thought that everyone should own a M1 Abrahms tank. The Constitution should be viewed as a tool in protecting certain rights and which rights these are vary from individual to individual. Of course we'll never get all nine old farts in black robes to admit this, but the 2000 election should have been a convincing example."
5,Good to be King,"Awesome book Mr. Badnarik! I listened to a 1993 series of his lectures before reading the book, which may have made the book easier to understand, but I felt so enlightened. I would like to read more from him on the Constitution. Mr. Badnarik writes in an easily understood manner. If you are interested in the Constitution and how your priveleges have been stolen from us...definitely read this book. I only wish I could get some young people in my life to read this book."
3,Good coffee for the price and convience.,"Amazon rocks! Five stars for Amazon.I liked the taste for a while and then for some reason I liked it less.To describe it best, it can taste like hot Cocoa Cocoa Puffs. I found another brand and switched to it. Sorry Folgers."
1,Ridiculously expensive,"I love this coffee and have been drinking it for many years. While it is getting impossible to find at stores around where I live, I would never dream of spending this kind of money for 6 cans. My Lord, the most expensive place sells this for $4.02 a can. Why would you spend twice that amount here?? Crazy!! If you all have lots of disposable income, I can send you a list of some good causes that need your money more than these sellers who are ripping you off."
5,This is a great book for engineering students,This book explain the engineering greatly . What is engineering? Is engineering for me? What is design? All the answers in this book!
1,Too cinematic for my tastes,"The game felt too much like a movie to be truly entertaining as a game. They included an actual actor and modeled everything about the main character after him. For a video game, that's wrong.My other complaint is that it's unreasonably difficult. Before you accuse me of being a coward let me inform you: I've played games like Ninja Gaiden and Demon's Souls (infamously difficult games) and loved them. This one was just...no. It didn't feel like a Spy Hunter game, either. I liked the idea of playing as the agent himself, but it focuses too much on the Rock and not enough on the Interceptor. Furthermore, the Interceptor is horrible compared to its predecessors. Its guns are inaccurate, slow, and don't respond well, and it blows up after being shot thrice.If you're a fan of Spy Hunter and Spy Hunter 2, I would NOT recommend this game on any measure of the mind. If you're only in it for the Rock, have fun."
1,Don't bother,"Bad controls, blocky characters, poor driving. Even having ""the rock"" in the game can't save it.Hate to say it, but don't waste your time. Spy Hunter II was better than this one, and that is a real insult to this one..."
4,hardcore punk,"something like the circle jerks.you should hear their version of judas kiss, played at breakneck speed.The best song in my opinion is Hey Punk."
2,it IS an encyclopedia,"Well. i should have read the description better. it IS an encyclopedia. Alphabetically about everything surf related from a to z. Small letters, and almost no pictures. I havent bothered reading much in it because of that..Buy surfing illustrated instead!"
5,The Leviathan of Surf Books,"This is the ultimate surfing book for both the hard core surfer and the wannabee. Everything under the sun (and surf) is covered and presented in an interesting and informative way. The book is big so you definitely get your money's worth. I haven't finished reading all of it--but I'm not sure that even possible. It's the kind of book you can pick up and spent 10-15 minutes reading a few entries and then come back to it later. I liked Warshaw's other books, particularly Mavericks, but this is a really different beast. An ambitous attempt to cover the entire scope of the sport in detail. He pulls it off totally."
5,Don't leave home without it!,"This is an amazing read for anyone interested in surfing history and culture. As a surf writer I couldn't do without it! As a fan of surfing, it's a Bible of information. Love it!"
5,The Encyclopedia of Surfing by Matt Warshaw,"Another fine book that brings back the old memories my surfing days along the West coast of California in the 60's. If you're an old surfer or a new young surfer, you will really enjoy this great book!!!!"
2,Bring back the Original,"I also want to add a plea to bring back the original. Songs are great, performances on this album fall well short of doing the songs justice."
1,I am getting my act together and taking it on the road,A poor substitute. I want to add to the chourus of bring back the original. My tape wore out years ago and I have been trying to replace it ever since.
2,"""Old Friend""--what a song!","My favorite recording is Anne Hampton Callaway on ""Sibling Revelry"" followed by Michael Feinstein on ""Live at the Algonquin."" Unfortunately, I'm not wild about this cast. I'd love to hear the original if it ever comes back in print."
3,"Certainly not the original, but it's better than nothing....","I first heard this musical in the 80's and played and played my roommates record! I'm excited to even hear the songs again, even if the passion of the original isn't there. The singers are still good, and it's fun listening."
2,What a disappointment!,"I saw this fantastic play in Los Angeles around 1985, purchased the tape and wore it out! Fabulous music. Unfortunately, this CD changes the wonderful lyrical memories with its offbeat cadence and intermittent dialog. It is only remotely similar to the play I attended. Two stars because it brought back memories, otherwise ONE star!"
1,I'm getting my act together and taking it on the road,"I spent my last 15 years looking for this tape andfinally located it. Unfortunately I was so disappointed.The singers didn't have any of the emotional impact ofthe original cast. Their voices weren't powerful andthey ruined the songs for me. Please try to bringback the original recording with Gretchen Cryer. I sawthe performance at Circle in the Square in the 70's, andto this day I still remember how powerful the play andthe songs were."
2,Where to locate the original,"Check out barnesandnoble.com for the original recording. In this version (E.g. broadway recording, the songs have so much emotion and feeling! It's a great recording."
2,Disappointed,"I also want the original not this cd. My album is skipping and scratching, but this cd can not replace it. Please some one redo the original."
5,It's about as perfect as a simple little radio can get.,"This radio is pretty much exactly what I expected in purchasing a small radio. It has good reception, handles minor abuse well, and all the switches and dials are in their right places. What more can I ask for?Just an operational tip: This radio is very light weight and has a sturdy clip on the back side. In order to keep it and the headphone wires out of my way I clip it on my shirt behind my neck and put the excess headphone wiring down the back of my shirt. It stays neatly in place, doesn't uncomfortably pull the shirt back, and doesn't get caught on anything (hands, workout equipment, random counters and tables) as it would on my waist band.Enjoy!"
1,blade broken,a blade was broken. not worth the extra money to send it back. it would start fast and the broken blade would make a lot of noise. as the fan slowed down it sounded quiet. if you get a good fan i'm sure it work very quietly.
5,Great,"Útil, yo personalmente lo use para agregarlo al disipador de una placa madre Gigabyte que Levantaba demasiada temperatura... no tengo quejas del producto.I use it to put in a Gigabyte motherboard, the heat is over with one of these... Great product"
2,Bought to replase a little bit noisy NSA-320 fan,And found out that this one is much noisier.Definitely would not recommend. There must be better fans on the market.
3,Works But Slightly Whines,"Works fine but whines slightly. Not annoyingly loud but slightly more than just fan noise. Quieter than the old one it replaced. Comes with a T3, 3 pin connector and adapter for 4 pin Molex. Overall, reasonable value at $8 and free shipping."
1,Smoke on the...,I plugged this thing into my WH-1 whammy pedal and my pedal started smoking. I hope this thing didn't fry my $500 pedal!
1,Out of stock,"After not receiving this for a couple weeks, I got an email saying they had refunded me. I'm assuming this was not in stock."
5,Digitech Power supply for Rp205,"It only took 5 days for delivery.It works perfectly for my RP 250, just like new:)"
4,Digitech AC Adapter,"The good: This product works well, though something that's easier to open and fix (in a pinch, such as during a gig) might be nice. Alternatively (and preferably), Digitech could add a battery compartment / battery to the RP300. That'd be very useful.The not so good (but not bad): I find the cable length a little short for some live set-ups, requiring more extension cables and power strips that need to be lugged around. 2 more feet would be great. The first one lasted about 2 years until the cable at the transformer box broke internally.Overall though, no serious complaints."
2,Worst of three Glacier hike books,"This one seemed like the friendliest and easiest to use, but it ended up being the most inaccurate, the worst organized, and the most incomplete. For example, one famous trail was described as ""easy"" and ""7.5 miles round trip."" In fact, it was 15 miles round trip; and describing 15 miles in any terrain, much less an alpine one, as 'easy' is a curious choice, and one I found myself grumbling about several times around miles 11 and 12.Erik Molvar's book proved to be far more trustworthy."
3,Not one of the best,"The Glacier Day Hike book includes most of the popular trails, and some less known trails. The description of the trails is good with some interesting information about biology and history. But there are some glaring mistakes. One trail is described as 17 miles long (round trip) and easy, but is actually only 6-7 miles (round trip).Trails are classified as easy, moderate and difficult. There is not information about elevation gain, and the classification at times seems a bit arbitrary as if different people had evaluated them.My two biggest complains are:1)No information about elevation gain.2)Trail heads at camp grounds and other developed areas were hard to find."
3,Was quiet at first,"I bought this clock two years ago, and it was very quiet at first. But now, in a quiet house, it sounds like a factory, and I don't want to be in the same room with it."
5,An extravagantly illustrated modern fable,"Bill Harley's Bear's All-Night Party is a children's book about the optimistic Bear who wants to throw a big celebration, despite the pessimism of the many other animals, who claim that ""no one will come."" It doesn't take long for Bear's dance, music, and song to catch on in this extravagantly illustrated modern fable about the importance of enjoying the moment. A lovely, lively picturebook superbly enhanced with Mellisa Ferreira's artwork."
3,Entertaining,"This was an interesting read, but I was looking for more on New England hauntings and ghosts so it wasn't exactly what I had been hoping for."
4,true tales of new england hauntings and horrors,"the book was interesting,not the type of book to read on a colddark rainy night.some of the tales were dated,but still of interest to me since i have lived in new england all my life"
5,Gripping,"Having been a native Vermonter and New Englander, I had not realized the ghostlore involved with this section of the country. Many of the stories occur within minutes of my own location. This book points out the origins and as much fact as can be researched. The end result is left with the reader as to which can be explained and that that which can not. Read this book alone at night and you will hear sounds that you used to take for granted, or did you?......"
5,I will never go outside again....its too scary!,"When you meet Joe Citro, he's cheerful and upbeat, and very benign. I had the opportunity to meet him when he talked to my high school english class. He scared us with a simple tale. And then I bought the book...... Had I known what kind of scary state, not to mention region, I lived in, I would have moved. But how bad can the rest of the country be? This is a great book, especially if you never want to sleep....I recommend reading it at a slumber party.....late, late at night!!!"
5,Last Noel by Michael Malone,Last Noel by Michael Malone I haven't started reading yet but it is on my kindle and I cannot wait to read it.
5,Such a Good Read,I read this book because it was Christmas and wanted something about the holidays. This is about the twelve days of Christmas throughout life of a white girl and a African American family boy who makes friends with Noni. His family lives in the helps house. They are born one day apart. Loved this book.
3,Good idea,"This book started out well and I enjoyed the characters. Noni was an easy to love character. I just found this to be so politically correct. I thought this book had merit and I was thankful for a few things. One Kaye stayed married. I never felt fully engrossed in the characters, that was the main thing lacking throughout the story. It is an easy read and not too boring just not great"
3,OK for a Christmas novelty book,"I admit to a mad passion for MOST of the work of Michael Malone, and was so sad to see he had succumbed to the temptation to write a ""christmas book"". I was so shocked I did not buy it- the only available Malone I don't own. Still, when my curiosity got the best of me in the library one day, I took it home and read it. And true to Malone's talent, it was readable and interesting and I got engaged by the characters and the perfect writing. Still, it isn't up to the standards of his best work (Try Foolscap or the Times Witness/Uncivil Seasons mysteries, for example) and I regret he didn't save the story for a deeper and less overtly commercial book. He's too good to be on a shelf with the likes of ""The Christmas Gift""."
1,Not A Christmas Story,"This book was very disappointing and depressing. I believed this was going to be an uplifting Christmas tale and was very disappointed. A story in the lives of a disfunctional family, Noni an unbelieving ""angel"" type character and a young black boy who spends 75% of the book being angry, sullen and unlikeable. Covering years of this strange relationship I have to admit the character I truly liked was Amma, one of the servants to the family. Even if it wasn't to be considered a Christmas story, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,A Wonderful Christmas Book,"Amid the presents, Christmas lights, hot chocolate and the smell of Christmas trees comes a story about a friendship that defies the racial norms in Moors, North Carolina in 1963. Kaye King first met Noelle Tilden on Christmas Eve, the night before her seventh birthday and Christmas. A perchance sleigh ride on the first night of snow, turns into an interracial relationship that spans thirty years. Never able to express their love for each in a racially divided world, Noni and Kaye live their separate lives while vowing to meet every Christmas Eve for a sleigh ride at Noni's family farm. Through the many twists and turns of life, their friendship stays strong and their love for each other endures. Noni and Kaye's story teaches us that the meaning of Christmas has nothing to do with physical gifts or differences, but is about the love that surrounds us--a love that outlives any obstacles."
3,Across My Rubicon Overview,"At some point in every person's life one's emotions and true self get pushed out of sight - hidden away from the outside world. For Cynthia Alexander this was not only her way of life but what she had to do to survive. Cynthia's seemingly heartless attitude made her perfect for managing the unmanageable, but she was not prepared for the dramatic impact this new job would have on her life.Enter Ted McBride, a cocky young programmer who would test Cynthia's patience and her capacity to mold him while maintaining her own professionalism. Everyday he pushed her closer to crossing the line and losing control. Neither of them was prepared for what was going to happen once they crossed their Rubicon."
5,I love this book!,"My takeaway from Julie Morgenstern book is that the first hour of the day , you work on the most critical task. The critical task is what either brings work money or save money. The trick is to do your list the night before so you don't save valuable time in the morning figuring out what to do. Also, I learn that you keep all the to do list I'm one place. And is extremely important to get balance in your life. You become more efficient if you have outlets in your personal life And Whenever, you get interrupted , write down an action on the project so is easy to get back to work. I really love this book, it talks about figuring out what project to work on, figuring how long it takes and ROI, return on the investment .I recommend this book."
1,Terrible book,"Poorly written, run on sentences and endless babbling. I could not get past his constant knocking of end over end knife throwing. He spent too much time on the short comings of end over end throwing and not enough time on the technique of his style. I guess he wanted to fill his book with pages so he ran on and on about irrelevant things. What was valuable in the book could have been written on 5 pages max."
3,"Good, but not what it's cracked up to be","I have used some of these ""combat throwing"" techniques for years. They are not revolutionary, they originate from ninjutsu spike shuriken throwing techniques. A few things regarding their use,1) Only effective really within nine feet.2) You actually can get enough power for serious penetration. I can stick an unbalanced knif an inch and a half into an oak door.3) Knife throwing in any form is not for killing, in a fight, its a distraction. Since you are ditching your weapon, you would be using the distraction to run.It is the best way I know of to throw knives though, and if you would be a proficient knife fighter I would recommend reading this book, but with skepticism."
5,Rest you hands and wrists,"While this keyboard might seem almost awkward at first, after a short time you become more familar with the ergonomic design, and your hands and wrists will benifit . . . not everyone will appreciate this design however, no matter how much they use it. In my opinion, this keyboard is probably as good or better than the Microsoft version because of things such as a large enter key and space bar(s). Works with any operating system - including Vista, and is smooth and quiet. Nice keyboard overall, I intend to use it for many years to come."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm not very happy with this purchase, The way it describes the emotions at times makes it seem confusing to a child, I was expecting a story book, Its actually just a small book with a sentence or two for each emotion, Would not purhcase from this author again"
5,Great book!,Daughter loves this book - she is 4. Great book for helping children to identify feelings and to talk about with parent.
4,I wanted the board book!,This was both of my children's first book to fall in love with. They both LOVE the voices and actions you can use while reading the book. It has really helped my just turned 2 year old understand emotions and how to define them! I bought a second copy for my niece and I was disappointed that it was not the board book with a bunch of additional emotions that are too subtle for a 2 year old. It's also not a robust enough book for the abuse of a 2 year old. If you skip the more subtle emotions it will be good for a toddler.
5,"Beautiful pictures, wonderful rhymes, important message","My 2.5 year old loves this book. It has beautiful pictures! It has creative rhymes! It has an important message! - To help children understand and identify their own feelings. Also to remind their parents and other caregivers that children have all these feelings at one time or another, but are still learning how to express them. We need to help them with that task. For emotional intelligence, a happy home relationship between kids & parents and success in life."
5,20 Month old son LOVES this book and so do I!,"I was thinking that it was time for a book about labeling and understanding feelings, so did a search and found this one. Just what I was looking for - and the text and pictures are as fun for me as for my 20 month old. My son loves to read and requests books one after another, but this was the first book he bounced up and down about reading over and over and over in one sitting, shouting, ""The Way I Feel! The Way I Feel!"" It was quite a reaction! We must have read it 30 times or more in the first 3 days. I imagined him thinking, ""Wow, this author really gets me!"" I have recommended it to friends and will give it often as a gift."
1,Board book misses half the feelings,"The regular hardcover version of this book is WONDERFUL. My five year old and I have been reading it together for two years, and now he loves to read it on his own.THIS IS NOT THE FULL VERSION!!We misplaced our well-worn Scholastic version, so I bought this board book. Today it arrived, and off the top of my head I can see that it's missing the sections on Thankful, Jealous, Bored, and Disappointed and Frustrated.I can understand having an abridged board book version for younger kids that doesn't include these subtler feelings, but that fact should be made clear. It's not mentioned in the book itself, so perhaps Amazon doesn't know about it.Needless to say, I'm disappointed and frustrated. I'll be returning this copy and ordering the full version."
5,Great Book!,My Son and I both loved this book. Great pictures and is easy to read. Great explinations of the emotions that every one feels. I would recomend this book for anyone with a frustrated child that needs words for what they are feeling.
3,Ok book,"Based on the reviews, I thought this book would knock our socks off... but I just found it to be an ok read. The story line is simple and the pictures are cute, but it's not one that my daughter will insist that I read over and over."
5,the way i feel,i liked this book because it showed many of the emotions I've had. This book had many colorful pictures. I liked the picture of the silly girl. It shows how a person can feel on different days. It showed me different ways to express myself when i feel like them.
5,Angels and Entropy,"A comforting and imaginative volume, Hilbert's latest collection includes ample servings from previous works. A trio of surreal prose poems, titled Barbie X 3, serves as an interlude connecting old and new work.The newest sequence both celebrates and mourns the transience of daily living and losing, with the persona's eye cast towards death and the afterlife--not only with dread, but with world-weary longing, even envy.###"
5,Depth of experience,"In recent years, listening to a variety of New England public radio jazz programs, every once in a while a recording by an obviously elderly lady named Elisabeth Welch would break through and take my attention away from my work. I hadn't heard her in perhaps ten years but her name remained in my memory. I knew nothing about her but was always curious so when I thought to enter her name in an Amazon search and came up with this CD, I instantly ordered it. With obvious jazz knowledge, she was more of a cabaret singer who lived a good portion of her very rich life in Paris, returning for engagements in New York when she was in her eighties. This is a recording of one of those performances, one I gnash my teeth over having missed. We are blessed to have this record of her voice, her experience, and her other gifts; gifts to those of us who care about American music."
5,Just think about it,"If you want to guess the outcome of this most unusual mystery, note that the title has two possible meanings. You mean . . . ? Exactly!"
1,Disappointment,"This book/CD set didn't help me at all. I listened to this several times and followed along with the book, but didn't learn anything. The only thing this program consists of is listening to conversations in Polish and reading along in the book. Nothing is explained in the book, it's just chunks of dialog. It wasn't hands on at all and was actually quite dry.I'm a hands on learner, though, so those who learn from being read to in a foreign language, have at it!"
2,Did not help,"I figured this would help my psoriasis, because some studies say that oatmeal soothes the dry scaly patches of psoriasis and eczema. This soap did not do anything but dry my skin up even more. Poor job at exfoliating."
1,Doesn't even deserve a star,"I thought this was a DVD with urban legends. I didn't think it was high budget, but I thought it was at least fairly new. Instead, it is seven super cheesy 1970s videos with really horrible comedic voice overs. The videos aren't even gory - they are obviously fake and stupid.When I first started the DVD, I thought maybe they had packaged the wrong thing in it. Nope. It is all stupid. Please, do not waste your money!"
2,Just didn't resonate with me,"I found very little ""warrior"" about this book unless you mean the stealth, meditating warrior within. Don't get me wrong, there are some really, REALLY good meditation exercises, but I found this book just scratching a surface and not ""meaty"" enough. I also found some of his ideas hard to grasp (five sided pyramid? It took me several minutes to realize that they only way that could be done is to lop off the top so there would then be a flat part & you could have that be a side...he never explains this) and he was extremely redundant. Also, his habit of summarizing every chapter at the end was very annoying - it reminded me of textbooks from school. I really loved his first book and have great admiration & respect for Mr. Cuhulain, but this book was just not my cup of tea. Wiccan, yes...but largely I felt more into Eastern Meditation & metaphysical concepts."
3,Too small,"Two issues. Not enou coverage I.e. too small. 2nd, it sometimes doesn't stick to the door as well as I would like it to stick."
2,Convection Oven Cooking,"Not enough basic recipes and not enough information. I returned this title, it just didn't appeal to me. If you want some more intricate recipes and some great basic convection oven info - try ""The Best Convection Oven Cookbook"". Personally, I'd like to see some one write a book with roasting times, chocolate chip cookie recipes and more of the basics."
2,A beginers guide,"A beginers guide to convection ovens. Some very basic receipts for everyday meals, but does not have receipts one might use when entertaining guests."
4,Good Book.,I thought it was a good book. It had a lot of suspence and it kept my attention throughout the whole book.
2,Too heavily edited!,"Like most reviewers I also agree that this series was the best cartoon adaption produced based on the L Frank Baum books. From the classic style of animation and brilliant theme ""Searching for a Dream""However these 'mini films' have been created by condensing between 18 (first book) and 14 (latter 3 books) 22 minute episodes into 93 minute films. Despite the fact most of the action is missing, the editing of it is extremely poor meaning the films do not flow properly and while watching the story feels obviously rushed.To be honest these should never have been released. Instead it should have been 4 individual boxsets/2 disc sets containing all 52 episodes. However if it's worth picking up if you want to see this version now and cannot wait for a complete set which may never happen.I gave this release 2 stars. One because I love this cartoon and the other because it's a boxset of all 4 films together in a set. A boxset of all 52 episodes would have received 5 stars."
2,NOT THE WHOLE SERIES,"A great childhood television series has been abridged in this boxed set. You just can't find the whole thing ANY where! So this is the next best thing to having the show you use to love. One reviewer wrote ""Close, but no cigar"" and they were right!"
1,business as usual,"Once again it seems all the discarded, poorly worded and confusing questions continue to make it in this edition of ""Core Review"". It adds a level of frustration and imparts a sense of impending failure to anyone attempting to study for the CCRN."
3,"Sophisticated humor, but perhaps a bit dated.","Much of the book is very funny. Perhaps you have to have a British (or Irish) background, rather than American, to really appreciate some of its finer points. A great deal of it is timeless - the British (particularly the English) have never really rid themselves of class distinction and Donleavy's genius hits home. But in many respects the culture has moved on and left some of his advice feeling dated and lacking the original humorous impact. My rating is based on my opinion of the effect on a reader in the year 2010 - probably much harsher than when originally published."
1,won't drink the coolaid twice,"Have the same problems with the VAIO latop battery, it just stopped working (the battery with the original laptop purchase). Logged on to Amazon with the intent to buy a new one, but was a) outraged by the price ($200 is 1/5 of the way toward a new laptop), b) convinced by the other reviews in this page that I would buy a battery with, likely, the same problems and life.Thanks, all, for putting in your prior reviews on the Sony Battery..."
2,Sony PCGA-BP71 battery,"I'm shopping for the battery -- what a rude awakening! The price seems pretty high. I'm disappointed with the battery that came with my Vaio. I usually keep the computer plugged in, using the battery as a back up. Now the battery will not take any kind of charge, even though it indicates only 29 charge cycles."
1,"Bad, bad battery! but we have no choice","A very poor quality battery indeed. Battery life is very low indeed, about half an hour. And then from 1 day to the next, after about a year (for us) it just stops charging. And then you find this ridiculously high price to buy a new one. Shame on you, Sony! but it's not like we can do anything about it, since our Vaio only takes this one battery. Nevertheless, very disappointing. Be warned before you buy a VAIO that uses this battery."
1,I'm not alone!,I thought I just got a bad battery with my Sony Vaio. It has been a great laptop with the exception of this stupid battery. Within 3 months it wouldn't hold a charge for longer than 10 minutes.Seeing these other reviews makes me realize I'm not alone. I feel your pain! I tried the Energizer brand but it was doa.I'm tempted to buy some cheap unknown brand. Can't be any worse than this Sony OEM.
1,Hurts your laptop's value,"This is a terrible battery. Mine now loses its recharge in about 15 minutes. I was so frustrated to discover the poor quality of this battery, and to realize that I don't have a laptop anymore, I have a paperweight. Shame on Sony, who sit by quietly and don't try to make amends to the owners of these batteries. I have already seen other, smaller quality problems with other Sony products, but now, for sure I won't be buying any Sony product again for fear of the little surprises like this that can skunk my investment."
3,authentic oracle but ...,"I spoke with my teacher, Khenpo Sherab Sangpo ([...]) and he was familiar with this divination system and has used it himself. But he also said that that to use it effectively one must have received a Manjushri empowerment and have completed various other practices so as to ripen one's mindstream. The editors of this book make no mention of the necessary empowerment or other preliminary practices.The concept of receiving an empowerment is alien to Western culture, but is central to Tibetan Buddhist practice."
4,Solid album still,Its been several years and I still find my self loving this album. I consider it more of a melodic death metal album. The melodies are very complete and very listenable to non death metal fans. Its still very heavy and not cluttered with pointless acoustic segments. Collective Demise has not gotten the credit it deserves through the years as it has stood the test of time in my collection. It is what melodic death metal is supposed to sound like.
5,Lightyear,This was the 1st Lightyear album on Householdnamerecords and is full of brass driven ska which will have you dancing all night. After a few plays you will be addicted to this band who have recently re-united for a British tour and appaerances at the Reading & Leeds festivals.
4,As interesting for parents as it is for their young people.,"Stephen Hahn did a remarkable job creating an adventure that rings true on many levels. The characters and settings are believable and the attention to detail remarkable. It was refreshing to learn more about what was happening on the homefront during the civil war, though the battle scenes were chillingly vivid. All in all it was a satisfying read."
3,OK but annoying keyboard,"Including work, this is my 4th Toshiba notebook and this is the first one I've regretted having. The right shift key is small and poorly located compared to the inverted ""T"" direction keys. Both Control keys are located ""off"" from other notebooks. It's been in service for over a year and I still haven't gotten used to shifting from at my desk with a USB dock to a real keyboard to the onboard keyboard on my lap. Three of the keys have become unreliable; that is, I press them but they don't register.Definitely bump the RAM up to 2Gb, especially if running Vista Aero.My teenager runs a wide variety of games on it without performance complaints. But there's no way he'll take this to college, as lugging 7+ pounds, 9+ including the adapter, all day is a non-starter."
5,AWESOME!!,What a great looking case! The colors of the flames are vibrant and perfect for my son! The size is awesome and the material is very sturdy. Great job!
1,"Professional Development with Web APIs : Google, eBay, Amazon.com, MapPoint, FedEx",I believe this book was not written with the developer in mind. Its was scimpy in detail and I had to return it. It is .net based and may be not suitable for java developer.
5,A MUST-READ FOR SERIOUS INVENTORS,"Patent Pro Se will save many times its cost in attorney's fees, as it clearly addresses the basic legal parameters, terminology and strategies that must be employed by the successful inventor. Included is a provisional filing checklist, cover sheet and even a return postcard, as well as fee transmittal and patent assignment forms, a non-disclosure agreement, and samples of product sell and patent license letters. If that's not enough, Patent Pro Se also includes samples of patent applications and an actual issued patent, an addressed envelope, two compact disks, an Inventor's Notebook and a three-ring binder to keep everything organized. I found the CDs especially helpful, as I was able to hear the text of the manual while driving around town between appointments. Very convenient and informative."
5,Highly recommended step-by-step guide to file a PPA,This book explains in a concise and effective way the patent laws and filing process. It is an invaluable tool for the entrepreneur who wants to protect her idea during the product development phase. The book describes how to prepare a Provisional Patent Application and file the documents with the USPTO. The book contains a lot of good examples of dos and don'ts and all forms you must fill to file your PPA. It even includes the envelope to send the express mail! I completed my process in less than a week and I have already received back my filing number from the USPTO.
4,"Good value, good product","My new and extremely heavy Stiga table came with a net set that would be ridiculous even for the cheapest table, so I ordered this set as a replacement. It's the least expensive fully adjustable set I found, and I'm satisfied with it. The net tension chains are easy to set up and use. My only objection is the tendency of the post height adjusters to relax after aggressive play, so check the net height often."
2,pretty skimpy,"I was very disappointed when I received this book; I was expecting something more substantial. Although the text is well researched, it is more a compendium of facts about women and the death penalty, rather than a case study of individual women who have been executed. There are only a few captioned photos in the middle of the book, and you're left trying to guess who the women pictured on the jacket were. Instead of buying this I would strongly suggest Texas Death Row, which has photos and facts about every executed man, and is much less."
5,Stunningly Shabby Chic!,"The mom-to-be just loved this buggy. I used it as a cake topper on a two tiered cake with cupcakes surrounding, it was beautiful.It is a bit smaller than I imagined but I love it!Thank you"
2,"Tedious, very disappointing.","I have tremendous respect for Martin Duberman as a writer and as a gay rights activist. CURES is a seminal account of one gay man's attempt during the 50s and 60s to use therapy to ""cure"" himself of his homosexuality. It's a telling account of the times, offering younger readers like myself the opportunity to see just how intolerant and oppressive our society was of homosexuality. It's insightful memoir at its best. Instead, this book is self-involved and tedious, a whiney account of various squabbles between academics during the 70s on how best to achieve gay liberation and acceptance. It fails to offer insightful commentary on larger issues, and is therefore meaningless for most readers. Martin Duberman has done gay history and all of us a great service by writing such brilliant works as CURES and STONEWALL. I only wish he would return to chronicling the larger history of gay people so eloquently."
3,when all is said and done....,"I'm afraid that Martin Duberman has a few problems with himself, in spite of being 'good looking'and busy with a therapist. Mr. Duberman has demonstrated that he is both a challenge to heterosexist white male ideology and yet a servant to it. There has been a curious lack of radicalism in his writing for the Nation, and I suspect he has simply become another academic worshipper at the Western Civ. fount of double-talk. While some of us continue to challenge these offensive paradigms, Duberman is more interested in retailing startlingly dull stories about academics who are not on the cutting edge of radicalism. As a feminist and lesbian activist, I expect more courage (and more interest!) in a book by Duberman, who has written well in the past. Not this time; perhaps he will finally move aside, and allow those of us who challenge the white male agenda of hatred on all fronts to come to the fore. I certainly hope so."
5,Great Product!,The ordered book arrived in just three days and in perfect condition for an used item.Great service and value!
5,You Can't Go Wrong...,Immensely enjoy all of the Kingdom and Knights of Arrethtrea series.Always waiting for the next one to come out. Only series that I can RELISTENto and enjoy each time.
1,Not happy,"I was going to refrain from writing this comment but decided to tell it as I felt.Whenever I have bought used books on the web and they are described as used, nearly new, I have found them to be in almost perfect condition. In this case I was disappointed. I feel that the description should have been more exact and said that the last page was torn out, and there was scribbling on the cover. At least it was the correct copy."
5,In depth study of Slave Badges,"This book delves into the true history of slave badges. The authors research uncovers and reveals the numbers of slave badges made in each year, who made the badges, the types of badges, what each year of badge looked like as to what an authentic badge should have on it for each year, what the badges were made from, why the badges were made and used, how they were used, etc. There are many color plates showing the badges, and designs. Some of the photos of badges are a bit small, but other than that, I had no complaints about the book...it is the seminal work on slave badges of Charleston."
4,Great for little kids!,"This little activity book is great for little kids. I bought this to add to a teacher collection, however I misinterrpreted the title and thought ""JUNIOR"" was for older kids...but really it is for LITTLE kids. The MadLibs have picture matching deals so there is no question about what is an adjective, noun, verb, etc."
5,Simply Woman!,"Very happy with my purchase. Arrived in timely manner and in great condition!! Would recommend them to anyone!!I love it when you get exactly what they describe....I have gotten books in the past they pass off as ""like new"" that AREN'T in good condition, they have excellent quality!!"
5,Stepping Stones to Recovery,"Very comprehensive easy-to-read book for a recovering alcoholic. Is arranged nicely, and many helps which are easy to read."
2,disappionting cd,Purchased these CDs off ebay and was so sorry. They are literallya waste of money. Most songs are scratchy and all are low quality. Recorded as if right off a record. The number of Cdsand songs may make it seem like a good deal but most songs areunder 3 min. Would'nt recommened.
2,My husband wouldn't buy it again.,My husband (a retired general contractor)bought this system to build a storage shed for his garden tractor and equipment. He wanted something to make building a gambrel roof easier. This has been a frustration and disappointment for both of us. The brackets are too thin to keep the system from flexing and bending when trying to install each stud and rafter assembly.
4,The tables are turned.,"In this book, the tables at last are turned. In the past, Cathy always wanted Irving to propose. When she brought it up, he ran. Here the tables are turned. When Alex, her young beau, actually gives her the one thing she always wanted from a man, a ring, she herself runs.Whether it is dealing with men, her dog, her work or her relationship, Cathy's insecurities, as well as her ""why aren't you married"" yet mother, who is like her in many ways, Cathy, continues to tickle our funny bone.Try it you won't be disapointed."
2,Not real great,"Aside from the competent performances of Douglas Jimerson and Jill Worley, the singers and musicians on this CD are rather poor. But the recording is worse - poor quality, and done in such a way as to emphasize defects in the presentation. Whenever David Calib comes in with the drums, everything else is drowned out. Did they put the mike _in_ the drum? Sounds like it. The best numbers were those with Jimerson soloing with only a piano backup. It was therefore very disappointing to hear ""All Quiet Along the Potomac"" as a trumpet/drum instrumental. All this is not to mention the quibble that the album's connection with Robert E. Lee is a bit strained. Aside from ""How Firm a Foundation,"" most of the songs have very little to do with Lee aside from the fact that his family might conceivably have had the sheet music lying around the house, or they were popular during/after the wars he took part in. Be that as it may, I'm sorry to say that three-quarters of the CD is barely listenable."
2,If I had to do it over again...,"If I had to do it over again... I would not choose to go with the Fast Framing kit. While it does serve its purpose, I feel it is just as easy (and cheaper) to make the appropriate angled cuts (because you will be doing major carperty work to craft a door (at least if you want it done right) anyway. On a positive note, it does work and provides fairly simple instructions to get your shed up in reasonable time."
4,Exactly as described,"Great product, description is very clear except they should post the materials list. It will cost about $1000+ to get all the material just to frame it out and put up walls. That doesn't include paint, etc."
1,better off framing the regular way,"Would have been much easier just to frame the shed the normal way, which I eventually did. The fast framer wasn't so fast."
5,Red Dawn Movie,"Great Product, arrived on time and was exactly as described. Would recommend and will definitely deal with this business in future!!!"
4,Red Dawn,"Red Dawn is a classic! Patrick Swayze, God bless him, excelled in this cold-war saga even as a young man and early in his career. This is a film that is not only fun to watch but a film you will want to see many times in the future!"
2,Plastic drywall mount breaks before fully inserted,"I'm going to take a chance using only the screws to install this, as the drywall mount ripped in half as I screwed it into the wall, per the instructions. I'll be moving the entire hanger up slightly to cover up the inch-wide hole in my wall, complete with half a mount stuck inside. :)"
4,Great Way to Care for Your Guitar,"I was looking for a way to store my Bass out of the way without putting it on a floor stand (the room is small and it would be one more thing to try and not trip over). Now that I have it hanging on the wall, it's not only safe from my lumbering feet, but makes a wonderful ""work of art"".I've had it on the wall for three weeks now with no sign of the fittings or hanger loosening. The hanger I received seems to be along the lines of an oak, stained a medium tone and very well finished with no rough spots or splinters. The hook that actually holds the instrument's neck is a rubberized metal and blends in nicely with the Bass."
3,"Fine, but they sent the wrong one","The one they sent me is pretty clearly meant for an electric: uneven bars and less padding than the version I had before. Not a big deal, but their mistake"
5,"Worked like a charm, crucial product if you need the space.","These do their job well. It's a simple design, a block of wood with two screws. Yet what sets these apart from others is that the quality is high. The hanger is quite heavy feeling. Wood grain is pretty. It's an incredible value. I got two of them for around $18 with free shipping..It also gives you some piece of mind knowing that your guitar is on the wall and not able to be knocked into on the floor. I have nicks in mine from them falling or my chair hitting them.Not to mention.. it's quite sharp looking to have a couple guitars mounted on a wall in a room.. aesthetically appealing... yet totally serving a purpose.. if you play them that is.I would highly advise a stud only install.. not worth the risk.."
4,It's definitely a guitar hanger,"Well, what else is there to say about something that just holds on to your guitar until you are ready to use it? The construction is fairly solid and does its job well. I wouldn't recommend trying to hang a cello from it. (Not that you would, but...)"
4,"Great, unless you have a classical guitar","THis hanger seems great, except that I have a classical guitar with a wider neck, so it doesn't work for me."
5,Perfect wall hanger for my classical acoustic guitar,This guitar hanger is easy to install with the screws provided. My classical acoustic guitar hangs securely cushioned and is easy to engage and disengage and the price is right.
4,Modifying mounting to suit,"Too long for electrics so drilled my own 1/4 inch hole above given one and into sheetrock, which allowed arm to fit flush and secure on mount, without plastic spacer."
4,"yoke not adjustable, but still works","I ordered this product to use with both a guitar and a banjo. The yoke is not adjustable, but it's still the right size to work with either instrument. Also, I ordered the basic version pictured here, so it did not come with padded rings.The sturdy drywall anchors require two huge holes in the wall, and I had trouble with blunting them on concrete behind the drywall on an exterior wall - better to mount to a stud if you have one near the right location. (You could cheat and use the little drywall anchors, but then it's just a matter of luck whether your guitar stays up or comes clanging to the floor.The hanger itself is not particularly interesting or attractive looking, but it seems inconspicuous with an acoustic guitar or banjo hanging from it. If you have an artistic electric guitar, you might want something that matches it a little better, but this is great for my needs."
4,feedback on guitar wall hooks,"first of all, they work great and the hardware you need to install into drywall is included. no drilling necessary. i have just 2 suggestions for improvement: i ordered a number of them and not one of them has the same wood finish as another. they are light, dark and medium in color, even though i thought they would all be the exact same. Not a big deal, the guitar hides 95% of what you see. The second thing is that they are not easy to get level, and a template for where the screw holes should be would be helpful as well.all and all, i like them and will order more as my guitar collection grows."
5,A Must Needed Product For ALL Musicians,"If your instrument is always in your way or more importantly other peoples way, you must have this wall hanger. It works so well and is structured so well, you hardly know it's in your studio!"
3,Doesnt seem sturdy enough.,"Well, overall it seems like a decent quality product. I used the provided plastic anchors on a wall w/o studs.Other reviewers say the anchors break easily...but they won't break if you know what you're doing. So far so good. However, the actual metal screws that hold the hanger onto the wall do not screw well into the plastic anchors and it feels like they are just sort of RESTING inside the anchors rather than being really SCREWED into the anchors. I will give this a try with my 8lb bass guitar (max recommended limit is 15lb) and really hope I don't end up regretting it."
5,Very Sturdy and good looking!,"These are really nice looking hangers. Currently they're holding two of my acoustics and my electric guitar. Very well made and sturdy. As I get more space, I'll be getting more of these!"
3,nice but don't match,"I ordered three of these to hang my guitars from. They came packaged nicely, are all well made, work great, etc. The problem is that the woods don't match. Each of the three has the wood stained a different shade. And not just a little different. If you need more than one, it may be better to buy these in a store so you can visually match the wood."
5,Saved me a ton of space!,"The 'ol studio room looks cleaner now. I trust them, as I chose to install them into studs. I'd probably be alright with sticking them straight into the wall, but just chose not to. The look great, too! Simple and fast to install, took a matter of minutes to install 5 of them."
3,"Really good, but.......",This is a really nice item and I got two of them. Unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and I had to force it which has created a little wobble. That's the problem with mail order. Sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it. Oh well so far its working OK with the my old classical (beater) guitar I have hanging on the faulty one. The other unit seems to be rock solid. Oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar.
5,Solid,"Overall a great, sturdy product. I have no concerns about my axes hanging from the wall with this product. I will say that they work best with a guitar that has tuning pegs all located on 1 side (e.g. a Strat) vs a guitar where the tuning pegs are split on each side. This is a very minor point but one of tuning pegs is touching the arms that hold the guitar."
4,String Swing Guitar hanger,"My husband ordered 4 of these. I know that the discription says ""shades may vary""...we got 3 in a light walnut shade and 1 of them was a dark brown. You would think that if its all the same order then they would send all one color. Oh well. When all the guitars are hung up you can hardly tell. It was really easy to install and they look great."
5,Just what I needed!,This guitar hook comes with quality hardware--the best drywall anchor I've ever used. It's easy to mount and sturdy.
4,On line shopping problem,"I bought this hanger for my mandy; it is going to work fine. I have three hangers, one has a flat black metal back I like better.BUT I BOUGHT THIS ON LINE TO SAVE A SMALL TRIP TO THE GUITAR STORE. 123 Music company packed this small itemm in a huge box that the US Mail would not leave in my box.So I had to get in the car and drive to the post office and stand in line. After shipping ect. I saved no money and got my ----- busted too."
5,Yes to the String Swing,Exactly what I needed. Works equally well for both acoustic and electric. EASY to hang with all the hardware included. LOVE the extra floor space now that the traditional guitar stands are put away!
3,Okay...for acoustics,Listen up everyone....This wall hanger is good for acoustic guitars only! I just dont trust it enough to hang a heavy solid body electric on it.I think the outside diameter on the screws that came with it were made to metric tolerances. This makes them just a little bit undersized so you might want to get some more screws made a little bit thicker. Besides that this is an OK hanger but like I said dont hang anything that has a lot of weight on it or you might be sorry!
5,sturdy,"Worked perfectly and easy to install. My only issue was that I ordered 10, and they weren't all the same color."
5,Works great,Works great. Not much to say other than it works.Mounts easily to wall and holds guitar well without scratching it.
4,Works great.,"Works great. Everything is fine. just eating up words. really, its fine. like it. six more words. and we are done."
5,Perfect Guitar Hanger,"Outstanding. I recommend to anyone who wants to hang their guitars on the wall and have it look nice. Very solid indeed. I mounted right into where the studs are behind the wall and its not moving. I think these are a solid enough that I wont worry that one of my expensive guitars would fall off the wall. I bought 4, now I'm buying 2 more so I can hang them all."
5,Looks nice and sturdy. A space saver.,"I bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room. It looks really good, almost like an ornament. It sturdy and good quality. 5 stars."
3,I just got my order...,"This is NOT a review about how well these work, because I haven't tried it out yet. But a review of Amazon fulfillment...I understand the title says ""Shades may vary."" I took that to mean I didn't get to pick a color. Fine- I checked on the manufacturer's site and noticed they come in 4 colors, oak, maple, cherry, etc. I have enough variation of wood on my house that I didn't need to match a specific color to the rest of my furniture.However, I ordered 2, that are intended to go next to each other on the wall.When I received them today, I got two different colors! I understand they probably have a huge wholesale box of a jumble of these in an Amazon warehouse somewhere, but the person who packed my order could have put two that match in the same box. It will just look dumb with pieces of mismatched wood on the wall next to each other."
4,can't get it in the wall with those huge plastic things!,those wall anchors provided are way too huge! I'm having to use basic screws to get it stuck to the wall.
4,Will hold a fender strat but it is almost too wide.,"hold my martin fine, and it holds the fender strat too, but it is almost too wide to hold it. But it does fit!!!"
3,Great hanger but poor screws,These hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws. The screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so I would recommend you buy some good screws before you install. I have several of these and at least three screws broke as I screwed them into the stud in the wall.
2,Not deep enough...,"The deep impact socket set is fine. The plastic jacket on one was cracked when it arrived, but was quickly replaced by the seller.The socket wasn't quite deep enough to completely tighten the lug nuts down on my friends BMW 550i snow tires/wheels. It kept hitting the edge of the wheel and scratching it (not exactly what why I bought the protected versions...) I took the plastic sleeve off and was then able to fully torque the lug nuts down.They are cheap, made kinda cheap and eventually get the job done after scratching your rims so be carefull."
1,NONSENSE,This book teaches children that dinosaurs were in the garden of eden. Rediculous. Why dont we teach our children science based FACT instead?
2,Wording is a bit... off,We were given this book as a gift and I was a bit more than surprised. The wording was more than a little... scary. I felt the author was stretching trying to find something for certain letters and his decision was more than a giant flop. We ended up giving it away and hope that the next owner is able to enjoy it more than we were.
5,Excellent learning tool!,We love all of Ken Ham's books and this is no exception! An excellent tool in teaching children about God's Word.
1,P is for Psycho,"Flipping through this book I found it to be yet another disturbing study in ""making history into whatever you want it to be"" just by writing it. It teaches children basically a pack of garbage that can not be verified by any scientific principle of any sort. Brainwashing young children into believing this filth, Ken Ham you are a monster. Your books are paranoid reactionary lunacy revolving around the ""Darwinian conspiracy"" which by the way doesn't exist. Darwinian racism? Darwinian socialism? Darwin was a scientist not a public offical or a philosopher. He used scientific method to support his theories. Ham you are either a nutt, or just one more money grubbing fiends that are out to make a buck on peoples lack of education. Nuff said!"
2,Not what I expected!,I bought this book for my children's school as a gift for their teachers for an end of the year. Did not realize it was based on God ??
1,The opposite of educational,"An educational book is one that helps children learn about about the world, and/or helps them learn to think logically so they can learn for themselves in the future. In this case there is one simple fact that makes this book entirely the opposite of educational: the Bible does not have anything to tell us about dinosaurs.In the same way that ancient people made up stories to explain things they didn't understand, the author mas made up information about dinosaurs because he doesn't understand (perhaps willfully) science, the concept of scientific consensus or the logical process which is the scientific method. If you want your child to learn real facts about dinosaurs, get a book informed by science (which is how we learn about the world)."
1,Like teaching kids flat-earth is a better theory.,"Teaching kids that people co-existed with dinosaurs is like teaching them that the earth is flat. Makes for a fine story as far as fiction is concerned, but I fear that many parents will read it to their children as non-fiction. There are not two sides of this debate. There is no debate. There is a reason why 99.99% of all scientists in the related fields oppose the young earth hypothesis and why there has never been a SINGLE young earth paper that has withstood the scrutiny of peer review. If you really think that there is a real scientific debate about this, it is only because you know next to nothing about biology, geology, biogeography, paleontology, evolution and the scientific method. Why would you teach your kids something you don't understand?"
3,Disappointing,"I was looking on a resource on daily life in Victorian America. This seemed like the perfect find. Upon getting it home however, I was badly disappointed. Sprinkled with the dryest English wit imaginable, it is essentially the story of a regular person. Apart from her distinguished company, there is little of interest in her life. She travelled frequently, but only did the same thing in other countries as she did in her own - attended cocktail parties, operas, balets, balls and the like. It is reminiscent of the peaceful chapters in War and Peace. On and on, in droning monotone, event after tedious event is described to her somehow interested mother. It does say one thing about rich Victorians: they were boring!"
2,Such poor writing,"This book is one of the worst written I have ever encountered. The ideas and concepts are interesting--the title and the photos are inviting. But the breezy style that wastes so much space on insignificant detail of the authors travels is just space filler. And the grammatical and spelling mistakes are just unforgiveable. I just cannot read something that has multiple, numerous mistakes throughout the book--you cannot escape them, and they are so blatant and numerous that the detract from thinking about the subject matter."
1,A few lost cities and a lot of rubbish,I read this looking for more information on the various sites but was greatly disappointed. There is some description of several sites along with a lot of wild speculation and questionable history. About a third way through the book changes into an wandering very stupid hitch hiking travelogue of South America. Describing how he got lucky with a girl in a bar is not a monumental event.A sorry waste of time and money.
2,I did not like it.,I wanted to understand everything on Generics and finished the book with only a few new concepts...
1,I give this book 5 negative stars,"This book sucks, the author seems to have written this book without first getting a thorough understanding of Generics himself.I read 3 chapters, this book was so frustrating that I stopped after 3 chapters. You are better off reading a C# reference that does a couple of chapters on Generics. You'd learn more than what this book teaches you."
4,Best book on this subject,".NET generics are very valuable addition to .NET framework with 2.0 and this book provides detailed information about generics and container issues. As a long time STL user, typed containers brought a lot of value to the framework .I started to be aware of Power Collections library after this book and used in some projects. I would suggest this book to anyone without hesitation."
5,Best EVER!,"I got a sample size of this product in the Mama Mio mother's kit (I forget the exact name) and I decided to try it on my belly button as it stretched out towards the middle/end of my pregnancy. I fell in LOVE and had to buy the full size.This rich ointment does not leave a sticky mess. It absorbs quickly and really WORKS. My skin is left INCREDIBLY soft, and bonus - the only stretch marks I have this pregnancy, are the stretch marks left over from my first. No new ones!!! That to me is proof alone this stuff is amazing.I also have used it on my elbows, on eczema, around my nose during a horrific cold - all with the same amazing results.Cannot recommend this highly enough.Bonus: It smells yummy, like honey/beeswax. (Super subtle, not a strong scent!)"
2,The vocal part is totally missing from this Carmina Burana Suite,"The vocal part is totally missing from this Carmina Burana Suite. When I bought it, I was not paying attention. What a mistake! Can you imagine Beethoven's Ninth Symphany without the vocal part?"
2,More an Autobiographical Account than Support of a Theory,"Mr. Koppel is a skillfull prose writer, but the facts, theories and evidence in his book are interspersed few and far between. This makes it easy and fun to read, but left me starving for the archeological meat and potatoes that I had bought the book for in the first place.So, to those who enjoy reading themselves to sleep to well-written travel narratives with stories of mild adventure, I do recommend ""Lost World"". But, those just interested in a fact-filled presentation of the ""before Clovis, by boat"" theory of the peopling of the Americas and its supporting evidences will likely be disappointed with this book. To them I recommend instead the book ""Bones, Boats and Bison."""
3,A Prehistory History,"Both a good summary of past ideas about the peopling of America, and a hands-on viewpoint of several specific searches. Unfortunately omits needed maps, index, and bibliography. Good for a first-time reader in the subject, with archeologists named (within the text) for further reading."
1,waste of money,buy the stuff separate the company is drawing you in with their name you can buy all of this and more for less and i even got a capacitor with the set i bought trust me there is not difference with the wire go buy your wire at walmart or meijer or what ever department sort in your area that sells car audio buy the same sizes of wire just by a no name brand your dropping alot of money on your car audio dont waste it on the wires
1,not properly packaged- cannot use,"This cart comes without any protective packaging (it's sent in a cardboard box that fits the folded cart exactly- no padding, no protective layer, not even any sturdy cardboard corners to keep the flimsy box from collapsing), so of course it is bent when it arrives and you can't use it. If it had arrived in good condition, it probably would have been a decent cart, but I wouldn't take my chances on that (am ordering a replacement from a different company)."
1,bummer,"Looks great, wonderful size, perfect if it only stayed together... worked for a few days before the front wheels fell off and a few weeks before the rear wheels fell off."
1,Don't buy this cart. You will be sorry,"This cart is too small. The Target stores didn't have them anymore. Not that easy to put together. And can see why the wheels don't stay on with what they are put together with. Another retailer had the same one for less. By the time I paid tax, shipping and handling this cart was more. I don't have a car so the only reason I ordered it online. I really like Target but this was a great disappointment. I put the cart back in the box. It would do if I only needed a small cart. This won't hold much of anything. If I can't get a way to take it to the store will be out the money. I read how to put it together but makes no sense to me. Target you need to do better than this. The ones you sold in your stores were big. But they fell apart too."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this cart and I'm sorry I wasted my money. The instructions are not clear as to how to lock the wheels in place, and as a result the whole cart fell apart when I had my groceries in it. When I finally got it together correctly, it did not prove to be sturdy. It is wobbily and does not roll right. I don't suggest buying it."
1,Bad product-and poor shipping material,This came with an opened box. Wrong size...and would be very difficult and more money to return. DO NOT BUY from company!!!
3,My Order,"I liked the idea of this item, but my issues were:The handle should be adjustable for taller people.The wheels should pivot; it's not easy trying to get the loaded cart up metal stairs.The back panel should be higher so that when you tilt the cart, your items won't fall out.It seems sturdy enough, that hasn't been a problem."
4,"Very sturdy, some pieces keep coming off though...","My husband cut the tops off to shorten the height and put the two accross pieces back onto the shortened legs. This is to accomodate holding a DJ box instead of a keyboard height. The rubber skid stoppers keep sliding off, which is annoying, and the end plugs fall out and we already lost two, otherwise it's a heavy, sturdy stand."
2,"Lots of examples, but not many helpful solutions","I was looking for some help witha troublesome mother-in-law relationship, and this one had some good reviews. I was fairly disappointed by it though.First, the book offered a number of real-life examples, but the arrangement of these stories into seprate chapters seemed a little unclear to me--I found it hard to locate the sections that might be most helpful for my specific situation.The second problem I had with the book is that the author apparently has no training in psychology or family therapy--according to the author bio she teaches screenwriting. So, she presents a lot of examples, but the ""solutions"" are not really solutions, but rather just statements of what the results of a particular situation are likely to be. I was looking for more concrete solutions."
1,Mother-in-lawsAnd Daughter-in-laws,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It is written in the style of a 6th grades outline. Each section provides specific relationship problems between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law and how it effects the son. Then it gives you a very short simple suggestion for what should be done. The problem is if you don't fit in to one of these very specific relationships the information is useless.Very boring to read also, a waste of time and money."
3,"Well-presented, complete menus","This is a good reference for non-typical burgers; some recipes (the Wahoo Burger, the Mansion Roadhouse Burger, Sweet Potato Fries to name a few) are superb, others are only marginal. The photos are great, full of color and detail that correctly highlights the food. One aspect I enjoyed is the way the recipes are grouped and presented in complete menus."
2,Poor sound quality,The poor quality of this recording spoils the performance. It was recorded at various concerts in Germany in the 40's and 50's. Audience members are clearly heard coughing and clearing their throats. I do not recommend this recording.
3,such a waste of paper,"First of all, this book explained UWB well as other reviewers described ...The most annoying thing is that more than half of the book are just pure Matlab codes (hey, it is not a book of Matlab). I do not see any reason why these codes should be printed - instead, a CD will be much more preferable.It is a good idea to have some checkpoints. However more than half of the non-Matlab-codes-contents are Matlab-related checkpoints (wow, Matalb again), which is kind of weird.Probably a good book for those who need step-by-step instructions. Highly NOT recommended for those who have a good background in communications (especially those who have experiences converting mathematical formulas into Matlab codes)."
2,Perhaps a book for a course on UWB,"The book was disappointing. It certainly does not help me understand UWB radio fundamentals. However, it might be usefull for certain UWB courses that might be taught somewhere (which I would not like to attend either). It follows the growing practice of pretending that radio design (in general and UWB radio in particular) is just a matter of matlab code and figures."
5,The Lord Is My Shepherd: Why Do I Still Want?,This book is a must read for anyone who has suffered loss in their life. It is an invaluable guide to using the power of Psalms for healing the void. Rabbi Plotkin uses very personal stories to demonstrate how the book of Psalms contains ancient wisdom that is as relevant today as it was two thousand years ago.
4,Psalms for the 21st Century,"Rabbi Plotkin has brought forth the principle that the Psalmists were not writing for their time, or for our time, but for all time. Through his own personal spiritual experience and deep belief, he is able to impart to the reader an insight to the aptness of the poems we know as The Book of Psalms. I wouldn't call the concept exactly uplifting, but a good place to turn, whatever one's frame of mind or level of spirituality."
2,Not authors,"A choice excerpt:""The best way to start writing a class is to decide what you want it to do. For this, a Python-based modelof refrigerator behaviors, Fridge, is the first thing, and it should be basic. While you're thinking aboutit, focus on what you will need a particular Fridge object to do for your own purposes. You wantenough behaviors available that this object can be used to make food, yet you don't want to worry aboutaspects of real-life refrigerators that won't be included in a simplified example, such as temperature, thefreezer, defrosting, and electricity--all of these are unnecessary details that would only complicate ourpurpose here. For now, let's just add to the docstring for the Fridge class to define the behaviors thatyou will be building soon.""Did an editor even look at this?"

4,Andrea does it again!,"This was a great historical romance. I love Andrea, and I am glad that she has finally a book set in the states. Dane and Jacqui are really likeable characters, and I loved the kitten ""whiskey"". Set during the Revelutionary War, Dane and Jacqui follow there hearts and beliefs. Jacqui is daring and not a fainting miss. Dane is the hero of every girls dreams.If you love Andrea you will love this book. Andrea has not let us down with this one."
4,Masque,"I really appreciate Andrea Kane's writing style. Her stories are colorful and very realistic. She keeps the stories rolling along with her wit and humor.One ""little deception"" can land a Duke in the Parson's Trap quicker than steamy kisses with a beautiful virgin."
3,"Good book, just not my setting","I prefer Andrea Kane's English settings to the american ones, just personal preference. But if you enjoy the revolutionary time period from America's perspective, then you will love this book. I highly recommend Ms. Kane's books my two favorites are Wishes in the Wind and the Emerald Garden, both of which I gave 4 and a half stars."
1,No manual and no markings.... Can't install,"The gauge came with no manual and no markings on the back to tell you what wire goes where.The oil pressure gauge has 3 bolts for wires. I know from my previous gauge that the middle one is to the oil pressure sending unit, but the left and right ones can be either negative or positive. Since I've already blown one because mine wasn't stock and the positive and negative were reversed, I don't want to hook this up until I know what goes where. How hard would it be to mark the back of the gauge for easy hookup?"
2,Practically Tasteless,"I like products like Instant Breakfast, Slim Fast, etc. and thought this one would be similar. It has an incredibly thick and grainy texture and not much taste at all. I will try to finish, after all, I paid $$ for it, but I will have to hold my nose as I try to swallow!! If you are going to try this product, I recommend asking the club manager for a sample before making an investment."
1,Didn't like taste at all,The taste was terrible and this product has an artificial sweetener in it that I wasn't aware of. I wish I would have paid attention to one of the previous reviews.
1,HORRIBLE,Burned out two days after having it. Never had a problem with these before I am not sure if we just got a bad one or what.
3,Another film I'm glad I rented,"This film tells its story reasonably well; the acting is pretty good; production is good, etc.; however, somehow I never found myself fully engaged. The premise seems reasonable enough: David, the Successful Gay Artist-working-as-a-waiter to put him in touch with regular people again and so recharge his creativity as an artist. Also an infatuation between a gay man and a straight man, whether reciprocated or not, is also believable. But somehow, with this cast or with this script, the film doesn't resonate. Granted, it *could* happen, but David seems far too together to fall for Matt."
3,Good Story Lacking Something,"Perhaps it is heart. The story isn't bad, the acting isn't bad, and the production values were impressive. Everyone in the movie, though, seems bent on self-destruction, from the gay guy who knows he can't have the ""straight"" guy, the ""straight"" guy's wife (who sends her husband happily into the gay guy's arms,) and the ""straight guy,"" who is hard to sympathize with because he just seems eager to please himself without regard to anyone else. I didn't love the supporting cast, and the end left me unsatisfied. A bit too much straight sex and far less gay sex didn't encourage me.Tone down the sex (it wasn't interesting) and give the characters some redeemability, and this piece would earn at least one more star.Worth seeing in a pinch, but not the best. (...)"
2,Could have been so much better!,"The best thing about this movie was Vincent Corazza. Working with crappy dialog and a plot that tackled too many issues, he did a fantastic job expressing his character's confusing emotions without the need for words. This movie would have been really great had it stuck to the primary plot of a relationship between a married heterosexual man and a gay man. The main plot should have dealt soley with the bisexual issue and concepts of love, rather than bring in HIV, transgendered issues, fatal illnesses, dealing with the death of friends, euthanasia, etc.Like so many 'gay' themed movies out there, it is morbid, sad, and filled with pain and suffering. Plus it deals with so many psychological issues that viewers tend to get lost and can't connect with any of the characters. Could have been much better. It's worth a look though, for Vince Corazza."
2,The Metropolis Mixer,"This movie is so mixed with good points and bad that when the movie is finished you really feel nothing for the characters. The bodies and faces of the actors are beautiful, stunning in fact, but what lies beneath is a heaping mess. David, the gay painter, is so consumed with himself (as his friend is dying) and Matt (the husband) is stumbling with his sexual idenity crisis that in trying to find himself he destroys others in his wake. The only real character that shines, but briefly, is Violet (the wife) who gives us a small glimpse of a woman that is betrayed and caught in a bewildering situation which she has no real way to vent her fustration. Overall the paintings and beautiful people are nice to look at, but the overacting by David and Matt and a storyline that is scant finds one leaving metropolis and heading for the hills."
3,Not that good,i bought this dvd a while ago and rewatched it last night for the first time after a while.....I just found the characters so two dimensional...the story wants to take of..but does not really sucseed...And the actors did not really delft very deep into their emotions... abit dissapointing...
4,"""Reading Photographs"" - book","I need this book for an upcoming photography class. Most places charge $10.00 or more for it. I found a great deal here for less than $2.00 before S&H. The book is used, but that's not a problem; it's in good condition as is."
2,looks good doesn't last long,"really liked the styling of this toaster and the reviews were good, but the reviews that were bad for this product are what I should have listened to. after only a few months the spring in the left side started getting weak and would not return the waffles all the way up. I then started using the right side and it has been better, but alas the spring in that side is weak as well. besides that the toasting quality is good but not returning the waffles back up thing is essential to my toasting of anything."
5,Top of the line toaster,"I have been very pleased to move up to this high-quality toaster. I replaced my old toaster after a kitchen remodeling, and the red color is just right. The design is attractive, it is made entirely of steel (not plastic) and it looks substantial. Overall, an asset to my decor and a fine toaster."
1,Waste of $,"This toaster is no longer functioning after owning it for just a year. The knobs to push the bread down no longer stay down. The first mechanism broke about two months ago, so I could at least toast two pieces at a time - now the second mechanism broke. This toaster has never toasted evenly. If I wanted all sides toasted, then I had to endure part of it being burnt. Very disappointing to waste so much money on an inferior product."
4,"Nice romp through the playground, but a bit repetitive....","Not gonna say much here, this game has been out for quite some time. There's enough content to keep you playing through to the end collecting all the monsters, but after that, it's really just a quick little time killer."
3,A Lot of Fun,"My two boys (six and four)love this game. The graphics are great, and it's a lot of fun to be able to switch monsters and cities. It can get a bit monotonous after a while, though, and I'm not sure that kids much older would be too enthralled with it, since you're basically just knocking down building after building, over and over, although you can also do some other things, like destroy tanks, eat people, and knock down helicopters and planes. A fun diversion, but sort of simplistic."
3,ho-hum game,"It's fun for a while, but then it just gets a little harder each level which isn't the problem. The problem is that it never seems new...it's sort of like Grand Theft Auto, how many times can you steal a car and run over people? So I played this game for a few days, destroyed a bunch of buildings, ate a bunch of people, then relegated it back to the shelf and went back to some of my other games. It probably wouldn't be bad for a kid, but I got bored with it pretty quickly. Thought I would be excited to play it like I was 20 years ago in the arcades."
2,Disappointing,THis book doesn't really offer information for doing a brunch. It has a limited amount of recipes. Some of them are as obvious as adding fruit and milk to store purchased granola. Or ones like adding icecream to coffee. There are much better breakfast books and brunch information than this book.
3,Missing the North section of town!!,"Overall, a good map - BUT, it's missing a lot of the North section of town. The Northernmost point on the map is exit #149 off of I-25 (E. Woodmen Rd). The entire Briargate area has been ommited. Disappointing for a 2005 edition map."
4,Good look at E-Type interior details.,"Another in the Original Cars Series by Philip Porter. Excellent color photography by Tim Andrew. All of the cars pictured are right hand drive. There are enough close-ups of details, especially interiors to make this car worth the price. Covers everything from the flat-floor S1's to the last black S3. Especially useful is the charts of all of the original factory interior - exterior color combinations. Lots of details on production changes. Well worth the price"
5,JAGUAR E TYPE,This is a must book for anyone desiring to purchase or restore a Jaguar E-Type. Many of the manufacturing nuances and much of the actual production numbers are in this book. Great pictures reveal the authenticity and serve as a great buying guide
1,Crap..,"Can't really say much else about this movie. I thought that the five star rating was too good to be true..well I was right. Dull, slow, and witless humor. I couldn't even make through the entire movie. Very misleading five star ratings and reviews. Wish I could get a refund.."
3,Good historical recording,"Michelangeli's performance on the Emperor Concerto is admirable and the Paris Symphony is sympathetic, but it should be pointed out this is a 1975 recording. The sound is reasonably clean but it is slightly noisy and there are several places in the recording where there is audible distortion perhaps due to microphone or tape overload. It also seems to be a live recording, given the coughs audible, and should have been labelled as such.The sound quality on the Haydn Concerto is several notches down from the Beethoven. It is a mono recording with little dynamic or frequency range. Recording technology was *much* better than this in 1967 so perhaps this was a radio or television broacast or backup tape, or the sound engineers were ungifted amateurs. It too is a live performance.The performances are good. The sound is not."
2,Actual product is black,"My husband builds houses and the tool rig in the image is the only one he's found to be comfortable wearing all day, but his is warn out. So, we ordered this item, and we received a similar tool rig in black. We live in Hawaii and black is just too hot for working in the sun all day."
5,"COMO TU, SOY UNA MADRE LLENA DE AMOR","pero hasta que leí este libro EXTRAORDINARIO, no me di cuenta de que ESTABA SOFOCANDO A NUESTRO HIJO CON MI AMOR EXCESIVO.No le permitía dar paso sin estar a su lado, ni ensayar o desplegar sus propias alas!Bendito libro que me hizo darme cuenta de que estaba convirtiendo a nuestro Dany en un pájaro sin alas, en un ser sin iniciativa propia !TE LO RECOMIENDO, AMIGA....YO NO ME DI CUENTA HASTA QUE MIU DANY TENÍA CUATRO AÑOS !"
1,not read yet,I can't write 20 words as I have not yet read the book. It is in my Kindle and will be read when I have finished Albright's Prague Winter
5,"An honest, yet stirring, historical novel","This book provides a window into the values and culture of British colonialists in India. The author exposes the arrogance, racism, and self-satisfaction of the British characters, but also their courage, determination, and inventiveness. This was a novel that I could barely put down, and the characters and ambiance of India lingered in my mind for days afterwards. The Siege of Krishnapur lives up to its lavish accolades, and I highly recommend it."
3,It's OK,"It's a fairly easy read about an interesting period in Indo-English history.It suffers from that arch tongue in cheek tone that is popular in English writers.A little goes a long way, it's like eating powdered sugar."
1,HO-HUM,"THIS IS A HEADLINE: THAT CARESl a waste of time; a MAJOR""who cares' novel....did not meet my expectations, and I am not a sharp critic, believe me."
3,Insightful!!,"This book was very slow giving the what happened with the siege and what after the siege and more than enough before to understand the why. It was educational from the standpoint of seeing how governments or organizations can go into other countries and think that by dismissing the if the native cultural works, immediately think that their way should be welcomed and make life better. It seems humans never learn from history but actually think they are doing it differently and better.Since time began we are still trying to have power and wealth and the cost of others!"
4,my review of the siege,"i was entertained by this book. i liked the depiction of the characters, descriptions of locations and activities and i could clearly imagine the sights, the colors and smells that were described. i can only read about a half hour a day but i was always eager to resume reading at my next opportunity. one thing i missed, however was we were never told what happened to the collector's daughters and wife. still a mysyery to me."
3,Interesting but plodding,"The historical information and detail was interesting, but I found myself putting this book down often. I would pick it up again, but it was not riveting. That said, if you enjoy a sardonic style, you will enjoy this. Some of the descriptions of the people and activities are very humorous. The author uses sarcasm to poke fun at the colonial British. The story is fiction based on a conglomeration of historical events. The actual siege described takes place in a fictional town. I think that I would have enjoyed it more if it had been based on a true event."
4,Fascinating Read,"It took patience for me to get past the beginning of the book knowing that the story and character development would likely follow. I'm so glad I didn't put the book down prematurely. It was a captivating look at some of the history of the British occupation of India. Not only was the story a very good one, it offered a lot of philosophical material upon which to ponder. It was difficult to imagine the difficulty and hardship suffered on both sides but I felt it was well balanced in its presentation. I would give it a 4.5 if I could, only because I found the beginning a bit difficult to digest."
4,vivid,"The only reason i don't give this book 5 stars is it got too wordy at the end. The characters feel real, the cultural situation is fascinating. This is a portrait of the British in India, rather than India itself, in that it is a story of colonial attitudes. Though it is 40 years old, the writing style, the point of view, all hold up. A worthwhile read."
5,"A Wonderful, engrosing, complex triamph!","Seige is a literary world, not only comprised of the time period in which it takes place, but also the lives of the rich, wonderfully developed caracters that inhabit it. It comments about the flaws of cultural eletism without unrelenting, ax weilding force (a constant temptation with a work like this, I would assume). Readers are as chalenched as the caracters to find truth and falsehood, right and wrong, hope and false hope in a world that has twisted uppon itself, suffocating their ideals. This free reing and trust given to the readers by Farrell is a testament to the skill in wich this novel was writen. When we explore the caracters, it is not as dispationate observers, we are drawn in to their moral and philosophical stuggles, we laugh and cry with them. This ranks among the best books I have ever read. However, as a warning, for someone unfirmiliar with the time period, the terminology could become somewhat daunting"
2,Lots of ups and downs,"While a great deal of the novel is well written and indeed stunning in its imagery and use of language, a great deal of it is not. There is much plodding, pedestrian verbiage larded heavily with cliches, and incidents that are wildly improbable to say the least. The author has added a great deal of detail to the battle scenes, but I found myself many times frowning too often at miracles that could simply not be performed by such a small, beleaguered garrison.It's one thing to research warfare and write a book containing battle scenes, quite another to experience war before picking up your pen."
3,Is this a Monty Python?,"I thought this would be a serious story. The title sure sounds like it.It was actually quite comical. Not ha, ha, ha. But amusing. Mixed with the pain and suffering, this story became a confusing mess. At times it dragged, and it may be too long. Overall, I enjoyed it.It is helpful to have read some of the numerous prize-winning books about India. This is one of the better ones. Does not rate a 4, but I'd give only a bit less."
3,Disappointing after reading all the reviews,"I got this book after reading the reviews here. Unfortunately I read it after reading ""Our Bones Are Scattered"", a history of the Cawnpore massacre. ""Our Bones..."" is a much more detailed and vivid description of the circumstances of the Mutiny. ""Seige of Krishnapur"" was O.K. but I would not really recommend it except to someone with a particular interest in the Indian experience. I would recommend ""Our Bones Are Scattered"""
2,More like a prelude,I read 38% into the book without getting to anything about the actual siege. The book should be rename to something like Prelude and Events leading up to the siege of...
2,I got half way through,I gave up at about half way through this book. I was unable to connect with or care about the characters in the story.
1,The siege of Krishnapur,Found the style of writing pedantic and long-winded. Didn't get past chapter 1. Maybe if I had persevered further would have found something.
2,Borring English history in India,"I like history and historical stories but this book is very borring in the long repeated details of the British Tea Company and how they, the British, settled India. This book has a lot of details of how arragonant the British were in the early colony settlement of India. However this attention to detail to me was very borring."
5,A tragic tale,"This is one of those books that you want to keep reading, although it's a tale of arrogance of the English in India and their ultimate downfall. Even more amazing is that it is based on real events."
2,The Ant No-No,"It was hard for my kids to learn how to do. When they learn how to play the game, it was not fun anymore."
2,I question the paper/ink format they used for printing this,"Yes, these are Paint-By-Numbers, Picross, Illustrated Logic, Nonogram, Griddler type puzzles. I love these types of puzzles- BUT the Sunday Telegraph series bothers me as the earlier volumes (1 and 2 I believe) contained errors within the puzzles. Also, these are printed on regular paperback novel-type paper, so you'll be scratching away holes through the pages if your pencil is too sharp... and erasing on this paper/ink combo leaves for a horrid mess!I bought all these (spent $10 each! to have them imported a few years back)before these picture puzzle books became more mainstream and easier to locate.I'd suggest avoiding these books if at all possible.BTW- Each puzzle contains a ""title"" which gives away what the puzzle will be once completed-I couldn't believe this :("
4,RECOMMENDED - a good guide for the intermediate practitioner,"This book is a translation of Fu's step-by-step description of the Yang style Tai Chi form as it was taught to him. Each technique is described in detail, along with illustrations and notes for the student. The ONLY problem I have with this book is that instead of presenting the material in a linear fashion as Fu's original, the reader is required to flip back and forth when referring to material already presented (so I docked one star for this cheapness/ laziness). There is also a brief overview of push hands, and what I believe to be a more faithful translation of the Tai Chi Classics - more closely capturing the poetic beauty of the original Chinese."
4,classic,"No book is a substitute for a good teacher, but if you are a serious student of taijiquan, you will benefit from this resource. The posture instructions and discussion of details are exemplary and the sort of thing that can help you refine your practice over time, even if you have been doing this for a while. highly recommended. Younger students can also benefit, if studied together with following your teacher's instruction."
4,Definitive Yang Cheng Fu form.,This book is really brilliant for those wishing to learn the 'Big' form. Descriptions and drawings are precise and helpful. Fu was a lineage holder and disciple in this style.
4,"Good fundamentals, Good Basic Form","This book provides a rather detailed look at an earlier Yang Long Form than is often taught today - some practice points during specific postures have been discarded in more modern forms in Yang Style, and it was good to review and decide for myself which points to include. The diagrams can be a bit confusing sometimes, and the movements are not as explicit as I would prefer - but in a way, that's a good thing - figure it out for yourself based upon the fundamental principles and decide what feels right to you.I would recommend any practitioner not to use this book alone to study Taijiquan, but it is a very helpful reference (I've studied Taijiquan for 5 years.)"
2,Why does everyone else give this book 5 stars??,"The bulk of this book is taken by yet another description of the form - and, in my personal opinion, form is something that can only be taught in person - thus the value is dubious.The section on ""push hands"" and da-lu is also very mechanical.And as far as the remaining ""non-pictorial"" part of the book, a much better - and more comprehensive - option would be ""Tai Chi Touchstones"" by D. Wile."
4,Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan,Very detailed descriptions of each posture in the traditional Yang Family T'ai-Chi Ch'uan. For the practioner who wants to get to the bottom of each posture in the form. The new translations of some of the T'ai-Chi Ch'uan Classics is very enlightening.
1,Stephen Levine has saved my psyche!!!!,"I have recently experienced a profound loss and I knew I had to go to Mr. Levine for some relief, some profound mercy. His voice is so soothing, but not so soothing as his philosophies and meditations. To me he is the best in this field, period and I have investigated widely in this area. You know and feel that he has been there, that he knows what he is talking about. He gives you the idea that getting through life's most severe traumas is not only doable, but very effective in making one grow as a person and soul."
3,Disappointed,"Although Levine has some insights, he's terribly repetitive and often simply varies a basic theme. The book did not offer me the solace I had intended receiving when I ordered it on someone's recommendation.What I really needed was a focussed discussion of pragmatic, not ethereal or philosophical, steps to reduce the grief from the loss of a dear one."
4,Wide-tastic,"A great add-on for the Xacti HD1, but two minor problems I've found so far. 1. I can't use a circular polarizing filter with the wide angle lens as it cuts off the corners of a picture and; 2. flash photography won't work as the pop-up flash becomes obscured by the barrel of the add-on lens."
2,Great for video but cannot be used for stills w/ flash,"If you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the Xacti HD1A, you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash. The adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos.It does work well for video. The Sanyo Xacti HD1A camera itself is a disappointment."
5,"The original tv series, and still the best!","This is a very charming start to the whole Thomas phenom. I love the old-school animation style with actual figures and NO computer assistance. Ringo Starr is great voicing for the programs. If the second season is like this, I would get that series too.Toddlers/preschoolers will want these dvds over and over and over again!"
5,DJ Mendez's Style Is Unbelieveable!!,"I love everything about the 2nd cd. Mixed by DJ Mendez. More Darker, More Technical, Crazier sounding Drum N Bass Tunes. It's amazing how far Drum N Bass has become over the years, and this CD just proves all of that. It has some of the sickest sounding beats that I have heard in a while. This CD has got some good style to it. I give it 5 starz. And it also comes with an extra CD for DJ's to mix with. And that's even got some Tight sounding tracks on it too!!"
5,Great Stroller for Great Price,"I am an avid runner (4 10k's/week) and I bought this stroller to keep at my Mom's place for when I visit. It is lighter than other ones I've tried, has GREAT storage, good looking, a very sturdy feel to it, yet is maneuverable. Also, the seatback reclines enough to where my son is comfortable napping. I am very happy with this purchase!!!"
4,good value and durable! Break is hard to setup!,"I purchased this stroller around $95 with free shipping. For that price, it is pretty good quality.I have 2 complains about this product1) This jogging stroller is kinda big to fit in Small SUV's trunk.2) Break is hard to set up. I spend couple hours setting up the break, but couldn't make it to work. So I took it to bike shop and they set it up nicely for $15.00"
3,small jogger,I bought this jogger after reading another review. upon receiving the jogger I found it was easy to assemble but the seat is very small. The tiers are also a pain to maintain air pressure but I use the jogger on city sidewalks.
5,Jogging stroller,"I was VERY pleased with the price, free shipping and prompt delivery. My son and his wife were thrilled to receive the stroller!"
1,jajaja Butterfly Europa???,"Buyer bought Butterfly Europa Net New... Seller sent Butterfly National League Used.... Item will return ASAP. TOTAL disaster how this can happens, we are professionals or not?"
3,Works,"This came on time and in one piece. I fit onto my Cavalier, but not quite like OEM. It doesn't fit as flush as the original on the outside edge. You really can't tell from a distance, so I'm not really worried about it. It is an aftermarket part for a discontinued model vehicle, so what're you gonna do, right?"
1,Chelynne,"I was extremely disappointed in this book and could hardly believe it was written by the same author as the Virgin River Series. It's a good thing I read that series first because if I had read Chelynne first, I would never have bought the Virgin River Series thinking they would have been as bad. I read for enjoyment and this is not a book that leaves the reader with a good feeling. I would certainly not classify this as a romance. There was nothing romantic about how the two main characters interacted."
2,Way to long for the storyline,"Once the story was set up, it seemed forever until the characters started to come together and understand each other. I love Robyn Carr's Virgin River series, but this was nothing like it. To much misunderstanding and downright hostility between the character at the beginng of the story to ever see a happy ending."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This is Robyn Carr's first historical fiction and it's absolutely riveting. I stayed up late reading about Chelynne and Chadwick and I just couldn't get enough. The setting of the court of Charles II also came to life, for all you history buffs out there. There's gossip, betrayal, looming war, scandals, affairs, everything you could want and more."
2,Damaged Goods,"The CD has one complete track that won't play. It makes terrible noises on track 7 of disk 1. It arrived in adequate packaging and reflects no indications of physical damage. It would appear that the disk was damaged during production or, at least, prior to packaging. If it was sold as a ""second,"" the item description should have so stated but it did not. I am very disappointed with this supplier."
3,The Collection ?,"Got my copy of this cd, yesterday! This 2cd set should of been onlyone because the first cd has a lot of there best old songs & the 2ndcd has about 3 that was known to be played on the radio but Ionly like 2 songs on the 2nd cd! Cd 1 is the best but not worthgetting! The Collection ? Not a good collection that was puttogether, (hee hee hee) next time I'll just get the Best Of orGreatest Hits & I'll make sure it's only one cd! Don't get me wrong,the Moody blue has a lot of good songs but the choice of what theycall, The Collection was not good & that was the 2nd cd! Too bad thesong, ""The Voice"" wasn't added to the 1st disc that is a really goodsong!"
5,Great insights and advice,"Great insights and advice on how to manage (even embrace) your shyness, leverage your strengths and promote your writing in a way that feels comfortable and right."
1,"Cheap, means cheap","I live in a building and I needed something to haul my groceries from my car to my apartment. It's only my boyfriend and I, so not a huge grocery bill each week. I went shopping ONCE, and one of the handles broke. You can fit the equivalent of one and half paper back, that's it. Forget sodas, water, etc... maybe to buy butter, and 12 eggs..."
1,Poor Quality; Waste of my time,"Thank goodness I was refunded the full amount for this. On the second use, the wheel support broke, causing the wheel to collapse. I ended up having to carry the whole thing with my groceries inside. Even before that happened, it was not easy to maneuver."
3,adequate,I have seen others use this type of bag; my concern will be the wear on the wheels over concrete in Arizona summers. Might be meltdown; one can't expect champagne results on a soda=priced item.
4,folding shopping bag,"This is the second of this product we have. We keep one in each vehicle to use when shopping, and they come in very handy, especially due to the folding wheels."
3,Wrong Item Received,This Item was provided by American Drug Supply Store and was not the item I had ordered. Their return process worked reasonably well and after I returned the item to them I received the correct one within several days. Their return policy includes them paying for shipping both ways as long as it wasn't the fault of the purchaser. I'm still waiting for the credit for the return shipping.
1,Horrible and Worthless Junk,"Don't buy these generic and uncompatible graphics. Because most of the images are Windows Metafiles, they are incompatible with a lot of design software. I was never actually able to encompass any of the art into my websites for this reasons. Also, most of the clipart was pure junk. Then when I tried to uninstall the software, I couldn't. Don't pay $.01 for ClickArt."
5,Awesome cook book!,I will never be without this book. I love mexican food and found this book easy to follow. I wish more books were like this one!
5,Lots of awesome recipes!,Lots of awesome recipes! So many variations! I gave the book to my roommate as a gift and she absolutely loved it. It gave her so many ideas that she didn't think about. She says she can't wait to try out the recipes at her resturant!
2,More American than Mexican,"Not much different in this collection of recipes from our major American cookbooks. It seems very much like American recipes labelled as Mexican ones.This cookbooks does not do a satisfactory job in the description and use of traditional Mexican flavors, chiles, chocolate, cinnamon, or of traditional native foods, such as avocadoes, pumpkins, turkeys, tropical fruits."
2,"No cumin, please!!!","It's a very common misconception that cumin is a spice used a lot in Mexican food. That is not the case; only in certain recipes cumin is used, and they are a minority. Probably Americans have confused the spices from Mexican and Asian cooking. Practically every recipe in this book asks for cumin. I'm shocked."
3,Great recipes / Bad Spanish,"I have just received 1,000 Mexican Recipes in the mail. I am very excited to try out several of the recipes. But I am reading the Spanish translations as I leaf through the book and I am disappointed. There are so many errors in the Spanish.I am a Spanish teacher. Why could not Marge and Bill Poore have hired me or someone else who knows good Spanish to edit these titles? It's not a job they can do on their own, no matter how many trips they make to their friends' houses in Mexico. They know nothing about where to put an accent, noun/adjective agreement, or prepositions. There are even spelling mistakes. This is very annoying. I want to cook with this book--not feel like I have to grade it."
4,Among the Barons,Among the Barons is a book about a shadow child named Luke. He's a third child and the goverment doesn't allow them because of a food shortage so he was asigned to another family whose second son had died on a ski chase. Luke's now going to Hendrix Boarding School for Boys to hide his identity when his fake brother shows up with a wierd body guard. Lukes life may be in danger. To find out what happens read Among the Barons.
4,Among the Barons,"Among the Barons didn't disappoint me. It was one of the best in the Shadow Children series. It was so much more suspenseful and especially the ending was gripping. There was more danger and action. I didn't like Smits though, he was too whiny. The barons make me angry because people are starving and they just throw their extra food away! Most of the book was really good though! I really liked it and I plan to read the other books in the series."
1,Not Availible in the USA,"I am complaining due to the fact that I own the 1st 3 books in the series. I love the series so far. Today however, I went to purchase Among the BArons kindle edition and I learned that this bookis not availible in the USA. I think that it is extrememly unsatistfying to have all the books availible for the kindle except the middle book of the series. I am not a happy customer!"
3,great book but...,its too expensive th book is short and you ca get for acheaper price in paper back but its still a great book
3,Neccessary for series but like a 3 hr movie!,"""L"" is surrounded by many characters, and this book is admittedly most worthy of a film in the following of books such as Harry Potter's series. ""Barons"" had interesting dialouge, but it tends to drag on. Tends to have stereotypes about social classes, particularly the rich aka barons. However, this book isn't as great as the other books in the Shadow series. Hint: Buy the cheapest one you can find online."
3,Among the barons review,"da book is good,great,excellent,superexecellent,marvellous,suspenseful,super,terrific. Capital choice if u like the seriz.u need reed this book 2 get the flow of the seriz. gives foreshadowing for what is about to come in ""among the brave""the next book in line. very suspenseful, hooked me so fast and so long, i didn't put it down till i finished. after reading thisbook go straight into ""among the brave"" so da adventurous story can go on. don ask questions, just get it and reed it.(unless ur those type of people who think adventures and action is superfluous) or u just don like those kinda novels ...u wunt wanna reed this book cuz its all adventure and action.PS: hope u dun mind the cr4p speelingvict0r1ous"
4,An Awesome Book,Luke was in hiding since he could remember till he met a girl. He went to a secret school he has a new brother and a rich family. It's about the best book I've read compared to her other works. I love this book and it would get into one of the best books in my opinion.If you like mystery sad stories you should read this book called Among the barons by Margaret Peterson Haddix.(...)
5,YOU GO HADDIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Wow words cannot even describe how great and captivating this book is. It keeps you guessing the whole way through. A good book should be a thrill ride and this was!!!!! I mean hey wat r u doing still at your desk reading this get out and Buy It NOW!!!!!!
4,John's Review,"Luke is an ordinary child, but for one reason, he is a third child, and when America's food supply falls to really low the president outlawed any family to have more than two children. Then an opportunity of a life time occurred. what any third child's dreams of, a fake i.d of a kid he has never met that passed away. In the previous book of this amazing series, Among the Hidden Luke finds a third child living in a government official's house, Mr. Talbot helps Luke get his id.You don't have to read the first book because alone it stands outbut is recommended to be read in a series because of the great detail given you will be of the edge of your seat wanting more. Among The Barons is a science fiction book. I recommended this book to any one in the age group from young people of 9 and teenagers of 90. If I could rate it, id say its not perfect because it could use a little more detail but otherwise the description is finely used.-John Lester"
1,I had the misfortune of listening to this,"All I can say about this band is that it's terrible. Whiny girl vocals, singing badly about something or the other. Terrible music. TERRIBLE."
2,No observed effect,"As a result of an opereation I had in my early 20s, I've had digestive problems for over 30 years. I was hoping that this product would improve my digestion, but alas it did not. I used all 30 tablets, but was unable to detect any effect of any kind. I would have given it only one star, but since it didn't hurt me, I decided to give it two."
2,Works differently on everyone,"After using this product for five days I ended up with diarrhea. I continued the product the next two weeks and found it made me very constipated.I'm glad this product helps alot of people, unfortunately for me it wasn't a positive experience."
4,It really works,"Sustenex is the latest in several probiotics I've tried over the years...but it's the first that seems to really work. The ""You"" docs recommended this so I decided to give it a try for my irratible bowel syndrome....things are moving along well....which is unusual for me. I am very glad to have come across this productVJS RN"
4,"Works well, but no difference from lower-priced brands","I've tried a variety of probiotics and am 100% sold on the benefits - much better digestive order and regularity. I've been using mostly generic brands, but thought I'd try this one to see if there is any difference.On the plus side, the Sustenex works very well, and you only need to take one capsule per day (although the cap size is somewhat large). But, I've not noticed any difference from the generic brands that cost far less per dose, even though with some of them you have to take two caps instead of just one.If you're on the fence regarding probiotics it's not hype - it really does work, and makes a big difference in digestive health and well-being, especially if you suffer from IBS, irregularity or bloating. Start taking them - you won't be sorry. This is an excellent product but you can get the same benefits with the generics you can get in discount stores or warehouse clubs."
5,Good stuff,Probiotics are a life saver for those of us with IBS. I think one pill a week is enough though I don't need to reestablish the little bug colony more than that. I love this product.
5,It works!,Just one a day makes me feel so much better. And they are easy to swallow along with my other vitamins.
1,Not for everyone,"I am a seventy eight year old white female, and consider myself to be in good health. I do have to watch my BP but can control it with my diet. My daughter heard about this wonderful probiotic medicine at work and thought it was just what she and ""ole Mom"" needed to try. She immediately purchased a box for herself and one for ""ole Mom"". She is very happy with the product. My reaction was different. Daughter says give it a few days and it will ""kick in"". And it did; from the top of my head down thru chest, stomach, and on south. My walking machine was history for several weeks.I only took the ""product"" for a short time but recovery time is taking awhile."
1,This product should be banned from the market,"This product should be banned from the market. I took this product for the first time and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. My blood pressure went sky high, I was dizzy, a bad headache came on and I had to vomit. I now have to write to the company and try to get my money back somehow."
3,I guess it's good,I bought this product after I saw an ad on TV saying that it will help with digestion by adding additional bacteria in the intestines. The ad claimed that this product is 10 times better than yogurt. I have used this product for almost 2 months now and I can say I don't have any negative thing to say about it. I can also say I didn't notice much of a difference in my digestion. I still feel acidity and heartburn in the back of my throat after meals sometimes. I thought that product will help me overcome this problem. I decided to stop ordering after the 2nd month of use.. I can not recommend this product but maybe that's just me. You can try it for yourself and see.
5,The Best,This stuff is fantastic. Much better than Align based on effectiveness and price. Sustenex is 1/3 the price of Align.Great stuff. Try it out. Keeps my digestive system humming right along.
2,No difference... yogurt or nothing at all,"I've eaten yogurt and cottage cheese made with probiotics, so when Amazon Vine offered a sample to try -- I signed up. I was interested in seeing how the pill would work in comparison since it means no extra calories when you're not in the mood for yogurt or cottage cheese (some of the probiotic yogurt products taste terrible, but Dannon Activia vanilla is tasty).Sadly, I didn't experience anything different. Based on research, it sounds like probiotics are hit or miss. They work great for some and don't for others.For those who do benefit from probiotics -- the pill form has an advantage over yogurt in that it has more probiotics (how much should we even have?), does not require refrigeration, 0 calories, and cheaper. Amazon sells a 30 day supply for $14.99. Comparable pricing for yogurt depends on your geographical location and store. It's about $3.85 for four days' worth of yogurt. The pills are easily cheaper."
5,A great idea.,"One thing I really like about this product is the effort they've made to help the beneficial bacteria survive your stomach acids to help deliver it live to your intestines where it can do some good. The bacteria are protected by multiple layers of natural organic material that protects the bacteria as they travel through the stomach.Having enough beneficial bacteria in your colon is very good for your health and strengthens the ability of your immune system to fight off infections. Especially if you've recently had to take antibiotics, this is a fast way to recover the colonic flora you need for good health.Sustenex delivers 2 billion bacteria to your colon per capsule!It will help, of course, if you also eat enough fiber, because that's what these bacteria feed on. If you get the bacteria to your intestine and don't give them what they need to survive, it won't do you much good. But combined with fiber, this is a powerful but simple way to boost your health."
3,Didn't Notice Any Difference,"Being lactose intolerant and having several other foods that cause me digestion problems, I thought that this would be a great thing to have since I can't eat yogurt. So I took one pill each morning with my other vitamins hoping that it would reduce my sensitivity to certain foods and make me feel better. However after nearly using the entire box I am still not really seeing anything measurable out of it. I guess I am not any worse off than when I started and there are other health benefits associated with probiotics so it was not a worthless endeavor. But as far as fixing my digestion issues I have to say either it just isn't working or maybe I need to be on it longer than a month to see results."
1,BAD,I switched to this product since it was 1/2 the price of Align. Big mistake! Didn't work and made problems worse. I'm back on Align and bloating is gone again. Align is the only pro-biotic that has worked for me and I have tried 10+ brands over 10 years.
5,Sustenex is the best one I have tried so far.,I have tried 30 days of Sustenex and am pleased. It was recommended to me by a friend who suffers colon problems and Sustenex has really helped her and keeps everything under control.
5,Very Good Probiotic,"I was diagnose with IBS. This is best,it does not upset the stomach. I have taken it on an empty and full stomach. I have taken it with water,juice,and soy milk. The first day I was relived of gas,bloating,and nausea. And best of all I was able to go the bathroom for a BM. I love Sustenex Probiotic's.And I love and thank you Amazon for having this at a very very reasonable price. ALWAYS GRATEFUL,IOLA"
1,Didn't Do a Thing For Me,"Took these for a month, no effect whatsoever.Only thing that works for me is Miralax, app. three times a week. Check wih your doctor, but my gastro-enterologist says it's safe. ""Liquid fiber"" he calls it."
4,works,This a good product. It helps with intestinal dysbiosis. I needed to take 4 tablets twice daily to take effect initially. I had tried many other probiotics including Dr. Ohirra's 12 which i needed to take 20 pills a day for similar effect. The acid resistant shell really helps. It gave me a lot of bad gas at first which my wife didn't appreciate. The makers of the product say that means the probiotic is colonizing and kicking out the bad guys. Have a good day I rate this four stars because i have to take a lot of it.I wish they would make capsules a lot strongeer with at least 10 billion units
3,Not sure what to say...,"I decided to give this product a try because I have a host of digestive problems and get sick all of the time and probiotics are supposed to be very beneficial. I tried it out for a couple of a weeks, and I did not feel like there was a significant change in my digestive track.This product claims that by helping your digestive track, it will give your immune system a boost (this is a true), but while taking it I got the sickest I had been in the last year. No that this means the product doesn't work, I just didn't feel any major difference when I was taking it, or that helped my digestive track.I am not saying this is a bad product, but it probably will not help you very much if you have moderate to severe digestive problems."
5,Saved my stomach,"Throughout my pregnancy, I had monster heartburn and nausea. In fact, for the last 15 years I've had stomach problems. Probiotics keep me out of the doctor's office and off the prescriptions. When I couldn't take much while I was pregnant, I was very glad to put these on subscription."
4,Sustenex,"This works great for people with problem tummies, and has the added bonus of helping to keep you healthy! I haven't gotten a serious cold or flu since I started taking it!Much cheaper at Amazon then in the store!"
4,Mistake,"The title:Beethoven: Symphony no 9 / Furtwangler, Stockholm PO Composer: Beethoven Conductor: Wilhelm Furtwangler Ensemble: Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra Music & Arts - #4002 / November 16, 1999 Audio CD / AAD / Number of Discs: 1 ASIN: B00002062KHas nothing to do with the content info:1.

Romances (3) for Piano, Opus 28: no 2 in F sharp major Composed by Robert Schumann with Percy Aldridge Grainger5. Symphonic Etudes for Piano, Opus 13Composed by Robert Schumann with Percy Aldridge Grainger"
2,Watch Out!,"This seems like a very nice performance of the 9th, but watch out! This was recorded in 1943, and mastered from lacquer disks. There's a lot of hissing, popping, etc., and it generally sounds like it's playing on your great-grandmother's Victrola."
2,Beethoven: Symphony #9/Furtwangler,"You just can't beat Ludwig Van's Number 9. This classic is even rendered on CD with all the hissing and popping sounds from the original record it was recorded off of last century. In fact, it was so poorly recorded, I thought it was a fake."
4,Watch it for the music,"The acting and plot are minimal here. If you watch just sit back and listen to the ""Killer Diller Blues Band."" The music is excellent thanks to a contribution from Keb Mo. It's mostly blues-rock with a few hymns thrown in just to keep up the church band part of the plot going."
5,It Was,"A movie about youth, friendship and loyalty with an amazing soundtrack and missing graphic sex scenes and violence, those don't come along very often and when you discover one buy it and treasure it. I stumbled onto this movie as an instant watch through Netflix, so why not, what did I have to lose. I lost nothing and gained hope, joy and insight. The next day I ordered the movie and have rewatched it several times. Never a fan, I have a new appreciation for the Blues. The music alone is worth watching this movie. Set in my home state of Missouri with few well known actors, the setting is authentic and the premise that talent can be found in the most unlikely places is plausable. The family dynamics, well-meaning social programs set in a small college town and unlikely friendships resulted in a film that is hopeful and heartwarming. Killer Diller is a Killer Diller movie."
1,Not what I expected,None of these turned out well - problems with all yeast packets. The bread never rose properly -whether done in the breadmaker or baked. The bread was heavy and hardened very quickly. Definitely not what I expected.
2,Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Cinnamon Bun Mix,"Hard to work with, but no less than what I expected from what I had heard. I'd like to be able to make sticky buns with it, so I am going to be experimenting to be able to give my Celiac daughter a chance to have some of the goodies we are used to enjoying during the holidays."
4,Add 1 bannana for 300% improvement,"The secret to this product is to add one beaten over-ripe bannana.It will then be BREAD rather than BRICK.This may work a bit better when baking in the oven so you can monitor rise-time, but it also improves the product 300% when using a Zoj* bread machine."
1,Broke my 3 year old's heart,"We have been gluten free for a while now and my 3 year was really missing bread. I didn't expect it to taste like regular bread, but didn't expect it to taste so horrible either. I made it in my bread maker and followed the directions exactly. It was very dense and tasted like potato and blackstrap molasses. When I gave it to my 3 year old he took one bite and started crying. I even had his piece slathered with butter and sprinkled sugar over it. Will not buy again."
3,Not as good as the Whole Grain,"I am a Huge fan of Bob's Red Mill bread mixes. I make 2 loaves a week. Have for over 6 years now!! I tried the Cinnamon Raisin Bread Mix and find it is much harder than the other mixes. The cinnamon is a bit overdone for my taste. I do not like to find fault with Bob's Red Mill as they always have excellent products. I take the Whole Grain Gluten-Free mix and add raisins and cinnamon to that and it is a much lighter bread. I love what they are doing, providing us with organic food that is made with integrity. I am not being critical of their efforts but I do prefer the other bread mixes."
3,"great bread substitute, but little flavor","Have tried other BRM products and LOVE them (cookie mix, pizza dough) but this was practically tasteless! The bread was easy to make and had GREAT texture, so I'll invest another $5 and try to add some flavor (I see that others recommend a ripe banana) such as molasses, honey and/or vanilla and hope for something yummy as well as nicely textured."
3,New to gluten free,"I am new to a gluten free diet and as another reviewer stated missed my occasional piece of toast in the morning. I purchased the Bob's Red Mill Cinnamon Raisin Bread mix with high hopes due to the reviews as well as the reputation of the company. I used my bread maker as directed and while it was baking it filled my home with a cinnamon smell that had my hopes up. It came out looking good, browned well and looked like an ordinary small loaf of bread. I sliced it when warm and it tasted a little flat with those bites without raisins. While it was definitely better than the rice bread that I bought from the freezer section of my grocer, it still leaves something to be desired. I tried it again a few days later after toasting it and again it has a slight aftertaste that I just do not find appealing.I will keep trying and may try to add a bit more spice the next time."
1,NO AC ADAPTER!!?,"After spending 200 on a port replicator and finding out that I need to buy another ac adapter, I am very upset! It uses the notebooks adapter. Stupid design and stupid of Sony not to include another adapter."
1,Pure Garbage,"Cartridge didn't fit my MP390, even though it plainly advertises for this printer on Amazon. Ink leaked everywhere.You get what you pay for. In my case, I paid to get royally f(ked"
3,cannon compatible ink cartridges,I was satisfied with the order with one exception.One of the cartridges had exploded in the sealed shipping container and the ink is all out of the cartridge.
4,Great Stuff for the great review,You will definetly like this one. Price is great and I believe you are getting 5 cart for the price of one original Canon cart. Especially great for school work!!
4,Great But Flawed,"I loved this book, the author was really insightful with the episodes he chose to review, the non-episode articles are also intelligantly written, often humerous and enjoyable. Where I think the book fails is that it doesn't cover the whole of seaon 8/9, only selected episodes, the episode in which Mulder appears. This is because the book has a shipper heart through and through and is intent on covering the Mulder and Scully relationship. Fair enough but I would have loved to see what the author thought of more non-shipper episodes. It isn't very comprehensive in that regard but still a good read."
2,Why the need for graphic sex?,"The First Amendment allows freedom of the press, which I am totally in favor of. However, [I was unprepared for ]the ...graphic depiction of sexual encounters in the first part of the book.Perhaps the author felt that readers would be bored by the tale, so he decided to interject numerous sex scenes into the book. For me, it ruined the tale.This is definitely not a book which should be on the shelves of any school system."
1,Yucky Orange Goop,I second the first reviewer! The exact same thing happened to me! Yucky orange goop all over my cookie dough!
1,Non-stick Nightmare,"My spouse purchased this item when we lost our wood pin during a move. I went to use this and my first reaction was Non-stick? was there ever a problem with real pins sticking? I looked for the name and it was not present which made me think someone didn't want their name on this product and here's why, not only is it the sticky-est rolling pin I've ever used, it is so light you have to press hard to get anything rolled out well. I also just experienced the water filling problem reported by other reviewers. I drained it well and we'll see what happens. I would not recommend this product."
4,Brave and fearless she is!,"Ramona thinks she's brave and fearless but she truly is deep inside. If Ramona was ever a real person, which she is to me, I'd probably love to be her friend. She is so interesting, it's hilarious. Like the word ""guts"". I'll always seem to think of her now."
4,a spunky gal,"Ramona's life is not picture perfect. Six is a difficult age, as I can definitely attest. Ramona has to deal with a teacher who doesn't understand, a classmate who baits her into getting into trouble, a best friend who is far too literal for her wild imagination, AND a big black gorilla. This book is painful in places, which makes it less easy to read than some of the others. But, it's wonderful anyway!"
5,Ramona the Brave (Avon Camelot Books),The yellowing pages tell the age of a book that is otherwise in top condition - no tears or writing. I am pleased with the purchase and timely delivery.
5,"Ramona Is Sweet And Believable, With Plenty Of Funny Moments","Ramona is a truly realistic character that is brought to life by the believable writing of Beverly Cleary.Still trying to grow up as she proceeds into grade one, Ramona can't help but continue to fall into trouble.One entertaining, true-to-life moment after another... Reading about Ramona's antics is very enjoyable.From being embarassed by her older sister, to being embarrassed by her friend Howie in front of her class, to dealing with Copycat Susan and her copied owl, and many, many more funny and frusturating things... You'll have fun reading this book. And you can't say that for a lot of books.Told in a way that you can really understand this first grader, Ramona The Brave will remind you of when you were a child. And what it felt like.Readers will pity Ramona when she's upset, they'll understand what she does and why. They'll feel her anger, and her happiness.Definetly a great book, and definetly worthy of 5 or more stars!Enjoy!"
4,Ramona the Brave,"My book is about a girl named Ramona Quimby.She is always trying to be so brave and doesn't she that she still just a little girl.Her sister Beezus,tries to keep her from acting evil.But one time she takes it to far.Read the book and see if the ending is her still being brave or getting talked down!!!!!!!"
2,TERRIBLE,THAT was the worst book by this author II have seen so many better someone should start on it cause it's nasty
5,love love love,i love this book i think it is super funny!guts ! ramona and bezous hilarious laughable mom and dad weird but most of ll i ghink it aas FUNNY
5,Tri-Sub Enclosure,"This enclosure (matched with a 300M Rockford Fosgate amp, 300RMS, 600 Peak) puts out massive bass, it fills the car with enormus solid bass, you'll feel it throughout your body. It fits perfectly in an Xterra and still leaves you with lots of room for whatever...I highly recommend the T410X3 for anyone who wants to feel every bass note!!!"
4,Make a hell of an Action Movie?,"""God is a Bullet"" would make a hell of an Action Movie. How about Josh Brolin as the lead. I couldn't help but think of ""No Country For Old Men"" as I read this. It was a quick read and kept me interested in the characters and their fates. Nothing exceptional about the writing but written as though the author knew of what he spoke. Men and women of good and evil in a southwestern landscape, you could feel and taste, are the keys to this novel. However the lines between right and wrong have never been grayer. Easy to pull against a Manson-like character such as Cyrus but he is not the only evil in this book. Greed, self interest, and a lack of morals abound in the main players. God would need a bandolier of bullets in this setting."
5,Glens Pages,"Nice! About time a book lived up to its hype, rough and at the same time made me shudder at what some of the folks in the story where going through. After reading the likes of Charles Grant and Richard Laymon to Andrew Vachss looks like there is also another name of add to a writer who does not pull any punches and yet comes away writing with also a new fresh stile all his own. To sum up this first book in one word: WHOOOOAAAAAAAAA!"
5,Top-drawer Thriller,"Enigmatic pseudonymous author. So far I cannot abide one other thing he's written. However, this book is the bomb. I forgive him everything else for having come up with this one. Yes, a dark story. But the villain, Cyrus! Worth taking the ride for him alone."
3,I've dwelled on this review...,"I've dwelled on this review and am still a bit lost as to my ""feelings"" about this novel. It is a first novel the author should be proud of but I sense that his best is yet to come.Stylishly written, at times over the top, an interesting bunch of characters; yet the end result left me unsatisfied. However I dont know what it is that I feel it needs, I just know it needs something..."
