3,An Insightful Book,This was book that did a good job of outlineing some very common preceptions of God. The author also does a good job of outlineing arguments for the Christologocial view. It is light reading and not deeply theological. The underlying message is find out who God is not who we want him to be.
4,Great Collection - but .....,"Where's Boom? Luckily they've excluded Taylor's 1989 remake of Sweet Bird of Youth, yet her absence in this over-the-top high 60s camp melodrama (or comedy, depending on your mood) is sorely missed. Please, please, please give us what we all secretly want (and some of us, openly need)."
1,Uplifting and interesting!,"This should show 5 stars.This book educates about some faithful people who are often overlooked because they are mentioned only briefly, or as side characters to bigger stories.Good read as well."
3,Eliptical Cross Trainer with Computer,"Very hard for me! I am old lady...I thought it would ""glide"" likecross-country skiing. Instead it is like bicycle riding standingup! One minute is all I can do."
1,Terrible Eliptical Machine,"I wish I could rate this a 0. It is a terrible eliptical machine - you definitely get what you pay for!!!I purchased the ""2 in 1 Elliptical Cross Trainer"" on 03/05/10 and received my purchase on 03/11/10 via UPS.My husband put the elliptical machine together (with all the tools provided). I was so excited to use this machine. My first work out on this machine was for approximately 10 minutes. The 2nd time I went to use the elliptical (the very next day), I heard an awful grinding noise and looked down to find the right side plastic cracked. As a consumer, I was left feeling very disappointed in the craftsmanship of this product.I contacted the vendor - Golf Outlets USA - and the only good thing I can say is about the customer service I received, NOT THE PRODUCT ITSELF. I received my full money back by 03/18/10.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
2,Confidence Elliptical,"Problems putting together - left arm/pedal bar did not fit properly. I had to tinker to get it together. Immediately started squeaking. I had to tighten the bolts on the left arm after only 1-2 minutes of use - every 1-2 minutes. (Otherwise, not only would there been loud screeching - the bottom of the arm would come apart.) Returning item. Completely dissatisfied with the item but still appreciate Amazon's service. UPS is picking it up today."
2,Was good...until it broke in less then a month,"This eliptical was good for the money, until it broke less then a month later! The foot rest completely fell off while my bf was on it...three times!, the bottom of the plastic cracked so that it makes and awful noise as you try to pedal it. The wires in the monitor snapped so that doesn't work now either, and it makes a grinding noise from who knows what. I mean how junky...we both weigh less then 200 lbs! We are in our 20's and its not like we have kids or pets running around knocking into it. At least they gave me a full refund..."
4,Assembled it myself...,At first assembling it was hard but i managed to get it together. I really like this elliptical trainer. It gives me a great workout. Ill be sure to update....
3,As everyone says......,"This item is as most others have said. It is easy to assemble, and it has a feeling of going downhill. It is an uncomfortable feeling, and I have yet to try and prop the item up with anything in an effort to fix it and make it more comfortable.If you are looking for an enexpensive unit this would probably be the one for you. If this is something you know you are going to use very often I would suggest getting one that cost a little more money and that doesnt have any downhill complaints."
3,Missing parts,Product received in a timely fashion however some parts (3 bolts) were missing. I had to go to a hardware store to pick up 3 bolts which didn't match colorwise. I believe another purchaser reported the same.
4,Great for the price,"I bought it reluctantly because it was only $89.00 then I got $10 off so 79, but paid 44 shippping, total was 124.00. We put it together in about a half an hour. At first it felt like I was leaning forward too much on the down stroke so we put a 30 inch two by four under the front part of the frame. Cheap fix, excellent motion, I love it. Computer actually works the way I would have designed it myself. Glad I bought it, encourage anyone not wanting to spend a fortune on one to get this one."
3,"Not bad for $99, but not worth more either","I just got the machine last week, it is easy to set up, and it feels sturdy enough when using it, although even at 5'9"", my knees almost hit the handles.The problem I have with it, is that the back end is way too high, so you're always sliding downwards into the foot rests until your toes get crammed and you have to wiggle back. I think this is due to the frame being a stationary bike, thats been slighty tweeked to be an elliptical."
3,BETTER THAN EXPECTED....,"i was skeptical when i purchased this, because it is just a picture, and you dont know the quality. some other reviews left me uncertain, but i bought it because it was reasonably priced. not too high, but not too cheap to where i thought it might be junk.i've used it for about a month now, almost every day. i love it. i did attach a 2x4 under the front, so im not leaning forward. i have it in my basement, so the squeeking (occasional) does not affect the rest of the house. i dont know how well the calorie counter or distance works, but it does keep time, which is a nice feature.i'd recommend it to anyone starting to get back in shape that doesnt have time to start a gym routine just yet. the way my schedule is now, i cant routinely go to a gym (no 24 hour gyms around here) but i can head down to my basement for an hour each day.i'd recommend it!"
1,Do NOT Buy This Item!!!,"Less than two months after I assembled this piece of equipment, it collapsed while I was using it. One of the metal joints that was welded at the factory cracked and the unit collapsed. I realize this was a very low-cost unit, but this is not acceptable.I could not under any circumstances recommend this piece of equipment to anyone."
4,good buy,"this elliptical is easy to assemble, easy to use, quiet while using, and a good workout. It is a good investment for your health and takes up little room."
1,Broke after two days!!!,Confidence Fitness Elliptical Cross Trainer broke after two days of light use. Build quality is terrible and customer service is even worse. Stay away from this item!!! Would give it Zero Stars!!!...but the lowest you can put is one star.
1,I Should Have Listened...,"In all my purchases (trust me, a lot!) with Amazon, I've never had a problem with an item before. I figured with so many reviews, a 3 star wasn't bad knowing how negative people can be over little things. Well, I should have listened.The product got to me on time and in great shape. It was more solid looking than I had expected. It was a little confusing to set up, but once I sat down and looked at the directions, it was pretty intuitive.However, during the first use, both pedals snapped off due to the extremely cheap plastic used. In addition, the bike was very wobbly. I returned it (which also went very well, thank you) and found a better elliptical at a garage sale for half the price."
2,Not worth it,You get what you pay for. I should have returned this product but didnt feel like taking the hour it would take to take it a part to ship it back. The design is alright but none of the bolts stay tight. The handle bars for your arms do not stay tight and you must stop in the middle of a work out to tighten them back before they fall off. One of the bolts for the foot pedal was threaded backwards and had to be turned in the opposite direction of normal. Also both bolts to the foot pedals are very cheap and do not tighten. The foot pedals become very shaky as the bolts loosen as you work out. Twice the bolt came completly out and the pedal fell to the floor. After the second time this happened and a large resulting bruise on my calf I stopped using this product.
3,"OK for the money, but has problems","I wasn't expecting an extremely well-built machine, but whenever I work out, the bolts on the side come loose, and I have to stop about every 7 minutes to tighten them up."
1,Expensive Coat Rack,"This machine is a complete piece of junk. Essentially it's the wheel for an exercise bike with some upright handles attached. On that note, it would be a terrible exercise bike as well. This is not a good elliptical. The fly wheel is very light so there is no stability to the machine. I tried what another user did and put a 2x4 under the front of the machine but that didn't help. I sanded a rut in the 2x4 for the front bar to sit inside but that didn't help, either. This machine now stands in my guest room collecting dust and holding coats from time to time. It was a waste of money.I purchased this machine a year ago and have used it no more than 30 times. The last time I used it, it wobbled around so much that I could only work out for 9 minutes. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
4,Eliptical,"I've got to tell you. I bought one of those elliptical trainer things. It's unbelievable. My back hurts, my arms hurt, I'm sweating, out of breath and totally exhausted. But I got that sucker put together. So far so good."
1,Terrible,Awful....the item came with damaged parts. Cracked Pedal and missing washer.I sent e-mail for replacement. But nobody got back to me. Now I am using this unsafe machine and the pedal bolt keep falling off due to missing washer!!!!
1,Great Deal. Great Shipping,I was skeptical of the quality and build of this item when I ordered. But it really is a great value if you are not wanting to spend $400+ on an elliptical. Shipped quickly and easy to put together.
1,dissappointed,"I received this elliptical and was so excitd to get it only to find out I had to put it together, It was missing a couple of washers and the instructions were not very easy to read..plus alot more information than needed very confusing. Have no idea why i thought it would get here in one piece. Fedex did a good job of beating up the box and probably broke it because when I used it it automatically started clacking.....sent it back without a problem they refunded me ...my boyfreind got one too same problem it was beaten up and broken as well and returned ..maybe should try differnt method of shipping or stronger packing. all and all I really like the size but I bought a used one ..bigger than needed but not broken and i didnt have to put it together"
1,worst,see i bought tis machine in november i used it only for a month after tat i went to india and came back now the leg pad is broken because tey have fixed it in tip .. so it came out now we r searcing for washers to fix it but we r nt getting it .. waste of money...if somebody can r if te company can please send me a pad again
1,Horrible,This product was used every other day and it is now broken. It is so loud and the pedals rub on the plastic. I have tired to fix it and it still does not work right. It is very cheaply made.
1,Huge Piece if Junk!!,This elliptical is the biggest piece of junk. The elliptical was practically thrown in the box on top of the styrofoam!! The legs were all scratched up. The center piece of plastic was scratched and has a hole in it. One foot pedal broke while putting it together and the other broke under my feet while I was trying it out. I hadn't been on it two minutes!! There were pieces missing here and there. And the ride is horribly unsmooth. I wasn't expecting a super fancy piece of equipment for the price and a few things wrong I could have dealt with but I have not one good thing to say about this elliptical!! Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks!!!!
2,A bit flimsy,"While it is a great bargain, there is continued upkeep required. The wheel/covers on the ends of the front of the elliptical keep coming off while working out. It's not broken, but its distracting."
1,Don't believe good reviews - this is awful,"Bought this thinking the poor reviews were not completely honest since there were good reviews as well. This was not too difficult to assemble, however, the screws for the right hand support do not fit leaving the support very loose. It feels as though one is leaning forward, making it difficult to use the machine effectively. Per other reviews, placing boards under the front end of the machine does help correct the problem, but when looking as the machine in use one can easily see that the foot pedals are angled down in the front when in use. Please do not be a naive as I was when buying this item. It is awful and a complete waste of money even if the price is only a little more than $100.00"
3,"Cheap , will do the work","It is cheap and will just about do the work if you are looking for something very very basic. You cannot changes the incline/resistance. No fancy gadgets/meters. Just a calorie , minutes, miles and time counter.I used it 10times in the past 6months...already the left handle keeps loosening up and I have to tighten it every minute or 2.A bolt came off the left step and the step shakes a bit.The resistance is adequate to get one started on an exercise regimen.Assembly was tricky even for my husband who is a DIY guy because the instructions are not good enough."
3,Parts Problem,"I got this elliptical trainer and assembled it easily, It moved very smoothly for the first two turns, then the right pedal (plastic) broke off. Glad I was holding the handles! Anyway, I called the makers and was told to email a copy of my Amazon receipt, they would send out a replacement. I did so, but never heard back. It's been over a week now so I made arrangements with Amazon to return it. I'm sad because it seemed to work so well."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,"I had this thing for only a few months and it fell apart. It was so poorly designed that one bit of metal sheared another part off. Trust me, it's cheap, and there's a reason it's cheap."
1,"Bought a second one, it too is broken. Clicks.","We bought this item last year and it made a clicking noise that was unbearable. The machine eventually made a grinding noise that sounded like it needed lubrication, and the friction made it unusable.So, thinking it was an isolated incident we bought another one last week. Well, I am sorry to say that the machine made the same clicking noise right out of the box. We can still use it, but the noise is very loud, just like the last one we purchased, and we expect this one to wear out just as the last one did in a very short time.We tried to save money but you get what you pay for I guess. Two times and two faulty machines. We will not buy it again, that's for sure."
4,"great , except....","this item was shipped super fast within a 5 day period, it was easy to assemble and to use, though part of the plastic part of the machine was cracked and broke off when i received it, that was the only downfall of my item."
1,Disappointing,I got this as a gift and as we put it together we noticed it was flimsy but figured couldn't be that bad. After using it slightly for ONLY TWO days the foot rest broke off! Very upset
2,You get what you pay for....,"I bought this in February and only got to use it until about June, when one of the foot holder/pedal things broke off (I havent been able to find a replacement). When I put the elliptical together it was very confusing and I ended up with extra pieces and no clue where they went. It was very unstable and I think the calorie counter was way off, it would say that I burned more calories in an hour than I had even consumed that day....The item did ship quickly though."
1,Junkyard Quality,"Over the years, I have bought some of the cheap stationary bikes, treadmills, and ellipticals. What I have noticed, is that they are made from extremely cheap materials. In this case, the metal was light and brittle, and cracked after only a few weeks of use. The whole machine felt junky, and it was. This is not even worth $10. At any price, this machine feels like junkyard scrap metal."
2,Eh its ok,This product came to me missing some nuts and a bolt. The instructions are not very detailed. The parts were not marked. As far as function...it leans forward and kind of bothers my back to lean that far. I think if I ever get around to it I can put something under the front to level it out. I do not weigh a lot but the machine sways a lot and is a bit tippy when I am using it. It does its job though. That is all i can ask for.
2,problem and sorry i purchased....,"well, i thought i was getting a good deal on this exercise bike for my daughter; it arrived in a timely manner and it was packaged well; but while putting it together, i realized they had sent me two of the same bolts, right's only and i needed a left bolt; so i called customer service and they were nice and promised to send one out to me; and they did-so i had one side already put together; was just waiting on the left bolt and when it arrived; it would not screw in; the threads are messed up or something else is not right; i can't get the bolt to screw in!!!so i've had this piece of fitness equipment for almost a year now and it has not been used! i wish i could return it but i quickly trashed the box it came in...sorry i purchased this; too many problems-"
1,JUNK,"ITS NOT LIKE THE ORBITREK, IT GOES FORWARD AND SLOPES DOWN TOO FAR, I CANT USE IT, AND I CANT AFFORD TO SEND IT BACK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK, ILL GIVE IT TO LUPUS"
5,Big bang for your buck,I am very impressed with this since it cost so little. I get a great workout just like when I use other machines. There was no instructions for the little digital timer that came with it. I have no idea what the distance or speed means. I'm very happy otherwise.
4,Good Cross Trainer,I really like this elliptical cross trainer. The size is compact enough that it doesn't take up a lot of room. My only complaint is that the instructions were not as clear as I would have liked. I wasted a bit of time trying to tighten the frame with the wrong tool because the directions did not state what I should use.
1,USELESS O STARS!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! WHOEVER ENGINEER THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT IN HIS/HER RIGHT MIND. THE ASSEMBLAGE IS IMPOSSIBLE. INSTRUCTIONS ARE UNCLEAR. ONE OF THE SCREWS IS ROUNDED ON ONE SIDE, SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PUT THE ACORN SCREW TO TIE IT. IT'S BY THE PEDAL AREA, SO IF YOU CAN'T SECURE THAT, YOUR ELLIPTICAL WILL GET SCREWED UP, AND YOU'LL RISK FALLING. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ASSEMBLE IT FOR THREE DAYS! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TIGHTEN THOSE SCREWS. I GUESS I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE IT!!! 150 GONE TO WASTE!"
1,Not so good,"1st machine received was missing about 50% of parts AND all hardware. Sent back to amazon for an exchange. Amazon was amazingly fast with that. 2nd machine seemed to have most of the parts (enough to make a functioning machine), instructions were horrible but I persisted. Day 1 = no problems, love this machine. Day 2 = no problems, still love this machine. Day 3 = mid-workout the left pedal snaps off toward the inside of the machine, trapping my ankle and causing me to fall. I now have a very bruised and swollen ankle. No longer love this machine."
1,Cheap is cheap,"I bought this in April, used it 3 to 6 times a week and by September it was broken. Unless you want something cheap to see if you'll stick with an elliptical, I would spend my money on better quality."
1,Waste of money,"hi all,I am pleasing and requesting all of them not to buy this confidence fitness. It is a waste of money and space in your house. This elliptical trainer is manufactured with defects and not worthy one. After a month, you will start hearing sounds in the pedals and the wheel will become so tight that you can do anything with this elliptical trainer. This product should be banned and the people who bought should open a dispute against this seller or the seller should recall this items and give atleast 50% of the money spent to buy this. The warranty period is also less just only for a month and returning this will also cost you more because of the weight. So please dont buy this if you really care about your money."
2,It will break on you,"I was so excited by it when I first got it. It gave me such a awesome workout and I loved it. However, after one month it started getting louder like there was something wrong with it. I looked and could not find anything wrong so I continued to use it with caution. Then one day it got very loud. Turns out the big wheel on front was loose and was hitting the sides of the casing. I have no clue on how to fix this and I can't use it. It was a waste of money. I wish I had never bought it."
1,loud psu: you get what you pay for,"This psu looks alright on paper and in person. However, after about five months of usage it started making this horrible high pitch noise. This is apparently a consistent problem with this model and other Altec PSUs."
3,Interesting,"I think the author inserted a little too much of her personal interpretations, but still it was an interesting read."
1,Complicated internet radio,"I am not of the ""digital computer generation."" Have an old computer. Attempted to download the cd that came with the radio. Nothing is working right. Probably my fault. But it is not like plugging in a radio and turning it on. Guess I'll keep on trying, but I hate every minute of it and IT'S JUST TOO COMPLICATED!. Just get a few old saggy stations and they have advertisments! Won't do that again. Just going to buy books from now on. The fellow who sold it to me has emailed and sent me some websites. But I am just flat tired of the whole thing."
1,Biggest piece of JUNK Ever!!!!,"Linksys could not have made a worse product. Terribly disappointed after much luck with their routers over the years.Save your money, but the Grace Digital Internet Radio. MUCH better, much easier setup, worth every penny."
2,Disappointed with Linksys,"This product doesnt support WPA Encryption, I would have to hardwire it in to the network or downgrade my network security settings to WEP; I cant do either of those two.As for the product itself, I liked the removable speakers and It is capable of searching the internet for live streaming media. However, the menu seems a bit ancient."
4,Great for what it is,"If one takes the time to do a little research on this product and upgrade the firmware you would find this a great radio for the money. I bought 3 units and have them scattered around the house, hooked into my wireless network. I'm very happy with them, they do what I desired which is to listen to internet radio. No problems updating the firmware, no problems getting them onto my wireless network. I'm happy with the sound of the speakers, I have one unit hooked into my stereo system One day I'll probably buy one of those $300+ units out there but for now I have more internet radio stations that I need"
2,Too early to market,"I am incensed that this very expensive player has an undocumented (and apparently unknown to Linksys customer service techs) 10 song limit on the playlists you can create. Sure, it's good to hook up Internet radio, but I've got 1000 songs on my computer and I painstakingly made them into playlists... only to hear the damn thing repeat after the first 10. Hours on the phone with tech support had me thinking something was wrong with MY computer. Later, by e-mail, I learn the thing only plays 10 songs. They should have disclosed this on the box... for a $180 product... and they CERTAINLY should have this documented for their tech support people. Linksys! I want my money, my time and my dignity back!"
3,Internet Radio,"Had trouble getting my computer to recognize this unit. Showed up on the router info, but the Linksys WMLS11B setup disk couldn't find unit. Finally figured out that I need to use the radio screen setup to tell the unit to use the ethernet cable instead of the wireless for initial setup. Didn't find this info in manual. After that, unit worked as desired."
2,i wished it worked,a good idea executed poorly. super buggy interface. have to reboot it to get a few minutes of net radio. so much for buffereing
1,Absolutely worthless,"What a waste of space. Restricted channels, very poorly supported by its Indian customer (non)'service' center. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...unless you'd like to try doing anything with mine !!! I am a Linksys devotee, but this is a terrible try at making something work.Always want you to upload firmware and then retry...horrible. It works if you only want the stations that are already in the system.Sounds OK though.There are much better solutions out there."
1,Impossible Setup,"Mine is going back. I can not get it to work. The documentation is useless, and the media server does not work worth a damn. Over an hour on customer support and no one there seems to know how to trouble shoot the device. Control your blood pressuse, Avoid this product!"
2,"Good idea, really bad product. DON'T BUY","I already had the network and I would say although I'm not brilliant, I am pretty computer savy. Forget this thing. It's so frustrating because it's such a great idea. I actually had it up and running for a weekend. I kept getting ""download error"" when I tried upgrading the firmware (on THREE computers!). But it worked OK without the upgrade. I told myself I could live without playlists.....But now more than 90% of the time I get ""Rhapsody is being accessed by another program"". Doesn't matter how many times I power cycle the computer and Rhapsody. Or I get my other Fave ""file format error"". It's really too bad - I had such high hopes for this."
1,No support from Linksys tech support,"Device hooked up and Rhapsody radio stations would not play. when e-mailed tech support, they caimed I should go to Rhapsody to ""fine tune"" the Rhapsody client. They were not able to help in any way and refused to send me to second level tech support or to offer an opion on removal re-install of product. This product is not ready for the market and potential purchasers are warned that if they want the Rhapsody radio stations they will be disapointed."
1,poor performer,"after spending 5 hours with linksys tech support, wmls11b would not work, nor could Linksys tech support give me any reason why this unit would not work. i knew more about wi-fi and mp3 formats than the 4 tech support personal, i talk to. i currently have a linksys media adparter wma11b, and had no problem with setting up. the software that comes with the wmls11b is very poor. Linksys need to go back and start over with this product. the concept is very good, but Linksys hardware and software all wrong"
1,"Really disappointed, it's going back.","I was really disappointed after I finally got it working. The device itself crashes frequently (even before it connects up to the computer), the display is tiny and hard to read if you are even a little off angle, and the included speakers sound like what they are, cheap computer speakers. Sending it back and going to get a Squeezebox Music Player instead even though it's a few bucks more."
2,A Waste of Money,"I am very disappointed with this product. Good thing I was a DJ for many years because I have knowledge of running wires all over the place! I actually laughed when I had all of the wires in place on this unit; the back looked like I had just assembled an entire entertainment center! On top of all that, you have to read the instructions very carefully, oh and make sure you find that silly switch to flip (which is not easy) before you hook it up via ethernet cable for the initial installation. Bottom line, you need to jump through too many hoops to get this thing to sing for you. Good Luck!"
2,Nice idea; flawed execution,"What a great concept! I can take this very portable device anywhere within reach of my wireless router and have streaming music from my digital library or Internet radio stations.Here's the reality (as I have experienced it): even after upgrading to the latest firmware, my WMLS11B will not stay connected to my wireless network. I have to re-enable the SSID every time I turn the device on to get an initial connection. From then on, streaming music stops and starts as though the connection were spotty, even though my laptop (also on the wireless and sitting next to the device) is streaming beautifully.In addition, the WMLS11B will only receive Internet radio stations that broadcast as strict mp3's. Which means no .pls, no .asx, etc. Unfortunately, this is what most streaming formats are in.Luckily, the speakers are powered and are connected to the wireless device by standard RCA jacks. I use this product now primarily as a way to play songs from my iPod nano."
4,Works like a charm but room for improvement,"This device does what it is advertised to do: serve music over a wireless network. I had no difficulties setting up with a Netgear wireless router and encryption. The whole process took maybe 20 minutes, but only because I was carefully double-checking the progress at every step.My only complaint is that the interface has a mildly awkward menu system, but it's easy to get used to. There's a nice option to browse by Artist / (sub-menus) Album, which is perfect if you just want to play a particular album. You can also choose to play all saved tracks from a single artist (based on tags), or your whole collection. In those cases, the default is to play the tracks in alphabetical order by tag-title, but you can select a shuffle mode for random selection of tracks.The device is very portable and is easy to connect to a receiver. Shame that it can't be powered by batteries; the extra portability would have been handy!"
3,Love it,I would have given it a four if it was easier to hook up. Once it is hooked up it works great. I think for the price it is a great gadget. I bought two.
2,Unreliable. Poor UI,"I have had lots of trouble with the WMLS11B. In general connecting to internet radio has always worked, over either wired or wireless. The limited testing of wired connection to PC seems to have worked. Wireless connection has been at best intermittent. Tech support was not helpful.I finally found a PC networking option that I didn't have loaded -""Service Advertising Protocol"". Why it worked sometimes without this I have no idea. Why it is needed and not loaded by the install I have no idea.I hope this helps someone.Peter"
1,"Wanted it so bad, but no luck","Product worked fine when wired up into my network (although I didn't try a playlist to see if it had the 10 song problem or not) and even played Internet Radio when it connected to my neighbor's wireless network accidentally. But the device absolutely refused to see my Adaptec Wireless Access Point. Every other wireless device I've had in the house sees it no problem. Not this thing. Worked with tech support, no dice. On my own before I called them, I tried upgrading firmware, changing the settings many times, I even opened up my access point every which way (security off, etc.). The WMLS11B never saw my SSID in its Site Survey (although it did pick up a neighbor's from about 150-200 feet away.) Sent back this morning."
5,Great Inspiration,"This and the other Nordstrom book are amazing inspiration in the field of Customer Service. You don't need to read both of them, since they have a lot of the same info in them, but they should be read by anyone who wants to improve their Customer Service whether in their own business or as a manager looking to increase sales and CS."
5,very enjoyable book while in seattle watching Nordstrom work,a quality professional will appreciate this book. a fast read focusing on customer satisfaction from a supplier's point of view. very appropriate for all retail business. manufacturers can learn a lot also in treating both internal and external customers. the book points out what can be learned and what should come with the package. attitude and motivation coupled with learned skills spell success. all shoe salesmen should be so driven
5,A Worthwhile Look into the Nordstrom Culture,"The Nordstrom Way was not developed overnight. It has been four generations and over one hundred years in the making. It is a culture, not an act that can be turned on and off. It is a pleasure also to have its recent top salesman Patrick McCarthy share his story.The Nordstrom Way oozes with pride... the pride of providing a top-rate retail experience. Salesmen are empowered to make decisions. This is not just lip service. They carry a card which states ""Rule #1: Use your good judgement in all situations. There will be no additional rules."" Emphasis is given to placing the needs of the customer ahead of short-term profits.Other aspects of this 'culture' include promoting only from within and profit-sharing.Most retail outlets have a small Customer Service department. At Nordstrom, the whole store is the Customer service department.The Nordstrom Way embodies simple concepts that are not necessarily easy for other companies to duplicate.Five Stars"
5,Love it,I love this necklace. It is very versatile within my wardrobe and can be worn year round. The flower dresses up a plain outfit and gives a nice added sparkle. It is much more beautiful in person than in the picture. I have been very impressed with it's beauty.
4,Beautiful necklace but sharp edges,"Beautiful necklace, can easily be worn with both casual and formal clothing. Size is perfect - not too large. The chain was fine for me, definitely held the weight of the necklace. Only caveat about this necklace is that the edges are quite sharp and can scratch you. I've been tempted to file down the edges... I'll update should I do so."
3,Larger than you might expect (at least what I expected),"No dimension is given on the page about the size of the flower itself. From the picture I expected a small, delicate flower and this is a large pendant. It is pretty, but bigger than I was looking for. I would give the dimensions, but I returned it (and had to pay return shipping) and don't know what the actual measurement is."
3,It looks cheap up close,I did get a lot of compliments. I ended up giving it to my sister in law which was who I bought it for in the first place
3,Very Shiny,"The pendant was large and very pretty, but the chain was very thin and cheep. It broke before I was able to wear it."
5,Perfect,"Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas.It is absolutely gorgeous in person, the chain has held up well so far and she is in love with it."
3,Pretty but looks a little cheap.,"I ordered this necklace for my daughter. When it arrived, I was dissapointed. The chain seems very cheap. The flower is very pretty though. My daughter did love it, so I suppose it was worth it. The price seemed a little high for the cheap chain."
3,Just Okay,The medallion was bigger than it looked and the chain was very thin. I would have liked to have seen it on a model.
4,Very dramatic,"This is a beautiful, attention-getting product. I sometimes replace the chain with a silver or ice-blue ribbon, and strangers stop to compliment me on it. Beware: your friends and family will want you to buy them one too."
4,decent for the price,"as others have mentioned, this pendant is bigger than expected. it measures a little more than 1 inch across. the chain is flimsy with a weak clasp that doesn't open and close well.but that said, the piece is simple and nice. hope it was a little cheaper though."
5,Beautiful necklace,"I love this necklace, I wasn't sure what to expect for the price, I usually end up with jewelry that becomes unwearable pretty quick because I don't like to spend too much on necklaces, especially chains, having a 2 year old since a lot of times they get ripped off by mistake. This is very beautiful and looks like it could sell for double its price and still be worth it to me. I love it."
4,Beautiful,"I LOVE this necklace. It's very elegant and yes the chain is very tiny and feels much too delicate, but anything thicker would detract from the pendant. Beautiful."
5,Beautiful!,"I love this necklace! I get compliments on it every time I wear it. Some other reviewers have complained about the chain, but I liked the fact that the end of the chain has several loops to hook to, so you can adjust the length of the necklace to fit with different necklines."
4,Beautiful,"I think this is just a beautiful piece. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the chain that is comes on is very delicate and a piece like this needs a more substantial chain. Change out the chain and you have yourself a wonderful piece of jewelry.To answer the question of demention, the flower is an 1 1/2 inches across at it widest point."
3,"Nice pendant, bad chain","Like many others, I have mixed feelings about this item. The pendant is very pretty (although a little larger than I expected), but the chain that comes with it is ridiculous! It's much too thin and looks like it can barely support the weight of the pendant. I immediately swapped it out for a thicker, longer chain and now I'm pleased with my purchase. If it weren't for the chain problem, I would give this item 4 stars instead of 3."
4,"Good Product, Late Delivery","The product came as promised, perfect in tact, complete with unbroken chain and black velvet carrying bag. However, it came a week later than the shown date."
2,Looks better on web,"The pendant looks 100 times better in Amazon website, compared to the stale look in normal daylight. Supplied chain is a joke. If you paid the normal retail price for this pendant, shame on you."
4,Beautiful,Its beautiful & its priced right. However either the chain should be made better or it should be made available without a chain.
3,Not too happy,This is a larger-sized pendant. I should've read all of the reviews and not just the first few. I really think that the pendant is too large. I also think that it looks a little cheap (I guess that's what you get for $29). I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Size not stated,"I ordered this as a gift and unfortunately the description did not include the size of the pendant anywhere. It came, the pendant was beautiful, the chain of poor quality as others have stated and WAY TOO BIG for the person the gift was intended for. If you are looking for a smaller type pendant keep in mind this one is a good 1 1/2 inches wide."
2,Returned it...,"The pendant was VERY big, almost the size of a 50-cent piece. If they had included the size in the description I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Too large,The pendant is a nice design but it is difficult to know the size of the pendant from the add. It is about 1.5 inches in diameter on a disproportionately light chain. I was expecting a pendant perhaps less than 25% the size. Size is a critcal element left out of the add. This is an important consideration because of the taste of the buyer and the style that best suits the wearer. I returned the item disappointed and out the cost of shipping.
4,Nice but over rated,Its a nice item but I was expecting a bit more for what I paid. At least she liked it.
3,"Attractive, but painful","The necklace came as promised with no defects or delay. It looked just as good as it did in the picture, but unfortunately was not made to be worn on bare skin. I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas and the points on the edges of the flowers scratched her skin. After a day of wearing the necklace with a low-cut shirt, her chest was red. It is a beautiful necklace though, so I would recommend it for someone planning to wear it on a shirt, not on bare skin."
5,Delicate but not tiny,I was pleasantly surprised when my husband bought this off my wish list. I thought it was going to be a little large and after reading the reviews was worried about the chain as well. I'm glad to be wrong- it's lovely. It's delicate and pretty without being frail (in looks or handling). It's also very eyecatching and I get asked about it every time I wear it.
2,The picture is very misleading,"When this arrived I took it out of it's box and was extremely disappointed, the pendant looks cheaply made (in some parts the metal isn't even smooth) thats all here really is to say. This might be impressive to middle and high school students but I wouldn't recommend giving it to your spouse or a relative."
2,Not very sturdy,I bought this necklace because it would look good with a lot of my clothes but upon receiving it i noticed that it was not very sturdy and could easily be broken by a child. The flower itself is kind of flimsy.
3,Flower Necklace.,I bought this flower necklace. It is very pretty and looks nice on. The only problem is that the places where the petals come to a point are a little sharp. (It rubs and irritates the skin.) This makes the flower necklace uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.
3,"Cute, but free chain is verythin","I bought this for my wife, the pendent is great, it looks nice and seems to to be worth the price, but the free chain that is included is very thin and low quality...stuck out like a sore thumb when she opened the gift, ""oh this chain is really bad"". Took the glory away form the pendent."
4,Seriously Safe,"My girlfriend was adamant that I purchase a snorkel vest because I go out in the water by myself for hours at a time. The vest offers high visibility and provides you with pockets so you don't have to leave anything too important on the beach... like a hotel room key. Once when I used it without a rash guard, I got some chafing. I have had some issues with getting air out of it while in the water which caused me to have to come up sooner during a dive, but I feel that is a trade off for a vest that could really do me some good if I got caught in a situation that I needed to use it for floatation. This is a nicely made product that can still fold down nicely for travel."
4,good vest,"This vest worked well - although it tends to ""ride up"" a bit, but it certainly was worth the money"
4,Worth the expense,"This foundation is the only powder I have found that provides enough coverage without looking caked on and without causing breakouts. It lasts all day (when I wash my face at night, foundation still comes off on the washcloth) but still looks natural and is easy to wear. (Note that I also use the primer underneath the foundation). I use a large powder brush instead of the enclosed sponge or puff. The sponge didn't give enough coverage and the puff didn't lead to even application. The downside to using the brush is that it wastes excess powder. The powder doesn't last as long as some other foundations so I have to buy it more frequently but it is worth the money."
5,Love love love Laura mercier,"I loved both Laura mercier products that I received. As described and much easier than going into the department stores. I already knew my shades so that was helpful. Seller shipped fast I was worried about the compact breaking, they are so fragile, but everything arrived safely packaged. Thank you. Will buy again!!"
2,"Bad color match, too sheer, and streaked","I bought the lightest color (#1) hoping that it would work for me, but it was waaaaay too yellow, which is often a problem I have with foundation (drugstore and department store). Further, even though I moisturized, this stuff went on streaky (even with a slightly damp sponge). Granted, it's been a while since I've used powder foundations, but there was a time when Oil of Olay was making one and it applied like a dream (sort of creamy, even though it was a powder). I got extremely light coverage with this, and no real avenue for building in areas where I might need a little more. It just streaked and was hard to control. My experience with powder foundations is that you can easily get medium coverage, with the option of sheering it out. This product went on streaky and very sheer. I could buff out the streaks, but was left with ultra sheer coverage...akin to a tinted setting powder."
5,Fantastic!,I love Laura Mercier! The powder still allows my skin to breath and not look like it is coated in makeup.
2,not good,too cumbersome to put on.what I was looking for was an athletic support ....this one was not that good .I bought the other futoro control knee support and this one (much cheaper ) was much better
3,The Animals - 'Ark' (Castle) 3 1/2 stars,"Decent 1983 reunion comeback effort.I remember when this album first came out.The critics hated it but many fans(like myself)thought it was okay.If anything,the long-running British blues rock five piece band's sound was more mature than their '60's material.Some of the tunes I liked were ""The Night""(still see the video on VH1 Classic upon occasion),""Love Is For All Time"",""Hard Times"" and ""Crystal Nights"".Enjoy because I seriously doubt they'll ever reunite again."
5,This is my favorite,"Great CD. When it came out, it was rated ""party ablum of the year"" by Playboy. Heavy orchestrations, good music. Any Animals fan will love it - It was also their last studio album as a group."
1,"Don't get this, too easy to slip","This is bad, very bad. It slips so easy that you cannot get a firm grip on the filter. I would suggest anyone to look elsewhere and get something else that actually works. I really regret getting this."
1,filter wrench,this tool is worthless i am sorry for ever buyin it.the tool bends very easily and the gears slip fast .
4,serves it's purpose,"would be nice if a stand was included with this. bought for a prop for a project, didn't have a way to stand it up."
5,I love this CD and I haven't taken it out of my cd player,"This CD is relaxing, fun and takes me away. The feeling I get from it is happiness. I love the music. Every song is so different. I""m never bored."
3,A Good Coffee Table Book,"This book is not meant to be extensive in its coverage nor deep in its scope. However, it is a nice coffee table book about Freemasonry that could grace any table of any Mason. It is certainly lavishly illustrated."
4,Where is my Blue Cover...,"Another book filled with information, but I received a red covered book instead of the blue cover I wanted..."
3,Let's All Thumb It!,"I enjoyed this book for its escapism. Obviously, Wald has much experience in hitching, and enjoys sharing his stories and ""expertise."" Couple of things: it was never clear to me what motivated him to subject himself to the dangers and discomforts--gathering material for a book I guess. He really makes light of the liklihood of being murdered or worse(?). Seems to me a fair percentage of those willing to stop for a hitchhiker might very well ""be up to no good."" That said, it's interesting to get one's mind around this--without having to do it!"
3,one song really grabs me,I heard Iceblink- Pass into Silence on Pandora and it just takes me somewhere I can't explain so bought this CD hoping the rest of it was the same. Only that one song really speaks to me. The rest of the songs are very interesting. I may need to do a few more listens to fully appreciate them.
5,A first-rate performance,"This recording very effectively captures Michael's ability to captivate his audience with songs of humor, joy, and melancholy. He shows an uncanny sense of timing and mood. Quite possibly one of the best live recordings I've heard from any artist. Purchase this, and you'll be privy to one of the best-kept secrets in the music world."
1,STUPID,I got this toy for my birthday....it is the alltime most ugly thing I have ever seen!what is she an alian?
1,Yuck,This barbie is ugly and it has short ugly hair. It's smelly and it brakes fast.BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
4,Michael looks like losing his touch,"Michael's Final Venture is not as exciting as I expected it to be. First, it lacks the thrill of a financial market background. While the whole story is built around the venture capital firm, but seriously, anyone can write such a story. I expect more on financial market story from Michael.And how Simon solve the murder case seems to be too easy, with help just around the corner when he needs it. He seems to be able to rope in the person he needs to help him solved the murder case, which I think it is unlikely in real life (but this is a fiction anyway).I hope that Michael will do better in his next book."
4,"Quite good, yet not his best work yet","Having read all Mr. Ridpath's previous books I was quite happy to find a new book of his being published. It was a very good read, I finished it in 3 nights and a short train ride. Once you start it's really hard to put down. The only negative part is that in the end I felt there was no way you could have found the guilty party by yourself. That's the reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars."
4,Great book for anyone with a curiosity in Hitler's medical problems,"Extremely insightful book on Morell and Hiter's relationship. While reading this book I never found myself bored. This book is well written and intriguing, and I will recommend it to my friends. I think this book is worth the buy, as it has Morell's letters and diaries. I love that this book utilizes primary sources, unlike many other books out there which use so many secondary sources that the real history is totally diluted. The back of the book has a list of Hitler's medications (methamphetamines, amphetamines and cocaine are among the medications listed) and Morell's diaries and letters, as well as a list of all the checkups. Irving is extremely thorough in gathering all this information. You really wouldn't get this amount of info in 50 other books altogether about Morell. Total recommendation from me!"
3,Nikon 7519 Monarch 12 X 56 MM All-Terrain Binoculars,"What a bargin! My other Nikon Monarch binoculars have been very good quality for their cost and have proven to be tough. But the pair of 12X50s I got was disappointing.The focus wheel was very stiff and sticky making it impossible to hold the image still while focusing. And there were donut distortions in both lenses at all focus points. To their credit the image sharpness was B+ and the CA was very low.So, back to Amazon. The search continues."
4,While they last,Like these 12X56's as great complement to 8X42's.Mine included the tri-pod adaptor in the box. Handy for backyard birding on the tripod with 8x42 for hh. It's helpful to have for comparison with your hand holding and with what IS would do for you.Nikon is redesigning the ATB lineup and at time of writing this model is being sold out of inventory. You might check their website for a replacement version.
2,Pass on these,"I got these as I love the Nikon Monarch rifle scopes. These are very huge and not as clear and sharp in low light as I would have hoped.I have awesome 10x pair that leupold makes but, wanted just a tad more reach when hunting and trying to age wildlife on the hoof. These are so big that its impossible to hold them still long. That are a little impractical to carry around your neck too.Spend a little more money and get a much better pair of 10x."
2,"depends on the day, it works and sometimes rusty water comes out","I have always been a fan of T Fal, never have a problem but this iron is just really bad. When it works, it works but after just a year, the rusty water comes out and ruin some clothes. I just cant believe it. I tried de scaling and cleaning the plate but the problem continues.. Sadly..."
3,Amazon.com sent me a used Iron (not even a refurbished one!),Amazon sent me a used Iron while the condition mentioned at the time of ordering was new! Be careful!
2,"OK, but not close to OEM","It was cheap, but it is cheap. It vibrates and is not nearly as stable as the one that came with the car, and it whistles because it was not designed well enough. There is a line or a hole or something that whistles at any speed over about 25 mph and is quite annoying."
4,Off to the Cirkus,"If you liked ""Earthbound,"" you'll love this, for the sound is superior in most places. I've always liked this line-up of KC because it was the last to use the jazzy sax-mellotron-flute texture of the original KC (plus, it was the first line-up I saw live: Denver, March 1972). The album lacks the song for which is album is named, and halfway through the final track of disc two there is an inexplicable minute of silence, resuming only to break off mid-solo rather than conclude with the final verse. Aside from these bizarre editing decisions, this is a splendid anthology of performances."
2,"First album = jazzy, good; second album = just plain obnoxious.","The title says it all. The first of the two albums would unquestionably be worth getting on its own--great live music from an under-represented period of the band's history, although personally the jazzier, more saxophone-heavy Crimson isn't to my liking as much as the later, proggier bits. When you stick the second album into the mix, it's a crap shoot. If you really like early 70's King Crimson improvisations with lots of saxophone, you might like that second album. Personally, I've listened to it two or three times, generally wishing halfway through that I hadn't stuck it in the cd player and only listening the whole way through because of some combination of laziness and determination."
2,Does not contain the title song,"If you're jonesing for the classic song ""Ladies of the Road"", the CD you want is _Islands_. Don't make the same mistake I did; buy that one first.This CD is for hard-core Crimson fans who have all the classic gems already."
5,Bargain Bike,This bike is a must for apartment dwellers who want to keep in shape and do some aerobic exercise. I will be 82 yrs.old and knee and hip replacements restrict me to non- impact exercise. This eliminates long walks and treadmills. This bike is very well made and is about $200 cheaper than comparable bikes that are much more bulky and heavier ones on sale at retail stores. If you buy one of those you are wasting your money. Definitely 5 stars for this one!
1,Not Meant for Serious Excercise,"As far as the assembly-all of the other reviews are correct. It is easy to assemble etc., etc. My problem is that I have used this bike for a total of 23 days. On most days I have burned 900 calories per day. Low and behold I need a new bike because there are some rubber pieces/ashes falling out of the bottom of the ""wheel"", and now every time I pedal there is an annoying jerk that occurs, which messes up my speed/time. You probably want to invest money in this item only if you are going to ""pretend"" to get some excercise."
2,Product Review.,"I am writing this review on behalf of my wife who purchased this exercise bike for her personel use. One cannot be too critical, considering what she paid for this product. The assembly was straight forward and went well. The X-Bike will definitely exact the exercise you need. The biggest con with this product is the fact that the seat is unconfortable after a few minutes. I would strongly recommend purchasing a padded seat cushion along with this X-bike. Additionally a heart rate monitor would be a very usefull accessory."
1,don't waste your money and time,"I ignored the the negative reviews and ordered my bike. I was very happy about the product, assembly was not very complicated buuuuuuuuut I used it only twice at the lowest speed and it locked, the pedals would not move at all.Had to take it apart and ship it back. BIG hassle!"
4,Great bike for the price!,I have had this bike for a few days now and I love it. I love being able to watch TV while riding. I don't find any problems with the resistance. It is enough for me! I don't know how long it will last but it does seem sturdy and fairly well made.
4,Great buy,"This foldable exercise bike lived up to its description and for this price, its a steal. The only problem I had was the fact that they sent the wrong gel seat cover. I purchased the set so shouldn't I get the correct size? You really need it because the original seat is a bit tough on your rear end."
4,Nice purchase,The bike was pretty easy to put together although I had to have help from my brother. The ride is so smooth and there is no noise. I love the compact size. The only negative would be the shipping cost was $40.00.
3,Not good for fit people,"The tension on this bike (1-8) does not go high enough for me to get a good workout. I like to do interval training, but this will only be good for low, slow cardio. Also, my monitor does not work properly, only half the numbers show.Other than that, the bike seems sturdy and quiet. (But the directions for putting it together reek!) I think the seat is fine, but I got the Sunlite Cloud Nine cover, and it fit perfectly."
3,I was disapointed.,"Just got it 2 days ago and it is not at all what I expected. Seat is way to high and quite hard. It was a tough machine to set up and if not for the fact that it'd cost me 40 bucks to ship it back, it wouldn't be sitting in my living room. Another thing, the box looked like someone had kicked it back already, all nasty and taped up. I was leary to accept the delivery for that reason alone!! I've gotten up on the thing 4x and am trying to give it a chance, but it does not feel good. I hope it gets more comfortable to use, but whoever said the seat comfortable is nuts (maybe compared to wood or bare metal. I only hope it grows on me. For that reason alone I'll give it a VERY GENEROUS THREE STARS"
3,Belt only lasted 1 year,"I bought this bike because it would give me winter cardio and save space. It was fine (the seat is really uncomfortable) and a good beginner bike, as the reviews say, but after a year, the belt frayed on the bike and I can't find any way to replace it (no part number, no owner's manual etc). So the bike is getting junked and I'm going with another brand."
2,A Bit Short To Ride Comfortably For My Average Height,"The product is not quite what I hoped, but will keep if the seat can be raised higher. The seat is not adjustable such that I would have liked one more drilled hole so the seat is higher by 2 inches. I am 5 foot 6, but my knees are still bent a lot on the highest setting. I called the company and am waiting for a call back from the company, hoping for some assistance to see if the seat can be higher. I spent three hours assembling the bike, which was eventually successful. I called the company who said I had an outdated instruction manual. The instructions were not matching all the parts. It referenced spring washers, which are no longer used. Customer service gave me some assistance. The Nyloc nuts took a lot of effort, over an hour, to thread with the wrench. The wrench which was a bit long to get inside the seat area to tighten well."
4,bike,Love that this bike folds up. Very easy to put together. Everyone says the seat is uncomfortable but I don't mind it at all. I love this bike.
3,Not working properly... Help,"Started using product first week of jan. used product about 3-5x week...NOW the bike makes a very loud clicking and grinding noise. I'm so disappointed because I REALLY enjoyed the bike, but now I can't use it and I can't return it because I've used it. If theres anything I can do please help!!"
4,A good value but questions its long term reliability,"I have this bike for about three months. It works well especially considering its low price. I do, however, have doubt regarding its long-term durability. Its computer stopped working, in addition to some squeaky noises starting to appear."
2,Confidence Fitness Space Saving bike,"The bike's computer monitor has never worked, even brand new, after one month of use it began making a clicking noise, and the right pedal has come lose on its own. The manufactures were contacted by email twice to see what they would do to solve the problem (the bike was a gift and bought in advance, so the return policy had expired) but they never replied."
2,Loved it while it worked,"I absolutely loved this bicycle for the month that it worked. I suppose I used it too much (around 90 minutes a day) because the bike soon became loud and very choppy when I rode it.It was easy to assemble, took up almost no room at all, and was incredibly light.I'm sad that the bike fell apart, because it was such a pleasure to exercise on it and so much less trouble than a full size stationary bicycle."
4,Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike,I love my Exercise Bike I try to use it at least 4 days a week. Not only was it not expensive but it takes up very little room in my bedroom. I tried looking for this type bike in various stores and the saleman would look at me funny whenever I said I wanted a foldable bike. The bikes they wanted to sell me were about $400 or more and they were so big no way would I want them in my bedroom. I am very happy with my stow away excercise bike.
3,It is what it claims,"This is a nice product. It arrived very quickly and in very good condition. The shipping price is terrible, I would make a more thorough search before purchasing here."
4,Surprising good...........,"It was very easy to put together, did it in under 1 hour. There was several damaged pieces due to shipping. There wasn't enough or proper packing, it's not pretty very dinged but serviceable."
2,light and works ok but too tall,"works ok, I guess, but is way too high even after adjustments, and I am 5'5"". My 20 y.o son is 5;10"", and he also said bike is too high. For me it is hard to get in/out,, and i feel I have to strain my back and arms to balance on it"
4,Gets the job done.,"I chose this bike because it was space-saving (fits in my closet) and received good ratings, for the most part. It isn't a great piece of equipment, being used to high-end gym machines; however, it gets the job done. I've been using it every day for two weeks now and it gets my heart-rate up sufficiently. The resistance is great--I push it up to 5 when I want the extra challenge, mind you--I am in my twenties and in decent shape, so there is plenty of resistance left to work up to. However, the seat is horribly uncomfortable and a pillow just doesn't do it, so I would recommend buying a gel seat with the bike. I'd say it is worth the money if you cannot get to (or afford) the gym."
5,Great Investment,"This bike is fantastic, the far best purchase I've made in a long time. This bike arrived quickly in great shape an exceeded my expectations. I read the other reviews and despite the negative ones I still made the purchase. Fortunately I don't have any problems, the bike's quite and the tension settings are fine. At first they seemed too easy, but after a while they almost seemed to tense up. It's an ideal bike especially for the price and I love it."
4,Good for the money!,"The bike is great, exactly what I wanted.However, the small bar that locks the bike into a folded position came bent...so it doesn't go through all of the holes...and I cannot find a manual that came with it. Does anyone know a number I could call? Thanks!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"This bike came on time and that was the only redeeming thing about it. My husband is an engineer so I lucked out. He had to completely rework the flywheel part of the bike because it would not even turn! The ball bearings on pedals are bad as well.This bike is made for a tall person, which I am not. The lowest setting on the bike seat is still a bit hard for me to get up on and I am 5ft 1in. The handlebars are positioned way too far forward too.The shipping to return it is too much so my husband is basically remaking it for me. For 140.00 one should not have to rework anything!!! Very disappointed!!!"
4,"Very nice, stable folding exercise bike","I would have given 5 stars except that when the bike arrived I could not screw in one of the pedals because the thread in the hole was bad. I had to obtain a pedal tap to clean it up (this was a lot easier than returning the whole bike by UPS for repair or replacement).Otherwise I really like this bike - it's convenient, comfortable, stable even for large people like me. Easy to assemble, very easy to fold/unfold. The tension and electronics work fine.Only caution - if you're over about 5'8"" I think even the tallest seat setting might be too low for comfortable pedaling."
2,Not comfortable!,"The ratings for this item looked amazing. Yet, I did not really find it comfortable. It is not ergonomic. Assembly was easy; but something is wrong with the way it stands. The two legs does not touch the floor evenly."
1,TOO HARD TO PEDAL,This bike is a real disappointment. I'm 190 lb and work out regularly and like to bike for hours which is impossible to do on this bike since it is very hard to pedal even on the lowest setting. Waste of $$$.
2,Made in China,"The computer does not have an ""off"" switch so you just waste batteries while it waits 4 minutes and turns off on its own.The whole unit has a toxic, chemical smell that I notice from across the room. I was worried that it might be dangerous so I looked into it. It turns out that it is made in China. Given China's history or selling products made of unregulated, dangerous materials that they sell to the US I grew more concerned. I contacted the manufacturer asking what the bike is made out of. They rudely said steel and plastic and that there is no such thing as an American Made exercise bike. It clearly is made out more than plastic and steel so I guess I just get to wonder what is causing the toxic smell from the bike. Also, a 43 second search in the internet proved that there are lots of exercise bikes sold in the US that are not made in China.I would not reccomend this bike."
3,Good beginner bike,"I bought this bike after reading all of the other reviews about it. I found all of the critiques to be accurate (it's a little small for anyone over 5'10"" and the shipping is pricey). My biggest complaint about the bike, though, is the tension setting. Only a couple of reviewers made any mention of it. I've used the bike several times and I have to set it to the highest tension to get a decent workout. I'm a bit disappointed that I don't have anything to work up to - and I'm even not an avid biker or exerciser! I'm 34 in good health and participate in low to moderate physical activity. I do not recommend this bike to people who are looking for gym-quality exercise bike. However, this is a great bike for people who are looking to get a little cardio exercise at home or who may be just getting back into exercising/physical activity."
2,product life,"I purchased this product 1 1/2 to 2 years ago for home use for myself--only. It now makes rattling noise and my husband grumbles about the bearing breaking. Without taking the entire bike apart, there's no way to tell if it's even repairable. Are parts availabe???It doesn't take up much space but it apparently does not hold up daily use."
3,What you'd expect,"Really no complaints here. This is an inexpensive bike, and you'll get exactly what you pay for.Positives:-Small.-Easily stored and put away.-Easily assembled.-Fairly quiet (though not as silent as other reviews imply).-Basic bread-and-butter bike; no useless bells and whistles.Negatives:-Doesn't ride smoothly when resistance is increased.-Resistance doesn't differ much as you change levels.-Calorie counter is so laughably off that it's of no use whatsoever.-Seat can be adjusted only minimally. I'm 6ft, and the bike is a bit too small for me."
2,"It WAS good, but a very bad long-term investment","It worked fine when I first got it. But now I have a clunk every time I pedal. The seat is hard as a dang rock. I bought this for a quick cheap cardio fix for my cousins wedding but next year I am buying something much more expensive. This is not a long term piece of equipment. The computer is extremely inaccurate except for the timer. It is still pretty heavy, so don't expect it to be light to move around. So, I don't know. You get what you pay for, but it's not something that will last a long time, just keep that in mind."
2,"Deceptive, not really magnetic resistance","Yes, it is a good form factor but it lacks what is central to an exercise bike, inertia and low friction.To me it feels like a very cheap form of friction resistance that is uniform and thus unsatisfying."
5,NICE EXERCISE BIKE...,"This bike is for smaller people. I am 5'3"" and it fits me great. Other bikes have been discarded because they were just too big. The only down side is the seat. A bit small and too hard. But for the price no big deal.... $129 free ship. I even used some rewards and got $50 off. I am replacing the seat and still feel I got a terrific bargain. It was very easy to put together. Didn't have to call my husband once! I highly recommend this product. Reasonably priced, sturdy, seems well built and you can even understand the instructions."
5,Best Little Bike for Home!,"I love, love, love this bike. I love that I can collapse it and stick it in a corner or a closet. I can now ride while I am watching the news in the morning or at night while I'm reading and then fold it up and stick it in the corner.On a side note, make sure you purchase a beach cruiser gel cushion to compliment the bike seat. The original seat alone is hard and not comfortable at all.The seat is adjustable and it also has a meter to track calories burned.In addition, it is also easy to assemble and has different levels of difficulty.As stated in the title, it's the best little bike for your home."
2,I should take the other people's review seriously.,"it started making noise after 3 days of lightly use, won't expect it will last long until the next year. Those people who gave it five stars must be working for this company. I would rather pay more to look for another one if I have a choice."
3,pretty average,"Just got this a couple of weeks ago. Its OK I guess. I'm 6'0 and I wish the seat went up another notch or two. One of the parts bent in transit and I also got 1 bolt that was the incorrect size. It does fold, but you don't save a massive amount of space by folding it. It is pretty light if you want to move it around though.The whole thing feels pretty cheap (which it was to be fair), hence the 3 star rating. But overall, for the money ($139) its reasonable."
1,KenKeller,"Peddle fell apart during the first day of use. It did not fall off, but rather fell apart with a multitude of tiny ball bearings rolling all over the place, several nuts and a washer and no possible way of reassembly. Item was assembled correctly with right peddle on right side and left on the left."
1,Updated review,"I originally gave this item 5 stars. It is small. Lightweight and works very well. It was initially very quite as well and easy to assemble. I only had it a MONTH and it started making a ""clunking"" noise. Then the pedals froze while I was riding. Now, I only weigh 110 and use it 20 minutes a day to tone. I would say that I definitely did not put a strain on it. Called Amazon and they are sending a replacement which will arrive in 2 days and I will pack this one up and send it back. I am hoping that this one lasts longer then the first one did as I really do like the bike. So, if you don't see anymore updates, it is working fine again. If it dies again, I will let you know and will purchase something else."
3,Terrible noise,"Ok so I wont give this less than 3 stars, because it did last me around 9 months. I mean I still use it now, but it makes a horrible noise. At first it was great, but a few months in the black shavings started to come out from it somewhere, and I had to put a towel under the front when I used it because it was such a mess. In addition to this at high settings it made this horrible squeaking noise so I just lowered it which mean an easier exercise. Then it started to make the noise at lower settings, now if I used it, it is at a low setting and it makes the horrible noise. I will put up with the noise until I get a new bike. Overall if I went back I would have bought something else, but this wasnt completely useless."
2,Beyond expection but fail after two weeks,"Easy to install, quiet, sturdy yet it doesn't take up much space. Many reviews have durability concern but I think it will be fine espacially for only $140.Beware! It broke after only two weeks, had to return, much trouble."
1,Fell apart!,"I Purchased this stationary bike no more than 6 months ago and it has already completely failed on me! A couple of weeks ago the pedal motion started to get rough, jarring but I didn't think too much of it. After that small pieces of ground plastic started falling out of the bottom of the machine and just two nights ago the pedal motion got so rough that it began hurting me knees, rendering it completely unusable.I didn't spend a fortune on this exerciser but I would have expected more than half a years use from it, if I could rate lower than one star I would!"
2,you get what you pay for!!!,Received this bike with torn box in one corner and broken black plastic housing. The torn box had nothing to do with the crack in the housing. It looks cheap.At the first opportunity will be returned for credit.
4,Really like this bike!,"The price was very good, the setup was easy and it works great! I have two problems, though. There is a ""ticking"" sound with every stroke of the pedal. The gel seat gets harder with every stroke, but I purchased a separate ""tie-on"" gel pad that helped a lot. After spending an hour on it, I find even that doesn't help my bones! Being able to watch TV while peddling is helping me keep my mind off my sore butt. My partner was hoping he could turn the resistance up higher, but it doesn't go as high as he'd like it, and the seat is too low for his long legs (it's as high as it'll go, too). It's perfect for me, though, and I recommend it for ""girls."""
2,Sucks!,"I bought this three weeks ago. After three weeks of consecutive use, the peddles stopped moving. I read one of the reviews that said it was the belt on the inside, but I bought the damned bike anyways. I am now in the process of returning this piece of trash for my money back. I definitely would not recommend this bike. I'd rather spend a lot more for something that will last. Do not buy this!"
5,BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY,A GREAT BIKE FOR THE MONEY. VERY SATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. COMPARES TO OTHERS THAT COST UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED OR MORE.
5,you'll love it!,"I ordered the fold away bike for that reason it was foldable! what a surprise it is GREAT! i would reccomed it to everyone. It arrived faster than i thought and i put it together myself in about 1/2 hour its sturdy and comfortable. i rode 4 miles the first time and it was awsome. I am so happy that I ordered this model. I was expecting a ""not to great"" bike and when i got on it i was amazed. It is truly worth the price..i recommend it to all...thank you"
1,Good while it lasts,"The bike is a solid bike but pedal blew out in 5 months of usage. I wasn't abusing the bike, just normal workouts 3 times a week and 5 months, the left pedal got loose and eventually fell off. Not worth your money, buy a better product."
4,Fitness bike,"This bike i bought for my husband for exercise. It's good enough for light exercise, it's good because it's also save space. I'm giving it 4 star cause mine was came with defective ""4-function computer tracks "" which never worked."
3,Good for a year,"Like many people, I found this bike easy to put together and a nice work-out for someone who is reasonably fit, but not an avid bicyclist.About six months into using it, it starting squealing (as mentioned by other reviewers), but didn't really have a way of opening it up, so I suffered through it. Then a couple of months later, it felt like the pedals were jerking. This steadily got worse, and I started noticing black fragments under the bike after use (again, as mentioned by others) so I got a long screw driver and opened up the plastic wheel casting. Sure enough, the underside of the belt has started wearing away, causing the pedals to slip, and making using the bike more and more difficult.I have sent an email to the company, but I'm not holding my breath for a fix, let alone a response. Although I have been pleased with my workout until now, I am disappointed that it was not made to last."
4,Quiet bike,"Pretty cheap price compared to other exercise bikes. It's extremely quiet, great for working out late at night, or in an apartment. The tension doesn't go very high, but you can get the bike peddling quite fast. I think it works well for the price."
4,Great for the money,Great for the money. Nice little bike to get your heart rate up and keep it there. It doesn't really fold away that much but the bike is small enough anyway. Strong and safe. My only problem with it is the handle bars. They don't seem like they can take a lot of weight so don't put your weight on them. It's better to sit up straight anyway.
2,Horrendous screeching sound,"I purchased one of these bikes in September. I assembled it, which was pretty easy. I thought the computer module was awfully cheap.The worst part was that whenever I increased the resistance past three or four the machine would make this hideous screeching sound, like something was misaligned and grinding against something. I promptly informed Amazon and they took it back, not cost to me."
1,implausable,After reading the other review I am left wondering if we both read the same book. This book was completely implausable. The author in no way suspended disbelief. It was neither clever or vivacious.
3,Meet Babar and his family,"Mine is a hardcover edition. The pictures are nice, but a bit small, you have to strain to see little birds in the nestsbeing fed their worms (in the Spring section). The book is basically a book about seasons, it features Babar and his family in all seasonal activities, but could as easily be Barney,Elmo, or any other character. It has no real story plot, and no drama, like the Story of Babar (my children's favorite). It's nice and educational for 2-3 year olds perhaps, but one shouldn't have to pay 10 bucks to teach about seasons."

2,PlusDeck2 PC Cassette Deck review,Installation of the PlusDeck2 was not a big deal and it does do a good job of separating the songs out one from another. You can set it up to record while you step out or if you like the music or what ever you have on the tape you can do something else. If your wanting the same quality of the mp3 as the tape this is not for you. as it is playing the cassette the sound is great but when you play back the mp3 it is pretty bad. I think they need some static removal and something to fix the speed. The mp3 sounded more like Alvan (of the chipmunks) than it did of Dolly Parton or Rodger Whittaker. In voice cassettes the voice was just a little higher and faster than it should have been but otherwise OKFor saving cassettes of speakers or talks OK but for music I don't think so.
5,A Complete Treasure,"This book has it all, from Theurgy to Occult Medicine to Magic Invocations. Occult Medicine and Practical Magic is one of lifes greatest textbooks. You will find yourself constantly referring to the information in this book, so keep it on a shelf close by. Thank you Samael Aun Weor! A special thank you is also deserved for the publishers, Thelema Press, who included such intricate details as the scientific names for plants and herbs."
5,Educational and fun,"It was fun to show it to different people, but once you run out of crowd there was not to do with it... The magnet stickers add some fun but I guess special lighting is neccesary to really enjoy them."
1,Overall not very convincing,"Whether it is home value insurance or other improvements that Shiller offers to fix the market, the one question that Shiller never deals with is why those policies don't already exist. He simply assumes that he is smarter than the market and that others have made mistakes in not offering these options. Might there be moral hazard problems in home value insurance? No discussion is offered. This approach of simply asserting an ""optimal"" arrangement without really asking why it doesn't exist if it is so ""optimal"" is something that infects a lot of economics, but you would think that if a service is so valuable the first question would be ""why doesn't the market already provide this?"" Instead Shiller's presumption that he is so smart."
1,Good for a Laugh,"What an odd book. Shiller reviews the up-sides of multiple forms of insurance without a thought to the down-sides. How much would being insured for every possible eventuality cost the user?At times, I tended to agree with the reviewer quoted on the back cover -- 'pleasantly utiopian'. At other times, I more agreed with my father, who said, after I read aloud a passage about the draconian surveilance measures needed to enforce some of the insurance contracts Shiller advocates: 'He's a very bad man.'"
5,"Extremely complex in its theory, but well worth the effort",Robert J. Shiller proposes the use of mass insurance policies to cure many of society's ills. Think he's crazy? Read the book and judge for yourself. The author makes alot more sense than you might think at first blush.
1,For advanced Guitarists Only,"I've been playing guitar for about 6 months and have a pretty good handle on several scales, so I figured I'd give this DVD a whirl. Not only is this not for beginners, it isn't something I'd consider unless you know all the notes on the fretboard. They give you the examples of the scales, and then show you what can be done within that scale, by demonstration. They play it for you, but don't give you a clue as to how you can play it. They jam away and then tell you everything they did was within that scale....but that's it. Then there's a theory section that just boggled my mind. This DVD was a major waste of money for me. All it did was make me angry. I thought I was coming along on the guitar. This just made me feel totally incompetent."
2,Not Very Helpful,"This article spends little time on the cross cultural aspects of leadership. And, while it appears lengthy at 6 pages, it is in a large font size which means it is effectively 2 pages long. Better to choose something else if you are interested in cross cultural leadership issues."
3,This was both an excellent and a disappointing book,"Excellent, because Bova has researched his target period well. The assassination plan makes sense, and the results of his POD seem both reasonable and - if you can use this term when describing an alternate history - inevitable.Disappointing, however, because after all that setup, we don't get to see what the results of this all are.The story starts on April 1st (as do the divergent events) and ends, only a month later, on April 30th just after the fall of Berlin, with Stalin dead, Khrushchev and Molotov in power in Moscow, and Roosevelt planning an atomic Pax Americana. Now, obviously this is a world that could diverge massively from our own, but the...story...just...stops!This is terribly frustrating.Still, this definitely a book worth reading and, who knows, maybe Bova will come down with a case of series-itus (why not, most other authors have...) and we'll get a sequel. I'd sure like to read that."
2,"Decently written, poorly researched.","As much as I respect Ben Bova as an author, alternate history is apparently not his strongest point. While the narrative has a nice flow, and the characters are developed well enough to appear three-dimensional, the author's research of the names of the Soviet historical figures borders on amateurish, considering the way they are spelled. The premise of the book is also not particularly believable; in the years immediately following World War II, Russian people were too thoroughly indocrinated and feeling too patriotic to undertake any type of action that would undermine the power of the nation as a whole, and in this light the assassination of Stalin, even in such covert manner, would be highly unlikely."
3,Nice main-stream alternate history novel,"What if Roosevelt had lived on, and Churchill had got rid of Stalin? This novel is mostly about what these events would have meant to the USA and to Russia in 1945 -- the novel ends with the war, so the long-term consequences are not discussed. So where good alternate history makes you wonder how our world is just a result of random events, this novel mostly lets you see what Beria, Khrushchev et al. would have done when Stalin died in the middle of the war. The book is well written, so it's nice to read. But don't expect it to change your life!"
1,flimsy,Did not like it as the product is really flimsy and tore while inserting the wires into the paper lantern.
1,Your best bet for a deal is to avoid this one!,Needs fleshing out; characters seem stilted and lifeless (and I don't mean the victims). The protagonists have been compared to Nick and Nora Charles - not likely! They do not intrigue me in the least and as for the inane ending.... Not recommended.
5,Stop an Go,"best damn plugger I ever used, wonder if it can be used to plug the holes in the national debt"
2,It's not 5 discs,"I thought this was actually 5 discs. It's not. It's only 1, plus they want you to have some bar type thing of theirs when you work out. So you have to buy that too."
3,Haven't used it yet but...,"Says it's a 5 DVD set. It's one DVD. For the price, I'm going to keep it - but very misleading!"
1,"Nice, but trite","Nice concept, but how many times must a lonely man go through a trial and find companionship in the end? Often the woman is more important than the plot and an action book becomes a romance! Surely that theme is dead, especially in modern Christian literature. The overuse of ""professional"" and ""spymaster"" render the book somewhat annoying. The characters are idealized to the extreme. The message of the book, however, is obvious: ..."
3,Good for Beginner Designer,"The book is well worthwhile for the beginning developer, someone who has a limited web library, or someone who has never done anything on the design side. On the other hand, if you have several years of experience, the book will be of less use. I personally found myself saying, ""I know that already"" a little too much for me to make the a permanent addition to my shelves.It is well written, has up-to-date graphics, and would be great for someone wanting to get their library started."
2,Not disgusting... not good,"This is less good than 'normal' store-bought jerky. Far worse than the habanero flavor, it has no kick AND the texture is that 'store bought rubber jerky texture' that i was hoping to avoid when i purchased it. There is a marginal pepper flavor but it's really not worth eating. Both jack links and oberto peppered beef jerky is better."
4,Not too bad...,"As with all anthologies, you will find some really good stuff in here and in my opinion, some fairly poor. Overall I would have to say give it a look though. How can you pass up an edition with Mr. Ed the talking horse reading Edgar Wallace books from his local library?"
2,not what I expected,The stories did not capture my attention. The title is enticing. Maybe I was expecting something else. I was disappointed.
3,"Close Her Eyes, Dorothy Simpson","This is a good buy for the low cost. The pages are yellowed, but otherwise it's very readable."
4,Despair and other feelings,"Andre Alexis' fiction collection, Despair and other stories, deals with relationships, love, and the darkness within us all. The stories are often fantastical, with a great deal of horror and humor, but they speak to real situations, fears, and life. Recurring themes are of dreams (especially nightmares), family, hands and fingers (or the absence of such), types of cloth, coincidence, sex, and death. The characters use each other (most notable in the story of a soucouyant), often acting cruelly. They then have philosophical discussions or meditations about good and evil, right and wrong, god, and the purpose of life. The stories do tend to end abruptly, with a sense of things left unfinished, unsaid, and unexplained, but this serves a purpose and leaves one feeling unsettled rather than unsatisfied."
1,Terrible!,"I would not recommend buying anything from Palm Beach Jewelry. This broach arrived without the pin on the back! (i.e., hard to pin it on the lapel of a business suit without a pin on the back!). It was also scratched! I was very unimpressed with Palm Beach Jewelry's customer service and I had to send the broach back. I still don't know if my Amazon account has been credited. What a pain!"
1,Very disappointed. The quality is very bad.,The quality of the item is really awful. I'm very disappointed with this purchase and I'm going to return it.The broach has an uneven edges and looks very cheap. Also my sample has a scratch in the middle.I'm surprised that the broach has so good reviews. Don't buy it!
2,Not to my expectation,"Although it is easy to replace these new heads, the shaving outcome was not what I expect it like the original heads did, i.e., not as sharp."
5,Norelco replacement heads,Exactly as described and fit the razor. Cost less with postage than I would have paid at Walmart.
4,Norelco HQ9 replacement heads,The product worked fine. I only needed the razor blades not the whole head but no one offered them so I ended up with more then I felt like I needed.
4,"Pricey, but beats worn out blades","Is it just me or do the replacement heads never seem to last as long as the original equipment..? Yet as soon as your shaving experience starts taking twice as long, grab a new set of heads. My only problem is that they are rather pricey, and I would change them more often if I could find them at a more reasonable price."
4,Replacing your used Norelco blades.,"Better than buying a new Norelco, buy replacement blades for your model. The technology of these are essentially the same as you get with the newer models. The cost savings are worth buying the replacements.. until something significant is developed by their R and D."
3,No great improvement with new blade heads,"After using my Norelco razor for a couple years, I replaced the blade heads thinking that I should see a noticeable improvement in the cutting quality. Sadly, I can't really tell a discernible difference between the cut of the old heads and the new ones. I can only think that this means a) old heads were holding up as well as when new and it was only my impression of the passage of time that made me think they were dulling, or b) the sharpness of the new heads was not manufactured with a quality standard that would have shown a vast improvement over 2 year old blades. Disappointing performance from Norelco, nonetheless, and at a head replacement cost that is higher than most other models."
5,Very pleased in the service recieved from Amazon Associate...,Amazon and company sending the blade were great ... Got good service and qrick delevery..Both companies work well together
3,Product works but not the quality of the original,The quality of the product is not as good as the original.The metal is much thinner. There may be two items for this number however Amazon does not describe the differences. It is working ok for now however I do not expect it to last as long which may be the reason it was a lot cheaper than those in my local stores.
4,Product is good; price is too high,These replacement heads are spendy. The Amazon price is more reasonable. The product is doing what it's supposed to do: shave my beard. So I'm satisfied with the product itself.
3,Not as fast as suggested,"I bought the razor that uses this head a couple years ago. I tend to go long on usage, not replace every six months. This unit is supposedly faster than previous designs. Some of the holes are round while others are rectangular like the older designs. I suspect the all-rectangle design actually removes more faster. But if you're looking at this as a replacement head, you're probably already stuck with the design. It's as good as the original."
3,Phillips Norelco,This blade replacement doesn't seem as sharp as the original. It might just be my imagination but it seems to leave more hair when shaving. I have to go over and over the same spot. Not too happy with this one.
5,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,Cheaper than a new razor. This head was a perfect fit and continued the ability of the best razor that I have ever had to give me a close shave.
4,Norelco shaver head replacement,The head was fine but no instructions came with it. I had some trouble getting it to stay in the shaver until I figured out how to install it.
4,Pretty good,Worked very well at first but thought it would stay sharp longer than it did. Only use it sparingly now.
2,Should be called Slow-XL,"Somehow Norelco actually made the HQ9 SpeedXL heads worse than the old lift-and-Cut heads. To make it look like the heads will produce a faster shave, they reduced the area of the outer ring to make room for two additional cutter rings inside the outer ring.The problem? The inner rings have a slower surface speed than the old, larger area, outer ring. So you actually have a smaller high speed cutter area while the inner rings end up pulling your beard hairs when you try to shave as fast as your old Lift-and-Cut shaver.Why can't you buy the old lift-and-cut heads to fit you new Smart-Touch shaver? Like all Norelco rotary rasors, each model uses a slightly different drive pin to make you buy the newer, more expensive, heads. Philips knows how to make their old products obselete so you will buy the new ""better"" stuff."
3,Norelco HQ9 -They don't last very long,"Although very good they do not last the 12 monthlife, it's more like 6 months. I think that the short life is deliberately designed into the product.At least the price at Amazon is good."
3,HQ9,I replace my Phillips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL replacement heads every year. Doing so keeps my shaver working like new. I'm unable to find the replacement heads locally. But it's a snap to order them from Amazon.com.
3,Wasn't a Big Change,"My old heads were 5 years old. Figured I needed news ones. But these seem to feel the same, maybe a little improvement."
4,A New Face!,The difference of having new blades and the previous set is like getting a new face; go for it!
2,norelco speedshaver replacement heads,"There is nothing wrong per se with the product but the replacement heads cost $30. You're much better off buying a reconditioned speedshaver razor for around $42, which will include new heads."
1,Pricing in ad versus store,"Not impressed - you show a $20.00 price in your ad - than it is over $30.00 when you go to the ""store"". Not much inclination to buy."
3,free shipping,"I thought that I had ordered an item that qualified for free shipping. I would suggest that you make such ""come on"" pitches more clearly."
3,Norelco Replacement Blades,Product is fine and works great. Not happy with the excessive wait for delivery.
1,"Din't buy if shaky hands, poor vision","I have tried replacement for Norelco shavers twice with disastrous results. I have shaky hands, moor vision, and other ols age problems which makes Norelco replacements impossible. Better to save aggravation and just buy new razor. This time a Remington.------------"
1,No thanks,advertised one price that price grabber picked up and follow the link to a higher price. Wouldn't buy at any price now
2,Only an engineer could figure out how to install the new blade set,"First, although it may not be the fault of the manufacturer of the the replacement head (Philips/Norelco), it is extremely difficult to ascertain the model number of the electric razor itself. When you think you have the model number you can order the replacement which I did. The instructions if you call them that, were useless. Now, the parts are on my desk in an envelope and I have gone back to disposable razors.Norman"
4,mr,"No problem with shipment or installation of the head, works better now with new head but not as good as when I first purchased the razor."
5,Norelco Replacement Heads,Replacing my shaver heads made a huge difference in the speed and quality of a shave. I didnt realize just how bad the old shaver heads were until I tried the new ones. They are easy to replace.
4,Works well,"Sharp, gives a nice, clean shave. No complaints since it works just as expected. Easy to clean by rinsing under a stream of water."
5,These Heads Work Perfectly,"My husband was going to buy a new razor, but I ordered these heads and they made the old razor like new again. He said it has been a long time since he had such a good shave. These are really worth the money."
5,Great Blades!,Received in 2 days. Installed this morning and they felt wonderful. I didn't realize how bad my old blades had gotten.
2,Bad head of the (3) heads,The product has (3) heads. When I started to use them (replaced them) one of the heads malfunctioned!!! Just Quit! As I needed to use the remaining (2) and i have proceded with them. It would be nice if a replacement could be sent. I don't have the bad head as it somehow was thrown away.
5,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,I put off replacing my Norelco heads for over a year because of the price. But Amazon.com offered the best price and I ordered it. The heads were delivered promptly and now I'm getting the close shave I've been waiting for. I'm glad I checked with Amazon.com.
4,"Easy to install, and it works.","Was surprised how easy these replacement blades were to install...thanks their easy-to-follow graphic directions. Had my doubts about whether replacement blades would work as well as the originals, but not any more. They do!"
5,Best Norelco Cutters Yet,These cutters are a vast improvement from the older HQ types. These lasted me over a year as opposed to the 8 months which was the best that I could get out of the older type cutters. The shaver that takes these cutters is also a surprise. It only needs to be recharged about every 3 weeks or so.
5,Norelco HQ9 Heads,These replacements heads cost less through Amazon then even those on Ebay. Could not find a better deal then this one.
5,Works just like new.,I used to just buy a new razor when it no longer cut well because years ago I bought replacement blades and they were no better than old blades. These new blades are just like when razor was new. Happy shaver!
4,Works as it should,"The Norelco blades came quickly. They fit my razor. Did I get a much better shave. Not sure as my orginal blades were not complety worn out. I do not get as close of shave with a razor versu an electric razor, but it is good enough on most days.But if you like electric shavers, these replacement blades were just as they promised. And I am now using my eletric shaver almost ever day. It's convenient and fast. But most men probably already knew this information anyway."
5,Norelco Shaving Heads,"The original heads lasted a little more than a year. Now that I have the replacement heads, it's like a whole new razor!"
5,HQ9 SpeedXL Heads,I have a very soft beard and face. I still haven't had to replace the original heads on my razor. And I get an incredible shave.
1,Not what's pictured on the box.,"First off, I have to say I haven't used the product yet. This is just a review of what I ordered vs. what I received.The original shaving heads had three circles of blades, 12 around the outside and 9 more arranged on the inner two circles. A picture of the original heads are on the box of replacements and look exactly what I took out of my razor. This HQ9 is also what is listed as the correct replacement #.But what you get is different - a shaving head with ONE outer circle (no others) and only NINE blades. It still says 'Triple Track Heads' on the box, which doesn't make sense to me.I've been totally ripped off."
2,No instructions how to install,No instructions how to install I had to go to norelco web site this is the fault of norelco for not putting instructionsin with the replacements.
2,Replacement heads appear not to be new,"I replaced the old the heads (about 4 years old) with the new package. To my surprize, no difference in shaving. I believe the heads i received were not new,"
5,Great Replacement Heads,"Received fast, no instructions included but got from the web.Installed in a click and ready to shave.I did feel the difference and reduced the time to shave.Good investment."
5,Replacement heads,"Although this what not the first time I have replaced the heads, this was the easiest time I have had purchasing the heads. The description was enough for me to get the right heads on the first try and the shipping was done in a timely fashion."
4,Replace every 2 years.,"My Norelco shaver was taking noticeably longer and far more passovers to complete my shave.I knew that it had been 2 years since I switched blades and it was a time for a new one.When I switched my blades to this replacement head, my shave was noticeably faster and took far fewer passovers.In my opinion, Norelco makes the best shavers in the market right now. Although their blades do an adequate job, their shavers are not quite as clean as the Gillette or Schick blades. Nevertheless, one cannot beat convenience of electric shavers and the quality of the Norelco shave is very close to the blade shave.Norelco recommends the users to replace the head once every year. That would be true if you have a lot of beard. If you are a moderate beard grower, then replacing it every 1.5 to 2 years should suffice. Either way, you will see a significant improvement in your shave after replacing your Norelco shaving head."
5,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,"My old XL razor was cutting pretty slow and rough. So I ordered the HO9 Replacement Head Set. It took a few minutes to remove the old cutting heads and replace them with the new HO9 set. Viola', it's shaving like it did when it was new."
3,Norelco HQ9 Seped Replacement Heads,Just not smart enough to replace them in my razor by the dierections on box. Too old at 75 I guess. They fit back in and run but do not shave.
2,Shaving ability and closness,I was disappointed in the ability to give a close shave. I decided that the two year old razor blades I was using neded replacement but to be honest I'm not sure I am experiencing a difference with the new ones
3,Genuine replacement blades?,Received the replacement heads for my Norelco razor. There was nothing on the packaging to indicate they were genuine Norelco blades. They seemed no sharper than the used head they replaced.
4,Genuine Norelco - accept no substitutes,When you buy original equipment replacement parts at a fair price - you get the proper performance. The Norelco original cutters give the long and accurate performance that you expect. Accept no substitute. There are no effective aftermarket cutters. Just buy originals and buy them right. Keep a spare set around because prices don't go down and genuine Norelco stainless cutters are worth the difference and give you your moneysworth.
1,"Waste of Money, Won't Buy Again","I was initially impressed by this line of razors and its blades, but no more. Having owned and used one of these razors for 1 and 3/4 years I won't be buying another one. The blades work great the first month. Ok the second and third month. But then quickly go down hill. Won't shave my beard worth beans anymore. I found myself returning more and more to my Gillette Fusion razor with increasing frequency each day; first to ""touch up"" what the Norelco missed, then inevitably for full shaving creme and razor shaves. If you want to keep using the Norelco it means you have to buy replacement blades far more often then you should; making the total cost of ownership excessively unreasonable."
1,Sent me wrong model,"Ordered HQ9 heads, received HQ56 heads. The bar code sticker shows HQ9, wrong box. Too late to return. Will never purchase online again."
2,Philipa Norelco HQ10 Speed XL replacement head,I recieved the new head and have found it does not give a close shave - not even as close as the 2 year old head it was replaced with.
3,blades,razor is just OK - blades seem to wear out quickly. Service from amazon is great. Would not buy this razor again
3,"blades sharp, makes a difference","No problem with the cutter and screen, but be aware: the replacement heads are just that: the blades and screens.It does NOT include the entire top portion of the shaver that holds the cutters and screens, which is what broke on mine and the reason I bought the heads in the first place. This might be due to my ignorance of the world of shavers, but it went past me. In hindsight, given the cost, I would buy a new shaver rather than fiddle with an old one. Delivery from Amazon was speedy, as always."
2,Norelco HQ replacement head,"There was an improvement in the performance of the cutting head, but I am very disappointed that it is going to cost me 1/3 the value of the entire shaver to replace the head when needed. I will probably stop using the Norelco after this head wears out."
3,it's a replacement,i do not know why i put off replacing my blades for my razor so long LOL ... ... ...
2,New Heads NOT Needed,"The new heads I bought were billed as making a big difference in my shaving experience. After installation, I could detect no difference so the expense was not worth it."
5,Nice Product,"I bought this because I could not find it in the store. Now they are everywhere. But, I got a better price and had in just a few days."
3,Got this for a 2 year old shaver; didn't make as much difference as I anticipated,"My Norelco shaver is at least two years, and I have never changed the heads. I thought this would dramatically change the shaving speed/how it felt, but it really didn't. It's also way more expensive than it seems like it should be."
4,Speed XL Replacement Heads,"I used these to replace the heads which were several years old on my Norelco Speed shaver... Normally, I would just replace the entire razor in order to get fresh batteries and a new motor; however it's becoming difficult to find reasonalbly priced Speed-XL shavers. I was surprised that after several years of everyday use there wasn't a great deal of difference with new heads. That said, Amazon had by far the best price for these heads beating even WalMart by $10!"
3,Have had problems installing them,Good price but I have had problems installing them. They are the correct heads for my razor but I still have had problems.
4,Norelco HQ9,cutter blades made my Norelco the same as new.Amazon price was better than anyplace I know.will replace these blades when they dull.
4,Replacement Blades,"Easy to install, I just need to remember to change them out more than once a year"
3,Norelco shaver heads,I understand from all the hype that I must have needed a new set of heads for my shaver but frankly I have not seen an improvement worth talking about.I really believe the shave I am getting is only marginly better.
5,Norelco Razor,My husband was very very pleased with the replacement blades he received.We were pleased with the time of delivery.
4,Big Improvement!!!,Replaced with these blades after a year of daily use. Should have done this a lot sooner. Hope these wear as well as the originals. We'll see.
4,Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,"Before ordering, you need to know the model of your razor as Philips Norelco makes several different replacement blades. Pay attention to the positioning of the blades as you remove them from the razor, as replacement is not difficult, but the blades will only go into the razor head one way. If you only replace your blades once a year, you will definitely notice a difference on the first use after blade replacement."
4,Good Buy,I get a new set of heads every 12-18 months. Never had any problems and they worked as designed.
4,Replacement heads for Norelco Razor,This product is exactly as advertised and was less expensive than the equivalent product I was bidding on at ebay.
5,Norelco replacement heads,"The improvement in my razor with the new heads was significant and I will never again use old heads for an extended period. I'm happy with what I received, and the price was OK - I could buy them at Wal-Mart for close to the same price, and would not have to pay for shipping and handling."
5,Norelco rotary replacement blades,The Norelco razor is excellent and the replacement blades which I replace once a year are excellent.
2,Eh,I'm not a big fan of manic panic. It washes out very quickly and doesnt really give you the colour you want
1,Pastel? Not quite...,"I like coloured hair, but for me, it has to be a lighter, more subtle look for it to be right. I was looking for a light pretty purple that would be a nice lilac shade, just off blonde but still noticeable. Before I started, my hair was a light blonde with some old pink highlights (very light). I applied the Lie Locks dye all over my head, let it sit for ~40 minutes, and washed it out to find a very deep, almost blue, purple. I was absolutely horrified. I spent the next half an hour trying to fade it a bit with dish soap, laundry detergent, and numerous shampoos with little success.All I can say is I have NO idea how it turned out this colour, and I am very dissatisfied. Basically, be careful."
3,Not pastel at all,I bought this in hopes of having lilac hair. I've done two applications (used up an entire jar and a half of another) and both times my hair has turned a rather dark purple than a pastel. I would like to think that the 105 degree weather we were having and the fact it sat in a metal mail box for a couple of hours is the reason why the color is so wrong. I might try to add some conditioner to the rest and see how it goes. But other than the color being completely incorrect it lasts very well on my hair.
1,Died after a year and half,"I have a slightly older version of this PS with one thermally controlled fan - but very little has changed in their design since then.If you buy this PS, save your receipt. w/o this - the warranty is no good. And you will most likely need it within 3 years - here is why.The power supply feels heavy and is well constructed. But there appear to be design issues that will make this fail after a year or two. Some components that apparently run quite hot are placed right next (almost attached) to electrolytic capacitors that don't take kindly to heat. With time (less than 2 years in my case) the electrolytic capacitors fail resulting in catastrophic failure - burnt parts inside.Warning - A thermally impaired person may be involved the design of this power-supply.Also note that Antec does not advertise the efficiency level of this PS - simply claims that this is 25% more efficient without divulging any numbers."
4,Attention: Planchette Pushers,A great book to have in your collection. This is more than A.C. and the Ouija. This small book packs a big punch as it gives out an overview of Spirit communication in Western occultism. It has lots of delicious tidbits about the Ouija board and leaves a trail of landmarks to where more info is stashed in the occult community.
5,The fascinating true history of the ouija board,"Aleister Crowley and the Ouija Board presents the fascinating true history of the ouija board, a device purported to facilitate communication with spirits, back to John Dee, Queen Elizabeth's advisor, who allegedly used it to contact angels and codify the Enochian Alphabet. Of especial interest is the true story of twentieth-century magician Aleister Crowley, who made effective use of the ouija board and even attempted to create and sell a version of the device. An absorbing examination of the history, current usage, and future of a mysterious and mystical device, cherished by some as a magical tool, and condemned by others as a gateway to the devil, and dismissed by skeptics as a hoax."
2,"Ouija,Ouija are you There?","One might be led as I was to Believe that this book is a commentary actually written by Uncle Al, it's not. I found this book dry and boring compared to works actually written by The Great Therion. Don't Bother, Skip this Selection.-dop"
4,"Great product, one small inconvenience","It's great Norelco shaver, very satisfied, i like it more than Brown.The only minor inconvenience is that you can not shave while it changes."
3,Norelco shaver,"This particular Norelco is only fair compared to an another one I have; However, I realize that my other Norelco is a more expensive model."
3,Visually Imaginative,"This is your basic fun sci-fi book about alien invaders on Earth with an archeological twist. In order to explore an idea of a mysterious and omnipresent extra-terrestrial presence, Fosters uses an Indianna Jones aproach in the beginning to set the stage for the main character to access an alternative and invisible, ""that explains it"", reality. This strange unseen world is the best part of the book. The concept is quite unique and makes for a mildly psychadelic read."
3,Not much science in it,"This is more like an advanture story with fantasy background, the main character is an observer in the story and didn't do much to resolve the plot, the old aristocrat from German took him for a wild ride around the world and helped him on every steps.The idea that human misery comes from interference of inter-dimensional creatures is an interesting one, but that's about it."
2,Dog book with a shar pei title,"I really agree with one of the previous reviews. This book has very little information that is specific to the shar pei breed. It contains info about the history of the shar pei and the characteristics of the breed, but that is all stuff that you can find for free just from shar pei sites. The other information is general to practically all dogs, such as housebreaking, dental care, and finding a lost dog. I would not reccommend this book if you are really looking for information specific to the shar pei."
4,only if you like rick wakeman,a flowing 70s concept progressive rock lp. its good but not great. my opinion only.
2,disappointing discovery,I purchased Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee as a gift and it was quite expensive; I have only just found out that it had a funny taste!
1,Completely lacking in aroma and taste.,"This coffee was lacking in aroma and taste. I don't know if the beans were really old, but this was not the jbm coffee we have had in the past."
3,Just ok,Just average coffee. For the price it's not worth it. It's hard to find the minimum 29 words to say anything about this coffee.
3,Not worth it for the money,"First a little background on me. I Am a coffee drinking fiend. I probably keep several countries coffee production up, so I know coffee. I don't mind strong coffee or so so tasting coffee I just dont expect it to be expensive so so tasting coffee. I have had and love Jamaican Blue mountain coffee before but it was a lot more expensive than this. This came in a cute little burlap sack (you get some style points there) but after that it's pretty much down hill. The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price. I have ordered some more Blue mountain from another supplier will have to see how that goes. This is one that will not get any repeat business from me. There are plenty of other better tasting coffees out there at a lower price."
1,Do not buy this merchant dishonest.,"I was one of the buyers from China, I believe amazon, long-term international transshipment logistics company in the amazon shopping, merchandise presentation Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee, Certified 100% Pure, Roasted Beans by Wallenford Estate Coffee Company.Is the CIB certified coffee dealer.I received the goods Wallenford Blue.Wallenford Blue is a the CIB certified dealers, but the product has not been CIB certification.This is cheating, I did not expect such fraudulent businesses in the United States in the amazon.Strongly urge the the amazon punishment such dishonest merchants."
5,Writhers' Review,The Canon 200DG Digital Camera Gadget Bag is ideal and stores my 5D Camera and accessories in one place for easy access.
4,If you carry lots of camera gear this is your bag,This bag is big. If you carry a body and more than one extra lens; this is the bag for you. I think I will be in the market for something for just the camera and lens I use most often for everyday use. Good quality; excellent value.
4,very nice camera bag,I am satisfied with this camera bag at this price. even I prefer to remove the metalic part.
2,Clip gone bad,"I had this bag for a little over a year - was great until I used it in the winter - the plastic clips that keep the top closed become drittle in the cold. One snapped, and I can no longer keep the top latched.I called Canon parts and they don't sell parts for the bag - so this bag will end up in the trash.I have a Lowepro backpack also and love it. I'll have to buy one of their smaller bags to replace this one."
3,Buying camera bags,"Having ordered a camera bag, and bought one in a store, I think it is better to go to a good camera store. There is no substitute, at least at my current level of experience, for handling the bags, seeing how they open, and what they hold in person. That may change with experience, but for now, I'll drive to the camera store for bags."
5,Great Bag,I bought this for my dad and he loved it - big enough to fit everything you want and he says it does protect the camera from any damage.
3,If you are going to buy alot of glass...this bag not be for you.,"I just recently bought this bag and the construction of the bag is so far very good. The only problem I have with this bag is what it is able to hold. My bag is currently holding the canon 7d body with the kit lens on it the 28-135mm attatched to it. I also have the 70-200mm lens in its protective bag. otherwise the rest of the room is taking up by a 430exii flash with lens hoods around it. That is it with space. The accessory pockets are decent for holding small things like extra batteries, memory etc. So if you are planning to buy alot of glass for your camera body this isnt the bag to store it in cause there would be no room. But this is a good bag if you know what you are going to shoot for the day and pack the couple lens in it that you would be using. I would say the quality, construction, and the price are pretty good."
5,Excellent Gadget Bag,"I am very happy with my Canon Gadget Bag. I have three lenses, flash, 3 compact flash cards, Rebel XTi, battery grip, and much more all inside this bag! It's extremely spacious and comfortable to carry, plus it makes you look like a pro. It's also very attractive with it's metallic silver accents... very nice. The price is perfect, and you won't find it cheaper elsewhere. I highly recommend this gadget bag.. don't think about it anymore, just go for it.. you'll love it too, promise! :P"
4,PDVs review,"Great bag! Holds my Canon A650IS + Telephoto & Wide angle lens, filters, mini tripod & extras. Exactly what I needed. Lightweight & very high quality."
3,Camera Case,I'm sure almost everyone will like this Camera Case. For me it is too clumsy on the outside. The shoulder strap is too large and bulky. It should be depicted in more detail
5,OMG Amazing,The canon bag was amazing. It has tons of compartments for all the attachments. The shipment and quality was great. I would recommend the seller and the product to all canon users.
3,A case with an identity crisis,"This bag is good quality, but the size is deceiving. It really is too large to be an over the shoulder sling bag. It will flop around awkwardly. The strap is misshapen to fit on your shoulder more easily, but it just makes it less convenient to quickly throw on your shoulder because there is only one correct orientation. The top clasp buckle is metal, but the bottom is tough plastic that's a pain to open. Eventually, it will break as many reviewers have stated. I suggest looking for a smaller bag because a bag this size would do better on your back. The velcro on the lid gives you a false sense of security that it will hold if the buckles aren't clasped, but it definitely won't. I'd recommend the 2400 over this one. This one is just way too large and bulky to be a sling."
4,"Pricey, but nice.","I bought mine at Best Buy for $70.I've got my 550d with the 18-55 kit lens, a 50mm 1.8 FD w/ converter, a Fisheye, a shotgun microphone, a flash bracket, a handle, and all of my cables and memory cards with room to spare.It holds the tripod pretty nicely. If I ever fly with my camera, I'm taking this bag.The bag's strap is actually a bit too long, I prefer messenger style bags to be midway up my back, since I ride a bicycle frequently. This makes the bag less likely to slide around on my back, and less likely to be shaken from bumps. With the strap fully retracted, it reaches my waist, and I'm about 5'9""."
3,Deceptive online picture,"When I first looked at the picture, I thought it was a leather one. However, it's completely built with Nylon. It is good looking while not as sleek as the webpage shows. The design is smart and useful. It's also spaceous for my Fuji S9000 + Pana GS300. If you do not care the price, it deserves a 4 star, however consider the price, I can only rank it * 3.5."
4,fits 60D,"I returned the smaller 200 bag as my 60 D was to big and was hoping this was enough bigger to make a difference, IT WAS. I fit my 60D w Battery grip and 17-35 2.8 on it, + my 18-200, + my 100-400 L, 430 speed light + misc. chargers, books, filters, & batteries.Mo way I could make the 70-200 l 2.8 fit, so I can the carry strap thru the lens case belt strap and I can carry them all (bit heavy tho). Seems to be well built and I did not notice excessive stress on the joints."
5,BUY ONE you won't regret it,I use this just as a lens bag and love it. I don't even have a canon camera any more it's a perfect lens bag.
4,Perfect size for my dslr!,"I absolutely loved this bag! It was able to very easily fit my dslr plus three lens, additional batteries, lens cleaner, etc. While it comfortably fit everything I needed and more, it was not too big and felt comfortable over my shoulder. I definitely recommend this bag. =)"
4,Very nice bag,Nice bag. The bag was a little bigger than I thought but it will handle all my equipment with a little room to spare. The only fault might be the plastic buckles which I felt were a little cheap.
3,Not user friendly buckles,"Great bag, the right size for everything I need. The buckles can be a pain when your in a hurry."
4,Compartmentalized and durable,"If you're purchasing a Canon EOS Rebel T3, this bag seems to be the perfect partner; other bags reviewed on this website have complained of insufficient room or weak construction; not to worry here; this bag has loads of room for said camera and is quite sturdy in its design. Hope this helps."
5,Canon perfect bag,If you have a rebel or one of the other digital semi to pro cameras this bag is perfect. Just the right size. I am very pleased with it.
4,Camera bag,The qaulity if nice. But it's nice comfortable enough to walk around in central park with. Get yourself a backpack if you does a lot of walking.
3,The buckle dinged my camera!,"The buckles on this camera are sturdy but are heavy and over the top. In fact, when I closed this bag, the metal latch dinged the magnesium alloy on my camera body and chipped away some paint."
5,Great Bag,"Lots of side compartments, in addition to the already big main compartments. Fits about, 2 SLR bodies, 4 lenses, as well as other accessories (batteries, lens filters, etc). It also comes with a shoulder strap for the bag, or the tripod (IF you have one).Was definitely worth the purchase, I'm glad I purchased this one instead of the other, smaller Canon bag."
2,Quick connect couplers don't hold up,"Bought this bag 8 months ago to hold my dslr, lenses, flash, etc. The size and layout worked quite well for me, and for the first 6 months I had no issues with the construction of it. However, over the last two months the plastic to metal couplers on the straps that hold the lid shut have failed. The plastic half of these fasteners have worn to the point that the couplers will not stay coupled. You can still carry it by the shoulder strap, just don't forget and grab the top handle because the top will open and dump your equipment. Called Canon and they told me that there is no warranty on their bags, so I will be replacing this one."
5,Very good looking bag,order from Amazon. Very good looking bag and quality. but I am a professional photogragher and I don't have a lot of lens or other stuff go with camera then it is big for me. I like this bag for the look and quality built .recommend it if you have more than 2 cameras and lenses...
5,"Great deal, great bag","This bag holds everything for me! The construction of it is excellent and I like the small pockets on the sides. They are deceivingly deep and can hold quite a bit. Overall, I would definitely recommend this bag to others!"
5,Great Durable Bag,Nice bag very big and spacious. Actually bigger than I thought but worth the price and has lots of room for all your accessories.
4,Very nice bag,"You can't beat the price and there is enough room to store everything I need when I fly. I can store the lens, flash, charger, batteries and even some of my other devices and plenty of room for a sandwich."
2,Shoddy Workmanship,"Although well designed and thoughfully put together, the stitchingof a closure strap failed after a week of use. I had to pay a shoe repairman to correct the problem."
4,Couples Who KILL,"I wanted to know more about what makespeople like these, torture and killothers...I wasn't very surprised at whatI read, but in some cases extremely sickto my stomach, to know there are such peopleare out there..and will continue to do so.."
2,Not in good condition.,"Part of a page is missing. Jacket is in OK condition, the rest of the book has seen too many years in the public hands."
4,Super Reader,"This is also called The Last Planet.Central Control is failing, and with it, the Space Patrol. They are running out of planets, resources, money, and everything else.Star Rangers tells the story of a beaten up old ship, on a final mission. They end up on a planet controlled by your basic supervillain bent on world domination, with the nasty twist that he is a supremely powerful telepath.While a good old space adventure of this sort, it is a little deeper than that, with issues of prejudice, xenophobia, etc. being important throughout."
5,Kid Loves it,"Our daughter loves this zebra. This is a different kind of stuffed animal. Not cheap and definitely has a better ""snuggle factor"" than most stuffed animals.Doesn't shed little bits and pieces and washes well. Don't put it in the dryer though. The ""mane"" will not last through a dryer. The mane looks more like a mohawk after a trip through the dryer.Our daughter is an animal lover, so maybe that helps you decide."
4,Weird!,"This is one of the most weird CD's I've heard in a long time! Some of the tracks are so special that they easily could deserve the 5th star in my rating, but the totally indifferent intro and outro tracks prevent that. But the core tracks themselves are amazing! Just listen to ""Hunting for black september"" and tell me if that isn't fantastic?!? The mixture of clean vocals/acoustic guitars and warped industrial/neo-classic undertones works perfectly together to create a highly personal amalgam of strangeness. And the lyrics are awesome as well... If you want something to challenge your ears musically, then give ""Make love, and war"" a listen!! Great innovative stuff!!"
4,"Review excerpt from ""Women's Concerns"", Spring 1999, p. 31.","Ann A. Estill writes:This scholarly feminist anthology offers essays on several topics where feminist thinking casts new light on old thinking and writing...As with any anthology, readers are drawn to some topics more than others, but all will be rewarded with well-researched material to aid them in the never-ending task of seeking to be informed feminists."
1,Don't waste your money.,I have purchased many different kinds of fruit leather in the past and this one is the worst. It is very dry and tasteless. It lacks color and has a foam like texture. I would suggest going to target and buying the fruit leather they have in stock.
4,A page turner from beginning to end.,I was caught up from the beginning of this book. I thought I had figured out the killer but was surprised that I was wrong. I am glad to have finished this book so I can go on with my life. It kept me occupied for hours.
2,SLOW with too many confusing characters!,I have read better MHC books than this! The book left me flipping back and forth trying to remember who each character was. You Belong to Me was incredibly slow and predictable.
1,excelent,"first is was written by Mary Higgins Clark. One of the best authors out there.Second it is a great who done it.A woman who has a radio show is asking about a woman who went on a cruse & never came back. It turns out that there are quite a few women are doing this.Then we learn about different men in the picture.Also other women are calling in to the radio show saying that they were on a cruse & were approached by a man on board. Then they are being killed. He gives them a ring that saids on the inside ""You Belong To Me. Then a man that sold the rings is murdered.So who is the killer. The last person you will think it is."
2,Ridiculous,"I listed to this on tape and I was very disappointed. Susan Chandler is supposedly a very intelligent woman, yet the audience figures out who the killer is WAY before she does. And she's an educated talk show host? I think Dr. Laura would have this gal for lunch. The turquoise ring thread was a lot of overkill too. What interested me at first was the luxury cruise ship connection, but even that got old after awhile."
2,Not good. Not good at all.,"I am so disappointed to be writing this review! MHC is one of the only mystery authors I will give any sort of attention to and typically when I pick up one of her books I'll have it read in 3 days max. Up to this point, her success rate in the world of me has been 100%. Without really having to say anything else, I'll tell you that this book took me 3 weeks, 3 WEEKS, to read.She definitely has a formula with her books: Grim Incident at the Beginning + Interesting Explanatory Story in the Middle = Super Suspenseful and Thrilling Ending.Although the formula can make for simple reading, it always makes for a great mystery. However, with this book, the formula went more along the lines of:Quick and Bland Explanatory Story at the Beginning + Very Bland, Predictable and Mildly Grim Incidents throughout the Middle= Anticlimactic Ending. The book read like a bad murder drama you'd see on Lifetime Television for Women.So so so disappointing!"
1,You Belong To Me,"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I truly enjoy reading mystery/thrillers, but found the author's need to hold my hand throughout the story annoying. The main charaters internal dialogues were patronizing at best. None of the characters were even remotely believable. Every character was so candy coated. The only reason I read the whole book was from a lack of better options. I realize now that my time would have been better spent reading the telephone book."
3,You Belong To Me,"You Belong To Me traces the mystery surrounding the deaths of several lonely young women. Dr. Susan Chandler, radio talk show host, finds herself in the middle of the story after she invites a guest on her show to talk about his book.The underlying plot to this book seems a little strange. Although it is not obvious who the killer is until the end of the book, it is also not obvious why they killed in the first place!"
2,Another Airplane Book,"This book is suitable for mindless wasting of time and/or airplanes but little more. The bad news is that the story and characters are immediately forgetable. The good news is that you can read it again with only a vague, lingering sense of deja vu. I don't think Ms. Clark need worry about that Pulitzer, but then, with a fat bank account from turning out bestsellers, she probably isn't worried about leaving a substantial literary legacy. And she shouldn't be. This is the stuff that builds publishing houses. Kind of like drywall - dependable, cheap, looks good, but not a whole lot of depth or real substance."
1,Predictable!!,I had read all of her book and feel that she has lost much of her flair in her writing recently. The characters lack depth and the story line is boring..I feel like she just simply create a simple plot and go with it through the end . And I could even guess who the villain is from the start just from knowing that he must be the one who is less suspected and recived less mentioning in the story...
1,cardboard characters and a mystery that's easy to figure out,"I must admit I was not expecting much from Mary Higgins Clark after her last couple of attempts, and I was not disappointed. This is definitely the worst one I have read by her, however. I agree with some of the other reviewers who say that the identity of the murderer was obvious. There is no character development in this novel. What I found to be the worst part about this book was how perfect most of the people were: Susan is beautiful, charming, intelligent, well-dressed, has perfect hair, etc. etc. Plus most everybody was filthy rich. Am I seeing a pattern here? Not worth the time I took to read it."
4,Very Good Read,"You belong to me was a twisting and interesting tell that I throughly enjoyed. From the begining where Dr.Susan Chandler discovers that the murders somehow must go together to the end where the mysterious killer is revealed. Yes this plot is not as complicated as other books, it was a little slow in the begining, but quickly intertwined you in a story of suspense. The killer at the end totally through me off I thought it was definately not that person and someone else who would be more suting to that role. I recommened this novel to anyone wanting a good read that is quite interesting yet suspenseful. This will keep you reading for a while, I read it in a matter of days! I couldn't put it down. For those who have already read You Belong to Me I recommend another of Mary Higgins Clark's books I'll be Seeing you is absolutely fabulous!"
3,"It was okay, but..","I was a little disappointed. I had hoped to find a thrilling suspense and, at times, I did. However, it was intertwined with useless details (for example, the main character is a psychologist, and the book goes into details about her unrelated clients' problems several times) where I just felt like they either needed to fill pages or simply wanted more suspense by adding these asides between clues. I didn't want to stop reading because I was adamant to find out who it was, but I was bored at times. It felt to me like adding suspense in a movie by pausing and showing a few holes of golf before returning to its plot. I liked the plot overall and felt the book had a good way of keeping you guessing, but by the middle of it all I was doing was keeping a mental countdown of how long it would be until I could finally finish it."
3,Good Suspense!,"This is the second book that I have read by Mary Higgins Clark. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and it kept me guessing until the very end. Dr. Susan Chandler has a radio show where she interviews an author about his book called Vanishing Women. Little does she realize, but this interview sparks a chain of events that lead to several murders and puts her own life in danger. It was a good suspensful read. My only complaint about this book is that I disliked the strange motive behind the killer's actions. I didn't really get a clear sense of what was driving him to such horrific acts of murder, and the explanation just didn't seem to satisfy me enough to really believe it. Otherwise, I enjoyed the quick pacing of the story."
4,Still the best who-dunnit author,"A warning to all readers! Don't pick up one of her books if you have an early morning wake-up; you find that ""only one more chapter"" stretches way into your sleep hours. This time, Dr. Laura, er, Dr. Susan kept getting her listeners killed, and she even loses some blood, but.... Sure, a lot of it is predictable, but it's still entertaining, it's NOT X-rated, and the white hats win in the end. I wonder how she comes up with all these plots? Hope she has another book on the way. Keep it up, Ms. Clark. (Momma Clark, that is!)"
4,I highly recommend this book.,"I love the character of Dr. Susan Chandler!! I couldn't put this book down. I just had to keep reading, and the ending is perfect!"
2,Not as good as other MHC books,"This book wasn't bad but not terribly exciting. I've just started reading MHC books, and I was a little disappointed with this one. I wasn't particularly crazy about any of these characters, and the story was rather boring at times. One good thing I will say about it is I did not know who the killer was until the end."
2,A complete dissapointment,"I thought that ""You Belong To Me"" was absolutely void of suspense. The characters were totally one-dimensional and the ending was completely anti-climactic. I only recently started reading her books. I started with ""The Cradle Will Fall"" and absolutely loved it! But this latest attempt is not up to par with her earlier books. I will think twice before buying her next book."
1,Simply awful....as were her last three books.,"Is it my imagination or is Ms. Clark starting to write at the third grade level? I thought The Lottery was truly silly. Then I bought this one. I will NEVER spend another $22.00 (less Amazon discount, of course) for another MHC dreck."
2,Why did I read this book?,I have read many of MHC books and I have found her latest a dissapointment. The characters completely fit the mold of her other novels and the plot is predictable. MHC is sticking to her plot formula a bit too closely and has forgotten to make it interesting. In her other novels she leaves you guessing until the last minute. Not this one! If you've never read a MHC then I suggest that you don't start with this one.
2,A mixture of bland writing and implausible characters,"Mary Higgens Clark's popularity remains quite high but her recent books do not measure up to earlier offerings which offered intricate, suspenseful plots and characters and settings which were richly described and quite believable. In her latest book, You Belong to Me, the main character is in danger from a psychopath and the reader is forced to guess which one of the seemingly normal men in the story is the villain. The heroine, however, is not developed enough for us to care who is after her; in addition, the three suspects are merely paperdoll characters and one gets the impression that the author simply said ""eeney, meeney, miney, mo"" and picked the bad guy before she wrote the final chapter. No matter what the hype, skip this one."
2,"""Oh, Win!"" Oh, Please!","I haven't read a book of Mary Higgin's Clark for awhile, and now I remember why I haven't. It seems that every female character from book to book is the same. This book is merely a cardboard cut out from another book. It was simple to see who was the killer. The only reason I kept on reading was to see what the killer's motivation would be. Some of the characters seemed so dim. ""Oh, Win!"" Oh, Please!"
3,Typical Mary Higgins Clark...,"I must admit I was disappointed. I've read all of Mary's books, and the last few have been let downs for me. I simply hate it when I figure out the book long before it ends. But, I hate it more when I figure out the author. And, Mary is easy to see through now, I'm sad to say. This book follows along the lines of all of Mary's works. She points towards numerous people as being the villan. However, it's easy to note that she shies away from making one individual as ""evil"" as the rest. Guess what? There's your guilty butler! However, regardless of the easy mystery, it was a simple read that filled the hours on a plane ride. And, for that, I will recommend it."
3,Pretty good.,"This was an entertaining read -- I finished it on a plane in one sitting. How do you turn a dumb song lyric into an interesting plot line, cast suspicion on practically every male character, and save the heroine in the end? Read this book."
3,"Underestimated this work, didn't think it could be this bad","I have read all of Mary CH's books and I was very excited to read her latest when I started, but when I finished, I was extremely dissapointed. She's written a lot better. This novel was read like a $2.00 cheap book. It wasn't worth the money. I suggest that Mary HC takes a lot more time on her next novel. The three stars I gave it,were for effort and plot."
3,"""You Belong To Me"" is not one of Clark's best efforts.","""You Belong to Me"" is not vintage Mary Higgins Clark. It lacks the suspense and well-developed characters to make it the page turner and one-night read she is famous for. The villian is easily spotted, and the plot is drawn out so that the last 100 pages are far from exciting."
4,I really enjoyed this book,"I had a little trouble getting into it at the beginning, but I am glad I followed through. It turned out to be a very suspensful, interesting story. As the story progressed, I found myself going back and forth as to who the murderer was, right up until the very end. I ultimately guessed wrong, but I am not much of a detective anyway!As I said, it was enjoyable and I am glad I took the time to get through the somewhat boring beginning."
4,MHC's content for You Belong to Me is an 'eye opener',"It appears that MHC intended this novel to be autobiographical for the character Dr. Susan Chandler. By not disclosing too much information about the actual killer to the readers, MHC mimics how well Susan knows his background. The readers are made privy to about as much information as Susan learns throughout the course of the novel. I think MHC sends a implicit warning to people in vulnerable situations to be more aware and trust your instincts. This is the first MHC book I've read, and I plan to read more of her writing."
4,"Another ""can't-put-it-down"" book!","I love MHC books! I know they will keep me in suspense and away from my computer and housework! This one didn't disappoint me either! Besides humming the oldie tune in my mind throughout the book, I loved the Dr. Susan Chandler character and hope Mary brings her back again. RadioTalk shows are so popular and it was fun to get to know one in a fast-paced book like YOU BELONG To ME! The only disappointment was the ending, which was hurriedly finished in a page or two as if to make a deadline...it was over so fast! I guess I didn't want the book to end. But all in all, it was another successful book!!! I loved it!"
3,Good Book That's a Quick Read,This was my first Mary Clark Higgins book and I enjoyed it very much. It was a very easy book to read. The plot pulled me in after the first few pages. I'd recommend it to a friend.
1,"No real suspense, no real character development","Parts of the book were enjoyable, but all in all it left me feeling like I wish I had spent my time reading something else. Does she really write these books anymore or is it a ghost writer churning out novels under her name because she is so marketable? Quite a disappointment, but par for the course with her latest novels."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could,"If you've read anything she's written recently, you'll recognize the killer the minute he enters the scene. If you loved All Around the Town and Loves Music Loves to Dance like I did, pass on this one and reread the classics. (I highly reccomend The Anastasia Syndrome for a change of pace)"
1,Haven't I read this somewhere before?,"Ah, yes. The same plot existed in ""Loves Music, Loves to Dance"" (which WAS an excellent novel). The heroine's Mr. Right, the last person you'd suspect, is actually an insane murderer. I had the killer in ""You Belong to Me"" pegged from the start just on a hunch. The fact that MHC didn't explore his personal life in the story confirmed it. I found this story rather disappointing compared to MHC's previous novels. I thought ""Loves Music, Loves to Dance"" was quite riveting and suspenseful, which is what I enjoy most about MHC's style, but the most that can be said about ""You Belong to Me"" in comparison to other MHC books is that it is nothing more than PREDICTABLE."
1,One of Higgins' Worst,"In previous books, such as Where Are the Children,The Cradle Will Fall, and Stillwatch MHC has been able to engross me with her suberb character development and always unexpected plot twists. This is not so with You Belong to Me. The characters are extremely one-dimensional; their motivations and personalities are barely explored. In this book, more than any other, the standard of living portrayed and the attitudes of the characters are extremely pretentious. The characters are absolutely out of touch with the type of lifestyle that most people live. There are also many sterotypes prepetuated. I was extremely fustrated with this book and am increasingly displeased with MHC novels. They seem to follow the same plot line and have the same characters in each one, with only the names changed. I wouldn't reccomend this novel, unless you are trying to put yourself to sleep."
1,Don't waste your time,"I've always liked MHC, but this one seemed like she just combined all of her previous novels and changed the characters' names. It wasn't very interesting. It seemed to me like it was written in about two days without much careful planning. Dr. Susan Chandler is way too smart and yet not smart enough at the same time..."
3,"Felt ""cheated""",I purchased Canon Powershot G7 and this came up as an accessory. Only after receiving the package did I see that it was for G6. Loved the case but the battery was not the right fit.
1,Cheated too,I purchased Canon Powershot G7 and this came up as an accessory. Only after receiving the package did I see that it was for G6. Loved the case but the battery was not the right fit.
2,Dissatisfaction with pproduct and vendor return policy,"Canon product 3-piece kit. Bought it mainly for the camera case. Battery was added incentive to buy. Case was not up to standards, but this was not determinable until after I had opened the clamshell container. Unfortunately, this vendor does not permit returns on opened camera accessories, a fact I did not know until I'd already opened it. So now I'm out the cost of a kit I would not have otherwise have purchased. Clearly, I will not use this vendor again."
5,A rival for Bond,"Espionage with humour and charm! Really well written and with a host of great characters. The plot is so interesting and superbly paced that I found it hard to put down. Some of the anecdotes had me laughing out loud. If you haven't already read Akunin's work, I would recommend starting from his first novel in this series and work your way to this one. Although not critical, it will give you a more rounded understanding of our hero, Erast Petrovich Fandorin. He's not your typical James Bond type but Fandorin's character is a refreshing change to the standard Hollywood hero."
4,Another good Akunin mystery,"The Death of Achilles is a return to form for Akunin, with keenly drawn characters more reminiscent of Winter Palace than his later books. Not high art, but a fun summer read."
3,"Interesting, but not Suspenseful","Fandorin, the detective, is no Sherlock Holmes, as book jackets and readers often brand him. Where Holmes uses real, organic, logic and deduction, Fandorin only pretends to. I found this a slow-moving book, devoid of suspense or surprise. You knew from the outset how it would end and the only thing that made it remotely interesting were the contrived actions that Fandorin and several other characters executed and the descriptions of 19th century Moscow."
5,My favorite book in Fandorin series...,"This is the 4th book in Fandorin series, and it's my favorite one. This book is simply a masterpiece. Great plot. Well-created characters. It's got all the right pieces to it. Kept my attention from the beginning to the end. Boris Akunin rightfully deserved to be called one of the greatest mystery novel writers of modern time."
4,Practice at home,"My wife thinks the instructions are great. This way you make your mistakes at home , where no one will see you."
4,Happy With It,"Donald Johnson and Kasia Kozak are EXCELLENT instructors. Their dance DVDs are excellent. Plenty of demonstration and explanation. My experience has been, so far, that the ""Anyone Can Dance DVDs, are very easy to follow and learn from. Be careful though because some of the Latin DVD's are taught with the International style. This is an excellent DVD for beginners! However, it does teach enough moves for a very nice dance. I highly encourage it at a discounted price through Amazon. Excellent menu and sub-menu operations! Very quickly, you can go right to any spot on the DVD."
2,Looks Nice But ...,"For the price, the overall construction was decent but they really dropped the ball on the design of the mechanism where you switch from pull in to payout. On the one I bought, it did not provide enough pressure to hold the ratcheting mecahnism down when trying to pull in. I had to use (2) hands and manipulate the mechanism.When I went to release the tension, the unit would not ratchet out. It worked when I tried it unloaded before actually using the unit. Again, I had to use (2) hands.I bought the unit to bend my exhaust system so I was not anywhere near the advertized capacity.I did not contact Cummins about the problem so I cannot comment on what they would have done to rectify the situation. I would have sent the unit back but it was not worth my time and shipping costs."
4,TELLS IT LIKE IT IS...,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who runs marketing at a Fortune 500 company and who says he is buying copies for all his staff. Good move. This book is chock full of solid, useful examples-- most of which are common sense observations, but need to be highlighted. It's also extremely readable and insightful, even poignant in places. The author has done a real service. I'm sure this will be used for years to come-- in companies, large and small, as well as in the classroom."
4,Never had a problem,"I've done most of my use of this using 9/16"" brads, and have never had a problem. Never had the unit jam, never had it fail to fire. My use has been nailing luan (5mm) ply to frames so they can glue. The unit will occasionally leave an exposed brad head if it hits a hard part of the wood, but other than than, it's been fine. I've been rather surprised to see all the negative reviews. I'd love to know if the type, brand, or length of staple has anything to do with it."
1,absolutely useless,"I bought 5700M in the Home Depot some time ago, and it was one of more expensive staplers, so I hopped it was a reliable buy.Since then I used it just twice - I stapled some wire to the dry wall, and then I attempted to staple a sheet of poly to the studs, and this is where it died.First, it would not be able to insert larger staples (larger, but still in the size and brand recommended by the manual) - they would sit in the stud half way;Then, when I replaced the staples to a smaller size, it was able to process something like dozen, and then the handle broke and that was the end.Back in Home Depot I bought a Stanley to replace this junk, costs almost twice as little, and works flawlessly."
5,Good product,So far i have no complaints. I have used it on several projects and no jams or any problem to speak of to date.
1,Big Fat Jamming Disappointment,"Thought this was such a clever design. Way easier to get the staple where you want it to go, etc... But after about 15 staples, this thing jammed and I haven't been able to unjam it. Read a bit online about using multiple screwdrivers to unjam it but I don't think it's worth it. [...]"
1,Model 5700M - Worse Stapler I've Ever Owned,"This ARROW Model 5700M stapler was brand new out of the box today. I started my insulation job and it jammed on the eighth staple. I had to dismantle the stapler to clear the jam. It then jammed again about every eight to ten staples. It appeared to be jamming because the stack of staples (ARROW T50 Heavy Duty - 1/2 inch) were cocking over in the chamber to a 45 degree angle. Another extremely annoying feature is that the staple stack is 4 inches long out of the box but this stapler will only accept a three inch long stack. After clearing jams about a dozen times it began to jam every third staple. At that point I quit the job, losing a day's work, and tossed it into the trash. I'll never buy another ARROW product again in this lifetime."
1,POWERSHOT STAPES NOT AVAILABLE,"INITIAL PACKAGE of staples are wonderful. Refills not available. Must get Arrow, and they jam, break, multiple shoot, and make a big mess!Don't get one. Review -10 for wasting money."
2,Did not last,"While I liked the forward action of this stapler, I have not been able to get one that lasts. Had old style stapler which lasted for over a decade in light home owner use. But have gone through two of these staplers in last couple of years. Both refused to recock after driving a staple. Now I'm back looking for something better."
1,Junk,"It worked intitially (through Lowe's return period) but now will not fire a staple into any material whatsoever. Hold it against a board, press it with all your might, and it absolutely will not fire. Point it at the sky, pull, and it fires a staple far up into the wild blue yonder. Press it against the board, try again, no go... Point it at the sky, blam! Works great. Press it against the board, shake it, wiggle it, tilt it every which way, nothing. Towards the sky? Blam!I guess if you want to staple clouds to the clear blue sky, this would be a good tool. For any practical use, it's junk. I'm going to toss it and get a simple, traditional model. There should be a ""zero star"" rating for products like this."
1,A piece of garbage,"This stapler is the worst....constant jams, no-fires, misfires, and plain tiring to the hands. So much for their ergonomic design! I bought mine at Lowes and without a receipt (my bad) they won't refund. Don't waste your money on this stapler. I threw mine away and bought the simple one from Arrow...works like a charm."
1,Terrible,I too have had a terrible experience with this stapler. I've always used it with the Arrow T50 staples yet at best I get one good staple out of every 4 tries. It jams often and is just a total waste of time and money.
1,It blows.,"I loaded the unit with the recommended Arrow brand T50 staples. It took several tries before any staples fired. The unit successfully placed two staples, then the firing action jammed and refused to return to the ""ready"" position."
1,Worse than useless,If you like spending your time removing jams and taking your stapler apart this is your tool.Problem is that Arrow seems to have bought up the self space making it difficult to get any otherbrand of staples.
1,Stapler is garbage,"Bought one-used it for a while--jammed constantly-ended up tossing it in the trash--these are just horrible--DO NOT BUY ONE; Like the Arrow T-50's they used to be good, but no more!!!!!!!!"
1,jam city,"Have had this stapler for over four years. After the 1st year, of light use, it started to jam on every shot. Poor alignment on head parts, stop gun from firing. I do not recommend buying this gun."
1,I plead to your sense of sanity:,Do not buy this stapler... you have been warned.I'm an artist who attempted to use this stapler (2 of them) for the last year to staple my canvas on the stretcher bars. I finally put both of them on my driveway and proceeded to crush them with my vehicle.
1,Not the original...,"I had a Powershot staple gun for about 10 years, and it worked very well. But, it bit the dust today, an internal spring went sprung... Yep, time to buy a new staple gun. I went to the local home center and picked out another Powershot stapler. It was a lot cheaper than the 1st one I owned at $19. It looked like the old one in the packaging, but when I opened it I knew it was not even close to the original. The whole staple loading mechanics and actuator are redesigned in a cheaper version. I went out to the project I was working on and it locked up/jammed after about 20 staples. I had to slam the stapler on the plywood repeatedly to free it up. Then a load of staples fell out. I reloaded and tried again - same result it jammed! Well I am in the hunt for a new stapler. Perhaps a foreign made stapler would do better? This one claims Made in the USA on the packaging. Nice..."
1,Never buy this stapler,"The stapler got jammed after 30 minutes of use. Removing the jam required loosening two screws, but one one them got stuck too. The only thing that worked great was Amazon's return service."
1,STAY AWAY,"I had a Craftman with the same forward action that served me well for years with several ""purple hearts"" but kept on working. When it did finally die I picked up this Power Shot 5700 at a building center and it lasted for about 1/2 room of insulation and locked up! I will go back to the Craftsman!"
2,Jams like Labron James,This staple gun jams so much it is useless. Getting it unjammed usually requires a herculean effort using a screwdriver or other tool to wedge out a staple. This is a tiresome process that is necessary just about every time you use the stapler. Not recommended.
1,Concept great! ......Quality not!!!!,"Had this for little over a week, used it to repair wooden window screens.Was so impressed with how it worked compared to my other staple gun.So easy to drive staple in with this design.BUT......I used it today, after about 10 squeezes, it didn't spring back, and I removed staples to try and get this thing to operate but I found little plastic grey colored pieces fall out and now it's just RUBBISH!!!I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS STAPLE GUN!!!!Arrow, please improve this gun, concept is great but quality sucks!"
2,Used to be a good product!,"When I started making memory boards four years ago I grabbed my husband's staple gun. It was great. It lasted three more years, giving it a total of six years and two cross country moves. Since it was so awesome, I bought another one last year when it finally broke. I immediately noticed that it felt lighter than the old one. I figured it would be easier on my arm! A year later that one broke. I figured it was still a good product for the treatment I give it so when I broke I bought another one. That one lasted three days. Yep. Three days. I only put about 10 staples through it when it fell apart. I decided that the PowerShot staple gun is going way down in quality with each year this time I opted to get a pneumatic staple gun and it only cost me $4 more!"
1,Jams every 5 or 6 staples,Wish I would have read reviews about this product before I purchased it at Lowes (for $5 cheaper btw). You can't even get 10 staples out of the thing before it jams and the only way to get it un-jammed is take the screws out of the side and pull it apart. WAST OF MONEY. This thing is going back for sure!!
1,junk,"As with most of the other reviews, this gun is junk. Won't drive a 3/8"" staple into OSB board. Don't waste your money."
2,Lousy value,Stopped working within one year of light use; I expect more from a $20 stapler - didn't even get through 1 box of staples.
1,Don't waste your money,When hurricane Sandy hit NYC it blew out my front window. My downstairs neighbor came up to help me cover the opening with plastic sheeting. Coincidentally we both had PowerShot staplers. Neither worked. They shot one or two staples and then jammed. Repeatedly. I was using PowerShot staples. We spent more time clearing the staple guns than dealing with the situation. There is no excuse for making such a shoddy product. If I could give this a lower rating I would.
5,A Masterpiece,"This is a beautiful, hilarious, and moving portrait of a young boy growing up and trying to come to terms with the constricting, confusing, and conflicted society around him. As Noel Weatherspoon struggles with his own understanding of life and death, the reader is immediately drawn into his wild ride of a life, and left breathless and forever changed. Thank you, Lee Durkee. I can't wait to read whatever you write next."
1,Waste of Time,"I did not like this book at all. It started out fairly interesting, but gets more and more boring by the page. At times it was as if the author was trying to provide some sort of shock value with completely outrageous tales. The book can easily be summed up by saying the kid had no dad, abused drugs constantly, had the usual teenage sexual thoughts, and was a complete loser. That does not give away the ending, which also was not very good. The book was really drawn out and then comes to an abrupt end. Nice try though."
2,forgot i'd already read it,"i was looking for a novel to read recently, and found this on my bookshelf, remembering that i'd bought it a few years ago on a recommendation i read somewhere. i dove into it, and was digging it for a while. it's a sort of coming-of-age story, of a teenage (then college age) boy growing up in the deep south, in the 70s. but i started wondering where the heck the story was going. was it a morality tale? a ghost story? a character piece? just as i started to suspect i was wrong for my early-pages enjoyment of the book, i came to a startling realization. it was a good 3/4 through the book when i realized this: i'd already read the book. now, that tells me something, if i didn't even remember reading it (knowing it would have been in the last 4 or 5 years, at the most). and, though i finished it -- because i hate not finishing books -- it was like finishing a meal you are grossly disappointed with. don't bother."
3,flawed funny novel,"this is a good novel--it kept me reading, which is job number one for a writer. it is both funny and sad. the writing is sometimes lyrical, sometimes crude. each chapter contains an odd surprise or two.i believe durkee has created a character he may come back to some day."
5,GREAT RESEARCH,"This is a great heads up to whats going to happen in our near future. It also describes are Fractional Reserve debt-based monetary system, where money comes into existence primarily through private bank lending, can neither create, nor sustain, a stable economic environment (See HR 2990 National Emergency Employment Defense Act of 2011 for a brief summary of what this entails). Related books ""The Coming Famine"" by Julian Cribb."
1,"Don't buy the ""repackaged"" version","This so called ""repackage"" is a piece of junk. The plastic inserts are glued to the flimsy cardboard as if they were pages in a book. Mine arrived already falling apart and I cannot imagine this surviving even minimal use.Very disappointed. Waste of my time to get this and to have to box it up and return it. I don't care how cheap you get it ... you will be disappointed."
4,Kal-El i am your father,One of the greatest seasons to start off into Superman's journey into training. Best of all Lois lane comes in with all her annoying features that draw Clark closer to her.
5,Awesome,I'm very interested in what Superman's life might have been like prior to adulthood. This series lets you see that. It's really enjoyable.
2,When Genius Failed The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Managaement,"Dear Amazon,I placed an order for When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein at the same time I ordered Smallville - The Complete Fourth Season.I have a complaint not with the seller but with you. I purchased the book When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management by Roger Lowenstein from (I assumed) Amazon on line for $49.95 plus shipping ($53.44) but when I got the book the price on the book was $26.95. Why such a big price difference? I didn't realize I was getting it from a private party plus it took a month to get it.I was satisfied with the product and delivery of Smallville."
3,Smallville was better in season 1-2,"The new episodes are kind of crap, it seems that they dont have new cool ideas, and create scripts with the first thing that come to their minds."
1,Smallville Season 4 = train wreck,"It's a shame to see a show that was incredible for 3 seasons go down the tubes (Buffy is another prime example). The introduction of the convenient plot hole fixer, black Kryptonite, the poor-man's Whitney clone Jason, the absurd witch storyline [only fat, lesbian wiccas (witchcraft is NOT real, nor a religion folks)would like that trash)], Lois Lane's introduction and other ridiculousness took Smallville from greatness to garbage in less than a season. Also, this season recycles storylines and plots and beats them to death. For example, Clark on the football team again? Clark & Lana trying to hook-up again for the umpteenth time? Even the superior Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) has visible trouble delivering this drivel with his usual acting prowess. Hopefully, the producers learn from the disaster zone called Buffy season's 4-7 and rectify Smallville in the next season. Make Smallville good again."
5,Smallville is super!!!!!,"This may not be the best season but if you actually took the time to go through the special features you would know that it is beacause Kidder dropped out of the series and her charicter was an integral part of the writers plans. If I could I would give this 4.5 stars. Lois and Cloe bolth totaly rock!!! I still can't get the scene where martha sings ""It makes me wanna yah yah"" out of my head!! When I saw the season on TV it was somewhat dissapointing, but seeing it on this format it was nice to see a story realy last."
3,"boo-hoo,waa,waa","this would be a pretty decent show if the creators would tell the suits at the WB to stop trying to boost rating by introducing a new hunk or hot chick of the week.who has nothing to do with the Superman story, they're just there to take up episode time till the last 5 minutes of the show till we realize the next big thing they'll be saving for the following week's episode. what a waste of crap. the only thing keeping this show afloat is fighting bad guys and Tom Welling sans shirt. the good things i like about this show is hot chicks Alison Mack and Erica Duran. the rest is garbage."
4,Season 4,"The beginning of the fourth season I felt was very weak. But after January I thought the series took a different turn, which I thought it was great, not only developing the characters but also the man Clark Kent will become.I think that the end of this season defined the show as being different from any superman story ever presented to the public. It makes the show unique. It was a very good idea how instead of using Lois as his main love interest they kept Lana as the love of his life. As well as how Lex's intrigues confuse more and more the viewers whether to see him as the enemy or friend. The last episode is the best finally from all of the other seasons because everything unleashes and the true personality of each character comes out clearly."
4,Not as bad as you think!,"Most people think this is the worst of all the seasons. At first I agreed with them but I have found that watching the full season on DVD after seeing it on TV, it's not that bad.Once you get over the teeny bopper thing that the WB does then the story lines are good.And for the reviewer that cut out the parts for there 10 year old boy, ""Live in the now!"""
4,Last Best Season,"Season 4 is awesome, there is more sex, drugs, and rock n roll then the other ones, it has more high tempo episodes, which this is my favorite season, season 3 was awesome but season 4 is better. Season 5 is a big let down. In season 4 Clark gets married, gets Lana back, loses his dad to save Lana. But also which is awesome is Lana Lang in the Superman Movies with Christopher Reeve, Lana Lang is played by the same actress who plays Clark's mom, Martha Kent."
5,A tv wonder,"Smallville is one of the smartest and interesting tv shows on at the moment. Its got everything you want from a long running show. Everything you need to make it long running and the cast you want to watch for a long running series. If your not a long running fan, or your new to smallville, do yourself a favour and buy Smallville."
4,A different direction,"I bought season four to complete the seasons I had already been watching while in Iraq. To be honest, At first I was a little disapointed, but with first disc down I realized they were just taking the plot in a new direction so as to ease into the college episodes. It really is a great buy and would recommend it for anyone who like the show. but you got to own the first three saesons before understanding what going on."
3,Better than any season of Charmed,"Some of the reviews are harsh for S4 of SV. I was very entertained this season and rewatched all of the season I had recorded again leading up to the next season which debuts next week. The great sound that is in these DVDs, the clarity of the picture and of course no commercials or channel branding (fresh episode, wb, etc) is a good reason to buy these and I'm going to, but I'm waiting until the price drops. There's hardly any special features on these DVDs. I know Tom Welling is a busy guy, but COME ON...not a single commentary on any of the episodes from any season since the beginning of the series. It's not like he's Elvis."
5,"good product, great value","bought this as a christmas present to my bro in law, great value cant beat that."
1,Show went downhill with the arrival of Lois Lane.,"The first three seasons were great . Many of the changes to the revamped origin of Superman were an enhancment to the Superman mythos like the kryptonite meteors playing a significant role , new characters, Lex Luthor's increased involvement, and especially the relationship between Clarke and Lana Lang.I don't mind if the producers and writers change things in the established history of a character if it actually improves the characters and the stories, especially an iconic 65 + year history. For 3 seasons it has worked. I would even let the fact that the show never adressed the issue of where in America Smallville is located. It's supposed to be in Kansas but it seems like Metropolis is only a few hours drive away if you know what I mean.The producers however crossed the line when they brought Lois Lane in. Lois Lane is a important character in Clark's life as an adult. Lana Lang is Smallville. Why ruin a good thing?"
2,"writers alienate their conservative, family audience","One of Smallvilles best qualitys in the early seasons was the relationship between Clark and his Dad (John Schnieder)andclarks progress in becoming a great man.Nowadays Dads are portrayed as either non-existent or idiots. Bringing in Witches, Vampires and more sexual content was a big mistake, I know many people who ended theirSmallville experience with this Season. Thankfully the series got somewhat away from this in later seasons."
3,"worst season of the show, but the best show ever!","I love Smallville, but I've got to say that this season sucks, The only good chapter is the last one of the season, I'm very dissapointed of this season, but still, Smallville is one of the best shows taking out the fourth season"
4,"Not the best season, but it still wasn't bad.","I agree with alot of what was said in other reviews. The Countess/witch thing with Lana, they could have done without that, but at the same time it gave everyone a chance to see Lana, Lois, and Chole dressed really sexy in ""Spell"". If they were going to bring Krypo the super dog into the story, they should have writen the story better, but everyone has to admit, the introduction of black kryponite (nice tribute to superman 3 by the way). But everyone has to admit episode 1, and the finally were great, along with the story line of the stones of power leading up to the Fortress of Solitude. So all in all, this wasn't the best season for smallville, but everyone has to admit, it wasn't the worst."
2,Bad presentation. Smallville Season 4 DVD box set,"I was really looking foward to adding season 4 to my collection. I wasn't expecting the DVD to be in new condition at all. But when I opened to box case, the disc holders (clear plastic ones) were falling out, hanging only by the sticky thing that the company usually puts on the case. Also, some discs would actually fall out. Overall, I did not really enjoy the presentation of the item but I did enjoy having the season, I just thought the case for the DVDs would've been in better quality than they were."
3,I'm a superman fan but...,The 4th season of Smallville catered way too much to teens. Many DC fans are not teenagers and can appreciate when occasional villains like Mr. Mxyzptlk are thrown in an episode. The problem is when time is wasted on relationship type issues between Clark and Lana or frequent make-out scenes of high school students. I'm a big fan of the canceled series and it pains me to give it only 3 stars but I have to be honest when I compare it against other seasons.
5,Great DVD Set,Discs were in excellent condition. Did not have any trouble playing it. DVD case came in brand new. Would purchase this product again
5,Senior Year...,"The legend continues.... Smallville takes a fresh look of Clark Kent and all the trials and tribulations he faces growing up in Kansas. An awesome ensemble, great writing, and cool music bring Smallville to life in this first season set. A must have for all those who are fans of Truth, Justice, and the American Way!! The fourth season finds our group in their senior year of high school. The only down side is the addition of Lois Lane to the story, but she does offer some comic relief."
2,Keep Your Eye on the Ball,"I've seen every episode of SV since it's inception and I admit I was mesmorized by how great the writing was and direction the show was taking, but S4 lost it. The direction for the show is to get us to Superman. How does Clark develop his self sacrificing persona, that defends the weak and beleives in the best about mankind. None of that exist. It is Martha Kent who creates Superman, when Clark greives over the death of Jonathan Kent. Lex Luthor is not only rich, but he's smart, the level of genius portrayed by Lex is far below the comic nemisis of Superman. Lex' desire is to take over the world, I don't see that. The story is How Clark Kent and his best friend Lex Luthor become such bitter enemies that the world shakes, that's the story!!!S4 lost its way and S5 dosen't look any better.The writers have lost their originality and will lose their fan base as well."
5,I'm 53 freakin' years old and...,haven't looked forward to a season opener (season 5!) nor enjoyed a season ender (season 4) since Captain Picard was 'borgerized'. Thanks!
3,Smallville Series 4,"The same old boring series in the first 4 episodes, nothing exciting, I wish it would get movingEd Staar"
5,Sweet collection,"I was fortunate enough to buy Seasons 1-3 at Target for a sizable discount a while back. Now, my brother and sisters have gotten in on the Smallville fever, so I was looking to add Seasons 4-6. Thanks for helping me to start meeting that goal."
2,What happened to the packaging??,"OK, so the packaging in all of the seasons has been sub-par. In every season I have purchased the plastic trays have detached from the cover before it's even opened. With season 4 however something seems to have gone even worse. The trays are much thicker and heavier than previous seasons, and even the later seasons. This caused the box to be much bigger on the shelf than all the others. Disc 5 in the set I received came so badly scratched it will not play any of the episodes. What's strange is that the disc was not loose, it was still attached to the tray when I opened it. It looks like a cat went at the back of it with it's claws. I'm not sure why they went with this horribly worse packaging for season 4, but it was a terrible idea."
4,Fails in some ways,"Overall, this season is a watchable one. Nevertheless, the Lana Lang character is just plain insignificant. The plus is Lois, such a fresh character."
5,Awesome,"Personally I started watching this series when it first came out, but I got my girlfriend hooked on it, and of course she had to have all nine seasons. :/This is a great series if anyone is looking for something to watch. In a nutshell it's the up-and-coming story of Superman as a teenager in his home town of Smallville."
5,Smallville,"I was very happy with my purchase of season four of Smallville. I bought it for the first appearance of Bart Allen, but ended up enjoying the whole set. Totally worth the money.Now, if only they would make The Justice League into a series, Life would be good."
1,A Major Disappointment...,"We've watched Smallville episodes from the first season and I have to conclude that this fourth season lacks the luster of the other three!There is WAY TOO MUCH ""SKIN"", sex, witchcraft, and other debauchery taking place in this fourth season. And get over the Lana Lang thing, already, please!! Bringing her back into Smallville from Paris was OK, but enough with the Clark/Lana love tangle. It's stupid.The only positive thing about this series is the introduction of up-beat, funny, Lois Lane. Gotta love her. Her quick witted character adds a lot of charm and grace to an otherwise disgraceful season."
3,Smallville,"This series is definitley not for everybody. I received a lot of criticism from family and friends and was banned from watching it in their company! But if you're a sci-fi, comic fan and more specifically super-man fan, you are most likely to enjoy it. There are episodes where I thought they took thing too far, but on the whole, a good series. I say its worth giving a look see."
3,I get a weird feeling,"Each time I watch episodes from this series I get a weird feeling. This season is very focused, mainly on the relationships with each character instead of the superpower aspect. Firstly, there was this episode where Lex and Jason team up to go against Genevieve, Jason's mother, and Lionel, Lex's father. To see this two team up is a terrible thing, especially when Jason and Lana don't match up either. Secondly, why all the lustful episodes? One episode has Alicia frantically trying to keep Clark in her clutches, another has cheerleaders trying to use a love potion on the football players, and another has a lot of women clamouring over Clark. One good point is that they've given up on all the superpower mojo, though now the season looks like a cross between Charmed and The O.C."
3,FOURTH SEASON OF SMALLVILLE,"I liked it, but it diffenantly my least favorite seasons, but since I love SMALLVILLE or anything SUPERMAN I was just disappointed I hated the character Jason and Lois Lane was great. I think they make every guy Lana is with just a weak guy. I'll still get this because I still think it is worth getting if you're a die hard fan of the show."
2,How the mighty have fallen - from Classic to teeny bopper drama,"This show rapidly went down the toilet season 4. I love this show and we used to watch it as a family (my children, wife, and me). However, I no longer recommend it to anyone. Apparently the producers got the bright idea to have a plotless teenage drama instead of a superman show about superman as a teen.Lex, by far the best actor and most intriguing character, disappeared from this season. That was a terrible shame.The writers are out of ideas. Kryptonite this, kryptonite that. Lana whine, Lana whine. The interesting characters, Chloe and Lex, are sidelined for stupid plots. The show obviously has a very teeny bopper feel now.If you are a teenager, you might like the show. However, if you like Superman and good plots I strongly recommend the previous 3 seasons. So sad."
4,Good episode,Episode was really good. It would of been better if Lex was the one that took over Clark's body.none the less it was good episode
4,Some odd story arcs but mostly good fun,"There are some rather odd story arcs here that do not totally work, such as the extended bit about the stones and Lana being possessed by a witch from 400 years ago. These make it a bit goofy at times.Otherwise, however, there are some very moving scenes with Clark and his parents, a boy named Evan who grows much too quickly, dogs being used in experiments--fortunately the Kents get to rescue one--and more good scenes of conflict and tension between the Luthor men, not to mention the introduction of Jane Seymour and Jensen Ackles as a no-good mother and son team who prey on Lana, among others. Chloe also gets a good close look at the real Clark Kent."
5,A Triple Header That Actually Works!,"I normally shy away from novellas because;#1) I know I'll be lucky to find one good story of the three#2) the plots are so thin I find it nearly impossible to care about the characters#3) by the time I get into the story, it's over.What a pleasureable surprise ""Dare Me"" turned out to be! All three of these steamingly sexy, edgy adventure stories were great - the characters were easy to love, the plots quickly drew me in, stayed interesting and kept me clinging to their very satisfying endings. I'm still not sure how every author managed to pull this off, but they certainly did so quite successfully."
4,Automation Changes Explained,"The articles and contributors to this book represent the story of an industry undergoing significant change and should be read by anyone interested in the impact technology has on them, without their awareness, while also showing how this industry is part of the global investment and economy. Pinto's observations and commentary on the industrial automation world as it enters the 21st century in a state of transition and some say turmoil also provides insight into other industries as well.If you are entering into, departing from, or interested in today's networked world as an engineer, sales person, or investor this book provides a glimpse of how it all relates in a very readable way."
5,Fantastic...,"I have been looking for something like this for a while. For someone who plays Star Trek RPG with friends this is completely indispensable. The detail and richness of this book are fantastic. Almost the entire known universe is available at the end of the book with 4 large foldout maps that fit together if taken out. It features anything that is know, any planet and race and star system that was mentioned anywhere. The print is razor sharp and glossy in high color.One thing I would have added to this book is a planet and star index with page and coordinates in order to find things easier. Other than that i give it 5 stars anyway."
5,Star Trek Star Charts: The Complete Atlas of Star Trek - Review,"Beautifully illustrated and imaginatively presented collection of star maps for the Star Trek series! Every Trekkie or Trekker should own one. Even if you're only mildly interested in the fantasy side of space exploration and Science Fiction creations, the ""Star Trek Star Charts: The Complete Atlas of Star Trek"" will provide plenty of food for daydreams about ""what's out there?"" I combined my purchase with that of ""The Star Trek Encyclopedia"", which gave me an added dimension of explanation. My Star Trek Experience now has a 4th dimension. Brilliant!!!"
2,HUH?,"After reading ""Elim Garak""s review I had to sayGeoffery Mandel is not 'new'. He's been around since the seventies,worked with Andrew Probert, Rick Sternbach and Lee Cole.Kind of wish he hadn't done this, contradicts some earlier work,however I ditto Alex Rozenswieg's comments earlier here."
1,beatles1962,"Curious book, lots of map, classification of planets, etc. I expected it to have more info about Archer's Enterprise, who mapped what, where Archer stooped and where Kirk stsrted. Or more info about the relantioship between the Vulcan High Comand and Stargeet, but the book has som 100 pages of maps, based in some stuff that recllad the ""cold war"" period or ven the North/South Korea stuff. Expcted a more informative book, as an Atlas falls short...hardcore fans may disagree, but there mut be better books..."
4,If you like Star Trek and you like maps...,"Then you are going to love this book. It is full of illustrations of the Star Trek world. Locate Vulcan, Andoria or Ocampa! The book is broken down into sections devoted to the divisions of the galaxy. A lot of research went into preparing this book and it shows. Full color beautiful artwork accompanies the research and makes Star Charts a must have for any Trek fan."
3,Beautiful But No Index,"This is a very beautiful book which every Trekker will want to own. However I cannot give it five stars because there is no index! The charts do not have letters and numbers so individual stars and planets cannot be located! This is a huge disappointment. What I wanted to do was to find the location of the stars and planets visited by Kirk, Picard, Janeway, et. al. for each particular episode--but this is very difficult to do without an index. Also, there are numerous errors, as pointed out by other reviewers. And it needs to be updated to cover Archer's adventures (Star Trek: Enterprise). Nonetheless, I still recommend purchase...because there is nothing better."
3,Star Trek Star Charts: The Complete Atlas of Star Trek,"Book give's a vieu on how the universe looks like seen from the eyes of the Star Trek crew.It give's you an idea where you are by following the movie or dvd'sHope you can make something out of it, not used to write english.Enjoy it as mush as I do"
3,Very Artistic But lacks substance,I was really hoping that there would be star charts of the Alpha Quadrant. The book is hard to follow at 1st. The art is excellent and the Voyager route home pages are great. But the book lacked a lot of detail. The section on how the quadrants/sectors are all divided up is cool. This is not a star chart guide as much as it is a galactic overview. It lacks a lot of detail.
4,I am glad I found the Star Trek Atlas.,"Overall, this book was entertaining, and is worth every penny. The color charts are appealing, and informative. I know where wolf 359 was, I know where founders' homeworld is, I know how close Cardassia is to the Earth etc... Now that I have a map, it makes sense whyThere were a few things the book should have included: A 3-D map since space is not 2 dimensional; a map of the entire galaxy on a fold-out would have been nice."
4,"Visually rich, but...","This book is glossier than it appears on the website and I was pleasently surprised. It is no doubt a collector's item.One small observation: The sector numbering system is inconsistent with earth sector being called sector 001 in ""Best of both worlds - ST:TNG"", The illustrations are very good, the stars and planets are designed nicely. Geographic classification details - worthy of praise. Overall a good reference book for all trekkies.One word about graphics, though. The typography of page headers and bold lines in diagrams make it look like a kid's book. It is not. Star Trek is NOT a kid's fantasy. It is a great collaborative project of talented writers, scientists, engineers, graphic designers (and evident from this book - maybe even astrophysicists). It is one work of fiction that is made to look and feel like non fiction. I wish this book was designed like the interfaces by Michael Okuda that appear in the show."
4,Extremely well done graphics,"Very high-quality, full color graphics on every page. Diagrams of every part of the 'known' galaxy. Flight paths of the all the series' major ships (including several pages of Voyager's journey home from the Delta quadrant). Nice catalog of all the planet types (class M etc.) as well as the known planets (Earth, Vulcan, Q'onoS etc.)Definately belongs in any Trekies' library."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I'm not in the mood to get into a long-winded thing here, but I bought this game based on customer reviews and now I know that customer reviews don't mean jack. This game does have 5 games in one, but they all suck. I bought this game for the portal game, the game I thought was the king of all 5 games. It's not. It's the lamest thing I've ever seen. It's a bunch of rooms that randomly open and close, it's a puzzle game. The other games are Half Life 1, 2 and 3, but they're really all the same lame game. The 5th game isn't playable unless you're online, so I've never seen it work.By the way I'm a 34 y/o dude from NYC. Call of Duty 4 and Tony Hawk Proving Ground are games worth buying. This one isn't."
5,AmAzInG GaMe!,This game is truly a must have for video gamers. It's been rated 9.5 out of 10 and it well deserves it. It's 5 games on 1 disc and it's packed with hours of exciting game play. purchase this game and you will not regret it!
4,Portal saves the day,"I really don't get why people love Half-Life so much. Sure, Gordon Freeman is super badass and the gravity gun kics ass, but you just run around killing the exact same 4 or 5 kind of bad guys over a bazillion hour game. Much like halo.I imagine Team Fortress is amazing, it looks like it, but whenever I play it, it seems like the other dudes already know so much about the game that it'll take me forever to catch up with them. I don't even know which character to pick.And then there's Portal. If you haven't played this game, you can't call yourself a human being. You're more like a zombie with a turkey for a head. I can't even think of a way to describe how good this game is, so I'll let you read some other review, written by a guy that makes sense. Just play Portal, and if you find that you don't like it... well, Sir, you belong in jail.Best of luck."
4,Good variety of popular games,"Nice selection of popular games for the casual gamer, as my son is at this point. Low-frustration, good resolution graphics, easy to use for beginners to the XBOX community. Definitely subscribe to XBOX Live, tho', for max enjoyment of system."
4,Great game.,"It didn't live up to my expectations entirely based on how critically acclaimed this game is, but it is still an above average first person shooter with an above average story. I recommend it to anyone looking to spend around 15 hours playing a quality shooter."
5,Great,"I ordered this from warehouse deals.I bought it used, when i recieved it it looked brand new. It was in packaging like a new game. Upon opening it i could tell it was used, but it was in great shape and could barely tell it had been used. Its a great game and I highly recommend it."
5,Wow Buy for the xbox 360 if you dont have a good pc,"Ok i have a pretty good computer i can play Half Life 2 to almost top specs, but episode 1 had so many problems, anyway i always wanted half life 2 on a console but the graphics were pathetic and did not compare to the pc. When it came for out for the 360 i had to get it, and man was i impressed 5 games for the price of one, and theylook amazing i have a nice hd tv surrond sound and i was blown away so much better than my pc trust me graphics top notch. so if you ever wanted to play half life at top specs get this now. Now about game play come on its half life ok its the best game ive ever played and the best fps on any system, team fortress is fun and portal is a thinker you will spend awhile to get through this game in the end this game was amazing get it."
5,Great Game,"This is one of my favorite computer games, so to have it on the Xbox was even more fun. I was very pleased with this... It's awesome!!!"
5,Orange Box=Portal,"ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, THE BOMB. FANTASTIC. IT WAS A TRIUMPH, A COMPLETE SUCCESS. IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE MY SATISFACTION. GOTTA GET IT. DO IT. NOW."
4,Portal was the better than half-life 2,plain and simple the Portal game they have on it is better than the other dont get me wrong half-life 2 is ok but portal i alot more interesting but its short but hey for 20 dollars its worth it
5,Good game over all,"The shipping was fast and be for i knew it i was play portal on the console for the very first time, and half-life one and two with all episodes, and then team fortress was a new experience very good game. I cant wait for portal 2"
5,Awesome sauce deal. Stronger then Chuck Norris.,"Heh. I love this game. It's 5 games on one disc with a cool selection screen. I mean if I'm playing Half Life 2 and I beat, typically I'd have to go out and buy the sequal, but nope. With the OB I can just go back and start playing Episode 1, Portal, or TF2. The controls are very fluid with few glitches and fits very well from the PC versions. However there were a few issues where I got stuck between a wall but that's pretty much all. The only other thing I have against it is no splitcreen on TF2 and it has to be played online and that's all."
5,That's a whole lotta game,"If you have 2 useable thumbs and have ever enjoyed a first-person shooter you cannot go wrong with this game. Atmosphere, gameplay, and narrative weave together seamlessly in this collection of 5 games. Buy it."
4,it's almost worth 20 bucks,"The portal alone is worth a few dollars, with the 1/2 life it should be worth about 15-20 bucks on it's own. However, the team fortress 2 add on is just useless. It's pointless to play if you have halo or one of the cod's. Thus, I'm only rating it decent based on value and the price. Anything over 20 bucks would be ridiculous though."
3,I bought Orange Box just to play Portal,"Portal is one of my favorite games. I played it briefly when it first released. I decided to buy Portal 2 when it released earlier this year. I enjoyed the sequel so much that I decided to buy the original. I literally bought the orange box for Portal... I haven't even thought about playing the other games. I'm sure Half Life and Team Fortress are good games, but I haven't gotten around to playing them. I rated the overall game 3 stars because I haven't played the entire game, only portal.Bottom line... if you like puzzle games, you will love portal."
4,Great Value for Half-Lifers,"If you loved Half Life and Especially Half-Life 2 for XBOX this game lets you play HL2 on the 360 PLUS gives you two new ""episodes"" following-on immediately after HL2. I was stoked to replay HL2 and the new episodes are very satisfying (again, from the POV of n HL2 lover).Have not Portal'd or the other dealio yet, as am still enjoying ""Episode 2"" But if you liked HL2 on the original XBOX, you will want to get this game."
5,"HL 2 & Episode 1 & 2 Very Solid, Portal Fantastic!","I always liked Half Life, not as slick as Halo, but the plot and puzzles are really interesting.I Played both one and 2 on the PC and original XBox. 360's graphics are better, other than that the same.Episode 1 and 2 follow very well on the original Half Life 2 and bring a nice closer to it, although it doesnt present much new technology or interesting stuff. At least the Combine is gone for good, Right!, Right? Well probably not.Portal is a little gem though and worth the cost of entry all by itself. The main theme of the portal gun is really, really fun and the ever more difficult puzzles are very interesting and tricky to figure out, and then there is the one running the show. You are a rat in a maze and the maze runner has a real sense of humor.Portal reinvents all the original novelty and out of the box thinking that was present in the first Half Life.Congratulations Valve. (The Cake is not a Lie!)"
3,Orange Box,Fun puzzle game. Purchased because it had a variety of games on it and it was something different to play.
5,Sweet!!,Awesome game i really recommend buying it from here if you want it new because they dont manufacture it any more so you will only find used ones at game stores but amazon has new copies and in great condition. :)
5,Just buy it - the finest video game package EVER,"I was not a fan of any valve products before I bought this. I am now a convert! Portal of course is amazing but the Half-Life 2 and Episodes are incredible. Incredible. And Team Fortress 2 is no slouch. So much replay here.Gameplay - 10/10 brilliant pacing, exciting sequences, and games that don't treat you like you're 5. Also, innovative mechanics, very very few bugs, and stable performanceGraphics/Art - 10/10 especially for it's time. It still holds up very well. The art direction on these games is some of the finest ever in the industry.Story - 10/10 for all but TF2, which doesn't really have (or need) one. Minimalist but perfectionist storytelling, throughtful and meaningful plots.Writing - 10/10 especially Portal. Self-explanitorySound - 9/10 ambient, creative, interesting but not groundbreaking.Replay value - 9/10 for the Box as a whole, mostly in Portal challenges and TF2Yeah, this Box is an all-time favorite."
5,An Adult Point of View,"I became familar with this game, or at least ""Portal"", on a train ride from Prague to Berlin. It started with hearing the song by ""Gladys"" (?) on my teen's IPOD & went from there.As a 50+ year old, I can truly say that Portal is the only video game I ever saw that is worth a GD. That's it folks."
4,One Of A Kind,"This is the bands' second album. Not as psycho as the first one, but it rocks. More neo-rockabilly, more melodic, fast and better produced than the first one. It has something that reminds me of the Stray Cats. All songs are GREAT, with exception of Paint it Black, which is nothing new."
5,Excellent Story Children Love,"I am a kindergarten teacher and year after year this is our favorite class book. Even children who don't have the attention span to listen to stories, are excited about this book. My classes ask me to read it over and over again."
4,The Longest Hair in the World is hilarious!,"When Emily blows out the candles on her birthday cake, she knows exactly what to wish for: the longest hair in the world. When her wish comes true, things get a little too hairy.Be very careful what you wish for is the solemn moral of this hilarious story about a girl who wants to be the princess in a school play & the only way she can get the role is to have the longest hair in her class. Great fun!"
4,Easy Call That Seems to Work,"This was one of my first speck calls, and I like it. I just got into speck calling, but so far, I've been able to call a few birds in with this one. I have a few others, but I find myself reaching for this one most often. It seems to get the birds' attention. It is pretty easy to use; it doesn't require a lot of voice or tongue tricks. Just a little back-pressure with your hand and you'll get it to break."
3,Great thesis but flawed delivery,"The topic is fascinating, and when Elkins talks about specific works of art he is great. Unfortunately, when he talks about emotions he doesn't say much and he repeats his few points insufferably; a good editor would have trimmed this book by a quarter. That said, Elkins' thesis that we've forgotten how to engage with paintings emotionally - and the role that museums and art historians play in this development - will stay with you and affect the way you look at art in the future.Also note that the formatting for the Kindle is terrible. Particularly galling when the publisher is charging twice the usual rate for ebooks."
3,Good for what it is...,"Recorded during the ""Fallen Angel"" tour, this is a good representation of the Lawton-era lineup in concert. High points: all of the material originally recorded by that lineup is excellent; particularly fun is an extended version of ""Who Needs Me"". Low points: Lawton butchers most of the Byron-era material, oversinging it, and losing all the subtlety and sense of dynamics that Byron originally brought to it."
5,Fun for Feldman Fans,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend, who loves listening to Michael Feldman's program--in fact, her main birthday gift was a ticket to see the show in person! This was a wonderful follow-up gift -- she hooted over the bobble-head, which is now on the dashboard of her work truck. A group of us have played the game, and we never get tired of saying ""Whad 'Ya Know? Not much. You?"" I won best birthday gifts by a mile!"
2,wasn't a hit,I thought this was going to be a fun game to play but it's kind of dumb. There are better games out there.
2,a relative letdown from the show,"it's just not fun enough to play in a group because the play flow isn't intuitive. plus, overall the fun factor is missing. imo, it seems that all the players really need to love the show and put in 110% to make the game fun."
5,Comfy shoes,"I always enjoy ordering from Amazon, I receive my orders quickly and I have always been very pleased.Thank you"
2,Not what they used to be,Since receiving my last 2 pairs I see the product has changed considerably. They are now made in China and they feel like cardboard and don't fit as well either. I loved these sandals but I guess it is time to fine a new one - I also used to buy their mules but they too have changed. They are also made in China and are no where near as comfortable. Very disappointing!!!I have been looking for more of these sandals since I purchased my first pair at least 3 years ago. I am still wearing that pair and now I have an additional 2 pairs (great price). Based on the first pair they hold up great and they are so comfortable. I have bunions and I call my Clarks orthopedic shoes indisguise. Even sneakers are not as comfortable especially noticed on an all day shopping excursion. Just love them.
2,sandal,"I bought these because they were on Sale ""Cheap"" and that is what I got.Leather is very thin, and definately looks better in the picture"
2,C larkes sandals,My wife was very dissapointed with the Clarkes sandal. It was not the same as the one she had before. I returned them
5,Everyone should have a pair of Clarks and the Vendor rocks,I could not find Clarks in any stores near my home so I went online. I should have bought two pair of different colors since I tend to wear them EVERY day during summer. Clarks are the best sandals ever. They arrived quickly and not overly packaged but yet safe. The whole thing was a good experience.
4,Color misrepresented,"I ordered the Clarks Sunbeat Sandal to replace a pair that I had worn out, and was pleased to see that the color (Midnight Blue) in the photograph was exactly the same as my old pair. However the product that arrived, while certainly a Midnight Blue, is much darker than the color in the image.The website needs to re-photograph the ""Midnight Blue"" sandal so that shoppers will see the color they are ordering."
2,defective fit,"I've bought Clark sunbeat sandals for years- usually two or three pair each summer. These were defective. The holes were not punched through, making adjustment impossible. Worse, the right show is a very different fit from the left. The right requires all straps to be on the last hole (and they're still tight) while the left straps are on the second or third hole. This is a problem I've never encountered with other sunbeats. I expect more, given the price."
5,clark's sandals,"Sandals were exactly what I wanted and the delivery was fast. This is my first purchase on Amazon, but it won't be my last."
5,Clarks sunbeat sandles,I have ordered this sandles before. But the service was first class. delivery within days. I will certainly order from this company again
4,comfort but dye problems,"I've loved wearing the two pairs of these sandals that I have, and they've held up really well. The tan ones have been fine, but the blue-dyed ones got wet once, and they stained my feet blue quite badly. It was very hard to remove, and I went around with very odd-looking feet for quite a while. I'd like to buy more because they adjust to fit my narrow feet, but I'm afraid the black ones will stain my feet black if I get caught in the rain."
1,torture on your feet,"I used to love these sandals but no longer. Unknowingly I recently bought another pair and they are no longer made in England, but in China. The quality of the leather and workmanship of them is so poor. The leather is so coarse that I could not walk in them for more than an hour before I got terrible blisters. The fit is awful. The sole of the sandal is the same size for several sizes--they just adjust the strap closer in the back to make the correct size. How disappointing. This was my favorite summer sandal. I will never buy the Clarks brand agin since their product is made so cheaply. You won't buy them either is you listen to me first."
2,Wide size is not wide enough!,I have only slightly wide feet but the wide size fits like regular. Otherwise the fit is true to size. Returned.
3,Comfortable but the size is not right.,"The leather is soft and the shoes are comfortable but the actual size is larger than usual. I bought the size 6.5, which I always wear. When I put them on,the strap at the heel was far behind my ankle and could not be adjusted."
1,threads are sticking my skin,I have not been able to wear these shoes without severe pain. The sewing thread holding the latch pokes into the top of my foot and makes it sooooooo sore.
2,quality aint what it used to be,I have 2 other pairs of Clark's sandals purchased several years ago. The leather in this new pair is of lesser quality than my old ones. It is stiff and unyielding and therefore not particularly comfortable. The old ones have soft pliable leather. I will not buy another pair
4,the MOST comfortable sandal,I've had many pairs of these Clark sandals because they are the most comfortable sandal I've ever owned. They give great support and are good for walking. This price was excellent.
5,Clarks sandals,These are my vetry favorite sandals. I wore out my first pair so I was delighted to find them still available on Amazon. They were shipped to me quickly and packaged well for shipping.
2,Time is catching up with Levon,"While the production is of this dvd is good the singing of Levon has deteriorated. Levon's choice of old rhythm and blues is understandable. However, sometimes the his voice is strained and cracks to the point of making me uncomfortable.The band here is really good and lacks nothing.Lastly, being a The Band fan from 1968 until now, Levon's drumming is also slipping a bit. I suspect he misses the tug and pull of his ol' mate Rick Danko.I do own every disc and video available by The Band members and The Band. However, this one is for the completist and those seeking a souvenier of the show."
2,"Lukewarm, with a vague ending and too many loose ends.","Excellent premise: In love with a murderer. Gradually, things grow tamer and more whimsical, until the story is muddled and meandering. The ending leaves too many things unresolved. I found that the first half of the book was intriguing. Kim was a murderer, and he draws Lynn in. This alone lends him a certain dark mystique. The rest of the book seems to be an attempt to justify his crime, when no justification is required. (or even desired!) The lyric richness of the novel is what saves it. Ms. Neimark's descriptions and style are like elegant poetry with the occasional stunning twist."
3,OK,Not worth the price paid. OK but you can make your own with less trouble and it will taste better
5,YUMMY!,"Well, I made the Yorkshire Pudding last night with a roast beef dinner....it was excellent. Tasted just like my English Mother used to make us from scratch many years ago. Can't wait to make another!"
1,I have not receive it yet!!!!! This is absurd!,"They shipped it at the beginning of December. I still haven't received it as of January 7th. This product was part of a Christmas gift, so I had to purchase a replacement from a local store. Since they'd already shipped it, I couldn't cancel the order. Awful service."
5,canon gadget bag,"Buying a camera bag over the internet I had questions as to if it would really meet my needs. I was very impressed with it once I got it. The delivery date was right on. It has enough space for me to put my Canon Rebel with 18-55mm lens on it directly in the bag, and my 70-250 lens plus almost anything else I wanted. It is a great bag to carry all of your camera needs. I am still not use to carrying that much stuff with me (while walking around) since I made the switch from a simple point and shoot camera. But once I got use to it I was glad I had everything at my finger tips. This is a very good bag for the price and the description did a great job of explaining the bag."
5,Plenty Of Room,"The bag looks nice and is very roomy. Has enough room for my Canon HG10 and my Canon DSLR w/extra lense. Plus room for the chargers/batteries. The one thing that I do dislike about it is the size of it. Its a little bulky carrying it around with you on vacations/trips. In my opinion, you use this to carry everything in it initially but if your just looking to use your video camera one day or your DSLR the other I suggest purchasing something a little less bulky. Overall I'm glad I made the purchase but I also ended up buying something on the medium to small end to be able to carry it around all day without it being a nuisance."
4,Nice bag (but not the one for me),"This is a BIG gadget bag. Great bag if you have multiple lenses and in need of a sturdy bag that will carry it all. Agree with all the other positive reviews. But I need a bag for my camera and just one lens. Don't want to carry this big bag around for now, so I am returning it. Maybe when I buy more lenses, I will buy this.So if you need a big bag, this is the one for you. Otherwise, go for a smaller one with a better fit for camera and one lens...."
4,"Great camera bag, a little big","I purchased this camera bag before a trip to Hawaii. It's a great bag that allows you to safely carry much more than just the camera (lenses, batteries, etc.). The only ""issue"" is that the bag is somewhat bulky. We knew this, but we needed a safe way to carry an expensive camera and additional lenses. If you are looking for a bag for your camera along with other gadgets you need, this is it. If you are just looking for a bag that will carry only your camera, I would suggest something smaller."
4,Great Bag,Great bag at a good price - plenty of padding and moveable inner compartments - fits the camera that it was intended for!
3,big bag,"this bag is good for carrying all the items that go with the camera, but it is big for a general day out wile taking pics. if you don't mind the bulkyness, this bag is good."
4,Good for my camera storage needs.,"This gadget bag has been perfect for holding my Canon Rebel T3 and all the accessories I have for it. The camera fits snugly into the left side of the bag's interior, and there are thick walls inside to keep it from moving or becoming damaged. There are also slots for additional lenses. There are front and side pockets, providing even more storage for batteries, filters, and more. The padded shoulder strap makes carrying the bag a breeze.The only complaint I have about this bag is the closure. The buckles are very hard to open, and it takes a few seconds for me to get to my camera. It'd be nice it zipped rather than buckling. Still, it's a solid camera bag with lots of space and padding."
5,sturdy,an absolute necessity for a photography student! compartments for the camera and lenses and anything else that may be required. Lightweight and sturdy.
5,Handy but not bulky,"Well designed and well padded. This bag will not hold a full load of gear but it will hold a camera with a lense then I carry a flash unit, battery packs, and chargers for both. I could add a smaller fixed or zoom lense to the bag, but if you are adding a bigger zoom or fixed lense (70-200 or more) you would really have a tight squeeze.The strap is long enough to fit across you body and ride on your shoulder with ease. Makes carring the bag effortless even on a long distance hike."
5,Feels solid and it fits all my gear.,"I can fit a Rebel body, a 50 1.4, 85 1.8, 24-135 3.5-5.6, a 430EX II and still have room for a few small things (though one of the lenses is mounted to the T3i) like a diffuser, some USB chargers for my phone and memory cards in the main storage area. You have three decent sized pockets in addition to that where you can fit cleaning kits and other small items.It's not a huge bag, don't expect it to fit any more than Just about what I listed, either. It'll fit a reasonable amount of gear, but unless you're like me, not all of it. Good price, good quality, good buy."
4,"Great product, very handy for SLR cameras","I really loved this bag, has lot of space and can accomodate lot of extra stuff in there too. Highly recommended !!!!"
5,Great Bag,"Bought this bag for my sister for her Canon Rebel. She tells me it works perfectly and fits her camera, lens, and accessories. very pleased"
4,well made with an error,"The camera case is really nice, just the right size. the only problem is there is an inside pocket and it has a zipper with no end so there is no way to open the pocket."
5,Nice camera bag!,"Nice camera bag for a great price. You can adjust the inside to be fitting for your lens' and have room for you camera as well. Plenty of pockets for accessories. Would recommend this purchase for any amateur photographer, most likely too small for most professionals out there."
5,grea!t,It was sent to me in great condition and I use it to put my camera and lens in. Great carrier bag for my canon.
5,Canon 2400 bag,"Bag is built sturdy. Spacious enough to fit my T3i with 18-135mm lens attached. My 50mm f1.4, hoods, filter lens, battery charger, extra batteries and manuals. Very satisfied.Canon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras"
5,Everything I expected!,"The Gadget Bag, is original and very big. It has like everything I wanted!! fast shipping and new! for a great price."
5,EOS gadbet bag,"It is a beautiful bag. I just did not read the discription fully. It is much too big for my needs. I am keeping it and as I add new lenses and a new flash attachment, it will come in handy."
4,Good bag,"Enough room to hold all stuff, camera and lenses and other things. But not easy to carry around because the bag is too ""wide"". Will consider backpack next time."
4,good and robuste,"I put insid my Rebel XTi , my flash and my videocamera with all the relative stuff and they fit perfectly"
3,returned it,"Returned it in favor of a much nicer, much lower key, Crumpler bag. Check out the ""5 Million Dollar Home"" before you buy this. Its worth it."
5,Great camera bag,"I am very pleased with this bag. It is a perfect fit for my Canon Rebel XTI camera and two additional lenses. There is plenty of room for other things, plus lot of compartments and zippered side compartments for accessories. Very well made and padded. I am fully satisfied with this purchase."
2,small,"if this holds a body and 3-5 lens they must be very small!!! Maybe they meant filters. Best I could do was 60D body + 18-200 lens +16-55 2.8L + flash (430)would NOT hold any of my larger L series glass. Might keep it, but gonna try and find a larger one. I tried to send it back but this vendor DOES NOT PAY RETURN SHIPPING. BE CAREFUL, so for the $20 difference after return shipping I decided to keep it, maybe one of the kids can use it."
5,Fits Anything Reasonable!,"This camera bag will not hold 20 lenses, a tripod, and your sandwich. Personally, I say ""Thank God for that!"". What it does do is a great job of holding three lenses along with your camera and some small extras. There are plenty of pockets for lens cleaners, etc., while the bag is still very well padded.I have found you can even stuff more than three lenses into the bag (yes, along with the camera, etc.), but at the penalty of double stacking some of your smaller lenses. If you spent your life's fortune on lenses then I certainly wouldn't recommend doing so, but if you're in a pinch and have some less expensive lenses you can shove together, why not? It fits them quite comfortably.This would be a hard camera bag to beat. Holds everything and is well padded."
3,Great value but smaller than expected.,"I purchased this bag for my Canon digital rebel XT. It's durable and well built. Some what smaller than advertised but I'm sure it's ideal under most circumstances. Perfect if you have a camera body and single lens. However, I returned it in exchange for the Canon 200DG bag which is larger and could accommodate up to 3 lens, camera body and accessories easily. The 2400SLR bag has plastic latches, rings and zippers. The Canon 200DG has heavy metal latches and is constructed with thicker padding and heavy duty zipper and pouches. The price of the 2400SLR is very reasonable and a great value for the money. But, if you are planning to carry a camera body and 2 or more lens, I would not recommend this bag."
4,"Great Camera Bag, best value around!","When I was looking for a camera/gear bag, I first checked the usual suspects: Lowepro, Tamrac, etc. They had the product I was looking for; however, at a price that was out of my budget. I then decided to check our Canon's. To my surprise and delight they had exactly what I was looking for: something semi-hard, protective, weather-proof and within my tight budget. I ended up deciding for getting couple of these guys and am nothing but satisfied. This bag is spacious and exactly as advertised.If has configurable inner dividers so you can customize how it fits your precious equipment. Very easy te get things in and out of, and it can pack a lot! I usually carry my camera with a 28-135 lens attached, two other lenses, batteries, a few filters, couple of lense's hoods and a few memory cards. It all fits and everyting stays in place. In short, a superb value. If you're looking for an inexpensive camera/gear bag, this is the one to get!"
4,I would recommend this Bag,"I ordered this gadget bag to be used with a camera given for Christmas, and it has worked out very well."
5,love it,"Perfect item. I got this for my canon 60D camera. The space within it is flexible, you can make your own decision about how you want it to be."
3,Bigger than expected....,"I did not want a big bag. Many of the reviews complained that this bag was somewhat small, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I contemplated the dimensions (which I should note are actually about 14""wide x 7.5""deep x 8.5"" high. That's 3"" wider than the description indicates) and thought it would be right for me. I wanted to be able to store my camera body, two lenses, and the charging equipment in the bag. It is waaaayy too much bag for just that. The bag itself is almost the size of my diaper bag. It's so big, I would never carry another bag with this one. It's nice, but it's probably going back."
3,Not bad,"Though it's a little clunky and cumbersome, since it was a little bigger than expected, it's not bad. It's great for whatever you need to bring along with you, and has a lot of compartments. Only real gripe is that the strap squeaks a lot."
4,"Great bag, a little hard to get into easily","This bag has proven to be very durable for me; the construction is solid. What I don't like about it is probably a feature, not a bug -- the closing strap prongs snap REALLY WELL in to the receiver. This means that if you're trying to fish your camera out of the case for a shot, you better be filming something standing still, because you can't just flip the bag open with ease unless it's already open.There is enough storage capacity for one camera and 2-3 medium-sized lenses, with several filters able to be included in the various pouches. If you're using a larger lens, it may not fit in this bag with the camera at all, though if you play with the variable, adjustible velcro side panels inside the main compartment, you can get a surprising number of useful configurations.The padding is very nice inside the bag; I feel my camera is safe inside for travel."
5,Great bag to carry your camera with its accessories,Great bag for carrying all your camera stuff. It may feel a bit bulky if you are carrying only the camera. Quality is great. The compartments provided in it can be adjusted as required. It is great to have this if you are traveling a lot. However its too bulky to carry it around your neck.
3,Just a camera bag with the Canon logo,It's a decent bag but nothing more than that. It is not designed to custom fit an EOS SLR camera as the advertisement leads one to believe and does not have much more space to fit more than the camera and only one lens. I'd read this in a previous review and should have paid more attention before purchasing.
4,not big enough,"Everything is excellent about this Canon camera case except that does not hold the equipment as described. I use a Canon XT2i with the kit lens, a 20-200mm f4 L lens,a lens hood for the zoom, the battery charger, several filters, a tripod mount bracket, a strobe, batteries and several manuals - it does not all fit with the dividers in place and barely fits without the dividers. The zoom (my primary lens) must be detached from the camera body before placing it in the bag. Go for the larger Canon bag!!!"
5,Best camera bag I ever had,I have had this bag for 4 years now and its still strong and sturdy and amazing. I love it and recommend it to any canon lover
4,It's a good bag and a large bit,"Bag is good for numerous lenses, etc. For just the camera the bag is to big. Would consider smaller bag in the future."
5,This bag is great!!,This item was purchased for a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It is large enough to hold the Canon Rebel and the extra lens and other accessories. It is well made with thick padding that should protect the camera and be easy to carry while travelling. I would highly recommend this bag. I received this item quickly from Amazon. I love doing business with Amazon!!!
4,"nice bag, but more than i needed","The bag itself is nice, plenty of pockets, room for EVERYTHING my new T2i had included with it, and it's all snug and protected. But then, there's plenty of room left over.... it's much bigger than I expected it to be. I guess it is something to work toward: having enough gear to fill this thing. For now though, it just feels like overkill."
4,Great bag!,This bag was great. I have a Canon EOS camera and it fit perfectly along with all the extra components that I have. The bag is sectioned with an adjustible panel which makes it nice to be able to personalize it to what you need. The manuel fit in the front pocket for easy access. The bag is padded and the strap is long and comfortable to carry on the shoulder.
4,Great Quality,"Great quality camera bag. A little smaller than I thought. It didn't fit all my accessories, but I'm happy with it."
3,Camera bag,"This bag is ok. It is not as big as I had thought, but is adequate. It will not carry a camera and three lenses as shown, and the plastic hooks are a pain to connect. The bag though, is surprisingly light and easy to carry. IF you have more than a camera and lense to carry, I would recommend a larger bag."
5,Great Bag - Great price,"I have bought two of these bags because they are so useful for carrying my equipment. The padded separator panels are great. You can adjust them to fit any configuration of equipment you may have. It has all kind of storage for manuals and extra batteries and all of the accessories that go with my camera set-up. I love the adjustable shoulder strap with the no-slip padded carry mat in the center. It's real convenient to carry my tripods in the exterior, bottom stow-away straps. When I ran out of space in my first bag, I bought another. You can't go wrong with this item."
4,Just Right for Me,"I can fit my 40D, three lenses (one mounted), extra battery, AC adapter and cords in this bag, with room to spare for filters, the user's manual, and other small items in the outside pockets. I put the camera with one mounted lens on one end, face down, supported by the hinged cushioned dividers. There's room outside these dividers (between which the mounted lens belongs) for the lens caps and extra battery. My two unmounted lenses fit vertically along one side of the remaining space, leaving the other half for adapter and cords -- and as a temporary space for switching lenses. There's a flat pocket at the front of the bag that's perfect for the user's manual and any other flat item such as lens papers. That still leaves the two box-shaped pockets on either side. And it's all very snug."
4,Nice bag.,"It has very nice pockets and stuff, a little big, nice compartments, and definitely worth the price. Very awesome bag. I just don't like the fact that it says Canon on it and draws attention to what you're carrying -- it's tough on the streets, cuz."
5,EXACTLY what I needed,"Between the price, the size, the style and my need - this item fulfilled every specification I required for a new camera bag. It turned out to be EXACTLY what was described. It got to my home in about a week - timely."
1,Wasn't what the picture showed,"In bottom of descrioption it was stated that the item was different than picture, I felt mislead from the picture and it's description. Vendor would not take it back"
5,Great for storage for my dslr canon,It fits all my lens for my camera. Great for storage and very useful. It's easy for traveling and have different departments for all the accessories.
4,Decent bag,"I bought this bag mostly as a starter bag, realizing that as I bought more lenses that I would have to find something else. It's nice that the interior has movable dividers, but because of the sizes that it comes with, your options are limited.This bag is fine, but I think I'll want to actually look at bags in person for the next one I buy."
5,Good Camera Bag,"First off, this review is from the perspective of a family that has a DSLR to capture family moments. We have a Rebel T2i that we usually use with a 18-135 mm lens.The Camera fits perfectly with the lens still attached in the slot meant for the camera. There is still plenty of room around the camera and the lens to allow for the ""air cushion"" you really want around the device, so it isn't directly touching the sides too much in case of blunt damage.The size is really impressive! I thought it would be a little bit smaller, but the bag is the perfect size for a few lenses, air blaster, memory cards, and plenty of lens filters. The Saddle bags on the side are great, and I really liked the layout of everything.The bag is sturdy and very well secured. Straps are adjustable on the front, as is the shoulder strap, which allows for some adjustments to make sure it is comfortable and nothing will be falling out."
5,great bag,"great protection and customizable. only problem I have is im running out of room but thats my fault, I keep buying stuff. right now I have my rebel xs with the 28mm 1.8 lens with tulip hood attached. 18-55 kit lens. 55-250 lens and a cannon vixia camcorder in the main part. flash, chargers, cables, cloths, lens filters and an extra hood in the other compartments."
4,Bag,It did everything that it was supposed to do. The only thing i didnt like was the zipper. I probably would not purchase it again. Fast shipping
4,Exactly what is says it is.,"This camera bag is very small. I am one of those people who has a lot of camera equipment and this bag is only good for holding my cords, batteries, filters, and perhaps one camera body if I am lucky. For the casual photographer this bag is good for a camera body and maybe two lenses and a flash. Perhaps an air blower for dust as well. But if you expect to be adding to your camera selection in a future, I would suggest getting a bigger bag. And one preferably with better weather sealing. This bag has next to none."
5,CAMERA BAG,GREAT BAG. I BOUGHT A GOOD CAMERA BUY THE BAG THAT CAME WITH IT WAS NOT GREAT. lOVE THIS BAG
5,Great Bag!,"This bag was more than I bargined for! Not only is it roomy enough for my Canon Camera, I'm able to fit my video camera and accessories in it too. Great for traveling...one less bag to carry."
5,So far so good...,"Gadget Bag has been great so far. Plenty of room for 3 lenses and 1 camera body plus nice size side pockets. Bag seems rugged, but haven't used it too much yet."
3,"Good quality, but too small","This is a nicely-made camera bag, but nowhere near big enough for most of us. It will hold ONE camera body, ONE lens, but probably not a flash attachment or battery grip. If all you have is a camera body and one lens, with very few accessories, this bag would be OK, but as soon as you start adding on to your system, you will need a bigger bag. Limited usefulness."
3,cannon case,Unfortunately this case is way to small for my new 7d and lenses. The case itself seems to be nice for a smaller set up.
3,Canon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras,"Light weight, sturdy nylon fabric, well constructed, rather small interior space though. I keep my camera in its own case and use the gadget bag for all my accessories and it works well for me.Canon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras"
4,Canon Gadget BAg,"I recently used this on a trip and it held all of my equipment, plus serving as a purse so I only had to carry one bag. It is lightweight and the interior space is adjustable to fit your own camera and gadgets. I think it is a very good value."
4,Pretty cheap insurance for your SLR,"When I bought this it was mainly for the price and the description compared with other bags available, but after buying it I discovered that it was not quite what I had expected. The dividers that are shown in the pictures on the listings are not as heavy duty as they look and they are not permanently attached to the bag, they attach with velcro strips. I was a little hesitant about putting a $900 camera in it until I started placing things in the bag and arranging the dividers. At that point I realized that this had been a good purchase after all. You can set it up to keep each lens separate from the others as well as keeping the camera body in it's own space, and you have extra pockets and space to carry a wide variety of accessories for your camera separate from everything else. It really is a very cheap way to ensure the safe transportation of expensive DSLR cameras,lenses, and accessories in a way that protects them from each other and from outside damage."
5,Handles a lot of Gear,"I got this a month ago and I am amazed at how much equipment it can hold. I have my Canon 60D Body, a Tamron 17-50mm lens, a 55-250mm Canon, a 18-135mm Canon and my 50mm lens. I also have battery charger and 2 battery's in one of the side pocket and numerous other little gadgets in other pockets. Quite a remarkable bag and it looks good, also."
5,Great organizer,This camera bag met all my needs with room to spare. But it's not too big. It arrived quicker than expected and packed well. Good purchase at a great price. It will be useful to me for many years to come.
3,"Nice Roomy Bag, Be Careful of Clasps",The bag was very nice and roomy. It held my new Canon EOS Rebel T3i and accessories beautifully. The only complaint that I have is that you can pinch your fingers in the plastic clasps if you are not careful. I would have probably chosen a different bag if I had known better....
5,Great for the Money,"I couldn't be more pleased! Great for the money. Until I get another lens for my camera, I'm even able to fit my sony video camera, disks, cords, chargers, etc in with all my camera gear. Some might claim it's a bit big; however, I could care less...I needed something that would protect my investment and this has done a fantastic job thus far. I personally don't feel it's that big. It's padded very well also."
3,"Nice bag, but no zipper on top","This is a well made, large camera bag. There is plenty of room for my Rebel XI, the 18-55 mm lens, and all the cords, manuals, etc. that came with the camera. Now to the gripe: The main compartment lid is secured by two push clasps. Very sturdy, but it needs a zipper in my view. When the bag is loaded and on my shoulder the bag flexes to reveal a gap between the lid the the main part of the bag. The means my gear is exposed to the elements more than I would want (or expect in a camera bag) and little stuff might fall out (not likely, though)."
4,"Good bag, but wish it slightly bigger","The description of the capacity is fairly accurate. I can tightly fit in one Digital Rebel+18-55 zoom, one 50-200 zoom, one 10-22 zoom, one 50 prime, and one flash. The camera body barely fits the space. Overall, it is a good bag, but I wish that it is slightly bigger to get things in and out more easily."
1,"Canon USA says ""no warranty on bags"", cheap and disposable.",My Canon camera bag's zipper broke and I called Canon USA to get it fixed. The service rep told me that Canon camera bags have no warranty at all.This is a cheap disposable bag that worked well for a few months and I'll miss it. The replacement will be a higher quality bag from someone other than Canon.
1,Amazon Falsly Advertises,"I purchase this bag from Amazon based on their description and what others had said about the bag. To my disappointment, the bag was much smaller than advertised and in fact the tag on the bag stated the dimensions of 9.5 x 7 x 6 inches which is vastly different from the 11 by 8.7 by 7.9 inches (width x height x depth) advertised by Amazon or should I say as stated by the company that Amazon represents. Regardless, it is Amazon's site that presents this bag's incorrectly stated dimensions and after returning the bag for this reason (which Amazon took care of professionaly) and after pointing out to them in an email that they have not changed their site to reflect this fact, they continue to falsly advertise this item. I in fact stated to them that to make a mistake is okay, but to continue to do so false advertising. After six months they are still do so. I would be curious to see if this review makes it to their site.Steve"
4,Good Delivery Time,"i liked the product quality and delivery time of this item. It worth of the price, the only problem you can face sometimes is the big size of it but if you love your camera and photography it won't bother you"
4,Nice bag,"Not overly big, but holds camera, two lenses, battery charger & a couple other small items well without carrying a suitcase around your neck."
3,I expected more,I expected the bag to fit more gear than it does. The lack of zipper for the main compartment is frustrating. Now it just sits in my closet because i bought the Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras which is a great buy. It is bigger and easier to carry.
2,Too Small,"The bag itself is nice enough...well made and feels sturdy. However, it is way too small for anything but the basics. With my Canon 60D with its EFS 18-135mm lense attached, there is only enough room for the flash and one extra battery. The front pocket is nothing more than a flap with no depth at all. Anything thicker than memory cards or cables won't fit here. I have other cameras and accessories with no place to store them. I will need to replace this bag."
5,Protects well,"Good bag, holds the supplies I have at this point and is nice to tote a tripod on it's bottom straps. Very useful and feels solid for protecting your camera."
5,Awesome the whole way around!,This bag can hold absolutely anything. Its rugged design is awesome for my outdoor photography. The shoulder strap is very comfortable. The only downside I've found yet is that the tripod holding straps dangle all of the time.
5,Canon SLR Bag for EOS Cameras,"This item arrived within 4 days of ordering it. I had no idea how much space it provided and I was very impressed with the quality and different storage compartments. The quality exceded my expectations given the low sales price. Every once in a while you get MORE than you pay for, instead of less, and this was one of those occasions."
4,great bag for the price!,"I'm just a casual photographer, but I do have a lot of gadgets and lenses for my camera. It is big enough for 2 big lenses, the body, a flash, the battery charger, all the wires and plug-ins that I use, and I can attach my tripod on the outside. It's good quality, and the only thing I would change is the closure. It only has the two buckles in the front to close it, so dust etc. could get in easily. But the inside is very padded and nice with lots of zipper areas and compartments."
5,Great Bag,Order came fast and condition was as promised. Has plenty of space for extras that a photographer will need when using a Canon SLR camera.
3,Bag is bigger than it appears in picture. Excellent quality.,"Quality of the bag is excellent. Actual bag is bigger in size than it appears in picture. That is because it has lot of depth in it. The depth is like you can put a lens vertically on top of another lens. So, it is definitely not for personal use but for professional purpose who carry multiple lenses, batteries or even cameras.I should stress on a point that the quality of the bag is excellent."
3,"Solid storage and overall decent bag, but has issues.","I purchased this bag to house a new Canon DSLR and am generally pleased. The amount of storage is great, allowing for the camera body, two lenses, an additional pocket camera, a GorillaPod, two battery chargers, various cords and other small cleaning supplies. My major beef with this case, however, is the closure or top to the bag. When carrying this on your shoulder, the straps pull awkwardly toward the center top creating a gap between the top and sides of the bag. This gap easily lets in rain, dirt, you name it. Even with the straps pulled as tight as possible, the gap remains. I imagine, if you didn't have all of this basic equipment in the bag (what I've filled the bag with is definitely within the parameters of reason), you wouldn't have this issue."
5,great canon bag,this canon camera bag is very very good.. the internal of the bag can be reconfigured to fit your camera body and lenses..!material is also great. well worth the money... I did not expect i can get such a good bag for this price..
3,Roomy but clunky ...,"We store our Rebel DSLR with manuals and cleaning accessories and have plenty of room for a lens in the future. However, the bag is clunky and not so ideal for going out and about. The clasps can be annoying for those times when you have to open your bag quickly or frequently. Velcro under the top would have been a nice feature. We would've also liked to see better quality material. (We love our Crumpler bag -- it has velcro and is of high-quality.)"
4,Nearly perfect for the EOS camera.,"Pockets for nearly all things necessary for a photographic session. Holds a spare lens snugly and a lens attached to the body as well, spare film, batteries, manuals, and room for a little more. Bag seems to be well-constructed also, with thick padding and secure strap & handle. Would buy it again."
5,Excellent product,"It was exactly what I expected. It accommodated a Cannon Rebel Digital camera,a zoom lense and wide angle lense, as well as a small tripod andmini camera and camcoder. I would recomend this product ."
5,Canon SLR Bag,"This bag has plenty of interior space for several lenses. The moveable dividers allows you to arrange the interior space to suit your needs. 3 Roomy exterior pockets with zipper closures are great for lens covers,filters,etc. The interior lid has a mesh zippered pocket to hold that lens cover I always misplace when snapping photos. Great bag, great value!"
4,"This is a fine bag, bought for the camera, because I dropped the camera and ran up $200 in repairs",I needed something to carry the bag and it's odds and ends. I bought the bag and it does the job.
5,Great Bag - holds everything!!,"We love this camera bag! I love that it has sections, that make everything fit nice and organized!! We have and SLR camera, 2 lenses, 1 point-and-shoot camera, and a camcorder all in there with the cords! I only wish it had a longer strap (to wear over the shoulder)."
3,Muy grande para mi,"La maleta para la camara esta muy bonita, el espacio que tiene y las bolsas aditionales se ven muy buenas. Desafortunadamente no es el producto para mi. Compra esta funda solamente si eres profesional y necesitas dos camaras y mas lentes. La funda es demasiado grande para un amateur. Es muy muy grande e incomoda para poder viajar, Yo la llamaria una mini maleta. Si eres fotografo profesional, comprala. Pero si solo quieres proteger tu camara con una funda comoda y llevarla a tus viajes y aventuras, es a NO! No la compres.De hecho la regrese y Amazon inmediatamente nos mando el return slip y nos dio el refund. Amazon was Great!"
2,Good bag but way too big...too big to carry everyday,"Got this bag free with purchase of T4i Canon and thought it would match. It has plenty of space inside and can hold everything. However, the bag is huge, so big I can fit my DSLR, Camcorder and even a point and shoot camera. It is not something I would carry everyday and now have to buy a smaller carrying case to compensate for this golf bag sized camera bag. I like the bag but it is just not feasible to carry daily."
5,Great bag for the money.,"I purchased this bag shortly after buying my Rebel XTi, and have been very pleased with it. I currently have the XTi body, two lenses, a point-and-shoot camera, a camcorder, 2 battery chargers, and several blank mini-DVDs stored in this bag, with room to spare. I haven't come across ANY bag similar in size or quality that is anywhere near as affordable as this one. Highly recommended!"
2,Canon SLR Gadget Bag review,"The bag is fine and can hold one SLR body, two lens and other accessories. The price is good if you buy from amazon."
3,Bulky,"By all means, it's a great bag. Seems very well built, sturdy, super nice... but it's so BIG. :( I'm an amateur photographer and I bought this since it seemed really reasonable but it's so large that I feel very conspicuous carrying it anywhere out of my room."
3,So So,"This is not too elegant, good for moving around your camera and other stuff but a bit too loose."
2,Excellent Bag,"I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro."
5,LOVE IT! and CHEAP!,"For an official Canon Camera Bag it is cheap! $30 and you get the best camera bag for dslrs.It came fast and packaged nicely. The quality is great and the shoulder straps and zippers all work very well.There are multiple dividers within the bag and they work excellent. You can fit 3 or prob max 4 lens and a dslr camera in the bag. The pouches on left, right, and front are spacious and perfect for all your camera gears (sd card, mini tripod, batteries, chords, etc.) There is also a zipper pouch on underneath the top of the bag which is useful.I recommend this product highly, you can't go wrong with a high quality bag like this."
4,Not bad for the price,"Luckily you can adjust the dividers [Velcro.] I wanted to be able to store my camera with a lens attached. I have a feeling this may be some taboo no-no to professional photographers. Oh well. I can store my Canon t2i (With battery grip) with a 28-80mm lens attached, my 70-300m lens, my ""nifty"" 50mm, and Pro-Optic/Rokinon 8mm Fisheye, and intervalometer remote. Fitting all these lenses takes a lot of organization skills, but it's maxed out. I don't think 5 lenses will fit..Also, it has pockets for my filter sets.Bottom line: This is a good bag if you want to minimally carry your camera and a couple favorite lenses. If you want anything more serious than this, you should consider a backpack."
4,Canon 2400 Bag,"Fantastic bag fit all my components and lenses with room for future growth! I like how the camera can facing down with a lense still attached to the body, and there is plenty of room for at least three more lenses and accesories.Great bag arrived quick and in good condition!"
4,Great bag!,"I purchased this to store my Canon DSLR and a couple lenses that I own. It does the job great, and it very sturdy and durable. Cons are it IS heavy, BUT for what it is, and what it does- that is to be expected."
5,GREAT size,"I've recently outgrown my small cross body bag, as well as I've been having some carrying issues w/ the cross body. I just became one of the photographers for my student newspaper and so I now have to carry my camera w/ me at pretty much all times, but I still have to carry my backpack. So the cross body bag and my backpack don't exactly mix. So I found this bag for under $40, liked what I saw, and really liked that it was from Canon, which my equipment mostly is. It don't think it's as big as I expected, I expected just a small bit bigger, but this still does the job. I'm anxious to see how my 3rd lens will fit in w/ my small telephoto, camera, and fisheye adapter."
4,Great Camera Bag,This bag was larger than I thought. But it wasn't too overly large. It has side pockets as well as a large roomy front pocket. The inside dividers are Velcro to make customization easy.The padding is thick on the inside.I placed my Canon T3 so that it lays flat with the bottom of the bag. This still gave me room to put an additional lens or flash.
4,Excellent quality and protection for camera but a little too large,"I got it for free during black friday 2012.Quality is really good and obviously fits nicely the camera, the extra lenses, batteries and even manual.However it is a little to big to travel around with it."
4,Great Product,"This is a great product for the price. It could use just a tiny bit more room, but Im very pleased with it!"
3,So So Product,"Very big, Does not have a zipper for the main cover. The quality is so-so. Not very satisfied withi this product. It's just OK. One thing is that it is big enough for 1 camera and 4 lens. Lots of small pockets too for other stuff."
2,Not a good bag,I would NOT suggest this bag if you have more than one lens. Camera will not fit if you keep a 55-250 MM lens on it. I would recommend the 200D over this bag or the Canon gadget bag. BEWARE!
5,Nice travel bag,"I own one of the Canon backpacksCanon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras, which served as my main bag until I purchased this gadget bag. The bag holds my kit lens, 75-300, 28-75mm f/2.8, my 50mm f/1.8, and my XT w/ battery grip. Side pockets are perfect for my G-rocket and spare memory cards and batteries. If I leave my 28-75mm lens attached to the body, there's also enough room for my 430EX. Straps below for tripod/monopod are a nice thought and work well with my Bogen monopod, although I don't know how well they'd handle the weight of my Bogen tripod.All in all, perfect bag for minor outtings and assignments. Strap is long enough to leave on your shoulder while you swap lenses and dig through the bag. I still use the 200EG bag for major trips, but for the everyday ventures this bag is everything I need. If space was an issue, this bag can certainly fit enough for me to get by if I can't bring the larger bag."
4,BBQ Grill Pad,"The pad has the texture of a popcorn ceiling, they say it is easy to clean but I have not had to clean it yet. Maybe if I use a hose or broom it would clean ok, but it is not a pad you can just wipe off. I wish it was a little bigger, it fits under my grill but not much stick out to catch splatters. But I think it works ok, if I had to buy another I would buy it again."
1,"Didn't fit, slightly cheesy","Too short, waist band was poorly constructed and looked it, amazon returned my money but charged me for shipping claiming the error was mine. I disagree--the size I purchased fits in many other brands."
2,NOT Karcher hose,"Karcher 50-Foot Extension/Replacement HoseThis hose is NOT made by Karcher as implied in the ad. It did NOT fit the quick-connect ends on my new Karcher G-3025BH, even with the adapter. It DOES seem like a better hose than the 25 foot Karcher hose that came with the pressure washer. I am going to take the 2 hoses to the hardware store to see if they can make them work. My time, my gas....maybe the company that is implying that this non-Karcher hose fits Karcher stuff will pay for my parts at the hardware store? Naaaaa! It is not good business to deceive customers!"
3,Product description issues,"The hose probably does not take the pressure described (which is extremely high) but probably 2500. Also the picture shows 1 male and 1 female end whereas the product may come with 2 female ends and one adaptor. See customer review written on the 25 foot hose/extension. As pictured, the hose is only an extension, not a replacement hose as a replacement hose needs two male ends."
3,Also not karcher hose and wrong adaptor,This is not a Karcher hose and the adaptor should be a male/male one. They sent a female/male adaptor which is useless. Do not purchase unless you are okay with those two things.
1,Disappointed - Karcher 50 ft extention/replacement hose,"What can I say. I ordered a new Karcher 5.85 electric pressure washer and this hose. I was going to replace the 25 ft hose with this 50 ft one. The hose was that powdery black rubber that comes off in your hands. And it didn't fit on this particular model, so it was a complete bust and waste of money. Even had it fitted, because of the quality I'm not sure I would have used it. Very disappointed."
5,Karcher Pressure Washer 50 ft Extension,"I rated the hose 5 star but follow-up service I would have to rate it1 star. Wrote several E-mails in concern with the adapter. I ask several time if the 50 ft extension came with the adapter ... no answer or reply. I am still wondering if it should have came with one or not. My box had the 50 ft hose, but no adapter ... and no response."
3,Doesn't live up to Scarry's other titles,"Richard Scarry is one of my child's favorite authors, and was a favorite of mine when I was a child as well. However, this book does not reach the level of quality found in many of his other titles. When I ordered this book, I was unaware that it was an adaptation of a cartoon series, rather than an original Scarry story book. While it still surpasses many other children's books in entertainment value, the illustrations and stories are not as charming as I have come to expect. Finally, for children who are Lowly Worm fans, be forewarned that Lowly does not appear in this book at all. My son was dissapointed that he could not search for Lowly Worm on each page, as he so enjoys doing in books like Richard Scarry's Busytown."
1,Absolutely agree with the first reviewer,"You may think a Richard Scarry book is simply written, but these ""adapted"" books are a disgrace to the original author's flair for the written word. I wish the publishers would be truthful about who is paid to author these wimpy adaptations. Bring back the ORIGINAL books and burn these imitators!!"
4,Baseball for Beginners,"While it says it is for Dummies, I think it might be more accurate to say it is for new players. I wish I had read it 60 years ago. I coulda been a contender. Anyway, I enjoyed it and have passed it on to my grandson who is at an age where it will be a good resource (his Dad is a coach and I suspect will also be reading it)."
1,Not nearly as good as most Dummies books,"I was very disappointed in this book. Usually Dummies books give a great overview of a particular topic (Football for Dummies is excellent). As other reviewers have said, this book leaves out the basics of the game. Instead it gives specific details for playing the game such as how to place your feet when preparing to steal a base. However, it does not give any detail of what situations base stealing is used, what the pitcher and rest of the defense do to prevent it, how the manager gives direction to the runner to steal through the use of signs, etc. I expect Dummies books to cover the basics and explain things in easy to follow terms. This book does neither.I guess if you're looking for a how-to-play-baseball book this has a few decent tips, but if you're a novice fan (dummy)hoping to gain insight into the workings of the game, this isn't the book for you."
2,Too much of too little,"As stated by others, this tries to be everything to everybody, and as a result I think few are satisfied.I wanted information to appreciate the game as a fan - in addition to a good discussion of rules, I really wanted to understand tactics and strategy so that I can understand some of the subtleties going on on the field. The discussion of rules is decent (starting with the most basic - like which direction to run around the bases), but it still misses some rules altogether.Too much of the book is spent instructing the reader how to play each position, or how to organize a team - nothing wrong with that, but it's a different book altogether."
2,jargons to explain jargons,"I had high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews. At the same time, my baseball knowledge is very limited. My biggest disappointment is that the author tried to explain baseball jargons using baseball jargons. In other words, the ideas are not explained in plain, effective language. Maybe the author is ""born"" to speak the language of baseball. Unfortunately for readers like myself who is trying hard to know more about the sport, the baseball jargon does not come naturally."
2,Not really for dummies.,"Joe Morgan is probably one of the more astute baseball minds there is today. For the true baseball fan, his analysis is usually right on the mark and insightful. However, he does not translate well into ""...for Dummies"" book. I purchased the book for a friend, hoping it would provide a basic understanding. But Morgan gets too in-depth too quickly. The level of explanation is too high for the non-fan (the ""dummy"") and too low for a true fan."
5,Home Run,Joe Morgan is a genius great book for anyone who want to learn the game of baseball a truly great sport good reference book good easy directions to follow.
3,"Too much, too little.","An excellent book, but badly focused. It really needs to be split into 'Playing Baseball for Dummies' and 'Watching Baseball for Dummies'."
3,What is the target audience for this book?,"Baseball for Dummies covers many different subjects, from great players to practice drills to how to set up a league. It may range over too many subjects - the beginning fan doesn't need to know about practice drills, and a Little Leaguer doesn't need to know about the great players. I think this book is better for novice players than for novice fans."
4,Among the better solar lights,"Very bright and lasts an easy 10 hours in summer. The 20' wires were a little short for my needs. Easy to add a little. Fits on 3/4"" copper tubing if you need more height."
3,A welcome blast from the past,"I waited a long time for this release & I was fairly well satisfied. For those fans of Nektar I would strongly recommend this CD. The musicianship & frenetic energy is still there. What is not there is quality production. Voices maddeningly fade in & out or are so far in the background you begin to wonder if this was a bootleg. Roye's voice is not what it once was. You can hear him holding back from those old high notes. There should have more auditions for their choice of back-up singers. Finally, I would have also wanted to see more band photographs.No matter. Nektar was one of my old college-day favorities. It was a pleasure listening to them again. ""Fidgety Queen"" alone was worth the price. Helluva show stopper!"
5,"A holistic, respectful, and playful focus on sense of self","As a mental health professional and former English teacher, I read Risking Intensity with particular interest in its holistic, respectful, and playful focus on sense of self as a foundation for teaching, writing, and being. Some emphasis must be given to the playful side of this book, as there is much humor and sensitivity to the ironies of human life. Distinctive features are author Michaels' artful inclusion of proven class activities and student work to illustrate the mind-body relationship in the creative process and her thoughtful guidance to teachers (readers) in understanding their own process as poets. Reading this book is an unfolding, organic process in itself, reflecting the content of the book and making it eminently re-readable."
3,informative,When trying to choose a retirement destination no one should relie on just one book.It was helpful in that it gave me an understanding of what I want and a idea of what I don't want.I will look at other books and videos before I have a clearer picture of what I desire.
1,Not What I expected..,"The Tax function as well as the other functions can be done by using the multiplication, addition, and subtraction functions. The examples seem to indicate this, The examples in instruction sheet can used with simple multiplication, addition, and subtraction problems? The Canon TS-10Ts calculator is Not What I expected... Also, the instruction sheet has errors: 4 errors under constant, and 1 error under percentage. To use Sell,Cost, and margin functions you need to know why these function, are needed. The examples doesn't help nor those instruction sheet. If you know you stuff use something better!!!"
4,good value for money,"My son has been growing like a weed over the last couple of months. He usually wears a size 10.5W in New Balance but they were getting a little snug. I ordered an 11 and they definatley run larger in size than his normal sneaker. He says they are really comfortable and insists he can run faster in them so to me they are a success. Same value for money compared to some of the other more expensive sneakers. They grow so fast, you want something of quality and for a great price and this sneaker is it."
5,its johnny time,this was one of the best DVDs i have ever bought for a great price. this has 39 episodes and are always funny and awesome buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!
5,my daughter loves it,This is a great find. my daughter loves it and so do I. because i no longer bave to go on the internet to look for specific episodes. they are all right here on this set.
3,"Sorry, but Salwa is no Umm Kalthum!","After the initial shock of hearing someone else singing, your ears will adjust... eventually. Many people tried to sing her songs, but there was only one Umm Kalthum and there'll never be another one like her! To Salwa's credit, I have to say that she tried hard... the voice is not bad but the pronunciation of the words leaves a lot to be desired. I also have to give her credit for staying away from parts of the songs where she knew she can't do it justice."
5,Jet Clean Solution,"This is the cleaning and lubricating solution that goes with Norelco shavers that are sold with the jet clean base. Between the base and the solution, the system works great. The shaver comes out factory clean, and the batteries are fully charged.Around where I live, it can be hard to find the solution. One would think that department stores which sell the shaver would sell the acessories, but many don't. I found the price here to be competative, and delivery was fast."
1,Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution,I hope it cleans!My new sytem didn`t work so i had to send back everything.I will add that i filled and emtyed it to send and i don`t like the opening of it or the filling hole of the cleaning system;too small and i spilled sole of it.Needless to say i spilled more trying to put it back to ship with the comeplete system.
1,BUY THIS ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE ACCOMPANYING UNIT,"This solution goes in the special cleaner charger unit that is sold with the model 9171 razor. Since this charger is not sold separately, I wasted my money buying it to accompany my model 9161 razor. It is not supposed to be used as a stand alone cleaning solution. You clean the 9161 by just popping the heads up and rinsing it under running water."
3,Jet Clean Solution,"While this product does clean the shaver very well, the shaver system requires you to change the solution every two weeks even if you haven't run the cleaning system very much. Having to replace the Jet Clean solution every two weeks makes the shaver very expensive over time. Also, this cleaning solution takes away any lubricating qualities of preshave liquids. I find that I have to rinse the shaver out after every cleaning in order to enable the shaver to glide smoothly over my face."
3,Jet Clean!!,"Don't know where the ""Jet"" comes in! It takes a long time to clean the razor, but the razor does come out feeling clean and new.I suppose this liquid is a scam and there is some cheaper solution available somewhere."
1,Couldn't use the solution,"I couldn't use the solution because I didn't have the SYSTEM to use it with. When I bought it there was nothing about having a system ( which costs well over $100)before it could be used, or at least it wasn't obvious enough to stop me from buying it. So, I think you got me on this one. I didn't send it back because it would have cost me more than just throwing it away. Unhappy with the deal.John Ashley"
3,Only If you want it,"this product is good for skating but really only necessary if u are scared to use something that doesn't have ""skate"" in the name fearing it will ruin your bearings...you can use pretty much any all purpose citrus based cleaner for a much bigger and cheaper bottle at your local super market and it will do exactly the same thing."
1,empty magazine article for a crazy price,"This is of no real value at all - it's not even of the quality that I'd expect from a free magazine - let alone one I'd pay for.It's a bright and cheerful article with a lively style but ultimately no substance at all. I will think a lot harder before buying one of these e-publications from amazon again.If only I'd read the other review.The art of innovation, on the other hand is great, and gives a much better perspective into what IDEO is about.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593352182/qid=1133341365/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-3003608-8076912?n=507846&s;=books&v;=glance"
1,Not worth it!,This article is too stekchy & not worth spending the money. You should save the money and buy the book - The art of innovation by Tom Kelley. Happy Reading!
4,The Trials And Tribulations Of Becoming A Swat Commander,This is a basic introduction to the decisions SWAT commanders face. It is short enough that all team leaders can and should read it.
2,WHY TITS??? WHY??,"I really like some albuns by TITS like Tudo ao mesmo tempo agora and TITANOMAQUIA...But what tits became in the late 90's makes me sad...They were a punk rock metal band and after the acoustic MTV they totally sell out their sound!!! Why, Tits??? WHY?"
2,The cure for Insomnia,"I had to read this book for school, and that is the only thing that kept me motivated to read it! It is informative, but extremely boring! I have read many text books and this is the second worst I have been forced to read, the worst is also by White, titled Advancing Family Theories. This man knows his stuff, but he can not write. The book outlines family theories in a way that makes a visit to the dentist look fun. He covers the subject he set out to do that is the only reason I gave him two stars. If you are a professor considering this book please reconsider, if you have any compassion for your students, however, if you are basically EVIL and want to make student suffer this is the book for you!"
2,this is a very comprehensive book - touch base with intl mkt,i had this book since june 1997 and it has been very helpful in answering any query and provide detailed explanation on the multinational and international perspect of finance.best regards
5,beautiful story and art work,"I loved the use of teddy bears to tell the story of christmas. The presentation of the bears, their beautiful costumes and the way the bears have been positioned in all the different scenes,and the excellent photography. This book is a feast for the eyes. Both children and adults with thoroughly enjoy this lovely story. And no doubt, will look for more from this author - Karen Schuler"
2,Leaning Tower of Fishes...,"I recieved this stand and pulled it out of the box and began to set it up. When I was finishd setting it up, the stand looked as though the tank could slide right off of it splattering water all over the place. It was leaning in several directions and lacked braces necessary to keep it from wobbling."
2,Fish tank stand,"Stand was not well made, was not built for 29 gallon tank, it was too large. Petco is selling a poorly made product,& not as shown"
1,Don't be a sucker,"If you have bought ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? The Complete 1st and 2nd Season"" and all 3 seasons of ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. ""Big Scare in the Big Easy"" and ""Lights! Camera! Mayhem!"" come from ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" and ""Jeepers, It's the Creeper"" is from the second season of ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"". So if you got any of the seasons don't buy this and if you don't buy them instead of wasting your money for 3 episodes, especially if you're a Scooby fan. Happy shopping."
5,Great Conclusion,"Fine conclusion to a very well-written and compelling fantasy story. First time I've read Douglas Nile, will definitely look for more of his work."
3,"Awful, limited, with prices in pounds not dollars","This book has a limited number of hotels, every restaurant and hotelprice is listed in pounds, which means you have to read it with your calculator in hand. Bummer!"
2,Missing Mel's Super Swell Dance Party!!!,"How in the world did Noggin miss the best show of them all, Mel's Super Swell Dance Party?! So unfortunate that they only put 4 of the first season on this DVD... at least add a second disk to the package. Hope they don't miss Jack Bunny on season two!"
5,Fabulous!,Great video! Entertaining for all ages (including grown-ups!) My son loves singing and dancing with the characters.
5,LOVE this DVD!,"My 14-month old LOVES to groove with Jack! We really like the episodes with the giant and the groundhog. I only wish there were more episodes on this DVD, or that there were different DVDs available to buy! We have several stored on our DVR, but it's nice to have the DVD to take to grandma's house! Our daughter asks for Jack by name and dances to the music. I think Jack's Big Music Show is a great program for toddlers with good messages, entertaining stories and great music!"
4,19 month old loves it!,"It is too bad this program was discontinued, as my daughter loves it. This DVD is perfect for travel with a little one, the episodes are just the perfect length to hold their attention."
4,"Good, but not enough singing","I like this DVD, but my daughter doesn't have much interest in it. It seems to not have captured the best of the songs from the show. It is still good, but I wish they would have had songs from the Dance Party episode which my daughter loved."
4,jacks big music show,An excellent way to introduce children and toddlers to the world of music and musical instruments. Good for adults too !
5,SON LOVES THIS!,"MY SON LOVES THIS SHOW - FOR ANY KID WHO LOVES MUSIC, THIS IS THE SHOW TO GET HIM OR HER."
4,Good but missing some of the best episodes.,This video is good but I really wish it had some shows on it that are not included. Jack's Big Music Show is a great tv show and I feel they did not choose the most entertaining shows for this video. My children like to watch the show on Noggin much more than this video.
4,Could use more episodes...,"My daughter (now 14 MO) LOVES this show. I DVR it for her, but I like to be able to take it in the car for our long car trips (an hour or more one way). Having it on DVD is great. She moves to the music and claps her hands in the carseat. I do wish they had a season pack or two out, though, instead of just these four episodes."
5,Jack is Great!,My 1 year old daughter loves Jack's Big Music show. And as parents we also really like the topics and songs on the show. We will not hesitate to buy any and all of Jack's Big Music Show items - it's just that they never release anything.
1,Horrible,"I bought Jack Music House for my six month old son because that is the only show he likes to watch. The video quality is horrible, the shows look like what a old TV is going bad because of a bad picture tube. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this for their child, or children because its a waste of money."
3,"Jack's Big Music Show ""Let's Rock"" review","Anything Jack's Big Music Show get's a 5 star rating in my book. My issue with this product is it is claiming to be ""season 1"" however when you receive the dvd it is only 4 episodes, 1 of which was just released in 2007. Episodes actually on the DVD are Ground Hog Day, Little Bad Wolf, Jack & the Bean Stock & How Mel Got His Groove Back.Season 1 actually consists of the following episodes:Little Bad WolfHow Mel Got His Groove BackThe Music GenieThe Bongo Bird Laurie BerknerMarching BandBug LoveMel's Super Swell Dance PartySpace OperaGrow DaddioThe Grumpy Squirrel Laurie BerknerKing of SwingMilkshakeSilly ShowSeasion 2 episodes:Snow DayLeonard the Country SquirrelSpunky the AlienJack BunnyPhil the Coo-Coo BirdJack's Big Oops!Jack's Big OrchestraScat CatGroundhog DaySuper Swell Sing-AlongComic Book HeroesMel's Bath DayJack and the Beanstalk"
2,"Good episodes, but...",You have to suffer through 5 solid minutes of promos for other Nick shows before you can get to the Title Menu. Simply unacceptable.
4,LOVE Jack's big music show,"This is a great DVD, my daughter (14 months) loves this show. However the DVD is only 4 or 5 episodes and there are more out there. Great price and defintely keeps her entertained - this worked perfectly on our recent airplane ride!"
3,Better Than Nothing,"My year old LOVES Jack and, like the other reviewers, we have most of the episodes on our DVR but we need something to travel with so I bought this on sale. I don't think I would ever pay full price for these 4 episodes. It would be, as Jack would say, Super Swell, if Nickelodeon would make ALL of the episodes available on DVD but this will do for now."
5,For all Jack's Big Music Show Fans.,"If you love Jack's Big Music Show, this is wonderful since it is 4 of Jack's Shows on one DVD. I only wish there were more DVD's with all the other Jack shows available for purchase. Our grandson loves Jack!!"
1,Leaking batteries,Found the batteries to be leaking and way past their expiry date. Disappointing buy - such basic quality issues wouldn't be expected of products sold on Amazon !
1,cheap filler item,"I needed a cheap filler item for supersaver shpping. I have a bunch of outlet covers, wire clamps, and coffee spoons and figured i'd use something else this time.Long story short, I think i'll stick with spoons and clamps. These batteries arent anything to write home about and mine appear to be AA cells with fiberboard wrapped around them to make a 'D' size.Go find something else to pad your cart with."
5,Very cute.,"My son(2 1/2) has a ton of these. We keep a handful in the diaper bag for when we are out to eat, he can roll them on the table quietly. He loves them. He plays with them all day long. They are great!"
5,My daughter LOVES these cars!,"When I first bought these cars, I thought they were much bigger than what they really are. However, my daughter loves these. She's had them for at least 6 months. She plays with them all the time STILL. Many toys she gets tired of, but these remain a favorite with her. She even has put them in the tub with her and they look good as new."
3,Not put together very well.,"I ordered this pan for Thanksgiving last year. It looks great, the accessories are of nice quality, and it actually managed to fit the 20-lb turkey that I was roasting... but when I went to pick up the pan to put it into the oven, I heard a loud CLANG and suddenly the right handle was in my hand, but wasn't attached to anything. I managed to catch the pan before the turkey went spilling out onto the floor, and was still able to roast the turkey without further incident, but I am disappointed that it didn't even make it through its first use without breaking. If you plan on using this for anything heavier than a few pounds, I would recommend looking for something a bit more heavy-duty."
3,So-so,"I wanted a pan where the handles were permanently up, not one where they fell down and lay against the sides of the pan because those pans are harder to grab when they are hot. Despite the picture showing the handles sticking out, they actually fall against the pan. I also wanted a flat, non-stick rack, which is what you get with this pan, but it's a very flimsy rack and might as well be a cooling rack. In fact, I have cooling racks that are identical. I was hoping for a rack that was a bit sturdier. Overall, it's not a bad pan, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
5,Love This Pan,"This a a great pan! Cooked two nice size chickens and they were fantastic. The pan cleans up easily, is light weight for stainless but sturdy. Couldn't be happier. I will be ording another to use at church."
3,Sharp Edges!,"I was really looking forward to using this pan. I've been trying to find one without the non-stick chemical coating.Well, when I took it out of the box, I noticed that the top edges of this pan are just plain sharp! Why couldn't they bevel them so you don't feel you you're going to get cut? It hurts my fingers to even press lightly on the edges.I'm going to have to return this and look around in the local stores I guess."
3,Not what I expected,"It sure looks like a turkey roasting pan! However, I guess I can't go by looks alone. It is barely large enough for a chicken! The rack barely lifts the meat (or whatever) off the bottom, so that isn't what I expected either. This was way too expensive for something this small!!! I just found one at Walmart with a better rack and a larger size for only $10. I think I'll send this one back."
5,Good deal,"I make lasagna all the time & this pan is just what I needed. The size of this one is just great, as you don't have to worry about the lasagna spilling over in the oven. It is not heavy which is good for me as I have arthritis in my hands. You can't go wrong with this one"
4,Nice and deep for big lasagnas.,"Nice finish, versatile for roasting and baking.The depth is very nice for making nice and big lasagnas. Also fits two chickens nicely for roasting.Cleans up nicely as well.Only problem is that it's a bit difficult to get the lift handles up."
3,Good size but don't trust the handles and forget the spatula,"The shape and size of this pan is excellent for lasagna but when filled, it's too heavy to trust to the small handles that are not securely attached. Also, the spatula was broken before I used it due to a very poor solder job. I purchased two at the same time because I often make a seafood lasagna and veggie lasagna at the same time. I'll continue using them but would recommend that folks look for a heavy duty version."
5,The Versitle Roasting Pan,This is a wonderful product. This was a gift for my daughter. She kept borrowing mine. So I thought it was time she have her own. We use it for deep dish lasagne. It is awesome.
2,Lack Of Literature Kills!,This was not what I expected. It cleaned up files a little bit but not as much as I expected.Don't waste your money.
1,Transparent oil-firm propaganda,"Transparent oil-firm propaganda, with absurdly predictable plot.Interesting to see how Hollywood backed the oil industry at this time.Particularly of note is James Stewart's exhortation to not worry about regulations or restrictions--just drill. And we love Jimmy Stewart movies-- but this is truly a hugely outdated period piece. Postwar attitude--get the country moving again, etc. is all over it.Movie also promotes the specious notion that oil drilling and other occupations--shrimping for instance--can co-exist with no conflict."
3,"Nice idea, faulty constuction","Nice idea, and after I worked it over in my shop, works fine. Can be used on multiple things. (I just used it to adjust the ""saddles"" on my new Thule Helium bikerack, when I couldn't move them by hand.)The problem with mine is that I couldn't fit the 3/8"" socket wrench's square end all the way into the open end. That's because there is a flange of left-over metal casting that was in the way.OK, so I used a rasp and my Makita cordless drill, and then a file, to clean this out.Well, the socket wrench wouldn't ""snap: into the square hole, and kept coming off in use, as the hole they'd drilled to accommodate the little ball bearing embedded in the square-drive end of the socket wrench is in the wrong place.Well, I drilled another hole in the right place and now it works fine.So, defective but fixable, and once fixed, a very handy thing to have in your shop."
1,Faulty Design,"I should have known, this thing cannot work, but I bought it anyway.The wrench is on the side of the filter, so when you turn, it only compresses the filter more, to the point of deforming it.So the torque applied to the wrench is only marginally transfered to the filter itself, because the filter's axle and the wrench's are not aligned.The only good thing about it is that once the oil filter has been completely deformed, it is much easier to untie it with pliers."
1,Two out of Three IS Bad!,"This particular edition of Hardy's The Dynasts would be lovely--if the publishers had included the third part of the drama!I was horrified to find that, after ordering this book to be read for a Thomas Hardy graduate seminar, I only had 2/3 of the story in front of me. One would assume that a thirty dollar paperback would at least include the complete text, but evidently that is not the case (one would also assume that this minor detail would be made clear in the listing).Bottomline, if you're interested in parts one, two, AND three, pass on this edition for another, complete, one."
2,New Barbies have bigger heads!,"The fact that Mattel has changed the head size and shape is not really apparent from the Amazon pictures, but obvious when the package is in hand. This seems to be true of all 2005 issue dolls but not those marketed in 2004 (such as Princess and the Pauper). The new bigger heads don't seem to be a problem for my 6 and 3 year olds, but I don't think these dolls are as pretty as the original size/shape. FYI: this seems to apply to all 2005 issued Barbies. What is Mattel thinking? These dolls are just not as pretty as those we had before."
5,I SAW BRIETTA,"SHE HAS A PINK DRESS WITH PEARLS AND FEATHERS, LIGHT RED HAIR, WHICH IS CURLY AND SPARKLY. SHE IS IN STORES. YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK HARD FOR HER"
2,barbie is getting older looking every year!,i love barbie but she use to look like teenager with funky clothes and cool hair styles like bratze and mysceene dolls but now she has borring old straight hair and they all have blond no strekes how old is that.this doll is okay but needs improving.i love the cali girls.i also like the fashion fever dolls but the cloths are to small for barbie or she needs a diet.when i put her clothes on they tear. but over all she is ok.
2,Leg Falling Off!,"I am very disappointed in the durability of this doll. The dress IS verrrry beautiful, although the ""reversible"" feature is sort of useless (my 6 year old could not figure out how to reattach the velcro after spinning dress around. The other dress is not quite as pretty anyway). But after only a month or so of gentle play, one of her legs is dangling out of its socket. I'm embarrassed to admit my daughter has roughly 25 Barbie dolls (many were second hand and very inexpensive though!), and this is the only one that has broken a joint. Perhaps they cut corners on the doll in order to use the more elaborate fabric on the dress? The doll was not inexpensive, so I expected it to last longer!"
4,Beautiful and durable!,"My daughter LOVES this doll. She is very durable, is beautiful, the wand of light is fun and colorful. As any little girl does, she LOVES to change her dress often and role-play along with the movie. Being that she is almost 4yrs old, having the ability to change the dress by herself easily was a bonus!I collected Barbie Dolls when I was young and the quality of this doll, the coloring in her skin, makeup, hair quality, dress quality is wonderful! Highly recommend this doll.- Heatherhttp://www.marykay.com/hbresser"
1,"Barbie begins to be old,and what`s happining to her????????????","This doll is not so beautiful,but the movie seems better than the dolls.I think that Barbie begins to be ugly,spesialy the CALI GILR dolls,but Barbie Fashion Fever dolls are gorgeous.They are perfect to collect.I have Barbie of Swan Lake Odette and the fairy queen.The movie ""Barbie of Swan Lake"" realy stinks,but the dolls are realy beautiful.From Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper collection,begins Barbie to be an ugly doll,except Fashion Fever dolls.I don`t think that this doll is so beautiful,but she has a hair just like me."
2,this thing stinks!,are you kiding! This thing is bad bad BAD BAD Bad.do not by it you will regret it! TRUST ME!!!
5,like magic..............,"I have never before seen such an elegant Barbie doll. Her hair is thick, blonde, and her eyes are beautiful in the perfect shape. Her purple dress is amazing and so elegant! This Barbie does not sing like the last Fairytale one, but she is just as good. As far as durability goes; you will not have any problems at all! Fun for most ages, somewhat afordable (although i recomend waiting for her to go on sale after the holidays because in some cities she goes for a high price tag) she does not come with alot, but is just beautiful (beyond beautiful!). Very nice doll to have."
3,"No ""Epic in Miami""?","I agree with Jeff Pipes, ""Why was the 1981 playoff game against Miami not included in this package? So much time is spent on this game in both main programs it would have been nice to watch the entire game afterwards. This omission is the only fumble in this DVD package"".The ""Missing Rings"" programme was very welcome but let's face it, given the choice between a 45 minute puff piece on Junior Seau and profiles of Luis Castillo, Roman Oben et al, most of us would rather watch ""Epic in Miami"" - NFL Films' presentation of a game that would possibly win a contest for best game of all time. This exclusion was disappointing."
5,Awesome,"This brought back so many memories, it also reminded me of how important the charger franchise was to the AFL. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to learn more about the AFL and especially to charger fans."
4,"Great history lesson, but it is already becoming outdated","This is a great history lesson for a young Chargers fan to learn about the Chargers teams of the past, but it is already becoming outdated. With the departure of Cromartie, LT, and Merriman, the Chargers are in a new era and this DVD will probably need to be redone within the next couple of years to remain relevant. I still thoroughly enjoyed some of the old football clips. I haven't gotten through the second DVD yet, but look forward to it."
5,Nice Charger History,"This DVD covered all Charger periods. Loved the Air Coryell era. Fouts, Joiner, Jefferson,Winslow, Chandler, Muncie, etc..."
4,AVID BUYERS BEWARE,"This is an excellent primer. I recommend it whole-heartedly because you won't see this good info anywhere else EXCEPT...another book by the same author titled CREATING WITH CONCRETE. Both books are identical, page for page--only the titles are different. So don't do what I did and avidly run out and buy that book too thinking it's new info...It's identical!"
4,"Great projects, easy directions, highly recommend","I've already made about 10 projects from this book. If you are a gardener, or like to 'ornament' your yard with tasteful items, this may be your book."
3,WVA430A-1AV Review,"Instructions for setup are a little confusing, but the overall product is acceptable."
4,Avatar Book Fire Vol 1,"Book 3, Vol 1 was great, but it could have been better. It's a little bit sentimental and I am used to seeing all the villians cold and cruel with not feelings."
1,A big disappointment,"This is a big disappointment for my whole family. We loved book 1&2 which is fascinating and educational. But book 3 is shallow and dumb, too much focus on dating and popularity contest. Not suitable for little kids."
4,Where's the DVD treatment this deserves???,"This is not only the best animated show on television, but one of the best shows period. The DVD's are lame, with low-def transfers, no widescreen presention, no surround sound. They are dark, washed out looking, especially on a HDTV, even with 1080p upscaling. I couldn't be more disapointed wiht the presentation or sound. I just watched ""The Clone Wars"" DVD and it reminded me of how brilliant animation can look on a 16:9 HDTV, then I watched an episode off of this dvd and realized how I had wasted $12 on it!I hope the do a delux, HD version of all three seasons at some point, this one is not worthy."
2,Beginning of Episodes are MISSING!!!!!,"ACK! Bought this to catch up on a few Season 3 Episodes and after the first one on the DVD they Cut off the entire intro and intro scenes on the rest of the episodes. There was SIGNIFICANT story info completely lost. I own the first 2 Seasons and they are great. I WILL NOT BUY another season 3 DVD is they are all like this. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????? The TV episodes for season 3 are good, but you would think they were awful if you only had this DVD to judge by. Wait until they are on Reruns on Nick, then record them. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
4,Excellent,"Witty, clever. Intelligent allusions to philosophers and literature. I highly recommend it."
4,"Very good prose, but ultimately tedious","De Botton's book is inventive, erudite, and quiteengrossing. But, it's too cerebral, too steepedin ""francophony"" intellectualism. Love is not likethat; you can't be thinking things through allthe time. Woody Allen once had a joke about theprospect of brain removal: ""Not my brain, not mysecond-favourite organ!"" And that's the crux:In love, the mind should perhaps take second place."
3,Immature,"First love usually has it's pitfalls. All love stories end. None more drastic than first love. Love is something you practice. It is work, not just pleasure. My summory is that it is a well-written, literary enjoyable book but the narrator lacks the insight to accept the ""otherness"" of the lover - see DH Lawrence's observations on togetherness and separateness. It is possible, no, necessary to be able to love someone whose taste in shoes you don't agree with. Witholding your disapproval of someone's behaviour when it doesn't hurt or affect anyone - is love. Please write another book on the same kind of experience in 20 years time - you'll see what I mean!"
5,An absolute must-read of a book!!,"This is, hands down, the most fantastic book about the bliss and the pit falls of romantic love. Elegantly written, sparse, self-conscious, full of humor and genuine feeling for all the menacing particularites of being in that awkward state known as ""in love"". I read it from beginning to end in one afternoon without a break for food, drink or the bathroom! Don't miss out on this experience. Buy it today and relish it forever."
5,Brilliant!,"A friend of mine suggested me this book when I told her that I had problems with my relationship and I followed her advice. This is a really good book and you will never understand how you got to the last page. You have probably been in the situations described in this book. If you are one of those who like to underline the passages/lines they liked, get yourself a new pen! Don't hesitate to buy this book."
5,A great read for the single girl,"If you've ever wondered, as I did, what it would be like to have a relationship with a man who was intelligent, insightful, well-read, honest, open, emotionally available, even vulnerable, had a wit that made you laugh out loud AND was madly in love with you, adored you and everything about you, check this out. Alain de Botton is brilliant."
5,Outstanding,"Funny, witty, clever. An economist's approach to love. A great book and a good, quck read. If you don't like this book, you've never been in love."
2,Didnt love it,"Dragged on too much for me. Lost him too many times. I was looking for that moment where I would say ""yesss.."" but no unfortunately."
2,Boring...this is more philosophical commentary than a novel.,"I would recommend this book to people who enjoy studying philosophy or for people who have more than a basic knowledge of kant, marx, plato...as a reader who is neither, i found myself bored with de botton's long, dry and tedious rantings. He did have a few interesting points though....worth a star or two"
5,Hilarious and heartfelt.,"Witty, erudite and insightful philosophical treatise on the joys and pains falling in and out of love. For anyone who has ever exasperated their friends with obsessive musings over the minutiae of a new-found, stale or failed relationship (and who among us has not?)."
4,Memorable,Thought it was an interesting concept and enjoyed the relationship from the man's point of view. Good find overall for an open mind.
4,"It's Love, from various aspects","I enjoy Alain de Botton's books. On Love tells such interesting stories that you can't help analyzing your own life when reading it. He's such a genius of combining analysis, humor, sarcasm, and the real life all in the book. You'd enjoy this book so much not only because Alain is a great writer but also because you can easily relate to at least couple things in the book."
3,Inspiring and accessible,"Since I already have a few 50-60's modern pieces in my home, I purchased this book to give me a better idea of what other items were out there. The designs have great style, but seem totally achievable. Using this book as a guide and source of inspiration you could decorate your home in a comfortable yet stylish manner. Some of the pieces they show are pricey, while others are probably inexpensive flea market finds. The author gives you enough information that you could go out into the flea markets and antique/second hand shops and make some sound purchase. It is a shame the book is less than 200 pages. I would have loved to see more."
2,A complete mess,"I am only giving this even 2 stars because some of the stories in it are interesting. Enough so that you keep reading the book. But this book contains some of the worst writing I have ever seen. As other posts have mentioned, there are spelling mistakes everywhere. But what is worse is that the book follows no timeline, or formula so stories involving dozens of names of people become a confusing mess. It's pretty much a complete mess and it's hard to believe it got published in this form. To top that off the author seems to think he's the only person on earth who knows anything about bike gangs. His ego is massive. Since the book was written, half of this theories in this book about the future of the gangs have been wrong."
5,great mounting option,"This is a great mounting option, especially when using DSLR cameras. Between the small size of the clamp and the small size of the camera, it allows you to film in very tight and unconventional places. It really opens up a lot of creative angles."
5,Sturdy construction. Perfect for my needs!,I plan to use this to attach a Zoom H2 Handy Recorder to the side of my camera tripod for better audio recording (the mic in my camcorder is terrible). This little gadget is perfect. Nice solid construction and small size for excellent portability. You can clamp it to something at any angle and still be able to have your camera (or other device) positioned level to the ground.
5,Buy more than one,"This has to be the most useful clamp in the studio! Use it to mount a 7"" monitor, Zoom recorder, wireless receiver, small video camera, digital camera... I started with one - now there are three or four of these floating around. Great clamp for the money - ""buy more than one"""
5,Attached to car window fits very good,"I been using it for a day now and i love it, attached to the car windows stays strong all the way, tested with a powershot sx20 IS. I do recommend this clamp."
4,"half the weight, twice the versatility.","In lieu of a heavy, bulky tripod, I have often considered the use of a clamp pod and the one that was previously in my arsenal of gadgets was a cast iron c-clamp thing when carried in the camera bag often made me limp. This one is a lot lighter and can clamp to a few more things."
3,Decent Quality - rubber mount pops off!,"The first time I used mine I lost the rubber shoe that goes on the end of the screw because it just pops right off. I do like the idea of it being removable, however it would be nice if it screwed on or something.The gap in the clamp isn't wide enough to fit on a heavier guitar body (just in case anyone in looking for it for that purpose - like I was).Other then those factors it works well with my GoPro!"
3,"Pretty handy, wish it held together better...","I was very happy with this clamp and have used it for several different applications. However, this must have been too much for the clamp foot-pad which detached fairly quickly after purchase. I kept up with the separate parts and used them that way for a while but the pad finally got away from me on a ski-lift. I emailed the nice folks at Pedco asking to purchase a replacement part, but never heard back from them, which made me sad..."
2,Sort of flimsy,Not the best thing I ever invested in. Probably will never use it but if the joints were a bit tighter I would very frequently.
5,Perfect,This is exactly what I needed. It works perfectly and the quality of the build is great. It's nice and solid.
4,Review Pedco Ultra Camp,Length:: 3:35 MinsGreat device to go with your video or still camera. You can mount it just about anywhere. Its an inexpensive way to get camera angles you hadn't thought possible.
5,Works Great on the Deer Blind Windows,"I got this mount to put on the windows of my deer blind when hunting. With this mount and my ContourHD camera, I can film all the action in the deer blind when making videos for my Hunting Channel TexasNative00 on YouTube."
5,Excellent product,Just my headline. Goog quality and you can use were you wont. Its like a transformer. Ja ja. Sorry 4 my english.
5,Very Handy Camera Mount,I bought this to use for applications where standard or mini tripods won't work. It's a VERY flexible little mount. Clamp to car windows. Clamp it to a step ladder for a high perspective. Drive a bent nail into a tree and you can clamp it to that.Several pivot points enable you to twist it in any direction you need to provide the view you want.If you ever use a camera mount you need one of these. I highly recommend for professional and hobby imagers!
5,Well Made and Handy,Just what I was looking for to mount my cameras on the car window. Very well made and handy to have in my camera bag.
4,solid,"I bought this to mount my camera to the handlebar of my motorcycle. my camera is relatively bulky so it jars around a little more than one would hope. (not the clamp's fault) this little thing holds on for dear life and the ball/socket joint at the top allows you to place it at any position you could possibly think of. just bear in mind its designed for a small camera like a flip and anything bigger puts a lot of torque on it when it gets hit with engine vibration or a bump, causing a shaky picture. I did notice, though, that despite all the movement it always returned to its original position without me having to touch it -- no drifting."
3,So So,"I was looking for a way to be able to remove my memory card quickly without having to fuss so much with the tripod. This gadget tripled my work but it has some nice features and some irritating ones. For a smallish camera (Panasonic FZ40), it is more than sufficiently sturdy but to release the camera (and access the memory card), the settings (positions) are lost. If they are important (which they are in my situation), this is not good, but worse even than that is the fact that two knobs have to twisted to loosen the locking feature so ""quick"" simply does not describe this but if I wanted to take time lapsed pictures and keep the camera in the same place for a long time, this would be great. I like the compact size and stability but the knobs are a nuisance."
1,poor,poor quality a lot of movement I don't recommend this at all . im going to start to look for something that can hold my camera still
4,Window Mount,I plan on using this mount for a car mounted camera when thunderstorms roll in so I wont need to be out in the weather. I will give a better review once I use it in the field but it looks as though it will last quite awhile with moderate use. Plastic is a high grade poly-ethlyn plastic similar to what they use to make pallets out of. The knobs as others have stated do look like they could strip out with excessive force so be careful. 1 turn past snug is all you need. If things change with the product I will update the post.
5,Perfect for attaching Mics and Recorders,"This is a great addition to my ""Run and Gun"" setup. I clamp this onto my monopod and can attach my Digital Sound Recorder to it. The multiple articulating angles allow me to put it in the perfect position.I've also used this to attach a shotgun microphone onto the end of a door to get a great improved dialogue that is out of the picture."
5,Excellent Clamp,"Works great with Contour Roam. Have attached it to all sorts of things, but beston the mountain bike frame and motorcycle. Vibration is surprisingly not a problem."
5,Fantastic tripod/clamp,"This is an excellent, quality product. I bought two and will be using them to mount POV cams for wedding videography. I have purchased two in each of the 3 available sizes. (I did have to buy the 4"" directly from ATS Communications - Marty was great to deal with and shipped them to me as soon as he had them in stock). With all 3 sizes, I will be in good shape to mount my POV cams in just about any wedding venue. Can't say about durability since I have not used them yet, however the construction is very solid and not at all flimsy, so I'm really not concerned. I believe they will serve me well for many years."
5,Holds like a vice,"Ultra secure, light weight, flexible and versatile - what's not to love? Design allows quick and accurate position adjustments. Its primary use is to clamp to a tubular interior frame member of an airplane for recording aerobatics. It has been used with a Creative Vado HD and with a Sony compact camera and it has held them solid as a rock during 4G maneuvers."
5,Pedco,"I like to make videos while driving, a lot of problem with the minis tripod, but with this clamp in my window is easy!!!!!"
4,Good Clamp,"I have bought a couple clamps to use in a Car Scene with my 7D not knowing what is best I bought this one and another one that uses 2 suction cups from Delkin and I found myself using this one more and more. The build quality is good and it has tons of uses, I would have bought a couple more but the price went up right after I bought it."
4,Works with Tot Lock,"This does work with the Tot Lock system. Make sure you watch the shipping and handling costs. I paid $5. This still made this product less expensive than the outrageously expensive Tot Lock extra key. I know this seems like a lot to pay for a magnet, but you'll be glad for the extra key."
5,outstanding prenatal and postpartum fitness guide,"This book covers it all; prenatal and postpartum, beginner to advanced, cardio, strength training, core stability, as well as explaining all of the normal physiologic changes in a woman's body throughout pregnancy. Very concise and easy to read with lots of accompanying photograghs.I am a family physician that does a lot of prenatal and postpartum care in a very fit community---this book is indispensible in my practice!"
1,a disapointment,"I was really looking forward to using this book, but unfortunately it was a disappointment. Its useful to get an idea of the things you can do but only if your fitness knowledge is at an advanced level. The explanations are confusing, the suggested workouts assume you know certain things, there are exercises without images, or even not included just named. Another criticism is that even within the same chapter the exercises are named slightly different so it becomes again confusing.Over all it is not an easy book to use, it is badly edited and missing basic information when in others are overdone. In the end it is useless to have something complicated explained to such detail when the basics are not clear.Really it was quite a disappointment."
2,I expected better,"It's allright. I've had trouble getting into it - I've found I get better ideas and a better workout from pregnancy fitness videos. Aesthetically speaking, the black & white photos on the the inside are not inspiring.Overall: not impressed."
3,A good soldier's officer - they do exist!,"Good read, with a nice view of the period covered (1899-1914), and a very PC young officer - almost anachronistically so, but hey, it IS fiction. Reading about a 'colonial British officer' giving a damn about the colonised sort of goes against the general press they've received, but no doubt they did exist, and Murdoch MacKinder is a nice guy.I found myself believing his struggles with both his position within the professional and personal spheres, and enjoyed the preparation and de- briefing parts of the action pieces - not just the action itself. Also the comment on the performance of the British higher officers in their context was interesting, if smacking a lot of hindsight: this was the part I found hardest to believe.I enjoyed it, and found myself searching for the sequel on-line - sez enough for me!"
1,Double Trouble,This is a cute movie but I would not have bought it if I had known it was a cartoon version.The write up says that it stars Duncan Regehr and it does not.Think you should change your description of this item Thank You
3,JUST OK,This dvd is not that bad. If you want to entertain yourself with some beautiful ladies angel than get this dvd and have some pleasure.
4,Ava Fabian,"The one reason to check this disk out, imho, is that there is a nice strip tease by former Playboy Playmate Ava Fabian at the beginning. Not a bad scene for Ava fans! As others have said, the rest of the disk is very ordinary."
1,Rachael's angels,"this video is horrible. women are very beautful, but is extremely boring. might as well get a sports illistrated because that is about as much nudity as this will give you.Rachel's Angels"
1,Tiny Box-Big Disappointment,"I purchased this box for my boyfriend as an early Christmas gift, and I was a little disappointed by its lack of craftsmanship especially for the price! I expected a sturdy impressive box and I got a cheaply produced one with crooked metal facings..the hinged piece for the pad lock is already about to come off and the color of the wood varied from the picture shown. I would suggest anyone looking for a good treasure chest to keep on looking!!!"
4,Great dry shampoo,"This dry shampoo really works and it smells great. It does not leave a powder residue, either. Great for after the gym."
3,Greatly surprised,"Ordered the product before giving birth since in Chinese traditon we are not supposed to bath or wash your hair for a month after giving birth. So I ordered it and used it for the one week I did try to follow the chinese tradition. It worked great but after the week, I gave in and took a shower and washed my hair. Great for one to two days of not washing ;your hair but beyond that...I could not do it."
1,Would be great if it worked,I ordered the Algemarine Dry-spray shampoo one week ago and the can is already dead. I've used this product once. It's a great product when it works but unfortunately the faulty design prohibits it from working more than one time. Not worth wasting your money.
3,Was used up too fast!,"I liked this product well enough and it worked, but it got used up so fast that I decided it wasn't worth the money to continue purchasing. I'd rather use the Suave dry shampoo because it lasts longer and I only have to spend a few extra minutes using a flat iron for it to work. If you're on a budget, I wouldn't recommend this, but if you have money to blow, go for it! It worked for my hair. For reference I have normally thick fairly oily hair that gets VERY flat the days in between shampoos."
1,poor,"The product did not work for dry shampoo for me. It was very thick, and sit on my scalp, and did not clean my hair."
3,Not bad,"Not the best dry shampoo especially for the price. This product warns against leaving a white residue on clothing and it really does. It also leaves your hair dull. My favorite so far, which is at a similar price, is in a gold bottle by umberto."
4,Get the travel size - aerosol gas wont seep out,"Most all full size dry shampoos seep-out the aerosol gas due to the type of elements used in the product vs the gas presser within the can.You need to either find a way to seal the actual spout with glue or puddy. Or better yet, just get a couple cans of the travel size, which has less pressure and will not seep-out the aerosol gas."
5,Best I've Ever Tried...Won't Use Anything Else,"I have tried the only two brands available in my city. This dry shampoo by far, is the best. It renews your hair daily. What you have to know:It sprays on white. No biggie. I just use it at night. By the morning the white is gone.Many have commented about the smell. Trust me it goes away after about 15-30 minutes. And it is not offensive. A little off-putting when you spray it on, because you are a bit afraid it will overpower. It will not.Trust, me this is the best around. And price is close to what I pay for other products. I hope you like it!"
2,Just okay,"This is okay but I have found much better results with Batiste, and it's cheaper. This scent is a little medicinal."
1,Algemarin Dry Shampoo,"I liked it initially, but then the second time I used it it didn't work. So, it was a waste of Money!"
1,don't buy it !!!!!!!!!,total waste of my money. should have heeded the earlier reviews. clogged after 1st use. don't waste your money. product was worthless. pale powder doesn't work on dark hair... if you can get it to spray after the initial use.
3,"Nice, but a pretty cheap product.","I really can't live without this since my hair gets oily a mere 3 hours after washing it, but every 3rd can of this stuff goes flat after two uses. It's really annoying, but what are you going to do? Also, the shipping charges are outrageous."
2,It's Ok not great!,This product makes my hair frizzy. I have used other dry shampoos and never had that result. I gave it 2 stars because it's better than nothing and I didn't have any clugging problems with the spray. I prefer the Dry Shampoo from Barista because it leaves the hair cleaner with no frizz.
3,"Dry shampoo - great idea, but...","I bought this prior to my having surgery. I wasn't able to walk up steps to take a shower, and my hair gets greasy within 24 hours, so I wanted to look semi-decent when my friends came to visit, take care of me at home. I used the spray on day 2 days after washing, and it actually didn't look too bad. It made a mess of white powder, when I brushed my hair, but ah, for the sake of vanity. Two days later, I washed my hair, and again, two days after that, tried to use the dry shampoo. The tip was totally clogged. I tried soaking the tips in hot water, and when something finally came out, it was just not as closely nice as the first time I used it. Beginners luck or whatever, I asked someone to buy me a headband and sucked in the vanity of my greasy hair. There's GOT to be a product out there that works well, right? I remember PSSSSSST from my youth, but why can't you buy that in the stores anymore? Probably for a good reason.... Nothing beats a good ol' shampooing."
1,Waste of money,"I used this product twice, both in the morning when I had to be somewhere but didn't have a chance to take a shower. The first time, I noticed almost no difference. The second time, I used a little bit more product and thought it worked a little better... but still not so well that I would be comfortable going anywhere important because my hair was still somewhat greasy-looking. The third time I went to use it... the bottle was empty. Not simply clogged, totally empty. So I got maybe 12 puffs out of the entire bottle. I definitely do not recommend."
1,One and done.,worked great and smelled great but after the first use the can leaked any pressure and no more use could be had. So sad.
1,It is a okay product,"the first three uses went great but the spray just does not work the fourth time, it is basically powder mixed with fluid scents, smells fresh though. Disappointed over all. I order another kind later and it works better since it is a small travel size with dry organic powder."
2,Not worth the money,"While the product works it only lasts 4 uses. If you attempt to go two days without washing your hair, the smell is so overpowering, no one wants their hair to smell so strongly of old lady perfume. I do not recommend this product! I did not have any problems with the can leaking air, it just ran out of product too quickly. In order to make it last longer you would probably have to lightly spritz your roots, but having blonde hair I needed it for more than a spritz."
4,Dry Shampoo,I use this when I straighten my hair since I don't wash it everyday then. It works better then baby powder :)
4,Very good product,I really like this product. It is a great help with a new baby in the house. Some days I just don't have the time to wash my super oily hair and this is a great second choice. It doesn't leave a white residue in my hair like some other brands.The only con is that it has a bit of a perfume-y smell. Since the price is much lower than other brands I can accept the smell.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I do not have this doll but I can tell she is poorly made. She is just made of cheap plastic not rubber. She has a very ugly dress too. And her unicorn is just a stuffed animal. I would get a different doll. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
3,please note error,"All please note that the Galveston hurricane occurred on Sept. 8, 1900, and not May 8, like the book says.This makes me wonder exactly how accurate the rest of the book, which is pretty entertaining and reads like a daily newspaper (death, destruction, dismay), actually is."
3,For the sporadic reader...,"The chronology is fun... the accuracy, dubious... the occasional follow-up commentary, slightly amusing... the objectivity, mild... the compilation, notably broad... I read this book over the course of a couple of months, whenever I had to sit down. If you are looking for factual historical record, you'll need a supplement. I did enjoy it."
1,Bad manufaturer,I have owned 2 of these power supplies and both have bought the farm. One of them blew 2 drives because of faulty voltage. Do not buy and ULTRA power supplies! Stay away! You can get an equivalent cooler master psu with 6 rails and much better power. I finally chunked my ultra and got a coolermaster 850watt and my computer is running so much better!
5,Good read,"A friend told me this was the antidote to boring business books and he has a point.The book has some pluses: Good warnings about vulture capitalists and the value of the ""double P's"" passion and pragmatism. I liked his analysis of what makes succesful entrepreneurs tick and examples of how tenacious people turned ideas into fortunes. My favorite was the guy who makes diamonds out of cremated remains as keepsakes for the bereaved. Where did the author find these people?America should stop whining about the decline of big business jobs and get off its collective butt like these entrepreneurs who showed spunk and made millions."
3,Useful but incredibly overpriced,"Snoots are useful. This one is built extremely well. However the amount of money that Quantum charges for what is essentially a hollow metal tube is just ridiculous. You could build yourself one of these for less than $1. My 3 star rating is based purely on the price. Were this to be < $10, I'd give it a 5 star rating."
2,Too much BBQ for me,"I wasn't a fan of this ""variety"" pack. Only 1 or 2 bags of my favorites, and over 10 bags of BBQ. Granted, 3 different kinds of BBQ, but they all tasted the same to me and I didn't like any of them. Also included were 3 bags of pork rinds which I also don't eat. Ended up giving away over half of the case to friends. Waste of money for me, won't be ordering this pack again."
1,not so good,the product was rather stale upon arrival and not very good. probably a good idea not to purchase these
1,Stale,Agree with the last review. The shipment I received was stale. Almost like these were out of date (but there isn't an expiration date on them). Buy at your own risk.
5,Not so bad,What can you say? It's candy. It's very good. Mine was fresh. It was exactly what I was expecting and came with Amazon's usual quick delivery.
5,Centrum Vitamins,Excellent quick delivery and these vitamin pills are great. Been taking them for a week now and I can feel the difference.
2,Expiration Date very close to maturity,"Expiration Date very close to maturity, which does not has time for one person to consume the entire product. I don't liked it."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I knitted my first sweater with the great instructions from this book. Very easy to follow, recommend to anyone learning to knit. Great selection of sweater to chose from."
5,A must for Pro's using tripods!,As the title says... we are professional photographers and without this simple clamp where are you going to hang your flash battery. This has turned into a fantastic alternative. Highly recommend.
4,Sweet and simple,"Buy this for the art work more than the story. It's lovely to look at, and, after only one reading, pre-readers will be able to enjoy this book on their own."
4,Helps in Low Morale,"I am tasked to manage an extremely low morale team in a high tech environment. It is very difficult to find the motivating triggers for my employees. I picked up this book and found it very helpful. I actually had each of my employees do a personality assessment and it not only helped me to work better with them and their development, but also allowed me to identify ways to motivate each personality type. I enjoyed the book. I agree, it is not a complex subject and will most likely not be used in a philosophy class, but that is what I enjoyed. It took the concept of personality assessments and streamlined it to find the basic, common result (a better working relationship with myself and my direct reports.)"
3,Where are the 1001 ways to inspire?,"I expected to find 1001 ways to inspire my team, organization and self, as the title indicates. Normally, such books have numbered suggestions and creative ideas, usually adding up to 1001.What was strange for me is that this book presented, not 1001 ideas, but 4 personality types and suggestions on dealing with them. I am not sure if the title was the author's idea or the publisher's suggestion, but it is somewhat unfortunate, as it is misleading to the reader.However, the writing style is clear, and many of the points made on working with different personality types are valid and helpful. If looking for information on personality types, this book would be somewhat useful, but if looking for a list of creative tips or ideas to inspire, this book does not really fit the bill."
1,Business Objects,I agree.. I just received the book and I was very disappointed. The book looked like it was written for 10 year olds and was full a typos. It looked like someone wrote it out of their home. For the intermiediate Business Objects user.. save your money.. this book is not worth the pages its printed on. I can not believe Amazon would stock such a book like this. I would strongly suggest savinging your money and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!
2,Saved (only) by the name...,"The only redeeming factor of this book is the vast references to the screenplay and novel. The self-help twists and advice offered by the author are none to which a Southern lady would lend an ear. I bought 2 copies of this book: 1 for a friend, a real Gone With the Wind enthusiast, and 1 for myself. I gave it to her before I read my copy. I apologized afterward. Yes, it's that bad!"
4,A Great Gift Idea,"In the category of ""Why Didn't I Think of That?"" I'm surprised someone didn't come up with the idea for this book earlier! Scarlett Rules takes one of the most famous heroines in American literature and draws upon her character and experiences to give modern-day women some practical advice for everyday living. Scarlett Rules is a fun read and a great gift idea!"
4,Great fun,"Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most enduring heroines of modern literature. She was a monster in many ways but was so brave, so resourceful, and so willing to sacrifice everything for love that millions of women fell in love with character and wanted to be her. Well, follow the Scarlett Rules and you too can work your way to your own Tara, your own solid ground and maybe your own Rhett.This little book is a lot of fun and is terribly cute but don't get carried away. Remember, in the end Scarlett blew it and lost both Rhett and Ashley."
4,Solid!,"Based out of Ft. Collins Colorado, The Mandrake is a solid example of an up and coming melodic Death Metal band. The songs are varied yet concise in their sound. The riffing is heavy and tuneful and vocals mesh well with the churning, fast paced and technical style The Mandrake has created. Having seen the band live, I feel qualified to say that their performances are a match for the studio recordings on this album, and a testament to the bands tallent. This, their second album, is a fine example of all that melodic Death Metal has to offer."
5,A Great Underrated Read,"These stories are great reading. He was really a master of the short story. I especially like those stories based in ""the colonies"", Asia, Africa. Great reading on plane. I read them in Africa and he truly captures the dichotomy/hypocrisy between the white man and the native(s)."
2,Quick Printing,"Before shelling out $66 for this magazine, you should check out their Web site and see if you qualify for a free subscription since most of their subscribers do get the magazine without paying for it.This is not a publication for consumers but professional printers and will not be of much interest to people who are looking for information on the subject of printing technology. It has a marketing and management orientation and is driven primarily by ad sales, so you will not read much that is controversial or critical of advertisers in this publication. Articles are generally written to support monthly advertising themes.You might also want to check out these similar magazines before spending any money to get Quick Printing: Graphic Arts Monthly (www.graphicartsmonthly.com), Instant and Small Commercial Printer (www.innespub.com) and American Printer (www.americanprinter.com). These are also available for free to professional printers and other qualified subscribers."
2,This is not the same as the '90s original,"I bought a bottle of this back in the late '90s and always got compliments on it. My then girlfriend now wife loved it. Unfortunately Nautica stopped making it so I switched to other colognes. When I found this on Amazon I was quick to pick it up, but unfortunately this is not the same scent. Nowhere near as good."
4,Good Reference book,"Great book, only negative is that it's a little out of date now. Last update was in 1995 which in design terms is a long time!"
2,Not waterproof,I like these shoe covers when the ground is dry outside..When the contractors come in from the outside and slip those on the water leaks right through and some dirt. I think these are great shoe or foot covers for people already wearing inside shoes? Or dry shoes only w/ out caked on mud!
2,Shoe Covers - Too Small,"Although these shoe covers look like all the others out there, as a Realtor, I'd say this is false advertising to call them ""Large"", and Amazon doesn't seem to offer an ""Extra Large"" option. Mostly women and children were able to fit these on their shoes, but not men, so they aren't of much use at my open houses. Com'n Amazon! Read all the reviews and amp up the sizing option."
4,Good Price for Adequate Covers,"I bought these to try to protect the just cleaned carpet in a house that's for sale. Similar shoe covers found locally were much more expensive. My criticism for these is the way they are rolled. At first glance it's not obvious how these are meant to go onto a shoe. It was only after trying to get them on the wrong way that I discovered how they work. (They're folded like a fitted sheet and 10 covers are rolled together.) On the positive side, the price is right, shipping is included even without the $25 minimum purchase, and they arrived sooner than expected."
3,Never got to use it....,"It showed up 2 days later than I needed them. Havent even opened the box. Can't blame Dynarex for that, though."
1,Do not buy they come with no labels and are out-of-date!!!!!,Very bad purchase. Mine came in a box with no paperwork and the bottle itself had no label whatsoever on it. They gauge reads up tp 6000 psi on a 3000 max psi bottle scary. The fools at action village will tell you that this is the way all warrgames bottles come but I found some with labels and 3000 psi gauges at my local Canfield store.
4,YOU'LL GET A KICK FROM THIS SILLY MOVIE,"Alrhough filled with familiar cliches, characters and special effects, THE KARATE DOG should provide an entertaining ninety minutes of family entertainment. Simon Rex (the last two SCARY MOVIES) stars as a computer savvy policeman who finds himself in possession of a talking karate dog (voiced by Chevy Chase). Together they plan to solve the murder of the dog's beloved owner (the late Pat Morita) at the hands of corporate mogul Jon Voight (deliciously hammy). All this while falling in love with fellow officer Jaime Pressly.The jokes are not tremendously funny but the movie's so warm-spirited and all the dogs and cats as cute as can be, so forget the plot and just enjoy the merriment."
4,good cd,ENJOYED THIS CD VERY MUCH GOOD ROCK CD AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE SINGER SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL LIKE THIS ONE
4,My granddaughter liked it,"These easy reader books are very good for beginning readers, and are entertaining for the kids to read because they have cute story lines. My granddaughter reads these books to us at bedtime"
3,Doesn't Go Far Enough...,"While I really like this book and feel it explains well, I did need to mark it down a bit since I don't think that it emphasizes enough how kids should not pretend to use guns or stay away from them. The fact that this is only addressed on one page, versus the several pages of how a gun works, was disappointing. I'm not reading this to my sons so they know the difference between guns & how they work... and to get them excited about the concept of how a bullet can travel to the end of the block before they'd even take a step in a race... I'd rather find a book that will supplement the safety training we try to give our children about staying away from guns... not pretending to shoot people... etc..."
4,"works very well, lightweight","I live off-grid, and have been researching solar chargers for two years...it works perfectly for iPods, handheld games (we only have the Nintendo DS), cell phones, and battery chargers (AAA and AA)...i hope to use it with my mac laptop, but cannot find a car/lighter type charger (am still looking!)...it also works well even with long term haze or some clouding...if interested, I recommend to put this item in your shopping cart and watch the prices, i've seen it from $299 to well over $400, so unless you need it asap, you can buy it when the price falls."
2,misleading specs,This panel is nice but the most wattage I ever got was 11 watts.They claim at the mfg website 26 watts max at a max of 1.4 amps.Well the max voltage you could have without destroying your typicalelectrical device is about 15 volts. Watts equals 15 x 1.4or a maximum of 21 watts. The claimed 26 watts is not even possible.In realty the maximum I got was 11 watts. For an eleven watt paneladvertised at 11 watts it would be good.
5,More energy than I expected,I bought this with the Xantrex Technologies 852-2070 XPower PowerPack Energy Pack for the inverter and energy storage. They complement each other really well. The panel is able to collect a great amount of energy and keep things running for hours.
1,%&#)&^)^^^,"Amazon really screwed up on this one. Two weeks after I placed the order for this air filter, I received an empty box! When I brought this to the attention of Amazon, I was sent another, but this time, I got something that resembles a tiny button. Either someone is sabotaging Amazon, or Amazon hired some real moron!"
2,It could have been much better!,"I keep telling myself to look at the genre and judge accordingly. This book, however, doesn't make the grade for me in any way except the genre. I like a romance when I want light, mindless reading. As for as mindless reading, it filled the bill. As for character development, not so much. The characters are lightweight, stereotypical and insipid. So is the plot. It could have been so much better, given the location and the premise. So much for my Ciji Ware experiment. I was hoping she would get better but only gets worse."
5,What???,"I'm not sure why, but this book comes up when I was looking for slip covers for my loveseat. Someone needs to take it out and put it under ""Books."""
2,Cheesy...,"This book is readable, but I found it to be really annoying. The actual story is interesting, but it was the characters I couldn't stand, especially Corlis. I'm going to begin work on my Master's degree in September so I was happy to see a novel about historic preservation, but unfortunately it seemed a bit far-fetched and at times almost laughable.I enjoyed the parts of the story that took place in the past the most, the historical details were fascinating. But Corlis drove me crazy with her reasons on why she kept being able to see the past, just accept it already! Also, the kidnapping of King seemed to kind of just come out of the blue, and it seemed to be solved and wrapped up too easily.All in all, I wouldn't say that this book was unreadable and there are some fascinating elements in this book, but the characters were just hard to get past."
4,Great read!,I really enjoyed the detail of the location. I liked the story because it kept me interested throughout the story.
4,Another Time/Another World,"Loved reading about the New Orleans of the past. how can we not learn to accept everyone based on what they contribute, not what color they are and how they live. We also need to learn to preserve our past heritage. Great reading."
4,Happy Love,These books are formulaic but fun and you get what you expect. Lots of interesting New Orleans history as an added bonus.
4,Midnight on Julia Street,"This was an interesting and fast paced story, intriguing story and you never knew what was going to happen next."
2,Mixed experience,"The HCM511A did not come with a power supply, could not use it out of the box. Opted to buy a costly POE hub to power it. Added another $150 onto the total cost to use the unit.The HCM511A video sampling rate creates cross talk on the audio circuit. The net effect is an audio beat loud enough to interfere with normal audio reception. Panasonic support is offshore, in Jamaca, they are completely worthless.Unit dows not have enough resolution to identify unknown people. Wide angle lense is far to wide, things in the distance are lost in resolution. Close up on the bird's nest was OK, 8 inches.You must use Internet Explorer and the active X plugin for the audio feed. Hey Panasonic!, not everyone uses Windows, nor should they be made to do so to use your products.While the HCM511A can serve up to 30 users directly and has a number of useful confgiurations, I would look to another brand for a higher quality product."
5,works as intended,Great camera worked for a couple of years no issues. Have bought more since the original purchase and will purchase more if needed.
1,Does Not Include Power Supply,"Buyer beware, does not include power supply.Camera arrived without power supply, will not operate without a power supply unless you are running Poe?Description of item should state obvious accessories not include to make camera work"
4,Power to the Black Ranger,"This is great for lovers of the best, and original power rangers. When the Black Ranger was Black and the Yellow Ranger was asian. Unlike the power rangers nowadays, the ones in this video dont need stunt doubles, They can actualy fight. Jason and Zack really beat down the putties with some fighting skills. The secound episode of this tape had some good action. Get this tape for some action with the REAL power rangers. Holla!"
4,Power Rangers: Black Ranger Adventure,"If you like the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers you will enjoy this video. The original rangers are very entertaining and have a sense of fun that doesn't seem as 'commercial' as they do now. Just remember when you are watching that you aren't there for the great acting, an engrossing story-line, or realistic special effects. It is entertainment aimed at the very young."
2,One caveat: THIS IS ONLY A TRANSLATION.,"This work is fine, for what it is... What it is NOT (and I assume the entire series is not), is an Aramaic Bible.Note the category ""Religion and Spirituality"": Unlike the misleading series _title_, the ... _category_ doesn't say anything about the Aramaic language. When I bought this book, I was looking for an actual Aramaic Targum of Isaiah. Not here, folks.I may eventually find a use for this volume anyway -- Chilton is a first-rate scholar -- but I was VERY disappointed to find that there was NO ARAMAIC TEXT OF THE ISAIAH TARGUM in it; it is ONLY a translation and notes. If you're looking for the genuine article, you're going to pay hundreds of dollars for it (probably directly to the publisher)."
5,Bear Makers New and Old: Buy This Book!!,"I've been making bears for 20 years and this is the most complete book, most detailed, easy to understand book I have every seen. I have many bear making books, but now feel I can get rid of them and just use this one as a reference. Wonderful for the beginning bear maker or the very experienced. No matter what you will learn something new. The photos are spectacular. I used two of the lessons right away and will use many more. You can tell a very detailed and a lover of bears type person wrote this book."
5,Unbelievable resource.,This isnt much to say about this book except to get it. I was an intermediate bear maker and my mother is an expert bear maker and this book helped both of us. It has a wealth of information and is very easy to read and understand. The patterns are cute and fun. Buy it!
5,Awesome!!!,"I purchased this for my 2y/o for his birthday. Some of the reviews on the other videos stated that the video did not have a ""Play All"" function and had to start each video individually....this is NOT the case with this one. There is a play all and will play all four videos.The episodes that come with this are:Humpty DumptyCinderellaPinnocchioRumplestiltskinIt's the same episodes that are on TV and follow the same format."
1,Broke taking it out of the case,This DVD seems to be flimsier than usual. One side broke in half when we removed it from the box. Didn't even t=get to wach it once. Very disappointing.
4,My 16 mos old loves it!!,Kept my son entertained. It is educational and the music was fun.Would definitely buy more of the dvd's.It is fun.
3,swedens new power metal,i like this cd the signer sounds a little like the dude who sang in candlemass.this band if you like bands like hammerfall with there catchy powermetal riffs and anthems make this a must but got this promo from the metal show i do and a lt of people where into it so if you like done over power metal slap the bucks down...for the import you wont regreat it
5,IRRISISTIBLE READ,"Glen from Pennsylvania, in his mid-life crisis, has no inkling of what he is setting in motion by happily giving a ride to these two teenaged Jamaican girls. What is conversational pleasantry to him becomes no less than a promise of salvation to Rosalind riding, with her friend, in the back seat.This tale unfolds within a bubble of culture clash, which intensifies into impending tragedy - except - one could say, except that Rosalind seriously complicates things.This book is irresistible because of its shining Truth about these ""simple, ordinary"" people. Here is grinding poverty, yet so rich with life, that it shows us the poverty of our plentitude.I loved this book. I ruined a good nights' sleep over it. It enriched my heart."
3,Memorable,"I get the feeling the author really enjoyed writing the sex scenes since they are the most detailed parts of the book! The story is great overall with lots of interesting and memorable characters. Could have used an editor to shorten it down tho -- it dragged in the middle. The cheap shot at Russell Banks was a little pretentious, but no harm done. Recommended!"
2,Not impressed,"Does what it says. Feels super cheap. SUPER cheap, and WAY too easy to rock back and forthbleh, i dont use it"
5,Much needed,"I've been playing live gigs with my synthesizers for years. Since moving to soft synths and using USB keyboards, I somehow missed obtaining the pedals used to control volume and other aspects and had to do it all by hand (literally). During the last show, I used this product in my live stage performance, and I can tell you that it worked amazingly well, no distortion, easily placed, and did not slide around or (walk) as some foot controllers tend to do. Didn't need to nail this one down, it stayed in place throughout the entire show's run. I noticed that it also really felt ""good"". Not too much resistance pressure and ""stayed"" put on the setting with no perceivable drift."
2,"generic,not the quality of past product.",These are generic with Ignited name! Past product was great and better quality. Its a shame Ignited has succumbed to selling junk! Amazon customer service is the best! They consider a customers satifaction and the return was not a problem. Thank you Amazon.
4,SMOKIN' ORGAN MUSIC,I WAS SO GLAD TO LOCATE THIS CD AND AM USING SEVERAL OF THE CUTS FOR THE TAP CLASSES I TEACH - SUCH GOOD BEAT!!
3,Comprehensive and fun,"This CD set certainly shows the versatility of Ethel Smith, although only a handful can truly be considered gems. There is certainly plenty here for the enthusiastic admirer, although more than a few tracks have become more campy with age. I eventually felt like I was trapped in a roller rink. Still, I definitely am pleased to have it in my collection."
1,"This is Dancehall Reggae, NOT Bollywood!!!","This is a collection of dancehall reggae tracks from the usual suspects that appear on these types of collections- elephant man, etc. I have NO idea why they decided to call this collection ""Bollywood"". There is no Bollywood music here at all-just dancehall reggae straight from Jamaica. If anyone knows why please fill me in."
5,collection,I found this doll a nice addition to the collection. They all mimic the orginal outfits of the country very well.
4,Beautiful,My daughter received this for her 6th birthday. She wanted a luau party and loves all things Hawaiian right now. The doll is beautiful.
5,Answers for SELF,"I recently read this book cover to cover without putting it down. For anyone seeking out 'self' discovery, this is for you! I've studied the enneagram for five years now. It's amazing to realize that the darkest side of you is shared by so many others. It's a humbling sense and also validation. This particular book speaks in educated layman's terms. No charts or graphs to decihper, as are found in other books on this topic. It's clear and simple, yet quite moving. For the beginner to pick this up and begin to discover their own personality, it's wonderful! For an advanced study, it's a fantastic quick reference to obtaining information that is concise. I have nearly two dozen enneagram books. This one is most certainly at the top of my personal list. Manily for it's simplicity ... and for a 4 personality, that means a LOT!"
5,great sports tape,"It may be hard to rip pieces for some.strong tape that will take your hairs off, men watch those legs! when wet without cover the tape falls off like any other tape. If you know the taping techniques it could be very supportive. I used it on hands and toes to protect and support. gorilla duck tape is stronger and more waterproof but probably not good on skin! Ha Ha! Enjoy!"
5,Great tape for all sporting needs,You won't find a better sport tape on the market. It sticks your skin fantastically and won't come off when wet. Highly recommended.
5,McConnell taping...,I bought this to use in my training room for an athlete that needs a McConnell taping... It is perfect for it!
5,Great athletic tape,My PT recommended this tape for my recently operated knee. Along with the Leukotape Cover Roll it even stays on in the pool while I swim. No other tape does that. Anneg
5,great stuff,"great stuff. thanks. just wish I could get it in the stores like I did overseas, but getting it here worked well too."
5,Great for foot problems.,"As runner, have had many foot and ankle injuries over years. My therapist used this tape for my recent experience with Plantar Fascitis-yike-and this really supported my foot. I still use it if my foot gets sore or when I am on my feet for long time. Holds support, doesn't breakdown when taped for several days."
5,Very good!!,I have both knees injured 11 years ago. I got removal surgery for meniscus cartridges. This tape is rigid enough to support your knees even when you exercise like playing tennis.
3,Horrific allergic reaction to skin on foot.,"This product is not safe if you have any type of latex allergy no matter how minimal. This is super strong adhesive tape that caused a severe allergic reaction to my foot. I couldn't walk for about a week because of this stuff.That being said, if you do not have any latex allergies, this stuff works awesome if applied correctly."

4,"Click the ""Add to Cart"" button on this book","Well, if you have gotten as far as reading these reviews, you are obviously interested in the subject matter. That being the case, this is a book I believe you will enjoy. The key characters are not what you would expect - they don't fit the mold. The book is not 'same-old, same-old' either; add it to your cart and enjoy it."
3,A good read but not exceptional,"This book is a good read - especially if you play backjack yourself, ever tried learning to count cards, and have ever thought of trying to make a big score doing it. I thought the plot, characters and the moral and ethical themes were interesting. My only issue was that I wish it was better written. It isn't trash but it really does feel like a first time author. Much of the dialog - especially when dealing with the morality or ""lesson learning"" is very unnatural and a little too neat and clean. The chapters that don't deal directly with blackjack weren't that interesting. The book is also quite predictable which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I like the predictability in a book to be more subtle. Luckily, the subject matter interests me and the twists and turns in the main blackjack story line were compelling enough to keep me reading through to the end."
1,Not about blackjack...,"but instead, about religion ,redemption and morality. Misleading to say the least!!"
4,Enjoyed it,"I enjoyed reading my first novel ever where the main character, Raven, is a card counter and card counting itself is central to the story line. Mr. Blackwood is or was a professional BlackJack player, his understanding and knowledge about big time blackjack play is quite evident in the realistic portrayal of his book's characters. As a serious card counter myself, I found Raven's thought process quite similar to how my own thought pattern works in similar situations. While the good vs. evil conflict in ""The Counter"" is timeless, for me, having it play out in the world of blackjack made for an even more pleasurable read."
4,well worth reading,"It's good to know about things that can affect one's life. Cars, house handiwork, insurance, the stock market, etc are some of those things. Our law and confinement apparatus is one of those things, and this book covers it nicely and in a practical way."
3,good info,"the information was good, usable advice. I think the book could have been written with less vulgarity and foul language. It is certainly not pg13."
1,Hogshire watches to much t.v.,"Having worked in corrections for the last 20 years, I find hogshires book better used as a screenplay than a guide for someone soon to be incarcerated.Anyone who has had any contact with the prison system will agree that most of his information has been obtained from watching bad B movies. Granted most of the things that he mentions do happen,but on a much smaller degree than he illustrates. If someone were to take his advice to heart they would be more apt to kill them selves than go through the indignities that he describes. If you find yourself in the possition of possibly going to prison, simply follow the rules of the institution and do your own time. Do not waste your money on this publication, go rent a B grade prison movie,you'll learn more."
1,You are going to want three hours of your life back....,"Nothing but a bunch of twaddle from an author who hates ""the system."" The ""information"" in this book is largely what you can find from any Discovery/ History channel show on the correctional system, (or any state DoJ website for that manner). The author uses ""sources"" at various times, however all sources are completely anonymous which makes their claims laughable and brings into question whether or not they are fiction. There are a couple of moments of humor (teenage boys may laugh at it. and by couple I mean one or two sentences), but for the most part you're getting the authors opinion outside of the information that is readily available from any number of reputable sources. Don't waste your time."
2,"No exaggeration of horrors of prison, but racism ruins book","[The information in this book applies only to men's prisons]. This book is blatantly racist and gives false information about the racial demographics of incarcerated men who rape and incarcerated men who are victims of rape. At the same time, I strongly disagree with a couple of other reviewers who claim that this book exaggerates the horrors of prison life. One does not need to have any particular political viewpoint to acknowledge that U.S. prisons violate human rights on a massive scale. Read any ethnography about prisoners' experiences, or any of the reports by Amnesty International and other groups that specialize in documenting human rights issues. But be warned that the racism in this particular book prevents the author from painting an accurate picture of U.S. men's prisons."
4,Interesting look at Prison Life,"If you ever thought prison was an OK place, then really think again. Despite the author often taking the side of the criminal, even showing how they can at times stand up and abuse their rights, break a law etc ... the portrait of prison is still of a hell on earth, no matter what you do to minimize any problem you may have."
1,Enough!,I wouldnt waste one penny on this and make these greedy parents even more rich. They dont deserve it and they need to get off the gravy train and BE with their kids and stop letting nannies and anyone else raise their kids. Its truly disgusting.
1,Not as good a previous seasons,"I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of this show. Even though Kate would nag sometimes, it seemed like the family had lots of fun and loved each other. By Season 4, the show just seemed so staged. The kids seemed less happy, Kate was always putting Jon down. It is all about free trips and luxry. Just 1 year before we watched the family struggle on long road trips and it was a learning experience. Suddenly it is all limos and handlers for the kids. I watched season 4 to see what happens, but I sure would not want to watch it a second time. The first 2 seasons are fun to look back on andI feel are very re-watchable. Season 4 I feel is not and I feel is not worth the money. I wish they had stopped while they were still likeable."
2,Sadly disappointing downhill fall,"I've been an avid fan of Jon and Kate since season 1. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the first few seasons they (Kate especially) were all about family, being and doing things together. Now, Kate's gone what seems like alot and Jon's home with the kids in alot of the episodes. Or vice versa. It's a shame to see what was a family trying to raise their kids with values taken by dollar signs."
1,Like watching paint dry,"This family is such a sham. Notwithstanding the fact that Jon and Kate are having affairs and won't break up because of the cash cow that the show has become (it should be called Pimp my Sextuplets), this season is one big commercial. No normal family gets to do the quantity of trips and outings they do. I don't begrudge them these things but the show is supposed to be about a normal family, not some made for TV Monkee-esque family that deals with fame- not at least when they are crying ""poor us"" to churches and accepting love offerings and $20/pic of their kids. Save your money for something worthwhile."
2,Not the same family,"I absolutely agree about this show. I used to love watching them in their everday normal life. They all seemed so normal clipping coupons, the kids going to school, the family always doing stuff together close to home. Now since they are famous they are always going on huge expensive trips, buying a super expensive home, and they rarely spend ""family time"" together anymore. It is more like there is a storyline in the newer episodes. It is okay that they have finished their show, they are not the same anymore and I lost interest."
3,Confirmed Episode List,"The first half of season 4 comes on 3 discs:Disc 1:""Boys' Day Out""""Girls' Day Out""""Sextuplets Turn 4""""Korean Dinner""""Sunny Day""""All Aboard""""Heading South""""Wild Horses""Disc 2:""Beach Trip""""July 4th Celebrations""""Kate's Labor Day""""Backyard Campout""""Sight and Sound""""Picture Perfect""""Mr. Mom""Disc 3:""Back to School""""Baseball Game with Daddy""""Hawaii Here We Come""""Legos & Safaris""""Leis & Luaus""""For Better or Worse"""
3,Exploring various mystical views.,"I enjoyed this book, but I didn't think it was really about how to experience God without belief. Many of the belief systems in the world were touched upon in this text. I was inspired to explore Christian Mysticism and Gnosticism more deeply after being introduced to these ideas. I did not find the sections on ESP and transpersonal psychology interesting. I find them both to be weak equivalents to traditional science. Still the book offerred me a lot of food for thought about how man can explore the existence of God."
5,God isn't out there ...,"This wonderful book shows that God isn't out there, but in here. Not up in the heavens, or far away in outer space, or an abstract theological concept, but in here, an intimate experience deep inside the psyche. Is there a way to satisfy our spiritual yearnings without requiring our brains to turn into mush? This book says yes, and shows the way."
1,New Age Nonsense,"Another book that says, ""The real god is you."" We are hardly God. Give me a break. Either there is a god out there, or there is no God. People are not gods."
5,Had to return.,"This product was exactly as describes and arrived very quicklly. Unfortunatly I was unable to use it due to a malfuntion in the product it was supposed to charge. I phoned the company and ask if it was returnable and they were totally agreeable and refunded my money quickly. I've spent thousands of dollars with them on numerous products and this was the only thing that didn't work and they graciously accepted the return. I love working with these people and they're my first go-to company. Great prices, great customer service. 5 STARS....."
5,"A superb, multilcultural, timeless, educational masterpiece","Of the many excellent reviews of this book - starred in PW, for example - why did you choose the Kirkus Review's? The Ledgerbook was supervised, vetted and blessed by Arthur Amiotte, a Sioux Elder, with more credentials than you can count. A leading advocate of the power of education, Mr. Amiotte 's approval of and great delight in the authenticity of this book has obviously been overlooked in the KR reviewer's research. Throughout the entire country, this book has been cited again and again by educators and parents alike as being the most powerful, interactive teaching tool they've come across in years, not to mention being an extraordinry feast for the eyes. Please research your reviews before choosing the one that will (incorrectly in this case) represent the book to your many readers. Subjecting an extraordinary book to bad PR out of ignorance should be beneath you"
3,Best seller for a reason,"This is a top seller for a reason - it's highly essential for any writer. What it does not help with is screenwriting, which you can learn about from [...]"
4,Fast Delivery,"I honestly don't know anything about this book.I bought for my daughter who needed it for college.It's easier to buy textbooks from Amazon.The price was right, but the shipping cost half asmuch as the book. I don't blame the vendor,but the cost of shipping didn't help."
4,"Grammar and usage in a practical, readable, nutshell.","If you're tired of making the same old grammatical errors, but cringe at the idea of going through that 300 page textbook you avoided like a dentist's appointment in college, rejoice: Strunk's little book fits in your pocket, and you can read it in one sitting. What's more, it makes sense and instructs with minimal grammarian jargon, so you won't have to jot down any funny-looking equations on your hands, create acronyms, or memorize it like a secret formula. Simply put, Elements of Style is the perfect solution for writers who want to improve their writing, but spare their minds."
5,Remains a Classic,"I used this book in college any years ago. As a Corporate Trainer, I recently taught a class on Business Writing and gave this book to the students. They loved it. An easy reference, full of excellent information. Should be on everyone's office desk."
5,Excellent Reference...,This is the best investment I've ever made. This should be required reading for everyone.
3,Style,"Strunk and White's book on style is small and to the point. The elements of style discussed are not necessarily applicable to modern creative writing. This book, no doubt, is helpful for writing formally-- such as formal essays, articals, and such. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because writing can be an art form as well as a tool, and for the most part this book treats it as a tool."
4,amazon made it easy,this was a black and white film that was a hard to find movie. But I needed it for a school assignment. Amazon made it easy to get. And worth watching.
5,Absolutely Outstanding Book for Anyone Who Writes,"I found this little jewell to be an book that I keep by my side when I am writing. The authors present a clear explanation of the many mistakes people make in word selection when writing in English. It has been out for years, and still is a relevant tool. Examples include grammar, punctuation, parts of speech, the importance of active voice rather than passive voice, and nuances of meanings of many similar English words. You will learn to distinguish restrictive and non restrictive clauses and many other gems of wisdom about careful word selections to make your writing clear and bold. I strongly recomment it!"
5,Also available free online,"Excellent book, worth purchasing. Those wishing to give it a test run should read it online on bartleby.com."
1,It was Just Too Simplistic,"Based on reviews I read, I eagerly obtained a copy of this book. When I got home and perused it, I was vastly disappointed it didn't measure up to all its hype. Why? It is too simplistic! When looking for information regarding numerals, all it carries is a small paragraph about numerals in dates. I was also looking for uses of the apostrophe. Again, it only contains very limited data. In continuing to look through this book, I have not found a single answer to my questions!A person who already has style basics under their hat should not spend their money on this book. Instead, they should gravitate towards a larger style manual, which gives much more detailed information. That is what I have done. Many of these are available."
2,"Simplistic and ""write by numbers""","I didn't find this book very useful at all. The rules and rules of what is correct writing just didn't help me. It is good to know rules, but the inflexible manner of this book was not very useful. For instance, some books have to be grammatically incorrect. Sentence fragments, run-on sentences, etc. all can build tension or a feeling in a book, but this isn't allowed according to Strunk and White. A decent book at giving the fundamentals of style, but not one to slavishly ape."
2,Book was ok,the condition of the book was good and the size is great because is so small that you can put it anywere. The examples are good for learning how to write sentences.
3,For the english major,"If you are an English major or playwrite, maybe this book is for you, but if you just need a book to suggest ways to draft letters to corporate america, I think you can find smaller and better directed information."
2,worth SKIMMING - but don't take it too seriously!,"e.b. white was one of my favorite authors when i was a kid, but i dunno, something just tells me that he should have stuck to being a great novelist. this is a nerd-book, mildly toxic for the obsessive-compulsive within us all.after reading it (and skimming parts), i came to the conclusion that while much of what they said has its merit (as i too get peeved when a book or article uses poor style), this book is really not that important. it's the heart of a book that counts, and many a great heart has faulty valves and cholesterol deposits. take gandhi's autobiography: stylistically deadly, but a heart of gold within. granted, a strunk-and-whiter could have edited it up a few notches, but it would have been the same book deep within.my final take: buy this book if it's in the dollar bin, and skim if you have a spare hour. but if writing's in your blood, strunk and white won't make much of a difference."
4,A must read for writers,"This book is a must have. Easy to read and full of simple but important advices. It works within days! With little effort, I already simplified and improved my English writing. It has gained in readability and efficiency. It's a good book to begin with, even - or particularly - for non native speakers.4 out 5 because perfection is for gods! (:-)"
4,A very good tool,"This book is an excellent tool for those who want to learn in a practical way the essentials of writing. Whether you write for science, art, or any other area of investigation; this book will help you giving tips and showing with detailed examples the most common situations while you write. I recommend the book to those who want writing as a way of expressing their ideas and to those who are not conformists and like to go further in life.This book is: Easy to read, practical, and helpful."
3,Be careful which edition you order!!,I ordered the July 2009 paperback edition (it has a quill on the front) because it was cheaper than the others. BEWARE- it is not the same as the others! It has only half of the information that the others have... it's only Strunk without the White. If you want the real version make sure it says that it's by Strunk AND White.
5,To plonk or not to plonk...that is the question,"If you're used previous editions of this book and are debating if the price of a version upgrade is worth it, a short answer is Yes! This edition is sufficiently revised to justify its price, and the binding is good enough not to justify the hardback version. For any person who writes for a living, this is that little gem that is as always short and sweet to refer to. Unlike the Chicago Manual of Style, it is also a little easier to get off your shelf more frequently!"
5,very good book,"I love this book,it is good quality and nice writing. I can learn a lot from this book. i recommend this book"
4,SW,"There's not to much to be said about The Elements of Style. It's a strongly written style and grammar guide that can be a bit outdated at times, but the writing's so strong you kinda wanna be outdated."
2,good for the insider,"Strunk and White, Elements of Style has an excellent reputation as a classic in the field of basic grammar and composition. However, I found that the tone and composition of the book lends itself to an audience of insiders,' those who are already well-versed in the basic principles. It is not of much use in teaching those who are confused or need more clarity on the subject. Furthermore, the tone of the book is rather haughty and elitist, which was a turn-off for me. As someone with a strong English background, I can use the book and learn from it. But I would not recommend it to a student of the language."
3,Grammar Fans Rejoice Whilst the Rest of Us Get on With Writing,"Following artificial rules of grammar have never been my forte. When writing for pedantics this book is probably a godsend. Yet, because I'm involved in academia, especially with philosophy and history where we constantly see how languages adapt and change over years, I just don't see the point in getting all up-tight about someone ""breaking"" arbitrary rules. Geoffrey K. Pullum has a better critique than I could ever come up with: [...]The Good:Satisfies grammar Nazis and formalists who are more concerned with rules than content.The Bad:Stifles free thought and creativity, horrible for people who actually use language for a living."
4,The Elements of Style,"As an author, I struggle with my style of writing to gain an oridance. this book was suggested to me by me Editor, and an instructor from a grammer free proof reading class I took. It has put great perspective on how I should write."
4,Basic but useful,"A copy of this book should be in every writer's library.Experienced writers will find much of what is in this small book to be redundant. Even so, this book is a very useful resource. I keep a copy nearby all the time and skim for reminders and tidbits of information that I either did not know, or had forgotten."
5,Style book,The Elements of Style provides incredible insight into English expression while using simple terms and instructions.
4,"The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition is a valuable resource for the business writer","In this modern age of e-mail, the written word has risen to become, in many cases, the most vital ""image product"" provided by a company. In many instances, customers determine whom their suppliers will be solely based on written communication. Ambiguity and errors found in written documents convey an unprofessional image.The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition will help guide your decisions when you are faced with questions related to diction, writing style, and punctuation. In short, this book will help you become a better business writer and project a more professional image."
3,OK as Far as It Goes,"I know this book has its devoted followers who swear it's essential for the act of writing but to me it feels like an ad hoc collection of do's and don'ts which may help you polish up a few details of your writing but won't teach you the basics of how to write clearly. There may be some useful substance in there somewhere, but I don't find the presentation to be very engaging and I've found other, more recent books that, for me, are better: for instance, ""Style"" by Williams and ""Rhetorical Grammar"" by Kolln. These books are influenced by currents in linguisitcs developed since Strunk and White, they center on the idea that ""norms"" can vary based on functional needs, and they promote analysis and exercise of judgment rather than sweeping, universal stylistic rules.Strunk and White may have some value as a reference tool in the editing process, it doesn't cost much, and it certainly won't do you any harm, so you might as well buy it; but it doesn't strike me as indispensible."
5,Strunk and White provide affortable excellence,"William Strunk and E.B. White wrote an inexpensive book of excellent advice for workers with words. It includes tips as simple as ""omit needless words"" and reminds readers about usage, such as the difference between 'lie' and 'lay'. Well worth rereading in almost any edition!"
4,Elements of Style Review,This book is very useful for someone who is taking an AP English course or anyone who just wants to learn how to write properly.
4,The Elements of Style,I was pleased with the condition of the used book and the price. It's for a Creative Writing Workshop that I will be leading in January and I wanted to have a copy to show how cheap one could get resource materials from Amazon!! $1.92 plus shipping!! Thanks for the opportunity for good books at inexpensive prices. Veda
5,This Little Thing?,"It's under a hundred pages. The bulk of the text is nearly seventy years old. But after all this time, it's still a priceless, must-have reference.If you're a writer of any kind - student, novelist, journalist, poet, technical writer, graffiti artist, you name it - You need a copy of Strunk and White. No book this small (and not many larger) cover as much ground as well as this little volume does. Usage, form, misused words and expressions, style...it's all here. But if you think this is some stuffy textbook written by a couple of old coots sitting in an ivory tower, you couldn't be more wrong. The rules and examples are clear and easy to understand. I don't know of a more practical book that can be used by everyone from grade school students to PhD's. The book has instructed AND entertained for nearly seventy years. May it last for another seventy and beyond.92 pages"
5,coming back to it from afar,"Well. This is a masterpiece. Buy it, assign it if you can, but do read it. I opened it up recently in a colleague's office, and within the first three rules fell back in love with it.But beware. For instance, the previous reviewer has some pretty large comma errors in his/her prose. I guess this text could also be a cause to believe you don't really need a basic English composition course. It isn't."
5,The definitive guide to writing and grammar,"When I picked up Stephen King's book ""On Writing,"" the first thing I noticed was his praise of ""Elements of Style."" Fabulous! I have something in common with a world-famous author. To paraphrase, he says most books about writing are nonsense, the one exception being ""Elements of Style."" That is certainly true.This book is an authority on grammar. Entries on confused words, punctuation, verb conjugation, etc. give writers and editors all the rules they need to be good at what they do. Lessons on style, clarity and good writing help rid writing of plodding or confusing material.This is not a long book to slog through once; it is a wonderfully short book to be used as a reference all the time. What more could you ask for?"
5,Needed More Than Ever!,"Attitude? The only attitude found in this book is an undying sympathy for the poor reader. In an age when books are pumped out faster than one can read them, THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE is needed more than ever. ELEMENTS is not a grammar book? Hmm. I must've missed part 1, ""The Elementary Rules of Usage."" The fact is, you'll be hard pressed to find a publisher or a professional writer anywhere who does not give this book a whole-hearted endorsement. I've been a writer for 27 years and in all that time THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE has been at the top of every ""must have"" list of books for writers. Buy it. Read it. And read it often!"
4,To The Point,"I picked this up on the reccomendation of Stephen King when reading his excellent ""On Writing."" Mr. King was so impressed with ""Elements..."" that he suggested that all writers should read it, and he did this on a page that was solely dedicated to this purpose. High praise from a man who should know a thing or two about writing; wouldn't you say?Strunk's book cuts throught the chase and quickly points out common errors in writing. Examples are provided of good and bad writing. You'll learn puctuation techniques that are necessary for communicating your words effectively.Mr. King was right; you need this."
5,Indispensable tool for writer - Less is more,"Some write short sentence, others long. This book is not mean to alter your style, it helps to remove redundancies, ambiguities and shows writer to get to the point in a concise manner. It is around for many decades, and still the de facto of the subject. The book shows writer the building block of writing -- a sentence, and it does a great job. Many professional writers need to read this book to make their book thinner and more readable. It is a classics.If you need one book to clarify or organize thoughts into words, this is the one."
4,I really liked the packaging from these ppl,"It was very eco friendly packaging and it came FAST!Thanks! the hardcover wads a great choice! Recommend highly, thanks"
3,Ok grammar guide,"With so many other grammar guides out there, this one is very simple in its rather rigid guidelines. It might be good for beginner writers who are fluent in English, but I wouldn't recommend this book to students since this book is very dated. It's considered a classic for grammer, but I find this book to be overrated. I prefer to have an other grammar guide than this one. Some of the rules used in here are rather old fashioned. The writing is very stiff and forced. Personally I prefer other grammar guides over this one, but this one good for reference."
5,The Little Book That Packs Quite a Wallop,"This book's small size is representative of its content: ""Short and sweet."" (My kind of reference book) Strunk is a no-frills kind of guy, and this is demonstrated in this concise, but powerful treatment of writing style. I advise any writer, technical or not, to obtain a copy of this one. Because of it's valuable content and low price, it's one of the best bargains around."
4,Great Reference,"This book is a great reference. I use it often when writing. It can be read cover to cover, but after that you will use it as a reference."
4,Get the 3rd Edition,"The second edition of this classic work improved on the first edition, and the third was the best of all. It was perfection. The fourth, posthumous edition slips a little bit. It's still better than any other style guide, but a hint of Political Correctness has crept into some of its advice and examples. Why did the publishers feel the need to tinker with perfection? If you already have the third edition, don't bother getting the new one. If you don't have any copies of this great book, check the used bookstores for the previous edition."
5,"Read it, Then Read It Again","This itsy bitsy tome is an ageless classic. I read it for the first time 20 years ago. Despite having never found grammar interesting before, I became hooked on the sharp little lessons. I read it again, to both delight and edification. And I'll read it once more, to remind myself of the rules that make English what it is and to smile at Prof. Strunk, long gone but very much alive in these pugnacious 80 pages. He's somehow managed to boil down the bones of the language and give you the absolute essentials. If you haven't read it, you're in for a treat and a pleasant surprise, especially if you don't care for grammar. This is truly short and sweet."
5,Strunk & White - still the best resource for writers,"This small classic book tells us what every literate person should know about writing well. It consists of guidelines about punctuation, word choice, and grammar, for example, and is written with clarity and wit. It's greatest virtue is its humor."
1,"Outdated, obsolete, and wasn't very good when it was released","Serious composition teachers no longer use this book. Many of the prescriptive imperatives within its pages are vague, arbitrary, or flat-out wrong.Students don't learn to write by flipping through a style guide while writing papers."
1,A Rotten Little Book,"I suppose that this book might be of some use as an antidote for semi-literate Americans who've read one too many articles by William F. Buckley and decided that they'd like to posess his ""eloquence."" But for anyone who thinks that written English should aspire to beauty rather than mere functionality, it's about 100 pages of the worst imaginable sanctimonius claptrap, pressed between two glossy little covers."
1,Elementally Unpalatable,"This is a very poor book on grammar. While it is probably written correctly, it is simply not accessible to the general public. I threw out my copy of Strunk and White many years ago. It was hard to follow, complicated, and written in a ""style"" that was very Cornell Academic! Sure, we can look at it as a relic in the history of English writing, but just don't try to use it as a desk reference book!(By the way, I replaced my copy with the St. Martin's Handbook)"
4,great reference,"The third edition works just fine. If you already have the third edition, you're OK. IF you don't have any edition, get this book. It's a great reference to have..."
5,less is more,"So far I have given ""The Elements of Style"" as a gift to at least six friends and colleagues. If a writer has only one 'how-to' grammar and style book, it should be this one. I just placed an order for three more copies so I have extras on hand to give friends in need. ""Elements"" and a pocket bible are two books I never leave home without; there is something in them for everyone."
5,Good writing tool,"This book is a very useful book. It will help you in your writing with grammatical problems, sentence structures, format, etc. It is nicely set up and easy to use. Good book for any student - even in college!"
5,Classic - must have book!,"This is a classic, must have book for anyone who writes anything! One of the most longstanding and venerable books about the specifics of writing."
5,Priceless,"If you need to learn how to write, this book is for you. Well-written and compact, ""Elements of Style"" gives you all you need to know to speak and write clearly and simply. I have had a copy of this book since my senior year in high school (I'm now 30). We can all benefit from solid writing advice and this book accomplishes just that! I LOVE the fact that it's not a 900-page book. At roughly 100 pages, it is small enough to throw into a briefcase for ready-reference."
5,Very enjoyable read about food and feasting in Tudor times!,"As a serving wench in the King's Feast Hall at the Texas Renaissance Faire, I am asked all sorts of questions about the food, the utensils, the beverages, and anything having to do with food and feasting during King Henry VIII's time. ""Food and Feast in Tudor England"" is not only enjoyable to read (i.e. more than just a dry recitation of the facts), but highly informative as well. Each chapter covers a various aspect such as Food and Society in the 16th Century, Kitchens and Kitchen Equipment, Health and Diet, and Tableware to name a few. As with her other books, Alison Sim has written this book in an interesting, informative, easy-to-digest manner. In addition to knowledge for knowledge's sake, this book is a must-have for anyone involved in Tudor/Renaissance role-playing. When I answer the feast hall patrons' questions, I will be giving them facts and not something made-up!"
3,Sunbeam,"The Sunbeam is not the best iron on the market, but it looks nice. It requires water to get hot and then you will have to turn it to the proper fabric level to get some results. It is not a plug and go iron, it requires attention. However, it is safe for a home with children, since is cools itself down when not in use and it is never to hot for the touch. The iron will shut itself off if you leave it a few minutes, so it has its own brain. Therefore, if you have children I would suggest you purchase this very safe iron, but expect to work at ironing your clothes."
4,Rankin Redux,"This is exactly the same book as ""Creative Lighting for Outdoor Living""; only the title has been changed. There is something vaguely suspicious about re-titling the same text and illustrations to lure the unwary into a second purchase. That said, my earlier review stands but my opinion of Lark Books has taken a fall."
5,Real good starting point,"If you are looking for a good understanding of what Druidry is, this is the book for you. Although I found the writer at times to be somewhat 'imaginative', it is none the less an excellent book. I recommend for the novice and inquiring minds."
5,Wine stopper,"This acrylic wine bottle stopper is the best I've ever had. I've used them for years, given them as gifts, and can't live without them. They are practical, pretty, and work for the purpose they're intended."
2,Plastic,This product is very light and feels like plastic. It feels and looks a lot cheaper than the picture online.
2,Not good,It is my first and last buying this product.Pros: Nice brush and packagingCons: No significant volume or length
4,A very good book,"Very well written, very straight-forward and enlightening. This book does a very good job of allowing men to peek into the mind of a woman and see what goes on there. For any man who is interested in wanting to know how a woman's mind works, this is the book for you."
3,So-So,"Decent info but presented in a casual, (sometimes corny), way. Very light compared to ""For Women Only"", which I'd highly recommend."
5,For All Men Only,Wish someone would have given this to me 19 years ago in my first year of marriage. I ordered 10 copies to give away.
5,"Now this, this is good","The Feldham's have struck all the right cords, hit the right buttons and knocked one out of the park for men in ""For Men Only."" A book that simply (if that is possible) helps the neanderthal in every man realize we actually CAN understand our wives. A little.Whether it is the way she thinks (which is crazy how she can juggle so much at one time) to her views on sex (yep we are clueless) to her need to be heard, reassured and know that she still drives you wild. The quote form David Robinson (yes, that David Robinson hall of fame NBA player) that he is willing to be rude to other women because ""if any woman is going to get her feelings hurt, it's not going to be my wife,"" totally knocked me over the head with my responsibility to her.This is a great book that, men, you should read only if you desire to strengthen your love an relationship with your wife."
1,Disappointed,"After all the stellar reviews I thought the information would be useful to me. I wish I'd known the focus group demographics that were relied upon. The lack of intimacy implied for the respective relationships is very sad.Unfortunately, I didn't learn anything enlightening. And, know I'm not a playboy, player type guy either. In fairness I feel the material would be appropriate for a junior high school lad or someone who's been in prison for twenty years.It is presented and read very nicely though."
2,common knowledge,"This book was a waste of my time and money. The things in this book should be common knowledge. If you are not aware of these common difference between men and women, then you might like it."
2,Here we go again...,"Is it really necessary to have yet ANOTHER book telling men how to try and please the women in their lives? Why must a man spend his life walking on eggshells around women, desperately trying to ""understand"" her feelings? At some point, even a dog wearies of chasing his tail and gives up.The point never mentioned in this book (or others like it) is that even if a man successfully makes his wife happy, tomorrow is another day, and all of your past efforts are forgotten in an instant. It's a constant battle, and one that is never won. A married man is always at the mercy of a woman's often violent mood swings, and can never win. Then, God forbid, comes menopause. Ah, the romantic stuff of dreams.......This book might be useful for women, in that it will re-affirm their belief that everything really is the fault of MAN, yet it will do little for the male reader except re-affirm that he has an endless and thankless chore ahead of him."
2,Not Bad,"Apologies for the short review, since my name is attached to the review, I'd rather not expound on why it gets 2/5."
5,For Men Only: A Straightforward Guide to the Inner Lives of Women,Outstanding! Very helpful. Recommend to any man who wants to know and love that special woman in his life.
1,Where's the Book,"I never received the book. Emailed the company, and they emailed me back. Told me to wait a couple of days. Still no book. Said they would forward my message to Amazon for a refund. Still waiting for Amazon to contact me."
2,It doesn't give all the answers such as...,"1. How to be clever enough not to marry at all ? (People told me: ""Don't do it"", but I tought I was clever...)2. When you are married how to get rid of her with minimum of negative effects to the child and minimum costs.Problem: This book would like that you think that you can have happy marriage with women = sorry, it's impossible, but if you want ... well, keep on trying, (ha,ha, ha, ...)"
5,Perfect Wedding Book!,"Ok, so I admit that I read some of my husband's book titled ""For Men Only"". It's his own fault for leaving it next to the toilet.We received these as wedding gifts awhile back. I was really curious to see if what it said was true. I have to say that it actually provided some great insight into my own thoughts and feelings and legitimized my feelings for certain issues that have arisen in our relationship. I'd have to say that in my opinion this is a great book to help men understand the average woman. Men, if you've ever thought ""That girl is ka-razy!"", then this is the book for you!Two thumbs up!"
3,Something to be read with your significant other,"My husband and I did the for women only, for men only, in a Bible study. There were several points in the book (I read along with him) where I felt the need to tell my husband ""This is NOT how I feel, do NOT do this."" and he felt the same for me. I think it is EXTREMELY important to read the books together and then discuss with your spouse. I know my husband was very nervous I was going to start walking around on eggshells trying to ""respect"" him all the time, thinking there were problems where there really were none.Personally I didn't find any of the information earth shattering. I've heard it all discussed and studied it before in other books. Not really necessary if you already have good communication skills and an open relationship with your spouse. Overall I found the study incredibly boring."
5,An excellent perspective supported with real data,"The book was easy reading and was well organized. It stayed directly on the point and supported most of its conclusions with survey data rather than just one person's opinion. This book kept a good style of not just stating problems or telling stories of counseling sessions, but instead it gives clear methods of how to address the most common issues."
4,This should be required reading in high school and college!,"This book was very easy to listen to and kept my attention throughout. The content was right on. Although the authors have a Christian slant to their views, their ideology is not overwhelming or pushy. I want all my male friends to listen or read this book. Along with its companion book, For Women Only, I believe more than a few marriages can be saved."
4,Good read with some useful information.,"The book seems to really break down how women think and what they want. I have to admit that some things have worked really well.Other theories did not seem to mesh up with my wife. That may be because she is one of the exceptions to the rule.Overall, it is a good book and worth the time."
5,great book,there is even a quick referance guide at the front for men that don't want to read a lot. Ha! i've given this as a gift paired with the one for women about ment and I've always gotten really good feedback for it
5,Husband Must Read,"I read For Women Only while my Husband read For Men Only together at bedtime. It was a must read for both of us and has made a huge difference in our relationship. We were both shocked by some of the things we read about the opposite sex, but now we understand each other better. We actually understand why we do what we do and how to relate."
4,Men Are Hopeless,"This is actually not a bad book. It was given to me by a friend right as I got married. It contains pearls of wisdom about how women should be treated and what they look for. Much of it is common sense but other parts are less intuitive for men. Women just think about some things differently.The book does a pretty fair job of pointing out pitfalls and common misconceptions. It even points out that women have many similar problems dealing with and understanding men. I could not help coming away with the conclusion, however, that men must deal with female misconceptions by adapting themselves and that women must deal with male misconceptions by having their men adapt themselves. Its not quite that stark but almost.Still, this book has its place and will help many of us burdened with a Y chromosome to realize where we so often go wrong."
4,Very Helpful,"48 days before my wedding this book has just helped me amazingly! I'm a better man and I'm growing, so I can be a better Husband. Really good literature that was written extremely correct and in a very easy way for people to understand the authors points. excellent and informative""Yahhhhh"" for a good book"
3,Good for Group Discussions,"This is a small, hard cover book that repeats what ever other ""christian"" help-me-understand-woman book has to say.This husband & wife team have written a companion book for women called, For Women Only which tells women how to understand men. (That book is much smaller than this one...)Inside the flap, you'll find a ""Quick Start Guide"" which explains the six keys to understanding a woman. These keys are:Reassurance, Emotions, Security, Listening, Sex, and Beauty. This quick guide bullets out the Why she does, Here's why and What to do questions that the book fleshes out.This book may be a good resource for a men's small group or book club but I didn't read anything new or insightful that I haven't heard/read in any other ""gender help"" book.This book was provided for review, at no cost, by WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing."
3,"How to answer the question ""Does this dress make me look fat?""","I can't say this is the best written book, nor is it even the best in the 'self-help' category, but it was worth a quick perusal if only to confirm my feelings - I'm a perfectly normal woman! Yes, I need to feel loved. Yes, I'm emotional! Yes, I'll give up financial security to feel loved. No, I don't want you to fix it, but just to listen. Yes, I need to feel attractive to you and then maybe, just maybe, you'll get lucky and get some.So, if you ever wondered what the proper answer to ""Does this dress make me look fat?"", pick up a copy of this book."
3,Some helpful gems,"""For Men Only"" by Shaunti and Jeff Feldhahn. The order of the author names says a lot--For Women Only was written first and the men's version seems a bit less original, more cookie cutter, and meant to parallel the women's version. The material found within For Men Only is not enough to teach an eight week class but definitely enough to teach a 2 hour seminar. There are some helpful gems in For Men Only. Some of the chapters are more culture driven than biblically focused; e.g., ""The Girl in the Mirror"". The For Women Only book has an accompanying video series put out by LifeWay, For Men Only does not."
5,A Funnier Series Never Existed,"""Trust Me, I know what I'm doing.""Sledge Hammer is one of those ""renegade, rogue"" detectives who's police work is a little unothrodoxed by today's standard's. He talks to his ""amigo"" -- his ivory handled revolver, gives his cheif -- Captian Trunk -- frequent migraines, and is a handful for his partner, Det. Doree Doro. This series was one of the best of the 1980's, very politically incorrect by today's standards but is a series I'd highly reccommend to anybody with an open mind and a sense of humor.""All Shook Up"" as you can guess, deals with a homicide revolving around Elvis Impersonators."
3,inspirational frontier romance!,"Growing up on the Kansas prairie, Samantha Martin cherished two desires: to love God and marry her childhood sweetheart. But the War between the States took nearly everything--her family, her home, and Nathan her love. When he returns six years later, she is shocked to discover he's no longer the gentle boy she's always adored. Instead, he is a physically and emotionally scarred man on the run, dodging charges of theft...and murder.Nathan Hamilton once dreamed of seeing the world, becoming a doctor, and making Samantha his bride. But instead of adventure, he encountered tragedy and made choices that nearly destroyed his life. Now, in Samantha's arms, Nathan seeks peace and freedom--while she strives to lead him from darkness to light and into the embrace of the only one who can provide a true refuge for The Fugitive Heart."
3,Strong Frontier Setting,"This book paints a realistic life of frontier struggles. It's gritty, sometimes violent. The heroine meets obstacles with incredible bravery. The novel honors family and faith, instead of glorifying gunfighters, and that's a wonderful change of pace.At times, however, Samantha was too good to be true. Instead of feeling angry with Caleb, which would've been natural, she felt guilty for doubting him.Also, I couldn't believe how far Nathan had fallen from his faith. Sure, his experiences during the Civil War would make anyone bitter, but I couldn't accept that he'd become a sarcastic outlaw who smoked, drank, and robbed banks. He seemed too intelligent to succumb to those things. His growth and redemption, however, was very believable.I gave this book a C at All About Romance."
5,NewOrderROCKS!,Crystal completely surprised me when I first heard it. I've been partial to the dancey side of NO since Blue Monday but Crystal changed that. It ROCKS and they sound GREAT!
3,Flip top soft top,"Reasonably priced. Fitting a bit off on my 1980 CJ7. No access to rear from outside when top is on, can only open back door from inside. looks a bit odd when flip top is open, does not lay properly. Excellent product for the price though. i really can't complain because it looks great and it was what I could afford. i hope to enjoy the flip top even though it lays a little weird."
1,sucks!,"i have 38, no more kids please, UP ALL NIGHT PILOT sucks for me!is not for me, is not cool, i don't understand why make a series : my kid make number 1 or number 2?"
3,Amusing,"This is a good series to watch as a stress reliever. Light and funny, Christina Applegate plays a great role. The entire series is well cast."
4,Just what we needed!,This ball was just what we needed! Our guests can use this volleyball on the sand court or in the pool.
2,Doesn't Look New,"It just doesn't look new (even though it is in the original packaging). It is dirty and the seams are of poor quality, like they will come apart easily. Not happy with the quality of this item - not sure if it was made this poorly or if it was damaged in shipping."
5,Great for water volleyball!,"This ball is great to play water volleyball with! Doesn't hurt when you spike it, or get hit with it and doesn't get affected by water at all"
5,My daughter loves this volleyball,My daughter is so into volleyball and pink this was a wonderful thing for her. She even took it to school and they used it at volleyball practice.
2,"It's a ball, but it looks used","The ball came in just a couple of days. But it looks like it has been used by the Olympic Beach Volleyball team. Or, maybe, the hardcourt pro-team. The ball was scuffed and smudged in black all over it. I am extremely unimpressed with its appearance. I would like to get my money back."
1,This is NOT a volleyball,"This is just a plastic ball. The kind they sell in supermarkets for little kids. If you're looking for a soft volleyball, look elsewhere."
5,we think its great...,Its very easy on the hands and wrists. Definately not a regulation volley ball. Its perfect for the casual use we bought it for. A day at the park with friends bouncing the ball back and forth. I dont think that its cheaply made. Its just as advertised. We are happy with it.
1,"Poor quality, won't last a season","I bought this ball for the kids to play in the pool. It lasted about 6 weeks, after which one of the seams split and the rubber belly popped out. The store clerk at Dick's where I bought it refused to accept it for return, claiming it was overinflated, but in fact I hadn't added any air in it since I bought it."
1,not for outdoor,Do not use outdoors.. I did not notice that warning... holes in the ball after about 10 uses.
5,Hiphop Revolutionary,"Ruminations is eye opening & consciousness expanding. He discusses some concepts that I've thought about before and some that I never would have. He lays out plans for a sovereign Hiphop Nation that would stand indepent of the United States. Talk about revolutionary thinking! As always he's not afraid to put forth ideas that may not be popular. I highly recommend this book, really for everybody, but especially for anyone who cares about Hiphop Kulture or even just Rap. The last chapter is The Science of Rap, apparently updated and reprinted from an earlier KRS book.I couldn't put this book down. I often get bored with books before finishing them, but not this one."
4,Great Read!,"This is a wonderful read! This will be a great text book for college classes interested in inner-city thought as well as social philosophy.There's a reason KRS ONE has lectured at Harvard and Yale, and there's a reason this book is introduced by a famous philosopher. It's a good book with many insights.It's no Plato's Republic, but if Plato grew up in the South Bronx and climbed the ladder from rags to riches, this book is something he may have written."
1,KRS Zero,"A book of lies... Look online for reviews of his recent shows. He's voted one of the most dissapointing acts, not to mention, listen to his last 3 or four albums. CRAP. KRS1 aka the Preacher needs to lay off the coke and turn down the sound at his shows and quit acting so self-righteous. Spiritual minded?! I guess you get to that level if you snort enough blow. I've seen him before, and the whole crowd wanted their money back. You can turn down your sytem Kris. No one's listening anymore. Quit trying to get all mainstream. Haven't you made enough money? cuz now you're just stealing it from your old fans who are hoping that maybe you'll put out a dope joint. I got all your new cd's, and they went to the trash along with your career. Sincerely, someone who truly cares about hip-hop. Peace"
2,A disappointment,"Basically this kit is an unnecessarily big box containing a lot less than you'd think. It consists of a dozen heavy-weight coloring pages with not very attractive fashion drawings along with packs of sequins, ribbons, and fabric pieces that your child can glue or tape on. In other words, stuff that all of us with girls have in our houses. I'm sorry I spent my money."
2,"Just cut and paste craft, no design, poor drawing templets.","My daughter loves to design clothes not just glue sequins on some drawing of a native, or space queen. Not appropriate for girls who have a flair for being creative."
1,cheap cheap...,"This frame along with many other cheap metal frames that look similar. are exactly that. CHEAP. they work good for a room that will not see much traffic.. or for temporary use with intent to toss it afterwards. the metal is very thin, the welds are minimal, and the supports are not that great. The mattress that normally comes with these is about 2inch thick and feels every bit of it.The Elite 35-4914-050 is another one of these CHEAP products."
1,Not so good,"Not much to say about this. Cheap card, horribly basic and clunky software and drivers (with no updates). Never have been able to get the remote to work more than about 1 foot away from the receiver. I would definitely pass on this one folks."
3,Chinese adware?,"After intalling the tuner software (Card and drivers are from China). I now get chinese popups in IE. So much so, that I can no longer use IE and use Firefox instead now."
3,SBT-TVFM Tuner/Video Card,"I can't really say much about this product because it could not be mounted in my small form factory computer. I had to return it, forever if i get a chance to use it in the future i will make a better review."
4,I'ts ok,This works for ps2 and xbox 360's though getting the audio to work is a little tricky like almost everyone else in the reviews has been saying. iv'e recorded shows with this i give the video quality a 7/10 the audio when you get it to work is a 8 1/2 out of 10 i think it sounds pretty good over all it was worth the 20 bucks i paid for it i got mines used.
2,works...minimally,"Pros- picture quality is decent and setup was quickCons- Remote did not work, software volume controls do not work. Sound emits a high pitched tone"
2,Marginal,The unit itself works fine but the remote does not work at all. Owners manual is useless. Did not contact Amazon about the problem...went straight to the company. Recieved no response from the company.
2,FM Radio works but every other feature does not,"This product is cheap so I cant expect much, sound works, video is black and white ONLY and the quality is almost as good as a tv from 1940s, FM radio works well and the installation is fairly easy but Tuner software is terrible, remote control does not work at all. I tried everything to get it to work properly but..........Stay away from this product add some more money and get a proper tv tuner, you get what you pay for.actually, you dont always get what you pay for, FM- the only feature that worked should not cost 20$"
3,Works for my application,All I wanted to do was to be able to see my Security cams. It did that just fine. I could not get it to work with the Honestech TVR driver for Win 2000xp. I took a chance and installed the TV expert for Vista and it worked fine. I still can't use the remote for some reason. FM does not work with TV expert. [...] I'm happy and do not need FM since its streaming over the web right now.CheersWopr
5,Good product,"I was iffy on buying a used product, I was needing to get a camera I had with an RCA connection working on my computer, worked great, didn't try the tv tuner software, just needed the drivers and the software I was using picked it up just fine :)"
