4,Lite-On DVD Burner,"I got this item approx,3 weeks ago and it is working great. I think it is the best deal with that much money."
4,morbius light scribe 20x,"Drive was easy to install except for the that no power adapter was included which then had to be ordered, and subsequenty installed. After installation some software had to be downloaded, but some was downloaded on a TRIAL basis and had to be paid for later. To me, all software should have been included free. I now have to put out more money to get the drive fully functional. Buggers!"
1,Bad choice!,"first, this was not the model I asked for, decided to keep It since I was told that this model was better than the one they used to have. This product came with nero 9. I been through hell trying to set It up on my dell desktop, I,M STILL ON IT!"
5,The perfect unit!,"This unit is the perfect DVD reader/writer out there. It reads/write any format existing, have lightscribe support and it's sata! Just perfect, really quick making a burn and very quite! I recommended very much!"
5,great dvd recorder,"I had a little trouble getting this installed because it is a SATA connected drive and I didn't know anything about that. However, after I purchased a sata card, and a sata power adapter and put them in my computer, the DVD recorder went in nicely. It runs very fast and does a really good job recording DVDs."
3,"OK, but I am a bit surprised","First of all, I am surprised that it did not come with all the hardware necessary to hook it up. It had the SATA data cable, but did not come with the power cable adapter. Guess what, it isn't really a stock item at most of the retail stores. So, I had to wait another week while I ordered the power cable connector from Amazon (after wasting a day driving to a bunch of retail stores).Next, I am a bit surprised at how flimsy the door is. I added this unit to a PC in my house that my children (4-7 years) use often for their games. Frankly, I am worried about it. We'll see how it lasts. As for the over all performance of the drive and writer, I give it an ""as expected"" score. It works. No thrills, it works.Still, come on, supply the required hardware with the product Lite-On! Or at least let me know that it is not included! Very big pain in the B-hind! Check your PC before you order!"
3,gift,the item was delivered promptly. finding it on Amazon was easy. I have no feedback on how the the itme operated for the recipiant of the gift.
2,their worst album,every album prior to this one i'd give 5 stars...but the shear redundancy and boredom is wearing thin for neurosis. it's getting harder and harder to decect substance...
4,these boys are marketing geniuses,"can you believe you are only hearing half of the damn music that is supposed to be heard on this disc...those damn neurosis kiddies have decided to but the other half of the album on a cd entitled ""grace"" by the neurosis evil twin ""tribes of the neurot""....and then you have to go out and get another cd player hook it up to another stereo and play them at the same time.... damn, why didn't i think of that???now they are selling two cd's for one recording....pretty smart....the songs on the neurosis cd are good by themselves, but it's a completely differnt world once both cd's are being played and it becomes the finest neurosis outing since ""souls at zero"".. it will be played equally as much as my meatloaf cds....i say buy this one at all cost."
5,Classic Peru,First heard Chabuca in Mexico in 1979-fantastic latin sound - the heart of latin music. My original Chabuca LPs are worn out. I almost get to see her in Mexico in 1981 but see got ill and died shortly after. A great loss. Great music - great sound - Classic.
1,A real piece of Junk,"This is quite a low star film. The plot is dumb, the acting is terrible, the characters are preachy and the Yeti looks like a Furby with horns. If you buy this movie you will most likely regret it. Just take my advice, this movie stinks."
4,One Cool pack!!!!,"I think yugioh is educational because you have to add and subtract and you can make new friends playing. Anyway, this is a great pack because it has great spell and trap cards and it has LV cards. But get 3 or 4 of these to get different combos.Also the ultra rares sell for up to 70$!!. This pack goes great with Rise of Destiny-but don't get different packs alot becausese getting the same pack multiple times means getting great combos. This pack is great! Trust me I'm a master duelist! P.S. I'm 10."
3,New Cards... Good or Bad?,"Yu-Gi-Oh is educational because it lets people have something to do when they are bored, think, teaches them math, and gives you duelists to be friends with. Durability is a problem. Try a tin, deck box, or card sleeves. This pack contains cards that can level up. To be exact, it means each turn you can offer a monster to summon its powerful form until it is at its final stage. Horus Dragon is a hot card. This also contains cards that work for certain monster elements like FIRE, WATER, and WIND. There are powerful fusion that are off the charts. These are original, but the old sets are better."
1,Soul of the Duelist...The Worst Booster Pack?,"Why bother with this pack? Sure, this comes with Horus, Mystic Swordsman, Armed Dragon, but who cares? The commons are terrible, the rares arn't worth it. Only one card stands out in this pack and that is Mobius the Frost Monarch. At least Rise of Destiny has cards like Back to Square One, The Creator and tons more. Stick to Rise of Destiny for great cards."
2,warning: dont bi these cards,"i was a huge yugioh fan for almost 2and a half years. when i bought this pack, that all changed. the cards in this series were pretty good for a few sets, not any more now they are rather uncreative. but they are better than duel master cards,i saw duel masters cards once, and i knew they would never get popular."
5,This should of never ran out of print.,When I bought the Logan's Run books I was afraid I would like the first book and not so much the other two.I was wrong.I liked the first one and loved the other two.The books are different than the movie or the TV series but in a good way.William F. Nolan wrote the second and third books by himself. He reminds me of Robert E. Howard's Conan series because he has the ability to take complex scenes and distil it down to a few sentences.The books flow so well that they are done before you know it. In other words they are not boring.The first one he wrote with George Clayton is good but drags in one scence Logan and Jessicia are running away from Francis and they hide in some civil war reenactment. I felt it was boarderline silly.The ending of the book was cool with the reverse chapter numbers.Is there and chance the rest of the books could be in print some day because they are supposely been written.Great book series.We need more.
3,logan trilogy,"I was a great fan of the film since the 70s, the 1st origional book ""Logans run"" is quite different with to many flights of fantasy, no explationation how things like how maze cars coped with the earths shifting plates, volcanoes, earthquakes etc and the fact that the crazy horse monument can never be finished. The film made better sence in many ways a bit more beliveable with its technology set within its enclosed dystopia, shame that many scenes were cut from the film due to 70s cencorship. Mr Nolan was a bit upset with the film according to his introduction in the trilogy. i would have been delighted that the film made Logan a world wide smash. Its funny how many belived the future would be so different in so short a period of a hundred yrs or so, mankind dosent work like that give a great distrust of anything new. Dont slag the film in many ways it makes better sence."
1,Heard it all before...,"Yep, Glen Benton and his God-hating cronies return once again to bash our brains with more monotomous blast beats and horrible vocals.I'm not saying there's anything particulary wrong with this album, as they are all very talented musicians, however its nothing new.Every song sounds the same, and features Benton grunting on about how much he hates religion and how he worships the devil. OK! We get it! You dislike Christians! Change the story! Funny thing is, he acknowledges Satan's existence but not God's. You can't have one and not the other Glen!Anyways, if all you want to hear is blast beats from start to finish, the same guitar riff over and over and some idiot screaming away like a toddler on a tantrum, then waste you money on this.If you want some decent death metal/grindcore, listen to PIG DESTROYER, CANNIBAL CORPSE, ANNOTATIONS OF AN AUTOPSY, JOB FOR A COWBOY, DESPISED ICON, ALL SHALL PERISH."
4,Praise Hell Satan!,"This sounds like a new and improved version of Dechristianize. The drumming refrains from too much blasting. The solos still rip. Harmonies are more abundant and properly placed, with a very black metal style of riff. And Glen Benton's king of death metal vocals age like fine wine, and shine over all these crappy throaty death-core vocalists. Erik Rutan does a great job with the production. Usually his recordings are too natural and dull for my taste, but here he captures a nice balance of tone and attack, with natural warmth. The vocals are much too loud in the mix, as is the case with most contemporary releases. Sometimes the songs are too long for the amount of progression involved. The cover of Yngwie's Disciples of Hell is an awesome closer. Very death transformed with butt-rock rhythmic appeal."
2,Missing creative singing and arrangements,Good but not groovy arrangemnents.Good repertoire but just for Gal Costa's fans.
4,For the Pros in the room,"While the book is an invaluable resource for people thinking of going into studio recording, it is vastly too sophisticated for the amateur home recording studio. If you are just beginning recording DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, it will be over your head. The name would suggest that it would be an ""Encyclopedia"" of information, but rather it is a book based on interviews with top producers and technicians. One should pay close attention to the word ""Expert"" in the title, because that is the intended audience."
5,A practical guide to the art and career of recording,"The Expert Encyclopedia Of Recording by musician, author and journalist Rick Clark is an expertly thorough and practical guide to the art and career of recording. Drawn from in-depth research with accomplished engineers, producers, and artists, The Expert Encyclopedia Of Recording is a direct and straightforward account covering everything from dynamic signal processing to production sickness to surround sound recording mixing and vocals. The Encyclopedia Of Recording is very highly recommended reading for anyone considering a career in the sound technology industry."
1,"Muddled, uninspired and offensive...","One day I have to figure out how to give a book no stars 'cause I feel horrible about giving ""Cradle of Splendor"" a star since it deserves none. This may be the worst book I have ever read (and I've read a lot of books). Let's just get it out in the open: this is a bad book. Bad writing, moronic storyline, and annoying characters. Bad enough I had to put up with cliched writing and a asinine plot but I couldn't understand half of it! I'm still not exactly sure of what happened. Some kind of alien/sex-thing..not that it matters. And let me just say that this book is very offensive to Brazilians. Throughout the book she describes Brazilians as lazy, dirty, incompetent, violent and stupid. She describes Brazilian society in the worst way possible and at the end thanks a Brazilian family for hosting her. I wonder what they would think of the beautiful way she depicted their country...don't buy this book. Please."
2,"Complex, with Good Characterizations","Brazil is attacked when spies discover that its government has acquired advanced technology. There are many characters involved in subterfuge in independent plots. Characterizations are good, though none of the characters are very likeable or easy to identify with. The book reads like a Quentin Tarantino movie: a rapid sequence of highly visual, often violent episodes. I'm not motivated to read more of her books, though they have won awards."
1,Unfulfilling,"Reading this book was like going to dinner at friend's house and smelling something wonderful in the kitchen. Yet when the meal was served it was something totally different and unappetizing. It starts out with an interesting idea but then spends the rest of the book hinting around it while venturing off in some pseudo-spy story with unwarranted and disturbing sexual overtones. One is left with a lot of unanswered questions about the activities behind what the author wrote. Her notions on international relations was simplistic, at best. Very disappointing."
4,Landscape 2 Cokin P Series Kit,"Although Amazon does not say, this kit includes Gold, Gradual Tobacco T2 Soft and Star 8 filters. Code: H211A. It would be better if it had included the Tobacco T1 that is less crazy than T2"
5,Love my pressure cooker,"I love using my pressure cooker and was happy to find the replacement part that I needed. The shipping was prompt, the price was reasonable and the replacement part worked."
5,The best dog nail clippers!,"I have three dogs, and I love these nail clippers. They are stury, sharp and safe. The best darn nail clippers I've ever used on a dog."
3,"Interesting album, not what I expected","I bought this CD because it seems to be Enya's first post-Clannad album and I thought I'd just try it out.You get a 16 track recording, only 11 of which appear to be Enya's work, 4 are some Jazz Club something and one is by Edith Piaf. It doesn't really sound anything much like her later work which I found to be disappointing. Two songs have her singing, a couple more have vocalizations but it all has a less polished sound compared to The Celts onward. It all manages to come across as early 80's romantic soundtrack stuff, not bad but not really what I wanted."
1,A big disappointment,"Even considering this a very early work of Enya, I must critize it. Especially when you love ANYWHERE IS, ORINOCO FLOW or ONLY TIME don't you even bother to buy it. The mid-80's soundtrack consist (except of few non-Enya tracks) just of songs of a very simple melody and synthetic arrangements. The two songs which are sung by Enya are poor and she sings it with a very unnatural, high voice:( Only Enya collectors should buy this..."
4,Durable enough and inexpensive,"After mastering the art of clamping the bags to the dust canister see my review on the JDCS Cyclone-II 3000 CK, I can now enjoy Beeing able to use plastic bag instead of a solid bin. Removing the bag from the canister is kind of a messy operation but after doing it a couple times you can of lern how to minimize the mess.As for the bags themselves they are quite durable and not that expensive when you compare it to the price of all other disposables.Just one note of caution, don't wait until you reach the ""full line"" to change the bag. If the bag is too full it becomes relatively difficult to tight it closed."
5,How Americans ended slavery,"Prophets of Protest is a collection of essays by scholars who are also teachers and local historians. The editors, both young professors at Harvard, gathered the group and facilitated the research by asking each to critique and help the others.This collection is very gratifying for me as an independent researcher and writer because my work has been to document the support of John Brown, abolitionist, by local African Americans in Virginia, both slave and free, in the Harpers Ferry raid in 1859. Hannah N. Geffert of Shepherd College (now West Virginia) writes ""Regional Black Involvement in the John Brown Raid"" by showing the geography that made sense of John Brown's plans. The local slaves supported him. They did not cause him to fail. Hannah Geffert writes this evidence in standard academic grounding; she is kind enough to credit my thirty years of research on this topic in her byline."
4,Grat driver.,"Usher usually built great drivers, this is not exception, for the price is hard to beat. And the T/S parameters I had measured are very close to Usher own T/S numbers, no lying here. Great performance. My only complaint is the driver looks in the picture a little better than really it is, but in the other hand is not a cheap looking driver and is very well manufactured."
5,wow,I really love this fragrance. Use to wear it when I was 25 years younger and it is still amazing to wear now.
3,Very useful for planning.,"On a recent trip to Tuscany, we found this book extremely useful for planning our days, but less useful when we actually got where we were going. This is basically a ""teaser"" book -- it contains lots of information that's helpful in deciding what you want to do, but if you're really interested in exploring a church, archeological site, or art gallery, you need a more in-depth guide. The street-maps of Florence were a little confusing, but once we figured out how to use them, they were very helpful."
4,An Indispensable Resource,"On my trip to Florence last June, I equipped myself with a map and this book and it was all I needed. The book is informative and full of rich detail about every inch of Florence/Tuscany's landmarks, sights, restaurants, nightlife, etc. Mapped with detailed illustrations of Florence's many Renaissance churches, you can literally appreciate everything as you make your way through each one of them. Additionally, the book lends useful tips about public transportation and travel, hotel information and what to expect, etc.While useful in your travels, this is also one to keep handy in your personal library if you should ever need a brief cultural or historical reference. Sadly and finally, however, this book is no substitute for the real thing. Go to Florence!"
5,Equal Best,"These DK guides are fantastic - we buy them for all of our destinations and pack them along with our other favourite books - the Michelan Green Guides. The DK books present glorious potted histories along with brilliant illustrations which bring the locations to life. Equal best because the book that goes in my back pocket is always the Michelan Green Guide - they fold in half and slip into the hip pocket whereas the DK book is too thick for that.Totally sold on these great books. Like the Michelans, they don't go out of date - history is just that."
3,A little thin,"These sweats are comfortable, but they are a little too thin for my taste. They feel a bit cheap compared to Russel gear I have bought in the paste. Not bad for sleep wear in the winter."
2,Light weight but uncomfortable,I've read other reviews that criticize these pants for being too light weight and not being actual sweat pants. But that is exactly why I like them. They are light enough to wear around the house and breath well and keep you cooler while exercising in the summer heat. They have a fairly wide elastic waist. I don't care for the draw string which tends to dig in a little (especially since the draw string knot faces inward) but for the price what can you expect. I also care less for the light and dark grey ones that are not 100% cotton. Overall fairly durable and a good value for the money.UPDATE: I was too optimistic about the fabric. I still don't mind the light weight material but it is scratchy/itchy and doesn't compare with an earlier version from Russell. They went cheap and I will never buy from them again.
2,Not what I wanted,These sweatpants were thinner than I expected and they also did not fit well around my waist. They have the one looped cord in the elastic and I find that those don't work as well as one cord split that you can tie.
2,Doesn't fit as listed,"HI we rec'd a ""Large"" which was more like an Xtra Large ""TALL"". Returned for a full refund."
1,These were thin and small,"These were thin and clingy and the size seemed to run smaller than the size charts implied. That happens a lot with the sizes on Amazon. I had to return them - couldn't wear them at all. They were uncomfortable, not relaxed as I expected."
2,"Light-weight, but fell apart quickly",The fabric is comfortable and light-weight but they fell apart too fast. Also the size runs big. I bought a Large and it was like wearing a mumu with pants legs.
3,They've changed,"Apparently the fabric content of these pants has changed. The feel, fit and drape is very different. Not as much cotton?"
1,Stay away,"Got these and in less than a week, the tie string broke. Sent them back for a replacement pair. Second time wearing them, snap - broken string. Looking at the string you can tell it is cheap but this is insane."
1,These are NOT sweat pants,"As others have commented, be sure these are what you want. These are, in no way, what I think of as traditional ""sweat pants"". I also do not believe they fir the definition of ""jersey"". They are very thin cotton, more like what I would think of as ""thin, cool cotton summer lounge wear"". My stupidity for not checking further."
1,cheap,"too flimsy for our weather, and it didn't say in the description , how flimsy they would be.Not a good product for a cold climate."
2,Runs way too large!,"The pants are way, way larger than normal sizing. Had to return it. On the plus side, no hassle returning."
2,Not what I expected,I expected fleece lined old fashion sweat pants. These are very lightweight and I sent them back. Please read the description carefully before you purchase.
4,Just one thing...,"I like the relaxed fit, but they are just a bit too baggy in the crotch. The pockets are a little shallow as well."
3,They're fine but not as good as the ones I bought three years ago,"The material is more coarse and the ankle elastic is loose, but the fit is the same. I'll keep them."
3,bigger and thinner than expected,"I got these to replace ones I really liked. I don't remember that brand. I got the same size (m) but these are much baggier. The material feels thin, but for me the problem is the elastic waist is very thin and loose, so I am required to tie the string. My older ones stay put without the string."
4,great for lounging,"I have had a pair of these pants for years. They are lightweight, great for lounging around the house and practically indestructible. I had to look real hard to find these again. i just bought my second pair. The grey ones are the best. They are the lightest and dont noticably fade.The size small is good for women. My friends wear this also."
2,Complete Disappointment. Lowered standards!,"These sweatpants are a total letdown and not even close to the quality Russell sweatpants I've owned in the past. I haven't even worn them yet or taken the other two I ordered out of the box. To say these are lightweight would be an understatement, they are thin as cardboard maybe more so. I can tell just by the look and feel they will not last long and I plan on returning them ASAP. I will post pictures when I have the time so others can see exactly what they're getting. If this kind of ""quality"" is what I can expect from Russell, then they've lost me as a customer. It doesn't help either the description makes no mention of how thin these pants are either, and I don't know whether that's on Amazon's or Russell's part. Buyer beware!"
5,Exercise pants,"I like the light weight and the elastic bottom. The pants are flexible and comfortable for working out, walking, etc.Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Performance Elastic Bottom Jersey Pant, Black, Medium"
3,Lightweight Fabric,"I was looking for 100% cotton sweatpants. These are cut like sweatpants but are disappointingly thin, not the same weight and feel as traditional sweats."
3,Not as heavy as I expected,"I was looking for a heavy weight version of sweat pants. Please note when I say 'weight' I mean thickness of material. The product details indicated a weight of 13.6 ounces, which was about 50% heavier than other pants I found online at Amazon. Unfortunately these are very light, probably best for summer use. I have a pair from Champion which are about 3 times heavier than these. I selected a medium size but after trying them on I should have gone with small. These pants are huge. I would have sent them back but I already washed them. I threw them in the dryer at a high heat hoping that they would shrink significantly. Although they did shrink they'll still about a size large. Maybe a few more times washing and drying will do the trick. On the plus side they are comfortable and will be good for warmer weather."
1,Think twice,"These are very sheer and lightweight, to the point of being able to almost see through them. There were strings hanging from the one pair I opened to inspect and I was extremely disappointed with the workmanship as well as fabric quality (definitely not what I would call ""jersey"" material). I am returning them as these are really unacceptable - I should have paid more attention to the prior reviews from other purchasers.."
3,Comfortable fabric,"Comfortable for lounging during the day, but very good for my daily dog walks with my two best friends. Since I can't buy them at any local stores, having reasonably priced online purchases available."
1,Not the same as before,"I used to buy these all the time (Medium size) and never had a problem with them. They used to be well fitting and very airy feeling so you don't sweat too much.The latest edition is very wide and stretchy....the same medium size is way too wide of an elastic waistband. And the legs are very wide and also the pant length is longer than usual. Additionally, the pockets are about 33% smaller than previous versions.All in all, this was a very disappointing version of an otherwise great product. I hope Russell goes back to the drawing board on this one..."
1,Clown pants,Don't buy. One size fits no-one and brother I'm not kidding. There.s an excess of material that borderlines on insane. Poor design...Retailers should not sell products designed this poorly.
1,tshirt weight material,this sell needs to clearly state that these are made with t-shirt like material not the traditional sweat shirt material users of russel products have been acustomed to
2,way too big and baggy!,"Russell seems to have changed its sizing since the last time I bought a pair of these workout pants. Way too big, way too baggy for the gym. Now they're just new pajama bottoms."
2,Russell sweats not what I expected,"I ordered these because my husband always liked Russell Athletic clothing, however, these sweats are very thin and not like ones he has had before.I would not recommend them."
1,Sizing and thickness not as stated,"I've worn Russell sweatpants for years, and size medium always fit. This pair however is long enough and wide enough to fit a large big and tall. Since I'm maybe 5'3' these were ridiculous. The elastic at the ankles is so loose it may as well be an open leg. The material is also incredibly thin--I've never seen ""sweatpants"" so thin. I was very disappointed. I'll look for another brand."
2,"Nice quality, but sized XX Tall","I have worn these pants for 10 years for working in the yard and garden. They are light enough to wear in the hot summer months and help keep the creepy crawlies away. This particular pair was 6 inches too long. I think they must be ""seconds""."
3,Rubber Band Hems,"The title says it all. I took the stitches out of the cuff hem to shorten the legs and, to my surprise, instead of using elastic the mfg used a rubber band! Now I'm wondering what other shortcuts were taken when they made these pants."
3,cut big,"nice, not too heavy weight, good for sleep and lounging; cut big, but at least there's elastic at waist and cuff."
2,Excessively Large,"These sweatpants are designed to be infinitely expandable. Basically, the designer had extremely obese people in mind. Not great for looking decent while jogging."
1,My review,"Well lets start with this,I did not like the sizing of these pants nor was the thickness acceptable to me.In the past Russell has made the highest quality jogging pants on the market, these I bought was just to thin for my tastes."
2,Awkward.,"Awkward fitting pants here. They seem more like balloon pants than sweat pants. I would not buy these again. They are soft, but the fit is too big in the mid areas."
2,Not happy at all,"In my opinion the pants are too bulky and hang loose enough to look and feel really baggy. The weight is just not what I expected of ""sweatpants"" that I am used to. Altogether I'd not recommend these to anyone and I'll probably just throw mine away and learn from the bad experience."
4,heavy duty,Returned this item because it was more heavy duty than I wanted. I think this is a great buy for someone looking for warm casual wear
3,who made these?,"Tight fitting, slim through thighs and gusset, binding at ankles. Will not re-purchase. Made for bean-pole large men. Good in a pinch but not for running, the gym or other things."
4,Nice lightweight and they have pockets,"My one-star ding was for length. I'd read reviews saying that they shrink after washing, but they didn't shrink enough for me by about three inches. Otherwise comfy, nice pockets, and all around good choice."
2,Sizing Problem,"I try to buy only 100% cotton sweats. For that reason I ordered these in black which at the time was the only color available in 100% cotton. The material is fine. I ordered large based on the sizing guidelines. It was too large - especially in the length. Since 100% cotton is hard to find I decided to wash them in hopes of them shrinking. They shrunk a bit, but not much. I then ordered a pair of mediums. They are also too large, again especially in the length. After washing, the large and medium are of almost identical size. So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy. However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist. The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up. It does have a built in rope, but it's not elastic and therefore not comfortable. I give it 2 stars only because it's 100% cotton."
3,"Runs large, very large","I have bought these for awhile now. They are hard to find in the stores locally. I've noticed these are a much lighter material than the older ones i have, and they run very large."
1,chep,The sweats i got were not as they looked on the ad. They are very the almost like pj's.Very Very disappointed
5,Happy Husband,My husband sleeps in these pants. You can't tell from the pictures or description of the product but they have elastic around the legs which he loves. I call them his nighty night pants. He is always cold because I have the AC cranked up all year. Even though these warmups are light weight they keep him warm enough to endure the blizzard in the house. If you are considering ordering this item you might want to order a size smaller than normal. They run large.
2,"Not sweat pants, Very thin standard jersey material pants",These pants would be nice on the hotter weather when you want a pant that's not too bulky or insulated.The material is a typical jersey cotton so it feels more like a tee shirt than a sweat pant material.my husband didn't like them since he likes a heavier traditional sweat pants.So in all they're not bad but more so on a light weight cheaper feeling pair than anything appropriate for winter.
4,lightweight jogging pants.,These lightweight jogging pants are great for summer months. Lightweight and soft yet durable. I bought my first pair about 5 years ago and they served me well. I gave the new pair a 4 star rating because the string broke the first day I wore them. I was able to run the string back through and no more broken strings.

2,Fun but lots of crash bugs,"My son loves this game but multiple times per session he is asking ""daddy why is the computer frozen?"". There is a patch online to make it work with Vista and another patch for crash bugs but after installing both the product is still VERY unstable. I expect a lot more from LEGO.There are cut scenes with guns, but no killing, if that is a concern."
5,a great game that will provide fun for children and adults.,"This game turned me into a chess player in just two weeks of playing every once in a while. This game may discourage people who think that chess is too hard to learn or people who think chess is for freaks. This game is good for people who don't know a bishop from a knight because of the game's built in tutor who teaches you all you need to know and some techniques I never expected him to cover. When playing chess, captures are animated in a half Battle Chess, half jokes you can find off Loony Tunes style.For instance, when a bishop captures a queen, the bishop shoots a spell at the queen and the queen is shrunk down to nothing. This game features chess sets from the Western and Pirates themes as well as a traditional chess set. Lego shouldn't have discontinued this game.It's both fun and educational.Gosh, there's five words I'd thought I'd never say in a row."
1,would not buy again,"CD is for windows 98 even though it says XP on the cover, also requires a patch which has a lot of problems installing and I am an IT professional."
3,If you want to completely relive the movie...,"If you already saw the movie, loved it with every fiber of your being, and you want to relive it over and over again, then by all means get the book--it has absolutely stunning photography and those too-cute-for-words penguins.I love penguins and love seeing great photography, but since I already saw the movie (a documentary), as well as watching the (somewhat inane) extras on the DVD, I don't really feel the need for the book. It is basically a picture book of the movie, with much of Morgan Freeman's narration as the text. There is no additional penguin information, just what you saw in the movie.So your options are: If you thought the movie was good but you probably wouldn't watch it again, then you may want to find a different penguin book. If you liked the movie and want a nice coffee table book, then you will probably like this book. If you could not get enough of the movie, then this book is for you."
4,A Beautiful Collector's book,"This is more of a collector's book than an informative book--what's in the movie is exactly in this book. However, there's an interesting section about making the film--the penguins were very curious about the camera! This has a beautiful cover and beautiful pictures. If you loved this film as much as I do, get it! The only problem is, some of the panoramic shots are grainy, and you have to hold the book out to see a smooth picture. I knocked a star of for that."
2,Is it doing anything?,"This product was easy to install, and when I turned my computer back on - Wow!, I had 128 more megabytes of memory.Unfortunately, except for the readout on my computer about more memory, I have seen no other sign of increased memory. My computer is not any faster, I cannot open any more programs at the same time, and some computer games which could not be opened because I didn't quite have enough memory, still can't be opened.I phoned to get help from Viking, and they were friendly, but said the readout on my computer that says I have 128 more megabytes of memory may be the only sign I have that the product is working. This product may be doing great things inside my computer, only I wish it SHOWED some sign of this in my daily computer use."
4,Nice crustacean you got there,"This is the nicest crustacean themed lapel pin you're likely to find. It's not gaudy and bedazzled like most, and at a glance people know it's a lobster, unlike half the pins on this site. If you have a lobster lover in your family or circle of friends, this is the pin to buy."
1,a waste of money,"Reading this book was like listening to a very talkative neighbor banter on and on about his opinions on work. It was not at all what I expected: boring reading and no useful advice, just opinions(I only read a bit and returned it)."
4,Get back on the right side of the Tracks,"This was the one G1 Transformers I never saw in the store, and therefore never had a chance to beg my Mom to get me one. Two decades later, I finally got him. For a G1 robot, he is fairly durable. His transformation is as good as any from recent years. The ruboff sign is a nice touch. Some of the stickers don't want to stick onto him, and like most G1 robots his missles do not launch, but all in all, I am happy to say that this is the one G1 robot that stands the test of time."
2,Warning the plastic feels cheap and easily breakable if you attempt transformation.,"Don't know if all the original Tracks are like this or the other reissues. The foot snapped off on mine then I returned it for an exchange. Shortly after while I was transforming it, I was sliding one of Tracks' hands out and one of the sliding side pegs that held the hand in place snapped. It resulted in the hand coming off. A great while after that a peg that held the whole upper car rear on back snapped off completely while I was transforming him. The toy is cool but the plastic is too cheap. Buyer beware."
4,How bout it shiney one?,"Hay everyone. im reviewing tracks. Tracks forms into a sports car. He looks kinda weird in his robot form. becareful with his wings they seem too come off pretty easly., but they attach back easly. He wasnt my faverite in the show. Appered in the second season. He is a great toy too add too your collection, i recommed him too all autobot fans. He is called a Lousy earth-lover by his autobot friends. thinks they are jelous of his good looks. thanks for reading hope this review was helpful."
2,"A lot of theory, less practical","I bought this guide to enhance my suncluster3x knowledge. It's a good book, but with more ""designs"" and practical battle-camp examples it could be a great choice."
4,wrong color,I thought it would be black like the pitchure ...wrong...it was white. the lanp works great.
4,Good light,I have a custom fishing rod tieing business and this is a very good light for close up work. The glass is good in it and the light is good. Price is right too.
1,missing parts,this item was missing the clip that held it to the table...very disappointed could not get a resolution to this problem now stuck with a lamp that can not be used :(
3,Video good but doesn't measure up,"As an elementary school teacher, I read Bridge to Terabithia with my class every year. It's the best core-lit book in our school. The video is pretty good for a TV movie. The acting performances approximate the characters pretty well. It could easily been a lot better with the addition of a classroom teacher character. Combining the teacher Jess loves with the one he can't stand was a bad move. Still. I enjoy showing the movie after reading the book. As we say in Spanish, Mejor que nada!"
2,disappointment,"I wish there would have been other poor reviews of this movie prior to my purchasing it. It is my opinion the positive reviewers must have been reviewing the recent theatre version of ""Bridge to Teribithia."" The storyline in this PBS version was very lack-luster and slow-moving. It falls way short of the promises on the back of the cover. The imaginary world of Terabithia is never seen as more than a nice little wooded area where the main characters go to play. There is very little reference to what they imagine while there. Character and plot development are sadly missing from this big disappointment."
4,Excellent adaptation!,"This review is for fans of the book: You will not be disappointed! Most of the scenes and a lot of the dialog are straight from the book. It is very heartfelt and touching. The computer generated characters from the previews are in very short scenes and much of the plot revolves around happenings at school. Overall, very well done. Really more appropriate for children in third grade and above."
1,Try the book!,"Well, let's just say it could be a whole lot better! They cut and change much from the original story, you'll constantly being doing a Double-take. The acting was decent, but let's call this movie a flop, disgracing the book. If you read the book, and want to see how badly the messed up the movie, be my guest, but don't say I didn't warn you. Just try and resist the urge to throw things at Leslie.."
1,Doesn't do the book justice!,"I read this book with my sixth-graders. We were enthralled with the book, and so excited about the movie- boy were we disappointed! The movie leaves out so much of the storyline. The acting is not especially superior either. Read the book and don't waste your time on the movie! Let the imagery Katherine Paterson creates be your movie!"
1,It was a lousy movie.,The movie was lousy because it was not match to the book. I rather the movie was the same as the book. Where was Mrs. Meyers and Ellie? Why did Jess not meet the whole family of Leslie's?
2,Unabridged to Terabithia,"Since I reviewed this movie after the remake, February 2007, I was very disappointed watching the original. More so because in the 2007 version the parts that both Jess and Leslie imagined were very well animated. Also, there was not as much character development in the PBS version; so the viewer is not as drawn into the emotion that Jess feels when he loses his new best friend, Leslie. This story was supposed to be a tragic but revealing experience for a young pre-adolescent who has to deal with death. I was not moved by this version of the story. I believe that a talent of Annette O' Toole's stature was wasted in this Production. The film was just too short, very low budget and not developed well at all."
4,classic kids,"This is the kind of piece I would teach in my classroom. The story lines are real-life-oriented and valid. This version is very straight-forward, and I appreciated the lack of glitz and glamorization. It is one of those things that really doesn't need to be ""modernized"" to be understood as relevant to the life experiences of middle-schoolers and families. The focus is on the kids and their experiences and situations and feelings, as opposed to the surface surroundings. All kinds of situations are reasonably posited."
3,Get's old too quickly!,"I first tried these in a bundle of other gluten-free products, and it was so fresh. So I decided to buy it in bulk, and the expiration date was only three months. I ended up given most of it away because I didn't have time to eat all of the 12 packages I received. The taste is ok, not too sweet, but I found myself getting sick of it fast."
4,An all round excellent book - a must buy,"I have been studying the chakra system for use as a kinesiologist and I find this to be one of the best books out there. It details so many aspects of each chakra, the system, and how they play out for people. The book includes useful tools, tables and suggestions that make it a life-changing read. Thank you Judith."
2,"good quality, received in timely manner, informationally junk and not on anything foundationally sound","I got what I wanted, but didn't know it was junk until I read it. Wouldn't bother reading it except I had a class on it. Wouldn't have taken the class if I knew it was garbage with no foundational structure. It sucks people in and makes them appear intellectual when actually it is illogical and nas no truth to it. I wouldn't want my kids to read, or myself... instead of selling it online so some other person would be exposed to its hypocracy- I will just throw it in our fire and keep ourselves warm while it is still cold- and prevent others from being sucked into it as well. It really is trash, honestly."
5,A deeper knowledge of oneself,"I purchased this book when I was in a sea of confusion and standing in crossroads about my life. It provided great insight to dark corners that I had even forgotten they existed, but that were playing a great role in my personal affairs and stood in the way to achieving my goals. I use it as a guide for my path in life and often refer back to it when things are not going the right way. Since I purchased it the first time, I have purchased it again and again as a present for people who are dear to me. Highly recommended!"
1,Poor Quality,"Used this chair only once, and just like another reviewer stated when I went to take it out today, the nylon material around the inflatable tube was all shredded at the seam. Very disappointing as others reviewers stated it was the best lounger they ever had. It was very expensive to fall apart at the seams. I am sending it back today for a full refund. Although the chair didn't meet my expectations, Amazon is great for sending a return label to send it back."
2,Chair lounger,The material around the inflated tubes is already starting to pull apart after less than 2 weeks. The float has to be adjusted for the different size people in the family. One size does not fit all.
2,disappointed/water chair,Received this promptly but it has four places that must be filled with air and this is not an easy thing to blow up..... stuck it back in box and figured I'd garage sale it out ...who wants to sit at beach or on boat blowing up this thing for an hr.
3,Not so great for us 200 pounders,"I'm a six foot 200 pound guy. Quite simply, I sank to the bottom while my wife laughed for what seemed like hours. While this may be a 5 star product for smaller (less fat) people, I'm taking away two stars for failing to list weight limitations in the description."
4,Great value,"I'm not sure why on earth amazon is calling this a toy. I was surprised by the quality when I purchased this chair. Warning though, make sure you have a pump to blow this up. You will not be blowing into it without blowing your cheeks out."
4,Good CD; but what you should know....,"OK: Helmet was one of the first Deftone-ish bands: it could've been huge, however what you should know is that this band is comparable to Nirvana; not Tool. Nirvana is great in it's rite that it was the most original band of it's time: one of my favorite bands: good radio-friendly chord stuff: not way the heck out there guitar riffs like The Dillinger Escape Plan, or At the Drive In. Nirvana can be respected as one of the greateset revolutionizing bands, however Helmet was basicilly a bunch of rich boys who's parents bought them instruments one day and they decided to form a band. You can really tell when you listen to how simple the songs are. Don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to pull a Simon, but I'm not talking .... It's just the way it is. Good stuff though; check out the drummers stuff with former Faith No More frontman Mike Patton, the guitarist from The Jesus Lizard and other great stuff: Tomahawk."
3,yeah it's great 3.5 stars,"It might get boring but it's still awesome nice heavy riffs and it's just cool.I really hate the fact that this band is mostly just into that gay gangsta music and only rock is a few percent of what they like,i don't know i heard that somewhere.But anyway back to this cd some songs might get boring but the other songs are awesome they're heavy and great if you like them check this out you will like this especially if you like alternative metal i guess, then listen to something way heavier and faster than this like some children of bodom now there's some real guitar players they should'nt even be in the same category than helmet but that's way better"
1,Don't listen to the people that say its good.,"This band is ingenius, if you hate talent that is. I know alotta these people here are saying""This band is great.singer just screams alot and the guitars go dur-dur-dur-dur. You can't tell the difference between tracks there all the same mombo jumbo BULL!Not one good song on the album. Their just a bunch of peoplefloating around in a neverending sea of bong water muttering random words, then writing down whatever they think of first and recycling the same simple guitar riffs over and over, then calling it a song. The bottom line is,""JUST SAY NO TO HELMET"""
3,"Influential, but not amazing","Helmet is undisputably one of the most influential bands on today's music scenes, both on the mainstream rock circuit and in more underground acts. Their great gift to the rock world was heavy, pounding, infectious riffs, which this album is chock full of. However, trendsetting music sometimes has rough edges, and ""Meantime"" is also full of those. Two big things jump out at me: the vocals and guitar solos. The vocals are alright at times, but there are some songs with this rough, agressive growling that just sounds ridiculous and really takes away from the song. And the vocals never add to the music, they just sort of blend in at their best moments. Then, there's the solos... they're horrible. They're painful to listen to. I give the band something for at least including solos, but when you put them with the vocals, you have music that's a bit embarassing to listen to. This album is good for it's era, but has some obvious flaws."
3,Great music poor handling,Every song on this cd is awesome! this disc rocks and everyone should buy it. the cover however was cracked probably due to some lazy ups personelle that threw it like a frisbee.
3,Powerfully limited,"Hard-hitting sophomore starts strong, but throughout a brief ten tracks does show signs of uninspired repetition which weighs its total down quite a bit."
3,Helmet's best,"Thsi is Helmet's best album. Deceptively simplistic yet really Paige is a very complex guitarist. I saw Helmet in concert with only a few people in the room way back when this CD first came out and it was awesome. Very good, very heavy, riff-oriented stuff on this CD. Standout tracks: In The Meantime, Unsung."
4,Role models.,"This 1992 debut is one of the better alt-metal albums of the early 90's. It's not the best thing I've ever heard, but it's still pretty solid. ""Unsung"" is easily the big song here, very good, very catchy, but the rest of this rather short album packs a punch as well. If you've heard them on soundtracks like ""Jerky Boys"", ""The Crow"", or ""Judgment Night"" with ""House Of Pain"", and want to hear more, this is a good choice. It will go great with your ""Tool"" and ""Fugazi"" cd's."
3,Black and White,"Why would you put white clips on a black seat? The pieces that you attach the seat to the toilet are white, not blsck. It is pretty good for the price, but if you hava a black toilet, then it looks odd with the white attachment pieces."
3,overall not bad,"i had no problem with installation, only problem i have with the product is that the toilet seat will not stay up on it's own. so when going number one, any male visitor has to hold the toilet seat. sucks."
1,had to return!,"to long, wrong size and they took an extra $15 from me because i had to return it...no reorder required"
1,Don't waste your Money Folks !!,"This was such a disappointment upon arrival at our home. It is cheaply made, and obviously will not last very long. The vinyl is thin, tears very easily. But, worst of all the bolt/nut design is completely wrong. It will no tighten enough to keep the seat in place. When we sit on the damned thing, it tries to move out from beneath us. It's like riding a green colt for the first time.If it wasn't such a hassle to return it, I would, and tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine."
3,Good for a few months,"This is size and color are hard to find, so I was elated when I found this. The seat was easy to install and very comfortable. After about 4 months, the seat cushion started to crack, due to the air inside the cushion and pressure of sitting on it. Electrical tape would not hold it and crack got wider. I am buying another one and hope it will last longer. At least until I can find a better quality one."
2,White hardware on a black lid? Really?,It is soft but the hardware is cheap white plastic making it look crummy if you have a black toilet. Just silly. I will end up throwing it out. Wish I could find just a nice black padded cover. At least you could sit on top. Bolts on with plastic bolts that have a long slide hole so should fit any toilet. But that also makes it tend to slide around on top while attached.Back to OEM lid and putting a towel on top for me.
2,"Get In Car, Go To Woods, Come Home","My title for this review is more than a synopsis of this film, it is the film. I would give this an ""A,"" as a student film, but a definitive ""F,"" as a DVD purchase (or rental). Two guys take a drive to the woods and come home. Along the way there are lingering shots of creatures and things: a crow, ants swarming, wedding ring on finger, and a slug. This attempt at symbolism seems contrived and accomplishes nothing. Another reviewer said that this film is 'beautifully nuanced.' A nuance is subtly evocative. This film has no fragrance. I'm sure the filmmaker worked hard on this and had the best of intentions, but I just can't get behind this one."
4,a glimpse into a friendship and the passage of time,"I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because of so many excessively long tracking shots. The scenery is lovely, but these shots take up too much time.Aside from that quibble, this is a nice, brief look at two friends who have grown and changed over the years; one is married and about to be a father, while the other is trying to cling to bits of the past but finding himself lost, as we see in the final scene.The spare music by Yo La Tengo is perfectly suited to the film, and the two main actors are unpretentious and not trying to be too earnest or ""Method."""
1,Nope.,"I'm all for quiet, comtemplative films that are all about mood and atmosphere. That and the great reviews are what made me want to rent this. Wow, what a snoozer, and not in a good way. Nothing much happens, the dialog is mostly superficial, then it's over. Some nice scenery is about the only positive thing I can say. Unless you really want to see Will Oldham naked (trust me, I don't think you do), don't bother."
1,are you kidding me with these 5star reviews?,"ppl that r giving this 'film' 5stars must be friends with the director or actually worked on the film as not many would give this film any stars!! all these 'hidden meanings' etc call the film what it is, a boring mess!!! they drive for most of the film and the climax is they take a bath and the one guy massages the other, WOW!!! and the 'commentary is like 5 min at the beginning and another minute in the middle and thats it!!! the 'director' sounds likes she is stoned in her 5min of speaking but i assume they just fell asleep watching this movie! i have never used the 'fast forward' button so many times in my life!! and on the cover it claims 'one of the finest films of america!' give me a break!! id rather watch paint dry!!"
1,old joy old boreing,sat through the most boreing movie i have ever seen .it did nothing made no sense and was just stupid and a total waste.
5,Yeah,"This film is incredible. I bought it because I'm a huge Will Oldham fan, but it's for everybody else too. Just. Watch it."
1,"Beautiful, with lots of meaningful silences","This is a beautifully shot and nuanced film. However, I just don't understand what it is these guys lost. They don't ring true as friends who have grown apart: both are hippy-dippy; both seem in the same place mentally; and their interests and conversations reflect not a loss of spark, but the sheer banality of their own personalities. What is it that divides them? The fact that one is married with a kid on the way and the other is a drifter? What else? Apart from Kurt's creepiness, these guys are are blanks. And there are way too many silences designed to provide the appearance of substance. This film reminds me of what I have heard is the appeal of Tom Cruise's face: a pretty canvas upon which one projects meaning."
1,Old Joy gives No Joy,"This movie struggles to give some meaning to a lost hippie relationship. It is superficial, stilted and unworthy of mention as drama. The dog is the best actor in the movie, engendering more sympathy than either of the leads.Usually I can find some shred of value in a film, but this one is a total loss. There is no credible story, no theatrical tension, and no denouement.I knew that there must be an exception to 'De gustibus non disputandum est"". This is it."
2,boring game,"This game was very long and boring. It also had no real reference to the simpsons. Someone who has never seen the show before can do just as well as I could in this game. Personally I am looking for some simpsons trivia in there. This game never leaves our shelf, it just sits there collecting dust. WE played it a few times to feel like we got our money's worth and that is about it."
3,FUNNY GAME,I LOVE PLAYING THIS WITH MY boyfriend and brother in laws because it shows me and my sisters how well they know women
3,Magnifier Light,Good light and lens. The head is too heavy to be held by the arms so the lamp head is constantly lowering to rest on the table. A pretty poor design
2,Ladder Bookcase,"THe ladder bookcase is cute. However, it is of poor workmanship, making it a terribly expensive item.THe item arrived with one piece obviously damaged. On closer inspection 4 additional pieces were defective. When I called the company to reorder I was offered money off to keep the defective item. It took persistance to get the parts replaced.Once in the parts department, they were unclear as to the pieces I wanted. THeir system did not corelate with the lettered system on the instructions.It took over 2 weeks for the repoacement pieces to arrive. Even those had minor imperfections to them.The ladder was tricky to assemble. Once assembled, I am less than satisfied with the ""fit"". Many of the shelves do fit squarely with the outer frame. The ladder is not very stable.IF I had it to do again, I would bypass this item."
3,There are better strategy guides...,"This book is big on info that experienced players already know, not so much on details of all the secrets. It needs less graphics and more photos and descriptions. However, it is helpful in finding most of the secrets that even the more experienced players haven't been able to find. Worth buying, but not worth paying a lot."
1,This could be a waste your money,"If you want to leave with bad feelings; this is for you. Acting may be OK, but to write about such sad reality is not for me, especially at this time of the year. Christmas Carol by Dickens would be a better replacement. After the first disc, could not even think of watching the other two."
1,ehhh they're ok,"They are not bad but it could be better. There's really nothing special. And I have no clue how you can compare them to the extremely talented Marc Anthony! The songs sound over-produced and the guys are very femine looking (if you know what I mean). But whatever, waste your money if you want."
4,An incredable duo with a new syle,"ALEO is the a the new hispanic duo, who will soon be taking over. Unlike other duos these guys have a unique style, besides the fact that they look fly. Thier songs are great, nice Salsa beat and Leonardo is a great composer..."
2,Average ballards singers trying to sing Salsa.,"Too weak, this not Salsa perse. These two guys are Ralph Mercado's answer to Servando y Florentino from Venezuela. Im a Puerto Rican that respects the original roots of the Afro-Cuban music. This is a good ballards album not Salsa. THANKS!! great singing ability from the singers in this album."
2,BUENO,"""CUANDO TE VEO CON EL"" ES EL MEJOR TEMA DEL DISCO. TAMBIEN HAY OTROS BUENOS TEMAS COMO ""DECIR ADIOS"" Y ""MUJER DE MI VIDA"". LOS DOS INTEGRANTES DE ALEO TIENEN MUCHO TALENTO PERO CREO QUE HACIA FALTA UN POCO MAS DE VARIEDAD A LA PRODUCCION. A PESAR DE QUE CUENTAN CON LOS MAESTROS DE LA PRODUCCION RALPH MERCADO E ISIDRO INFANTE. CREO QUE RALPH MERCADO Y SU SELLO RMM DEBERIAN TRABAJAR MEJOR A ESTE GRUPO Y APROVECHAR SU TALENTO. SUERTE!"
5,Very good,An inside view with very informative and insightful interviews with the key players. If you want to understand what happened with the GFC then I recommend you watch this Frontline episode.
4,Good Overview,What I like most about PBS is that it has far less political affiliation than the big guys like MSNBC and Fox News. What we have here is an almost hour-long documentary on the cause of and response to the financial meltdown that we're still dealing with now.Understand that this is basically a summary. It is not an exhaustive source by any means as a lot more went into the financial crisis than what could be covered in a PBS special. This is a good place to start however.
1,Absolute rubbish.,"This is quite possible the worst piece ever done by Frontline. Practically no reporting involved on what was really happening that brought down the banking industry, and to make matters worse, ends with a quip by E. Warren about how all the glory days of banking are gone. Granted when this was produced, it was probably early in 2009, but by the June 2009 air date, could she be more wrong? Incredibly disappointing. This story isnt over yet."
1,"Vomit, stupor, wheezing, and drooling","After my one cat has these, I find him staring off into space, wheezing, with drool hanging from his mouth, he is barely responsive, and does not acknowledge me unless I try to move him. I then will find the vomited, mostly whole, Whiskas Temptations somewhere around the house. It takes him many hours to come out of this, but he slowly does. This was the 3rd time this happened, and I finally figured out what was causing it, I thought he was having a seizure! Very scary! Our other cat has no problem with this treat, but guess we will be going back to our old, more expensive brand."
1,Is this a Veryan?,"That's not a rhetorical question. The first 50 pages made me wonder -- they don't read like any Veryan book I've read. A friend of mine who is also a long-time fan of Ms. Veryan got the same impression. The entire plot doesn't sound like something Veryan would contrive, chiefly because it IS so contrived. This was not up to the usual high Veryan standards. I was very disappointed with this book."
3,Read the book first,"The book, Gomorrah by Roberto Saviano, is one of the best books I've read in recent years. It is a tremendous expose of the organized crime system in Italy and Europe.The movie leaves out so much of the connecting story that without having read the book in advance I don't think this movie would have made much sense to me. I do not speak Italian so I had to rely on the subtitles to follow the dialog and plot. Perhaps that is why I believe the movie would be incomprehensible to me if I hadn't read the book first.Having said that, it is a well made film and the action keeps it moving along. But the book goes much further and will provide you muuch more enlightenment about the Comorra crime families."
2,Over-hyped trash,"""Greatest Mafia movie ever made!"" is what a lot of critics said. I say, rubbish. Brooding, dark, uneven, disjointed and annoying best describe this overly-long film. People killing each other, all the time, everywhere. Wow. Such creativity! I guess that one brief scene aboard a gondola in Venice lets people think that this movie must really be ""hip"". Not. Save your money and time. Want great gangster action? Godfather's 1 and 2 and Scarface. Cannot improve on them."
2,Overrated,I heard so much about this film and how good it was. When I finally got to see it I was really disappointed and thought that it was overrated.
2,Gomorrah is No Good Fellas,"Gomorrah came highly recommended, but honestly, I just don't see why. The movie was disjointed and aimless, trying to act like a pseudo-documentary while following around five different people and showing how the organized crime syndicate affects their lives, or defines their lives. Actually quite boring, tedious, dull. The director never allows us to ""connect"" with the main characters, so ultimately, we don't care about them. Just random, strung-together scenes. There is no discernible plot or story - I just couldn't watch more than half the film, and had to turn it off.Goodfellas is the crime movie to watch, not this one."
2,Not the Godfather!,"This film Gomorrah has a lot of comparsion to the Godfather, but to me it fell short in that aspect. Because the movie was slow and didn't have a lot of action or real story line to it at all, it was can of all over the place. And the end was stupid!"
2,Bleak and Dreary,"A bleak, dreary and much too lengthy film of contemporary life in criminally ridden Naples, Italy. This is an unsuccessful attempt at cinema verite. There no real excitement or dramatic involvement--the characters are much too shallow or unsympathetic to really care about. The lighting is frequently much too dim, since a lot of the ""action"" takes places in dark hovels and basements. Although it may be of interest to sociologists and social workers, I don't think it will hold much appeal for mainstream moviegoers."
2,"Extremely incoherent that makes it very difficult to follow and enjoy., August 31, 2009","It's so incoherent that makes it very difficult to follow and enjoy. It tells different stories of different people and they do not intersect with each other.The only good thing about this movie is it terrifyingly exposes the brutality and the effect the Camorra crime syndicate has on everybody. They kill anybody including children. They sell drugs and collect taxes from all business such as waste disposal, etc. They recruit children to work as lookouts for their drug business. They corrupt people with money and death threat. The list go on and on.The book is more gripping and terrifying."
3,AM I RATING THE MOVIE OR THE DELIVERY PROCESS?,"I LOVE THIS GENRE! THIS MOVIE SUCKED. AFTER I WAS DONE WATCHING IT, I PUT IT IN THE CASE AND PUT THE CASE IN THE GARBAGE. THE MOVIE WAS DELIVERED EARLY. THE SERVICE GET 5 STARS AND THE MOVIE GETS ONE STAR."
1,This Ain't No Goodfellas,"This film failed on so many levels that it's hard to summarize its shortcomings. Suffice to say that lack of cohesiveness OR character development resulted in a totally unsatisfying film experience. I'm stunned that Scorsese was willing to lend his name to this production (though interestingly you WON'T find his name anywhere on the DVD case/notes). The reviews I read suggested this was a greater showcase of the ""reality"" of the so-called mafia, and that may be true...the real mafia likely consists of uneducated thugs with little to look forward to, and absolutely no sense of the value of human life. Unfortunately, such characteristics do NOT a good movie make. I'd pass on this one, and wait until Scorsese decides to make another ""unreal"" crime flick."
4,Odd film to say the least.,Not terribly moralistic. Not slick. A slice of life film. Just hopefully lives you never come in contact with.
4,did not meet high expectations,"Although this product was of good quality, it did not deliver on what I thought could have been a great italian mafia movie."
3,Not as great as I was led to believe.,"The 'real' mafia. This story is often uneven. I had a difficult time following it. Overall, it reminded me of The Children of God, that unsettling movie from Brasil a few years back. The extras are more fascinating. I would rent it."
1,Waited too long to check it out!,"Unfortunately, the DVD would not play in my system. By the time I found out, it was too late to return it. Sure would like to have watched it though."
1,Totally Overrated,"I was really excited to see this when it came out in the theaters. So I saw it and cameout of theater with the realization that it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen.Why? Well starts out promising but it's a terribly written and directed movie. Completelydisjointed, following no narrative and leaving characters unlinked story-wise.Action scenes were done well but overall it doesn't work. It's not inspiring or worthboasting about."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! DVD did NOT WORK!!!,I ordered this VERY EXPENSIVE Blu-ray DVD Order Total: $42.93 and it does not work! We went to several stores to check it on different equipment and NOTHING!!!I definitley will NOT order from here again!!! :([[ASIN:B001W8KXOM Gomorra ( Gomorrah )
1,Very poor quality.,"I have the top plastic part break two times. Customer service with black and decker is really bad.Go for the REAL Juiceman Jay Kordich that costs around $300 but way better quality.Even better is the Norwalk Juicer, but costs $2500.In summary don't waste your money in this juicer."
1,Waste of money,"Used the product 4 times, and on the fourth try the motor stopped working. Furthermore I wouldhave to run the grindings thru to get more juice. Makes more mess and is not worth the cost. Thestrainer is very difficult to clean although a wire brush helps. I bought for myselfas well as to give as a gift, and would be embarrassed to give as a gift it is so bad. The partwhere the juice goes in has to be held or it will slide away.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOT WORTH IT AT ANY PRICE."
5,4+yrs and still up and running,"This is my 3rd juicer of this price range in the last 10 years. Probably I have it 5 or 6 years, and I am not quite sure about that. I do not use it much. I am not sure if there is of a better quality, price. It is productive and that's all I need. I can only say that I am satisfied as it suits my now and then needs wery well."
4,Great Juicer serves my needs,"I borrowed a friends Juiceman JM400 Juiceman Jr for about a month, so I was familiar with the juicer. Then shopped here for one. Purchased a re manufactured one for an amazing price and have not been disappointed. Mine was half the price of my friends and it runs quieter than hers. It was shipped fast and arrived much quicker then they stated it would. Very pleased with this purchase and who it was purchased from."
1,Worthless customer service,"Our Juiceman died (something electronic). You can NEVER get anyone on the phone, and when you email them to try to reseove it it is like chasing your own tail. ZERO help. Do not buy these products!"
5,I REALLY LIKE THIS JUICER!!!,"I HAD A REALLY OLD JUICEMAN JR. JUICER AND I REALLY LIKED IT. I WANTED A LITTLE BIGGER JUICER. I LOVE THIS JUICEMAN JM400 JUICER. I LIKE IT BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE. YOU CAN PUT WHOLE FRUIT IN IT AND MY LAST ONE I HAD TO CUT THE FRUIT UP. THIS HAS TWO SPEEDS, MY LAST ONE ONLY HAD ONE. IT WORKS GREAT!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!"
2,unhappy,"The 1st 2 months it worked great, but the 3rd month the motor started making loud noise and a lot of shaking. So now I am stuck with a machine that doesn't work. Don't invest in it. Rather get something more durable that will last longer. I have to actually call customer service and see if they can replace it!"
1,The worst juicer ever,"I am so disappointed with this machine. I bought this juicer 1.5 years ago. It was not used often, only once or twice a week. One day it just stopped working, we didn't drop it or anything, everything was set the same way, but it just didn't react when we turned it on. I have no idea what went wrong, the juicer has not been used heavily nor it is broken, just pissed me off. DON NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH, IT IS BETTER TO BUY A QUALITY THING FOR A HIGHER PRICE THAN TROUBLE YOUR NERVES."
3,The Juice People strike again...,"Decided to try this as an entry level juicer before looking at a masticator down the road. Not reassuringly sturdy, so down the road might not be too far off. That said, made short work of some hard veggies in a fast and efficient manner.Per those people who noted they paid higher prices in the real world, you can persuade them to price match. I did. I was not so lucky trying to price match the Omega masticator in a real store. Omega distribution seems to have a hard, fast clamp on price across the board. Hence the arrival of the Juiceman 2 Jr. chez nous. We'll see how it do...."
1,It caught on fire.,The second time I juiced with it ...I juiced 20 small apples and it caught on fire. I returned it for my money back.
1,Died after 5 uses,"The Juiceman worked great ... until it suddenly stopped working! I had been juicing nothing but carrots and I juiced enough to make about a quart at a time. Today when I plugged in the juicer and turned the power on it didn't come on. I disassembled it and then reassembled it just to make sure I didn't have anything hooked up wrong, and still nothing happened when I switched on the power. I'll be returning it tomorrow for a refund and I'll look at another brand. I really wish things like this were made in the USA!"
5,Very efficient easy to use and clean!,"I love this juicer!!! My husband and I immediately tried it when we received it two days ago. It's so easy to assemble and use I only had to look at the parts page of the manual once! So far we have tried lots of carrots, apples and only needed to use the Low setting. It's got enough power for juicing these fruits. Tried grapefruit (without skin of course) and that worked perfectly. Same for pears. Blueberries were great too but they come out kinda like puree so you would want to intersperse blueberrie with high juice producing carrots or apples so it has an easier time going through the juicer. Very easy to clean, mostly warm water, little soap and the brush that comes with it is handy. I just left the pieces to dry and then assemble them back when they're dry. Love this product and highly recommend it."
1,Broke in 6 days,I am very disappointed with the juiceman juicer. My wife bought it for my birthday on march the 2nd and by March 8th it was not working at all. I called all day to reach customer service and no one picked up. Finally the automated voice on the customer line let me leave a message because I was on hold so long. No one called me back. I finally emailed them and I am still waiting to here back from them. My overall experience is very disappointed. I was really excited about this gift to only to be let down hard.
4,Classic,"I love this story. In fact I love anything Christmasy, but this one in particular is hard to find, so I had to grab it when I saw Amazon was offering it."
5,GREAT!,"I loved this book! It involved a lot of different aspects, leaving you to piece together the puzzle parts. I especially enjoyed the way it really flowed from one chapter to the next. I, also, feel that it was really easy to connect to written more from a younger stand point. I think that this book is deffinantly worth reading."
4,"A Younger, East-Coast Brett Easton Ellis","This is the story of a non-typical drug dealer named White Mike, who is somewhat reminiscent of the adolescent [drug] dealer from American Beauty, and a series of events involving his friends and aquaintences that ends in violence and bloodshed. The story is told through several points of view and flows right along making this a very quick, and entertaining, read.I was surprised to learn that Nick McDonell is quite young, having just enrolled in Harvard sometime around the publishing of this book I believer. I am quite impressed with his writing abilities and plan on buying any further works he publishes in the future."
4,Better than what they say....,"If you judge the author as an inexperienced child author, you will not like this book. People are biased against it because the author is so young even though the book is very well written. It tells a great story in a small time frame and is very accurate to a rich Manhattan kid's lifestyle. This story can teache you a lot if you are willing to listen to what it's saying."
4,a good image of the modern society,"i liked the book because the style of nick mcdonnell is good and easy to read. sometimes the description of the characters is really rude, but it just shows the reality of the kids in new york. in the end, it becomes a bit unrealistic and too cruel. however, the end matches with the story.many people may say that the book does not show life as it is, but i think it does!"
4,Twelve,"I was the same age as the author when I read this, and I remember the intense anger I felt that Mr.McDonell beat me to the punch. That being said I really enjoyed this novel, although it is terribly derivative and makes no new strides in the examination of privileged youth culture. If you have read Less Than Zero or even The Rules of Attraction, this book is old hat. If not, I suggest you skip Less Than Zero and read this. The narrative is much more purposed and streamlined than Ellis's bloated rant. This book is fun and violent, if simplistic. Recommended for readers of McDonell's own age."
3,"Spare, yet compelling","You'll finish this book in about three hours. It moves at a lightning fast pace due to a noticeable lack of description, minuscule chapters, and plenty of white space on the page. While the book is very surface-oriented, one has to keep in mind that it is meant to be a satire, and shouldn't be taken all that seriously. The denouement is a bit abrupt and not surprising given what's been in the news over the last several years. But in the end, McDonell moves the story along, ties several smaller plotlines together, and makes you want to finish the book. And isn't that the point - to make you want to finish the book?"
1,That was four hours of my life I will never get back....,"The editorial reviews for this book are good. I thought they may be a little optimistic - trying to give a new, young author a little boost. I wanted to like this book for that same reason. I was sorely disappointed. I found the story to be choppy and rather pointless. Completely without value. Am I being harsh? Probably. Given the number of outstanding, average, and mediocre books out there, I resent wasting even a moment of my time reading a truly horrible one.So, I say to the professionals who reviewed this book: What about the rest of us? It is nice of you to give this young man a little ego boost, but based on your reviews, hundreds of people wasted their valuable time and money. Send me a list of books you liked so I know not to read them!"
1,"Oh, The Irony!","A pampered rich-boy complete with silver spoon uses his wealth and privilege to get his first book published, a book about the evils of wealth and privilege. This is what Webster is changing their definition of ""irony"" to in their next edition."
3,Mediocre,"McDonell has a gift for prose at least, which is what makes this book worth reading. Even at its least inspired, the sketchiness of the plot is papered over by a tapestry of words that can really spin you away. Still, the plot isn't there, and neither are the characters. The voice is smart and caustic but superior ......"
3,Less Than Zero With Punctuation,"Nick McDonell takes us inside the drug-infested, excessive, bored lives of New York's wealthiest young kids. No doubt some of these kids could end up as college students in The Secret History, if only. The ""if only"" part is for you to discover.A tragic, one-day read. Perhaps it's even more of a tragedy because we're all so familiar with this tale by now."
1,Curiousity Killed the Cat,"I paid full retail for this novel because of all the hype, and yes, I will admit, I was curious about the lives of rich New York kids.Suffice to say, I am literally poorer for my effort.For a first novel, it's not bad, especially when you bear in mind the fact that the author was in his teens when he wrote it.However, many teens write books. Few, if none, have the connections necessary to get their books published. After reading Twelve, I am convinced that that is a good thing."
2,Twelve,"This book is of average worth. I don't think it was anything special. Any well educated 18 year old with some time on his or her hands could have written it. The only reason he got this book published is because his father is the Managing Editor of Sports Illustrated (now thats a typical private school kid).If you want to read a long high school essay, this book is for you."
3,"Ending is predictable...thoughtful, truthful novel","This book started out really well...then crashed and burned. If it wasn't for the sorry ending, I would've rated it with 4 stars. Many of the characters the book follows were of no interest and did not really relate to the underlying story. The individual stories of addiction are truthful."
4,"Firstly, hard to read - finally, hard to put down.","I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I first started reading 'Twelve', but I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. At first I really struggled with the way it was written - it was like nothing I had come across before. However, the more and more I delved into each page, the more I was hooked. It was amazing how the author showed the entanglement of people's lives, bringing new meaning to ""it's a small world"". It was absolutely fascinating how the story came to a head and proved that there are always consequences to every action you make. Read it!"
1,trite rich kid junk,"this book didn't deserve to be published. perhaps it had something to do with the fact that the 18-year-old author's godfather is president of Grove Atlantic, the house that published the book, and his parents are famous authors and magazine editors--you think?the writing is pathetic--every single chapter starts with a character's name. this is freshman writing 101. the author has no idea what he's writing about, either; the book is rife with implausibilities (an utterly unconvincing drug trip; a kid who buys machine guns from a corner store; a pampered white kid sent to a NYC jail and finding out that it's 'not so bad'--HA!).The characters are poor, too--it's impossible to tell them apart, to tell who's who. Important character info is lazily withheld until late in the book (the protagonist is a bird enthusiast? what?), when the author was running out of things to say and needed to take up some pages. don't waste your money on this garbage."
2,"Better than ""An Expensive Education"" but not by much","I read ""An Expensive Education"", which I thought was terrible. I decided to give this book a try because of all the rave reviews. I only have two positive things to say about this book. Number one is that it was short. I started it on my commute home on a Thursday and finished it on my commute in on a Friday. Secondly, it was a more familiar subject for the author, wealthy Manhattan teens, so the situations and characters made more sense than the ones in ""An Expensive Education."" Overall, it was a snoozefest. Nothing interesting happened and the characters were shallow brats. I hate that it was made into a movie. It is also no surprise to me that the author's godfather was the publisher. hmmm."
3,Pleasently suprised,"I really couldn't believe this book was written by a 17 year old. It kept me turning pages and wanting to finish the book. I enjoyed the journey. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good ""dark"" story, but yet a light read."
3,twelve review by NT64 gloucester high school student,"Twelve is a story about a 17 year old high school drop out, by the name of white Mike (main character in the story) whos mom died a few years back. White Mike now chooses to sell drugs to make money even though he is rich. This story takes place in New York City on the five days leading up to news years. This story has a lot of characters and jumps around from character to character, until the end of the story when all the characters paths meet at an unforgetable new years party. I liked this novel and thought it was a good story but i think the author could have spent a little more time on the ending. Definitly a good book for high school students to read. If you have read this story i suggest you read the novel Rule Of The Bone by Russel Banks. and watch the movie Requiem for a Dream directed by Darren Aronofsky."
2,Aww poor little rich kids!,"So, like we're like totally supposed to relate to these heartless, ""suffering"" affluent teens? Hardly. And why does Nick Mcdonell constantly add those cliche ""teenager"" words..for example, ""like...totally...etc.."" I heard he was an excellent teen author, but if he was he would know those words are quite unnecessary and help to get few points across except that people are dolts. I don't know, it just seems like ""Twelve"" lets the readers down. There is little plot, except that perhaps race means more than it should and that money corrupts. Wow, like we didn't already know the latter comment before we read this book.The book seems as if it wants to invoke sympathy, but doesn't quite hit its mark. Instead, I almost felt resentment that people with so much can do so little with it. What a waste--in more ways than one."
5,Don't knock it...,"Nick McDonell is mature beyond his years and ""Twelve"" shows this. If you never lived in the city, you won't understand most of what he writes about. I couldn't put this book down at all. It was hypnotic and very compelling. You feel for ""White Mike"" and wonder what would make him...happy. I grew up in the Bronx and I wasn't anywhere close to being rich as the characters were in this book, but city people have connections and I connected with this story, the environment and these ""lost"" children. The ending was very good and not sugar-coated for the sake of the reader's morals. The story was written the way it should feel, purely real."
5,A great first novel,"Ignore the literary critics bashing of this book. Its a entertaining, quick read and well worth it. I think this kid has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to his next book.Twelve lacks the pretentiousness of the books its compared to-Less than Zero, etc..."
1,The worst book I have ever read in my life.,"I apologize for not being impressed that a 17 year old can publish a book. But horrible writing is horrible writing regardless the age of the author. It inspired me to write a book because if this can get published, anything can."
2,Why isn't my father rich and powerful?,"If bloodlines is what it takes to get published, I guess I'm out of luck. This is a book that has one interesting character and he's a bum. That's too bad, since this book is about non-descript rich kids slumming during Christmas break. If these New York City kids think they have it bad because there's too much pressure to spend too much of their parents' money, maybe the should write their angst down in a college-ruled note book and give it to their shrinks instead of begging their fathers to get them to publish the dreck they scribble. No character development, no plot, no emphathy, and no style and up to a just-above-unreadable book. Don't waste your time."
1,It's amusing how...,"...of the reviews that are posted for this book, most of the positive ones are from teens who say ""I loved it! It was wonderful! I couldnt put it down!"" and never discuss the merits of the book, while people who hated it tend to get down to details, like the horrible sentence structure, poor plot construction, tendency of the characters to blend into each other and be indistinguishable, and pathetic mimicry of Bret Easton Ellis. Oh yeah, and the utterly ridiculous ending. There is not an ounce of originality in this book. Save your money--don't support bad writing OR nepotism. (Or necrophilia for that matter, but that's a story for another day.)"
2,So so,"McDonell himself said in THE OBSERVER, ""It's like I'm on top of this monstrous mountain of nepotism."" Which is true. His father has been an editor of top magazines, his mother is a novelist, his godfather OWNS the company that published TWELVE, and the quotes on the book jacket are all writers who are family friends. This book would not have seen the light of day without those connections. The book is well written FOR A 17 YEAR OLD. But one should not make accomodations for age when laying down money for a book. It's puerile--as might be expected--and half-baked. And contrived. And the writing isn't great, only good. McDonell has been compared to Bret Easton Ellis (another rich kid). I never liked Bret Easton Ellis, either. So if you like him, maybe you'll like this."
1,Lack of talent meets sicking nepotism: whee!,"As a college student, I felt embarassed for my generation when I read this miserable book. There are better writers on every block of Manhattan than Nick McDonell. Absolutely pathetic. Great to know that his godfather published the book, though, and his dad got it promoted.Joan Didion came to my school a few months ago and gave a talk. At one point, during questions afterward, I asked her point blank why she gave blurbs to books that it seems hard to imagine she could have had any respect for whatsoever. (I didn't mention Twelve by name, but I haven't noticed her name on many other books, and certainly none as wretched as this garbage.) There was a pause and then she sighed and said, ""You get trapped into it. Old friends ask, and you don't want to put a sour note in decades of friendship because you wouldn't write a sentence or two.""Joan Didion is old friends with Nick McDonell's father."
3,"This is isn't 12, it's less than zero","For all of the hype of this protagonist being Holden Caulfield of our days, I can't help but think it is hauntingly familiar to Bret Easton Ellis's Less Than Zero. Twelve compares to Less Than Zero in many ways: the drugs, the sex, even the authors were young adults when they wrote the novels.I am always in search of the great protagonist-driven literature and this was not it. Not bad for a first effort, it comes off overcompensating in the angst department. And after a while it started to grate on my nerves. I felt the McDonell was trying to hard at the despair thing, or that he really is down and out."
1,At least I finished it....,"I'm the only one I know who picked up this book and read the whole thing. While White Mike is interesting as a pro(?)tagonist, this book is a Jay McInerney meets Brett Easton Ellis meets Tama Janowitz nightmare. While the author demonstrates a nice grasp of language, his characters are superficially drawn (as well as being superficial) stereotypes that wander through a book until its complete cliched, trite, ridiculous, cop-out ending. American youth needs a voice, but this guy isn't it. All he does is show what the parents in the Nanny Diaries produced, but at least the Nanny Diaries is entertaining. Please, oh higher being, don't let this become a movie."
3,Not 11 but 12,"Nick has prose similiar to Ellis, but cannot compete (he was 17 a the time of publication) at his level just yet. Writing about rich kids that have drugs, guns, and endless amounts of money at their fingertips, Twelve allows the reader to see another side of upper Manhattan, a teen agers literal perspective if you will. A nice read for a first novel, look for better work to come from this young man."
1,At least the spelling is okay,"Is there a plot? I must have missed it. The writing isn't too bad, but unfortunately, there's no story."
3,East Coast Less Than Zero Rip-Off,"I get that the author was 17 when he wrote this...and for 17 -- bang up job! But looking at this novel without the author info leaves a lot to be desired. It's a story of White Mike, a clean-living drug dealer & the events during the last week of December culminating in a big open-house party. The episodic plot was a bit lackluster, the scenes a bit choppy, and the characters were interesting, but a little shallow (maybe that was done on purpose, but I couldn't help wanting more). Perhaps this book is meant more for the high school reader -- one who didn't already read this book better written by Bret Easton Ellis."
3,teenage testimony indeed,"nick mcdonell wrote 'twelve' when he was seventeen, and as much as i hate to hold that against him, it is quite apparent that the novel was written by a seventeen-year-old. at first this works in his favor; 'twelve' is incredibly fast paced (fairly typical of first time novelists) and relatively well developed. there was a brutal honesty that was a true testimony of what it's like to a be a teenager with too much time and money. i actually enjoyed it up to the very end. but in the course of the final three pages of the novel mcdonell spoiled all of his efforts with an anti-climactic finale that becomes the harsh reminder that the story was composed by a seventeen-year-old. things are very neatly tied up, i will give him that much, but the ending was too easy and it seems like mcdonell could have done more since he did so much leading up to that point. i was disappointed, but that may just be a matter of preference."
4,A Second Opinion.,"This book was good reading. In fact, I read it all in one sitting. I was able to identify with most of the characters and, as an urban 17 year old myself, I can honestly say that these characters aren't fake- people like that do exist. But sadly, it is hard for any writer to develop so many characters in 256 pages, though McDonell does give it the ole varsity try.While I don't live in ""The City,"" I was able to understand it through McDonell's writing. He threw out some beautiful images which were so obviously original, both in content and style, that it is hard to call his work cliched or hypocritical. By the by, I do not think that it is appropriate for a review to reveal the books ending... at least I'm glad that I read this book before I read cantbebothered's unfair review."
3,Lost in the Rush,"Many reviews of this book are complaining about it's plot or lack thereof, and the fast pace with which McDonell breezes through his story.However, this novel does possess many redeeming values. For one, it accurately represents the teenagers of the city. Most teenagers could recognize the Timmys or Mark Rothko's of their world. They know the Sarah Ludlows. Chris is the typical insecure teenage male, willing to host a party of proportions he would normally be uncomfortable with for the attention of Sarah. Andrew and Jessica could also be found in any high school across America.The dialog is also realistic. The conflict between Hunter and Nana is typical.The novel only fails with its ending. Claude's motivation is unclear and rushed.McDonell's first attempt is definitely worth a read."
5,Great Book!!!,"This book was very entertaining and an easy read. I am not an avid reader but i read this book in a couple hours. I thought the different characters in the book went well together and the overall message was great. I would recommend it to everyone. I am sad that it was only 250 pages, i wanted more by the end."
3,Nintendo Ending,"Good start, wonderful structuring (did he have heavy editorial help or is he a natural writer?), and a fun read UNTIL you get to the end, which is facile and straight out of a video game or TV."
4,Great Novel Set in New York,"Twelve is a modern-day Catcher in the Rye. Set in Manhattan, like ""Catcher,"" Twelve follows a group of wealthy, alienated teenagers who are unknowingly moving together towards a violent and bloody climax.The novel is told in a series of vignettes. The main character is White Mike. He is a drug dealer, but highly likeable.It is hard to believe that Twelve was written by a seventeen-year old boy. Like another young author, Carson McCuller, he possesses almost clairvoyant insight of people's innermost thoughts, fears, and desires. McCuller and McDonell both write about life as you might expect from a much older, experienced person. McDonell also has a gift for writing. He writes about New York, the city life that has helped alienate all these kids."
1,Can't believe it lasted so long!,"McDonell's grammar is straight and to the point. His story, on the other hand, is not.Throughout the entire novel, scenes happen and stop abruptly and they piece slowly together and then unravel, and then piece together and unravels again. nothing is ever fully connected, and the end is choppy and unsatisfying.However, there's little phrases that are really thought provoking and good, but trust me, it's a very rare find in this book."
1,My Opinion,"Wow. Mr. Nick can describe a girl in too-tight jeans, a black northface shell and a prada bag on the prowl for drugs. That, sorry to say it, is the extent of his talent. :( But cheers for standing out in the cold and observing!Thus, Mr. Nick, and the ""fictional"" world he has ""created"", is merely another fine example of an exaggeration of the tales from the city lifestyle for teens. His knowledge obviously comes from story upon rumor upon and upon (etc), for if he were really ""in the know"" he would never have written such a tale published by his GRANDFATHER. This book is the ""coming of age"" equivalent of last week's People magazine.From a girl who has been there, but oh-so-sadly missed the bloodbath ending, I recommend you wait for the next magazine article (like last fall's ""W"") that claims to have the inner ""scoop""- atleast that will have pictures."
1,Pathetic,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It never would have been published if the teenage author's godfather, Morgan Entrekin, didn't own the publishing company, Grove Atlantic. It doesnt hurt that his father, Terry McDonell, is a publishing name as well in the magazine industry.The book itself is tripe. It's hilariously padded out to almost 250 pages, but in reality it should be about 90. The characters are empty, the sentences are poorly and simplistically constructed, and there are no original ideas ANYWHERE in the book. It makes me angry to think that this even touched a publisher's desk."
1,Nepotism at its finest.,"I don't understand the hype about this book. The writing style was amateurish. The ending was telegraphed right from the start, the only shocking think was just how over the top it was. The only reason this manuscript wasn't thrown in the trash where it belongs, is clearly because of his father who just happens to be the editor of Sports Illustrated."
1,"""Twelve"" degrees of separation","The publisher's his godfather, his dad writes for Sports Illustrated, and mom's a novelist. This is a lot like going to your friends' house and being subjected to their precious child clunking away on the grand piano as they watch worshipfully.Lesson: you don't have to have talent, just family connections... and he's not even a Bush."
2,"OK, but I wouldn't waste your time with it.","Not bad, but well, not good either. I didn't like this book much at all. For a start, McDonell created characters that I didn't care about... something that is probably the most important job for a writer. If we don't care about a character, why should we care about their story? People say that this book is brilliant because it expresses ""the vapid, materialistic society which we grow up in today. The sheer lack of emotions and depth is what represents many people"". I would argue that yes it does do this, but it doesn't make this book brilliant. I think these elements could be expressed in a much better way.The ending.. well, I wont ruin it for you, but I don't think it was shocking enough, or whatever effect McDonell was trying to create. Infact, it felt like a rip off, like an easy way out. LIke how Alice just ""woke up"". OK book, but atleast it is short so you can throw it away quickly and be done with it."
2,Some memories are best left in the past.,"Having never been given Hoist as a kid 20 years ago, I had to wait two decades to get him. Hoist is for the collector or nostalgic fan only. His transformation is not that great, and his robot is somewhat lame. Like most G1 Transformers, his missles do not shoot, and its easy to misplace his parts He does have nice balance, so he will be wonderful as a shelf. But if you want him to actually play with, you should forego him."
5,A must for all fans,"This collection of Jane Austens letters is a must for all fans who would like a peek inside the mind of the author. It is the most extensive collection to date and Le Faye has done quite a lot to make it as accessible as possible. It features all of the surviving letters from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra plus some letters to some of her brothers, a niece, etc. It also includes three letters from Cassandra to various relatives from the time immediately after Jane Austens death and so also shows Jane Austen from another persons perspective. The only drawback of this book is that all the notes are in the back, arranged by the number of each letter, and so you find yourself flipping back and forth quite a lot but it is an annoyance well worth putting up with.I have read quite a few bibliographies on Jane Austen but there is no competing with her own words. If you have any kind of interest in Jane Austen as a person then you should definitely get this book."
2,Are these two different books?,"Being one of those who received this book only to be completely disappointed when the pages fell out, I turned to the Amazon reviews to see if others were disappointed as well. Having read the reviews, I am completley confused. I think these are two different books! My book is 112 pages, has no bibliography, no editor's notes, nothing outside of the letters themselves. I can't even find an editor's name! It is published by Pavilion Press, Philadelphia in 2003.As I read the reviews of people who love the book, they describe a completely different book.What gives?"
1,Get the Deirdre Le Faye Edition Instead,"I originally bought this volume thinking it was the edited full volume of letters. Instead, it was a small volume with a very poor binding that did not have any notations. Spend the extra money and get the edited volume of letters by Deirdre Le Faye (which is the third edition of the volumes of letters originally edited by R. W. Chapman). That volume includes notations/footnotes on all the letters and a biographical and topographical index. Fortunately since the book binding was defective and there were colored stains on several pages, Amazon took this back and gave me a refund. I bought the Le Faye letters used through Amazon for about the same price."
2,Shoddy treatment of such valuable things!,"I dare not argue with the importance of Jane Austen's letters, nor with the pleasure to be obtained by reading them. This edition, however, is the poorest-bound book I have ever seen! I just received it in the mail, and the copyright page has already fallen out. The margins are equally dismal, and I am afraid one reading will finish the whole thing off. Buy this edition if you must, but find a better copy if you can."
3,Quality of actual book could've been much better,"I love Jane Austen, so reading through her letters - and getting a glimpse into the mind of such an amazing person - was fantastic. I only want to warn potential buyers that this book is very poorly manufactured. I only got to the second letter before the first page literally FELL OUT - and I'm an avid reader and know how to care for my books - and subsequently more pages have followed. I realize the book is only $9.95 new, but one would expect that it would at least stay 'together' for that price. Other than that, it's brilliant - just don't sit outside or near a fan while reading."
3,good contents but poor presentation,"It's great to have such a compilation of Jane Austen's Letters, but unfortunately the edition I bought looks like a xerox photocopy more than a book. It's difficult to discover it when it's an internet purchase. Thank God it was for myself and not a gift, 'cause I'd be a little ashamed to give it to someone else..."
2,Incomplete,"There are letters that were in the original publication of the same name, that are not present in this edition."
3,Disintegrating letters.,"I had already read Jane Austen's letters but wanted to have my own copy. They give a fascintating insight into her life, although somewhat limited by the fact that her sister Cassandra burnt all of Jane's leters to her after Jane's death. Unfortunately the copy I have recently bought is poorly bound and the pages started coming loose the first time I opened it. I just couldn't be bothered returning the book from New Zealand."
5,A baseball collector's keepsake!,"My favorite sports is baseball, so reviewing this book was an easy choice. As with all books that rank the best of all time, the listing are subjective, although this list is very close to my personal choices. Sporting News is a respected name and that adds credibility to the book.Starting with Babe Ruth, as most baseball ranking do, right to number 100 Early Wynn, there are stories, photos and quotes that make this book one the best. I was impressed by the vast collection of pictures throughout the book.The book has a top 100 timeline of players, the All Time top 10 selections lists, all decade teams, top100 breakdowns and a top 100 quiz included in the book as well. For every baseball fan and purest, this would make the prefect gift or collectors item.A great addition to my library, a book that I will share with my children for years to come, Baseball's 100 Greatest Players needs only to add a video to make the set complete!"
1,Needed some work.,I agree with the review written by Terrell. This had the potential to be a good book but the story line wasn't developed and you never got to know about the characters. Ms. Wallace gave you bits and pieces as to why things were happening but it wasn't enough to make the book satisfying. This book is not a keeper.
1,Confused,"Sad to say this is the first time in 30+ years that I had to take a book and throw it in the closet. ""Mark of the Werewolf"" begins like the first 80 pages have been eliminated and your starting in the middle. The characters were not integrated into the novel they seemed to just jump out at you at the most peculiar moment. Not worth the $.. dollars invested."
5,Review Of Gospel According to Ruth,"An excellent book - which demonstrates the providence of God in the ""little"" nuances of life. Dr. Campbell's wisdom and insight makes this a captivating read. I could not put the book down. It is also a great little study guide for a SS or Bible Study class."
2,Takes some studying ...,"This is a very nice book based on Ukrainian culture, but it definitely takes some studying to piece it together. The writer creatively utilizes a vast number of presentation methods -- sort of piece milled. Recommended for those who have some Ukrainian background. Otherwise, plan on spending some time figuring out the connections."
2,Pretty but chip very easily,"We've been through three sets of these, replaced once by Amazon and once by Dansk. They're pretty to look at but chip very easily. We're very careful with them and the most recent set we got might be a little more chip resistant.5/14/07 UPDATE: The chipping has improved markedly, and I can only imagine that at least one of the sets was defective, and that slowly we've gone through the most vulnerable pieces. I would add to what I have above that these dishes get very hot in the microwave so I'd add that as a concern especially if you have children using them."
3,dansk aruba,"I am happy with the ""look"" of this stoneware. It was very hard to find bright, primary colors when I was looking. The large mixing bowl chipped (on the bottom where you can't see it) when I was sliding it along my tiled countertop. I read other reviews that said it chips easily. I haven't had them very long so I hope that this chip was a one-time incident and not a result of the workmanship. They also get a lot hotter than my old set of stoneware did when I put them in the microwave. Overall, I'm satisfied, I just hope that I'm not replacing them in the next year. My old set was pfalztgraff which never chipped. If I could have seen these in person I probably would have bought another set of Pfaltzgraff instead."
5,What angels must sound like...,"I will cut this short.. Streich has the most beautiful voice and tone, I in all likelihood will ever lend an ear to... (...Save that of an Angel, should I by some strange coincidence be allowed into heaven...) This compilation magnificantly dokcuments Streich's vocal talents in the more light-hearted repetoire, and it is a gem.. Get it!"
3,remote controll submarine,"The toy is very cool, but also very delicate. Some pieces break easily. My son has lots of fun with it."
2,Some of the answers are wrong,"And simple math answers too. For example, (1/2)(2/3) = ? They say it's 1/6. I'm of the opinion that it's actually 1/3. That's just one of several I've ran across.Still, it's better than nothing, but I think looking at your old college textbooks and doing the ETS questions is probably a better route."
1,Terrible,"I wasn't going to add another bad review (although it deserves many :0), but I noticed nobody mentioned that not only is it a terrible survey, but some answers are incorrect as well!My university offered a course to prep for the GRE- for which this was the text. All of us, professor included, realized quite quickly to trash it and throw some ETS practice tests up on the overhead!"
1,Many typos and wrong calculation,"This book has many questions and detailed solution. However, it contains many typos and wrong calculations. I do not recommend this book to anyone who's trying to be prepared for the GRE physics."
1,Less than 1 stars would be perfect,"Honestly, unless you happen to have some money in need of wasting, as well as a lot of time before your Physics GRE, don't even think of this piece of c**p. It is the single most unhelpful book I have ever come across. The questions in here don't even go close to the real Physics GRE questions or difficulty level, and the answers are more often meaningless than correct.[...]"
1,Horrible Book,Many of the answers they provide are simply wrong. The content does not match the actual Physics GRE material.
2,don't buy this book,"I can hardly believe that this book got published with as many errors and problems as it has. He has the definition of torque defined BACKWARDS! It has too many constants in Coulomb's law. The notation is not standard and some of the solved problems don't make any sense. Save yourself some money and borrow this from a friend or the Physics department, and just go through your old texts and do problems from it."
1,Really bad,"Gee whiz, this is just a not so great book. The problems are much harder than the actual GRE and test abstruse stuff and your knowledge of specific equations. The review in the front I guess is sort of okay in that it lists a lot of differents equations that might be helpful. But the questions are terrible."
1,Worthless,"This book is a waste of time. As others have pointed out, the review is less than ten pages of useless physics, while the problems come nowhere near what the actual physics GRE is like. To actually prepare for the physics GRE though, I recommend reviewing your textbooks, working additional problems from there, and getting a few Schaum's outlines, which have tons of solved and unsolved problems and a good review. Then take the actual ETS tests timed to get used to the strategy of fast-paced multiple choice."
2,Not Worth It,"Most the problems in the book I have never seen and I've done well in undergraduate physics. Maybe five or six problems I could answer easily. Many also say that this doesn't represent the real GRE. Also there is a great deal of obscure letters used for different physical quantities that aren't used a great deal in pre-graduate physics. Also when they use the obscure letters they don't even tell you what it is (like kinetic energy, lenght, etc.). Basically just go over your undergraduate books and study from them"
1,this book is absolutely horrible,"this is my first and probably last review.this book is a _waste_of_time_. the problems are interesting, but are too time consuming, tend to be esoteric, and worst of all have almost nothing to do with the physics gre.the review section is much worse. it's characterized by bad, unconventional notation, wrong definitions(!!), and very incomplete coverage of important concepts.don't by this book, it's worthless."
3,Be Warned!,"This book (big purple) is notoriously bad among physics students in that it misrepresents itself as a GRE approximation. The questions are not bad, per. se., for other purposes (boning up for departmental boards, maybe), but are unrealistic for GRE problems (requiring too much time and depth of calculation). Still, the review sections do not seem to be bad. In essence, do not let big purple deter you from taking the Physics GRE: the GRE is really tough, but easy compared to Dr. Molitoris' book."
1,"Believe all the bad reviews, horrible GRE prep. AVOID!","I figured for only a few bucks I could risk ignoring the bad reviews and go ahead and get this book. Horrible decision! The practice questions are NOTHING like what's on the test--they require much more derivation and calculation than is feasible in the actual test. One of the most important things in prepping for the GRE Physics is learning the tricks of the test (dimensional analysis, order of magnitude, etc) which this book is useless for. Only potential saving grace is a somewhat (but not really) helpful few pages of review, but even that uses labeling so obscure that it's more hassle than it's worth. I've talked about this book with several other people, and they all agree it's a completely useless book. Do not waste your money."
1,Abysmal.,"As many have noted: riddled with errors, and irrelevant in so far as an actual GRE test goes. Don't waste your money, or more importantly your time, in dealing with this book. Get onto other physics study materials."
2,cheap but you could get the new one pretty cheap too,"and the new one actually has computerized stuff on it, and the notation in the text's formatting, extent is better.i spent like $8 bucks total (w/shipping) on this one and then like $17 total on the new one in ""used"" condition."
1,This book sucks,"Riddled with typos...and inconsistent and archaic notation are rife throughout this book. In addition, the review material doesn't correspond well with the practice test material. Most of the questions are pulled from material not found in the book's review. The author's thought process is not at all easy to follow when examining problem solutions. It's nice to have ""your own way"" of doing problems, but for crying out loud, you've written this book to help others, and it's not doing that at all. I doubt that many of my professors could've earned a passing grade on these stupid tests.I don't know where the ""Spotlight Reviewer"" got his credentials from, but this book is absolutely useless, and the amount of dissenting opinions here should make that abundantly clear. I will greatly enjoy burning this book after I successfully pass the Subject Exam *without* its help."
2,Extremely hard and containing a few errors,"This book contains 4 full-length GRE physics tests.There is absolutely no way to answer all the 100 questions within 170 minutes without a calculator. I find some questions extremely time-consuming and demanding.The first part where physics theory is reviewed is quiet poor. Don't rely on this material for your preparation, you will need much much more.I have detected both typing errors and a few wrong answers (containing wrong physics). If I knew, I would have bought another book to prepare myself.It's an ideal book to demolish your self-confidence."
2,This book is not that good.,"This book is not that effective in studying for the physics GRE. Most of the problems would NEVER be asked on a GRE (~70%). Only about 30% of the problems are useful, and I would say that the physics review is not even that good. To put things in perspective, I found the ETS book to be FAR more helpful, even though it contains no solutions and 3 tests. (As opposed to Molitoris which contains 4 tests with solutions.) Also, the solutions are filled with mistakes."
1,"inaccurate, hence waste your time catching errors.",Contains a lot of misprintings and mistakes. Solutions are often not economical enough for GRE test. Overview of material is bulky on simple points and does not cover a minimal scope. I would certainly recommend not to waste money on such a book.
1,Don't waste your money,"There are many other reviews saying exactly the same thing, so I'll keep this short and to the point. This is useless as a preparation for the GRE Physics subject test. Many of the questions require a calculator, which of course means they aren't very close to questions you can expect on the actual test. Some have argued that the book is still nice because it gives a concise summary of major topics which will be on the test, but really all it gives is lists of formulae. Assuming you've taken physics courses, you should have all this material in your textbooks and course notes anyway. There is absolutely no reason to spend your money on this book."
4,cover,the cover was not the right one for the case and it had been cut in half and you could see what it was from the edge
4,pillow,I love my jolly rancher pillow but i would not get it for little kids because sometimes they break and the little microfibers fall out
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!! lots of cool stuff,this toy is very durable and has many additions. including a speederbike that fits inside (sold sepertly) and it also has a very cool addition of clone troopers that have guns that attach on and do not fall off!!! all this and attached to the top is a handle for holding and it has 2 firing cannons this is a high qualitie toy buy it!!!
4,Nice Extra,"This is reasonable price , nice extra compilation (B singles 82-87 , Fish) for example with ""Six of One, Half-Dozen of the Other - A singles 82-92""Poor booklet."
4,A must for a Marillifreak,"A good, solid album, which actually contains the two first Marillion tunes I'd ever heard: Grendel and Freaks. Cinderella Search and Tux On are kind of weak, but the rest leave me with the feeling that they should have been the 3rd disk of The Thieving Magpie"
5,Witty Plus Pretty,"A review crammed with lovely songs, still relevant after all these years. They don't make Broadway musicals like this any more, unless Stephen Sondheim is involved....Excellent performers treating the lyrics with the respect they deserve. Loved every moment of it."
5,An undiscovered gem!!,"This recording was a chance purchase about 10 years ago in a NRM. 10 years later, my wife and I are still gaga over this collection. Included are tunes to make you laugh, cry and think. The performers are fabulous, and the songs memorable. Fabulous!!"
2,Too basic to do a good install,"This video is too simplistic. It assumes the do-it-yourself installer will have no problems with the process. This video should include things like; How to handle uneven floors, How to correct for gaps, How to cover stairs, Should the hardwood floor be stored in the room for several days before installation, etc."
2,History -- Or Fiction,"John Cairnes, a British contemporary economist of the time, wrote his work in 1862 attempting to explain how the Slave Power (the plantation aristocracy of the South) conspired over a period of 50 years prior to the Civil War to promote slavery as a protected, ""peculiar institution"" in the whole United States. Much of what Cairnes says is absolutely true and historically supported. Some of his contentions are subjective and can not be proven in fact or historical reflection. The introduction of the recent edition, written by Mark Smith, points out numerous errors and inconsistencies that crept into the work in 1862. John Cairnes, himself, is very redundant. He repeats his position and explanations to the point of distraction. Add the historical inconsistencies and this work is best suited as a research document for an experienced Civil War history afficiencado."
5,Eric Carmen Boats Against The Current,"""Boats Against the Current"" Is Eric Carmen at his finest. It blends Pop Ballads, Classical Music with string arrangements on half the songs and Piano and Power Rock into one heavenly sound that still sounds fresh even today. This can be said with most his albums but ""Boats"" worked the best. It is a crime that his CD's are only available on Japanese Imports... With the exception of his first album and his latest and a few greatest hits albums... you would think that the US Record companies would wake up and domesticly release all of his solo albums.. he only has a total of six. The Japanese Imports do a great job of doing him justice by supplying lyrics to all the songs in English and also in Japanese. The hits are the title track and ""She Did It"" but after a few listens you will be enjoying the other songs as well."
3,Standard patterns,No patterns really stuck out to me in this book but it is otherwise a nice updating of crochet for more modern-looking patterns.
3,Tops are designed too short,"Yep, the book has really nice designs layed out in a nice format. BUT be prepared to modify the patterns for the tops,(i.e. add rows), unless you are 14 years old, have a flat tummy and really like belly shirts. I,like many women, don't fit that category. Sigh. Not the biggest ordeal to add a few extra rows, but just be prepared to do it. I'm not sure how this type of modification will affect the shape of the tops."
3,"a bit frustrating, but I love the patterns","I agree with others that some of the stiches are a bit uncreative (and miles of them) but I am willing to change bits here and there, I do love the look of most of the patterns. I really struggled with the stole pattern (the only one I've made) and instructions could be MUCH clearer with the use of charts, such as in the Happy Hooker. For instance, there's a lot of ""skip next sc, skip next ch 1 sp, skip next dc, skip next ch 1 sp , sc in next dc"" type instructions where something like ""sc in middle of next shell"" would be so much easier and you wouldn't have to count through the entire friggin row. I rewrote the instructions but there's been a lot of frogging.I love the patterns though--a website with any errata would also be appreciated! I also love the look of the patterns in hot knits, but I haven't made any yet, so I don't know if that book has a similar issue.(btw, this account is under my dh's name, but he doesn't crochet ;-))"
3,Needs better yarn choices,Although this book has some great patterns in it. I think that it will definitely be worth the time of swatching and blocking with a lighter weight yarn for a less bulky look.Patterns are great!Yarn weight choices are bad.
4,Good selection of patterns,I like many of the designs in this book. Most use basic stitches to achieve attractive results.
1,Seriously Disappointing,This book is seriously disappointing. Long on endless lists of names and short on commentary and analysis. The book jumps around chronologically and repeats passages in a very odd way. Vigee Le Brun was a fascinating woman living in a fascinating point in history but you learn very little about her as a person from this book.
3,i rate it a six,"its a pretty good mix. i love tracks 5,10,and 11. these are a lock. track 10 is my favorite. can't wait for the III hit coming soon. get it."
5,funky sensibility fo' sho',i love it! i play it over and over! slammin ' mix of ecclectic trax! luscious!
3,They save a lot of work,They have been around for many years because they save a lot of work down the line.Wax drooling on candlesticks mean time cleaning when you could be doing something else.
3,Weak Conclusion,"I have a recollection of watching both miniseries ""Rage of Angels"" and its conclusion tale ""Rage of Angels: The Story Continues"" when they originally on NBC and really enjoying them. However, after recently buying both miniseries on Amazon & rewatching them, I was stuck by how flat the sequel is compared to the original miniseries. The movie once again has a strong cast & pretty well-developed characters, but the plotlines are choppy & somewhat lame and the main characters are not nearly as sympathetic this go around. ""Rage of Angels"" was really the peak. The continuing story is much more of a plateau."
1,could not have been worse,"very poor copy, in fact one cannot view it. I threw it away in any casenot good publicity for Amazon"
5,Wonderful baseball history fun,"Everyone in our family - the baseball and non baseball fans loved watching what baseball was like back in the silent films. Babe Ruth carving his own bat out of a limb, the players carrying their gloves on their belts, the cartoons are really funny and the short movie of an older man trying to win the heart of a rich lady by playing baseball - they are all well done and fun to watch. We laughed and laughed."
2,Worst sleigh ever,I ignored other reviews of this sleigh and bought it anyway because I couldn't believe it could be that bad. It arrived with one bent runner. Also poor workmanship. Split wood where screws went in. I was able to straiten the runner.We just had a snowfall so I tried out the sled today. With a baby riding (22 lbs) the sled travels on the back tip of the runners. The cross members act as snow plows. It would be easier to drag a cement block through the snow. I was very dissipointed as one reason I bought this was the brand name. I will be returning this.
5,great floats,my wife and I first used these a couple of times at a friends house and just thought they were the best. We do not like float mattress but these keep your body in the water.
5,water lounger,This is our second lounger of this type the other is still in great shape after five years. This is a great and comfortable product.
4,Best German Recording Available,"I have been looking for a CD of the entire opera, and I'm pleased to say that this CD set is incredible. From the snarling, sly and rumbling Josef Greindl, to the light, lyrical and ringing Maria Stader, every singer featured is in their vocal prime. The orchestra also plays spot-on and does not feel the least bit stilted or stiff. The recordings have also been cleaned up wonderfully; despite being recorded over 55 years ago, they sound fresh and brand-new with no tape hiss or distortion. I definitely recommend this CD set to anyone wanting a German recording of this magnificent opera."
5,Beautiful Mozart and Stader,OK it is in Mono. But once you have listened to this CD you will not want to go back to other versions of this Opera.Stader is fantastic. Performance of all singers and Ferenc Friscay are exemplary.
2,Didn't get it...,"I must have missed something here. I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this book but started to have my doubts about where it was going...which turned out to be nowhere, unfortunately. Comparisions to other phenomenal southern reading (ie. To Kill A Mockingbird) are certainly generous. It did have some sweet parts and was certainly a walk through a simpler time. But I guess I missed the point...actually I couldn't find a point."
1,Rattle and Grind,Rattle and grind noise on high makes this appliance unusable. I didn't mind the fan sound which was what I got for about 2 weeks. I have seen other users with similar complaints so it seems you have a 50-50 chance of getting something worth your money.
2,NOT WELL MADE,"After about a month of casual use the fan became very loud even on low, severely limiting the usefullness of the product.Not recommended."
5,Great for asthma and allergy sufferers,"I got this purifier to help with my sons asthma. He was coughing so much during the night and had to have allergy medicine to help control it. I wanted something that was small and inexpensive for his room. When the purifier arrived I set it up in his room by his bed. The manual says to run it 24 hours a day and to keep windows and doors shut for best results. Its been almost a week and I'm TOTALLY blown away! My sons hasn't had ANY allergy medicine and hasn't had ANY coughing spells! I never thought it would help this much. I close his door during the day and run the machine on low and then at night his door is open and the machine is run on high. It is a little noisy but we're used to sleeping with a fan or some kind of noise so it doesnt bother us. I think this purifier is a steal at the price I paid. I'm so happy with the way its helped my son, he now sleeps every night in peace....and so do I! I would definitely recommend this for a bedroom or small room."
5,A miracle!,We've only had this item for one day but already notice a HUGE difference. Both my husband and I had been waking up with stuffy noses ever since the cold season began and we started using our fireplace for heat. We placed a larger unit in our family room a week ago (also Honeywell) and noticed right away that there was less dust.But the real test was placing this smaller unit in our bedroom for the first time last night. The 'white noise' was great! And the best part was........no stuffy noses this morning! It was like a miracle!And no filter to replace!
2,worked great for only 3 weeks,"I bought this filter about six weeks ago. I have allergies and asthma, this filter allowed me to sleep threw the night and not wake up with an asthma attack. It was alittle loud but I like the white noise when im sleeping. When i used it in the living room i had to turn the tv up a bit. It also left a black ring on the table i usually had it on but it washed off pretty easilly. After abought 3 weeks of use it pretty much stoped filtering the air, and my asthma attackes returned. It also doesnt run as loudly anymore, or suck up as much air. I took it apart and cleaned it as recomended, and no change. So it worked great for 3 weeks but thats kinda a waste of money if it only lastes 3 weeks. So now i have to buy a new one this time i will spend more money and hopefully get a better product."
5,Just Right,"My boyfriend plays hockey and stores his gear in our spare room. This would not be a problem if the spare room didn't also double as a guest room. Who wants to smell sweaty hockey gear when they're trying to sleep? No one.This air purifier takes care of the smell without taking up a lot of space. The ""high"" mode is a little noisy, but if you like sleeping with white noise in the background (like I do) then it's not a problem. Or you can just put it on a lower setting. The ionizer does a good job of getting bad smells out of the air. The unit lets you know when it's time to clean the filter, so there's no need to guess. And since the filter is cleanable, you don't have to waste money on replacement filters.All in all, a great product for the price."
4,"Good for small, personal air purifier.","I have it running in my room, and it seems to clean the air well. It is a tad noisy, but I may relocate it away from the bed. It is NOT for large rooms, it is small. It can also be for someone who cannot afford the more expensive air purifiers. I give it an 8 out of 10."
4,Works for me!,"I read the reviews on line and was a little hesitant, but ordered it anyways. It's designated purpose is to clear a small basement room where smokers coverge. I must say, it doesn't immediately clear the smoke but when left on overnite after a crowd of 4 smokers, the room smells fresh in the morning. It is a bit loud-I don't think i'd want it running in my bedroom, but for my purposes it's terrific."
2,Too Noisy!!!!,"I was excited that this is small enough to place on top of the entertainment center in our living room and also that it has a permanent filter. Other reviews describe it as ""quiet"". Well, the one I have is VERY noisy!On the low speed, I have to turn the TV up to hear it over the sound of the air purifier. On ""med"" or ""high"" it is too noisy to focus on any other sound in the room! I don't even run it anymore (after a month) because it is just too noisy.I have another large air purifier as well as an ionizer in other rooms, both of which are much quieter than this machine!I took a chance on this machine as it had overall good reviews and a low price. I am VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!"
3,Good unit but MUCH too noisy!,Unit is the size of a laptop (width and length) and height of a grande Starbucks coffee. Right now my main compliant is noise.At the lowest speed settings the unit is highly audible and much too noisy for a quiet office.
5,Does its Job!,What can I say it cleans the air very well. Might have to get another one to put in bedroom instead of always switching from living room to bedroom. This product is small enough so that it can be placed anywhere u like and has two ways of standing.
4,The Solution For Hockey Equipment,"IN a nutshell I was tired of having to leave my hockey equipment in the garage, especially in the winter time. I decided I was going to keep it in the basement, that way it would dry faster and stay warm. However if you know hockey equipment, you understand why I was forced to keep it in the garage. I decided to give this a shot to see if it would ""clean"" the air... I am very happy with the result, I put this above my equipment on low and it works great to keep the odor down. I can say it was a bit noisy on high, but it is in my basement so no big deal."
3,"Good, but not Great","This unit seems to do its job, but I've had a few minor issues with it. First, the purifier is a bit loud, even on the lowest setting. Second, the left vent no longer pushes out any air. The right-hand vent pushes out air and only if I obstruct does air come out of the left side. I'm not sure if this is by design or some kind of fault (when I first started using the unit, I never checked whether or not air was coming out of both sides, probably because I presumed that both vents would be used). Third, it's difficult to clean the inner filter, though the outer one is fairly easy to dust."
2,Too noisey,This is the third air cleaner I've purchased. I found it much too noisey even on the lowest setting. Returned unit for refund. Can't speak of the efficiancy; didn't have it long enough.
2,loudest purifier ever,"Not sure if i got the defect product or what, this purifier is extremely loud and it whistles. The whistling noise becomes louder and stronger when it's set on the lowest level. I'm fine with the white noises (have 3 purifiers at home currently - the type that needs to replace the filters) but i just can't stand the sharp whistling. I tried for one night and it drove me nuts, so i had to return it. The return process with Amazon was wonderful. I didn't even have to take it to the UPS store. Amazon had UPS picked it up from my home. Love Amazon!"
3,Honeywell air purifier,"I bought this product upon recommendation of my daughter. I am happy with it, although is noisy on high power especially at nigt. The use of low power is more acceptable. The quality of aire improvement es good."
3,Honeywell HHT-011 Air Filter,"the one thing I do not like about Honeywell HHT-011 is it's loud and I have to turn up TV to hear. Other then that it does cut down on the smell of cigarettes, but only if you use the ionizer feature. I would not have purchased them (2) if I had known about noise. I previously had sharper image which were noise free, I only replaced them because they were old and worn out (they lasted 12 years!). Would have bought them, but the cost is very high."
4,"Not bad, not amazing.","About the size of three textbooks, this little guy does the job. It's light weight, easy to move from room to room. My little helper. My apartment is about 500 sq ft and it doesn't smell anymore. It is loud when set on high, but nothing compared to an air conditioning unit. On low, it's white noise and very manageable. I use low because my apartment is small and it's on most of the day. I'm okay with it being ""HEPA-like"" for the cost, if it was HEPA I wouldn't be able to afford it. I'm just waiting now to see how durable it is. It's not perfect, hence the 4 stars. But it does what I want and what I need at a pretty great price. I would recommend it to others who live in apartments, or for a large bedroom."
1,Not so much!,Looks cute. Loud. and my place needs cleaning... nothing in the filter after 2 weeks of running. Blah!
3,Gift for a cousin,My cousin says this air cleaner is working fine for her. She lives in an area where her neighbors use wood burning for heat and it affects her breathing. Got this for her for her bedroom. I gave it a its okay rating because I haven't personally used this product
2,air purifier,Works okay but a little large and not quite strong enough except for just one room. Still use it daily but have purchased a larger one for the house
2,What's the big deal!?,I just don't get what the hype is about. It's done absolutely nothing for us. I bought this for our bedroom while my Husband is going through chemotherapy and I don't feel that it's improved the air quality at all. Aside from the white noise I really have nothing good to say about it and while it's cheaper than a lot of others I wish I hadn't wasted the money.
3,It is ok.,"I thought this might help cut down on the amount of dust in our bedroom. I can't say that is has helped enough to justify the price. I've cleaned it several times and it does get really dirty after a few weeks of constant use.My husband loves it for the white noise it provides, and he will take with him when spending the night elsewhere. It has held up and has not broken, despite the travel it has endured.My expectations were possibly too high. In the future, I will look at other Honeywell air purifiers as well as other brands."
2,didn't feel the difference,use this guy for a week and didn't really feel the difference. so I returned it. You really don't know the long term effects of breathing ionize air and filter air.
2,Unit was loud and did not move enough air,"Purchased unit because I wanted a small filter for dust and pollen for my bedroom. In my previous house I had a much larger unit that was both quiet and effective, but got rid of it when downsizing to a small apartment. This unit was just too noisy, even on the lowest speed, for me to sleep. Returned through Amazon's excellent return policy."
5,Beats the stink of 4 guys. Well worth it.,"I bought this for my 4 person 19'x11' dorm. Things were getting a little smelly and the air was thick with dust. Within of day of using this at its highest setting, people on the floor started to notice the difference in smell. It's the perfect size; we placed it on top of a fridge and we forget it's there. I hardly ever have dust collect on my monitor any more. With the Super Saver Shipping it's worth every penny."
3,Honeywell HHT-011 Tabletop Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filter,I am a little disappointed since it doesn't cover enough space in my room and it's a little loud when you turn it on high. so i left it at medium. it's not too bad if you're not expecting too much from it.
3,Decent results for the money,"I have bought this purifier as a present for a relative with a new baby. It does seem to make the air cleaner and it eliminates smells pretty well.However, the sound of it, even on the lowest setting seems to scare the baby and therefore has to be turned off when the baby is in the room, which does not allow to run it for the recommended 24 hours.Also, the front grille doesn't quite snap in place, a defect in assembly I think for this particular unit; however it is not possible for me to exchange it as I brought it to another country.Overall, I think I got my money's worth out of it. It works well for small rooms with no small children present to be scared of the noise."
1,Don't Even Think About Buying it,This product spews black dust from the carbon filter EVERYWHERE. Creates more dust than it captures.
1,"Horrible, Smoked and smelled absolutely horrible","As soon as I plugged it in and switched it on, it started making horrible sounds, 20 seconds later it released smoke. This is a fire hazard, if I didn't stick around and be there to switch it off what would have happened? I do not suggest anyone purchases this product. After I bought I noticed that Amazon tagged it for review. They should just remove it totally."
2,"Bought for allergy, but not working","I have very bad allergy and was hoping that this air purifiercan save me. I put it on my desk and let it run all the time.Then I try to stay in my room as much as possible. Unfortunately,I am still getting very bad allergy. In fact, even worse thanlast season. The thing is totally not working. Anyways, if youare like me, looking something for your allergy, this is probablynot the one."
1,All parts would be nice!,"I couldn't even tell you how well my air purifier works. I recieved it without the filter and when I contacted Amazon, they sent me to the manufacturer and the manufacturer will not respond to my inquiry. That being said, I wasted over $40 for something I can't use and couldn't tell you whether it even works or not. I purchase from Amazon quite often, good customer lost."
2,Works better with HEPA filter removed.,"At first this purifier worked ok, but after a while it lost airflow. We have cleaned the HEPA filter good and it still has barely any airflow. We have since removed the HEPA filter and use paper towels instead, that way there is still airflow. I am now looking for another air purifier."
5,It actually works,"It's a bit noisy, but it actually works.It seems to deal with cigarette just fine."
4,What a difference!,"Makes a huge difference. We put it in a bathroom that has a litter box which had previously made the adjoining rooms dusty. SInce putting it in, it has made a DRAMATIC difference...and the adjoining room is 20x20! It is a bit noisy when it's on it's highest, so we leave it on the Medium setting when going to bed. Great product, especially for the price."
4,Good Product,It is a good product for small spaces. I like the feature of the three speed options. It is very quite and small.
1,Absolute Junk,"I purchased the product because it is from a reputable US brand- Honeywell; I have used another Honeywell air purfier and was happy with its performance. Not this baby. You might get 3 months out of it, as I did.The room (and house) are immaculate, so the unit was not pressed to its capacity. Far from it. It operated between 4 and 6 hours a day. It was turned off when I left for the day and turned on just before bed. I have a respiratory illness which requires the air , in the bedroom, be HEPA level ""clean""..After 95 days, it started to to emit a hum, without starting the fan. The unit was powered (as the nightlight went on). No fan-no air purifier.Spend your money on another product."
3,Good and bad...do you smoke...or not?,This unit does a pretty good job at filtering household contaminants so long as you are a non smoker. If you smoke the non replaceable Hepa filter gets trashed soon and the unit becomes worthless.If you smoke I do not recommend this unit nor do I recommend it for the clearing of smoke. However if your household is non smoking...the unit is just fine.The best filtration devices use replaceable filter media. Sometimes you have to pay the price for what you want.Consider a unit that has replaceable filters and check the cost of such filters and buy a unit that does not charge outrageous prices for the media. THats the trick.
2,Noise is louder than expected,"After reading the reviews I was psyched to have this awesome air purifier with a ""white noise"" kind of sound. But it's not, it more like your computer is overheating and you don't know what to do. It distracts me so much I turn it off for most of the day and I sleep with my sheets over my head. But I'm hoping I get used to it."
3,works fine but the bright green lights are obnoxious,"reasonably quiet,and works well, but isn't there a better way to let me know the system is on other than to have a garrishly bright green light to do it? I use it in the bedroom to keep the dog's dander under control but the lights I have to cover or keep part of the cleaning system off."
4,Good product,"I use this product every night and my allergy symptoms seem to have gotten better. It just makes the air around me feel cleaner. The white noise it makes also helps me fall asleep, so that's a nice little plus."
5,"Easy to maintain, compact, great white noise","I like to sleep with white noise, and the air purifier that I had required a new $20 filter every 3 months, so I was happy to get this model with a HEPA filter that needs to only be vacuumed. The outer filter is washable. This model has an ionizer (which I've read some bad stuff about) - but it can be shut off/has a separate control.Nice little air purifier -- perfect for a bedroom. The two lower settings are very quiet....but I like the high setting to drown out all those nighttime noises!!!"
3,Not Lifetime,"average Hepa Machine, with a ""Lifetime"" filter. Well I had to buya New lifetime filter from their website, my filter was dirty so I followedthe recommended way of cleaning it, the filter started to come apart on the corner.Then the whole bottom of the filter lost its bond. So I had to replace it."
3,Not a true HEPA filter,"The description on Amazon does not say that this is a HEPA-type filter. However, the manual states ""HEPA-type"" multiple times, so this is not a true HEPA filter. Unfortunate since I wanted a true HEPA filter and the product description is misleading.I've had this for one night thus far, and it works fine for now. Medium and high settings are too loud -- loud enough to take away from watching a movie in the same room. I've put it on low, and it's a quiet hum."
3,It helps,"It filters dust well when the mortor is running at the higest speed, but this also means much noise. Also, I had to tape the cover to the main body of the machine to silence a rattling sound. At the lowest speed, the machine is not that effective because not much air can go through it. The machine has an ionizer, but I don't think this works. (I own a different type of air purifier by another manufacturer, and I can smell the difference in the air when its ionizer is turned on.) Overall, the machine helps to capture some of the dust and fibrils generated from beddings and children's activities in my enclosed house in winter."
1,Bad Odor Emits from this brand new purifier,"HelloWe purchased the Honeywell HHT-011 Air Purifier a couple of days ago. Ran it for about 2 hours, then had to put it back in the box as the black pre-filter emits a horrible odor. Gave me a really severe headache and tonight when I had another look at it, same thing, and it was not even plugged in that time.I wondered if anyone else had this happen and if washing the filter will help?I will have to return it is the odor cannot be removed."
1,Cheap product,"Everything about this product is cheap, from the lightweight plastic it is made of to the form and fit of the parts. It was almost impossible to remove the front cover to install the filter to begin use. Called customer service and they could not help either. Finally yanked it off and installed it with the idea that if it comes apart the next time I will just throw it away.Filters the air in an 11 x 12 foot room okay but is almost as noisy as a leaf blower in doing so. I would not buy this product again and would not recommend it at any price over $10.00."
3,Just okay,I got this product because I have a rabbit and a dog and thought it would help with the pet smells.I thought the ionizer option would help with this but it really hasn't.Not that I have noticed anyway.It doesn't put out that fresh smell like some others. This product is a little noisy but not too bad. Although the product doesn't do what I hoped it would I have noticed that I don't wake up with a stuffy nose anymore. I still own the product and intend to keep using it.
3,It does what I need it to do,"This purifier seems to do it's job, which is a good thing since I have allergies but we have only had it a couple of wks. and it is already making a weird pretty loud noise, if it didn't do what it is supposed to do it would have already gone back to the store, but since it seems to still be working I guess we will keep it."
5,Awesome Air Purifier!,"I have two now, having been using them for about a year now, and have notice my allergies dwindle. Its a great, compact air purifier."
4,Noisy but good,"i was a little disappointed at the amount of noise this little guy makes. i usually like white noise when i sleep, but even on the lowest setting this thing wakes me up multiple times after my rem sleep (usually 4 or 5am). a noisy devil, but works well and you cant beat the price."
3,Air purifier stopped working suddenly,"I bought this air purifier in March 2011, it worked great! I purchased it a few weeks after I had my tonsils removed because my allergies were really starting to affect me and made my throat hurt. My doctor suggested getting an air purifier to help my allergies, and it did! It helped out a lot. I would clean the filters when it was time and really followed the instructions for it. But I noticed last week that it stopped working, it will not come on at all, not even the green light. I tried plugging it into another outlet, letting it rest for a few days, but nothing. I am very disappointed because I only had it for 7 months. Now its in the trash and I do plan on buying another one, but I hope that after another 6 or 7 months it doesnt do the same thing."
3,Does it work?,Used for months now and it will collect some dust. Ok for the price. Suggest for a very small room only. Wonder why the price went up?
2,Vibrates constantly unless placed on a towel,"It does work well, the room air seems cleaner and fresher but the unit is very loud, I was unable to get used to it in 2 weeks at the low setting due to a low thrumming and vibrating sound, at medium speed the vibration lessens quite a bit if the unit is placed upon a towel while it is on the dresser.It is definately NOT quiet at all, on loud settings I can actually hear it from downstairs with the bedroom closed and I doubt that anyone with decent hearing could sleep with that much noise.I usually put it on high when I am not home and then I put it on medium while I am sleeping.I quit using the ionizing feature as I feel it made the room smell odd.I would not purchase this again, I would purchase a higher quality more expensive one.Not sure if I can still return this after 3 months but if I can I certainly will as it is making more and more noises as time passes."
4,rock steady,"while not great for large rooms, but for a bedroom, it works really well. i use it weekly. and the fan is strong enough to work on a room about 100 square foot bedroom and clears it in a couple hours."
3,"Works well, but a little loud","The air purifier does what it was intended for, clean the air around the cat litter box. The only problem is that it is not quiet. The ""white noise"" created by the processing of the air is quite loud even on the low setting. If I had to be in the same room with it I would have returned it. But since it is in a seperate room it is ok, but I can still here it when I am passing by outside the room. It has helped with the smell of the litter box though so it is staying put."
4,pretty good air filter,"It's not nearly as loud as some people say it is, at least on the low setting. On the high setting it can get a little loud, but you don't really have to leave it on high all the time, so it's no big deal. Other than that, the big advantage of this air filter is that you don't have to buy an expensive new air filter all the time, so the price you pay is it, no more added on costs months down the road."
2,Noisy Air Purifier,"I purchased this from seeing the number of reviews over my old purchase of the Hamilton Beach 04383. Now that purifier was quiet. I don't even hear that it's on.Anyway, so I bought this one thinking this has to be better. I made sure I removed the plastic from the filter. First one I ordered was loud on the lowest setting, figured maybe it's a defect. Amazon with their WONDERFUL exchanges, sent me a new one. The second one was loud as well. Running it without the filter was quieter but putting the HEPA filter back on made the purifier a lot louder. I'm returning this and buying my old Hamilton Beach one for the other room. I didn't leave it on long enough to see how well it worked because the sound bothered me too much. With headphones on, I can hear this air purifier on the lowest setting. The headphones are open and NOT noise canceling. It sounds like it would do a pretty decent job cleaning the air which is why I gave it the 2 stars."
4,It works!,"I am awaking without clogged sinuses, at last! The grill does not fully attach the the device but it's on there and... it works."
3,Good for the price but not the best,"This purifier worked well in a small room for the first 6 months or so but gradually has become very noisy and doesn't seem to perform as well as it did in the beginning. The motor squeaks and squeals now after only 9 months of use and is especially loud on the high setting. Also, the air output smells dusty because the unit is full of dirt. I do frequently vaccuum the HEPA filter following the manufacturer's instructions, but I have no way of cleaning out the dirt that collects in the fan and motor.I was very pleased with this purifier for the first 6 months and it probably would have lasted much longer had I not used it 24 hours per day as the manufacturer suggests. Overall good value and will perform well in a small room. Plus no need to buy filters."
4,Excellent performance!,"I have a ferret and bought the unit to put in the room where the ferret is kept. Ferret's have a noticeable scent (to put it mildly). Now the room smells the freshest in the house.The unit is loud. I can hear it from another rooms. But for the price, I can live with it."
1,Does Not Work. Do not buy.,Item ran straight for 12 hrs. Followed all the instructions and then the item kicked off. After multiple tries item would not power back up. Returning for refund. Stay away from this product.
1,Defective Perhaps,"Purchased for bedroom, received yesterday and used last night. It is extremely noisy. I woke up stuffy and with a headache. I bought it based on the high reviews. Went back and reviewed the reviews - few mention noise. I think it is defective but am leery on getting replacement. When placed in vertical position the noise is worse - definite problem. I am returning it.Side note: I have 4 cats and recently keep them in separate room when sleeping and noticed big improvement in stuffiness, which returned today after using the above.Ordered another brand the same day for use in living room, which is much nicer in comparison; gentler noise w/whisper setting."
5,Great Product and want another one!!,This product is great and I am getting another one!!!! Sucks up a lot of dirty air in the house and you don't have to keep buying the inner parts to this because all you have to do is wash it!! Great Product!!! Thanks!!
2,This product is NOT QUIET!!!!,"HHt-011 is a bit noisy for any reviewers to call it ""quiet"" even on LOW setting. It's more like a stove fan on medium to me. I have bought Rabbit Air almost a year now and that one was super quiet on LOW and a terrific product. I wanted to buy another one but the price of 300 dollars blew away my budget. In any case, HHT-011 air purified capability should work fine, but I just think that reviewers who have called it ""quiet"" or ""could barely hear it"" could really mislead other future consumers."
1,Air purified,"Not as quiet as I would have hoped and whenever I turned on the device my computer monitors went fuzzy. I tried contacting the company, Honeywell, for support with no success. Do not buy."
1,Noisy,"I trusted the specs of this product. I bought it but did not have a chance to test it since it is SO NOISY that I decided to return it immediately. Its worse than an air conditioner wall set. Seriously, I wonder who can possibly sleep with this on."
5,Honeywell HHT-o11,Just what we needed. Love it. I researched this product befor buying. It lives up to my expectations. Thank You
4,Does what it's supposed to do!,After spending $50 on a air purifier the only thing to ask is wither it cleans the air $50 better. I think it does. It's basically a good sized vacuum cleaner that has a good filter on it. I put it on a rolling stand maybe 3 feet off the ground and put it in the middle of my 10x12 bed room. Usually set it to low setting with ioziner and i think it was worth the $50. My room always seemed pretty dusty (could see dust particles in sunlight) and maybe it got 60% less dusty in my observation. Oh and side note i ran it with a energy estimator and it says it would cost $50 in energy costs a year for california rates. Dunno what the estimator bases that on (hours per day) but i'm sure its a average best guess figure.
1,Fan developed a rattle after about a week.,"I purchased this unit because I like to have a fan running for noise while I sleep. I thought it would be better if the fan was cleaning the air instead of just being pushed around.Not long after we started using it, the fan began to rattle. When it was working properly, it gave out a good white noise. When the rattle starts in, it is very annoying.I have called for the warranty, and they want me to ship it back, and pay a $10.00 processing fee. Between the fee and the shipping cost, I will not be sending it back, nor buying another unit.I would avoid this unit."
2,unusually loud,"I have a whisper quiet Bionaire minitower filter that is no longer available so I was looking for a comparable unit for a second room. Ordered this after reading all the reviews. Just arrived today and it is unusually loud, even on the lowest fan setting. Not sure if this is a random bad unit or if this is typical (or perhaps my Bionaire is just exceptionally quiet). Returning this one today because the noise is just distracting"
4,sounds like a fan,"This is my 1st air purifier, I got it to hope it would help my allergies. It really hasn't done that, or not that much. It sounds like a fan the lower it is the quiet it is. Don't really understand the nightlight feature, I don't need it, but I guess it would be good for kids rooms. Small. I think the white/creamy nish has a slight pink tint to it, or maybe it's my lighting, but thats what I notice. Overall I have no complaints, I'm assuming it's doing what it's suppose to. Only have had it for a week. I keep it on pretty much 24/7"
2,Too loud for a bedroom unit...,"Even on the lowest setting, the fan in this unit is very loud. Too loud to fall asleep that's for sure."
4,Excellent permanent Hepa filter,Best price/quality ratio. A bit too noisy. I cannot leave this on at night. Small and compact. I also love the built in ionizer.
5,Magical!,"This air purifier is MAGICAL! It is small but clears up everything in my apartment.Some people say it is loud. I could see that, if you lived in a very quiet area (I live in the city), but it is only white noise and no louder than any of the noises your other appliances might make when running."
3,Smells,"I purchased this about a month ago, and have been leaving it running since. I am not entirely sure how much its cleaning the air because it lets out this horrible aroma - somewhere between a new car and burnt rubber. It hasn't stopped smelling yet.Otherwise, the product arrived clean and working great."
4,Decent Air Purifier,"The moment I received the purifier I immediately set it up & placed it in my bedroom. This has really helped reduce the stuffiness & congestion I would normally wake up with every morning. I can tell a difference, but it is MOST effective in a smaller confined space. You just have to figure out where you need the purifier-if it's more than one room & a large space it only makes sense to purchase a purifier that covers a larger area.I've had the purifier on constantly for about a month. It works great for the space I use it in.**Update**it's been about 6 1/2 months since i purchased this item.It's been on all day, every day.it still works the same as it did the first day i got it."
2,LOUD,"I've had this for over a month. I put one in my daughters' bedroom and one in their toy room. The toy room one broke within 3 days. A piece of the fan flew off. The one in their bedroom is so loud that they constantly complain. Worse is that I do not feel it's effective, even in their small bedroom. I have other purifiers in the house and this one doesn't compare. I wouldn't buy it again. I'm actually looking to replace it."
2,Gets louder the longer it's on,"I was happy with it the first time we used it. Low speed was very quiet, for the first few days. Compact size that fit on a shelf. However, before too long it got llouder. It starts whisper quiet, but after a few hours it's too loud and we had to turn up the tv. High setting is like a loud hair dryer, by the way. I'm feeling too lazy to return it because of its cheap price, but we have to turn it on when we pollute the air, then in a little while, turn it off again. Rats. It works pretty quickly to clean the air even in a big room."
3,Purifier,"It is a very compact Purifier and it works well, but is it ever noisy, even on the lowest setting - and I am hard to hearing in both ears, so that should give you an idea how noisy it is..."
4,Pretty good,I don't really feel the effect or difference this filter makes. The only time I really felt it was in the living room when it sucked away all the odor. I have a cathedral ceiling apartment. So this poor small thing might not get enough time to clean out all the air inside my bedroom when run in setting II. Its not that noisy as some of the reviews suggest. I am satisfied with it.
3,Not Very Quiet At All!,"I bought this to help alleviate some of the allergens and dust particles that float around my bedroom. Really good concept and good price, not to mention that I love having a permanent filter. However, I found it to be quite noisy. Maybe it's because I'm only 26 and can hear high pitch noises, but I found this machine to emit some really high annoying frequency. I would actually run my other fan along with this one to get rid of that noise. Great device, but I had to return it since the noise was driving me crazy."
5,Love it,"I bought this unit based upon others reviews. I love the fact that you don't have to replace the filters and it does just what it says. We have ours in the bedroom and have been using it every day since we received it. I bought one for my sister for Christmas for her apt. Good price, and great purifier."
4,Works fine in an awful environment,"I'm currently based in Iraq where the air is dirty & foul. Though this is definitely not industrial strength, it does a decent job & is reasonable quiet."
3,3 Stars reason why.,"As everyone had stated already. I give this item 4 stars, just because it is pretty loud (even on low). 4 stars because it actually works and I can breathe again. I wake up more energized and no more dry throats (I'm assuming i collect a lot of dust in my system when i sleep). Great product, a little noisy.*UPDATE*8 months later after turning this on 24/7 on high, the motor finally died out. Oh how I wish I still had that warranty. After moving to a new location, I couldn't find it.4 stars for working when it did. -2 star for short life span."
2,anyone else filter clog unable to clean?,"i can't imaging this is just me, but after about 3-4 months, the permanent filter turned grey and i was unable to clean it to a state where the filter didn't cavitate. the little light that's supposed to go on due to excess pressure never did(even if i block off the filter passage completely), however the unit was sucking so hard that it pulled in through one of the top vents while it blew out the other... blew fine when the filter was out. also, i could tell it was no longer sucking through the filter as the black prefilter no longer collected dust. i even used my high horespower shop vac to no avail. later i purchased one of the older non permanent hepas sold for the earlier model to see how it would do. it was the same, got me about 2 months. is there some magic way to clean these i don't know about? if not, id' consider this thing useless. btw, this is only cleaning a small 12x15 room."
2,"Good, but LOUD","PROS:-Easy to maintain.-No filter replacement needed.-Compact size.CONS:-VERY LOUD.-Nightlight is a joke (very small)Basically, if you use this consistently and constantly (like I do), you will find that on LOW it sounds about like a fan. If you are looking for something quiet, this is NOT the right choice. Besides that it's ok."
4,"Good value, effective","I marked this as an item in my wish list after a friend recommended it. I bought it when I was waking up every morning with a running nose or sneezing.This purifier is indeed noisy, as some other reviews warned me about. On its lowest setting, it's still effective and not too bad, though. After a day of running on low, I can sleep well into the next morning without any sneezing. Its benefit is quite noticeable. I rarely run it on medium or high, as it's both noisy and unnecessary."
4,Good Purifier for Its Size,"It's a fairly small purifier that works effectively in small rooms. If set to the highest level, it's loud for about an hour or so then it settles down (or maybe I'm used to the noise). Otherwise, it's great and I'd buy another one for my cubicle at work."
2,Terrible Durability,"After two weeks worth of use, the motor start making grinding noises so I had to return it. Worked pretty well up until then though."
5,works nicely,"This little guy works nicely and filter the air as advertised. I can feel the freshness in the air when I turn it on (especially with ionizer). For the competitive price, I do recommend this product as an investment for your health."
2,Loud,"So I bought this air filter for our son's room after we had purchased the hamilton beach one for our daughter's room. I just thought that both were so similar that I'd like to see how this one compared. We were immediately disappointed. The quiet setting was rather loud and at a pitch that was irritating to our ears. The only option is for this to sit flat, not stand up, so that was a minor disappointment also...it's nice to be able to stand the air filter up. The ionizer made it smell funny...needless to say, we packed it up immediately, shipped it back and got another hamilton beach one."
2,Cheap for a reason,"This air purifier works decently well for a little while. I bought it because one doesn't need to buy additional filters. It says you can clean the one it comes with. You can. But when you try to put it back in, the machine does not work.This thing is cheap for a reason. I would definitely recommend buying one that is slightly more expensive. I am out fifty bucks and will most likely toss this piece of cr*p shortly.I highly recommend passing."
4,Honeywell HHT-001,Using in small bedroom and it seems to work very well. No coughing or allergic reactions noted when this product is being used. The little night light is perfect.
2,doesn't do much good,"I ordered this because having to buy filters was way too expensive. I thought I'd made a good choice at first, but now I can't tell that it is doing any good, even after cleaning."
2,"Not bad, but very loud","We keep this in our kitchen, it does seem to clear out any smell within 2-3 hours. Only problem is the loud noise which started (surprise !!) after the amazon return window was closed - I would have returned it otherwise."
3,Definitely NOT Quiet,"The reviews saying that this purifier is quiet are definitely misleading. Even on the lowest setting, it is fairly loud(I was able to hear it from another room, with the AC going). It sounds like being on a plane, so if you don't mind that type of white noise, then this is an ok product. I use it at work where I am surrounded by computers, so the noise blends in. I only had it for a few days, so I have not yet felt a significant change in the air quality."
2,Doesn't work for smoke,"I got this specifically to help with cigarette smoke. It simply does nothing to assist with it. If i smoke a few cigs in my room, even a day later, the smell still lingers. Other than that it might work fine, but that is the only reason I got it."
3,Not so noisy,"I bought this even though I was concerned about the noise it might make. One reviewer was right, it is not whisper quiet. It makes a light enough noise to be considered white noise. As for how well it works, I will have to give it some time. I won't be able to tell how much better the air quality is until I get through the bad cold that hit just before receiving it."
2,Worked great but broke after a few months - Fire risk?,"I bought this for my son's room as he has airborne allergies. The product worked great and the noise was gentle enough for a baby to sleep (if you like background noise such as white noise) My son's runny nose went away quickly but after just a few months, the motor quit working. YEsterday the machine started making weird noises. This concerned me as an electronic fire risk in my child's room! I unplugged it, waited a few moments, them plugged it back in and the machine completely stopped working.While I think this machine used to be great, the fact that it stopped working within a few months is a big let down. The fact that the motor made weird noises at the end can easily make a new mom think that it could have over heated or malfunctioned and started a fire in my son's room."
2,They call it an Air Purifier,"I can usually find something good about a product that I am about to give a bad review on-but not this time.It's loud and I haven't noticed any difference in the air.For my purpose, getting rid of cigarette smoke odors, it doesn't work at all. I'm not giving it the lowest star because it may work for other types of odors.I'm completely unimpressed.I threw the packaging out, so it is staying. I'm back on the lookout for one that works."
2,Fan and not a purifier,"I bought it months ago but never felt it is purifying the air nor get rid of hte bad smell ,I am using it as a fan and you can't switch it on on winter otherwise you will be chilled.I don't recommend anyone to buy it unless you need a fan."
3,Good value for the money,"Within 24 hours the unit was able to turn the air in my basement apartment (approx 700 sq ft). Smell from the ionizer is noticeable, which is good b/c otherwise would not know if it were even on.I haven't read the manual yet, but I assume there's a way to clean the ionizing plates. Access to the filter is simple, but the plates not so much...Overall, good value for being one of the least expensive HEPA Purifier on Amazon."
3,not convinced,"I have had this unit running continuously in my son's room since I received it. It seems to be well made, and quiet enough, but I really don't notice any difference in my son's allergy symptoms."
3,it is too noisy,"I just got it yesterday, so i am not sure about how good the machine works for the air.But it is too noisy, cannot sleep when it is in my bedroom."
3,Fan is too noisy,I agree with the other reviews. It does help with dust allergies.The fan is too noisy and I have it on the lowest setting. I will look at other units. This may be the best for the price I paid.
3,"It does it job, but it's loud.","I bought the Honeywell HHT-011 to help purify the air of a tiny room. For the past few months, it's done a good job of it. I don't have to dust as much and my allergies have abated. Unfortunately, it's a bit noisy, even on the lowest setting, and it sometimes has an annoying squeak."
4,air purifier,We have three long hair cats and had an allergy issue in the house especially with my kids. I picked up 4 of these purifiers at a relatively inexpensive cost and spread them through out the house. The improvement in air quality has been impressive. My daughter when home from college would start sniffling within a couple days of a return home but recently was home for 3 weeks with very little issue. The only draw back is they are a little loud with the blowing of air.
5,AIR CLEANER,This is the third one I have bought because of the washable prefilter. The other ones I've had are expensive to maintain. This is great for a bedroom.
4,It works fine for me,"I purchased this item about a month ago to help with a dusty old house with cats. Since using the Honeywell Air Purifier I have noticed a difference with the air and amount of dust in the room. The musty smell that I once had is no longer there and the amount of dust that accumulated in the room has been cut signifigantly.A lot of folks have mentioned the amount of noise this product makes. When the speed is set to low I do hear it but it sounds like a fan. The higher you set the speed the louder the noise. The highest speed I do notice and its hard to ignore. I'm not saying it sounds like a freight train, just that I do notice it. I leave my setting on low and it works fine cleaning the air.I plan on purchasing another for my bedroom."
5,Great Product,I was having 2 to 3 asthma attacks a day. I live in the country and the wood smoke from nearby houses was causing me serious problems. I have had no asthma attacks since I started using this product at night. I put it on its lowest setting and it is very quiet. Better than the steroid inhaler my doctor had me on.
2,noise vs filtration update,"Compact size is fine, just right in proximity to my work station BUT motor noise is totally unacceptable, an annoyance! I have a larger floor model Honeywell and that is much quieter than this model. I regret not returning this unit within the period allowable. If you receive one with this ""problem"", do return it immediately, the noise doesn't subsist.Update:Just received a replacement, Amazon is the greatest. Plugged in, on low, nose is ""normal"", no motor rattles. I will update this when unit has been running for few hours or so. I like unit's size and footprint. My larger unit, on continuously in bedroom is just fine.Update:Perhaps it's luck of the draw with these units, replacement received from Amazon, running continuously for three days and no motor rattle."
5,Love this product!!!,"Live in an apartment with many other residents. Smell all kinds of oders. Once I pluged in two units and ran them for a few hours, nothing but clean air. Have only tunred machines off to clean filters."
4,"Effective, though louder than I thought","I have a pipe room where..well, you can imagine what I do there. This device more than effectively removes the smell and smoke from the room to a degree that's almost astounding: you can be one room over and not know that I'm enjoying a pipe.I'm trying it in different locations about the room in order to ""tone down"" how loud it is. I don't wish to overstate, its not that its obnoxious, its just not quiet. I would describe the volume as about that of a room fan on ""medium.""For the price? Great. I'm very happy."
4,Works great!,"Originally bought this to keep air clean where cat has kitty litter, but found out that the sound of it freaked the cat out too much. Moved into our bedroom and used at night. Love it! Have slept much better and it drowns out other noises in the house at night."
5,Compact Air Purifier,even though the product was larger than i had anticipated; it does fit on a small side table and looks ver nice in myspace...the operational noise is minimum and the controls are easy to read..i like this !!!!
4,Good air cleaner,Pretty good in filtering dirt and improving air quality. Just somewhat noisy when going full blast.
1,Cannot recommend,After four months of part time use it quit. Very unhappy about this. I personally woulod not recommend this brand to anyone.
1,LOUD!!!,"I am going to return this, the description said it was very quiet and it isn't. It also seems to make the room very cool. If you're not planning on running it overnight while you are sleeping, I suppose it's a good deal, but for now we are running it with our bedroom door closed and have to turn it off before we try to go to sleep."
2,Permanent filter clogs and is unreplaceable,"the permanent filter clogs, and I was not able to clean as directed with a vacuum cleaner- when doing so the pleats became flattened and continued to be noticeably filled with dirt. And after doing this the air output was not increased at all. Also the permanent filters are not replaceable so I am back trying to buy a whole new product"
1,Not very good,"I purchased this unit in December for use in a very small office. Only two months and the fan has started squealing and makes an unbearable noise. I no longer have the box it came in, nor the packing slip that is required to return. There is no reimbursement for return shipping and not sure about the exchange. It will probably cost $12-$20 to return plus my time, so it is not worth the hassle, as they probably assumed for most people."
2,Arrived Broken,"This arrived with the fan hitting the housing and was unusable. Long story short, sent it back and got a replacement.That said, the replacement is working fine and has run for about three weeks without issue. Does a very good job of cleaning the air in our bedroom and made a noticeable difference for my wife’s’ allergies. Runs relatively quiet and I’m enjoying the white noise when on low. Seems a bit flimsy in construction with thin plastic, I guess we’ll see how long it lasts. An ‘okay’ air purifier if you get one that actually works, but if this one needs replacement I’ll be trying a different manufacturer.If it were not for the poor quality control I would have given this 4 stars."
1,Malfunctioned After 8 Months,"Air Cleaner started making a loud continuing rattling noise after about 8 months of use (10 hours per day). Called Honeywell customer service. Warranty requires customer to pay shipping to Memphis, TN and additional $10 check for shipping of replacement cleaner. Terrible customer service. I will put this unit in the trash. I DO NOT recommend this product."
5,WOW-ZA,"i bought this bc there was mold growing in my windows and i kept on sneezing.don't worry, i no longer live there lol.but this thing works! and it's easy to clean, pretty quiet (i think), and it comes with a little night light."
3,Worked well for exactly a year before it quit.,"The purifier worked really well for almost exactly one year. I ordered September 1, 2010 and it stopped working on September 3, 2011. The size was good for my dusty 11'x10' room in AZ, but it could struggle in anything larger. The prefilter worked great and both filters were easily cleaned with a vacuum. It is quite loud on high, but I found it to be kind of comforting at night to drown out any background noise while I slept. I got approximately 650 hours of life out of the machine, but I am dissatisfied that the motor quit so quickly. Depending on how heavily you use it, this could be a good product for you at a reasonable price."
4,"good filter, but not quiet.","the machine fulfills on all it's promises except for one: quiet. The purifier has 3 settings, the one with the greatest air flow produces a 60 decibel sound--about the same as a conversation-- the middle setting produces a 55 decibel sound, and the lowest setting a 50 decibel sound. Since 50 DB is normal for a fan, and a fan is used to move the air through the filter in the first place, had it not said it was quiet in the description i wouldn't have a problem with this, but it was advertised as quiet, and was nothing special in this regard."
3,Honeywell does well...,"I was excited to get this filter as a gift and I will need to run it a full week until I can say I'm satisfied...I can tell the difference with air quality but it can be quite loud actually so I can't run it 24 hrs in my room, it keeps me up on low! I might have to move it elsewhere so the sound doesn't bother me!"
2,Does it even do anything?,"I am in serious disbelief as to whether or not this product even works. I ordered this thing 8 months ago, and the filter is in perfect condition. Yes, I removed the plastic thing protecting it and it's blowing air just fine. It just doesn't collect anything. My air conditioner filter, on the other hand, does collect a little bit. This product still looks brand new, the filter is exactly the same as it was 8 months ago. Not worth the money, imho, as it really doesn't seem to be working at all. I had such high hopes too."
3,Compact Air Purifier,"This air purifier is very noisy even on low speed. I have it in my office, and it is not white noise it sounds like a motor with a pulse in it. I would not recommend this one, there has to be something better."
3,Very Loud,"I have bought Honeywell air purifiers before with the permanent HEPA filter feature, and have had no problems. This one works well as far as I can tell, but it has a very loud fan that can be irritating even on the lowest setting. Other than that: so far, so good."
2,Too Loud,"It might get the job done, but is loud doing so. Even on low settings, it's more than ambient noise, it's a bother.I returned the same day i got it."
3,Louder than had hoped!,It seems to be helping with my cat dander allergies but it is definitely louder than I had hoped. We sleep fine with the low setting but it's still a lot louder than I prefer. The medium and high settings are extremely loud and I would not use those settings while in the room. I will probably be looking for a new quieter purifier and will put this one in the office.
4,Just don't know,"I have had the unit for about one month and I really don't know if it does anything. The washable filter does accumulate some dirt but the HEPA filter does not appear to be dirty at all. So, psychologically I guess it works, but actually, I don't know and could not rave about it.Operationally, the unit has two switches, which it says are illuminated, but they aren't. When you put on the ionizer a light comes on that is too bright for nighttime so we turn it off in the evenings. The night lite is the same type of light so there is no need to turn it on. The unit does have a powerful fan and in high speed is quite obvious. In low speed we have no trouble sleeping at night."
4,Compact Air Cleaner,This small air cleaner is best for very small areas. It sits atop my cat's litter box located in the bathroom and does an adequate job of controlling litter box odors between changes. It can also be mounted on a wall if you don't have a place for it to sit. Replacement filters are relatively expensive at $42.00. It's fairly quiet on low and has strong airflow. I think it's a too noisy and too small for the average bedroom. Permanent filter doesn't really mean permanent however. Permanent filters do become clogged over time and simply must be replaced. It's a decent little unit for very small areas.......recommended!!!!
4,GREAT LITTLE FILTER,"THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE FILTER FOR A SMALL ROOM. ITS QUIET,WITH 3 FAN SPEEDS, COMPACT, SITS FLAT OR UPRIGHT, AND HAS A PERMANENT FILTER WHICH IS EASY TO CLEAN. AND AT THIS PRICE IS A REAL BARGAIN. I WILL BUY THIS AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ROOM."
3,Nice Little Purifier,"I don't think the sound is overwhelming at all. It sounds like a fan. I like that it's small -- the perfect size if you want to put a purifier in several different rooms rather than relying on one big machine to take care of the whole house. I haven't noticed a difference in air quality, though. I got it to try and cut down on the amount of dust in my apartment. It doesn't seem to be doing that. I raised it off of the floor last week and I'm hoping that helps. I'll update my review if anything changes. I'm not giving up on it yet!"
2,This unit is LOUD,"I've had a Honeywell tower purifier for years and wanted a desktop model for my office. The price on this one was right, but in the end the joke's on me. It has three speed settings and an on/off for the ionic cleaning. The lowest speed is nearly as loud as my Holmes tower's highest speed. You can hear it on Low from the other side of the house. Other than the noise, it seems to be working fine. The only problem is that I don't often run it on Med or High due to the noise, so it's probably not as effective as it could be."
3,Skeptical,"The first unit had a malfunctioning ""clean filter light"" that continuously blinked on and off. After a week of conversations with the maker (Honeywell/Kaz), I decided to send the unit back. Thankfully, I bought this item from Amazon which took back the defective unit and sent me a brand new one instantly. So far, so good. However, I do still have doubts as to if this unit really helps purify the air."
3,too noisy,"I've had this for about a month and can't know how well it actually does its job, yet, but it's much louder than the Sunbeam that it replaced. I had the Sunbeam in the kitchen and a Holmes in the bedroom and both of those were much quieter than this Honeywell. You probably wouldn't want this in the room where you sleep unless you need to drown out some other noise. And just to be clear, I keep it on the low setting. The noise is sort of like a hair dryer on low.I'll try to update this review when I can see if the thing works. With my other air purifiers, the dust removed from the air could easily be seen on the filter and the initial foam piece that picks up the bigger particles. These would get filthy pretty quickly. I bought this Honeywell, this time, because the filter doesn't need to be replaced. I hope it still does its job."
1,Was way to loud,We were looking for a air purifier. We found this one And because it was supposed to be quiet we bought it. When we plugged it in it was loud. There was no way we could sleep with it on. We ended up returning it.
2,not that great...,"this machine is LOUD! i thought that i'd be able to live with the noisiness, however, it is just too annoying to get past. i fell like it just spreads the dust around the room instead of collecting it. i'm going to give it away, not a good product at all."
4,Tim,It works great. It is small and quiet and doesn't need replacement filters. I recommend it for anyone with allergies to get rid of the dust in the house.
3,Not bad,"This filter does seem to do an admirable job, we put it in our bedroom.Unfortunately it does make a little bit too much noise for us to run it while we sleep.Still, if we run it during the day and turn it off to sleep it does seem to help."
4,Good product,"Honeywell HHT-011 iss excellent for a small bedroom. I find my need for allergy pills has gone down since my purchase and installation. On the low setting the the sound is acceptable and does not in anyway disturb my sleep. I recommend this product, it arrived on time and has performed well since the day I installed it and is certainly worth the price."
2,Think twice,"Pros:-It's easy to assemble-Not too large-Operation is very simpleCons--Very loud product. I keep it in my room, and only turn it on when I am leaving the apartment.-At first the vents in the top spewed out air that smelled very strongly of plastic. It's not as bad as time passes.-There are rubber pads about the size of a middle finger glued on the back to help if it gets dropped or knocked around. One keeps coming off. I will have to super glue it.I am not sure if this item is actually doing anything beneficial for me. I wanted to get something like this because there is a smoker in the family, and the carpeting in my room is old and gives off a bit of a musty odor. I haven't noticed any fresher air, or less dust, just another gadget sitting around."
2,Noisey and smells,I have chosen to return it since it is very noisey and has a bad plastic smell to it. It did appear to work somewhat since there was already some dust trapped in the Hepa filter but the noise was unbearable even on the lowest fan setting as was the funky plastic smell. My old Holmes 2400 are much quieter than this machine.
3,A little too nosy for me,I run this during the day because it is too loud for me to run at night in my bedroom. It's ok so I guess I will keep.It.
1,Broke Down Fast,My product completely quit running in about a month. Very poor product. I would never buy one of these type purifiers again.
2,Too noisy to be usable in bedroom or a quiet office.,"I really wanted to like this unit. The allure of never having to purchase filters was too much to resist. On the lowest setting, the unit is noisier than any other small air filter I've ever purchased. Especially distracting while talking on the phone in my home office. As far is using in the bedroom... not an option for me. This unit also emits a mild but noticeable plastic smell while directly in front of it. I only ran the unit for two hours so the smell may dissipate over time. One other possible issue for some... this unit claimed 99% efficiency. It was my understanding that true HEPA filters operate at 99.99%. I must confess that I tend to be keenly aware of background noise and odors although I've owned a number of air filters over the years and this is the first one I've returned. All that said, you may not be as concerned as I was."
1,This isn't the model I received,"I ordered this model, the HHT-011, because it had a permanent filter. I received the HHT-016-MP, which isn't a HEPA and has two replaceable filters, and I realized the mistake wasn't mine after the time to return it had lapsed. I had a non-HEPA air purifier that I wanted to replace because I the filters were discontinued, and I didn't want to fall into that trap again, but here I am.Note to all: when you get this, don't rip it open and plug it in. It might not be what you ordered."
2,poor quality,"It is a lowest quality product there is: noisy and getting noisier every day, it starts vibrating more and more, plastic parts are falling off, smells plastic staff and so on. In addition, the sale store Toyzz would NOT take it back!"
2,This wasn't worth any money.,I keep using this item. The filter hasn't need changed yet. The outside white area is getting messy from us smoking and the dust we have problems with. But the filter hasnt even gotten dirty yet at all. This machine is no where near worth $1. Think will have to start doing checks on others to get advice on things before making purchases.
1,Piece of Junk,"I would advise not purchasing this product. I believe the motor in the unit is of poor quality. Tilt it in any direction and it noticably wavers. This is not the sign of a long lasting motor. Additionally, the unit is too loud to sleep to, especially in a 10'x8' room. It generates a choppy fan noise about three times a normal air conditioner.I can't comment on its air cleaning capabilities because I am returning it."
4,It is a little loud but does move air well,I like this unit because of its small size and (I'm hoping) permanent filter. The unit IS a little loud on the highest setting but it's not all that bad. I'd buy another one...
3,Too Loud for Office,"Unit seems to work fair as far as the removal of airborne particles but is very loud, even on low. Seems when you first turn it on it is fairly quiet but after an hour or so it becomes loud. Like a roaring hum. Great for white noise in bedroom but I have in my office and sometimes I have to turn off just to get some quiet time. Actually interferes with my hearing when spoken to from door of office. Think I will have to try another brand for work."
5,So far - so good.,It seems to be doing the job. The bedroom feels cool and refreshing and dust free so far. The real question is how long the permanent HEPA filter will hold up. Time will tell. So far-so good.
4,Not bad.,"Not a bad value, is kind of loud, like a fan set to high. Easy to clean filter. Also, it has a very bright green light, so don't try sneaking this into a kids room."
1,NEGATIVE STARS!!!,"I don't know how some people say that it produces ""white noise."" The thing sounds like an airplane warming up its engines even on LOW setting. I really want to like this product but I can't ignore its presence in the room. It's all I can think about! Is my product defective? I'll post a video review later when I get over the flu.. I wonder if I'll be able to sleep through the sound even with all the NyQuil.. The only thing I like about it so far is that it ejects cool air instead of hot air. At least it isn't heating up the room.Update:It's now broken and just sitting atop my shelf. Don't buy this. It's junk as far as I can tell. I used it lightly and only few times a week really due to all the noise even on low setting."
2,Noisey unit for a bedroom!,"I read the reviews and really thought I picked a small air purifer that was quite. I own a SANYO air washer and I hardley ever hear it, but I needed a smaller unit. The Honeywell is too loud for my taste and does a fair job purifing the air."
4,Works well,Have had for about a month now. A little noisier than expected even in low setting. Humming noise probably due to the console I have placed it in.
3,"Awesome, for a few months.","It worked perfectly and very quietly for months, but then one day it just started making a terribly loud noise, and it never went away. I even opened it up and cleaned it/greased it. There's nothing I can do to fix it. I would love to buy another one but I'm afraid I'll end up regretting it in a few months like I did this one. Hopefully it was just a dud, if so then I recommend this."
2,noisy and bright,"I found this unit to be very noisy compared to another brand that I have. But even more annoying was the light - there was a nightlight, but even with that off the thing lights up the room at night. Not acceptable for a bedroom! Did do the job, at least, so I gave it a couple stars. Amazon did refund the price - impressive!"
1,"Noisy, seems to do nothing.",This unit is noisy and kept me awake at night. It also seems to do nothing to collect any dirt particles. Wish I didn't buy it. I also wish I had thought to return it within the 30 days. Shame on me. It's a yard sale item now.
5,Prefect for a small space,"We live in an apartment and our neighbor is a heavy smoker. After covering all the light fixtures, outlets, base boards etc... The smell of smoke continued to creep into our bedroom so I bought this air purifier in hopes of eliminating the smell. we have been using it for two weeks and I haven't smelled any smoke since. It is not too big and runs about as loud as a regular fan. So far I'm veery happy with the purchase."
2,Motor died after 6 months,"I used this filter for 6 months almost continuously and it worked great but then the motor died. For something that needs to run constantly to be effective, I wasn't expecting it to fail after such a short time. Giving 2 stars since it was relatively inexpensive and worked well when it did run - it cleared up all of my winter allergies. Was hoping I could use it for several years though."
2,"Loud, ineffective","Do not waste your money on this. I wish I had paid more heed to the reviews that noted how loud this purifier is. It is not quiet - aside from being loud on its own, after the third day of use it started to rattle as if the parts inside had come undone and were clanking around. I followed all of the included instructions and thus far haven't experienced an improved quality in the air of the bedroom where I've set up the machine. (I've had the purifier for two weeks). It's basically an incredibly loud, irritating, paper weight at this point."
1,Bought two - both stopped working within 8 months,"I would love to write a 5 star review as the product worked well while it worked. However, I purchased two (at two different times) and both stopped working after 6-8 months. To make matters worse, you have to pay Honeywell a fee to get a replacement. I paid the first fee - not sure what I am going to do with the 2nd unit (just broke this week - it was purchased in October).One breakdown could be a fluke - two breakdowns tells me to look elsewhere next time. I would not recommend."
1,completely stopped working,"We used this in our small bedroom, on the floor, for about two months before it started making weird noises and then eventually stopped working. We cleaned it, though it didn't need a cleaning and that did nothing. Two months! And I can't return it, and I don't want to send it to a landfill. And the air in San Francisco is the WORST. So if you'd like a free broken air purifier, let me know."
3,Noisy,I just bought it and it seems to be picking up some dust by the prefilter. However even on low this is loud. Sound like an AC even on low. I you like noise then it is fine but way too loud for me. I took the HEPA filter out as that lowered the noise but I am not keeping this. Giving to someone else who doesn't mind noise.
4,Air purifier,I use it to clear smoke from my cigars in a closed room. It works quite well without noise.
2,Noisy,This air purifier is loud. I have to turn the volume up on my TV close to 70 (the loudest being 100) just so I could hear over the air purifier.
5,good value for a hepa cleaner with permanent filter,"Some people have commented about the sound. It sounds like a common air conditioner (but without the compressor noise). Part of making things compact is the fans get smaller and have to spin faster to do the same work. I'm using it mostly when the room is unoccupied, so it's not a concern at all.It's doing a fine job keeping the air clean. I may get another one or two sometime.I have allergies so I like to keep the air clean to prevent symptoms. I also use the air cleaner in my darkroom to remove dust that might otherwise end up on film and in photos."
4,Works well,"I got two of these, one for the kitchen and one for the living room. Hubby smokes and it helps a lot. The units are a little louder than I'd like even on the lower settings but they seem to do the job they were purchased for so that makes me happy."
2,Not a HEPA Filter -- BIg difference -- Beware,"If you have bad allergies and need a HEPA filter, beware of phrases such as ""HEPA-like"" and ""90% HEPA"". They are NOT nearly as good as the real thing.By its own description, this filter lets through over TWENTY TIMES as much as a real HEPA filter, and if you have bad allergies the difference is massive. HEPA is a specification that must be met before you can use the term. Specifically, it must block ""at least 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 micrometers (m) in diameter"". This filter, on the other hand, removes ""up to 99%"" of particles.Shame on Honeywell for slapping ""HEPA"" on all their filters even when it doesn't apply."
1,Disappointment,"I ordered 2 pcs of this item and was disappointed to receive 2 faulty ones that can't be operated. When switched on, smoke and the smell of burnt plastic/rubber emits from the machines. It was frightening as you won't know if it'll explode or burst into flames. Both had the same problem.I wanted to send back for a refund but the shipping rate is more expensive than the price of these 2 items combined.This is frustrating and I vow never ever buy from Amazon again!"
1,Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filter,Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA FilterUSELESS!! did not remove my smoke smell even though I had it right in front of me.
3,"Not too bad, a little noisy though",This air purifier does an ok job of sucking the dust out of the air. My main issue with it is the noise. Anything over slow speed I only use when I am not in the room because it is pretty loud. My Ionic Breeze makes the room smell better and you can't even hear it.
1,After a few days doesn't work,We bought the product to reduce allergies. It seem to work well the first days but later on started to accumulate dust. It doesn't matter how much was cleaned. Not recommended.
2,You have to break it to remove the front panel,"The tabs on the sides are not true latches. They are so cheaply, inadequately and badly designed that it's impossible to remove the front grill part to clean the filter without just yanking it off and breaking the tabs. Now for us the front sits loosely in front of our air purifier; it's not attached. If nobody else is mentioning this it must be because they haven't had to clean the filter yet. The sound of the purifier is pretty loud, I agree. It also turned ""rattly"" sounding after about a year. It's okay for us because we use it in the BR's while sleeping and it serves as white noise but for those who want a quietly running machine all day I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,LOUD!!!,"This is way to loud for a 80ft room. My bedroom's TV's volume is normally around 25, with this unit on I have to have it up to 40 just to year dialog. I honestly hope this thing breaks in someway so I can send it back for a refund.As a filter, it works."
3,"It does the job, but it sadly becomes Obsolete in a short time.","It was a great little purifier, while it lasted! It's easy to clean and use, but If you're looking for a long lasting air purifier, it isn't here. It's cheap, which is what I was aiming for. And I got what I pay for, and I honestly shouldn't have expected any better, or less. Bottom line - it works! But for a short while, unless! You maybe use this barely, which in that case, would defeat the purpose of having a air purifier."
1,BOOM !!!,BOOM is all that i got when i tried to plug it in. The air purifier just got fried. also there is no manuall at all. very bad experience. since i'm in Egypt the return is not an option.
1,Breaks down after only a year,"I bought this due to the 'easy' filter maintenance. It worked fine for a year, then the red light went on indicating the filter needed to be cleaned. I cleaned it, and the red light is still on. Front cover is hard to get off. Piece of China junk. Save your money and buy something else that works!"
1,BAD-BAD-BAD,I placed it in my office which is less than 200 sq ft and with it on high I smoked one cigar. Twenty hours later it still smelled of smoke. What a joke.
2,Permanet filter??? Read the fine print!!!,"After a 3 weeks relation with this unit, this is the result: you get what you pay.Get a real one. Permanent filter will cost you +$40, if your room doesn't fill the fine print that says it's ""permanent"".Noisy, after 1 week you hear the ionizer making cracking noises and causing the night light to turn off itself.Save some headaches and get and Oreck.Very disappointing."
2,air purifier,"The performance and quality of this product are great. I am not so certain I got the best price for it, however."
3,Air Purifier Honeywell,"Nice unit, compact, works well, It does the job, however it is noisy on levels II and III. Very nicely priced considering the permanent HEPA filter."
3,Works fine but noisy,I like this little air cleaner but it is so noisy. I placed it in my room and have to turn the tv up due to the noise. Other larger units I have purchased use way less power and are extremely quit on the lower settings. This Honeywell is easy to use and is a great size and I am generally satisfied with it other than the excessive fan noise.
3,Noisy,"As mentioned by other customers, the unit is pretty noisy. I'm a light sleeper, but the noise does not bother me at all. It is good to use it to conceal noise from the street traffic or noise from others in the house. Every once in awhile, the motor/fan go fast and slow and it is kindna ignoring."
4,Use it in a cubicle at work!,"I work in a cubicle and sit at my desk for almost 8 hours a day. I suffer from allergies and asthma. Great combo, I know! I purchased this air purifier and have been using it for almost two months now and it works well. I haven't been sneezing as much and my eyes do not water any more from the dust or allergens in the air. Its not loud and it doesn't take up much room on my desk. I don't regret this purchase at all and would recommend it for small spaces. I bought another one for my bedroom at home. Fresh air...finally!"
3,Noticeable air quality improvement,"Based on the positive Amazon reviews I purchased three units. I have two of them located in smaller rooms in my home and one in my office located outside of the home. I noticed that I was sneezing quite a bit at work and after I placed a unit in my office the sneezing was dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. The noise level of the unit is a bit high, but not to the level of considering it annoying. My only issue is after 4 months one of the three units started to make a grinding noise which sounds as if a bearing is going to fail. As for the other two units we run them 24/7 for over a year and they are running just fine. If it were not for the one faulty unit I would have given this product 5 stars."
5,Honeywell air purifer,Unfortunately when the product arrived it was faulty. However without any quarrel Amazon sent a replacement without waiting for the faulty item to be returned. The replacement has arrive and I have it on every day from early morning until going to bed. I am amazed at the amount of pollution in the air that it has collected in less than one week.
3,It works but it's really loud,I bought this because we heat our downstairs with a woodstove. Lots of ash floating around the living room. But the unit is too loud to have in the living room so I put it in the dining room. I can hear the unit running all the way upstairs. It seems to work though so we just have to turn the TV up a bit to cover the sound.
5,Great!,"I rate this 5 stars! I bought this for my brother for Christmas because he wanted one so bad, so I found this one at a great price! I hope he loves it. I recommend this product to everyone!!"
1,Stop working after six month of intermidiate use!,"I would have loved to give it a 5 star...as the machine preformed well when it worked. The noise was good for us on level one, perfect on level two, loud on three. I only wish it would have lasted longer than 6months."
3,"Works great, but a lot louder than I expected","This does its job, and does it well, but it is definitely on the loud side (annoyingly loud for me)."
4,Air filtration at its finest,This little device really works well. The fan kicks out some serious air. It seems like it does a nice job of keeping the air less stagnate in our office.
2,Loud,"I think whoever says this unit is quiet should probably have their ears checked. Only the lowest fan setting is a barely tolerable level for my ears.However, it does clean air quite well. I've only owned it for a day, so I'll update my review if my unit starts to malfunction like the other low-rating owners'."
2,I'm still not too sure if this unit every did much.,"This air purifier stopped working after a few months. The air never felt especially purified although the mesh filter did have to be cleaned twice. However, after a few months I turned off the unit for a while and when I went to turn it back on, it didn't kick on right away. After a few minutes it would start blowing again. Eventually the purifier died. I wouldn't purchase this model by Honeywell. It's just no that good of an air purifier."
2,Noisy,"I have purchased 2 units, after 10 days one of them started making loud noise. Unable to bear the noise we are switching off the unit at night. Need to contact Honey well or Amazon to replace this one."
1,Broke in 5 seconds,"Started on full power like instructed but within 5 seconds it was billowing out with smoke, is now unusable. Waste of money"
2,Worked somewhat until the smell started,"Had this product running constantly in a small room for about 6 months. I know it did something at least, because I had to clean both filters frequently due to dust. But it never did much of anything against the cigarette smell (I don't smoke, but the rest of the house does). After a few months it began to emit a seriously bad odor. I cleaned everything and let it sit for a few weeks, then let it run for a couple of hours outside. The smell remained. I thought about changing the filter, but golly, isn't it supposed to be permanent? Buyer beware."
3,"Good Filtration, Too Noisey","I believe that the unit filters well. It is louder than I expected, even on low speed. Hi speed is really loud. I'm a little disappointed."
4,Loud but it works,For me it seems a bit loud but for a cheap step into the air cleaning products I like it. Makes a white noise at night. Has a night light and I think it works good enough. Next one I buy will have a remote because we keep it on the floor for the cat hair. You have to bend far down to get to this. Although it would be great for a shelf. My other one is in my office and I turn it on as soon as I get to the office.
4,We like it,We like this item because it cleans the air well in our bedroom. Changing the filter is easy to do.
3,Honeywell Compact Air Purifier,"Its the perfect size for an RV, not as good as the comparable Idylis model but it was cheaper.Time will only tell if it cleans the air as well.Not too loud but great if you need ""white noise"" at night if you are accustomed to it.Aesthetics are fair, it fits into an environment and doesn't look cheap but isn't a work of art either, but hey its an air cleaner."
2,Might have gotten a bad copy,"I hardly use this air purifier because it's really noisy. I think I might have gotten a bad copy because it 'boots up' fine for the first minute on low -- very quiet, sounds like a quiet fan. However, after the minute there is a VERY distinctive high pitched whirring/howling sound that is just completely distracting. I just leave it on when I go to work and turn it off when I come back."
1,Name of the Product is just a Flat-out Lie!,"This is the name of the product: ""Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filter."" That is bald-face lie! I just received the machine today and I read that the filter is a ""Hepa-type filter"" in the manual that comes in the box. So, I go online and look up Hepa filters and find this: ""Many imitations of HEPA filters pervade the marketplace, usually called HEPA-type filters. They are less expensive than true HEPA filters, rated lower, and do an inferior job of filtering the air. If your health requires the specific benefits and efficiency of a HEPA filter, check the packaging to make sure the filter is rated at an efficiency of 99.97% for microns .3 in size. If it's a true HEPA filter, it will have this rating clearly marked."" Source: [...]I have always been satisfied with the service from Amazon, but Honeywell, well that's the last thing I buy from that company. I don't like being lied to, just so they can make a sale."
4,Great Bargain,"This purifier is a must for condo or apartment living. Pros: Gets rid of cigarette and BBQ smoke smells from the neighbors and prevents the smells of Sunday night dinner from lingering until Monday morning. It's also great for allergy sufferers like myself. Cons: The I (first) setting barely makes a sound, but put it on III (three) and you can't hear the TV. Also, DO NOT store this unit flush against a wall. It draws all the dust in your house towards it and that dust lands on (and sticks to) anything surrounding the unit. We have a small black cloud on our white wall that necessitated a repaint, which we planned on anyway. If we hadn't planned on repainting, I would be very upset! Overall, this unit is a GREAT value for the price and a must for anyone still saving to buy their first home."
4,Works pretty good for the most part....,"Bought this for our bedroom in which our 5month old sleeps in there for now, very good on low for white noise however low isnt enough it doesnt seem and medium and high is a little loud, no problem though just crank it up when you arent sleeping. This unit will cool the room down a bit though, been using it throughout the winter and needed a space heater to make up for the cool air it produces (should be perfect for summer), but no biggie cool air is fresh air. Cleared out the slight dog smell and air is definately cleaner. I would recommend this product, does its job well on high and holds its own on low."
4,6 Hours In. NOTICIBLE difference in air quality!!!,"I have only had this item for a day now and have been using for only 6 hours or so but the air quality is ""cleaner"". My wife and I smoke indoors, we have 3 cats, 3 dogs, and live in a farming area that kicks dust into the air CONSTANTLY!!! I wash my car, NEXT DAY there is a layer of dust/silt/dirt settled. This item is long overdue. I did purchase 3 different purifiers, this one is first to arrive so I cannot compare it to any other systems. It is loud on max speed setting but that is too much for my smaller bedroom(10x15), low works just fine and is background noise I barely notice unless I want to. I hope to add to this review later when the other two systems arrive.if you want this product but are ""worried"" don't be. It does what it's made to do!"
1,Noise Maker,"Works well, extremely loud! . Good for the deaf. Grinder makes much less noise. To Loud! So simply don't buy."
1,problems with unit and Amazon,"Defective. I had to send it back to the manufacturer after they recommended that I return it to Amazon. Amazon did not respond to my request, so Kaz (Honeywell) accepted return. I still haven't received a replacement, and it cost me $11.88 in return postage. This was a replacement for the exact same model I've had for 4 years which was just too dirty to clean up. My original worked just fine. worked just fine. I really liked it."
5,"Even with 2 cats, does the job","I bought this purifier hoping for some relief from my wife's 2 cats. We put this in the back room (where the litter box is), and it is working like a charm - except for immediately after a ""deposit"", there is no smell emanating from the back room.Note the size of the room, however - it isn't going to work in a big room. Our back room is about 5x8, and it works fine for that size."
5,Efficient little quiet machine,"I have many air cleaners as I suffer with allergies. I think this is the best of all of all machines big & small. It is quiet, efficient, and it does the job. I am buying another one."
1,Deception,"You said in your listing and even on this page that this has a HEPA filter. But when we received and installed the manual says it is a ""HEPA LIKE"" filter. The item is nothing more than a fan and a cheap cloth filter that can be purchased for a fraction of the price paid, but more important it is not filtering the air like a true HEPA filter. I would return it except that you will probably charge me for shipping both ways and tax even if you agreed to accept it. Being HEPA is like being pregnant. You cannot be pregnant like ."
1,Doesn't work for dust,"This thing does nothing for sucking up dust in the air. If your house is filled with cigarette smoke, maybe you'll find some value in it. I sure didn't."
1,Died after 9 months,I have had 5 other Honeywell filters over the past 10 years. 2 of them I currently still have and they work fine. They constantly run. Constantly. This didn't live up to the bigger and older honeywells. I'm disappointed in this product.
1,Honeywell HHT-011,"I bought this because it said it was quiet on low setting. Wrong! I live in a small house and with the setting on low it can be heard everywhere. It is impossible to watch tv or sleep with this thing running. This was a complete waste of time and money. My first response was to toss it in the trash can, but think I will save it for the next yard sale. It would probably be okay for someone with a large house or noisy kids."
3,It's okay,"It is a little more noisy than I expected. I use it in my bedroom, and have to put the TV louder when using it, but have gotten used to the loudness. It doesn't stop me from a good night sleep. I like the air exchange in the room."
2,Powerful but too noisy,"I went with the crowd on this one, but after a couple of hours of use I couldn't handle the noise. Far too loud to have on my desk at work."
4,Works well---,"This air purifier certainly has a bit of power for such a small item. It works well in my bedroom, I don't find it to be too loud at all, sure it would have been nice if it was just a bit quieter but it is definitely tolerable. The only thing I do no care for is the cover for the filter will easily come loose if you bump it. Also, it doesn't seem to be quite level, if I don't have it in just the right position (no matter where it is) it will rattle. However, it functions just as it should and this aren't even really 'complaints' just points of observation."
5,Wonderful one room air purifier,Wonderful air purifier for a single room! The price on Amazon was fantastic. I purchased one for me awhile ago and bought this one for a present because it was the best I have found. Washable filter is a huge plus! Replacing a filter is expensive. The person who got it for a present loves it as do I!
4,"Exaclty as listed, but be careful if you have asthma","This product was delivered in a timely fashion and worked exactly as it was described. It is relatively quiet on low and I am happy enough with it. However, be careful if you have asthma like me. The ionization option is an asthma trigger. It is listed in the instruction manual, but a lot of these purifiers work with ionizers, so watch out. You can turn it off, but what you are left with is a glorified vacuum filter with a tiny fan. I was disappointed, but again, not with the product itself so much as the fact that I was not warned about that up front."
1,"""MMMM, tastes good!""","""MMMM, tastes good!"" That's exactly what my 7 year old daughter said the first time I put this on her fingers, and had her stick one in her mouth. For us, this had been a complete failure of a product. Maybe I will just have to use Tobasco sauce."
1,The same as clear nail polish,"Save yourself the trouble and don't bother purchasing this,I was looking for help with my nail-biting habit, bought this item, used it, but it doesn't taste that bad and it's just like clear nail polish, the smell and everything."
1,Found it useless,"I bought this today after finally getting fed up with biting my nails (I'm seventeen, and have bit them for as long as I can remember) and found that it doesn't stop me from biting at all. It's too mild. In fact, I enjoy the taste, and find myself even more drawn to biting them. I'm very disappointed, and wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
4,IT DOES TASTE DISGUSTING!,"I recently bought this product because as a waitress, nobody likes to see you gnaw on your nails, then serve them their food. It was cheap so I gave it a try. I read some reviews after I first purchased it to see what I was in for. Against what other people said, I used it a few times a day anyway.The reviews that say it doesn't have a taste at all must have not followed the directions properly. It specifies to use it after washing you hands and before bed. It dries relatively fast, so I did this. I feel like the taste gets WORSE after every time I apply it. There IS a very nasty taste that stays in your mouth and makes me regret putting my finger anywhere near my mouth.If you follow the directions, and apply it after you wash your hands, or even just throughout the day when you get a chance, it has the right effect. I haven't stopped biting my nails yet, its only been about a week, but this product sure makes me want to stop as soon as possible. :)"
5,Great Product,"I have used this product before and it worked really well for me. Unlike other products I have used, Bite No More goes on clear and looks like clear nail polish. Others have turned my nails yellow."
5,Surprising,"Okay, so I found this product from a friend, who let me try it first. Downside, I have some chicken from happy hour stuck in my teeth...upside, this nail polish tasted bad enough that I'd rather just leave it in there."
2,Does not work,Does not have bitterness required to deter biting even when applied thickly. Recommend spending more for something that works. I believe the reviewer who wrote this product would not even work on a baby.
2,"High Hopes, Big Let Down","I'm a firm believer of not subjecting my son to anything I wont try myself, so we did a test together... applied as directed to all of his nails, and one of mine. After it dried I tried to taste it and couldn't taste ""bitter"", or any taste at all. And, my son was chewing within 20 min like no difference. I wasted my money... awesome"
5,Excellent! Excelente!,This is an excellent example of how an investigation should be made. You should read it! You will discover the truth!Es una excelente ejemplo de sómo debe hacerse una investigación. Debes leerlo! Descubrirás la verdad! Es el mejor libro sobre los atentados del 11 de septiembre.Très bon! Lisez-en!
1,This product is made in China,"I used to like this product until I learned that it is made in China!How many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in China, contaminated baby formula made in China, contaminated tooth paste made in China, and poisoned pet food before we learn that -- if it comes from China-- it should not go in your mouth, your baby's mouth, or your pet's mouth??!!!"
5,Great Almond Crunch!!,My husband and both love almonds. I've even shared this snack with co-workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack. I'm taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip.
1,Made in China?!,Mrs. May's should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. I won't be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. Do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in China. Totally frightening what they're getting away with.
2,"Tastes great but pkg says ""Made in China"" so I won't buy it again",Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack. If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.
1,"""Health food"" from China? Doubtful","This product is made in China. I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher. Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore."
4,Lucy's vocal best,"Lucille Ball can sing through most of these number showing she can sing! Her voice had only been showcased in Dance Girl, Dance, DuBarry was a Lady, and the Long, Long Trailer, but her Lucy's voice shines. Most of the songs are carried out to vocal excellency especially ""Hey Look Me Over!"" For any Lucy fan this CD is a must, and it is ten times better than the Mame soundtrack. (Personally, I only like there the numbers ""Open a New Window"" and ""Bosom Buddies."")"
1,HORRIBLE,"I can't remember where I purchased this (Walmart, etc..), but it was definitely NOT money well spent. I don't know how they can label this as ""spill proof"", as that's all it does is spill. It may not spill out of the gas can on its own, but try putting gas into something - gas runs everywhere BUT into the piece of equipment you're trying to fill up.The self-venting/""spill proof"" mechanism works by you rotating it, and then pulling the large outside ring towards you. As you do this, you have to try to get the hard plastic nozzle down and into the item you're filling without any of the gas coming out - MUCH trickier than it sounds. I'd rather spend an afternoon trying to figure out the Rubik's cube than this piece of junk.Save your money and spend it on one of the other more expensive gas cans that got better reviews. I bought this one and the 1 gallon can for my weed trimmer. I haven't even used the 1 gallon can because the 2.5 gallon can is so awful."
5,i wanna fight!!!,"Hay people!! I was really excited that i found inferno and that hasbro is bringin out all the old transformers again. if u guys ever watched the transformers cartoon u would know who inferno is, he never came out till the second season. he was always with red alert. he is a great addition too add too ur collection he isnt made out of metal like prowl or bluestreak, but he is still good too have.. too bring back old memories. these things arnt here for little kids its for people like me who are young at heart and grew up with these things. inferno turns into a fire truck, he is much taller then prowl and the others. i recomend him to your collection. thanks for readin!!"
3,Cool,I wasn't a big Inferno fan as a kid. Not of the toy or the cartoon version. Now having the toy I see some upsides. I like how the fists or weapons can be shot out of his arms. I pose mine in the base command part of one of my 3 Powermaster Optimus Primes (the original G1 version). He is nice to add to a collection. I like his ladder in firetruck mode and I like his weapons in robot mode.
3,Not what I remember,"I bought this since I thought this was an old favorite DVD when I was little but looking back, it just makes no sense and is really redundant. I only recommend for little children to watch."
5,Thumbelina DVD,"I haven't actually opened the DVD, as it is a gift. But it appears to be in the original packaging, so I will assume its new, or at the very least in good shape. We shall know, come Christmas time.Other than that, quick delivery and fairly priced :)"
2,Disappointed,Scratched. Skipping on the first play. Didn't return due to time. Id rather buy a new one first from now on.
5,LO V E,"I love Thumbelina! I remember watching it as a kid and I had it on VHS, so I was like I want that movie on DVD. I have watched it multiple times and I am not ashamed to watch it :)"
4,One of the sweetest movies I have ever seen...,"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I've enjoyed it since I was little, and I still enjoy it now.Personally, I don't understand why so many people (especially critics) hate this movie. True, the animation may not be the greatest, but so what? Who says animation has to be top-notch in order for the movie to be good? And the music is great, too. Even ""Marry the Mole"" is not such a bad song. I don't understand why it received an award for ""Worst Original Song"". I don't agree with the message, of course, but it's still got a catchy tune, and I often find myself singing along to it.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, of course, but maybe you movie critics out there are being a tad too harsh."
4,Good Little Girl Movie,"Unlike some other people, I enjoyed watching Thumbelina. I am almost twenty-two and I just bought the DVD for myself. I remembered watching it as a child and I wanted to see it again. Thumbelina, a teeny-weeny girl, falls in love with a handsome fairy prince and he promises to love her for always. She is kidnapped by toads, a bettle, and is almost forced to marry a disgusting but ardent mole. In the end, after being chased by all of her unwanted suitors, her prince finds at the Vale of the Fairies and they are wed. The animation in the movie needs to be cleaned up a bit, but it is okay. Thumbelina is not one of the best movies that I have seen, but it is still pleasing. I still have a little girl inside of me and I long to be swept off my feet by my true love. I think that if people lose all of their youthful innocence and fantasies, they are left dull. That is why I like Thumbelina."
5,Great Kid's Movie,"i have loved this movie since i was a kid and i think it's sad thta children of this generation have no good cartoon movies to watch that don't have to do with animee. this movie is filled with songs and sweet characters. although not made by disney, this movie can still be wonderful for children. now being older, i still watch this movie from time to time and love it just as much as i did as a young kid. it's great!"
4,Thumbs up!,"Despite the very mixed reviews, we decided to give this one a try.My 3 1/2 year old loves it and it has become her new favorite movie. She loves Thumbelina and is delighted she has the same voice as Ariel (The Little Mermaid). The music is upbeat and catchy (and I'm NOT a big fan of Barry Manilow). OK, Thumbelina is a bit wimpy but not much more so than any other fairytale princess. A charming movie parents won't mind watching with their kids."
5,Plus 5 and 5 more,"My 4 year old grand daughter enjoyed this movie so much. It was so incredibl to watch her relate to the music. And towards the end, she smiled so big, she clapped her hands with job, and she walked to bed dancing. This will definitely become one of her favorite movies. This was a excellent buy."
1,Avoid,"What a terrible, depressing film. As we were watching, my three year old daughter kept insisting that this was not the 'real' movie, and wanted us to fast forward! I can see what she meant -- the scenes just kept getting weirder and weirder, with Thumbelina just going along for the ride. Evil frogs. Evil Mice. Evil moles. Evil beetles. Evil story. Evil plot. Pink headed dog thing that makes Goofy look good. 30 second love affair in the first few minutes. 30 second marriage to wrap it up. 2 hours of pain in between.Life is too short to spend on this junk. Want interesting, non-Disney heroines that you wouldn't mind your children emulating? Try Kikis Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro. Want a beautiful movie with good voice acting and story? Watch Nemo again. Whatever you do, avoid Thumbelina."
1,Booooring,"Frankly, this was a pretty disappointing movie. I thank God there were no bad jokes, but the plot was in neutral for the whole two hours. Thumblina says that ""She's going home,"" and 45 minutes later she says the same thing. The slow plot probably has to do with the slew of characters she met along the way. You couldn't remember them all if you took notes! From barn animals, to fairies, to jitterbugs, to frogs, to beetles, and so on and so on... Argh! It was just a flat out boring movie, I'm sorry."
1,"Oh, Let me be your wings............... (gag!)","This must be one of the most annoying movies on earth! Thumbelina's brain is germ-sized, and she doesn't even know how to stick-up for herself, and say ""no."" Every time an animal wants to marry her, she'll just let them do it, depending on her big-strong handsome boyfriend to do the rest! (sticks finger in the throat) GAG! GAG! GAG! That ""heroine"" in the movie isn't much of a heroine.If you'r sick of those Damsel-in-distress-waits-for-her-beloved-prince-to-come-and-save-her movies, I'd recommend ANASTASIA or MULAN! At least THOSE girls know how to defend themselves!!!!!!!"
5,Still a favorite of my daughter.....,Still a favorite of my daughter.....Thumbelina...a sweet movie about a tiny little girls fun to watch for all ages!~ My daughter watched is as a child and is now watching it with her college girlfriends....
4,Pleasant and Endearing,"We've become so accustomed to computer animation that we are slowly forgetting to appreciate the beauty of hand-drawn animation. This tale of Thumbelina was wonderful, in story and in artistry. The songs were quite good, particularly the ballad which was definitely worthy of Disney. My 5-year-old daughter fell in love with this movie and in a world where crass humor has become the norm for children's programming, I'm so glad that I found something like this where she could enjoy a purely lovely story."
5,Thumbelina,great movie. arrived in short amount of time after order. i definitely recommend this movie!
1,Product in not working condition,this CD does NOT work.On one side you can watch for 9 min. and it frose.On another side for 25 min. before it lock itself.Tarrible.
3,not a classic but..,"bought it for my 4 year old, found the movie difficult for that age to understand. Would recommend for kids above 6yrs of age."
3,Disney Alternative is worth a go for your little ones,Our 3 year old loves this movie! The voices (and singing) are wonderful although the supporting character animation is a bit garish compared to the 'main' characters of Thumbelina and the Fairy Prince.
2,Disappointing and annoying,"So many times during this movie, I wanted to scream ""Fight for yourself!"" to Thumbelina. I am not familiar with the story of Thumbelina - but it just seems like such a bad story if the movie is accurate. I am trying not to have my daughters buy into the whole princess thing too much. (As I say this, our house has Disney princess stuff all over it.) However, this movie leaves me very disappointed. She believes what others think about her and doesn't find her self worth in herself. At the end of the movie, she fights a little bit, but there are other girlie movies that have much better messages."
3,This was a pretty good movie,"We would've given this a higher rating, but the freaky bugs, george washington chickens, punk ox, the can-can birds, the dog and the bird (Jacquapo, and if that's not how you spell his name I couldn't care less). Cornelius could really lose the cowlick and thumbelina's weird bang thing could use an adjustment. Their romance blossomed very quickly. The only songs we liked ""Let me be your wings"" and ""marry the mole!"" THe mouse was so cute, but the mole was really freaking us out.And Thumbelina's hairdo at the end could change. But the best character has to be the pink-haired frog. ANd the beetle. Though i must say, the frog who wants to marry Thumbelina made up his mind quicker than Cornelius (which is saying something). Just two seconds, and he says ""Mother...I love her"" (even though I don't know anything about her).Disney could have made it better.We know and understand that this review probably wasn't the best or most convincing one, but we felt like writing it anyway."
4,Thumbelina,An excellent children's film that is still captivating enough to enchant those who are still young at heart.
1,After Swim Shampoo,I am really not that impressed with this shampoo. My hair is a natural platinum and this shampoo does not removethe chlorine from my hair after swimming. And I have a filter on my bathtub shower head. Sorry.
3,movies skipped a lot,"I bought these so that I could burn my movies at the highest quality possible. I even burned them at the slowest speed. When I tried to play them, most of them skipped so much it was ridiculous. When I burned the same movie on regular dvd-r, it played just fine. Don't know if it was my burner or just a bad set, but I ended up having to throw most of them away."
1,Printable that don't work,"Bought this printable Ridata, can't burn in my computer with a LACIE burner, with a duplicator and in an independent lab, didn't work, I trow away and said good bye to my money.Don't buy it. The no printable work OK."
1,Don't bother with this one,"Bought 100 - the first 10 have failed to burn, while other brands have done fine. Don't waste your money and time."
4,Marillion Rediscovered,"Now as a 33 year old music lover, I have recently rediscovered the Marillion I loved so passionately back in '87 when I purchased Clutching at Straws. In just over three weeks I have purchased just about every Hogarth era album (except Radiation and Holidays Eden) and listened in awe! I regret not getting Seasons End back in '89 when I saw it ... I think I was (naively) put off knowing that Fish was no longer part of the magic. However, after listening to this album I hear so much of the late eighties Marillion, and appreciate how the band has matured - culminating in their recent effort Anoraknophobia, which too is a wonderful beautifully crafted album. Seasons End has shown that the band still had so much potential. Favourites on this album have to be Seasons End, The Space ... and the beautiful Easter ... but every Marillion song (on all their albums) provides the listener with a wonderful piece of music. Don't try to pigeon-hole this band - they are just too talented!"
2,irc ...,Nothing at all against the new singer. The trouble is that the material in this album just isn't good enough ...
4,A new beginning,"This is the first album wihtout Fish and the first with Steve Hoggart.At this period, I remember that this album deceived me a lot, but as time goes by, I have to learn to appreciate the new Marillion. After many albums done with Hoggart, I can say that this is a very good one. This album has it all, prog as in the good old days, beautiful ballads and rock songs. ""Easter"", ""Seasons End"", ""After me"" and ""The Space"" are truly great compositions. I don't have the remastered version at this moment, but I sure will soon. I am very pleased with this album."
5,The Transition Album plus bonus....,This album marked the debut of Steve Hogarth as vocalist. Most of the music was written before he entered the band so musically it isn't a great departure from previous albums. I love this album from start to finish H sings his butt off and the band really shows how good they were at this point in blending it all together. The bonus disc has some extra songs that did not make the album plus some different mixes of songs on the album a great deal. A must for fans of both eras of the band and people who just love good music. Definetly not as experimental as the albums after it but a good place to start.
5,transition,"I love Seasons End, it has a freshness and exitement about being at the border of two eras of Marillion, a real energy, combined with the bands taste and refinement. The Space and Seasons end are awsome. Get the double CD For the Bell in the Sea and the uplifting Releace"
4,The first transition album of the Hogarth era Marillion,"This has some strong tracks (Easter, especially) but in the end it seems more of a growing album, especially considering the old lead singer Fish just left the band. I started listening to Marillion after this album came out, and was much more impressed with Fish's first solo ""Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors"". The benefit of the 2-CD version of Seasons End is the two B-Sides, ""The Release"" and ""The Bell in the Sea"" which are good -- good enough for the A-Side. (""The Bell in the Sea"" alone makes me want to give the album 5 stars, but the uninspired middle section of Berlin and Holloway Girl stop me from doing so. They're good songs, but needed something else to boost them.) It took me a while to get the album in the first place because of a song with a dorky title like ""Hooks in You"", but it's actually has a good beat, even though it seems to be a reinvention of ""Incommunicato"" from the last album ""Clutching at Straws""."
3,3 1/2 STARS,"SOLID CD OVERALL - HOGARTH ON VOCALS (1ST CD WITH MARILLION) - I REALLY LIKE THE TITLE TRACK AND EASTER - THE REASON I DON'T RATE IT 4 OR 5 STARS IS BECAUSE A COUPLE OF SONGS IN MY OPINION SEEM TO GO NOWHERE (UNINVITED GUEST, HOOKS IN YOU) - OVERALL, A GOOD EFFORT CONSIDERING A NEW VOCALIST JOINED THE SCENE - MARILLION DEFINITELY SOUNDED DIFFERENT ONCE FISH LEFT THE GROUP - THE BEGINNING OF THE HOGARTH ERA WAS HERE AND IT TOOK A LITTLE GETTING USED TO (FISH HAD A STYLE ALL HIS OWN)"
2,Disappointing,"An absolutely disappointing album from the brillant 80s prog-band Marillion.Fish's unique voice and lyrics' absence had left Marillion in a desperate helpless situation, where Steve Hogarth's replacement was a poor effort only.I would recommend Marillion's previous albums, especially the perfect trilogy of ""Script For A Jester's Tear - Fugazi - Misplaced Childhood"" for the ones who will start listening to Marillion."
3,"Great formula, but doesn't look good","I tried this lip balm after having used the original Beeswax Lip Balm for quite some time. It's a very good formula, and it's great for being in the snow or for water sports. What I didn't like is that it leaves a sheer white layer on your lips, it doesn't go on clear. If you don't care about how your lips look and you want a product that will work very well, I recommend it. But if you do care, I recommend the original one."
4,Very moisterizing..don't like the white color it leaves behind..,I was in a rush in the drug store and couldn't decide between LifeGaurds choice and the regular kind..my mistake.This leaves a whitish color on your lips that makes them appear dry and lifeless..However the moisterizing is AMAZING.What I do now is wear this to bed and if my lips need some TLC in the morning I'm just sure to wear a brightening lipgloss/lipstick over it to cover the white tint! I never burn so I don't know how effective this is against burning..But its definitely a wonderful lip balm.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I should have read the only other review. The DVD indeed only shows a series of female nudes, accompanied by music. No commentary whatsoever. Judging from the CD box and the DVD itself, this looks like some homemade DVD, rather than a professional production."
4,Joint aches,Had some knee aches in the joints and bones and some elbow aches so I tried this. Problems have dissipated with use I believe.
1,I returned,To be fair i never tried i just did not like the ingredients if i am taking supplements i like to go for more natural ingredients not fillers
5,humorous & educational,"this is a great book for a novice or anyone who wants to better understand the world around them. it is funny,entertaining,educational,and easy to understand! i thoughly enjoyed it and ordered several other books by the same author!"
1,Poor Copy-editing,"While this is a great true story, I cannot recommend this Kindle edition, which is wrought with typographical errors and seems to have not been copy-edited for layout. I've returned mine, and I'm hoping a cleaner Kindle copy becomes available."
2,pt barnun,I think the story is interesting and a good read but the print is so hard to read . It seems like it was printed on a machine that was out of ink so it is unpleasant and uncomfortable to read so I am losing interest. If there is a problem there maybe you could look into it. I would love to have the book with a nicer print.
1,NOT 8190 which is for 1 six pack of part # 0574,I ordered this accel 8190 which is suppose to be for a blister pack of six spark plugs item no.0574 but you only receive 1 plug of the 0574 not 6. The title should be fixed to say 1 accel spark plug no. 0574 not the item no. 8190 which is for a six pack of 0574 plugs i had to file a claim with amazon to get a refund for the misleading title. just look at the detailed information on the page.# Product Dimensions: 8.3 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches# Shipping Weight: 10.4 ounces so 1 plug weighs 10.4 ounces must be a big plug.
5,amazing,"This is an amazing album. Matt Wertz comes through as always. Great quality product as well. My favorite songs include 5:19, Carolina, and I will not take my love away. It's an album anyone should own."
4,good music,"It is cute!Too bad I dont know where I put the CD, I am bad at keeping track of where I left my stuff"
4,British Militaria in all its splendor,"For the small band of us who can never adequately satisfy our desire to see and hear British military bands and especially the Guards, this is a wonderful opportunity to experience the splendor and pageantry from our own homes. Numerous clips of ceremonies such as Trooping the Colour, the Ceremony of the Keys, the Opening of Parliament, etc. are included. Quality is somewhat spotty of course given the difficulty of adequate microphone placement outdoors with marching bands etc. but all in all is quite good and certainly beats having to jostle with crowds in front of Buckingham Palace. The sequence depicting the Band of the Coldstream Guards in their winter greatcoats marching on to the tune ""the Voice of the Guns"" is worth the price alone."
1,Aging....,"This is not good game and the graphics are dated. I really purchased this as an add-on to Pacific Fighters,which is also produced by Ubisoft.The level of realisim and flight models are very poor and the control setup and user interface are very user unfriendly and would be very difficult for the novice,desktop flyer. Over all,this is the worst Sim/Flying-game ever made. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Amazing Flight-Game,"Awesome game with sick graphics and detailed, good-looking planes. Flight dynamics are out of this world, and campaign mode is awesome. Now you could get into the cockpit of jet-powered planes, something that was unavailable in Il-2 Sturmovik. To sum it all up, Amazing flight game!!"
5,Super,"If you are into aircraft this is one of the best. Once you get the hang of it, and with a good feedback controller, it is great. Time gets away from me."
5,"Great product, great seller!","The product was great, exactly as advertised, and delivered ahead of schedule. I had one contact with the seller, and they were prompt, courteous and professional in their response. I would definitely use this seller again!"
4,Passed all tests,"Picky husband accepted these. He is very tall, and particular about clothing. Lots of specifications to the way they have to fit him besides just a simple waist and leg measurement (38w 34inseam). He talks about ""rise"" and whether or not the thigh area is generous enough. I just keep trying, and return them if they are rejected. He was pleased with the fit of these, and I was happy because they are wrinkle resistant."
3,Takes a few washings....,"Takes a few washings to get it soft. It's pretty stiff and scratchy initially. Otherwise, it looks great and repels liquids! I spilled punch on it and the punch beaded right off. Amazing material!"
2,These pants SHRINK after just a few washes!,"I bought these pants for my husband less than a month ago, and they have already shrunk TWO INCHES in length, its like I wasted my money. Do NOT buy these pants with your true inseam, they will be too small in a month!"
2,Not as durable as described,"I bought two pairs of these pants about three months ago on the strength of their reviews and their low cost. Cut to the present, wearing each pair once a week to work, and one pair's crotch has just completely torn open. I guess you get what you pay for. Up until the crotch tore out, they were comfortable and stain resistant, so I guess if you really need a pair of decent looking slacks NOW and don't have the cash/care if they last long, these are the pants for you."
4,Hold up well to wear to work,These pants hold up well with fit and no ironing after washing.They hold the crease well and always look neat and sharp.My husband looks very polished dressed in pants like these.
4,Great value. Not very relaxed.,"This pants are great for work. The price is nice, but they are not as relaxed as I though."
5,Satisfying product by Lee,This is surely a value for money item. It fits me nicely. The material is light and suits the tropical climate of Malaysia. Casual and yet can be worn to the office. Would certainly buy this item again.
2,Nice but too small,"This was my second pair of Lee pants from Amazon. The first pair were of good quality. On this pair the waist came in two inches less than every other pair I own in this size - I measured. I could snap the button but had to forgo breathing. The return process was fairly straight-forward but I got stuck with the return shipping in the end. It was deducted from my refund. Otherwise the price would have been nice and I would have loved the pants if they fit, but this experience was definitely dissatisfying."
5,Simply splendid!,"These pants are wonderful!!! They have a decidedly generous cut, handsome styling, and cause the very best hallucinations I have ever had. I saw rainbows, fiery phoenixes, Oompaloompas and fairy princesses minutes after trying them on. I don't know how Lee is able to make pants that tune into the sub-conscience, but they did it! My most enthusiastic recommendation!"
1,quality??,I got two pairs of these pants after believing the reviews but was disapointed. The quality is not worth the money. I could get much better pants at cheaper prices at the mall. This was my first online shopping experience for dresses and am never doing the same mistake again.
2,LEE'S 1 WAIST SIZE T0 SMALL,"THE OTHER KAKAIS I PURCHASED ON WERE 100% GREAT BUT I SPILT BLEACH ON ONE OF THEM. COULD FIND THE SAME VENDOR OR MAKE, SO I BOUGHT THE SAME SIZE BY LEE. BIG MISTAKE. GREAT PANTS IF THEY FIT. 46WAISTx32LONG. O'WELL I'LL GO BACK TO WALKING."
3,Missing description,"These pants have a wrinkle resistant coating on them, which was not mentioned in the description. I did not want them, because of health concerns. Therefore, I returned them."
4,Average,"My dad bought a pair of these. It really shows off his buns of ""steel"".Thanks for 3 seconds of your time."
4,Nice,"First off, they are really cheap pants.They feel very comfortable.Lee's sizing is consistent because they make all their clothes in Mexico unlike Levis that makes the same model pants in various countries depending ont he size you order.My only grip is they seem to lose their dark black color fast. Also, dust and dirt shows up quickly and seems to fade the color."
4,Average Qualilty but Excellent Value.,"Everything about these pants I would describe as ""average"". The material, the fit, colour, sizing, style, etc., are all Ok. BUT, when I consider the price I paid, around $35 delivered to me in Sydney, the VALUE is EXCELLENT. For something similar I would have to pay somewhere between $75 and $150 and then spend extra time and money to have them shortened (fractional leg lengths are rare down under). Delivery was good, too. I received the pants ahead of the quoted delivery time."
4,nice size but quality is not that high,good sizing and fitting but damage with time between legs. it can be used for people who dot wear it frequently.
2,one size does not fit!,"I initially purchased a 29 X 30 waist Khaki colored pant and was very pleased with it. Its was a hard to find size and fitted perfectly. Encouraged by this I went on to purcahse two more string and grey colored kahkis. Unfortunately, both were much more tighter than the earlier ones and when measured by tape its 28.3-28.5 waist. There seems to be too much variation in the waist size despite a being sold as a 29 waist. I will be very reluctant to buy this brand again...atleast not online.Material-wise its excellent....so 2 stars!"
2,buyer be weary,"All of my pants are 36 x 32 while the leg length is fine for the Lee Jeans Men's Wrinkle Resistant Relaxed Double Pleat Pant, Khaki the waist was more like a 34in.If the sizing was correct I would be very satisfied with the product."
5,Long-lasting and Very Fragrant,Beautiful soap. A new favorite; the scent is so delicate and the soap is not at all drying. I will certainly be buying this again.
4,Bart Heslip Provides Most of the Heroics,"Adam Espinosa arrives in San Francisco with a female companion on a flight from Mexico City. After emptying the contents of a safe deposit box, he is murdered. At the time of the killing Kathy Onoda is receiving a delinquent auto payment from Kasimir Pivarski at the DKA office.Dan Kearny is served a notice of complaint by the state licensing board regarding DKA's handling of the payment. Kathy Onoda dies unexpectedly of a massive blood clot leaving Kearny without a witness to the transaction. Kearny sends agents scurrying to find another witness in order to save his license.The license hearing threads its way throughout the book. Bart Heslip provides most of the heroics. GONE, NO FORWARDING is an entertaining mystery novel but not the very best of the successful DKA series."
2,"The emphasis is on ""highlights""","This video is somewhat disappointing, as it contains very few full performances. It's better than nothing, but it is in no way comparable to the actual coverage of the Olympic games. The ""behind the scenes"" sections are few and far between, and if you taped the Olympics, this will probably disappoint you. END"
4,Best. Olympics. Ever.,"The best skating in the best Olympics ever. There are some full performances on here, but not all. But it's a very good overview!"
1,Errors!,"I purchased this book because of the number of practice tests included, but won't make it that far within the book because, based on the number of errors I have seen so far, I don't want to waste time taking practice tests that might contain confusing errors.I made it through the first study/practice section which is ""Logic Games"" and there were so many mistakes with regard to answers/explanations of the practice games, that I have decided not to continue on to the other sections.It's hard to believe someone would publish a book without having a few people proofread it first."
1,do not buy this trash!,"This is so bad that it will do more harm than good. If this is the best that Harvard students can do, then we should all be able to qualify for Harvard."
1,This book does not use REAL test questions,"And that should be the deciding factor.Yes, that's right, this book MAKES UP ITS OWN test questions. You don't want that. If you're getting ready to take the LSAT, you should be working with ACTUAL test questions that have been asked in the past.You won't see any repeat questions, but the tests are designed such that they are standardized as much as possible.If you want to do poorly on the LSAT, buy this book. It will not adequately prepare you for REAL test questions. If you want to do better, look to books that use REAL test questions, such as Kaplan and Princeton Review. LSAC's books will give you actual old tests, but they won't give you advice for how to approach each question. Get the LSAC books once you've worked through Kaplan and/or Princeton Review and just need additional practice."
3,nothing to complain about,this was a decent album all the song were good i've got nothing to complain about but nothing really stuck out its not a cd that i listen to on a regular basis when i'm sick of listening to albums i've heard a thousand times i'll throw this in and its always refrehing but nothing i'd really sit back and invest my full attention in. if your into thrash or speed metal it's a nice addition to your collection but dont make it a top priority on your list of cds to get theres plenty of others in the same genre that will leave a lasting impression
5,Great News For Manchester Fans! Third Book to be Completed!!,"The long awaited third book in a trilogy about the stupendous life of Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill by renowned historian William Manchester is to be completed at last! Finally, millions of devout fans will be able to buy the book, set for publication in 2007.Before he died, Manchester chose a long- time friend, admirer, and writer to finish the task.Paul Reid, a former feature writer at a Florida newspaper has been a life long history- lover and admirerer of both Manchester and Churchill.Interested in Mr. Reid, I read some of his articles. They are amazing. Evocotive of Mr. Manchester's style in the way they flow easily along, the articles are a great read, no matter the subject.I am excited to hear that the book is coming out in 2007, and will note the date on my calendar.IT'S COMING AT LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"A great read for history, to see a parallel to todays US politicians or to see todays need for a great orator.","Churchill spent most of the early years in the 30's speaking to unmoved politicians bent on their own agenda. The overriding agenda of this time period was pacifism, isolationism and appeasement. To see how Churchill became the Lion by never giving up on warning, alerting and cajoling of the coming cataclysmic events ending with the onslaught of WWII is indeed the definition of a Lion. His prey was a wishy-washy parliament and three Prime Ministers. His undaunting wishes, mostly for country, but also for himself and his well thought out schemes to acquire knowledge of German events leading up to war are fascinating, funny and intriguing. A long story well documented and true. Recommended highly."
2,huge disappointment,"The author's single minded attack on the appeasers make me wonder if the older generations are really that stupid--but experiences tell me that cannot be. I cannot believe that Chamberlain and others would be so stupid as to ignore all these ""facts"" as piled by Manchester--and Machester never really dug into the mindset of the people with different opinions. The books just goes on and on repeating how terrible these appeasers are without letting us how these people reached their conclusions, and what the public was like back then in general."
3,great style but historical mistakes.,amazing style and this is the best known and sold book about churchill . unfortunately purple prose and some historic mistakes are in this book . you should add martin gilbert books to know the man better . book number three for 2011.
5,A c;ear analysis of this century's rise to power.,"Manchester's second volume on Churchill provides a perspicuous account of Churchill's rise, fall and ultimate ascent to power. Perhaps no other narrative affords such an intimate insight into Churchill's wit, wisdom, and prescient views of the rise of the National Socialists in Germany. Manchester details how Churchill's lonely stand againts the NAZIS cost him is rank and privilege in Parliament. Ultimately, Churchill's premonitions came true, and he alone was called upon to save England, and the free world, from the barbarous deeds of the NAZIS. A must read."
5,We're left hanging,"I cannot praise this book in any better fashion than those before me. However, I must plead with Mr. Manchester's heirs to bring together the material gathered for volume three. Following his wife's death in 1998, Manchester had a stroke, and announced he wouldn't be able to finish volume three. On June 1st of this year, he passed away. Just as Martin Gilbert took over Randolph Churchill's task of writing his father's official biography, surely the Manchester heirs could find an author who could do justice to the research this great author had done on the third volume."
5,outstanding read,I love the way the author reveils how Sir Winston was a man ruled by his views of England's 17th and 18th century. World Power status - its customs - mannerisms- and manly conduct. He was a True World hero - who had he not been around in the 30's to mid 40's our todays world might (would) different in every aspect of world events.
5,best book i've read,"this is the best book i've read. period. and i've read alot of books!this is the middle volume in william manchester's 3-part series on churchhill. it covers the years pre-WW2 when Churchhill was a lone voice against Hitler & fascism.why did this book affect me so much? for one, it may be the greatest historical account of courage I've ever read. churchhill was ostracized and even laughed at for what were then unpopular views. he ended up being amazingly right and one can ponder what the world would be like today if it had not been for churchhill. he literally may have saved humanity.beyond this, churchill is simply one of the most fascinating characters in modern history. he was exquisitely smart, funny, brave and had many interests and talents. few historical accounts i've read can match manchester's strong writing, depth of research, authoritativeness and insight."
5,A magnificent effort.,Manchesters biography of WSC is one of the greatest examples of historical biography I have ever read. This first volume effectively captures the age of WSCs upbringing in a way that cannot fail to illuminate and entertain.

1,freedom universal keyboard,"I bought the Freedom Universal keyboard. The installation was very difficult, I has to carefully read the directions, and call technical support. They suggesting installing every thing a second time. Then it started working ... Yeah.I week later is stop working again. I then reinstalled everything and it started working again.This week it stopped working again. I have reinstalled the drivers 5 or 6 time and it still doesn't work. $90 down the drain, and to be honest I loved the keyboard when it was working."
2,Copy protected driver limits usefulness,"My freedom universal keyboard came with copy protected drivers restricted to two users. My wife used one of them. I use my Pocket PC heavily. As my device fills up with files and programs it gets sluggish. To keep my device working smartly, I regularly do a cold reset which returns the machine to its original state. Then I reload only the files and programs I need. Unfortunately, when it comes to my keyboard my two uses have gone.I can see I will be in for a nightmare of sitting on hold with the freedom universal keyboard help desk when I try to put the driver back on my Pocket PC. What will I do when I am traveling overseas?Had I known this, I would have sought another keyboard solution like the Belkin infrared.

4,Love it!,"This stroller is awesome! I can push it with my twins inside over rocks and sand at the beach with no problem! I can push it with ONE HAND! The padding is a little thin and we do have a hard time getting through the doors at the library, but that is it! We still get through the doors! With the front wheel turned sideways we can fold it and put it in the back of our Nissan Quest (older model)with no problem. It's lightweight and the twins love it. It's great and I've been recommending it to everyone I know with multiples or a baby and a little tyke. Definately worth the money - which was affordable by comparison to what we were looking at originally and through Amazon, we got it in 3 days from order to delivery! That was right before Christmas too!"
4,Great Stroller...,"I was a little nervous about buying a stroller online that I had never tested out...but this is a great stroller! It's easy to turn and it's a smooth ride for the kids. My kids loved riding in it. It easily fits into the trunk of my van, and is simple to open and fold up. I just wish there was a little more space underneath for the diaper bag and a parent console...the little water holder bag they give you is pretty worthless. Overall, I would definitely recommend this stroller."
5,Very very please with my order,I was very please with the response time it took for my order to be delivered.
5,Wow,"When I first received Genesis, I had no idea what an extraordinary work it was going to be. I had shied away from poetry for many years, and had forgotten how enjoyable it can be to read an epic poem written by a master story-teller and applied to a marvelous story. Genesis is now on the shelf right next to the other books that I keep handy to re-read every three or four years, trying to pretend that I am reading them for the first time."
2,stream of illogic,There are so many illogical assertions in this book that I gave up on it after a short time. The notes could possibly lead you to something more useful on Lucretia.
2,The Title Says it All!,"Most of what is detailed is for fun and entertainment, however, there was a bitter tone echoed several times when speaking about ""how to handle"" certain signs, usually the Water signs, (which is interesting as I would tend to wonder why the author takes such exception to these signs 'if' they are truly trying to help others to deal with all signs!).Over thirty years professional experience as a counselor has trained me to never ""ignore"" someone's needs because they'll ""get over it"". (I remember the sign, it was Cancer - *shiver* - also the name of a dread disease. These people already have that sign ""assigned"" to them, why give them more grief by being that callous?)Other than that, there are kernels of wit, but, too few and far between to really recommend this as a ""real"" book of Astrology."
4,Very easy and fun read.,"This isn't the bible for astrology, but it definitely adds a few tidbits that are helpful to pack into your existing knowledge. For example, it talks about things to watch out for with your boss- and boy was it helpful. I find the book also presents the extreme nature of someone's personality in a particular sign- so realize that people you know may emulate these character traits to a lesser degree. But it's still a great fyi, because some people are just difficult to figure out."
5,Soilent Green Is Better Than Anyone!!!!!!!!,"I've had this CD for a while but I've just been too damn lazy to write a review for it. Soilent Green has got to be the most innovative grind band that I have heard in a long time. They take elements of grind, rock and some blues riffs that makes for a damn good combination of styles. There isn't a soft spot on this album. The only break you get from the intensity are the intros to Build Fear and Her Unsober Ways which after a few seconds give way to the real meat of the song. Alot of the lyrics deal with sexual violence and extreme hate. The album art is in the art deco style and fits the attitude of the music well. There isnt much more I can say about this album other than it is one of the best albums ever released and I stand behind that comment 100%!!!! Soilent Green will get into your brain and stay there"
1,I'm confused,"I just watched this movie and I have no idea what happened! Thank God I did not purchase it. It would have been a waste of money! ""Consinual Confusion"" indeed! I thought it was just me!"
1,I'M THE SMOKING GUN WITH FINGERPRINTS,"Terrence (Siaka Massaquoi) and Angel (Keena Ferguson) are a married couple who engage in role playing. So there are times you ask yourself what is real and what is set up. They come home one night and Angel gets attack (?) in what was a really poor scene. There marriage goes on the rocks as friends and detectives are called in to fill a movie with talks about relationships, roles, good men, good women, etc. The dialouge was boring and poorly delivered.The drama centers around Angel and her moping and inability to cope with anything. I didn't care for any of the characters.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, rape, sex talk, no nudity."
1,"Horrible,",The actors were below mediocre but thats not the worst part. The movie had about 20 twists to it but no plot? It was probably one of the worst movies i have seen.
3,consinual review,"The movie was ok, the storyline just a bit unbelievable. I wouldnt really recommend buying this one, but I guess it would be worth renting"
1,Nonsense -terrible acting and a meandering plot,"The lead actress has one expression, most of the lines sounded like a vocabulary test that the actors failed.The plot was nonsensical and it was time out of my life I wish I could get black."
3,SOMEWHAT ENTERTAINING,"Not completely disappointing, It offered some plot twist, not very realistic however. I'm glad I rented instead of purchasing. Money saved."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,This was by far the WORST movie I have ever seen! I rented it from Redbox for $1 and that was too much. Why was the entire movie so dark? Did it cost more to film with some light? The plot was dumb and the actors SUCKED! I was all ready to see a good black market film like the Pandora movies or Cover. NOT! My 11 month old son could have done a better job filming this sorry movie! Try again because this was NOT the business!
4,take this tour,"Reminiscent of the great, neglected ""Ceremonial Time,"" this expertly researched and edited volume provides a ingenious portrait of one place -- in this case, the southwest of Ireland -- over a period of centuries. From shipwrecked sailors to invading soldiers, from Victorian missionaries to modern kayakers, ""The Grand Tour"" shows Cork's Beara Peninsula through the eyes of visitors who came, saw and wrote. Unknown voices join with writers such as Shaw, Tennyson, Woolf, Kipling and O'Faolain to describe a land, people and culture that changes only infinitesmally until recently."
4,Its OK,"The headphones work GREAT as headphones. The Noise cancelling portion.. leave more to be desired. I was sitting in a large populated area with them on and turned on the noise canceling portion. The peoples voices got muted VERY LITTLE, and once I started playing my game the music drowned out everyone else. HOWEVER, I also turned off the noise cancelling portion of it and it had the same effect."
3,It's Okay,"These headphones are okay. The sound is excellent, but the noise cancelling function is not as advertised. That was the sole reason for the order, thus these headphones were returned."
2,Noise cancelling? Pshaw....,"I have a pair of Sennheiser noise canceling headphones. When turned on, they do the job nicely, so I know what noise canceling headphones are supposed to do. I got a pair of these ""noise canceling"" headphones as a freebie service award from my company, with the idea that my partner could use them on a 14 hour flight that we're about to take. They look very nice, and appear to be solidly made. The sound quality is reasonable. But noise canceling? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. They don't even reduce the sound of computer running under my desk. We have a pair of $10, old school Sony earmuffs that do a better job of reducing ambient noise."
3,Great phones but broke after close to a year,"I work as a medical transcriptionist and need good quality headphones 8 to 10 hours a day. These definitely fit the bill. Unfortunately the plastic broke and while I've temporarily ""fixed"" it with a small hose clamp the ear piece no longer fits flush on my head and that side is pretty much useless. I expected more than a year's worth of work, but maybe that's all these have in them."
2,Hurts my ears,"I bought these somwwhere other than Amazon, but was not satisfied with the comfort. I wore them about 15 minutes and my ears hurt like heck. The sound is good, but the hurt cancelled that out."
2,Good sound quality and Poor on the noise cancellation.,"I bought this set at Tokyo airport at cost about US$ 65. I had tested during the 13 hours trip in air from Tokyo to Chicago.Overall it was comfortable set with decent sound quality. But the Noice cancellating is not very good. There is barely any difference between the Noise cancellation mode on and off. Honesly it might only cancel 30% of the noise instead of the 75% labled. Only way I can do was to turn up the volumn to cover the flight noise. You can get the same good sound quality earphone with a fraction of price in US marke which does not have the noise cancellation lable. considering the price i paid, I would rate the deal I have is about 2 stars. But if you can get the price at around $30, I will rate the deal to 3 stars.I had tried the Bose set in the AA's business class. It was much much better set than this one here. If you really want to use one in airplan. I will recommend trying somthing better."
2,Good until plastic broke at hinge,"I had these headphones for about a year now and they served me well until today when the headphones broke at the hinge where they fold. I only used these when I traveled which was probably about 20 times, so they really didn't see much abuse. Poor design."
2,Noise canceling???,"This is a true example of getting what you paid for. If you want a true portable noise cancelling product, please consider spending a few bucks more for the Sony MDR-NC40.The good: Comfortable for long hours of use. Acceptable sound quality.The bad: Somewhat bulky to be a portable item. The noise canceling feature is horrible. Just throw away the battery and loose the weight."
3,Not noise cancelling,"As regular headphones, they're OK, as noise cancelling, they're useless. Barely any impact on reducing external noise. Also somewhat fragile, the earpiece on ours broke off after a couple of months--our fault, but not very sturdy construction."
3,decent sound quality,"but not noise cancelling. they do reduce background noise a fair amount, but if you are looking for actual noise cancellation, be prepared to put down a little more money than these cost. for my purposes though, they are good enough."
2,Poor noise reduction,"I have to say the sound quality of the set is good for the price, however noise reduction is poor. I've had several pairs of ""cheap"" noice reduction headphones over the past 8 years, purchased in the $40 - $60 range.These don't cut it for noise reduction. However if noise reduction isn't the primary purpose, these are fine."
1,Don't waste your money,"First off, the noise cancelling feature is non-existent. So know that going in if you are still thinking about purchasing. Compared to the Bose QuietComfort 15 Headphones, these are tin cans. The bass in the JVC is very poor as well. Don't expect your hip hop or electronic music to sound as it should. I would describe the quality of sound as comparable to the free airline headphones you get on a plane. The construction is one step up from airplane quality headphones though. The self coiling feature on the plug is convenient, but feels a bit cheap. As you can tell, there aren't many good features about these. I would definitely try something else. There are way better products out there for this same price."
3,Acceptable headphone performance,"Purchased this product because all ear bud types I have tried do not seem to fit my ears, and do not provide sufficient noise isolation in noisy environments (automobile with passengers, airplanes, Etc.)Frankly, the HANC80's are marginal performers at best. Most of their noise isolation (approximately 2 - 3 dB) is realized from their over the ear design. The active noise cancelling function may gain an additional 1 dB of reduction independent of mode selection. Audio reproduction is on par or slightly better than with other inexpensive earphones/buds."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these to use on a 12 hour plane ride. Unfortunately, the noise cancelling is minimal at best. In fact you have to listed closely to hear a difference. I kept switching them on & off just to detect any differences. Even worse, the sound quality is just plain aweful. Music from my iPod sounded muddled. I ended up using mu VModa ear buds with 100x better results. These were just a waste of money. I recommend spending the additional $$ for a better quality set."
1,ripoff,"A $5 earbud piece from Taiwan does a better job at noise cancelling than this JVC piece. Just how bad is it? I listen to music using the noise cancelling feature while standing next to a 6"" table fan. I can hear the drone of the whisper-quiet fan through the JVC headphone! Steer clear of this worthles piece of equipment."
1,Pay more for something that works,"These are uncomfortable, and do not cancel out much noise at all when on a plane. I will throw them in the trash when I buy a real pair of noise canceling headphones."
4,good for the price,"Nowhere as good as Bose or Audio Technica, but does the job. I used my JVC phones on a recent transatlantic flight and it definitely made a difference in the quality of the flight. I would say that it cuts around 1/2 of the ambient cabin noise, allowing one to listen to music at lower sound levels. The over-the-ear design became quite uncomfortable after several hours, however. If price is no object, skip these phones for some more capable ones, but for around $30, it's worth the money."
3,"Sounds Good, but hurts my Pinna","I was looking for a satisfactory pair of noise-cancelling headphones. The price and features are acceptable. I do like the sound quality very much. The noise cancelling feature is not that great. But the way the headphones fit is mediocre. I use my headphones 8 hours a day for my work, and after a couple of hours, start to hurt one of my ears where it sits. Have tried and tried to adjust to no avail."
2,Sub Par Noise Cancelling,"I bought these for my wife to use so she could listen to music or audiobooks while I watched TV. She complained that even with the noise cancelling on, she could still hear the TV, even at extremely low volumes. The headphones are comfortable enough for on the ear style, but I'd recommend an over the ear version for better comfort. In the end, I am going to spend the extra money and get her a pair of able planet NC110B. Caught them on sale so the difference in price is only 50 dollars. I own a pair of the NC1000s and they work great.Overall, decent sound, poor Noise Cancelling, and you'd probably be better served spending just a little more $ to get a better product."
3,"Not bad, but not for frequent flyers","It does cancel some noise, but not for frequent flyers.I like the sound quality, but have mixed feeling about the noise cancelling part.Pros: Comfort is 100%, sounds 80%Cons: Noise Cancelling is 60%"
3,Good but...,"These are great headphones. Nice sound, with strong bass and detailed treble. Great noise cancelling (not the best, but I think it's part of the design of the headphone). One problem: when I connect them to an iPhone 3GS, it renders my mic useless. Callers can't hear me if I decide to leave them connected. I don't know if this is JVC's or Apple's problem, but it's a major set back to an otherwise great product."
2,Do not buy this.,"I think it should not be called as ""Noise Canceling"" headset because it is not.Sound quality is OK. There is one small button to select ""Wide"" and ""Low"" which do nothing.Its a lower prices product from JVC so, do not expect much from it.Second thing : Seller charge a lot of shipping and restocking fees which cover almost 50% cost for product. Seller is too poor to afford return shipping. If you ever think of returning it, you better do not buy it :)Thanks for reading."
4,"Works great, great value","Not bad for the price around $30. Noise canceling works as advertised (75% noise cancellation). Reason I bought this is because of the price and doesn't have additional compartment for the battery and noise canceling controller ""box"". Noise canceling controller switch and battery is located in the headphone.On the downside, it is a little uncomfortable after about an hour or so of use."
2,you get what you pay for ... i guess,I bought the headphones as a secondary to my bose in-ear headphones. what sold me on the headphones was the noise cancellation ability....i live in nyc and the morning commute is loud and sometimes it's loud to the point that i can't hear my music (i usually turn up the ipod all the way up only to barely be able to hear it). with that said....these headphones did not deliver. the noise cancellation is barely detectable and the over all sound is not as clean as i would expect from the JVC brand. As mentioned the headphone design is poor and makes long wearing sessions impossible.
2,Poor Construction,"Had these for 2 years and 3 transatlantic trips. They worked well until the joint at the headband broke with not much force needed. This plastic part is brittle and this, in the days of cross-linked polymers that are as tough and resilient as leather, is unforgiveable. Then JVC give you an education. The broken knuckle can be removed in 2 minutes and is the only part of the whole assembly than can be replaced, but there are no parts available. JVC says the headphones are ""replaceable"" that is they are throw away.My next headphones will be more sturdily built."
5,Good quality for the money,Light weight can ware for a long time. Sound quality is good and the noise reduction works well. Also folds up for easy carrying
1,Ear Pads make a loud plastic crinking noise,"Ear Pads make a loud plastic crinking noise when turn your head. I am returning them.Hope this helps will try a pair of something else in a store next time. Have many pairs of over ear head phones Bose, Sony, and they all get to hot after a hour or so. Let me know if there is pair thats lightweight and not to hot."
2,Too good to be true?,Was happy to find noise canceling at a great price. Headphones worked fine for a few months before quitting in the middle of a 13 hour flight. Noise canceling was OK but not great when they worked. Returning for a partial refund.
2,Didn't try audio; noise cancelling inadequate,"I ordered these headphones for work; I work in a noisy environment and need to avoid distractions. These headphones are incorrectly categorized as over-the-ear instead of on-the-ear. The cups are only about an inch wide on the inside, the headphones themselves are a bit over 3"" in diameter. They go on the ear, not over the ear. The passive sound reduction is basically non-existent.I turned on the noise-cancelling feature and I like the ""wide"" setting for my use, but the lack of passive sound reduction is a deal-breaker. I'm going to exchange these."
2,A Disappointment,"I agree with several reviewers who have pointed out that these HA NC80 headphones are not very comfortable and provide minimal, if any, noise cancellation.I have owned the JVC HA NC250 noise cancelling headphones for a little over a month. They are very comfortable, provide excellent noise cancellation, and cost a little over 3 times what the NC - 80's cost. But they are well worth it. The difference between these and the NC80's is like night and day.I have also used the Sony MDR-NC60's for several years. These unpleasantly color high frequency sounds when the noise cancelling feature is active. Noice cancellation is OK, but they are bulky and heavy.I bought the NC 80's because I wanted another pair of noise cancellers to keep in the car. I was disapointed to find that they did not do the job, and so will return them. Instead, I will buy another pair of NC250's, which are the best I have ever used."
2,JVC Noise cancelling,"I bought these for about $30. Price is low and feels comfortable, however, the sound quality is below average and noise canceling is not that great. Noise canceling hardly helps while riding a bus, I can't imagine them working well on an airplane. I am planning to get a new more expensive pair. If you can afford buy more expensive pair."
3,Great Price - Average Performance,"I purchased these headphones after reading a glowing review about them. However, I found them to be uncomfortable on my ears after about 15 minutes and the sound quality was good, but not great. My $20 Koss headphones from Radio Shack sound just as good. I didn't think the noise reduction feature was that good either and couldn't tell any difference in the two NC settings that is supposed to be a unique feature of these phones. I have decided that if you want noice reduction, just buy some good over the ear headphones that seal well and that will get the job done for a lot less money. I actually thought the sound was better when the noise reduction was turned off. I'm giving up my quest to find a pair of inexpensive NC headphones that sound like Bose because there aren't any. As the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"" and that's why I will ""bite the bullet"" and drop $300 for the best."
2,Returning for something better...,"This is my 3rd pair of NC headphones. The prior pair was a Sharper Image branded set (around $60 in 2000). I used these JVC HANC80 on a round trip between TX and FL recently. Here are my thoughts:Pros:ComfortableFits and adjusts wellSound (frequency response) is decentFolds and stores to acceptable sizeCons:Noise cancellation is NOT 75%, but more like 40%Cable is rigid (does not comfortably go where you want it to get it out of the way)While they do work somewhat, the infiltrating noise of the plane was enough that I had to turn up my music player (same one I used with the previous pair) a couple more notches to drown it out to the previous level. Thus all in all, I was not satisfied with the amount of noise cancellation, enought to return them. I may try the JVC HANC250 next."
2,Uncomfortable and not as good as others,"I purchased these headphones in anticipation of a couple of long flights for a vacation. I have a pair of Coby CV195 noise-cancelling headphones, but needed another pair for my wife, and these looked good. However, I found them to be lacking. First, they were uncomfortable - the Coby's are large and sit over the ears, while these sit on top of my ears and press in. Second, they did not do nearly as good a job as my Coby's did in blocking out jet noise. Third, the Coby's had a detachable cord, which was nice when I just wanted the noise reduction without wanting to listen to anything else. Finally, about an hour into my last flight, the headphone jack pretty much stopped working. The Coby's were less expensive, more comfortable, and have worked really well for over 3 years. I strongly suggest you check them out."
2,Not worth any investment,"These headphones are comfortable but with sound that is unremarkable and noise cancelingthat is non-existant. I have an old pair of panasonic noise canceling headphones from 8 years ago thathave astounding noise canceling compared to these...Yep, canceling turned on, light on,........noise canceling, non-existant!I have several pair of old cans in the closet that do a much nicer job.If the sound and N.C. measured up to the comfort level....these would be great."
1,Does not cancel any noise whatsoever,"I cannot believe that JVC labels this a noise canceling product. I've tried a variety of noises (bathroom fan, microwave noise, street noise, etc) and none are canceled in any way by this product. I should have known that a $35 product that claims to cancel noise out is too good to be true. Do not waste your time on this product like I did."
1,You Get What You Pay,"Cheaply built (I feel that even inexpensive things can be built well), looks and feels cheap, and to cap it all, on the unit I received, only one speaker works! I suppose the other speaker cancels ALL sound including the music! On a slightly positive note, the included bag is good (and appears to be of a better quality than the speakers)."
1,Reduces noise about 10%,"I bought the JVC phones and the Bose series 2 with the intention of making a comparison. Returned the JVC the next day. Dollar for dollar, the Bose is a better deal, even though they cost 5 times as much as the JVC. Sorry to say, JVC has a flop on its hands."
3,Okay about sums it up,They are cheap and the noise canceling is not the best.The cans are also quite small so whatever noise canceling electronic magic is in the cans is wasted.I wouldn't waste your money and instead go for something a bit better.
3,Nothing to get excited about,"The descriptive word I can muster: adequate. I have a occasional utilitarian need for noise canceling headphones and this pair is the first I've owned. I have not been amazed, though they adequately diminish some droning noise. The ""wide"" setting is the only setting where I can detect any meaningful noise cancelation. I paid about $30, not $300 so I'm not complaining."
2,=Noise Cancelling Useless,Noise cancelling simply does not work. Maybe I received a defective pair but at this price not worth going through the return process.Very disappointing as I've only bought JVC the last 6 years.Go for the extra $30 and buy a better pair.
4,Very fine for the price!,"I've had these headphones for a few weeks. I bought them b/c of the combination of price, foldability, noise-cancellation, good reviews, and a comment that they were good for small head sizes. For me, these are really good. The battery and control for the noise-cancelling feature are in the headset, which I like. They cancel noise better and are more comfortable than some low-end Sony headphones I had previously. I like the foldability. So far, no problems with them. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars because I am fairly inexperienced in judging head-set quality, so I didn't want to go misleadingly overboard."
4,Enjoyable......,"Had a bottle years ago, ran out recently and bought this to refill my collection.after a month.... not my top ten edt of my collection.no wow factor with this edt"
1,Callow Competence,"Ms. Mutter recorded Beethoven's Violin Concerto over twenty years ago when still a teenager, and for some reason she has never replaced this early recording. She performs with an A-student proficiency that never adds up to an interpretation, skillfully negotiating each technical challenge in a commendable but wholly unexciting fashion. Time for a new version, I'd say--but considering how poorly she handles Beethoven's Sonatas in her recent multi-disc release, one wonders if age has brought mastery or degeneration."
5,Great! Great! Great!,"The first recording I ever heard of the Beethoven violin concerto was by Perlman. It too is very good, but my taste in music had not really developed. I thought it was too long and that it was boring. Then I saw this CD yesterday at a used bookstore. I had never heard the triple so I really bought it for that. I listened to it first and it is really great. A combination of Ma and Mutter can't go wrong. But, then I listened to the Violin concerto. If you read the little thing inside the CD Mutter says it's the greates violin concerto, well I don't know about greates but it is incredible. I then went back and listened to Perlmans. Mutter's is better in my oppinion. This is a must buy!"
4,best recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto,"This is the best recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto -- Ithzak Perlman's recording is overly loud, monodynamic, and sluggish, not to say it's horrible of course. However, Anne-Sophie Mutter doesn't play the violin solos as well as she could -- there is, like another reviewer mentioned, an overuse of vibrato. However, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra puts out one of its best performances on this CD.I don't much like the Triple Concerto, so I can't comment on it without bias. However, the Violin Concerto is one of my favorite pieces, and I advise you to add this music to your classical collection. -_-"
2,Superficial.,"I personally did not like the book. The language did not appeal to me---it sounded so utterly flat. The scenes were unrealistic (I would accept exceptional happenings but they must be told vividly). In addition the events were tangled and the heroines' and heroes' feelings so exasperatingly tentative. If you do not like Vicorian priggishness, you probably would not like it. If you do read it, it might give you a stronger sense of appreciation for well-written books. Voilà tout."
2,Take your Chicken Soup with a grain of salt.,"I used to be a great Chicken Soup fan. So was my mother. So we were thrilled when a story she wrote was selected for inclusion in this book. However, in the name of ""editing,"" they added several sentences to the end that changed the entire concept of her story. And reading over this book, I have to wonder if they did that to other stories as well. In many cases, the endings seems to have a different tone than the rest of the work. This experience has really spoiled the Chicken Soup series for me and my family. My mother won't even tell people that she's in the book because she doesn't want anyone she knows to read her story and think that she actually wrote that ending. So, my advice is to be wary of Chicken Soup."
5,Brought out the romantic in my macho man,"Anyone who has a romantic bone in their body will find this book entertaining and sentimental. Allow me to illustrate: my macho, grunting, military boyfriend begrudgingly borrowed my dog-eared copy to read on a cozy afternoon at my house. After approximately ten minutes, he is all teary-eyed and encases me in a huge bear-hug. He has romantic tendencies, but it takes an act of God (or Chicken Soup, apparently) to inspire actions such as this on his part. I find the book interesting, eloquent at times, and generally worthy of a warm, fuzzy glow. It is easy to steal a glance at one or two stories during a few minutes of spare time, and equally easy to read the entire book in one sitting on a rainy afternoon. That is, if you can pry it away from your significant other's grasp. I recommend getting two copies to alleviate this problem."
2,Grain of Salt Review adds Flavor,"The reader who wrote the review about taking Chicken Soup with a grain of salt knows what she is talking about. I also got the feeling that the stories are not fluent in style. As for changing the ending of her mom's story, I find that appalling. I commend her mother's courage to write about such a touching event and I wish to express my disappointment at the publishing company for taking needless editing license."
1,"How many ""love"" stories feature cheaters?",How can a story about Michael Landon be considered Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul? He cheated on his first two wives. The wife who wrote the story was screwing him while he was married with several children! This isn't Chicken Soup - it's poison!Is he excused because he's famous? Tell me you can't find a couple who are actually faithful to each other!! How many other people featured in this book were cheaters?
4,Great Guide,"I just loved the positive, uplifting stories about relationships. You read about too many failed, destructive and disfunctional relationships elsewhere you begin to wonder if happy, loving marriages really do exist. Another book along this vein (and even better, I think) is The RoMANtic's Guide. It has hundreds of personal accounts of couples who are madly in love and what they do to express it. If you liked SHMILY, you'll love this book."
3,Not What I was Hoping For,"My wife and I had a cross country trip planned (driving from Virginia back to Utah) and we wanted to get some stuff to listen to that would be inspiring and help bolster our marriage of 18 years. We haven't had much alone time with four kids. Well, this one sounded good so we bought it. The stories are okay, but most of them seemed to deal with death and losing a loved one. Didn't do us much good at all."
3,MEH on the packaging YAY on complete season,"I cannot stand Sentai Filmworks, and it is very disappointing to know Funimation only has the rights to season 1. Funimation uses thinpacks or dvd cases that have multiple spaces in them... unlike this Sentai set in which it is a SPINDLE with four dvds stacked up. If I wanted a spindle, I could have just bought a package of blank dvds.I have always been meaning to buy the second season, and Amazon had it on sale for 40 dollars RIGHT before release date - I found this much cheaper than buying the half sets and so now I have this instead. For 40 bucks, it is entirely worth it.. 63 dollars is a bit stupid considering how cheap the packaging is.I assume Season 3's collection will have the same crappy spindle type dvd case... and I will only buy that when it is on sale.Sentai Filmworks does not have a dubbed version of Hell Girl which does not bother me because I watch it with subtitles. I don't care much for dubs."
2,Needs Improvement,"First off, tool has great attachments, many uses, a very handy tool to have, BUT... I have been through 2 in 2 years. I've done nothing outside of the intended uses for this tool. The first one I thought I over worked. I had all of the attachments and used it for alot of different jobs (sanding, grinding, cut-off wheels, tile cutting, and of course sheetrock). The second one was used only for sheetrock and a little tile cutting. Still gone!?! A friend of mine has a Roto-zip he used for daily sheetrocking that is nearing 20 yrs. old and is still going strong. These new ones need to be built better, bottom line!"
3,No a substitue for glare-free glass,"I do photography as a hobby and I had the idea to use this product to add a non-glare look to some photos .. I first tried it on a cheap poster with clear plastic over the print ... ruined it .. even with a thin coat the clear plastic became frosted. I then tried it directly on a photo .. with a light, even coat .. it was not bad. This is apparently what the spray was designed for. Finally, I used it to put a very light coat on the glass of a photo frame .. it did not ruin the frame but is is a little less transparent now than I would like. So, in a nutshell, the experiment did not really work for me."
3,Systems Thinking for Dummies,"Overall this is a good effort and a decent introduction to the subject, but it leaves something to be desired in terms of depth. Some of the answers to the excercises are incorrect, so instead of claryfing the concepts they leave the reader confused. I found the notation for the diagrams somewhat simplistic: ok to get an overall idea, confusing if carefully analyzed. For someone who doesn't know anything about systems theory I would recommend this book, but I would also recommend following up with other, less superficial ones."
1,Skewed Perspectives,"I enjoy the general concept of Systems Thinking, however I found this text to be an overly superfical coverage of the topic. Additionally the book seemed unecessarily tainted by the author's political/religious views and the subtle underpinnings of some quasi-new age culture that seeks to rebel for no particular reason.In the end, I threw the book out after reading about 3/4 of the way through. (Maybe not the fairest treatment of the work, but I can't stand to have my time wasted.) I recommend those who are looking to learn more about System Thinking find something that treats the topic more seriously.-Steven"
3,Good read but kind of light,"""Art"" of Systems Thinking was an illuminating book about the abstract concept of systems, and applying it to different practical instances. Overall it was interesting, but I expected it to be more mathematical and rigorous, instead of being more psychology based."
4,It is the fundamental approach to Systems Thinking,"This book got me into systems theory in a basic and safe manner without the jargon, the phylosophical mumbo-jumbo or esoteric theories, it accomplishes what the authors goal was, a practical no-nonsense guide for inmediate applications.If you are new or have been confused by other approaches then you will be in goods hands with this book"
4,LIKE IT HOT,"GOOD PRODUCT. MY WIFE WANTED THEM FOR HER YOGA ROOM. YA KNOW, TO HEAT IT UP. WE BOUGHT 2 OF THESE HEATERS AND MOUNTED THEM ON OPPOSITE WALLS. THEY WORK WELL BUT CAN'T USE THEM BOTH ON LEVEL 3 BECAUSE THE POWER THEY PULL TRIPS THE BREAKER. OTHER THAN THAT THEY WORK WELL."
5,Very good units,I am using these heaters in my garage. I have a three car garage and I have two heaters on opposite corners. I have a wallboard heater controller rated at 3600w controlling 2 outlets with these heaters plugged into the outlets (Only these heaters can be plugged into the outlets). With insulation on all walls and doors and the temp controller set to 60f the units have no problems keeping the garage comfortable all winter. Very nice units.
1,Not Made In USA,"I purchased this product believing that it was made in the USA, (because that is what it says in the Amazon description). I am returning it."
5,Very good book.,"I thought that THE NEUTRINO EFFECT was a very good book. The dynamic characters and the many plot twists left me wanting to read more. Also it was pretty neat how the author made the one transmission to outer space have so many different repercussions for all of the members of the team. I especially liked Dennis and Lindsay. They seemed to add a more "" down to earth"" flare to the book and the problems they faced made them more real. Also I get a real sense of what the characters are like through the way they handle the same problem in so many different ways. Over all I think that this book will be a best seller!"
2,"Save your money, buy the first one.","In as short a review as possible... This game is identical to the original. The only difference is that you are playing different missions. I have noticed no real changes in the technology used to make the game or the game play. You might as well buy the original for half the price. If you already have it, e-mail UbiSoft and ask them why this wasn't an expansion pack for $20."
3,Most difficult of first 3 games by far if you maximize difficulty setting,I played this and the original Splinter Cell on hard and Chaos Theory on Expert which changes my impression quite a bit. In the first Splinter Cell there was usually more than one way to move forward with only one of them being easy. In this game there is usually only one way to move forward that is even possible. One place I got stuck was when I was being shot at from rooftops. Had to restart the level and shoot someone in the head who was unarmed in order to get past the ending of the level. It feels icky. This game was too hard to be much fun.
2,I can't take it anymore,"I'm on the second mission and I'm bored to death. It must be a training mission still, but the gameplay is ULTRA linear. I'm not having any fun at all. I haven't been allowed to use my gun at all yet. I had MUCH more fun with the rainbow six series. I've played through at least 4 of those. This game feels like I'm just doing what the game tells me to do."
3,"Fun, Short","PD expands on SC1's exciting gameplay, but if you're expecting a game as long or engrossing as the original, it'll be a little dissapointing. It can be said that the shorter single player experience is offset by the groundbreaking multiplayer mode (which is a great game in its own right), but the game's been out for so long now you might as well get Chaos Theory if that's what you're after."
1,"ZERO, ZILCH, NADA LAPTOP SUPPORT","If you are buying this for your laptop, DON'T. I walked into a retail store and picked up a few games. This one was one that DID NOT MENTION anything about no laptop support on the box. I bought it and opened the box only to read in the instructions INSIDE that it did not support some laptop chipsets. Boy, did my opinion of UBISOFT just go down. I installed it anyways in hopes of still salvaging the software, but was met with a notification that I didn't meet the requirements. Hrumph, big surprise. Nevertheless, it doesn't work on a laptop, so don't buy it if you are in hopes of that."
1,Don't give UBI any of your money!,I think everyone should boycott this company and force them to rethink their bull**** idea that a customer who purchased a legitimate copy of their game cannot run the game because of other virtual drive software on their machine (ie. alcohol 120%). There is no way I will give $50 to this f'd up company.
2,Decent,"The gameplay is good and the graphics are nice but the game itself isn't too impressive. The challenge of figuring out what to do is not a challenge as the answers are usually given to you or made pretty obvious. It's something to do, but not the most entertaining."
1,Never would install.,Never could get this to install even after changing the DVDR drive for a DVDrom drive. UBIsoft needs to get it's act together. It is no good alienating paying customers to stop copying by others. If you pay for a product it should work.
2,Very unimpressed.,"First I'd like to note that the first Splinter Cell was a very enjoyable game. This game has all the aspects of the first one when it comes to unique shading and excellent graphics, however, they didn't do anything new. It was like an add-on pack at best. Also for being such a large game (nearly twice the size of the first one) I would have expected it to be longer. The game is very short, there are many levels with zero body count and the story doesn't really go anywhere. Not to mention there wasn't any new weapons or special moves added. ***SPOILER*** What's worse is you don't even get to kill the two ""bosses"", they're just spy missions!."
4,Great game!,"I have a Sony dru720a dvd rw /xp and this program loaded with little problems. Ths shortcut provided to start the game doesn't work, but there is another one in the program files under Splinter Cell which works every time.Yes this is a linear game but it is very well done and plays through with little frustration and tons of enjoyment. I really didn't expect to much from this title but was pleasantly suprised.Other than the installation hassle, this is a 5 star game"
3,ha cdrw issues i can fix dat,"the game runs fine u just didnt look very hard for cracks try www.crackspider.net and if that dont work spend $10 and get a cheapo cd-rom or better yet use it as an exuse to by a dvd-rom for $20 it runs fine now off my 52x cd-r/rw (no name $10 clearance) on an MSI nforce2 motherboard with a Athlon XP 2000+ through dolby digital optical out, 512mb 2100 ddr ram and running on a 17in princton ultra75e get vid fed through the achilles heal of my system a asus geforce4 ti4200 with the 4x agp bus and 64mb of onboard ram buy download the crack and play on. everyone knows that the game industry hates the burners and wat there doin is not really all that leagal b/c u can make a copy for back up purposes so not to damage the original! eat that ubi soft"
3,"Good game, but stubborn","I got this game as a birthday present the day it came out. At first it didn't work, until I found out I needed a new graphics card. Bought a Radeon 9200 and this game is awesome! The graphics blow your mind and the story is engaging. If you don't like the story, play multiplayer. The multiplayer is as innovative as it is fun. First-person and third-person in the same game. Usually people stick woth one or the other (Unreal Tournament 2004). Overall the game is good. But make sure your card is supported before you buy (or just buy an XBox). Can't give it five stars because of the bugs.Summary: Buying an XBox pays off. But if you're supported, buy PC."
1,Be Careful!!!,"Be careful when you buy this. Your video card has to supprt pixal shading. I bought a DELL less than a year ago and my video card is not good enough. Make sure you check if your card is on the supported video card list. Otherwise, you'll spend 40 bucks on something you can't use."
5,A MUST-HAVE-IT....,"I am looking toward this sequel. I own Rainbows Six 3: Raven Shield and I can't wait the multiplayer option for this game. It's going to be deadly and bloody!!! Those who own Raven Shield knows what I am talking about. However unlike Raven Shield, you have the possibility to make some top notch moves...:).The screenshoot seems that they have changed the view for the multiplayer part to increase the playability. Hopefully they will change also the crosshair which was quite terrible in the first game!!! The story and difficulty of the game should equally be the same."
1,Returned,"I returned this for the armband sold by Sirius, it seems like it fits better then the speck."
4,"Pretty decent, better than I expected","Vocals are interesting, the entire album has an sort of unintentional comedy to it, but that aside, it is rather pleasant to listen to. There are some pretty intricate piano pieces that seem like a strange fusion of Phillip Glass and J.S. Bach, lots of repetition and ostanato as well as some counterpoint and fugue-esque composition. buy it if you are interested in music that changes the way you think about music."
2,"Good concept, but very serious problem","I bought two of these. They would be very useful IF they could actually adhere to the refrigerator shelf. But they don't. First, the suction cups are cheap plastic rather than rubber, and they easily lose suction. Second, when they do adhere, the whole drawer frame easily comes out of the suction cup. Finally, if your refrig shelf has a raised lip around it, the suction cup won't work at all.I may try to to anchor these drawers with Velcro. Otherwise, they're useless."
3,Works well if you have the right size fridge,"I bought two of these for two different shelves. This is a great way to neaten up your fridge, but keep in mind that it needs to fit! I thought the drawers would be a standard size depth to fit any fridge but they're not. Consequently I can only get the suction cups to hold on either the front or the back of the Instant Refrigerator Drawer. I decided on the back and so far after a month they're holding just fine totally full of bottles and jars--I'm just careful not to jerk the drawers out when I need something. All in all it's a good item; I just had to give it only 3 stars because it doesn't perfectly fit, therefore I'm not able to use it to its best potential."
4,Fresh perspective,"Those who think Bruce's music is above interpretation should get over it. Granted many covers of Springsteen songs are drivel, but some interpretations of Bruce's material is enjoyable. For the simple reason that I love Bruce's songs and I love bluegrass music, I love this combination. Call is ""Brucegrass"". In the end one can conclude that it is ok to have Bruce's songs sounding like Tennessee-slick blue-grass, or first rate elevator music, because afterall the musicianship is admittedly great, if a bit sterile. If you love Springsteen, you probably won't mind this collection."
3,Who even has a clue?,"At times, there is a very fine line between pure brilliance and utter blasphemy. Such is this collection. I think Springsteen could be the Whitman of the late Twentieth century, so to hear this collection just cracks me up. I have to let others hear it to get the pure brilliance/idiocy of the tunes. Like many bastardized Shakespeare adaptations, it, at the very least, proves the universality of the original works. Sadly, we miss the best part of the songs...Springsteens words."
3,...!!,"Take it from a die hard fan: this album will provide you many, many laughs! It's a musical masterpiece that elegantly ... all the of passion out of Springsteen's music and effectively morphs it into understated and clever over-produced bluegrass. My favorite moment of this album is during ""Born To Run"". Right at the moment when we are all used to Bruce shouting ""WHOA-OH!"", these guys play the most laid-back blues slide you've ever heard. I near wet myself the first time I heard it. This is one of those rare collections of music that manages to walk the fine line between elevator music and masterful American musicianship."
1,"well, I only listened to the samples but...",This is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I was just looking on the internet for various Springsteen albums and I came upon this. I was completely suprised when I saw Springsteen described as bluegrass and when I listened tothe samples I started hysterically laughing. This is better than an episode of Seinfeld.
3,Item misrepresented,"This product was advertised stating base and 110V transformer for Pelican flashlight. When I received the prouduct, there was no 110V transformer included. I tried unsucessfully to have one sent to me...but apparently Amazon does not even carry the transformer. I was told to purchase the 110V transformer from another vendor outside of Amazon and would be reimbursed. Sadly to say I still have not been reimbursed by Amazon!"
2,squirel bird feeder,"This bird feeder looked liked the solution to our problem with the squirrels, unfortunatley it is also the solution to the birds we have had the feeder up for a month, and the birds cannot figure out how to enter it, they stand on it, sit on the pole it is hanging on, but cannot get into it. Very disappointed, but it does keep the squirels off."
2,not the best!!!,"this Perky pet squirrel proof feeder, I suppose did stop them getting at the food while it was hanging. but I watched them jump up and down on it until the feeder fell apart, falling to the ground. I had to glue it together and then they did it again. The top does not stay clipped on. I saw no birds on it at all, all I did was attract squirrels... I now have all the squirrels in my neighborhood in my garden. waste of money.. sorry!!"
2,not so great,I had to get this twice. Both times the plastic shaft was cracked.The birds never seem to find the seeds until I removed the shelter part. The squirrel proof worked fine - squirrels didn't seem to get to the seeds. I tried for inexpensive and that is what I got.
5,GREAT bird feeder!,This is by far the best designed bird feeder available. It protects the birdseed from rain and snow and the birds can eat in comfort without fear. Squirrels do not get in as it has a base that will close when anything heavy tries to eat. Love it!
2,no Squirrels? Really? NOT!!,"Feeder hung for 2 weeks, NO Birds!! One squirrel knocked it off the tree, broke the feeder, and down the tubes with this purchase. THANKS!! DO NOT BOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GGQ8DQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Bird Feeder,"The first delivery was damaged when it arrived. Amazon were very good about it and said they would deliver another right away and to not bother to return the damaged item as they would have no use for it. Shortly thereafter I received a note to the effec that because I had not returned the item, I would be charged twice. Another phone call to Amazon sorted that out (at least so far).We have not yet used the feeder. It is certainly ingenious and cleverly designed but appears flimsy. Time will tell if it is worth the $30 or not."
5,inner voices,"On a recent trip through the stunning national parks Arizona, Utah and Nevada as well as Navajo Nations incredible Monument ValleyI heard this beautiful music by R. Carlos Nakai - Inner Voices.I recommend this as a great stress reliever in our too busy world."
3,Older songs set to new music,"A nice CD by an artist who does not ""walk the walk."" His music is so beautiful and speaks to the soul, however, his personality is anything but. Had the (mis) fortune of meeting him after a concert and he was disrespectful, impolite, discourteous and nasty. If you love this kind of music and want to support a wonderful artist, go with Kevin Locke. Kevin is a Baha'i and a wonderful person and artist."
1,Bush Junta a Horrible Book!,This book was not only hard to decipher but the drawings added nothing to it's verbal lack of appeal. Who would want to read that garbage!
2,nothin much here,"This is like the other cambridge companions: it is not a reference work, is not thorough, is not authoritative nor objective. This is a collection of essays tending toward the highly speculative, each around 50 pages in length. They range from the silly to the ok, and none are very impressive. The cambridge companion series is misleadingly titled. They cater to narrow interests, not to the general public. Students who need a basic understanding of Nietzsche before they start delving into special topics will find almost no assistance here. Most of the material is of the professorial, specialized, not-generally-interesting variety."
5,A fantastic musical,"THE ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT: is a fanatically clever musical It actually may have a better collection of songs than Stop the World. When listening to this cd, you can hear what truly special entertainer Newley was. When he approached a role, he became it. This CD is a breath of fresh air, and is truly markedly better than the despondent ""art has to be painful and about death"" musicals receiving ""rave"" reviews today. If you want to hear what Broadway is supposed to be, and have a great time doing it, this CD is for you."
5,A Classic,"The CD came as promised and in excellent condition. The music seems as fresh as when I first heard it in the 60""s! I wish there were a video of the performance. Anthony Newley and Cyril Richard were masters who richly deserved their reputations."
4,Pretty good story.,Dancougar has always been one of the best robot cartoons in my eyes--the characters are attractive and the conflicts among them are really the greatest part of this story. It's not the formula we've all seen a lot--the bad guys appear and the heroes beat them up and that's it. It's not the point. The good thing is you feel like you're growing up with the characters and you feel their struggling too.
3,Problems Lurk for those with Non-Conservatory backgrounds,"While I applaud the analysis method, based on Jan la Rue's ""Five Parameters of Music"" (here expanded to nine phenomena), this text poses several problems for the standard college classroom. An anthology is mandatory, though no one anthology seems to work with it. The analysis method itself yields a very densely marked score, with code observations which are more confusing than helpful. As to the standard terminology regarding binary, ternary, and compound forms, the wording is off-putting, requiring a good bit of translation from the professor. While form is a difficult bird for some, I was willing to take time to translate and go the extra mile. I also made use of the examples in the text at the keyboard. I have a doctorate in performance. Heaven help a clarinetist-professor.Very difficult excertps.Three years and out it goes."
2,Analysing music doesn't need to be this dry.,"If you want to learn about forms and modulations, and aren't really concerned about anything else then this book is great. Concise, accurate and well organized. If you don't think that form is more important than content, or if you're looking for an in depth discussion of how musical forms operate (instead of just descriptions) then this book misses the point entierly. Prepare for tedious and ultimately misguided generalizations. Music is much more interesting than this."
2,Errors and omissions hurt,"While this book is a great deal of fun, and does contain some accurate information, it is riddled with errors and omissions, making it a poor choice for anyone who really does want to ""brush up"" the classics."
4,Tommy Emmanual live at Her Majesty's Theatre,Overall very good. I am a guitar player and Heartbreak Hotel and Nine pound Hammer were worth the price of the DVD. American audiences could learn alot from the Aussies. There was not a sound until Tommy finished playing throughout the entire performance.
2,Disappointed,"I purhased two of Tommy's DVD on the same order. First I watched ""Center Stage"" which is an outstanding DVD with a great selection of dazzling instrumentals. Next I watched ""Live at Her Majesty's Theater"" which was a great disappointment. As others have noted there are too many songs and the tune selection does not compare to ""Center Stage"". I found myself skipping ahead after listening to 30 seconds of a track. I doubt that I will watch it a second time and I am a Tommy Emmanuel fan."
3,At least it was inexpensive,"I really wanted to like this book, as another of this author's books launched my culinary life (an overpriced Ebelskivers cookbook). The central idea is compelling: easy to cook and impressive-looking dishes.But it just didn't click for me. Not one of the recipes said ""try me."" The author, trying to be encouraging, perhaps, just seems a bit pompous.I suppose after posting this I'll pull the book out and try one recipe on for size. If so, I'll post my results as an amendment.P.S. The pictures are great."
3,Something rubbed me the wrong way...,"...about this book. While I cannot begin to imagine the horrors Lauren has experienced and I wish her and her family the best,I was left a little cold by the contents of some of Greg's missives. There are frequent references throughout the book to Lauren's beauty, and the reader is left with the feeling that it's Greg who is more dissappointed with Lauren's swollen face and missing hair than she is. Also -- Greg spent quite a few nights playing bass with his band at local bars while his wife lay in her hospital bed. Who was home with baby Tyler each and every night? Lauren's parents, who receive little in the book in the way of thanks. They're the true heroes of this story."
3,Very touching,"A true testiment of love. Greg Manning stood by his wife Lauren's side as she was an innocent victim of September 11th. Lauren was entering the WTC as a fireball of jet fuel engulfed her, pushing her out of the building, thereby saving her life, but not before it burned her 82.5%. Usually the survival rate is very low the higher percentage of the burn. Greg Manning, continued to raise their child Tyler and never let a day (90 total) go by the he was not at the hospital. This is a book of e mails Greg sent to his friends and family from almost start to finish about the tragedy and Laurens progress. He hardly misses a day from September 19th until December 18, 2001. Laurens strength is inspiring. Gregs love is heartfelt. He never lost faith, signing every e mail no matter what Laurens condition was at the time, Love, Greg and Lauren. A good read."
1,Poorly written and tedious,"First, I know that these are real people and I don't want to say negative things about them because it's obvious that they have been terribly harmed by their experience. However, were it not for the connection to Sept. 11, there would be little reason for this book to exist. While I'm sure these emails were interesting and informative to friends and family, they are really very tedious. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the financial situation of the family made it difficult to relate to them - stories about birthday parties filled with nannies and hired companions did not make me feel sympathy for the family. It made me wonder what happened to those people who weren't lucky enough to be rich in addition to being victims of terror."
1,"It pains me to say it, but this book is DULL",I have never returned a book to a bookstore until I purchased this one. I truly hope Lauren is experiencing health and happiness but this was one of the most boring reads upon which I have ever embarked.
3,flimsier than I expected,"I'm a little disappointed with these - they are pretty thin. Too thin even to slip on without pulling the backs up. I was hoping for something I could slip on and off easily, as we don't wear outside shoes in our home."
5,two generations love it,"I am 33 and have only saved a handfull of books from my childhood. ""Owl at Home"" is one of them and by far my favorite, then and now. I love reading it to my three year old and I hope that she will save it for her children. The whimsical antics of Owl match the silly atmosphere in our home and encourage original thinking."
5,Owl at home,Five star it was an easy read and kept interest of child really enjoyed the storyAnd relaxation and time spent with child
5,Owl was Absent When They Passed Out Brains but He Makes Up for it with his Big Heart,"Arnold Lobel is a genius when it comes to writing children's books. I don't know how he gets into their little brains but his offbeat stories always tickle their funny bones.We have enjoyed many of his books over the years,Frog and Toad Are Friends (I Can Read Book 2),The Frog and Toad Treasury,Mouse Soupand many others.Owl was evidently not in line when they passed out brains but we love him dearly none-the-less. There are four stories included all of which make Owl out to be just a little slow in the common sense department. Like when he lets the winter in for a visit and gets mad when it deposits snow inside and freezes his soup. Then there is the time when he scares himself by watching the two ""lumps"" under the covers of his bed.A very fun book to read to kids of many ages and a recommended beginner reader book."
4,cute book,this is a cute book for preschoolers. it puts a twist on ordinary things. i bought it for 4 year old neighbor who noticed the moon seemed to move from his yard to my yard and back. his mom liked the story of the 2 bumps that appeared in owl's bed everytime he laid under the covers.
3,Owl at Home by Arnold Lobel,"Good easy reader with five separate stories about the same character. Pictures are cute and imaginative and help with the story line. The stories seem a bit silly to me. That owl isn't very wise. However, he is a likable character, and at age 70 I certainly can't claim to have a primary grade sense of humor. I confess that I bought the book to go along with a couple of toy owls that I wanted to gift."
2,"I love most Arnold Lobel books, but this one not so much.","At this point I have read every Frog and Toad book so often, I know most of them by heart and my daughter can practically recite them (which is adorable, but also a bit tedious). So I took a look through the rest of the Lobel oevre, and found the excellent Mouse Tails ... and this. I don't know what is so offputting about this book -- maybe that the owl lives alone? He comes off like an agoraphobic shut-in with some kind of learning disorder, and the whole book feels claustrophobic and weird. I swear, I read this once and stuck it in the back of the bookshelf. Hey, they can't all be home runs."
5,best of the best,"this is the best thing i have ever had,better than chanel,paco raban and the others,and this is very rare fragnance"
5,"Kenneth Cole ""Signature"" cologne","This item was a birthday gift for my best friend, who ran out of Signature, which I had given him originally! He enjoys the fragance!"
4,"Good robot mode, aside from small issues...","I mainly got Mirage to help fill out my Autobot shelf, which I feel has some of the best figures in the Classics/Universe/Generations line. I wasn't crazy about this figure when looking at reviews online, but after some time transforming and posing him, he's actually pretty decent. There are some problems: the scoop at the front hinders tire clearance and looks awkward as a weapon; his head is super tiny and doesn't have much movement clearance; he has a rubsign on his leg instead of a proper logo on his roof/chest. I think the positives outweigh them though, as he has a distinct look in robot mode and I like his paint job and stickers as well as his transparent blue cockpit. The main draw is in his articulation, which is extensive and lets him pull off some cool poses. If they had scaled him down a bit he would fit in great with the Revoltech figures, but as it stands he still makes a good addition to the Classics Autobot team."
5,Great natural alternative,An awesome butt balm! Perfect for sensitive skin. An all natural alternative to the yucky petroleum based products out there.
3,good for preventing,I like this lotion generally. It has a good smell and works great for preventing diaper rash however it does not work too well for treating it.
5,40% Zinc Oxide,"I was looking for the info and finally got the answer. This diaper ointmnet has 40% zinc oxide inside, which helps a lot to hel diaper rashes."
5,great diaper cream,This is the best diaper cream. It is thick and helps keep my baby free of diaper rash. I highly recommend this product
5,AMAZING product !,"this product saved me !!!i had pupp rash when i was pregnant and this thing was a saver.....the only thing that helped me !now that i have a baby, that's the only diaper cream i trust !"
4,Great Stuff!,"I just hate the smell of Desitin so I was so happy when I found this cream! It doesn't have that harsh ""mediciney"" odor but smells natural. Not only does it smell good, it does a great job at preventing diaper rash and the price is right! We were so used to not worrying about diaper rash, we got a little lazy with applying it with each diaper change...so of course our little one came down with a rash! This cream is not good at treating an existing rash but is definitely great if you use it on the regular. I look forward to trying out the other Baby Bee products."
5,This Cream is the Best! Don't Bother with the others.,"I recieved a small gift bag of Burt Bees baby product from a neighbor when I was expecting my son. I had never heard of it before and so kept it on the side ""Just in case"". Well I used Balmex and others and was always having trouble controling a rash once it started eventhough I kept my child clean and frequently changed. Well, one day I ran out of ointment at the worst time and so I used the Burt Bees ointment. OH MY GOD! It not only calmed my baby down and made him comfortable but the rash was gone in under 24 hours. I will now use nothing else for my child. Yes true it does cost a little more than some other ointments, but in the long run, I truly began saving money because this stuff lasts longer than the others and being as it works so well you will have to use it less often. In my experience, I blew much more money on the other brands and they did not do as they claimed for my child."
5,"Good Smell, No Irritation, Natural","Really nice ointment. My baby hasn't ever really gotten diaper rash, but when his bum gets a little red and tender looking, I put this on, and it seems to help. Smells nice without being overpowering. Good consistency. I would get just this 3 oz. ointment and forego the gift set. It is the most practical and useful item."
3,GREAT PRODUCT-- DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR,"If you are ordering more than 1 unit, you have to pay shipping PER unit"
2,WHITE,"This stuff is nearly impossible to clean from your hands. Think zinc sunscreen, but thicker...I intended to use this for psoriasis (probably naive), but it'll just get all over my clothes. So, I'm tossing it."
1,bad,My baby is allergic to this product. The smell stink. The color is too white. I have to pay the shipping fee.
3,Great cream but lousy packaging,"I have really tried to like this product. I like the fact that its all natural, love the smell, and I actually think it works quite well. But the packaging is pretty lousy, so I find that I never really for this cream. Its a thick product, which is good, but its really hard to squeeze out of this tube. And as other reviews mentioned, once you get to the bottom third, you really have a hard time getting it out of the package and always feel like you are leaving a lot of it to waste. Plus I think they need to make larger tubes so you don't waste so much packaging material. I think I'm going to go back to Triple Paste, much as I tried to switch to Burts."
5,Super diaper cream,"This diaper cream has worked great for my baby. It protects him very well--if he is even a bit red, a dab of this clears it right up. It also smells great and thus my daycare uses it alot too."
2,Not good for cloth!,"I was happy to switch to Burt's Bees from Cal baby, because it was cheaper and worked well. It doesn't spread as well though, it's much harder. But even with using a liner every single time, after a few months of use, the diapers were showing the white streaks of the cream and the absorbency went way down, to the point of leaking several times a day. Sorry to switch back to Cal baby, but necessary!"
5,Natural Ingredients AND it works better than generic ointments,I bought thisDiaper Ointmentbecause I wanted to be able to recognize all of the ingredients in the skin care products for my 9-month old while avoiding petroleum-based products and pthalates. I was overjoyed to realize that I could pronounce all of the items on the ingredient list AND it cleared up my daughter's chronic rash in 2 days. The scent is a rosemary/pine and is preferable to the medicinal scent of Desitin.
3,Good but impossible to clean off!,This diaper cream is great - very thick and creamy. The only problem is I can't wash it off my poor baby's bum in the tub!
3,OK but stick with high amount of zinc,I have used this product but found it did not stay put and also did not have a high amount of the zinc oxide to protect my son's bottom. I recommend plain old Desitin or A&D.
1,I wanted to like it...,"I received this along with the baby powder. I used the powder with no issues and I also purchased Burt's Bees Bath and Shampoo and have not had any issues. The shampoo/body wash works great and smells pleasantly like honey. No reactions or allergies. However, when I used Burt's Bees Baby Bee Diaper Ointment on my baby I found it greasy, sticky, and very odoriferous. My baby did not seem to mind, so I continued to use it.After several applications I noticed that her minor rash was becoming more and more angry. Having not changed her diet and she was not having diarrhea, I could not account for the worsening of her rash. I stopped using the ointment and started using A&D.; Her rash cleared up in a day.I would not recommend this."
1,Extremely Fragrant!,"Not a fan - I found the smell of this diaper ointment to be far too strong for my liking.Granted, I'm not too partial to baby products with added fragrance, but this one was particularly offensive. Don't get me wrong - I love the smell of lavender - just not on my kid's butt.For what it's worth, I really likeAveeno Baby Diaper Rash Cream, Fragrance Free, 3.7-Ounce Tube- fragrance free, and not a hint of diaper rash on my little man's bottom in 3 months of using it."
1,Don't use this on your baby!,Don't use this on your baby. We used it on a newborn and 6 hours of crying ensued. After a trip to the ER and the baby checked out fine it was determined that it had to be the diaper cream. It smells strongly of menthol. Lesson learned to stay with the tried and true Desitin or Boudreauxs. Very sad for a newborn and first time mother to have to endure. Burts should stay with what they know. The best part is that it was a gift and no cost (except the ER bill) and it's now in the trash compactor.
5,Amazing choral performances,"I concur with the previous reviewer. Accentus has surpassed all their previous releases here. In particular, the performance of the Mahler Adagietto (from Symphony No. 5) is heart-rending and technically astonishing, as solo sopranos and mezzos take on the lines of different strings. There is not a bad cut in the lot, though the Barber Agnus Dei is becoming one of the most overrecorded pieces in the catalog. The recorded sound is clearest when one plays the CD at moderate volume. There is, with only one or two exceptions, no loss of dynamic range. While I noticed some roll-off distortion during a few forte passages, reducing the volume minimizes the problem. Naive has one of the most daring and consistently tasteful catalogues in the business, and this Accentus album is a great introduction to the label, and to a choir that has created the most distinctive technique of any I've heard in my lifetime."
2,Here's the story...,"This book is ""An official Tiger Beat publication"". So, that should tell you right there that this is a book for kids. This is not an adaptation of any episode of the TV series, it's an original story. The Bradys go on vacation to Mystery Island (an island off the coast of Maine), and get mixed up in a mystery (of the Scooby Doo variety). Are the Bradys really being haunted by pirate ghosts, or is somebody just trying to scare them off? What do you think? This book is about as good as you would expect it to be. Although a few times a Brady will say or do something that seems out of character. But it's not like the Bradys had well defined characters in the first place."
2,Not So Good,"I suppose it had to happen sooner or later. I was disappointed by a Biscuit book! The art is just as endearing as in previous volumes but the story really misses the mark.In previous special event flap books, we see Biscuit and the Girl-in-purple-sneakers experience holidays and events from a child's perspective. But each manages to say something about how a child experiences the event/holiday. But in this one, there is no information about what is going on other than it is a graduation. After reading it to my kids I had to explain what went on and what graduations are. Still, they liked the pictures and Biscuit was a cute as ever but personally I felt the author could have filled in a few of the gaps."
2,There are better homeschool books,"I just spent several minutes paging through this book to find out which States worked on the ""Honor System"" for homeschool parents. I knew I had read about it somewhere in THE RIGHT CHOICE but without an index I never found an answer my question. That experience was typical of the troubles I found with this book. Overall it was a hard book to follow because its thrust was American public schools vs homeschooling not any classroom education vs homeschooling. It included very little about the nuts and bolts of homeschooling and what advice it did include was strange. For instance, on Page 208 it says ""If you have only one child, you should have a few more if at all possible.""Also, THE RIGHT CHOICE was so full of advertisements for the author's legal services that his point of view was compromised."
2,Homophobic and sleazy,"I read this book originally when it came out 1980. I was in high school and was curious but I should have known what to expect when they mention one gay main character as ""loving the wrong sex""! But it's OK cause he turns str8 at the end! If this had been written in 1950s or 1960s I could understand it...but in a 1980 book? No. The other characters are familar and the various outcomes are insultingly obvious. It IS well-written (that's why I give it two stars) but I can't really recommend this...especially not for gay men."
5,"Creative, imaginative, versatile, and fun!!","I disagree with the previous reviewer ""Great toy to play WITH your kid."" We first purchased an ello set for our daughter when she was 3 (nearly 4). She loved it! She is able to play at length with her sets (we have since purchased another), and looks forward to adding to her collection. Her favorite play activity is creating a house or work space and the people to fill them. We will be surprising her with the jungle ello over Hannukah. Indeed, ello is enjoyable and creative enough that we have fun playing with it, too!"
5,Greatest building invention since legos,Ello has taught my 2 1/2 year old how to build things and use her imagination. I know Ello is a great toy because it amuses my daughter for hours and she doesnt need help putting it together like most toys do. I would reccomend this toy to anyone!!
5,Very fun Ello set,"When I first saw Ello, I thought, 'Eew!' When my friends started talking about it I started liking it too. My friend Teresa got a set. It was the Fairytopia Character Builder Set. We had lots of fun making beds, umbrellas, people, furniture and accesories. Ello sets may cost alot, but they're worth it! :)"
3,For a dollar it works miracles,I bought this for a dollar when it was offered from some other vendor through amazon. For that price it can't be beat. I will say it apparently was used or refurbished and poorly packaged. It charges my ipod without issue but every once in a while I get bad static if the ipod is charging and connected to the car radio (this is the exception rather than the norm). For a dollar I'll take it.
3,Nicely made but very loud,I purchased this as one among a number of musical toys/instruments for my kids. It's quite nicely made--handmade in fact--but it's a lot louder than I thought it would be.
3,Super Reader,"Doctor Octopus raids a factory and gives the people there quite a scare.Both Spidey and Venom end up on the trail of some serious arms dealing, via talking to some Russian nogoodniks.Serious, as in mini nuclear weapons. Doc Ock decides he wants to go nuclear on some people for their own good.No-one with Spider super powers thinks this should be allowed."
3,An average cue stick for a fantastic price,"I was a little concerned about buying such cheap equipment for my pool table, but I figured that you couldn't really go wrong for $7. I ordered four of these and the shipping was surprisingly cheap. I can tell the difference between these and my old cue sticks. They're a bit lighter and thicker. One would think this would make them more clumsy and ruin your shots but, for a part-time player like myself, it's not affecting my game at all, and I got used to the weight and size very quickly. If you're a pro or semi-pro player, than you shouldn't be buying $7 cue sticks anyway, but for the part time player that's just looking to have a good time with friends (and maybe do a little hustling) these are not bad sticks."
5,Tight tight tight.,"I only had the single U Know What's Up, but then I listened to the snippets, and said to myself, oh, I have to get his album and I am not disappointed. Donnell's voice is smooth, and the beats are tight. My favorites are of course, U Know What's Up, Alright, All Her Love, Where I Wanna Be, Shorty, Have You Seen Her, Love You Down and the phattest song is This Luv. Wow! What lyrics! And I'm all over the floor when that song plays because the beat is so smooth. The only song I don't like is When I Was Down. I guess this song is Donnell's tribute to the old school stuff...but whatever. Besides that, everything else is good. A very good purchase."
3,HE SOUNDS SO GOOD!,"I HAVE HIS FIRST ABLUM AND I REALLY LIKE THE WHOLE THING.ONCE I HEARD HIS NEW ONE ""YOU KNOW WHATS UP""THAT MAKES ME WANT TO RUN OUT AND GO BUY THE TAPE.I LIKE TO HEAR REAL GOOD DANCE MUSIC THAT YOU CAN JAM TOO. HOPEFULLY WHEN I DO BUY THIS NEW ONE FROM HIM I WILL BE PLEASE."
4,Unique Review,"Well what can I say?Donnel has done it again, with one of the coolests albums of the year I must say.When he comes with lyrics like ""Tell me which way did she go , pretty young thing in a GS4"" you have to give him the praises he deserves.We waited long for this album to drop, but when it did it was worth the wait.The production and composition is top class and everything else is above average also.He has definately proved he can come again like he did in his debut album.All hail Donnel Jones."
3,"Great artist, lots of potential, tedious infantile lyrics","I love Donell Jones. However on this CD there's to much name dropping. Trying to follow the trend of singing about money and jewels and cars and Cristal. It takes so much away from the song and leaves you emotionless. Personally I found it hard to think of him as a serious artist. The songs sound good but lack depth. I want to see him continue and succeed, but lyrically he needs to get serious."
5,Donell Jones cd is sooooooooo good!,"This cd is the bomb! I listen to it all the time. I love all the songs, especially #'s 1,2,3,5,6 and 11. I love smooth R&B and this is definitely it. If you don't have it, GO OUT AND GET IT!!"
3,A decent effort,"I bought this CD for the title track ""Where I Wanna Be."" I love everything about that song, the melody, the lyrics, the mood. I liked ""U Know What's Up"" well enough when it was released last year, but excessive radio rotation made me dislike it.I've only listened to the entire CD straight through once and many of the songs do sound alike. Still, I was satisified with this purchase. Jones strikes me as an artist, not just a singer and his music is really mellow. This is likely to become one of my chilling CDs."
5,Baddest R&B Brutha since ..........................,"Smooth as Butta, ever album since my heart has been fabulous and after hearing him on SOul Train performing his latest two from the forthcoming ""Soul Of A Gemini""? cd which were both off the chain I can't wait until 6/20/06. Might even be his B-Day."
5,Superb,"This album is brilliant. Its an album that you can put on and listen to every song without having to press skip. Includes some classics such as U Know whats up, Shorty, Where i wanna be and All her luv. Shame that Donell Jones doesn't get the recognition his albums deserve because in my opinion he is better than Usher. Lets hope that Journey of a Gemini is as good as his last 3 albums."
3,Boring,"Don't get wrong, this CD is good, but all the tunes sound alike(hence the 3 stars). Mr Jones, on your next CD could you change up the beats a little bit. I was starting to fall asleep on song# 7. A few upbeat songs would make this CD flow better."
3,"Good, but could be better","I bought this album after I got the third one, 'Life Goes On'. Most of the songs are...okay, the only ones I LOVED where 'Where I Wanna Be', 'This Luv', and 'You Know What's Up'. The rest I could take or leave, but the ones I did love were worth buying the album for. Like I said, it's not bad, but it could be more original. 'Life Goes On' isn't any more unique BUT the beats and music compensate. Lyricswise, it's nothing new. I suggest you borrow a friend's copy before you buy either one."
1,one good song,this disc is weak.he is better than Usher.they record for the same label but overall this is a weak disc.i couldn't believe somebody compared his voice to Stevie Wonder&Michael Jackson? that person is Tone-Deaf.he couldn't dream that good to be compared to those Legends.u know what's up is the only good track.
5,This brother knows what good music is!,This is one of best CDs I've heard in a long time. The lyrics combined with Donnells unique beats make this his finest collaboration. I bought this CD in November 99'and I still have it in my CD changer rite now!
5,Even stronger follow up to his debut,"During the ill fated Guy reunion, Teddy Riley was quoted as saying Donell Jones was the only person in R&B really doing something. Mr. Riley was right, because seven years later the album sounds as fresh as it did back when I was a senior in high school. From the opening track U Know What's Up to the closing remix, Mr.Jones takes listeners on a musical journey with no filler."
5,Where This Cd sShould Be,"This CD should be in your at home collection. All of these songs are hot, but Where I Wanna Be has to be one of the best songs that I have heard yet. The lyrics, beats, and most of all the meaning of the song. This is a love ballad for all of those who experienced pain in a first love relationship. They didn't necessarily leave because he/she didn't love or care about the person they broke it off with, but because they were young and needed time to figure things out. This CD, especially this song is HOT. You don't have any music unless you have WHERE I WANNA BE!"
4,Classic,"What can I say, this is my second purchase of this cd. In this day and age of having one hit on a cd. This cd is full of hits! From start to finish, you can relax and flow through the entire album. Recommended highly."
5,"Talented, Artistic, Donnell!","Donnell, had me with the first single ""U Know What's Up"" featuring Left Eye. I was not disappointed with the rest of the tracks especially ""Where I Wanna Be"", ""This Luv"" and ""He Won't Hurt You"". Talented brotha who not only sings, but pens hits for other artists as well.Please, good people, don't just bounce to the beat. Listen to the lyrics too.Peace"
5,There will never be another.....,"Let me begin by saying this album is awesome!!! Never have I listen to an album whre I can play it from Track 1 to the very last Track, and every song is GOOD! His album is an example of how music should be, smooth, soulful, filling. This album is an album you can ride out to, or just chill at home with the lights down low and candles lit. His smooth voice will just makes you forget about time. Definitely a ablum that should be in your collection. If you enjoy music and love music like I do. PURCHASE IT!"
5,MR. JONES,THIS CD U CAN NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS CD. I LOVE THIS. IF U LIKE MR. JONES THEN U GRAUNTREE THAT U WOULD LIKE THIS CD TOO. OUT MOST OF THE CDS I GOT I LIKE THIS ONE THE MOST.JUST THE WAY EVERYTING IS DIFFERENT. MOST PEOPLE SONGS ARE THE SAME BUT NOT HIM HIS MUSCI IS DIFFERENT. GO AND GET IT IF U DONT HAVE IT.
4,Donell Knows What's Up,"For close to a year, Donell Jones' mega-hit, ""What's Up,"" was inescapable on the radio and on music video stations, in a variety of mixes including the two which bookend this seductive album, one of the best of 1999 and still garnering airplay throughout 2000. The reason for ""Where I Wanna Be""'s longevity? Thoughtful, introspective acoustic soul ballads interspersed with au courant tales of drive-by infatuations and funked-up love affairs, marked by serious triangulation issues. Jones comes on like that intriguing and sexy thug-next-door, albeit one with a secret dreamy-eyed romantic streak. He has a marvelous voice, supple, muscular and flexible. He can blow tough and tender simultaneously, an irrestistible blend. The echoes of Stevie Wonder which permeated his debut CD are fading as he finds his own voice and point of view on this addictive set."
5,Touched,Donell Jones cd was off the hook when i heard the song Where i wanna be i knew it was goin to be tight. That song it is so touching it just makes u wanna grab the person u love and never let them go. The video was just as good Donell Jones is a very talented man and i hope he just keeps up the good work. If u aint got the cd go get it NOW!
4,Ghetto Groovin',"I have to admit that I was taken aback by the sexual content, and yet the music and flow of this soft crooner's voice just put me in a melodic trance. I will forgive the materialistic references and get the booty now parts of some of the songs because he give us the Stevie Wonder flow on ""Where I Wanna Be."" That excuses almost anything. I am in agreement with most folks: The best track and I hope the next release is ""This Luv."" Don't ignore the track, ""Pushin'"" it is jazzy and has an old Michael Jackson (When we all liked him) kinda feel to it. Keep up the R&B grooves Donell ~ I'm listening."
4,Great read,"This was one of Laura Kinsale's earlier books, but I had not read it before. It was an excellent book in the Laura Kinsale style - a lot of deep story underlying the romance."
3,Bridget's Review,"Both Faelen and Roderica have their share of secrets. Faelen isn't exactly a gentleman but Roderica finds him fascinating. She has the power to read the thoughts of others, well, except when it comes to Faelen. He is in need of money and it just so happens that Roderica is willing to share hers with him in exchange for marriage.This wasn't one of my favorite books, but it did have some fun elements. I liked that it incorporated a little bit of everything. There were moments when it was downright hilarious and others that were touching."
3,"Good beginning, Disappointing Ending","After reading Flowers From the Storm, I was really expecting a lot from this book. The book started strongly and drew me in....Roddy and Faelen were interesting characters even with all their flaws....The end of this book really blew it for me...the explanation for events and actions in the book was seriously lacking even with magic involved, a lot of things were just left unexplained."
4,Must add to your library,"Another great book by Laura Kinsale with characters to love and a story that captivates. This is one that would easily be re-readable which to me is one of the greatest measures of a books worth. If you want a book you can't put down, grab this one."
5,Unexpectedly blew me away!,"I didn't expect much when I picked this book - although I'd so far read 80% of Laura Kinsale's books and this was one of the final few. The plot they outlined at the back of the book was very badly done in my opinion. I was glad that I disregarded it completely - i just picked it up because it was written by Kinsale. If i'd based it on the back cover, i wouldn't have discovered what an amazing story this is. In typical Kinsale style, the hero is tormented - even more so here .. and the heroine is a beautifully unique character [I personally loved the ESP, magic etc. it did not go overboard]. Definitely recommended, as well as all other Kinsale books especially ""The Hidden Heart"", ""The Shadow & The Star"" and ""Flowers From The Storm""."
4,"Clever, well-written fluff - what I like from a romance.","I bought this book based on the steller recommendations from other amazon readers. I'm hard to please when it comes to romances - I love them, but I'm a literature major and can't stand badly-written books. This one is pretty darn good. Some of the dialouge is so clever and hilarious that you just can't help but be impressed. I actually prefer books like this, where the marriage itself happens earlier on, leaving other things for the plot to center on. This book did a fairly good job with the mystery, but it's a romance first and foremost. Roddy is a great heroine - I never got sick of her or spent the book thinking how stupid she was, as I do with most romance heroines. If you love romances but too often find yourself disgusted by the sloppy, horrific writing or lack of plots in most of them, this is the book for you."
5,love golf,"I frequently change the shafts and heads on my clubs and those of my friends. This is the perfect tool to make this easy to do. It's a great invention, doesn't take up much space on my work bench and the price is very reasonable."
2,Not That Good.,"This product gets the job done, but not out of the box. I had to bend the frame because the rope jumps and gets stuck between the frame and the wheel. Plus, the wheel is warped and wabbles when it is turning. I wish I would have bought another pulley."
3,Acceptance and Denial,Amazon wants to sell to the christian market but this book definitely is not written to promote the faith. It is far more interesting than that. While the story takes place partially in the past it's more remembering past life than time travel. If you read the book you will wrestle with difficult questions.There are opposing points of view here While the nazarene is treated sympathetically as a character different readers will accept or reject his story. The two men in the novel choose differently.i should mention there is some cruel language common for when it was written.This book can be a life changer so beware. As for the series title i must assume that was added to promote the books for a narrow market rather than the broader curious one that used to exist.I recommend Moses by the same author and also Mary both of which will be hard to find.
3,I have read in Portuguese language. Very interesting. Doubts,"I have read this book in portuguese language, translated by a very known brasilian writter, Monteiro Lobato, in its third edition. This book, in portuguese, is very difficult to be found. Only used books can be found to buy. I think that Mr. Asch committed a mistake regarding Mirian of Migdal relatives. If I am not wrong, there was three Mirians. One was Jesus's Mother. The other was the Marta's sister, also Eliezer or Lazaro's sister. And, finally, Mirian of Migdal. Mr. Asch confounds these last two. Anyway, it was very interesting description of Jesus history, mainly for myself because I really believe that we reencarnate every time in order to become a more perfect human being."
5,Incredibly amazing value!!!,"There truly is a household full of bulbs in this box. I had originally just needed to buy an outdoor floodlight to replace the one my neighbor stole when I found this special deal on Amazon. The quality of the bulbs is very good, as good as the GE bulbs I am familiar with. In this box you get 4 100 watt medium base outdoor flood lights, 3 60 watt white vanity bulbs, 3 3-way bulbs, 2 50 watt large recessed lighting bulbs, 8 60 watt soft white standard bulbs, and 4 60 watt candelabra bulbs. In all, thats 24 bulbs, all retail packaged. I am going to keep the flood lights (never know about them neighbors!) and donate the rest to a women's shelter since I use all compact florescent bulbs in the house to save on energy and reduce heat output."
4,Escapism,"The story has the feel of James Clavell's `Noble House' without being a copy or fan fiction in any way. The detail description of Hong Kong in the 1970's comes across as `real' due to the author having lived and worked in the Colony. The story has action, believable characters for the reader to either sympathise with or hate, crafty `baddies' and an exotic location. I enjoyed the story and wanted to know what happened next when I reached the end of the book. The ending didn't leave me hanging and wondering what had happened, because it was the logical place to finish the story, without upsetting the reader, but it didn't stop me wanting more!"
3,It just isn't right,"This is the first episode of Ultraman Great. It is about a two person mission to mars. There One of the people are killed when Ultraman Great and this monster are fighting. Ultraman decides to help the survivor, but the monster, named gudieous goes to earth to either take it over or destroy it. Now the survivor and Ultraman must help UMA (this ultramans task force) fight the gudieous as it mutates normal animals, even fosiles and dead pet lizards. To be honest the show really isn't that bad, but it isn't that great because it just isn't normall Ultraman, rent SuperHuman Samurai instead!"
5,Excellent Flexi Skin Case (Dark Red),"I bought this item about 2 weeks ago and I'm very happy with my Fexi Skin, I was impressed with the fast service. The Flexi Skin fit perfectly as it's the original Blackberry Pearl Cover and is exactly what I was looking for that matches my Red Blackberry Pearl 8110, and the price is extraordinary. Is a must to have if your looking for extra phone protection.. Thank you..RegardsSilvia Garcia"
2,Deceptively targeted and poorly written.,"I knew I was in trouble when even in the first pages the authors never bothered to parse the acronyms that form the subject of this ""Essential"" guide. For example, CORBA and OLE remained useless clusters of letters until much further in the book.My apprehension was confirmed as I delved deeper and the mists of this cute but uselessly-cartooned book grew ever more thick.I've no doubt that these guys know their business. There were more buzzwords flying around in the first few paragraphs than Martians have saucers. Unfortunately, like a few too self-absorbed college profs. I once knew, they don't know how to teach.If you really want an ESSENTIAL guide, grope in the dark a little further for a better explanation. This book won't help very much."
5,Distributed Computing is like Childs Play,"Hi friends, I am an E-commerce consultant in silicon valley , I can say only one thing about this book - This is a terrific book."
5,Renaisance Man - Great,I have just watched this movie on the TV. I can honestly say this touched me. I remember Shakespear from school and pushed me back. I only wish this was on DVD. Devito is great finally coming round to what all must see as a fine portrayal of a teacher caring for his students. I have seen it in other movies yet I can honestly say I was clasping my hands as each 'DD' reached his conclusion on Hamlet. Great movie...
2,Unfunny comedy,"The Bottom Line:A terrible and overlong ""comedy'/inspirational-teacher-film starring a schtick-happy Danny DeVito as a down-at-heel ad man who takes a job teaching Shakespeare to soldiers at boot camp (the movie never really explains why the military needs its soldiers to know Hamlet), Renaissance Man is often laughably bad and never anything more than bearable; rightfully forgotten, it's a movie to actively avoid.2/4"
3,Not That Funny,I was a bit disappointed in this film. It seemed to have excellent reviews here so I rented it. The first half was a total bore. I was about to stop it when it got slightly better. The concept of Danny Devito quoting and teaching Shakespeare was good but something was missing. Maybe it was a stronger story line. I did get a few good laughs in before it ended though.It was also great to see Gregory Hines again. He is greatly missed.
5,I'm impressed,"I like to think that each actor will have at least one movie that I like, such as Jim Carey in The Majestic, or Jack Black in The Holiday. For me, this is the one in which Danny DeVito made that leap. His character grows and that growth as a man and as a father does so matching the motivating forces. I was impressed and the movie was a delight, a delight that I have viewed several times and will undoubtedly watch again."
5,Very satisfied,Very satisfied. Amazaon is the best place to order online. It is safe and easy. Will continue to order here
5,Review,I had a copy and it got lost. This is a replacement for my lost movie. I love the movie Renaissance Man.
1,could have been..better,I was expecting a different kind of film. This movie was so boring even though it had a great cast. Total waste of time and money.
5,great entertainment,"Danny Devito plays the part of a ""drafted"" teacher to a group of disinterested GIs. The interactions of the GIs and the teacher are very real and personal. The teacher carries on inspite of a wide variety of obstacles. Funny, warm and entertaining."
5,Great movie!,"One of my favorites. Great concept, and filled with heart-breaking touch :) My Danny de Vito's favorite!"
3,Renaissance Man movie,"Although we love this movie, there was something wrong with the sound...the volume was too low, and we couldn't turn it up. When I used it in my classroom, it was very difficult for my class to hear...the same thing happened in other classes when teachers borrowed it, and when I tried it at home."
4,funny and good,We 1st saw this movie years ago and we had a copy on vhs.....But as you know that player died many moons ago. So had to get a DVD copy because this movie has a great message for everyone.
2,Weak and One Sided,Would have preferred a biography that spent more time on aspects of Nader's influence and less time on irrelevant details of his upbringing.
5,Excited to see it,"Iv not seen this film yet, but I have ordered it and am very excited to see the life of The man i voted for in 2008 the most important election in history, I just turned in my ballot last week and am proud to say I voted Nader and Im done with this two party corporate tyranny that we have. Even though he wont win its not about that, its about real hope and real change that hopefully will soon be coming, its about voting for who and what you really believe in instead of the lesser of the two evils, they just don't cut it anymore."
5,Nader is great,"I had seen this on public TV, and wanted a copy for my own. To me, Ralph Nader is a real hero, crucified by the money interests and corporations who cannot buy him."
3,Interesting light reading,"I bought this book to help research places to move to. I think the title is misleading as some of the top places were not affordable! I think it's a great book for people that are researching vacation destinations... but if you are looking to move and basing your research on this book... you need to supplement it with others! I also thought they left some other appropriate selections out... so it didn't seem to be as complete as I would have liked. Regardless, it's interesting to see towns grouped together under this umbrella of art town and I did enjoy reading it."
1,Waste of money,"The information in this book is available for free on several websites. Places Rated and Find Your Place will give you much more information for free. I found the information on Minnesota towns to be way outdated and just plain wrong. Save your cash, use the web."
3,Is This Book Very Accurate,"I visited Berea, Kentucky because of this book's description and was very disappointed. The only interesting thing to see was Mitchell Tole's Art Gallery. We spent part of a day there and left. It made me question the validity of the book."
4,Serves my purpose,"I read this book purely as a guide to what good arts communities need to offer. I certainly understand the concerns expressed by other readers in thier reviews, but I found the book generally useful for outlining the elements that foster healthy arts-based tourism. In fact, it seems more useful in this regard than it does as a guide for artists looking for spaces to move to. As a vacation guide and as an outling for understanding what makes artsy communities tick the book works well."
1,Disappointed,"I looked to this book, as reviewed, as a possible guide to moving to a small town. Absolutely, no help! This is an upscale tourist book with all the usual popular information."
3,A Good Starting Point,"Since I'm an artist and I travel many miles to exhibit at Art Festivals, I often refer to this book before a journey to see what interesting towns may be near our route. Some of the places have been gems while others were pretty disappointing. I already had my own list of quaint towns and many were in this book, but some were a real surprise. I think it should be approached from a ""it's a nice place to visit but you couldn't afford to live there"" position. Its a good starting point and hopefully future editions will be more on target."
3,"completely out of date, dont bother","I bought this book last year, and while it may have some good ideas about which towns to go to, the prices of the housing is completely out of date. You cannot buy a house in any of these places for the prices he quotes. Obviously the real estate boom has made this resource obsolete. I wish he would write another book like this, but with up -to -date home prices."
1,Clueless,"A friend of mine and I both recently read this book, and were dismayed at the places it did not include. I live near Kingston, NY, recently named one of the ten best places (of any size) in the US for artists to live, and near Woodstock, NY. Neither was mentioned by Villani. Kingston has become a great town for artists only recently, so the book is merely out of date with respect to Kingston, but Woodstock has been an artists' colony for a century. The air is great in Woodstock; though there is only a little affordable housing there, there is plenty in nearby villages."
2,Small towns for creative souls,"This volume seems to be the only book dedicated to the small art town. Some of the towns listed here aren't that small; Santa Fe, Taos among them. My main complaint is the ones that did not make the list. Perhaps that is good so that they maintain their authenticity. I won't mention Marfa. oops! Other towns in this list are essentially tourist reconstructions of old town centers with a sprinkling of galleries thrown in. Don't expect comprehensive with this book."
1,great read but far from reality,"I thought this book was a good read. Coming from canada we were not aware of all the many so- called arts towns in the usa. I sincerely doubt that the author has done any extensive research on the subject of moving and costs of living. The author also seems to have an extreme left wing bias. We have visited a number of these so- called arts towns. Many of them are either over- priced or in sad shape. I suggest mr. villani stay in the land of disenchantment new mexico, were his leftist , ideological view of the country can remain. Save your money , get it at the library."
1,Short-sighted research,"The city of Fort Myers, FL is disparraged in this book as a menagerie of NASCAR fans and strip clubs. Anyone who's spent time in Fort Myers knows that there aren't many strip clubs and the ones that are here aren't a big part of the local scene (what to do on a random Saturday night) like they are in other parts of Florida, like Tampa, Clearwater, or Miami."
1,thanks for the rent increase,"since this book was published, the rents for towns mentioned have increased by an average of 10 percent. could it be that the author owns properties in the towns he citess?"
1,Help ruin a good thing,"Yet another book that seeks out unique places to live, encourages people to move to them, therby helping to destroy the very things about them that make them special. Why?"
1,For the very young,"Wish this had a much better close up view so I could have seen it in more detail before I bought it. Took a chance and regret it - this is probably useful for 5 and under. After that, you have to get a real map."
3,returning it. one star for the equality.,I just got this map and I am returning it. I'm so disappointed. The description says the map is laminated- It NOT. It's a thick glossy paper. It's a very poor quality and I am not throwing away $38 dollars.
4,"Beautiful, educational map for young children","I simply love this beautiful map! I bought it for my 3 and my 5 year old children. My child does not read yet. I am glad I got this visually simpler map instead of a more adult version with busy words. The cartoon legends on the map make her want to ask and to learn world geography. I place the map on the wall by the entrance to the kitchen. On the way in or out of kitchen, we enjoy lingering and talking about kangaroos in Australia, diamonds in South Africa, pandas in China and so forth. It is sturdy, richly colorful, a wonderful conversation piece with children (added bonus: seven wonders of the world, biomes, cloud formations, planets) Eeboo products are simply a joy to behold."
4,I love this map,"Great map. All our family lives around the globe so I put this above my son's bed so he can see where they are when we have bedtime prayers. It's a great way to teach kids about geography, and to feel close to others though we are far apart. It goes onto the wall very easily and looks very nice. I just have to make sure his one year old sister doesn't tug at it, but it's lasting up there nicely nevertheless."
5,Great detailed map,"We wanted a map to create a Montessori space for our 3.5 year old son. It is colorful, detailed and high quality."
3,Map review.,Nice and sturdy laminated map. Disappointed that there were no attachements or pins to mark landmarks. I expected more details on the map. The price was high for this product.
5,Label it and you'll never forget what it is.,From point to point get the real facts on what it there by a lable. Big and small tells it all.
2,"bad production, just noise","This is a bad album. There is not one song worthwhile listen to.I love ""Tuffer than tuff"", which is great rockabilly. This one surely can't keep upwith it."
1,Blah.,"Nothing new here. Same old... Same old...Now, for sure some will think same old, same old paul simon is just dandy, but the simonschtik is getting tiresome. I listened to this a few times and really wanted to be thrilled but after the third time I never wanted to hear it again. Put it on in the car one night and didn't say anything more than ""Hey, heard the new paul simon?"" Reaction was the same as mine: ""I've heard this all before.""Blah."
1,How sad that such a talent has failed,"I thankfully did not buy this new, and had I paid attention to the overall positive rating here, I might have bought it sooner. I have no idea what these people are talking about who like it--just no idea at all.What sad sad times when one of the greatest poetic songwriters of my generation loses it. Between the time he went solo and Graceland, inclusive, he wrote inspired music. Now, this stuff is not tuneful, it's full of silly religious claptrap, and none of it sticks in my head at all after four times listening through. Maybe it's time for him to retire."
2,Hit&Miss,"Paul Simon is a very talented songwriter&understands the power of Hooks&Melody over the years,but this Album on a whole leaves a lot to be desired.vocally he is in his usual form&the Poet in him is loud&Clear,but alot of these tracks feel like they were thrown together much memorable material is felt here.but I still dig his older material. I just thought he might have some jams,but it wasn't really happening."
2,"Interesting Lyrics, No Music","And that's about all you really need to know. Eno makes a significant contribution to ""How Can You Live in the Northwest"" (the first four measures or so of which come closest to having some actual musical content), but mostly he's just a superfluous noise. I could do without Paul Simon on clangorous electric guitar. I could also do without the wise patriarch pose."
2,"If good lyrics means repeating the same line over and over, then yes, Paul Simon's new album is genius.","There are a few nice little melodies here and there, but overall this cd stinks. It's like a more watered down version of Nickleback. They sing a verse and then basically just repeat it for two or three minutes until they get tired of singing the same verse over and over again. Paul Simon, he makes it seem not as random as Nickleback does, but it's still pretty bad. It sounds better then Nickleback, but that's still not good.How do you live in the Northeast is a horribe song. I understood what it was trying to say, I don't think anyone wouldn't get it if they listened to it. It was a pointless, political song that just kept asking the same questions over and over again. ""Outrageous"" was a good song. It was funny, but it was plagued with the same repetition that most of the tracks seem to suffer from.It's nice and smooth and it goes down easy, but old Paul Simon beats this new stuff anyday."
5,Poetry in pop,Paul Simon continues to write his poetry and set them to pop music. His songs evoke memories of childhood and transform them into philosophies about loving and living.
3,only for true Paul Simon afficionados,"I was actually somewhat disappointed in selections Simon chose for this collection. With the exception of the last track, ""Father and Daughter,"" most of the tracks are very similar - vocals with heavy percussion support and light guitar. Some additional electric instruments were added on some tracks but most of the tunes are not the kind that ""stick with you."""
3,Not bad,"I kind of like Simon and I kind of like Eno. Unsurprisingly, I kind of like this albumn. Two standouts are ""How can you live in the northeast"", both for lyric and music hooks, and ""That's me"", for the music. Eno fans will probably be surprised at how little ""Eno-sound"" is here; Simon fans will probably be surprised at how electronic it is. It's much more Simon than Eno.Worth having; not worth raving over. In general I think it works; diehard Simon fans might disagree. Diehard Eno fans may need to look elsewhere."
3,"good tunes, bad mix","While I enjoyed the music on this CD, the mix is not up to Paul Simons usual standards. The bass is way too hot and distracts from the lyrics. With it's constant bombardment it makes it difficult to enjoy the rest of the feeling Paul is trying to convey.A better mix would make this a very wonderful CD."
5,Even better than Graceland!,"Simon is aging very well. The music and rhythms remain cutting edge and his voice has never sounded better. The lyrics are spiritual, joyful, and reflective of someone who has rounded the corner of mid-life. I listen to this disc ""over and over again. Oh I would not give you false hope!"""
5,Excellent,"Musically this is one of the suprises of the year. Paul Simon delivers a CD with Brian Eno. The music is exceptional. And the musicians present are likewise brilliant (Herbie Hancock, Steve Gadd) This makes the CD indispensable. My only gripe is Paul Simon's Voice which I have allways found somewhat unnerving. Thinking of it this is the first Paul Simon record I like."
5,Great,"Paul is a pioneer who is constantly changing his sound. That being said, this album is totally different from his earlier releases. If you are expecting something along the lines of graceland or there goes rhymin simon then you might be disappointed. Initally I was disheartened by his new sound however the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with this new sound. It is definately a more edgey sound than your typical Paul Simon.Paul Simon is an amazing musician. If you're a Paul Simon fan buy this album with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.I cant wait to see him perform these songs live in July! I love him!"
4,I was!,"Paul Simon is a National Treasure. A genius. He's also 64yrs old,""in the valley of twilight,"" and a brilliant re-inventor, moving in directions that inspire him. Surprise is one of those subtle records. Insidious. The best kind. The running order could have been pulled from a hat. The only track that hasn't gotten me yet is ""Wartime Prayers."" Simon made a great decision in partnering with Brian Eno(described as a ""Sonic Landscaper"" on the record.) Those landscapes make Surprise compelling. Simon's ""twilight"" songs do the rest. They are moving and sentimental, but not morbid. We overuse the term ""artist"" in popular music. Paul Simon is an Artist. Buy this one. Best work since Graceland."
2,Inconsistent and dull album with a good production,"I have been a fan of Paul Simon for a long time. But this album seemed very inconsistent. However the Brian eno production was pretty good.The song seem to be snippets of unfinished longer songs they don't seem to go anywhere. Although there are very good sections such as the poignant ""Another Galaxy"" or the best song Paul has come up with ""Father and Daughter""(this song seems to have been tossed in as an after thought. It does not fit in with the rest of the songs).There are good songs such as Outrageous and Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean but they end with no apparent point as though they needed another verse but there wasn't any time. I tried to like this Album but after listening to it three or four time on my car CD I had to put it up. Maybe I can give it another try but I just cant!"
3,Satisfying Without Engagement,"Paul Simon in his latest disk rides the accompanying sonic landscape of Brian Eno like a surfer so confident of his craft that he can glide without apparent effort--or brilliance. That gives us a result that can be fun and impressive, but seldom startles or deeply engages. In a life marked with many five star efforts, this rises to a three or slightly higher. Fans such as myself will find this enjoyable, but those unaware or unsympathetic will not likely be moved."
2,Hearts & Bones gone electric,"Simon has never released a record like the previous one: his 70's and 80's albums with jazzy, cajun/zideco, reggae rythms were a crescendo that led to the Graceland explossion, which then stabilized with the great The Rythm OFTS and the Capeman (the CD with the Broadway voices is superb). But after You are the One it seems as if Simon has lost its path, and Surprise confirms such point. No more newly rythms from the end of the world, no more catchy lyrics, no more melodies that you can't get out of your head. Surprise would be Hearts and bones with a twist if it weren't for those electric guitars and misplaced music drilling your head. It's as if someone had taken Paul's voice and mixed it with a modern bands's garage rehearsals. Only when Paul is alone with his guitar and original style you start to enjoy it."
2,argument for iPod,"Not that I own one. But I do download individual songs. I am a great admirer of much of Simon's work, and was excited to hear ""Surprise"" on the evening before it's official release. But it turns out to be 2 or 3 fairly good tunes with a bunch of filler (what used to be called ""flip sides"" in the olden days). Very, very little in the way of memorable melodies. Please spare me from the ""soundscape"" or whatever it's called. Truth be told, I'd go for another S&G tour with a nice stint of strong Simon solo material, a la the Central Park concert."
2,Too wordy,"I wanted to like this album, but found that lyrics interfered with, rather than added to, my enjoyment of the songs. Paul Simon has experimented with his music, and I enjoyed some of the album's instrumental sections. Once he starts singing my interest waned. After a few listenings I gave up, and won't be playing it much."
5,A GREAT musical SURPRISE !,"Paul Simon delivers to the audience a new surprising musical work of art. This cd will get awarded with numerous musical nominations within the upcoming year. On this release, Simon, a true musical genius, re-invents his agreeable aura to become musically relevant. However, he does maintain an honest integrity as a gifted lyricist. His group of new compositions rise to the level of future musical classics. There are no low points on this CD. On this release, Simon is in greatest artistic form. His vocals are tender yet demand attention from the audience when delivering the underlying musical messages. If you enjoy intelligent musical projects that can be heard for years to come, then I strongly urge you to purchase this product without any hesitation. The ""Britney bubblegum producers"" could learn a few tricks about what can make a musical recording become a ""classic timeless recording"" by listening carefully to the production of this release."
5,Surprise! It's good!,"I'd never really heard Paul Simon ('cept for the songs from The Capeman) when I picked up the CD in fye. All I knew was that my mom was in love with him. I couldn't help it- I bought it. And it's really, really good! The lyrics are compelling, and the rythym of the songs makes you want to snap your fingers, clap your hands, and tap your toes. Father and Daughter is so sweet, and I love that the echoes is his daughter. How Can You Live in the Northeast is really, really good. I makes you think, especially me, 'cuz half the stuff he's talking about is totally confusing. Like, I'm wearing my fathers old coat? What is that about? Sure Don't Feel Like Love and Outrageous are my favorite songs on the track. They have the best beat, in my opinion, and the coolest lyrics. I recomend this CD to anyone who likes Simon and Garfunkel (uh-duh) or the Beatles, or even if you don't like either, who cares? Give it try. You may be surprised."
1,A bad Paul Simon album....Surprise indeed.,"What sounded like the best news of 2006 for my CD collection is sadly the only Paul Simon album I can't listen to. The first three tracks by Eno are just strange and give the album a disturbing eletronic vibe from the get go. Following these first three tracks you have 8 of the most generic bland singer-songwriter songs I have ever heard in my life. And if that wasn't enough, Paul himself will be sure to tell you that he's ""never been in it for the money"" nevermind those $200 simon and garfunkel tickets. Do yourself a favor and buy the Damien Rice album. Not this time Paul, please drive through."
4,An Album that Should Endure,"How does SURPRISE stack up to earlier Paul Simon album classics? I guess only time will tell. I think it's a fine, thoughtful piece of work. As is his style lately, Simon writes in a non-linear vein, which has frustrated, even turned off former fans. His recent work continues to produce melodies that seem to run all over the place. This is not the Simon of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", or ""The Sounds Of Silence"". There are few ""Top 40"" type songs on SURPRISE, and that has pretty much been the case with Simon since One Trick Pony. But repeated listening reveals musical textures and meanings that peel away to reveal something deeply moving and meaningful to the listener who truly listens. Highly recommended."
3,Not doing what he does best,"""Suprise"" is a good album, and while several people seemed to be disappointed with ""You're the One"" and our ""suprisingly"" happy with this one, I just the opposite. I have loved every one of Simon's albums until this one. I appreciate the fact that he has stepped out of his comfort zone, but the zone he moved into doesn't seem to fit his style.Beyond the music, however, are his lyrics. Unmistakably Paul Simon from beginning to finish. The style of music he decided to use on this album doesn't mesh with his softly understated voice. For music like this there needs to be some volume to the vocals.Had David Gray made this album, it probably would've been great, as is though, it's just alright."
2,Weak,"I'm a Paul Simon fan - I own every single one of his albums. I was disappointed with this. I wanted to hear something new, something different, something unique. Instead I felt that I was listening to music I could hear by putting any one of a number of his most recent albums into the CD player."
5,Kermit's done it again!,Paul Simon has done it again. I'm falling in love with this album a little more each time I listen to it. Highly recommended!
3,What a Surprise,"I'm a BIG Eno fan and I REALLY liked ""You're the One"" so I was surprised when this cd didn't knock me over. It is ok but the songs seem a little flat."
5,Excellent Album- 10/10 ! Too bad Warner Bros. sucks,"Paul Simon has created another masterpiece. His songwriting is flawless. The production and engineering on this album is amazing. Everything about it is perfect. I am eagerly awaiting summer tour anouncements. I assume Warner Bros. wants people to buy the CD as well as pay for itunes downloads for your mp3 player. I doubt the mp3's are allowed to burn to CD either. I can understand people's anger about this issue. Overall, the album is worth it and is the best I have heard in a long time."
3,Oh. OK then.,"Not bad. A little disappointing. Some tracks are pretty good and I've loaded them on the ipod; but not many.It's not Graceland, that's for sure."
2,"Buy another Paul Simon title, ANY other Paul Simon title",Paul Simon the storyteller can still be found in this album.Paul Simon the singer and musician is lost to electronica and apparently silly attempts to sound modern.This is not magical Paul Simon. Almost any other PS album is!Sigh.
2,Surprise indeed,I'm a long-term Simon fan. This CD is a great disappointment as it is chock full of generic sameness. I had trouble remembering a single track because they all seemed to merge.
2,Who's Gonna Love You When Your Hooks Are Gone?,"First Paul McCartney forgot how to write a pop song, now Paul Simon. Maybe it's the name. ""Grooves"" and ""vibes"" abound in this sonically interesting collaboration with Brian Eno, but actual, hummable melodies are few and far between. To be fair, I listened to ""Hearts and Bones"" a few weeks before this came out, and ""Surprise"" kept falling short of my heightened expectations. I should have expected less, after I couldn't get through ""You're the One"" without 3 Red Bulls and ""Songs from the Capeman"" left me with a permanent shrug. It may not be ""fashionable"" to write a catchy pop song in 2006, but if anyone can do it, I thought Paul Simon (and Paul McCartney) could. If we want poetry laid over top of a music bed, we have Bob Dylan and Tom Waits for that."
2,The weakest effort from Simon to date,"This record is a watered down, rehashed version of his previous record, ""You're The One"". That record, while not one of Simon's best efforts, was still an enjoyable listen.On ""Surprise"", Simon's songs meander and offer no real structure. The hooks are lacking; very few memorable melodies. The lyrics are forced, weak and contrived. Brian Eno's production doesn't fit with the material and is often quite silly. Thin grooves, too many synths and novelty sounding production.Too many of the vocal melodies are direct rip offs of ""You're The One"".I am a huge Paul Simon fan and have been for decades. I really wanted to like this record and have given it several listens - but I just don't like it.Not recommended. Simon may just be out of ideas."
5,"Simon & Eno, fresh & new ideas","I think that ""Surprice"" is one of the best records that Simon has recorded in his life.The electronics of Eno brings a new focus to this music, generating a fresh approach to the Simon's world, this is a great SURPRICE for me.There are a couple of songs with Bill Frisell and Herbie Hancock (one and one) * * * * *PLSEASE MR. SIMON THE WORLD NEEDS YOUR ""CONCERT IN THE PARK"" (1991) IN DVD"
1,Save your money,"Download ""Father and Daughter"" and you'll have the only worthwhile track on the album. The rest of it is pure garbage."
3,So what's Art up to?,"A good effort here. Too much is made of Brian Eno helping out on the first three tracks. He should have been employed for the whole album. Anyway, stripped of Ray Phiri and without a third world's rhythm to appropriate, Simon returns to his form, which is serviceable enough. These are good pop tunes. Neil Diamond writes good pop tunes as well.Wonder what Art's doing?"
1,Surprise! This cd sucks!,Borring borring borring!Was lookin for some good drummin' and beats that grooved...not in this cd...save your $$
5,The best childhood book,"I am now 13 years old, and I still listen to this classic tape when I have nightmares at night. When I was little I used to listen to it every single night. I listened to it so much that I almost broke it. If you are a parent looking for a good childhood book for your child I highly recommend it, from firsthand experience of being a child. Thanks"
5,Magical,"I was eight years old. I read the paperback edition of this book every night, cover to cover. The story of the effervescent Plop and the conquering of his fear of the dark is as enduring now as it was when it was first published over 30 years ago.This version is abridged and illustrated from the one that saw me safely to dreamland as a child. No matter. The spirit is preserved and the illustrations are wonderful. Great for any kid with any phobia. A magical book."
4,"Delighful but not ""unabridged""","The CD in English IS abridged. We first discovered Plop on cassette, and it ran 1 hour. This CD runs 20 minutes. It remains a delightful, short bedtime story for my 6 year old who has it memorized, but it IS abridged. I still would love to locate a truly unabridged CD that has the detail of the cassette."
5,very good,"I wear these shoes almost every day. My orthotics fit inside perfectly, and they are easy to walk in, very comfortable"
5,"good, reliable shoe",I have a pair of Propet shoes already and really like them. These Mary Lou shoes are much more fashionable than my other ones.
3,"Super comfy, not real cute","Really a comfortable shoe for when you have to be on your feet all day. But not the cutest shoe. But works for when you need a ""business"" attire look but with a gym shoe function. But please make something cuter :)"
3,A small collection of fairly late Cab Calloway.,"This collection is only so-so. The first six selections are standard Cab Calloway tunes like Minnie the Moocher and Jumpin' Jive: good stuff, but easy to find. The last four are very cheesy late recordings. The liner notes are essentially non-existent, just a list of titles and playing times. Jungle King is listed erroneously as Jungle Swing."
5,great,"cop shoot cop r.i.p. , there is nothing quite like driving around on a crappy rainy day listening to this cd and i mean that in a good way."
1,Not a history book,"It must be nice to be able to put personal opinions and worldview in a book, present them as absolute fact, and sell it as a history book. Hmmm."
2,Biased,"The bias and logical fallacies that began to be evident in book 9 of this series continue in book 10. I find it disturbing that this book would be presented in the classroom as ""fact"" when it is, in reality fraught with ""opinion."" Shameful."
5,Exact part needed,"I was concerned about whether this piece was the right part, but Sunbeam seems to have made this part the same for several generations of their blenders. It fit my blender perfectly and made it usable again."
5,I was very happy to find this replacement part,Purchased on 12/2010. I was very happy to find this to replace my broken piece. Purchased from Bettervac Tool & Appliance Company.
2,An explanation for the murder of Itzhak Rabin.,See the review in The Finanacial times Weekend edition on page v 20-21 Feb 99.
1,Mismatched Info,"for some reason, the product ordered did not work in the HP model I have. After waiting weeks for delivery, I cannot remember the exact process for getting the memory configured, but I know how critical it is to provide the correct model number, etc., so I'm highly disappointed. Also, the number on the item itself doesn't match the number on the box or the number ordered. Further, Amazon reports a 24-7 technical service number for Viking. Try calling it a reasonable time, like Saturday morning around 11:00, and they will tell you they are a M-F 9-5 outfit. Further, 3 attempts to cancel the remaining portion of the order have done nothing but bounce me back to the wrong screens."
2,Highly Influential - but I never bother listening to it now,"This is pretty rudimentary stuff. Aside from a few tracks like the sort-of-reggae ""Police and Thieves,"" these songs sound pretty much the same. Might've gotten another star if it had ""Clash City Rockers."" They would go on to create MUCH better albums like LONDON CALLING and COMBAT ROCK.If you were young and English when this first came out, this album justifiably may have meant a lot to you. Others need only check this out if they are interested in its historical significance. Really, there's so much better music out there. If you are interested in punk rock, go check out something like FRESH FRUIT FOR ROTTING VEGETABLES by the Dead Kennedys (who, funnily enough, have opened shows for the Clash). That album makes THE CLASH sound like monkey grinder music in comparison."

5,A jolly good read,The first book of Gloria's which I have read. I enjoyed it very much although it was heart-wrenching in places. A really good read
5,Weber Performer Grill COVER #9986,"This COVER Fits the Performer charcoal grills perfectly. Be sure you get the model 9986 that is made to fit over the cooking dome. There are other covers that look like they may fit (i.e. model 7455) but you may not be happy.The MODEL 9986 looks nice with the Weber logo and extends almost to the bottom of the unit, protecting the grill for rain..... also, one should not be concerned that a strong wind could cause the cover to blow off...."
4,"Great item, very durable feeling but not great fit.","The grill cover is very nice and thick material, however, it does not have the ""fitted"" look as in the picture. Over all, good product."
2,The Hunter Gives It All Up,"Okay this is by far the most challenging Blondie album that the band put out. It reflects a change in the groups music and personal tastes. Island Of Lost Souls does remind me of The Tide Is High and War Child is also here beating to a new drum. So, what is missing to me is the fire of what once the heart of this group, although The Hunter offers the listner calypso, rock and even jazz (the last track tells a great story)The Hunter is an album that sounds put togethere in haste and reflects that all to well, for an avid fan the extended mix of War Child is a must have as part of this collection"
3,"Not their best, but it grows on you","Yes, it has some songs that I consider ""filler"", but the bottom line is that the best songs (English Boys, War Child, Orchid Club, Island of Lost Souls, Danceway, For Your Eyes Only, The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game) are as good as any of the best ones on other Blondie albums.I'd rate it about 75% great; 25% not so much.In a way, Debbie does sound tired, and the band's playing seems less enthusiastic. The heyday was clearly over.Still, I'd hate to have to do without the best songs.In a way, the song English Boys is a perfect farewell: Debbie asks wistfully: ""Does it feel the same to you?"" as if to say (to all of us) that all good things must come to an end."
4,War Child Makes this Overlooked Album,"The commercial failure of this album has perhaps worked to obscure what is actually a very solid work. This album is eclectic, somewhat along the lines that AUTOAMERICAN and NO EXIT are, with reggae (Island of Lost Souls) and jazz (Hunter Gets Captured by the Game) in the mix. The stand-out song is War Child--an overlooked song I think is one of Blondie's best. Here, Clem Burke on the drums really shines. The extended version of War Child is worth the price of this album alone. Experimental Dragonfly is perhaps an odd favorite of mine. This album will probably resonate more with Blondie fans than casual listeners."
3,Not as bad as you've been told,"At the time of this release, the Blondie band members were feeling the pressure of fame and a contract obligation for one last album and so came The Hunter. This is a strange and moody collection from a band that was mostly known for catchy ""power pop"". Does that mean it's a poor album? Not at all. As a matter of fact, I think the album contains some of the bands most progressive work. Orchid Club is a tribal trip with Debbie's voice noodling all over the song, English Boys is quietly sentimental and Dragonfly is a sci-fi hoot. Other songs try, but suffer by comparison to other Blondie songs, ( Island of Lost Souls and The Beast are The Tide Is High and Rapture light) but he band gives it a go. Is it Parrallel Lines? No. But should it be. The Hunter has it's own distinctive sound and proves (with the rest of the blondie catalogue) that the band was a group of skilled individuals with a flair for musical progression."
3,"Good, But Not Blondie Good","Don't get me wrong, I love this group! But this album is rather scarce in great songs. ""Island Of Lost Souls"" while a good song with a catchy hook, seemed to be trying to replay on the success of ""The Tide Is High"". In fact, almost all the songs on THE HUNTER sem to be ""Tide"" inspired. While I would never discourage anyone from buying a Blondie album, I would say that you should be prepared for less than the usual perfect Blondie songs. This was more the record company's album than the band's album. STILL worth owning!"
5,"Listen to THIS, not the critics","Do me a favor: avoid all the numbskullites who say this one is a come-down from their good stuff. WHAT UTTER AND COMPLETE NONSENSE! This is the logical procession of Blondie, I don't care how it was made, whether the band called the parts in to each other with a helping of attitude or what. It works! Chris and Debbie knew what they were doing, and Jimmy always had something special just waiting. You can even forget ""Island--"", listen to the rest. Listen to ""Danceway"" and ""The Beast"", then tell me this is crap, this is throwaway. Bull----. Fact is, the whole album rocketh like every one before it. Street-smart, scary, and flat-out fun to boot."
1,Sad Mess,Blondie as a band was over before this album was released. This album is nothing but the record companies last grasp at some dough from the fans of what was a great band. This mess should just be forgotten. It is an ugly stain on a their history.
2,When things fell apart.,"Blondie ""The Hunter"" #33 (1982).1982's ""The Hunter"", is Blondie's 6th studio album, and by all accounts their weakest effort. Only ""For Your Only"" and ""Island Of Lost Souls"" #37, keep this from being a total washout. For 17 years this album was their last testimonial, until they reformed for the 1999 album ""No Exit"", which was a step above this effort. * 1/2."
1,broken before I took it out of the box,"Very poor quality...pulled it out of the box and noticed one of the brushes was laying in the bottom of the box. At first, I thought that it was odd that one extra brush is provided as a replacement. Then looked under the vacuum head and saw that a brush was missing and when I put the stray brush into place it became apparent the plastic clip that holds it in place was already broken. Hard to believe those plastic clips could hold up for long after a few uses.In this case, less hassle to just super glue it into place rather than exchange it as a new one would do the same thing in a short amount of time."
2,Poor quality,"The vinyl liner around the perimeter of the base fell off within weeks. The plastic dowel connecting the swivel arm to the base recently broke, after less than a year of ownership and hardly any use. It is now useless, and considering the price I paid (~$25 at a home improvement store), I am not impressed."
2,Works but not 5 star,Item works good but in deeper pools has trouble staying on bottom not enough bristles on it and the bristles seem too short. I used it in our inground pool on deep end it was kindy hard to keep on bottom
3,Vacuum head,Cleans a narrow strip well but is not very wide so takes a long time to cover entire pool. Not bad for cost but will replace with a larger head soon.
3,triangle not so good idea,thought the triangle would make sense for corners..i have ended up using my old pool vacuum head
3,Please advise!!!!!,"Please excuse my ignorance - we're new to this pool-ownership stuff! I purchased this item, but it did not come with a manual or instructions. I have no idea how to use it - do you attach to a garden hose? Does it attach to the filter outlet on the inside of the pool? Do I need a telescoping handle or something to use? We have a 16 foot Intex ultra frame above ground pool and a saltwater filtration system.Thanks for any help you can provide!"
3,my problem,"I'm just ordering my third Poolmaster in three years. The brittle plastic fittings on the top broke on the first two, one after a drop of a couple of feet to the wooden deck. Weights on both came loose and had to be reattached. Other than that the product did a fair job."
3,"Works ok, but could be better","The brushes on the vacuum are not at the place to have this working perfectly.When you push it to vacuum, it does work great.When you pull it to vacuum the other way, it tends to do not stay flat, so it's hard to use this way.fault to the brushes which are not enough close th the edge of the triangle, so they don't keep the triangle flat."
2,you get what you pay for!!,"Very disappointed. Vacuum does not have enough bristles on bottom. Very small cleaning path, took forever to vacuum pool!! Priced and made cheap!!!!"
5,I REALLY LIKE IT!,"This works much better than the rectangular sweeper we had before. It picks up leaves and sediment much better and works from any direction. Also, the price is great too! I just saw the same product at the pool store and they were asking $44.00 for it.As always, Amazon service was great!"
3,Functional but cracked,"Nice shape, great to get into corners and around curves but I need a new one. Got this one last summer and just time, use and weather required duck tape to patch a crack in the plastic. It's just not a sturdy material. It's like those acrlyic cups that you can't put in the dishwasher becasue after many times they will crack. You'd understand if you ever had these kind of cups. Anyway, I'll be shopping for a different model, one that will hopefully last more than one season."
4,Good after dark,"Like the other reviewer I had great results but one problem:After dark they work great. My light switch is beside a window and as long as the sun is up the thing won't work.EDIT 5-26-2008: User error here! The instructions aren't very well worded, but there's a ""light"" setting that actually adjusts the sensitivity for ambient light. Cranked it up and now it works great. No complaints!"
4,The International Tchaikovsky Competition Vol. 3,"This Melodiya CD is a treasure. Atlantov, Marsh, and Obraztova are sensational,and in sensational form. Both Nesterenko and Zajick were vocally a little younger,and it was odd to encounter them this unformed, especially when one knowswhat became of each of them vocally. I amdisappointed that Atlantov and Obraztovanever persued SAMPSON ET DALILA together, as they were both ideally suitedfor these roles. Nina Rautio needs to be discoivered by more people, and hereshe is at the beginning of her career. Conrad Claborne"
3,Dilapidated dust cover,"When this book arrived I was disappointed that the dust cover was barely on the book. It look like some rodents had nibbled on it and was barely on the book. However, the inside of the book was fine with no missing, torn or written on pages."
4,The Rest of the Story - Paul Harvey,The book is all here and still bound together. The pages are quite yellow from age. But I am grateful to have it. Thanks
4,gift product,"I bought this as a gift to a friend, and she loves it, last week she told me that she use it every day, and she will order another one"
5,Tribu,I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. She's wore this perfume for 20 years. She always asks for it as gifts.
5,5 stars? Needs to be 100 stars!,"This album is, in my own humble opinion, the best example of a perfectly matched musical score to a movie, and is probably the best Irish music of its type ever recorded. The sound is, of course, reminiscent of what might have authentically been played in Ireland, Britain, or ""Colonies"" in the 1700's.There is none better than this album. Period."
4,Great edition!,"I've been using this edition of Elizabeth I's collected works out of the library for several years now, and even taught it in two different classes last year. It's an excellent edition, with a great selection of texts and excerpts and a well-organized critical apparatus. The only reason I have given it four stars instead of five is because University of Chicago Press has taken it out of print (hence why it only appears in used editions here) and as a result my students last year found it very difficult to find."
5,Better Suited to 3rd Graders,"The writing in ""Felita"" is easy for 7 year olds to read, but I'm not sure about the topic. This book is about a Puerto Rican girl who's the object of racism, yet survives thanks to the ""love of the family."" While there isn't any sex, profanity, or murder, there is the concern of how much the kids will understand. When they read how the local girls turn on Felita, what will they think? Will they wonder why the girls were suddenly cold to having her in the neighborhood? Will they think that this is what you can expect when you move house?If you give this to a child to read, you have to discuss the book after he/she reads it. There's too much in here that a child may not understand."
4,Works great but doesn't have a leather case as listed,This comes with a half leather and half nylon like the other ones. This specifically said all leather which is why I bought this one. It is a sturdy case and a great product but the listing was not accurate
1,Broken after 1st usage,"What a disappointment.I will update this comment with link to the pictures of the defects with this tool.What a lie.Image of how this product is broken right after the first usage1) High resolution image to show that the file's outer layer is heavily damaged, after its first usage on a aluminum surfaceURL is here [...]2) The turning axis gets loosen very easily, and you have to use the screwdriver to make it tighten almost every time you use it.URL is here [...]"
5,Awesome tool,"I'm a handyman and this is the first Leatherman I've owned. I now feel naked without it. I use it every day. I recomend it to anyone who needs to be able to grab the most common tools without carrying a tool box around. Often I can walk into a situation, pull out my Leatherman and fix things on the spot. Most commonly used items: screwdrivers, pliers, knife and saw blades."
5,Another excellent Leatherman product,"The Leatherman itself is, as ever with Leatherman products, absolutely excellent. Well made, versatile, tough... all as expected.HOWEVER, this product does NOT come with a 6-Bit Set. You will be paying an extra $18 or so for nothing. i.e. do NOT buy this product and instead buy the standard Leatherman unit on its own. If you want the extra bits then buy the 48-Bit Set that they produce..."
5,A Great Addition to the Series,O Come All Ye Faithful is a wonderful addition to the Tada/Macarthur music books. They are all filled with beautiful music and encouraging words and stories behind the songs.I would definitely recommend all of them!
4,A time-travel story with political intrigue and deception.,"If you like time-travel AND Christmas romance stories, this is a must-read. The characters are well-developed and likeable, and humourous parts are frequent, even during suspenseful moments. The author has provided good descriptions of the clothing, settings, and holiday customs of that time, as well as some British history.The political intrigue tended to drag on a little too long, while the ending could have been stretched out more, since it left me wanting for more details.Altogether, I would recommend this book, and will probably read it again next Christmas."
4,Better Than I Ever Thought It Would Have Been,"This is indeed a surprsingly very good family movie. From the previews, it looked kind of iffy, but it turned out to be really great. Steve Martin did an excellent job in this movie as the dad who has to try to keep 12 kids under control while the mom is gone. This movie has a lot of jokes that had me laughing minutes after the joke was finished. The only downside to the film is that towards the end, it tends to drag and lose steam. It goes from being really funny, to completely serious and a family moment kind of thing. This movie is worth seeing, it has some really funny stuff. It's inspired me to see the second film and the original movie. Overall, something I was surprised about how good it was."
4,a fun movie for children,a fun movie for children that adults can also relate to. This is a movie that parents and children can learn from.
4,"Not perfect, but Good","Most remakes fail in my opinion, but this one works because it was rewritten and not just a 'do over'. Other than the number of kids it has nothing in common with the original, that's fine. It's funny and it has some thoughtful moments. It is comedy and there is no way anyone could have twelve kids without humor. Bratty moments, selfish moments, and some attitude issues - like real kids.Any major move would upset even the best of families, ad career changes and going from country life to the suburbs would stress anyone out. It's kept light, but thoughtful and definitely has enough meat to it to satisfy."
3,It's a film for the family,"If you're looking for a film that's reasonable for the whole family (ie. kids over 6) then this is probably a decent choice. Our kids certainly seemed to enjoy it. It would not say this was the best acting I've seen in a long time from any of the characters, but it does keep moving along. If it's on sale and you need a backup movie to watch on a trip or while waiting for NetFlix this is a good choice."
1,Awful.,"I saw the previews for this and I thought it was going to be really funny. I laughed once during the entire film. It was a waste of time for me and I was just waiting for it to end. If you want to see this, I would suggest renting it because it's not worth the 20.00 price of the DVD."
2,A John Hughes comedy without John Hughes ain't much...,"This kinda movie makes you realize just what a Master the Great John Hughes was at family comedy. The Home Alones, Uncle Buck, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller, etc... Everything the guy touched turned to gold. Whatever happened to him anyway? They sure coulda used him here. This movies tries hard to be a Hughes type of film but all I could think while watching was how it could have been better scripted, acted, directed, scored, and better jokes.A lame directorial attempt made worse by the lame comedic timing of Ashton Kutcher, a lack of Steve Martins trademark physical comedy, and too many Nike endorsements among others. How many scenes was that one kid wearing that same Old Navy shirt?!?For those looking for a decent later years Steve Martin effort, Bringin Down the House was way better than this schlup, if there is such a word."
1,Go Watch the Freaking Original...,"Or read the book. The Original and the book were way better and could make you laugh, unlike this trivial piece of horrendous drivel. This is a travisty to the utmost power of hate."
3,"Good, but not great","I love Steve Martain. I loved the trailors that played on TV. Maybe I got my expectations up, but I feel this movie wasn't as good as the previews entailed. It had its funny moments but the movie had many boring movies. Warning:Don't spend $15 dollars to buy the movie, rent it. Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing,"Steve Martin plays, err Steve Martin (surprise) in the feelgood family ""ahhh""movie release over the holiday season last year. Somehow encumbered with 12 children he bumbles through a cheesy plot and encounters many hilarious yet touching episodes and lessons in life on how to be a good father, friend, confidante, and most importantly how to boost a recently flagging career with this kind of non taxing and benign drivel."
4,12 is a BIG Number,"Another suprise. I had doubts about this film when it premeired at Christmas, and that is why I waited to see it on DVD. Turns out this was a very likeable and enjoyable movie. Sure, some of it was exaggerated, like the chandelier hanging, and the huge vocabularies that magically every child had, but let's all remember it's only a movie. Steve Martin, who is doing productively well in the Family Movie genre, was great. Bonnie Hunt, who never does fail also good. The children were played rising child actors, like Piper Perabole, Hilary Duff, and Tom Welling. Ashton Kutcher did a great cameo as well. The film was funny, entertaining, and heartfelt, and it is good for anyone to see. I highly approve this film."
4,Really cute film!,I just watched this this evening and I thought that this was a really cute film!!! It was really funny in most parts and my son seemed to enjoy it as well (8 year old) this is the type of film that only comes along every once in a while...something that you and your family can all sit down with a huge bowl of popcorn and enjoy!!!
2,A o.k film.,"This film is alrite for little children, but for any one over the age of 12 years old they will fing this film a bit boring.It has no real stroy line to it, & it did'nt make me laugh once, actully i really even doubt young chlidren will like this film.Yet again dissipointed by steve martin, i can still remember when he usto have roles in good films like dirty rotten scoundrels, but those days mayb well be over.the only thing that even kept me watching this film was, ashton kutcher & Tom Welling ( also knowen as the good looking boy from smallville)so i would encoreage people to give this film a miss, by not watching it you not really missing anything."
3,a very warm film,"As family movies goes, this one is a nice one. It is warm and very funny. We left very touched and glad that someone out in Hollywood decided to make this category of film. I for one would love to see more family movies out there like this. As a parent, I do get tired of going to only cartoon movies, it was a nice change. :)"
2,You could find better family movies,"Cheaper by the Dozen is a hokey, predictable film with very few laughs. The kids generally don't come across as cute and, unless you are a kid, watching their tired antics and their efforts to ""outsmart"" the adults gets boring pretty quickly.The one enjoyable thing about this movie is Steve Martin. Still, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie because of him; he doesn't have good material to work with. If you want a great Steve Martin film that centers on family life and raising children, watch Parenthood."
3,Wears out it's welcome quickly,"It seemed that from the beginning this was a very labored project. Steve Martin tries his best to keep it moving along, but this is a slow moving, plodding story about 12 kids who hate their new neighborhood and want to go home. Tom (Steve Martin) gets his dream job as a big college football coach, but when his wife leaves for a book promotion tour, Steve has his hands full juggling teenage issues, child issues, and pressures at work. It's obvious that he has to choose one or the other, and right when the whole family explodes, ruining a chance for an Oprah Winfrey interview in their house, the final straw has fallen and they go home.This is not a movie I'd care to see again, frankly it gave me a headache. As a father, I understand all too well the pressures of career and family. To watch it on the screen is not my idea of escaping reality and being entertained."
3,Cute but not Great,This movie is alright. It is not one of my favorites nor will I ever watch it again. It is the story of a football coach with twelve kids and a wife who are all struggling to learn the lesson of compromise. While the movie has a lot of cute students and a lot of sub-plots about each of the different main characters I found this movie bordering on the annoying side of predictable. The director may have been trying to emphasize the lesson of parents making sacrifices for their kids but instead it came across as parents caving in to the wishes of whining brats. Shouldn't have remade this movie especially not with Steve Martin.
5,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!,"I loved this movie. I will say, that if you are over 15 you may not like it, but I think its really funny! Sara Baker is great! you should get this movie!"
3,not a solid movie,"Steve Martin was good as usual, but slightly out of place although he worked well with Bonnie Hunt. The whole movie was slightly out of control, so it was funny, but left you with an uneasy, unsatisfied feeling. Tom Welling seemed to switch characters every time you saw him, but he was nevertheless charming and very realistic. Hilary Duff stood out as being the bad actress she is because she was too old to get lost in the parade of under 12ers that made up most of the family, and because she seemed very very awkward the whole time. For a simple smile and forget it movie, this is the one for you, but as a whole, 3 stars was very generous."
1,Buy the 1950s movies (both of them) instead,"Alright maybe it's because I'm not a fan of that ""wild and crazy guy"", but when I heard about this film, I passed out. The trailer on TV was enough to make you think ""Oh, God another Steve Martin Turkey"". This film has no relation to the real story by this name told on screen in the 50s. I just bought copies of both of the films from the 50s to replace my taped copy. Those tell a more interesting story and the comedy is more genuine (even the slapstick moments), and they even have a nice dramatic story in them as well. Do yourself (and your DVD player) a favor, and don't contaminate it with this movie. Buy both 1950s era films (separately or the specially offered 2 pack, it doesn't matter), and watch a genuine family of 14 and how they lived."
5,Family Fun -- Family Values,"I love those big crazy family comedies, from the classics (like the 1950 original of this film) to ""Parenthood."" This ""Cheaper"" is funny and fast-moving for kids aged 6 and up and solid entertainment for parents. It covers a lot of ground emotionally and story-wise and is great to watch with a group. I also enjoyed a hilarious book, ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets"" (by Bruce Stockler) about a sleep-deprived Dad, a real-life ""Cheaper By The Dozen."""
5,Hilarious for people of all ages,"My entire floor went to go see this movie after Christmas break (that's right, 17-21 year old university students), and we all loved it. It was hilarious, the acting was great, the kids were adorable. It was a spontaneous, fun-filled movie, and everyone left the theatre with smiles on their faces! I would definately reccomend it to anyone looking for a movie to cheer them up, or just an opportunity to laugh. I'm definately buying this when it comes out on DVD!"
1,I walked out of the theater three times,Horrible. Awful. Embarrassing. A complete waste of the talents of Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt. Why do the parents care what the kids think? I was completely annoyed by this movie. Skip it immediately. The Lizzy Maguire girl should never be allowed to act again.
1,The original version was a true story....this is cheap humor,"The original 1950's version was based on a true story, written by two of the actual children portrayed in the movie. The remake (if you can even call it that), follows it's own plot, complete with distracted parents and out of control children. Watch the original, which in my opinion is a class act."
5,"Charmingly witty for the ""G-rated"" family","It appears the ""Cheaply made to make one sick"" reviewer is confusing this with another film. Cheaper is such a fine family film the Hollywood elite won't bother recognizing it as a movie worth lauding. It's refreshing to take children to such a picture. The standard obscenities and vulgarities were almost non-existent, which is encouraging in moviefare. I and my family thoroughly enjoyed this charming motion picture and encourage others to patronize such films in the interest of driving the money away from such wastes of celluloid as ""Bad Santa"""
1,why this movie stinks,"In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood.In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really ""love eachother"".If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called ""Melody"", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off."
2,The moral...?,"Not sure what the message to this film was: it seemed like 'Life may throw you a bone, but be prepared to turn aside your dreams for your family'. I suppose this is how life goes: I'd rather be an independent, poorly-paid comic book artist, but I work in software to pay the bills. I see Steve Martin's characters dillema in this film, and intead of ending up funny, it served more as a grim reminder of failing to have your dreams realized due to family committments.Or maybe I read into this film too much."
5,"STEVE, BONNIE, HILARY, PIPER, AND TOM ARE SO FABULOUS!!!","Cheaper By The Dozen is a great family film!! Steve, Bonnie, Hilary, Piper, and Tom are great actors, and this is such an enjoyable movie! It is SO FUNNY!! I never get tired if this DVD, and I've seen it at least 4 times!!"
5,Great Family Holiday Film,"I went to see with my parents and one of my four sisters, along with one of my eight cousins. Needless to say I have a big family. This movie was a great holiday film for the whole family. Hunt and Martin are delightful as parents of twelve kids. The chaos of the family compares to chaos in my family especially when the whole family is together. I recommend going to see this movie with your family. It will make you appreciate them and the time you have with them."
1,"A ""Remake""??","The only thing this ""remake"" has in common with the original is the title and the number of kids. The original is definitely the better of the two. This remake is cute, and I did laugh, but I am not thrilled with it."
3,Funny but nothing special...,This movie gave me quite a few laughs & it had some really great one-liners but other then that it didn't do much for me. The movie starts with the family in one small house then Steve Martin's chrachter gets a coaching job with a big raise & they move to another town in a very large house. The kids are mad about the move & they find it hard to fit in. Kids pull some pranks & there's a happy ending. Not a whole lot to it. I would only recommend this to 8-16 year olds. Not much fun for adults or really young ones.
2,Don't bother - Read the book or watch the original,"How the producers of this movie ever got to use the name ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is beyond me. It bears no resemblance to the book or the original movie, which was based on the book. The book is at least a 9 out of 10, the original movie is an 8, and this load of tripe is about a 3 or a 4."
5,Funny Family Movie,My nine year old laughed and laughed at this one!Steve Martin and supporting cast are hilarious. Many funny scenes that will make you chuckle repeatedly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
5,Wow,As every Steve Martin's movie this too was absolutely great.Tom Baker and his wife Kate have so many children that can't even remember their names. Twelve that is. They're both ambitious people. Tom is a football coach and Kate is a newly published writer and there's no nanny for 12 kids. So the 'hell' they go through is what this movie is all about.A must see Comedy. Hilarious.
4,I was pretty suprized.,"I am 19 years old and the oldest of 6 children (I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters). Now normally before i watch a movie i try to get people's opinions. I know it sounds somewhat weird, but i do. I dont feel like wasting my (or other people's) money. well with this movie, my parents said it was good and my youger sister said it was stupid. so i was pretty confused. So i went out and rented it myself. Personally i liked it. I have to agreee with an earlier review it did leave the kid's school plots hanging. And i cried during this movie. See during my senior year my dad moved us away from our home of 12 years to where i currently live. and we all had a hard time adjusting. So this movie touched me on a different level. I thought it was a sweet and charming movie! *^-^*"
2,"Heavy Handed, Tired Jokes","Of course, Steve Martin is a joy to watch in almost anything, and I was expecting a reprisal of his role in the wonderful PARENTHOOD. Sadly, this was not. I do not think he makes a believable football coach.But most of all, I was bored to tears and a little disgusted by kids bratty behavior being the centerpiece of the jokes. If you come from a large family, or know someone who does, you know that discipline is the cornerstone of that many people living together. I find it incredibly hard to believe that a parent of so many offspring would calmly accept or condone any of their behavior. I wanted to spank all twelve of them (and the parents for letting them get away with it)."
2,Don't bother...,We went for a family outing and wound up feeling depressed rather than amused. This is a story about a family falling apart -- self-absorption reigns in all of the adults! The kids' cuteness doesn't help much -- too many of them to get to know/care about any of the characters. Steve Martin's talents are wasted. Take the kids to something else...
1,Half-Baked and Annoying... .Not Funny At All...,"Tom (Steve Martin) stars as the father of 12 children. When offered a job in the big city, Tom can't resist taking it, even if it means moving his brood to the big city. But when Tom's wife also is offered her `dream job' can Tom cope?This started off as a cute movie. But quickly became stereotypical rubbish. People who live in the city are portrayed as rude obnoxious snobs, and the value of `small towns' is trumpeted.Also, the children were just rude obnoxious brats. They were far too old to act the way they did. If watching children puke, destroy the house, and play cruel pranks on each other is your cup of tea, you might like Cheaper by the Dozen. For me. I found the movie obnoxious and the message clear: ""Small towns= Good, Big City=Evil"" and ""men are incapable of parenting properly."" Sorry, I don't buy either."
1,Hang on,"From someone who has read ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Bells on Their Toes,"" and has seen the wonderful classic movies of both books, I doubt this movie has any similarities with the real-life story except for the fact that they have alot of kids. Steve Martin is a terrifically funny actor, but I doubt even he could make this movie as good as its predecessors."
3,"Nice flavor, but packed a long time ago","It tastes very good, though I imagine it would taste much better if it hadn't been packed more than two years ago (received January, 2013, packed November, 2010), though I still have nearly a year of freshness, according to the package"
1,Do not buy this particular tea...,"This tea supposed to be really good, but... It is awful and I think I know why. It is kept in the wrong environment or was acquired from oriental supermarket where it was laying for a long time. It is in a loose paper bag and it is absorbed all the ""aromas"" of typical oriental market and thus has awful taste. There will be no returns or exchange or anything of that nature. There were times when this tea was in a sealed plastic bag inside and that was my favorite tea, not anymore."
2,won't buy it again,the tea taste very bad. but I am not too surpised since the price is cheap. I won't buy it again.
2,Broken,I am a fan of gunpowder tea and have been for years. The flavor is about what I would expect from a gunpowder tea. The problem with this product is that the pellets were either broken or made up of leaf shreds instead of whole leaves and seem to lack the density I'm used to. Part of this may be that the packaging is a thin cardboard box and not a tin. I don't know if this is normal for the brand as it is my first purchase and probably my last. I'll try other new (to me) gunpowder tea marketers or go back to some of my tried and true brands.
1,horrible,"I bought this tea at an Asian market here in town. the box looks the same but the tea was horrible. It doesn't look like little green balls of tea leaves, it looks almost black. No tight little balls, the leaves expanded a little bit when in the water, there are tons of stems just thrown in there. It looks like shredded little leaves and stems. The tea turned out yellowish brown. I can stand anything just about anything so this was drinkable, but the quality was terrible. I don't know if this is how the brand always comes or if there was a problem with mine."
4,Self Installed on a KelTec Sub 2K,"I installed the Weaver Converta Mount Part 48881 for Remington 870 See Under mount on my KelTec Sub 2K for installing an optical sight on top of the rifle that is positioned just above the plastic sights of the rifle. This required quite a bit of fitting and alignment. This is not the original intended use for these mounts. I was quite pleased with the results as it gave me a firm and usable scope mount for my KelTec. The base item is a 48302 marked ""Weaver B2"". The top bracket is item 48311 marked ""Weaver S3"". The combination raises the center of the scope about 3/8"" above the existing sights which is what I needed. Small washers were used to shim the base to align with the barrel axis and vertical. See pictures I will try to include. I did have to drill 4 holes to get the spacing I wanted. Note: on the KelTec the screws interfered with the barrel and had to be filed down. Watch where you drill the holes. The stock must be removed first."
2,Can't navigate DVD's without remote,"I have had this for a while and gotten some good use out of it. However, once the remote died (It would cost $75 to replace) I have been unable to watch DVD's satisfactorily. There are buttons on the unit for going forward and back a scene, but no menu button and no buttons that let you navigate around menus (also no fast forward or rewind buttons). I tried to watch TV collections, but with some of them it is now impossible to view anything but the first show. If not for this issue, I would probably give the item four stars because of its versatility."
2,Not happy because of..,"I was happy when I bought this, as this is very compact and useful to play both casette and dvd. But sooner, the casette player stopped working if I hookup the LCD monitor (I am thinking that this is because of the power input is not sufficient to play both LCD monitor as well as Casette). However, I can play DVD and view it in the LCD monitor.If I do not use the attached LCD monitor, but redirect the output to a regular TV, then Casette works with out any problem.When I contacted Audiovox (at probably 13th or 14th month), they told it is not covered under warranty so the flat price is around 100 dollars (did not remember exact amount), plus shipping charges.So, did not opt to repair it and kept quiet."
4,Great choice if you have a large VHS Library as well as DVD,There are many more compact DVD units out there at this price but the built in VHS player meant we didn't need to replace all the kids classics at $10-$20 a title.Great unit is you what VHS with DVD and can handle the size (SUV and Minivan ok). It's really a transportable home/car/hotel unit as it needs an external power supply.A great feature when buying an additional screen means the kids can watch different movies ( one VHS one DVD) at the same time. Saves some heated discussions.Great bundle but pass if you just want DVD.
3,mobile video,"this the second one I bought. The first one came with an inoperable vcp (VCR without ability to record). I sent it back and got a refund. I bought the second one and the dvd did not ""read' the dvds. This time I sent it back to Audiovox and paid the 14.00 for shipping. They paid for the return shipping and it has been working well since that time.Overall it is good for us to have both formats. The unit comes with great carrying bags and protective wrap for the screen. You have many options on how to atach it in your vehicle."
2,Disappointed us...,"I have owned this product for about a year now. I also purchased the extra screen so each of my children would have their own to view. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this product. Within about 2 months, the second screen quit working. Within approximately 4 months the DVD player stopped altogether. Now we're stuck with only the VHS portion of the player and one screen. It's better than nothing, but for what we spent on both items, it should have held up longer. And we've been very gentle with them too. Our previous vehicle had a dealership-installed system in it and I was hoping to get the same effect with this in our new SUV. Sorry to say, I think we should have opted for the installed system. We'll know for next time. :/"
4,Magical Mystery Tour,"Collin Cotterill's mysteries are set in the 1970's in Laos, of all places. His mystery series features Dr. Siri an aged, wise coroner and his co-workers Geung and Nurse Dtui. This books mixes elements of the spirit worlds (but no so much as to make the books unbelievable) and real world. The plot is easy to follow and the characters well-developed."
4,Disco for the Departed,Cottreil's mystery series on Laos are excellent. Having travelled to Laos shortly after the period set out in the book I can attest to its good capture of the atmosphere at the time.
3,A light procedural,"It was a bit confusing for a while,but after getting into it,I appreciated the way it communicates the way of life in Laos."
