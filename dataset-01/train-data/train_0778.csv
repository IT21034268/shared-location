4,"Disturbingly emotional, clings to ones mind...","When I finished this book, I was plagues for weeks afterword by its haunting feeling and amazingly real characters. Thats something that impresses me about Hospital, she writes with such feeling, the characters just would not leave my mind. Sometimes, however, the emotion overtook the evolution of plot, and I must say I was disappointed by the ending. But if you give this one time and are open to it, it will take you on a trip. Masterful prose."
3,self-consciously literary,"I read The Last Magician because I found Orpheus Lost hauntingly lovely and profoundly moving. The Last Magician feels like a much earlier novel written with a self-consciously literary style that precociously interferes with the narrative at times, with a feel of pretentiousness and sophomoreishness.But I'm back to try another because even though it taxed my patience to get through intrusive allusions, The Last Magician held a true and complex vision, hard to encounter but compelling to read."
3,"Good writing, lackluster story","Turner is an engaging writer. She could probably write a recipe that would keep your attention. However, the story she develops here entirely lacks a satisfactory conclusion and the beginning of the book seems more pretentious than challenging. If one knew Lucy as a real person, she'd be frustrating as her story bounces too often to maintain rapt attention. Still, if you've nothing else to read soon, it's not the worst book to spend time reading and there are some interesting viewpoints to be shared with the characters."
5,"Cantatas Vol. 34 (BWV 1, 126, 127) [Hybrid SACD] / Bach Collegium Japan * Suzuki","Cantatas Vol. 34 (BWV 1, 126, 127) [Hybrid SACD] / Bach Collegium Japan * Suzuki is a recording under the direction of Masaaki Suzuki who leads the Bach Collegium Japan on this BIS Records AB from 2007. Having listened to many of Masaaki Suzuki's recordings it was a natural to pick this up at my local library. His quality is consistent and once more I can recommend this fine recording. Klaus Hofmann and Masaaki Suzuki have written the liner-notes and also included are short biographies of the performers, conductor and orchestra. Highly recommended. 5/5."
4,Calc questions,"I bought a lot of calc resources at the same time. This book is great, but it is slightly over whelming... I wish I could get it in digital form or change the order of the questions. However it is a good resource."
1,Too narrow-minded,"The book gives a good historical perspective, but fails on two major levels (both highly predictive): (1) the author obviously buys into the current baby bell hype and chooses xDSL as a superior technology to cable modems. (2) wireless communications are completely dismissed as cost prohibitive."
3,the name of the song at the end of the film!,"After reading all the reviews I came across an email asking the name of the song played when Henry (Colin Firth) gets of the boat. The song is infact called ""Have I Told You Lately"" and it is by Van Morrison and is NOT by Rod Stewart!! Oh and the soundtrack is very good! Pity Van Morrison's song is not featured because I absolutely love it!!"
3,Whats that song?,"Could some one tell me the name of the song played just before the fashion parade, it's ""Gotta keep moving"" or something like that?First time poster ""Help"" Have looked at other reviews so don't know why i dont have the voting buttons."
5,THIS SOUNDTRACK IS DEFINETLY BETTER THEN PRINCESS DIARIES,Look at the subject first then read on. I love this soundtrack I can't even put feelings and thoughts into words for this. For one thing I going to pre order the dvd of this when it comes available.
2,Where's The Beef?,"On this soundtrack, too much very good and great arrangements are missing that were in the movie. You will not hear James Brown's 'Get Up Offa That Thing' which was even better when played by Oliver James at the party in the film. You will also not hear 'Have I Told You Lately', 'What A Wonderful World"", 'Heaven Is A Place On Earth', 'Shout', 'Because You Love Me' and 'You Get Me'. I bought the CD based on other reviews, and when I listened the first time, it was good, but wow - it is like buying a hamburger and leaving out the beef. Taste good but leaves you feeling as though you missed something. Oh well, at least they were kind enough to include Oliver James songs on the CD. Who ever put the soundtrack together, must have forgotten to cut Oliver out too, because they sure cut out all the rest of the best. This could have been the greatest soundtrack, but the record label missed."
1,Disappointing...,"I was very disappointed to find so many good songs missing. This movie has a great soundtrack, all inclusive. If only a few songs can be chosen, they should be the songs, original or covered, that cannot be obtained elsewhere.The missing Oliver James and Kelly Preston songs were great and deserve to be here. While I love songs such as Derringer's Rock and Roll Hoochicoo, I CAN get it on Derringer's own album. But there is no where that I've found where I can get Oliver James' cover of Get Up Offa That Thing!My preference would be to pay a little more and have a two-CD set that included ALL the songs. Too bad so many songs are missing. It could've been a great CD!"
2,WHAT?,"The songs in the movie is super great, but the soundtrack.. what happened?? Where are the songs sung by Kelly Preston? The producers made a mistake when leaving those out."
2,"Warner Bros, are you daft????","you left the very best music off of the soundtrack. Oliver James does a great job on all his songs, why in the world would you not include it on the soundtrack."
4,oliver james,"This wasnt a movie I would have normally gone to see, being 23 years old. My little cousins asked me to take them. I was thoroughly impressed with oliver james' 2 songs. I don't know if he wrote them himself, but none the less, he has an incredible voice."
3,Um?.......,"I don't have this Album yet and this is why.....What is the name of the song wereDaphne is at the one place where her dad gets a tattoo what is the name of the song that is playing wile she trys on cloths? It goes a little like this (Or at laest what I can remember) ""Keep my body rockin'...."" and so on? Please HELP! If you knpw then just post"
3,"Movie-fantastic, soundtrack-not what I expected","When I saw the movie I thought it was hilarious and cute but I didn't enjoy the movie because of that. I enjoyed the movie because of the hottie Oliver James who plays Ian Wallace. I loved the songs they played in the movie especially Kelly's and Oliver's. Thinking all those songs would be on the soundtrack I bought the cd and it wasn't the greatest, I mostly like the 2 songs performed by Oliver, those were great."
5,Best Chick Flick & Soundtrack in YEARS,"I recently saw the movie "" What A Girl Wants."" And after seeing the movie it is by far the best chick flick in years. The story is profound with a hip flare that would relate to any girl, the music is amazing with such variety of the decades that it can capture any woman's heart, and well.....Oliver James....he is pretty much self- explanatory. i totally recommend buying both the CD and the Movie."
2,not worth the money,the cd is so stupid i only like 3 songs this is a bad cd dont buy this stupid cd it is not worth it
5,This C.D. Rockz!,"I luv this c.d.! It's got a TON of gr8 songs! My favorites are: Good Life, Crazy, Who Invited You?, Kiss Kiss, I Wanna Be Bad, Somebody Stop me :), Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo, What's Good For Me, and Ride of Your Life. It has a lot of rock songs and a few slow. There are a variety of singers and you just have to pick this soundtrack up 2day!!. : Caitlin : ."
2,wow.,"I watched the movie for one reason : Oliver James. The music on it was horrible, but then again I'm not a pop fan. The songs I did like were the ones Oliver sang and London Calling by The Clash. How you can give that 3 stars whilst the rest get 5 is beyond me. The Clash are one of the best if not the best punk rock band of the 80s. You've got to give them more credit than something that ""sounds great"" in your opinion. It's the best song on the whole freaking cd. Craig David was good until he sold out to an appealing American crowd. Actually, Duncan Shiek (Sheik? whatever) is pretty good. Other than that I don't recommend anyone buying this album unless you're really into pop. But I don't think fans of The Clash wouldn't waste their money buying this album for just one of their songs when they could buy an album of their taste."
3,What's the name of this song?,"Hi all! I was wondering if anyone knew the name of the song playing when Amanda Bynes is like at a market in London spending the day with Oliver James ...it's a girl singing it and it says something like ""You get me..."" over and over again. It's not in the soundtrack - shame. Help please!"
4,Help with this song please,Ok first of all this cd is pretty nice yes some of the best songs are left out.Does anybody know the song Daphane(Amanda Bynes) is on her bed with the radio and heaphones on listening to who I thinks isSkye sweetnam. Does any one know that song? or artist if I got it wrong.Email or post email tomyrealthoughts@gmail.com
3,Lots of good songs missing!,"Some people have been asking: the song played before Daphne enters the fashion show (you know, the one that sounds all jazz-y and was also on a recent car commercial) is called ""GET A MOVE ON"" by MR. SCRUFFY. Hope that helps.Anyway, the title of my review pretty much says it all. There are some great songs on this soundtrack, but it is missing a lot of the songs from the movie. If you would be satisfied with missing some of the songs that Oliver James and Kelly Preston sang on the movie, then buy this. It's better than nothing!"
5,Crazy For Oliver James,This is such a good cd. Oliver James's voice drives me crazy! it is just so amazing!! Does anyone know if he has a cd out?
1,Jar opener not worth the money,I had an opener similar to this one a few years ago that worked like a charm so I purchased this one when we moved into a new house. It must be made differently because it does not work at all...looks the same but does not open anything.
3,Footage still missing,"Buyer beware, this movie does NOT contain the censored footage. It is still missing from the beginning of the movie. Good transfer, good movie."
2,Beware survey type books...,"I haven't read the book, but this is a word of warning from an enviromental professional, and former expert witness in aerial photographic interpretation.Beware so called survey books. Any book that purports to cover a topic as complex as environmental site investigation in under 400 pages has to and ought to be looked at skeptically.A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Granted it might be useful to lawyers, you know, the bunch that are first with the obvious. By the title, I gather that is the audience the author is pandering to.My 6 year degree in geology and remote sensing did not totally prepare me for my role as an expert in aerial photo interpretation. Several thousand pages of additional reading and countless hours behind a stereoscope did.So see the book for what it appears to be, an expensive overview of a very complex and interrelated discipline that should only be dabbled into by trained scientists and environmetal engineers."
3,A surprise or two,"If not perhaps the equal of Vol. 1 this does have the first three episodes of the Ronald HowardTV series. Interesting and enjoyable in and of themselves, these appear to be original printsbringing with them a blast of fresh air. A revelation after years of watching murky dupes! Thehansom Dr. Watson here is H. Marion Crawford whose father was known to turn a mean classic horrorstory back in the day."
2,Wrench earrings,We love the earrings but they started changing colors just in a few days of wearing them.
3,"I must of missed the sign, wheres the real 42nd street!",This book is good for all ages. Moslty fo those who are fans of that genre.
4,helpful so far.,"I have not read the book in entirety, but what I have read explained so much that we often ignore. This book is for everyone; Everyone has insecurities great or small and it will help you and challenge you to understand yourself a little bit better. Inside, there are some inventories that ask you to compare yourself with a given list. Those are really good for reflecting on what has actually happened in your life and how those experiences have shaped you."
4,Feeling insecure!!!,This is good book for those of a tenderheart who are to tenderhearted for their own good. Hang in their and read this book!!!!
4,Am Very Pleased,Great condition for the price and the shelf wear stated. Would purchase again for sure. Thank you
1,No Substance,"The subject matter of this book is one which deserves serious exploration. In fact, the subtitle ""Conquering Your Insecurity"" was a big enticement (if only...). Unfortunately, this book explores and recommends very little. Once the premise is set forth, that tenderheartedness or toughheartedness is a congenital predisposition, and how it comes about, and how it manifests itself in daily life, (career, relationship, etc.) the book goes no further - just keeps repeating and attempting to substantiate that premise. The ""case studies"" used to demonstrate these ideas are WAY too long and utterly lack substance. It's like when someone says ""to make a long story short..."" you know you're in for a long, drawn out nothing. If you're looking for concrete self-help, thought provoking substance and engaging reading, this ain't it. See Marcy Calhoun's ""Are You Really Too Sensitive?"" It's substantive, meaningful and useful on this subject. Best wishes to all who are searching."
3,Interesting overview but not much application,"The author explains and reexplains *where* how a person may develop tender-heartedness but does little to fulfill the promise of conquering insecurity. The first few chapers were a good overview, but there was not much practical advice for how to deal with emotional predators in, say, the workplace. I'm eager to check out some of the books other users here have suggested instead..."
2,Subtitle inacurate,"Yes - this book did have a great start... I was flipping through the pages reading each one carefully waiting to see where the author gets to the ""conquering your insecurites""... I was left with a one page- three step recipe to acomplish what the book claims. The title is misleading... maybe it was done so purposefully to write part II?"
1,Nice Idea,"If only people were this concrete and would quit bothering others with their annoying complexities. In addition to the thoughts expressed in the other reviews I was confused by the author's idea that it is best to ""get out"" of a relationship with some one who is insecure (because they won't change) in a book that is supposed to help people who are insecure."
5,His best work in years with still more to come.,"This is the Jones album that everyone who ever heard George sing will agree is his best in quite awhile. As a fan I have collected over 40 of his albums, and while I treasure everyone of them, this goes to the front of the case. ""Wild Irish Rose"" shows that his voice is as strong as it has ever been, while ""Over You"" reflects the great emotion that he can bring to a song. ""Over You"" puts a lump in my throat everytime I hear it. If you like traditional ballads this is the album for you. It is a true shame that this artist and much of his best work will never get the air time it deserves."
3,"Not the worst, but not for me","I've listened to this set a few times now and I don't think there's much here to excite a hard-core fan of underground dance music. Morillo's mixing is pretty good, and there's nothing amazingly wrong with most of the tracks - in fact some of them are quite good - but the overall sound is a bit too commercial for my taste - the kind of shallow, tribal-ish stuff you'd hear in a popular Miami club. I don't find it particularly groovy or funky, and there are too many vocal tracks. If you really like mainstream vocal/tribal house, you'd probably like this, and you could do a LOT worse (*cough* Louie DeVito *cough*). Otherwise, skip it."
1,What?,"First of all let me just say that Erick Morillo is excellent 'live'. His legendary sets at Space and Crobar are beyond comparison. However, he really dissapoints with this ""played out"" mix. The track selection is so old and played out...it makes me wonder if he is truly connected with what is happening in the scene.If I hadn't heard him live then I would think that Morillo is washed up."
4,A Good book for websphere.,"I brought this book seeing the reviews of many thank full friends and i am impressed.I have read the first 4 chapters untill now, and I liked the new topics and ideas the author has introduced. They are very usefull in every stage of developing J2EE applications. I am sure any one who read this book wil have a thorough grip of websphere functionality.Also this book is for versions 3.5 and 4 but the author has mentioned the version 5 specific changes also.I am giving 4 stars for its detail explanation of websphere install,configuration, programming and fine tuning."
4,Comprehensive WebSphere book ...,"The book provides a detailed picture of using WebSphere, in particular the books attention to administrative issues made it stand out against other WebSphere books. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend, if your looking to add a WebSphere book to your library this is the one!"
2,So far haven't been able to get into this one,For some reason I have started this book several times; but just have not been able to get interested in the story. I've found so many books that are better; just haven' made my self settle down and read it. When and if I ever get into it will review.
5,progold and deoxit,"these are the 2 best contact/conditioner products availabe at this time I strongly recomend the concentrated bottles with brush in cap. these products remove tarnish and maintain electrical conductivity, very good for hi-fi stereos especially turntabes first clean thoroughly then wipe on very sparingly, lasts for yrs. once complete."
4,"GREAT PLAYER, VERY PRICEY AND MISSING SOME FEATURES","Alright, I had this thing for about 2 weeks when I returned it. The picture is awesome, very clear and the sound from the little speakers is superb. I bought it in a retail store for $699. Very expensive. The battery may last 2.5 hours but not with the brightness turned up. My biggest complaint is that it DOES NOT have an AUX imput feature. For that much $ I wanted a little monitor that I could plug whatever I wanted into. You cant with this one, you can only use it as a disc player. Also it does not have the card slot. The best things are the flip flop screen that is nice but not necessary and the fact that it does have progressive scan (or so the box states). Its a great player but the high price tag along with the missing AUX made me pass on it. I think I will get the DVD-LA95 from Panasonic, a price drop has made it a good buy."
4,nice player,I like the picture quality and the sound is great. You may only get a 2.5 hour battery with the player but the option to buy an 8 hour battery is very nice since no other player offers that.
1,A Sham,Don't expect to listen the original songs. This 5 CDs box set is full of remixes you have never heard. Many of these remixes are so terrible that you can hardly identify the original song.
2,"An interesting album, but doesn't stand the test of time.","Woody Herman always kept his band relevant, and didn't keep playing standards from the 30's and 40's, like many of his contemporaries. His exploration of rock tunes in the late 60's, early 70's, is laudable, and arguably more listenable than the original artists, at least to jazz fans. These songs contain inspired solos by many of Herman's sidemen. However, the arrangements as a whole, don't hold up well 40 years later, and exaggerate the inherent weakness of these songs. Demonstrating what jazz purists have discovered in the succeeding decades. Rock songs don't adapt well to the jazz idiom.At albums end, the listener may conclude that they have just heard a halftime performance of a college marching band from 1970. Fortunately, Herman returned to less experimental music during the short remainder of his career. I don't think this, or any succeeding ""Herd"", revisited any of these tunes in later years."
3,Confusing!,"I think the premise of the diet is a good one. Thebook is very short and easy to read and entertaining. I liked the book. The problem I had with it and it is a big problem, is that it tells you two different things.In the first chapter titled- What The Diet Is, the author begins by stating:""This really is a simple diet. It can be summed up in one sentence: EAT FEWER THAN 60 GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRATE A DAY.""He continues in that vein by giving a sample menu for what he says ""Is what we serve ALMOST EVERY DAY IN OUR HOUSEHOLD WHEN WE ARE KEEPING STRICKLY TO THE DIET. The total grams of carbohydrate to be consumed in that day are 33 grams.But at the end of the book he states: ""You don't have to go overboard on cutting down carbohydrates. Get AT LEAST 60 grams a day.""So which is it? Eat less than 60 grams a day or get AT LEAST 60 grams a day?Oh editor! Calling the editor! Was there an editor for this book? You missed a pretty big goof up there. What's a reader to do?"
4,Amazon book purchase,I love the book. Thank you. It did take longer than expected to arrive but my emails questioning where it was were all responded to immediately.
2,A Toilet Read,Not really a book. Just a pre Atkins brochure.Crap you already know if a low carber! The carbo tables in the back are good for reference.
3,"Good introduction, but only an introduction.","I basically agree with K. Dorsey's earlier review. This doc is certainly enjoyable and put together well, but it's an extremely brief and shallow introduction. In the vast majority of cases we get only brief fragments of performances. The experience is a little like listening to preview clips on Amazon Music, but with visuals. Somewhat frustratingly, the major exception to this is Björk. I adore Björk, but she's already a well-known international star and I'd rather hear and see some of the lesser-known artists.I'm glad I've seen this - I'm highly motivated to track down some more music from some of these artists. So, as a promo vid for the Icelandic music scene, it's a success. As a documentary, it's a bit underwhelming."
3,medium,"This portable has what you need for listening to music. it soounds good and it looks good and it is priced much better than sony. the thin batteries are great and it lasts longer than i expected. optional dongle included too.Shortcomings:Headphone wires are just the annoying length that they are never fitting in any application. Too short and too asymmetrical in an annoying way. sound quality is good but they are not comfortable.Also the unit looks more solid in the pictures but in reality it is slightly fragile in feel.overall: for the price, great. if you want to pay more just get an ipod."
2,Remote control is useless,"I have this player for nearly a year, and overall am disappointed in it. It has a rechargeable battery, but I already used rechargeable AA batteries in my old CD player. The remote control is useless because the press/tilt button always does the wrong thing for me, and I don't use any of the other controls on the remote control. I could never figure out where to attach the remote control to my clothing, and recently the clip broke off so I cannot attach it at all. The track and time display is on the remote control, not on the CD player, so I am stuck with this surprisingly heavy and awkward remote control dangling from the headset. Finally, the asymmetrical length cords on the included ear buds are a terrible idea: unless I attached the remote control to my shirt collar, the left ear bud would pull out of my ear when I looked up because the cord was so short, so I've thrown them away."
2,press,"When it worked it worked well. After 3 months the glass shattered in my hand. No injury but a terrible mess. When I contacted the manufacturer, it was $20 to replace the glass carafe. I can buy a new one for 20 at Walmart."
5,Analog Grip Clip,This is a durable watch for men that can't afford to wear a watch on their arm because of safety hazard at work. These are hard to find but last 2 to 3 years with everyday use. Highly recommend for the working man
3,"good, nothing fancy","this is a good product, I wear this watch on my pfd (life jacket) when I am kayaking and appreciate the rotating watch face so that I can read it looking down. Setting the time is done with a pin that is hidden when the face in closed, which is an excellent feature.major con is that the watch does not lock closed, and will rotate with very little pressure. this exposes the pin. all in all, a good tool, nothing fancy."
1,"A different, darker, tone than most of Swindoll's work.","As a fan of Chuck Swindoll, I've read and really enjoyed many of his books. This one, however, has a tone I haven't seen before. He paints a dark and foreboding picture of those who love the Lord. 'You may be in the depths of despair,' 'you may be at a very bad time in your life,' 'you may be very unhappy,' 'you may have just lost a loved one,' etc. The book is full of this type of thoughts. I really fell sorry for Swindoll, who, after thirty years in the ministry can say, ""But I can't name many true, caring, servanthearted shepherds."" He must have had a rough ministry, because a pastor can't live without such people. The book is about 10% Moses and 90% Swindoll's dark lessons to be learned from Moses' life. I liked it about 10%. As opposed to Phillip Yancey's uplifting books, The Jesus I Never Knew, and What's So Amazing About Grace, Moses left me really down."
1,Life After Being A Ski Bum,"If you are interested in accomplishing nothing in your life then grab this book. It is irrefutable evidence that you too can live a meaningles life, bumming around California, after having flopped in Europe and Colorado. A sappy memoir posing as a guide to adventure."
1,Almost useless,"There are at most 30 pages worth remembering, but you have to read through 378 to find them."
4,A good handbook for those brushing up on Latin,An excellent Grammar handbook for those who have a little bit of Latin knowledge and want to brush up on their grammar skills. It is not a book for beginners since very little explanation is given. It is used primarily as a summary for what you learn in more extensive Latin learning books. A must-have for those who are using Henle's Latin 1 book.
5,Liber Magnus,"I have quite a collection of Latinlanguage instruction books, but Ifind myself continuously returningto Henle's ""Latin: Grammar"" wheneverI want to quickly answer a questionabout a point of grammar.It is concise and nicelyorganized for ease of use.This is not a language learningcourse book.Henle did produce a series of Latinlanguage instruction books that havebeen used in schools, Catholic schoolsin particular, for years and currentlyby many home-schoolers.I do not like those books and disposedof mine in favor of a number of betterones, but the grammar book is a keeper.This book is not the only goodLatin grammar available, but it isone that every Latin student shouldhave at hand because it will be usedoften."
3,Not for beginners,"I am a studying linguist and hoped to get a bit of knowledge about Latin because bit of work that I complete involving the Romance languages. I must say that the book's reputation was not deserved. Even for one with an extensive knowledge of Grammar and comparative grammars, I found Robert Henle's explation of certain rules to be under-developed. I also believe that the numbering of the rules seemed to be more of a distraction than a heuristic device. However, the grammar does seem to be a very inclusive one, and those who know or have studied grammar can gain a lot of information at a fast pace (provided they know what they are looking for). Explanations of the case system could have been a bit clearer, as well as the explanation of the morphology of the verbs. This is not a book for a begining student of foreign languages unless they have studied their own grammar extensively."
5,Beautiful Paper,I love paper of all kinds and this particular package of wrapping paper is unique as well as beautiful. I bought it mainly because of the dragonfly on one of the sheets of wrapping paper. I think the gift wrap is a little expensive ($4.95) for only 4 sheets but the thickness and quality of the paper is top of the line. I used half of the dragonfly print paper as a centerpiece on my dining room table under a vase of flowers. It looks gorgeous (like a stylish place mat). I'm sure that there are lots of different uses for this paper due to the design and quality beyond just wrapping a gift.
2,Disappointing,"The colors shown on the website are far more bold than what the paper actually is. It's as if the inkpens on the printer needed to be changed, and weren't. Oddly enough, the accompanying giftcards do reflect the same vivid colors that are on the website, so don't really match the paper."
5,very pretty and unique,"This is bright, pretty wrapping paper that will please any lover of art and color. Im saving this for someone special :) The quibbles I have: there are artifacts during the printing (which you wouldnt find in Hallmark giftwrap), the black ""leading"" was too thick IMO and detracted from the overall look and the gift cards are quite small and you need to cut them out yourself."
2,Another disappointed customer,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who rated this paper two stars: the colors on the web and on the carton covering the paper are more vivid than the colors of the wrapping papers themselves. Also, the papers are somewhat small. All in all, too expensive for what one gets. I am really disappointed. Maybe the customers who rated this paper 5 stars got theirs from a different production batch. I am taking away one star for the color, another for the size, and another for the price."
4,Seventies Time Capsule,"I remember watching this on TV as a child! Bill Cosby stars as a struggling member of the working poor, helplessly watching his only child slowly dying of sickle cell anemia. It really is a very moving story; you get a sense of the overwhelming frustration experienced by those who never seem to get ahead, despite their hardest efforts. It's a low budget, made-for-tv, four-hanky tearjerker of the type they used to make in the 1970s, and it's great to see that it has an audience once more!"
1,8 peices of Junk ...!!,"These speakers quality is just next to crap , i mean these speakers dont even have any dam sound quality or deep bass to enjoy , i got them first for my audigy 2 ZS card , and they performed so bad i returned to the dealer and got myself "" Logitech Z-5300 5.1 Speakers "" , these speakers have real quality and are THX certified so if anyone is putting money in 7800 i request dont do it and get yourself a Z 5300 ."
3,"Appearance doesn't mean Performance, Quantity doesn't mean..","*Pros:1. Excellent High Frequencies in the front speakers with tweeters.2. Balanced, accurate and deep Bass reproduction.3. CMSS up-mix feature for 5.1 & 6.1 sound card.4. The best performance of this system is in GAMING.*Cons:1. Weak mid-range at high volume, especially in Voices.2. The strength of side and rear speakers is not the same of three front speakers.3. To achieve the best performance of this system, at least 5.1 sound card is required.4. Its Quality doesn't match its price"
3,"Okay sound, disappointing performance","I purchased this product in Dec. '05. It worked okay for 2 years, but I was never able to get full 7.1 sound out of it, even when paired with a Creative Soundblaster Audigy card. After 2 years, the speakers stopped working one day. Creative only offers a 12 month limited warranty to I was SOL.In summary - Creative makes good speakers, but be warned that they may not last long."
4,Good Price and Great Sound Quality,"Pretty Good. I have being using for more than a month. These speakers are excellent even when they are just haphazardly close together. Most kinds of music; jazz, classical, country and the list goes on, sound are exciting. Sounds came in every direction rather than from just 2 speakers. Once the speakers are well placed, the sounds are fascinating. So, it is pretty good set for someone who is looking to spend about a medium range of price on speakers.The speakers themselves are very good with my system and they also perform very well and bring out the rich environmental sounds. Overall, it is good price and great sound quality."
5,Great Value,"I was lucky to get this speakers, cause they where on slae at Frys electronics. When i ask the seller why where they on discount, he told me htat thet where new in the store and people had been complaining about uncompatibility with their cards. Since i had just bought an X fi car, i decided to check the creative web page before buying and i found out that tehre was an update available for the card, i didnt hesitated and bought them right away, its been over a year now and i am very happy since they are well priced and have great sound quality, SPECIALY for gaming. You wont regret but you definetly need a nice soundcar."
2,I had to return mine...,"Well when I ordered this product I was very excited, of course. I was pleased with how quickly I received the it, and the packaging looked good. Those reasons are why this still has 2 stars. Otherwise the product itself was defective. I was unable to get the full experience of 7.1 sound due to the side speakers not working. I spent close to a week and a half with tech support before they finally said to go ahead and ship them back. The processing board in the sub unit was defective causing the side speakers to not emit sound. This all being said, I still like Creative and will still support Creative. I have used the company from the beginning and still believe they make good products. I guess I got poked by the fickle finger of fate."
4,very good speakers,"theyre amazing speakers, i havent ever had 7.1 sound but its amazing, i have the Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS and it sounds wonderful"
4,Aquashock,"The squirt gun lacks a traditional trigger and is fired by the pump. The sneak attack idea is pretty cool concept, though I have yet to use it. My only problem with the squirt gun is that it leaks from somewhere near the pump action frame."
3,water gun,will have to turn the cap clock-wise to open for refill of water (bad design) but in general the product was fine.
1,"Bought 5, down to 1","All but one unit has burned up, after only a few hours of usage, total.The failure in each is exactly the same. There is barking noise, the motor slows down, smoke emits.The XPR 400 is a discontinued junk joke."
4,Very useful and safe.,"We started using this sleep bag when our baby was 3 months and started sleeping in his crib. In his bassinet, I could tuck the blanket in securely under the mattress, but the crib was too large to do this and I just didn't feel safe using a regular blanket. This worked great! I put him in a lightweight footed sleeper and then in the sleep bag right before bed. When this was in the wash, I used the Carter's fleece sleep bag that actually has sleeves so it's all one piece and that was nice too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the fabric could be a little softer. I have the terry cloth kind and it did pill quite a bit too. I think they make a cotton version of this as well that's more like a t-shirt. I've seen used one's of those and they do pill a bit, but appeared quite a bit softer."
3,got a small size,"I wanted a large size and received a small .. I don't know where the size appears on this site, I hope this is fixed so it doesn't happen to other customers.."
3,Panjabi MC and the big Jay-Z,"Heard this first in Ft. Lauderdale, March '03 from some club on A1A. The backbeat caught my ear right away- the hook from Busta Rhymes' ""Fire It Up""/Knight Rider theme. Jay-Z and Panjabi MC reel off the lyrics in a way that's tight and fresh. The Hindi effects in the background give the track an exotic feel... A good listen (even better if you could understand/translate what Panjabi MC's saying!)."
5,wonderful,"this is really great for cleaning out your arteries. i will be on it forever. i recommend it to everyone.,"
3,Heavy,"This is a great racquet for kids, in terms of size, construction, and materials, but I wish it was lighter. It weighs 135grms, which is as much as my adult lightweight racquet weighs. Adult racquets can weigh from 220 to 120 grams so this would be on the light side, except that being a child's racquet, and hence smaller, I would expect it to be lighter. Mind you lighter is up to a point a question of preferences. Some adults prefer heavier racquets because of the added power the additional mass brings to the stroke, and I imagine you could make the same argument for children's racquets. My 9 year old son is playing just fine with this racquet, but if I had to do things over I would have bought something lighter, like a Dunlop."
2,DVD Barato,"Lo mejor son las selectiones de la canciones ,todos exitos. El audio es un 8 de 10. Lo que no perdono es la mala calidad del video visual. Tanto dinero que el artista ha producido y no pueden sacarle una presentacion en un esenario que valga la pena.Este producto es solo para fanaticos.Un ponto meno para la Bachata."
3,starfarers stuck in the middle,"Vonda McIntyre's background as a geneticist gives us the explanation of the title of this book, being the stationary, poised to move, section of the trilogy. On its own it doesn't have the impact of her other books, but it's the essential link for this series, with distinctly psychedelic overtones!"
2,The Most Superfluous Book in the Series,"The Starfarers series is not without its merits, but Metaphase is where it grinds to a virtual standstill. Although one or two minor ideas pop up here and there, most of the book is spent on rather dull character interaction.The plot is not really going anywhere at all in this installation, and could easily have been boiled down to one or two chapters in the next book.You're left with the distinct impression that the author was paid by the page."
4,it rocks,"best ping pong table in this country.I fell on top of it, and it didn't even creak or bend!!!"
4,Simple and effective design,This table came in one package. The only setup needed was to assemble the central rolling part and lift the two halves onto it. Then attach plastic protectors over the corners. It took about 30 minutes. Great design! The table had been a pleasure since then.The only problem I have had with it are a few screws on the railing were stripped out. One edge was loose. The little protectors that go on the corners were a little challenging at first. Should have waited until the table was fully assembled and then hit them with my palm to get them to snap into place. Eventually that's what worked.It's definitely weather ready...Would definitely recommend this table to a friend.
2,Nice table... while it lasts,"We loved this table for the single summer we were able to use it. Even with storage in the garage through the fall, winter, and spring, the surface began to delaminate and bubble, rendering the table useless. It was a tremendous waste of money for our family."
4,Highly satisfactory table,"Our Stiga outdoor table arrived only two weeks ago, so this is a preliminary review. But it arrived in good shape (no factory or shipping dings), was easy to assembly (unlike some tables), and appears well constructed. Surfaces line up perfectly, table response is uniform, structure appears strong and stable, blue surface provides good visibility contrast for ball. Altogether, a good table for kids and nonprofessional adults. It's too early to assess durability in semi-outdoor conditions (screened porch) in South Carolina near beach, but it's off to a good start."
1,Don't buy it,I bought a very similar Stiga table made by Escalade. After one season the aluminum top started peeling away from the rest of the table. Escalade was no help at all.
5,JUST MY OPINION,"THIS IS BASIC. ANYTHING ELECTRONIC THAT IS CONNECTED VIA CABLE OF SOME SORT OR ANOTHER CAN USE A GOOD QUICK SHOT. AND IT WILL MAKE A DEFERENCE FROM SPEAKER CABLE TO HDMI TO WHAT IS THAT....??? CABLE. at first i thought yea right. But I seen it with my own eyes. SO DON'T BE SCARED, AND IF YOUR SET UP OF WHAT EVER HAS BEEN TOGETHER FOR A YEAR OR 2 OR 3 OR MORE, take it apart and DEOXIT. THANKS."
5,Magic connection enhancer fluid,"This substance will rescue old equipment by restoring good connections between metal contacts. It is amazingly effective and lasting. I have avoided hardware replacement on several old computers by spraying the connectors for CPU, memory, and card connectors. It has proved effective on a wide variety of electronic and automotive equipment. My first can lasted about 10 years so far, and this is my second can that I bought to keep in reserve when the first can runs out someday. The physics of connection enhancers make an interesting read. They exploit the phenomenon of ""tunneling"" that expidites electron movement between poorly contacting metals. Try this stuff on an old flashlight and you will be surprised how bright it becomes."
1,Are they serious!!!,"This cd is perhaps a little disturbing to some viewers. If I could give it zero stars I would have. This is a collection of angry women, for one reason or another. Will not make this mistake again. I'd rather purchase a cheap porn with girls only, Im sure I'd learn more."
1,blah,not at all something to watch more than once. not what expedited.very boring. women not very attractive
5,One of The Greatest Trio's Ever!!,"If you've ever wondered where the light sound in jazz came from, here it is. Miles Davis cites Ahmad Jamal as one of his primary influences. This is what confident, un-self-conscious jazz sounds like. Listening to this album is an experience not easily forgotten. With all the talk about pianists like Bill Evans and Oscar Peterson, Jamal's minimalist approach to jazz piano is like a cool breeze. So, take a breath"
5,A great album and a great bargain,"What you get here are two chock-full CDs of the best of Ahmad Jamal's trio output during the late 50s and early 60s. Maybe his absolute best output, period.Ahmad plays smoothly, melodically, adding quirky interpretations of the melody a little at a time. Sometimes he improvises by subtracting, leaving out notes or lines instead of cluttering things up with lots of notes. Then, out of nowhere will come lightning fast runs or accented notes, struck loud and proud. This is the excitement of the Ahmad Jamal Trio. Melody. Space. Silence. Surprise. Delight!This collection also contains 3/4 of the classic album Live At The Pershing -- you don't absolutely need that album if you have this one -- the essential stuff is here.Cross Country Tour is on my personal list of the 100 best albums of all time. The recording quality is a little dodgy here and there, but you can't beat the music. It has had replay after replay in my house for years."
5,Classical Loon,"Great CD. The call of the loon never overpowers or even distracts from the music.Very relaxing, have drifted off to sleep many a night at the cottage to the beautiful music and mood of this CD."
1,Very disappointing,I did not like this book at all. The author depicts Holmes and Watson as if they hated each other and I found myself wondering if the author had ever actually read any of the orignal stories. My only recommedation would: Avoid this book.
2,A road too long,"This was a very confusing book -- at least for this reader. Too much of the time, I didn't know exactly what was going on -- and some of the time when I did understand, it was only because I'd seen the film version (most of which was different from the book). One section of the book comprised about 40 pages of one of the character's nightmares, which, eventually, I just skipped over.I had liked the film version (starring Rock Hudson and Burl Ives) so much, and I had enjoyed Hartog's ""The Fourposter"" and I must say I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe sometime I'll re-read it and may understand it better the next time around. As it now stands, I would not recommend it."
4,entertaining drama by very talented writer,"Just got around to reading this--and I was pleasantly surprised. I found this a well-written, interesting, insightful novel. Better written than many courtroom novels today. Good background on courtroom stuff, without being pedantic."
3,"Not a GREAT book, but okay...","I love Darian North's books--BUT...this wasn't her best. I thought that it was way to drawn out, and frankly I felt that the courtroom parts were extremely boring. The premise was good, although somewhat unbelievable, but it was just somehow lacking, in my humble opinion. But I WON'T give up on new Darian North books!"
3,It was OK,I enjoyed this book but I thought it was too long and not very suspenseful. It could have ended a lot sooner that it did. Don't expect too much excitement from this one.
2,A string gave out,"Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top. A few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end. Overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long. I will replace with 12s however. For me the 11s felt a little loose. The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box. I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model. I'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s."
5,great sound,"I have been using fender flats because they are the only ones avaiable at my local music store.These DeAddario strings are so much better. I play an Ibanez archtop. These tend toward the treble as opposed to Gibsons which have more of the classic jazz midrange. Because of this my guitar is somewhat noisy, as is common to Ibanez. The DeAddario strings maintain the natural tone of the guitar (including the desirable shimmer), and yet completly eliminate the noise."
5,The best flat wouind electric guitar strings!!!,"Without getting really expensive, this strings sound great (I needed flat wounds for my guitar) sound fantastic and last a long time."
1,Stand breaks easily,"The stands of the speakers break easily. Creative Labs will give you hard time replacing the stand, and will charge you almost the cost of a new speaker."
4,An amazing pair set of speaker systems,"Don't get deceived off the size, if you are looking out for good speakers. Though small in size, the speakers are amazing in terms of output sound. I am still not able to use the full output of it, because till now with almost 60% of the volume used, its more than enough to ""Wake thy Neighbours""The subwoofer is a good too.All in all, an amazing thing to buy."
5,Great speakers,I bought these speakers as an upgrade for my computer. My old speakers had a subwoofer and they sounded ok. I was really surprised at the quality and dynamic range of sound with the Creative I-Trigue 2.1. I'm a gamer and love the sound I get now; I had no idea what I was missing. I have been into music for many years and they work just as well for tunes too. One draw back is I have to keep the volume down late at night since I have a roommate. The volume control with headphone plug is handy as well. You will be surprised at the RUNBLE these speakers produce.
5,Huzza for Bolitho,"It's a very good book in a very good series. For some reason, it just keeps getting sadder, but I like it anyway. This one's quite so sad yet, but it's getting there. Also, there's an important character with the same name as me, and that's always fun, unless that person dies. Then it's kind of scary. I liked Bolitho better when he was younger, though. He's happier. Read it. You'll enjoy it."
2,Better than Hornblower,"After reading this I agree that Kent's story is better than the Hornblower novels.But is that saying much?This is still schoolboy stuff.You can get just as much action and adventure on the high seas, but well written with real backbone and depth reading the work of Patrick O'Brian.Do yourself a favour naval history fans and google PATRICK O'BRIAN"
3,Pretty decent blender,"Bought this to replace the worst blender ever created (Villaware's Smoothee Bar), and it is ok. It does not have any trouble blending frozen fruit or ice properly, and it never leaks. The carafe attaches firmly to the base and is easy to remove when you're ready to pour your drink into a glass. I haven't really tried many of the onboard recipes, but the few I have tried worked out well. Overall, it's a decent blender...but does anyone really use that recipe feature? If you really need that, it's worth the money. Otherwise, I'd be happier with a normal blender."
1,ok let me explain,I spent full price on the blender with great hopes. Just got married and wished to take home a perfect electrono-digital machine my lady would take pleasure using.It stopped working on the third day. All we could ever make using this was a solitary banana shake with honey.
3,Diary of a worm is the BEST ONE EVER!!!,"Dear,Reader if you are wondering what is Diary of a Worm. It is the Best book EVER!!! It has very good drawing. Its good for all ages. You can tell the story just by the pictures. I think it should have won the Caldecott Medal for 1st place. So if you havent read the book Diary of a Worm i think you should read it. Mabe even read it Every day because it is so GOOD!!!"
3,Why Play on Fears,"The author and illustrator are both terrific in imagination and talent. My only criticism is in the one part that plays on children's minds in a negative way. We are told that there are ""three reasons"" that it is good to be a worm - 1- you don't have to worry about tracking in mud (Fine - that's fun!); 2 - you don't have to take a bath (but kids love baths, until we start to instill this cultural idea that one should resist taking a bath ); and 3 - you don't have to go to the dentist (this is really annoying. Children are so afraid of dentists as it is, why make it worse) Surely there could be 2 other items for this scenerio besides dentists and baths. Just my opinion and, yes, it may be a cultural norm for kids views, but why botch an otherwise fun book. Not for me."
2,Stereotypes revisited,"We bought this book on the strength of the good reviews. We agree that there is delightful humour in there, and we like the pictures, too.But, if you are at all sensitive to gender stereotyping, you should NOT buy this book. When you write a book about worms, which are hermaphroditic after all, you should at least be able to sidestep some of the traditional role-play shown here: the boy worm who wants to do a dangerous job for heroic reasons, the sister worm who looks into a puddle-mirror and is ridiculed by her brother, the strict ugly female teacher and the cool male art teacher..For adults, that might pass as satire. But not for kids.This book could have been delightful as a whole. As it is, we find it embarrassing at best, nauseating if you think of reading it to a girl.A pity."
3,It's ok,It's an OK book. I really think moms and dads would getsome of the humor better than the child will.
5,Wonderful book!,I love the diary concept and the fact that the story seems like a scrapbook. We bought the Diary of a Spider first and then wanted to get this one. It has real information in it and also it is really fun to read. I would add that I think Diary of a Spider is better--but this one is good too. It is cool to have both because the worm and the spider are friends and to see the connections between the two characters is neat. My son loves that about these two books. Why is Diary of a Fly so darn expensive? I would love to get that one too!
5,diary of a worm,"This story was about a little worm and his family.The story is the little worm goes to school,andhe eats his homework.I liked this story because it`s about a worm that goes to school."
5,Down the Worm Hole,"Diary of a Worm by Doreen Cronin follows the day to day life of a little earthworm. We learn about his daily adventures, his family and friend, a spider. Some of the humor will be appreciated by adults. Another great book for parents and teachers to introduce to their children. When the spring and summer arrives, take you child out worm hunting! The author, Doreen Cronin, also has another book entitled Diary of a Spider. It's equally as enjoyable."
5,You may want to keep it for yourself,"I found this book so engaging I almost didn't want to part with it. Fortunately, I love the child I bought it for enough to share. It's clever and sweet and very amusing. The illustrations are very well done."
5,Diary of a Worm,Arrived on time and in great condition. Every kid should own this book-this is my 8th copy to give to friends with kids. (Don't buy the sequels)
4,A worm has a diary!,"Worm's diary is hilarious fun to read. Doreen Cronin has a winner here. Bug fans may also likeThe Bugville Critters Visit Dad and Mom at Work (Buster Bee's Adventures Series #1, The Bugville Critters)."
3,DIARY of A worm!!!!!,This book is good for all ages. This is a very funny book that many kids and adults will enjoy. Diary of a Worm is about a worm and his life and some things that happen in his life. He has a friend that is a spider that adds a great touch to the book. The illustrations are also very bright and colorful and explain the book with out even needing words. This book is very enjoyable and is good for reading when ever you feel like it.
3,Niiiiiice,"Even though Diary of a Worm may not be good enough for the Caldecott Award, it is a very creative book. Many books are not as creative as this one. I think many adults & children will love this one of a kind, vivid book. Great illustrations and humor!"
5,Great Service,The book was ordered for Christmas and I got it 5 days before Christmas and I ordered it realy late for Christmas but I still got it.
5,My son loves this book,"Although we've had to alter the title to ""journal of the worn"" as my son kept using the word diarhea rather than diary - love the book, though!"
5,Diary of a Worm,I liked the Diary of a Worm. I like the worm on the book. Its the coolest book I've ever seen. The book the Diary of a worm is cool. The book is funny. The best part is when he puts his head in and out. It was funny. I loved the Diary of a Worm. It was so funny.
4,A Worm's Day,"The book describes a day in the life of a worm. He goes to school. He had dreams of being a secret service agent. In addition, their parents taught them good manners and they have problems like ordinary people, Yet, the story has no plot, but I think children would enjoy the life of a worm."
4,Nice Fan,"Nice fan, better than any I found locally. Easy to put together, good airflow. The description is flawed though. It says aluminum blades but they are plastic."
1,Not As Advertised,"The Windchaser fan captioned above is for crap!It is NOT Industrial!It does not meet industrial standards to be called ""Industrial""!The item was to have aluminum blades. Mine arrived with plastic!What kind of false advertising are you guys trying to pull?"
3,solid basics but was it proof read?,"I have been working on embedded communications for about 7 years now and must say - so far so good. Much of the information is this book is good for people that have not done this before or are new in their career. There is a lot of valuable information and this would work well as a primer. Having said that the proof reading is terrible - some stuff could have been caught by a spell checker! Some examples of errors that made it into publication:Letters missing at the end of a sentence like ""TCP is an example of a stateful protoco."" (which is a direct quote from the book).A sentence ending with two periods (yes '..'!).And a white space character being swapped with the last character of the preceeding word making both the first and second word different; for example ""cars how"" becomes ""car show"".Whoever was responsible for that should be fired! I am surprised the publisher is not embarrassed by the quality of the proof reading."
4,Good Introductory Book with a bad Editor,The book is quite interesting and could be quite useful for anyone begining to programcomm software. In my case it provided an interesting insight into the workings of carrier gradeequipment software I'm currently studying an especialization on Telecomunications and my focus is more onthe overall design of Data Networks rather than that of the equipment.The one thing that I found disappointing with the book was the numerous spelling mistakes that went passthe proofreader.
5,Reference book for embedded communication software developer,"This is a very good book providing overview of all the issues that a fresh engineer should consider when developing software for embedded communication equipment.The Chapters on Tables and Other Data Structures and Buffer and Timer Management are particularly insightful and provide good details of the different techniques adopted - a good reference material. The Chapter on Mutli-Board Communications Software Desgin provides a good summary of the options in hardware design for communication equipment - good for beginners to understand the environment where their software would be executing.The language used and the approach the author has taken in introducing a problem and analysing the different techniques to solve the problem is very direct maintaining the focus on the topic.Overall, a good addition to the library of a technical person."
5,Very Good book !!!,"I love this book, its really great !! Its a very good reference for people working in embedded communication software design. It touches upon all major topics involved in communication software design. The author gives a very clear, concise and in-depth treatment of various design techniques.Would definitely recommend !!"
1,How a translation should NOT be done,"It is true that this is one of the three foundation texts of Chinese traditional medicine. Why, then, would the author find it necessary to add foot notes ""correcting"" the text. TCM biases were used in order to make these corrections. There were numerous places that footnotes could have been added to explain why characters and groups of characters were translated the way they were. This was completely absent. The original Chinese is not included as it is by serious academics such as Wiseman and Unschuld. Much of the information was combined with more modern information nonexistant at the time of the Ben Cao. This translation is arrogant and dishonest. I use it as an example of how not to interpret the classics in my courses."
5,The Root of Chinese Herbal Medicine,"The Divine Farmer's Materia Medica Classic,the first English translation of Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, provides the perfect historical foundation for my study of Chinese herbal medicine. The book is written clearly and concisely; it removes the veil that has been covering the root of Chinese herbal medicine. The book is organized logically, and it includes a table of contents, insertions within the text, and a commentary that makes the meaning clear. Additionally,the book has a general index and medicinal indices in both Latin and pinyin, which makes it easy to find a specific herb, in the text. I am very pleased to make this book a permanent part of my personal library."
3,Not a historical reference,"Let's be clear about what this book is and what it is not...The back cover of the book presents itself as a translation of one of the ""foundation books"" for the contemporary practitioner of TCM. This it is. The editors overreach, however, in asserting that this book is of value to studying the ""historical roots of Chinese medicine"" and ""the Taoist contribution to Chinese medicine."" While the book may provide some value to the contemporary practitioner of TCM wishing to get an overall sense of his/her ""roots"" by reading the contents of the Shennong bencao jing, this is not a book with much value for historical research as the footnotes are based on contemporary TCM practice. The biggest problem, however, is the lack of Chinese characters and the (incomprehensible to me) omission of an index of Chinese plant-names or symptoms. For me, these omissions make the book unusable as even a basic reference."
2,Bad rip off of Misery,This movie is predictibly similar to Misery without any suspense or interesting plot developments. The box art for this movie is also misleading as it shows a girl locked up in a small cage. In fact it is simply a spacious jail cell that some crooked cop has in his basement. A made for Showtime movie.
2,Dismal Film about a Cop Who is Off His Hinges,"I watched this during my lunch break the other day. I would have been farther ahead to go back to work early. Dennis Hopper plays Lieutenant Krebs, a crazy cop who kidnaps a stripper and torments her with psychological warfare for months. No one suspects that the cop is a kidnapper because of his popular public image with children (he does puppet shows which encourage kids to say no to drugs and no to crime).The film is slow and sluggish, and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I kept thinking, ""When will the woman try to escape? When will her family and friends start looking for her? Why did this nutty cop kidnap her to begin with?""Misey was a a much better movie if you are interested in the psycho-kidnapper thing."
1,zzzzzz,"Well, i didn't expect mcuh when I read the DVD case and I wasn't disapointed. I should have gone with my first impression and not wasted the time. It was bad. Especially the point system. That was so unbelievably close to reality in behavioral modification programs...well, don't bother with this one."
4,Simple,"It charges the battery for my ratchet quickly and efficiently, the cord is sturdy and long. The indicator light is a helpful feature. I have no complaints."
2,Not for landowners,"I own farm land that is being leased to gas drillers. I thought that this book included material on what is in a lease contract, how to negotiate with drillers and other issues framed for a land owners situation. Not. It's for potential investors, not landowners.Paul"
2,Average quality for a very high cost,"This book would be ok if it cost $25. But at $65, i expected much more.First of all, the physical construction of the book is shoddy. My first book had pages falling out all over the place. Amazon replaced it but the construction does not allow you to hold open on a page unless you want to risk pages coming loose and falling out.The editing is poor.It is good for a general overview of the oil and gas industry, but spends too much time on historical facts and not enough on the current day situation and modern technologies.I will admit that i haven't read other O&G; books so i have little basis for comparison. That said, I would guess that you could find equal or better quality at a much lower price."
2,"Long and drawn out, difficult to follow","Having not only read the book but having taken Dr. Knapp's Contemporary Sociological Theory Class I can honestly say that his book is much like his class. Knapp has a tendency to ramble about a topic. he is a very intelligent man, however his ability to convey this material to the reader and the student is extremely tedious."
4,I was forced to read this book...,"...and I enjoyed it. This was one of 8 required books in my college U.S. History 1865-present class. Yes, there are a lot of facts. There are a lot of facts I did not know and I am grateful they were in there. I think Cashman did a good job covering the time period. And to the people that said this book was boring, bad, whatever.....get used to it. If your going to take college courses in history, you need to have an open mind. Without that, you'll never succeed in college and beyond."
2,Reads like a long winded text book,"I stopped reading this only a few pages in. I'm just not enjoying it. I love this era in American history, but I was hoping this book was a little ""fluffier."" Not a fun read at all.I'd be glad to sell it to any of you....cheap!"
1,Superficial and defective,"I found Cashman's book on America in the Gilded Age to be rather superficial and poorly organized. Although I purchased the third edition (1993), I noticed that the references had not been updated since the first edition (1984), making the book less up to date than one would expect. Finally, the copy that I received was physically defective - pages 77-108 were missing, and pages 109-140 were duplicated."
2,A Good Book For School,"This book is great if you want to know everything there is to know about the gilded age, but it is really boring! It reads just like a texbook, so if that's what you're looking for, go for it! I certainly woudn't reccomend it for any light reading."
2,"Boring, drab, and uneventful.","I guess anybody who enjoys reading about American history, and the way life was back in the day, they'd appreciate this book. All it is, is a compilation of facts, where the author tries to keep out his own opinion, thus preventing biased judgements made on the readers' part. Since I was required to read this book for my AP American history course, I was would not go strolling down a library isle and pick this book off of the shelf... I do not recommend wasting your time and/or money on this pathetic attempt at writing."
2,Far from acceptable,"This seal looked as if it had been cut out by someones dog chewing on it. Compared to the old one I took out, which was 15yrs old it looked like crap. I honestly wouldn't have accepted it, but it was in the package like this and not the sellers fault. I needed it, and didn't have time to wait for another. Would recommend getting your seal from some other manufacturer."
1,"Tiresome,tedious, and over-complicated","This is the second (and last) J. Kellerman book I've read. The plot is tedious, dragging on forever. There are far too many characters, none of them interesting or well-developed. I had a pretty good idea whom the killer was as soon as the character was introduced, but the story -- such as it is -- just meandered on forever. I had to skip ahead -- skip all the tiresome descriptions Kellerman muddles his book with -- to get to the end. Boring! And poorly written. I liked the dog, so the book gets one star from me. Give me Patricia Cornwell anyday."
2,"OK Book, but nothing I would recommend","I just finished reading ""Bad Love"" by Jonathon Kellerman and I must say I wasn't all that impressed. It was the second book of his that I read and I liked the first one much better. This book just took too long for me to get interested in it. The last 100 pages I read pretty fast, but before that I kept debating whether or not to finish it because it was so slow and I couldn't keep the 300 different names seperated! I was so confused as to who they were talking about. The little dog was the best part of the book. The dog made me want to go out and buy a dog for myself! He was so sweet. But other than that, it wasn't that great of a book."
4,Great book,"This is one of his best books to date, I believe. I have read many of his ""Alex Delaware"" books, and am now reading them in order. This is a much better way to read any author's ""series"" books. I did the same for his wife, Faye Kellerman, and found I enjoyed them (Decker/Lazerus) much more. I wish he had a more variety of book-to-book characters. He seems to only have Sturgis and Robin (and the dog, of course) that are carried forward in each book - and Robin comes and goes, without much in-put into what the book is about. His wife, Faye, has at least 8 different characters who are carried forwared, and you always look forward to what someone is gong to do....they may not all be in each book, but at least they are a known commodity when they do show up. I do enjoy the Delaware series and am now over half way through the series....."
2,how to ruin a book for me,"I would say this is an average book for its type, which I don't usually read. But I was intrigued by the description on the back cover and started it. It is a fairly good read, the author seems to know his stuff, but WAIT!!Right there in chapter 22, ""Steen was on his knees by a chalk body outline"".Excuse me? A chalk body outline? I have not seen that since a bad 1930's gangster film, and even then I don't believe the police were really using them. There is something called a ""camera"" that they use to memorialize the crime scene.One error like that and I now have my doubts about Mr. Kellerman's skill."
5,"""Bad Love"" is simply Kellerman at his best","""Bad love. Bad love. Don't give me the bad love...""It all starts with this haunting audio cassette message, which leaves Alex Delaware feeling greatly disturbed.Having read a number of Kellerman's novels, ""Bad Love"" secures a high spot on my shortlist of the author's finest works. Owing to a finely-tuned story, a suspenseful plot and an intriguing set of characters, this book is a page-turner from beginning to end.In ""Bad Love"", Jonathan Kellerman shows us once again why he is among the best in the genre."
2,Bad Love - Bad Book,"Bad Love is well written with good characters but the plot develops very slowly. Many readers, including myself, may consider the plot tedious. Great book to keep beside your bed in case you need something to lull you to sleep."
4,A Good Page-turner in the Alex Delaware Series,"This book is a very good page-turner. Alex Delaware, psychologist and sleuthextraordinaire, looks for a sociopathic murderer who scrawls 'Bad Love' at thescene of his murders. The investigation centers on findig someone with agrudge against a now-dead psychoanalyst who, we find out, is really a sicko-analyst.This is a great book for vacation, the beach or airplane."
1,Trash,"A trashy tough talking A->B->C waste of rainforrest. It is easy to loose interest in this book as your groan whether to turn another page or toss it into the bin. Everything in this book seems forced the characters are uncharasmatic, dry and seem like mere vehicles to trash out another banal murder-mystery plot."
2,Not so much love for Bad Love,"I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book."

4,I DISAGREE WITH THE LAST REVIEW,"I thought the book was delightful. The directions for each design are extremely clear, which is NOT always the case with origami books. One great design is a sticky note take on a flexagon, which works very well since the paper comes with its own stickiness -- no transparent tape required. The models are relatively easy (till the last few), so this would be a good book for an origami novice. An experienced folder might want to take a look at a copy before purchasing."
4,nice gift for the cubical dweller,"I bought this for a sibling who worked in a cubical office with computers. As anyone who works in computers knows there are times when you just have to sit there waiting for the computer to finish ""thinking"". According to my sibling this was a great little thing to keep their hands and mind busy when they would have otherwise been bored stiff without it taking away from the job at hand.Have a friend or family who works in a cubical? Keep this in mind for their birthday."
3,"Origami, maybe, but not too original","I was a little disappointed in this book. I was expecting more original pieces, and using the sticky part of the paper in new ways. I was able to make all of the pieces the first time--no real challenge. I may have to put my mind to it and send the author some suggestions!"
5,Hmmm..,"To be honest, besides a graphic male (...) scene, i dont really see why this movie wasn't released in the states. It really wasn't THAT graphic. Great childrens movie."
1,Not for me.,I guess I am not as open minded as I thought. I found this film to be disturbing. Although the mechanics of the film are well done I gave this film one star due to the content. This film found itself in the garbage before the end of the film. Perhaps I am too old fashion to enjoy this film. I would not recommend this film.
1,What is the viewer supposed to take away from this?,"This is more of Larry Clark's nihilistic shock-trash. Everyone in Ken Park, just like everyone in Bully and Kids, is a sex-obsessed lowlife with no conscience. The characters commit murder, adultery, you name it, with no guilt or second thoughts.Nothing motivates the characters but base pleasures. We see them getting high and screwing around, but never talking about what they want to do after high school. They don't talk about music, sports, or skateboarding--nothing above the wasteline seems to interest them.Near the end of the film, one of the characters, Claude, talks about about a book that describes his version of utopia: an island where the inhabitants do nothing but have sex all day. This is the film's great failing. The characters are not just immoral; they are boring. They are too shallow to be shocking. Ken Park is pornography trying to pass itself off as edgy film-making."
2,ken park,"I thought it was going to be a new copy,But when it got to me it was a burned copy.It worked but still looked not the best quality.In the future please tell people that it is a duplicate and not a new copy."
3,Could have been a lot better,"I won't bore you with what the movie is all about, other reviewers have done that, and I don't see the point adding to what has been comprehensively covered. For myself, I was disappointed with the movie. I thought the subject matter was an excellent topic, adolescence, the problems of teenagers growing up, etc etc., and felt a lot more could have been done with it I felt the producers only scratched the surface of their topic, and although I watched the complete movie, I found it pretty boring. Sure there were a few higlights, the kid having oral sex with his girlfriends mother, who was a bit of a babe, and the threesome at the end, but it takes a lot more than that to keep my interest in a movie."
2,Porno with a Plot,"Larry Clark has taken extreme to a whole new level with Ken Park. He has surpassed Kids, Bully and every other film he's made with this. This has to be his 'sickest' film yet. I had to watch this with japanese language over english so it was kind of hard to understand all the words but this piece of work takes 'clark' to a whole new level. It has a man who touches his son, a kid who commits suicide, a scene with a kid, a knife and his grandparents that truly disturbed the hell out of me and much much more. There is full frontal nudity for both sexes and its just a lot more extreme than Kids or anything else hes done. I wasnt really feeling this one just from what I saw. This will shock you."
2,I have thought that it did not need to see.,"Although it was a movie made to consider many things, I feel that there were also quite a many unnecessary scenes."
3,Gritty,"Ken Park is a gritty psychotic movie (what do you expect from Clark) It has good acting by a bunch of unknowns, and the plot is simple but still carries a big punch. It's interesting to watch just for the shock factor. Ken Park is an exageration of the bordem on the Central Valley."
4,Exhibitionism,This film is a good plot mild porno in its uncut uncensored edition. We see a good looking blonde showing her naked body like an exhibitionist and getting her pussy ate. We see some threesomes and a guy jacking off to climax and it shows a big eruption showing this guy is an exhibitionist like in regular adult films. The sad part is it should have been more explicit which would have made it a better porno.
2,"Strong premise/subject, poor execution","Was intrigued by the premise and subject of this movie. Although the characters in this movie aren't in my demographic, i am older, I had expectations of the movie. Unfortunately, for me, the acting was underwhelming and the execution was poor with no inventive cinematography. Didn't feel moved by this movie. Brick, one of my favorite movies, is a much better and more innovative film."
1,not exciting,"not what you will expect from the cover, the story line is all over the place, and the only great scene is at the end, too many men and not enough women shown"
2,ken park,"I wanted to know before if the video was in russian,first,then and english languages i m black and speach english and french so..."
5,Ken Park,"One of the most enjoyable, near ture to life movies I have seen in some time. I really don""t know how this got by me when it first came to be. I highly recomend this movie, % out of % stars.The young actors in this movie are excellent!! Thanks, all my friends are getting this movie for Christmas."
1,beware of shipping costs,"i bought this dvd from a seller called SERGE,it was advertised at $12.77.my credit card showed a total cost of $47.63.!!!!I was charged $34.86 for expedited shipping which i didnt ask for.I have since been told that many sellers make their money this way,if you are not buying from amazon direct be very careful about associated costs.ps the film is just teen sexploitation and the print is not that great."
3,Ken Park-It and Leave It,"Ken Park is gritty and raw, much like ""Kids"", but not quite as extreme as ""Gummo"". The subject matter is not especially groundbreaking, but the explicit sex scenes give the film shock value and legendary status. See this film if you're curious, but if you've ever been to an adult website you've already seen the bulk of what Ken Park has to offer. If you have trouble finding a copy of the DVD, check the online auction sites (that's where I got mine)."
2,Ken Park movie,"There's really no point to this movie other than drugs and getting naked. I guess that was my fault for not reading the back though haha, Im sure a lot of others will enjoy this though!"
1,Ken Park (Uncut Uncensored NTSC Region Free!) [DVD] Larry Clark,BE CAREFUL!! There is NO region 1 out there. I bought the Russian one that should play on a region 1 player and it didn't work. The Russian one also comes with subtitles. I returned mine.
2,Dumb movie,"First off let me say the transaction was great, Item arrived fast and in excellent condition, so big ups to the seller. But this was the stupidest movie I ever watched. Nothing made sense whatsoever. Larry Clark delivered a classic in the Movie ""Kids"" and the movie ""Another day in paradise."" So I was interested in some of his other projects. But Ken Park is just a insane and very perverted movie. More like a strange porno. Alot of things happpen with no explanation as to why. Murder of loving grandparents, a dad's perverted obsession with his son, an unexplainable suicide to begin the movie. Just a very sick movie."
3,basicaly porn,"So there really is no story line to this movie at all. At least the director's other movies had a story to tell. I think this time all he wanted to do is to see how many of the characters he could get to have sex on film. It really is just basically pornography. I'm not just talking a little nudity here and there, it shows full sexual acts including being able to see oral and penetration. I have no problem with nudity personally but come on, if you want a porno, go get one. By the way the actors are very strange and young looking."
1,Boring.,"Very disappointed with this movie. Most of the reviews sounded promising. The movie sucked!!!! So after wasted $10, we decided to order Playboy Channel for $16 a month. Now thats adult Entertainment!!!"
1,Not pleased,"Heard a lot about the movie and was looking forward to seeing it. Then I got the dvd...could not play in my dvd player...Not sure why, so I watched it on my computer. Only to find someone had taken out all the nasty or blurred it out. I would of liked the movie much better if I could of seen it without the cuts and it would have been nice to see it on my tv..."
1,Works beautifully when it works :(,"It died today (2/11/06). Barely 90 days over covered warrenty (labor anyway, part's cover for a year). It worked bautifully... One of the best picture quality I've ever seen for less than $300... But doesn't matter when it dies so early. This is my first panasonic product and didn't leave a very good impression on my. I've always said Sony made some infirior products. So I want out and bought a Panasonic. What a mistake. As good as flush money down the drain. At least Sony products last... I would never touch an other Panasonic product ever again."
4,Whast the deal with the release date,"This dvd player is listed on PANASONIC.COM (U.K)for Release in Europe on 11/04.So maybe the USA release date is soon to follow. The delay has been because there have been recalls of some new players(Toshiba 5960)with the HDMI connection. I am interested in this model because of the MPEG Video Noise reduction. Which for some dumb reason, Panasonic put only in thier (FIVE) DVD changer PANASONIC(DVD-S87S) but not in any of thier new single disc DVD Players. This model was listed in catalog and web sites for release in the USA on JUNE 2004. Although emails I received from PANASONIC claim this model was never intended for release in the USA."
2,Surprise-Doesn't play HD DVDs!,"So I read the glowing Amazon reviews listing all the various media the S97S can handle and said to myself--""This is clearly the best DVD player around. Jeez, it can play anything but a 45 rpm record!"" Hooked it up to the new flat panel TV and eagerly ordered some HD DVD's from Netflix. Gathered friends, popped popcorn and told them to fasten their seatbelts in preparation for a visual treat--""Apollo 13"" in glorious High Definition! Slipped the DVD in and there was a long delay as it whirred and stopped and started and then came the message ""Can't Play Disc."" I guess I should've been more aware of the format war in which I had just become an unwitting casualty. Hope this review will save someone from the bad investment this Netflix fan has made in the wrong player..."
5,Panasonic has done it again.....,"I have resisted buying the other models that have the HDMI just so I can get the Panasonic. And it was worth it. I have the Panasonic 53"" TV with the HDMI interface and all I can say is WOW. My DVD's never look so good. I have not tried all the features but I will get around to it. I will be watching the MATRIX again on this bad boy. It takes some setting up on the DVD but once you have it all set, you are good. The Manual is a little cryptic so you may need your 6 year old to help you or a Phd."
4,Great DVD Player!!!!,"I own a 43"" Pioneer Elite Plasma Monitor, when I plugged the DVD Panasonic S97S via the HDMI connection the highest 1080i resolution was in use, the result.... a crisp, high detail HD image. It does the same work of any high-end brand with a fraction of the cost. The only reason I didn't gave the 5 Stars was because of the materials they used on the unit, is too light, too fragile and the disk tray give you the sensation that it could be broken with a whisper. However, the design is very good, it's very slim and it has a blue indigo light a la Harman-Kardon style.Bottom Line: Don't spend the big bucks, buy this unit and you may also buy 15 or 20 full priced DVDs and still spending less.Max"
3,Was great for a year but now it overheats,"I loved my old panasonic DVD player for 5 years, but when the spinning wheel finally broke, I decided it was time to buy a new machine. After a lot of research I purchased this one. For about 8 months it works perfectly, but then I started to notice some strange behavior. The picture blanks out about 3/4s through a normal length movie. You can still hear the sound and if you press the audio only a few times, the picture comes back, but the color is distorted. I changed the cables to make sure this wasn't a non DVD problem. As another reviewer mentioned, the machine gets VERY hot and I'm fairly sure this is the problem. Once the thing is turned off for 5 minutes, the picture comes back looking normal. This is pretty dissapointing as I havent' had it that long and my other machine lasted me for 5 years.(Also, the fact the remote doesn't have an open/close button bugs me a lot)."
4,DVD player that is still ticking,No longer in use but it never went out on me. BOught it for a gem way back when but it is still working though don't have many DVDs to actually play on it. Good Quality product. Recommended.
2,"Worked well, then died abruptly","The picture quality was great, but this Panasonic DVD player lasted me barely 2 years. One day it got glitchy, then the next day to the point where it wouldn't even turn on anymore. Not what I'd expect out of a DVD player well over $200. Also, the biggest drawback to this player is the fact that you can't see how many minutes into the movie you are, only what chapter you're on. So if you want to take the DVD out and continue watching it on your laptop or another DVD player, good luck skipping straight to the part where you stopped."
1,Panasonic couldn't locate a replacement part.,"I surely wouldn't reccomend buying this dinosaur. Bought it online and it never did work. Panasonic ""support"" was as bad as it's DVD. One support specialist told me to unplug it and then plug it in again. Another was reading from a list of ""What to do if the caller says this."" The repair shop gave me the idea that Panasonic no longer makes this product. They couldn't find a replacement part so they are replacing my DVD. In all I've waited over a month and a half to watch my $299 DVD player and I still haven't got a new one from the repair shop. If your smart don't purchase one of these antiques."
5,sublime,Great clear sound that really captures the traditonal to pop/swing tension that informs some of the best classic small band Hawaiian music. Works as campy fun as well as excellently-played music. Highly recommended.
3,You get what you pay for,"Since my old mp3 player broke, I bought this one to temporarily take to the gym. If you can get it for less than $20, including shipping, and have a bunch of flash cards sitting around, it is worth it.The player works, but there are a couple annoyances with the file system support: 1. Make sure you do not put the mp3s in directories on the flash card, since the player can not find them. 2. Some of my music could not be read by the player, but it worked after I used a tagging program (MediaMonkey) to remove all the ID tags of the files after copying them over to flash. 3. The built in USB reader is finicky. I just use the drive on my laptop to copy over files."
4,"great sound, but not much else","The sound is great... better than MP3 players I have costing $100, and better than my Toshiba pocket pc, which is very good. The problem is there's no indication of what track you're playing since you move only through clicking up and down. It does play continuously and there is a pause feature, which lasts less than a minute before turning off, but it goes back to the beginning of the last track you were playing when you restart it. Other than that, when you turn it off it goes back to the same 1st track all the time. So if you have more than a dozen tracks good luck finding what you want. Also, I couldn't get it to play WMA files.For this price it might be OK if you just put on 12 or so tracks you're focussing on. Battery life is only a couple of hours, and be sure you have a good battery. But again, the sound is great."
1,Burned after having to send two back because they wouldn't work,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday. After having it a short while (I had to send off for a SD card for it to work)and downloading her songs, she really liked it. Then all of a sudden it would go off for no reason (she had it locked). So I sent it back for a replacement well that one worked for a few days. Then the light would come on but it wouldn't play anything. So after having to send two players back, I almost have enough in shipping to have paid for one player. I don't recommend this player."
5,Beware of Pressing Errors,"I have purchased this disc twice from sellers here and both times the item contained a pressing error- the contents of the disc were for another Vanguard disc with Mackerras' Petrouchka and Colin McCabe's piano transcription performance of the Firebird Suite. That disc can be found if you search for ""Petrouchka / Firebird (Hybr) [SUPER AUDIO CD - DSD]"". Great music, but I am still looking froward to hearing Mackerras's Pictures."
1,Warning,"I purchased the 32"" version of this set 14 months ago and the sound just went out entirely. Of course, the warrantee is for only 12 months, so I am out of luck."
2,"Avoid Sharp, Consider Samsung Instead","I got the LC37D43U on 5/30/08, by Nov it had a red line thru it from top to bottom. I called Sharp for warranty service, they came out and said the screen needed to be replaced. It would be 10 days. I called them 25 days later and found out they had not even ordered the part yet. In the end it took 7 weeks, they replaced the TV today.Pros:The PQ is fine. Colors good, chrisp imagesGood remote compared to others, easy to use menus.Good sound for TV speakersCons :Quality, it should not fail in a couple of monthsLOUSY customer service, NO follow up, no calls...zeroThe tuner is slow to change channelsThe side HDMI connections are not easy to connect to unless you have a small handSharp is famous for having banding issues on larger setsReccommend ; The Samsung 37"" instead. It is a better TV ( I've seen it ) but was not available when I got the Sharp. Not many choices in 37"""
4,Great TV,"I held off for a long time on buying this unit, initially looking at 32"" until I saw some in store and noted they weren't much bigger than my 1980's 27"" I intended to upgrade. Decided to treat myself and the wife for Christmas and have been very pleased. We mostly record programs with MythTV and watch them via an XBox in the living room (running Linux). My daughter bought me an Aeon Flux box set and it looks great on the set. Haven't yet tried a video game. Only complaint is I can't get quite enough volume via the XBox through the set. Looked at some surround systems to enhance the set but was little put off by the prices. In all a great set. I saw my local Walmart had the Sanyo 37"" for just a little less than the Amazon price for the Sharp, and looking at them side by side at a store, there's no comparison, the Sharp picture has much more clarity and contrast."
2,TV received broken,"Second TV finally delivered after first one received broken & returned. Eagle Shipping very unreliable and ""white glove"" service poor. Would not repurchase."
1,Picture is grainy from DVD's + Sharp Warranty consists of threats,"The good points of this TV are: 1. being able to buy it through Amazon, 2. good owners manual.Unfortunately the bad points are:1. The picture from DVD is very grainy. It is an extremely poor picture. Please read the latest issue of Consumer Reports: you will find the Auqos ranked near the bottom in every screen size (I wish I had that issue several months ago).2. The power button has to be hit several times to turn the unit on.3. The volume from one of the HDMI connections is very low.4. When contacting Sharp Warranty for points 2&3, they ""threatened"" numerous times that I would be charged if the tech could not find an issue. The threat of being charged came up so many times & also very rudely, that it came across this threat was a tactic to avoid warranty work.I suggest your read the latest issue of C.R. before considering this TV."
2,Gritty?,"Gritty? When I saw that review I had to write my own. ""Night Junkies"" is not a gritty film. Nor is it that far outside the genere, as the vampire-as-junkie film has only recently been done elsewhere; e.g. ""I Pass For Human"", & ""The Thirst"". This has better production values than those two films I'll grant it that.But there's something that peeves me about a film that deceives from the very front cover - featuring a girl with puncture marks in her neck. There's no fangs in this film. Instead the vampires tear into the throats of their victims.This serves only to trick people into buying a film they might otherwise avoid."
3,Great premise ; Okay follow through,"Vampire movies come and go. Vampire comes in, drinks blood, someone hunts him (or her), and so on and so on. This has a different take. Blood addiction. Other reviewers talked about that one, so I plan on focusing on something different.The make up artists were really spot on. And the same thing with the sound effects. That blood looked realistic and when flesh was being sunk into, I cringed.The acting wasn't anything spectacular, though. The director and actors were not inspired to bring out their best. At times, I could swear the actors just learned their lines just before rushing onto the camera. But that's rare.Buy this movie, but don't expect great things. This movie is okay."
3,america's critic,this was pretty weird and cool at the same time acting was ok story was ok vampire effects were ok this movie was ummm ok lol
2,Another bad vampire movie!,"I was lured into buying this one since the description of the story sounded pretty good. Once I put this one into the player though, it was all over. Instead of a good Vampire Thriller, all I got was a movie that couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be a vampire film or some kind of a strange violent - romantic road movie type of a film. Hence, my advice don't waste your money or time on this one. There are plenty of better movies around."
2,Not impressed,"Night Junkies did manage to keep my attention, however I felt like I was watching a movie more like Requeim for a Dream than a vampire movie. It's not what I was expecting."
3,FTM 16,FTM 16 is working now. Had some trouble making it work with Vista. Down loaded the upgrade but had trouble finding it (it's under the FAQ tab) ? Installing the restore from backup was not easy and I have some artifacts remaining that will not go away.
2,It did not solve my problem.,I bought this product because FTM 16 that I have been using for a couple of years crashed on me and the original disk would not reinstall. I purchased another copy in hopes that a new disk would get me back in business. It has the same problem as my original disk and will not install on my XP Professional Computer. I don't think it fair to blame my problem on the particular copy of FTM or Amazon. I am not sure whether to blame Ancestry.com or Microsoft for my difficulties.
1,Family Tree maker software defective,"Family Tree Maker Version 16 Standard [OLD VERSION]This product was defective from the start. It contained a complete family history from an unknown family. My preexisting Family Tree maker data would not download correctly. The seller, NothingButSoftware, would return my money but the process was complex, would take six to eight weeks for the refund and I would have to pay the shipping. For $27 it wasn't worth the effort. Next time I'll buy directly from Family Tree Maker."
2,Family Tree Maker,I was not completely satified with this software. It was not made clear that I would have to buy more software to complete my genology search.
4,Family Tree Maker sheds the DOS look.,"After many years of the same look and marginal upgrades, Family Tree Maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product. There are still some awkward navigation issues, but overall, I think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and haven't upgraded in a while or are just starting out.Having used the available online services that this company offers, I was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality. Although the integration is a bit superficial, it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive. I think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible.Too bad they do not make a Mac version, as I prefer this to the Mac products available and so I have to use it with Parallels, which is not so convenient."
4,Great product,This is my first Family Tree maker. I'm glad I read the reviews before hand. This is the version to get.
5,Family Tree Maker Version 16 Essentials,"This product is a great way to build your family tree, it includes online support as well as customer service people."
3,New researchers only,If you are new to the family tree researching this is a good start. It only helped us as long as the subscription was active. It came with a trail one & then you have to pay monthly to really be able to continue using the software. We searched as much as we could during the trail & just verified information we already had.
4,Genealogy Helps,"I like FTM Version 16 Essentials. I like it better than Version 2008 I purchased last year so I switched back to Version 11. However, I do not like it better than Version 11 I previously had loaded. The one thing I do like better is that you can enter birth and death information for all children on the family group page and you do not have to go back and forth. The one thing I did not like is that on Version 11 I had a lot of notes for a lot of people and when I updated my notes did not transfer to Version 16 along with the people."
1,Cr4ppy on the Kindle,"Dear Amazon, what is the deal with graphic novels on the Kindle Fire?You know what size the screen is, so you should know what the _MINIMUM_ text size should be. There are many panels in this book you need a magnifying glass to read, even after the panel is magnified by the Kindle App.Also, it looks like there are several pages in which the kindle thinks the panels are in the wrong place, so it is magnifying random places on the page.I dread to see what this would look like on anything smaller, like a phone!"
5,Good installment to the Sandman series,"After reading Volume 1, I was eager for more. This book did not disappoint as it explores more of Sandman's story and some characters from the Dreaming amidst a really interesting story with a surprise appearance from a character in the previous volume, none other than Unity Kinkaid. I was surprised to see her, but at the same time happy, and the story itself is actually well-written, and we also get to see Desire of the Endless and his/her relationship with Dream. If you enjoyed Volume One, you WILL enjoy this one!"
4,Their Eyes Were Watching God,The Movie Their Eyes Were Watching God was really God. The movieBeloved is horrible.
4,What a relief their back in their grove,"I was worried with Music For All Ocasion, but these boys are back on track with this wonderfully diverse album. I think the quallity of their albums reallly depends on whether or not Raul Malo is having a good time or not, and with this album he deffinently is. They get more energy with this album, then anyother, however, the writting is weaker then on the first two albums. In that respect I think they try to conform too much. Definently can't wait to see them perform again!"
5,in a league of their own!,"I have loved the Mavericks since their ""What a crying shame"" release. and the the real shame is that these guys don`t get the recognition that they deserve!"
4,Very Good,since I collect Raul Malo and the mavericks cd's & dvd's I had to have this one. It is one of their first.
5,Awesome blend of music and lyrics makes this a must-have !!!,"The combo of instruments, lyrics, and music makes this CD an excellent choice for any Country fan, or music lover! The mood will lift you and get you singing and dancing along."
4,Country band records a terrific tour de force.,"The Mavericks are known as a country band with a singer who has a Roy Orbison fixation, but ""Trampoline"" shows the band has made a huge leap in its musical breadth. Cubano, Tex-Mex, ragtime, Memphis soul, torch ballads and Byrds-like rock are played like it's as natural (and life-affirming) as breathing. And Raul Malo has served notice that he's one of the best singers and songwriters around. This album is probably far too adventurous for country or pop radio, but it's one of the best albums of 1998."
5,"A fantastic CD, a must have....super horn section!",These guys put on a great show and they definitely have scored big time with this CD. The horn arrangements on the upbeat songs are great and the sad songs are so smoooooth. One of those must have CD's for your collection...no dissappointment here.
5,rare,"""to be with you"" was the song my wife and i danced to at our wedding, and this cd is what we listened to while dating.......in fact, the wife and i both would've liked the band to play the wedding but i dont think our budget couldve handled it.....they are the gratest party band in the world.....either way, this cd is in my all time top 5 with the old 97's ""too far to care"", whiskeytown's ""stranger's almanac"", stone roses' self titled, and wilco's ""summerteeth""."
3,It was ok...,"I only enjoyed ""To be with you"" and ""Dream River"" on this CD.The rest of the songs seem rather drab.Advice to the Mavericks-Raul,go solo! They are good but they'll never ne as good as the Beatles."
3,Not That Great...,"First of all, this CD isn't country, and to call it country is a joke! It sounds more like pop or the blues, maybe even a little jazz. Second of all, most of the songs are boring and stupid. The only songs I really like are Dance The Night Away, To Be With You, and I've Got This Feeling. No wonder this CD didn't get any airplay! Country stations wouldn't know what to do with it!"
2,Is this all gays know about?,"Let me start by saying that the writing in this compilation is good. Most of them tell a story well.The big letdown is the subject matter. Most all the stories deal with AIDS, coming out, or sex. While reading, I couldn't help to think ""is this all we have to offer?"". We are such a diverse group with such a vast culture, and all we have are the standard fare of stories?I felt really let down, and almost embarassed as a gay man - these stories look like we have nothing to offer than depressing same-ol experiences..."
2,Not the greatest.,"I bought this book, hoping for a great read. But I was extremely disappointed. The book wasn't good at all. I couldn't believe all the cussing I was reading. The main character had friends that would say ""like"" all the time. There was too much high school drama that nobody wants to remember; this is one trip down memory lane I recommend not taking. I won't be reading the second book."
1,Sloppy Firsts,"First of all, I confess, I didn't finish this book. As I was reading, it seemed that the author used profanity and crude language because she thought it sounded cool and hip and trendy, rather than because it was necessary to portray the characters correctly, or to set the tone, or advance the plot. I bought this book for my 14 year old daughter, but didn't pass it along after what I read. Not only was it crude for no apparent reason, it also wasn't very good."
3,Sloppy Firsts in perspective,"Jessica Darling is your average girl: Valedictorian, athlete, insomniac, sex crazed (right), boy crazy,exaggerater and has no real friends except Hope Weaver who has just moved away. Jessica is devastated without Hope and has no where to turn while her other air-headed friends the ""Clueless Crew"" are too ""bubble-gum bimbos"" for her. Slowly throughout the course of her highschool life we see her affections begin to turn to a unlikely druggy, Marcus Flutie.This book is excellent for entertainment, has subtle romance, and life lessons for every teenager. The only thing I see holding it back is the bad mood of Ms. Darling herself. Her attitude is really annoying and she seems to whine about her life quite a lot. Girls complain, but come on, there's a limit to just blaming your foul mood on being feminine. I give it a 5 out of 10. ---A. Santiago"
5,sarcasm + wit + heart = PERFECTION,"There was zero that I didn't love about this book. I adored Jessica and all of her sarcasm. I loved her strained relationship with Scotty, her quirky friends, and Marcus, omg, I LOVED Marcus. This is top 5 of my fav books I've ever read."
5,Aaahhh! Jessica Darling!,This isn't your typical YA/Chick-Lit book and that's probably why I like it. It's really funny and sarcastic. I read it in only a few sittings.
4,Good but depressing,"I read this book in one setting. It really hit home and remined me of my depression through high school and college. I bawled through a lot of it. I hated how the ending left me hanging, but that's how you sell the next book I guess. I'm only 22 but the kids in the book made me feel old. I'm thinking it was aimed at girls a bit younger than me, but that didn't stop me from finishing it in a couple hours."
5,Sloppy Firsts - a Great First Novel!!!,"It was a pleasure to be among the first to read, chuckle, laugh out loud, and sigh with sadness at this book. I laughed, remembering my eons-ago high school experiences. I groaned, as a parent, at the words of this teen girl. This is a different view of teenage years. Usually, you read about the unhappy overweight girl, or the child from the poor home who doesn't fit in. This is a different look, indeed. This girl did fit in, but felt like she didn't...and maybe that is what teen years are all about, after all. No one feels like they fit...everyone feels different. It is funny to hear it from the side of a girl who wasn't overweight,wasn't from an economically challenged family,and had no drug or alcohol problems. Interesting, indeed. The book is an easy read, and I found it hard to put down. From one old Jersey girl to a young Jersey girl, way to go, Megan. I am looking forward to more books!"
3,"Promising, but...","This was a great novel in that there was a very nice mixture of plot and characters fleshed out a little better than paper thin. I really liked Jess, the protagonist. She came off as a real girl, and I enjoyed being inside her head with all her OCD thought and teen-angst worries, gripes and hypocrisies.On the down side, this book is littered with references to sex and not a few expletives. When I was a teen, you had to read Jackie Collins to get this kind of stuff."
3,hmmmmmmm,"The neon-colored cover and the distorted photo of this book enticed me when I first saw it. I read the summary and reviews and decided to buy it because it sounded like an interesting story. I was a bit disappointed when this girl who could have everything going for her chooses to spend a year moping about how her best friend moved away and how all of her ""friends"" are clueless. This was billed as ""humorous"" but I rarely laughed. If this was supposed to be a book about teen ansgt, the only one having angst was the reader. The only parts I got pleasure out of reading were the times when Marcus was in the picture. The only reason I am going to read the sequel is to see where that relationship goes. That was the most honest, true-to-teenage-life thing about that book."
4,"Finally, someone gets us!","I read this book within a time span of three days. It was such an amazing read, capturing the thoughts of a brilliant young woman caught in the middle of growing up. The main character, Jessica Darling, goes through several ups and downs, and learns how to cope with her best friend moving and finding herself. I recommend this book for anyone who has ever felt lost/alone in a world full of mainstream everything...it'll make you feel as though you aren't so different after all."
5,A Must-read,"Sloppy Firsts is one of the best books I have ever read. The book is in a diary format and when I read it, I felt like it could have been from my own diary. I recommend this book to people of all ages."
1,Not appropriate!!!,"Wow! I thought this book was going to be good, but when I started to read it, I found it very unsuitable for people of any age! There is so much profanity in it that is not the least bit enjoyable! I haven't even finished it! It is defintely not worth reading! It encourages premarrital*sp sex, along with drinking, drugs, and other various things. So if you are looking for a pleasant and enjoyable read, this ISN'T the book!!!! I'm very disappointed in this author's work!"
1,loving it,i love your work. pure genius. my grandaughter is on my kindle all day searching your work. hope you make a sixth and seventh book. allof the rest of the books are funny and entertaining!
1,Morally Perverse,"This book was disgusting. No one should EVER let a highschool girl read it. It encourages premarital sex and drugs and underage alcohol consumption.The writing quality is very poor, as well."
5,GREAT FUN!,"SLOPPY FIRSTS is a great novel which I truly enjoyed reading. The narrator is Jessica Darling, a high schooler, who goes through many experiences and learns a lot along the way. What is Jessica to do when her best friend has just moved away, her dad obsesses over her high school track career, and her mom is too involved with her older sister's wedding to help her other daughter? Jessica must learn how to deal with all these things while tackling other problems which come her way, including her shallow friends, her relationship with one of her guy friends, and bad boy Marcus. This book is just great FUN -- you should definitely read it! Also recommended: THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez"
5,A great mix of Adult Style with Realistic Teendom :),"Megan McCafferty's novel about 16 year old Jessica Darling is one just about every girl can relate to in some way. From the dreams of finding that rare true guy friend (been there!), to the agony of not living up to your parents expectations (yep), unrequited love and unwanted love (yessum), to losing and finding your friends (for sure), this book covers a lot of topics that are just downright normal...but are made incredibly interesting through a variety of humorous situations and intelligent narration by Jessica via her personal journal. McCafferty's book doesn't after-school special teenage-hood, or make it uber boring, or super unbelievable, instead it makes you find the qualities most angsty teenagers have in themselves that relate to Jessica Darling, and draws you in as you look at your own experiences and compare them to Jessica's. (I'm 17 so I can definately relate!). A great effort, I can't wait to read the second book!"
5,Sloppy Firsts =D,"This was a really good book. I enjoyed reading it because I was able to make a lot of connections to it. This book wasn't dull or boring at all it was really interesting and it was a good story to follow. It's easy to relate to this book if you are a teen because this book has really teen drama in it and I never had to force myself to read it, it always was just a really easy book to read and understand. =]"
3,Sloppy Firsts,"The best way to describe Sloppy Firsts is that it's the female version of Catcher in the Rye. Also, it's more modernized. The best part about the book is the main character Jessica Darling. She's creative, outspoken, witty, and quite funny. Sloppy First is about Jessica's junior year in high school and all the problems that she encounters that ranges from boy trouble to family issues. There's one scene where Jessica is sick of how her dad just wants her to be a track star so she purposely goes and tries to trip in order to injure herself. Of course everything doesn't work out the way she wants. I recommend Sloppy Firsts if you want to dive deep into the teenage girl's mind. Overall, this book is a good read."
4,"Light, fun read","I really enjoyed this book. At 298 pages I thought it was going to be easy to read, but it actually took me a while. This book had a nice plot line and it will make you laugh a lot. Although there are parts that are confusing it is generally well written. It is a good book for a rainy weekend when you're just plain bored."
5,Best Book Ever!,This book is so great. It is written in the form of the journal by Jessica Darling and is a hysterical account of her sophmore year of high school. I loved this book because it was laugh-out loud funny and definately a page turner!
5,very good,"This book is very good, i was suprised to enjoy it so much because it was for school. The ending is kinda a letdown but all in all it was great. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh."
4,A Really Great Book,"This book was very funny yet was very realistic of an every day life of a teenager! I really recommend this book to any teenage girl, it really makes you think about your own life and how some things really don't matter.Again it was a very good book and i hope that every one liked it as much as me!"
4,Bubble Gum Bimbos,"What ""Miss Hyacinth"" called the book that she wrote, was quite an appropriate name for this book. Although the book was written well, it was all focused upon sex. Me, being a highschool student, am proud to say that that is not all i focus on every day of my life. Plus, me myself being a ""band geek"" have discovered that at least at my highschool, that isn't such a bad thing... i think this book is good writing wise, but it fails to come across with good values. Basically the only message is ""Sex is good sex is great, come on guys now MATE MATE MATE!"" (not said in the book). The basic message is that you can't be cool unless you have sex. which isn't true."
1,NOT FOR YOUNG TEENS!,"My 14 y/o daughter borrowed this from the library, and the title made me want to peek through it before she did. I'm not overly protective, but I also feel I should not be promoting inappropriate lit or entertainment for her either. So, without reading much of it, I could easily see TONS OF PROFANITY, primarily the F-word, all throughout the pages. It also has 15-17 y/o girls and boys discussing sex - both for themselves and others. For example, ""eff-ing the ess out of someone"". Whether or not kids talk like this at school doesn't give a good reason to have my daughter read about it. What message are we sending teens if we hand them books that are trash talk?? Sorry, not for my girl. There's plenty of other good books out there that don't have to sensationalize sex and foul mouths."
2,Not a great read!!! (unless you're 13 or younger),This book is a confusing mess of poor grammar and teen angst. It is the story of a (VERY) cynical girl's home and school life. Her troubles are meaningless and this book clearly lacks substance.
5,awesome!,"I just finished reading this book today, and I was totally blown away! McCafferty totally tells it like it really is. It was laugh-out-loud funny and very realistic. The feelings portrayed by Jessica were very similar to a genius student just trying to get by in high school (just like me!). All in all, the book was definitly worth the money, and I recommend it to teenagers and above---even older people will enjoy this read."
3,Hmm..,This book is alright. It has a close connection to teenaged girls and what goes on with them. This reminds me a lot of the book 'That Summer' by Sarah Dessen.
2,Don't Bother,"I was so excited to read this book! It seems as if it would be a terrific ""beach read"" of a book, something funny and light-hearted. I thought it would make me laugh at the funny and emphatic events that teens go through during high school, but I was surprised to read a story of stupid plots and annoying characters. Although depicted very well, the main character, Jessica Darling, complained throughout the whole book. I was very dissapointed; instead of an enjoyable story about a teenage girl, it was a stupid plot about a teen who did nothing but complain."
4,NOT for young teens,"This book was entertaining but it is not for a 13-year-old. It is set in a sexually sophisticated world, where most girls have sex with whatever boy they happen to be dating, and it's not that unusual for one of your pals to be known for her proclivitytoward oral sex, lots of it... There is an entertaining story going on behind all of the sex, though, and I'm sure older teens and some adults will enjoy the book. I found it to be entertaining. I just wasn't expecting it to be quite this sexy. Not that the sex is explicit. It is just there, everywhere.""Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging"" has a little less sex in it but enough to fascinate a 13 or 14 year old, I'd say, and it's hysterical. If you are buying a recent book for a younger teen, try that one. (If you're buying a book for an 11 or 12 year old, try ""Zazoo"" - it's got a great story with just a bit of romance.)"
5,Sloppy Firsts,"If I could I would rate this a 10 star! I loved this book! It is so entertaining and funny, and at the end when I read the sneak peak for Second Helpings I laughed so hard I felt like I was going to burst. I finished this book in one night, and I can't wait to get a copy of Second Helpings and Charmed Thirds. I would recommend this to a teenager who wants to read about real issues or even an adult who can remember when their life was as crazy and hectic as Jessica Darling's life. Also if you're looking for an awesome gift, this is PERFECT for any teenager!"
1,Not your sweet Traveling Pants book --Not for young teens!,"I bought this book because it was recommended if you enjoyed the Traveling Pants books. My 14 year old daughter and I loved both of the Traveling Pants books, but there is no way I would let her read Sloppy Firsts. I have never sent a new book back in my life, but after reading the first few pages of Sloppy Firsts, I decided Amazon could have this one returned. The language is foul and the sexual references are beyond the ""young adult"" genre scope. This is not a book a young teen should read. Save your money!"
2,Not my thing,"I'm 32 and this seems a little young, I couldn't get into it. I guess I should have paid more attention to the target audience age."
4,Sloppy Firsts,"Sloppy Firsts is one of those girlie books, yet it has a twist. Jessica Darling brings you into the novel by her journal. There you uncover her feelings about her best friend moving away, the boy that still wants to be with her even after their break-up, the girls that she is left to hang out with, and many other high school dramas. Jessica finds ways of dealing with these problems, which make the book a must read. Her ways of getting out of a sticky situation just land her in a new one. It's a fun and enjoyable book that will make you laugh and even relate to. Enjoy!"
5,Hilarious,"Sloppy Firsts has to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. When i first read the title i thought it was going to be one of those trashy books. After i read it, i read it over and over again. It really captures the feelings and emotions of teenagers who see the world in a bigger way than other teenagers. If you read this book make sure you also read Second Helpings the sequel. Reading about Jessica Darling's sophomore and junior year was not only hilarious but touching."
5,Now my favorite Book!,"I was looking through Amazon.com teenage book lists, and i saw Sloppy Firsts as one of them, so i bought it, and i loved it!! Being 16, i can relate to the feelings that Jessica is feeling, and i thought that the author did a wonderful job of developing her character as well as the plot. As soon as i started reading it, i couldn't put it down! I've let my friends read it, and so far, all of them had really enjoyed it. This is an excellent buy for teenagers, and i would definatly recommend it. I'm just waiting for the second one!"
5,A Blast!,"I totally related to this book and the experiences of Jessica, feeling mostly like a fish out of water myself! This is a hilarious, very easy-to-read book that I recommend to everyone. It deals with peer pressure, loneliness, shopping -- all the crazy experiences and thoughts that go through your mind in high school -- and in life! It's also very entertaining. I also recommend two other books: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes and The Losers' Club by Richard Perez."
4,"Light, funny, and somewhat cliche","Though we've seen countless novels like this one before, and countless characters resembling Jessica Darling, this book will make for a fun read. If you're in the mood for some teen-angst, high-school drama, this book hits the spot. There's nothing really unique about this novel, but Megan McCafferty still finds a way to make it so good, that you'll be eager for more."
4,Fun for all ages,"Such a great book. McCafferty's sense of humor is great. Even though her main character is a high school student, almost anyone can relate to her experiences (or at least remember what they were like).I'm almost thirty and loved it. The friend that recommended it is in her mid-thirties and I passed the book along to my fifteen year old neighbor. It's a great light read, that most will appreciate.The next two books are great as well."
2,Sloppy Firsts,"I started out really liking this book. I could relate to alot that was going on in Jessica's life and the humor in it was great. But she really struck a nerve with me when we basically had to listen to how wonderful Jessica is, and how everyone else in the world, except Hope, is beneath her. She complained about how all her classmates were nowhere near as smart as she was. Or how she was always going to win her track meets. Why? Because Jessica Darling is like, perfect. That's what I hated most about this book. That in her OBSESSION with her best friend Hope. So make some new friends. But who that's right. Jessica is way too shallow for that.I'm not sure yet if I'll read the next one in line or not. I may give her one more chance yet."
5,One of my favorite books,"I LOVED this book, Jessica is the kind of girl that all teenage readers can relate to. she is smart, funny and she is real. Megan McCafferty did a great job with Jessica and the rest of the characters development. I loved Marcus Flutie and The Clueless Crew were hilarious. I recommend this book to everyone.~I also recommend Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging series, The Gossip Girl series and of course, Second Helpings~"
2,Ugh.,"This is the watered-down, glib side of electronic keyboard music. Granted, a few songs are listenable if you can just forget you're listening to Thomas Dolby, but when he apparently tries to be deep (i.e. the ascension of man would-be epic) one feels instinct tugging at the vomit reflex. Some points reach the nadir of electronica. The attempts to mix up this dated hooey with singing go terribly awry, dispelling any notion of stand-alone music (as good keyboard music can be). If you expect NOTHING from this album, you will be rather pleased. For the love of real electronica, however, turn elsewhere. Please."
3,CyberSpace-Stories mainly in LawnmowerMan-like scenes,"A must-see for any lover of Computer Generated Art and stories. The plot is nearly non-existent, in my opinion, though many have said they don't understand how I can say such a thing; the graphics are enough to make up for it. Extremely cool. I would suggest this to people who are fans of animation."
4,I cant find the dvd... but the music is all I need!,"I got the cd for free because my dad drinks pepsi.he ""bought"" it off I tunes and burned it onto a cd for me, thus a b-day present.I really enjoy this cd now. I was surprised that he dosent sing very much in it ( nuvouge is a singer)and i find the beats easy to find and very helpful if you are strugling through Strings class.I really enjoy it now, and like most of his music, I can go to sleep to it.( look at my about me section!)"
2,The Gate to Out-Dated Animation,"Can you say ""out of date"" Kids? The problem with choosing computer animation based on how it might ""wow"" people with it's state of the art effects, is that in just a COUPLE YEARS it becomes ""history"". I'm a digital artist and was deeply disapointed that this collection focused on what WAS, at that time,: 'state of the art'. I've seen a lot of computer artists using both new and old software to create 'timeless' art. Too bad this collection was looking at the 'new' EFFECTS, rather than looking for true artwork. Because of this, we get work that was out of date just a couple years after it was created. If you're into the history of the evolution of computer animation, this is a fine example. If you were looking for something that would be considered fine art decades after it's creation, look elsewhere."
2,Not the same as the original...,"Having been born in 1994, I literally grew up with this film. It was my favorite movie and will always hold a special place in my heart. To date, I still lug out my monstrous VHS player in order to play my original 1994 copy, handed down to me from my father. So, I jumped at the chance of buying a DVD copy of this fantastic film. However, upon viewing, I found it was definitely not the same. In the DVD version I received, the sound effects had been drastically changed. Arguably the best part of this film is the music. Thomas Dolby is a freaking genius. But in the DVD copy I got, the sound effects often drowned out the music. This new version had added tons of spacey sound effects that had either been far quieter or not present whatsoever. This really frustrated me. I really want a copy that is just like the original release, but it costs like, 30 bucks to transfer a VHS to DVD. Oh well, at least the DVD was cheap..."
5,got it for a class,works just what they say it will.. good construction and materials works just what they say it will.. good construction and materials
4,Early CG Effects Still Fun To Watch,"This is an ""odysessy through time"" via computer animation, supposedly th ework of over 300 artists. Made in the late '80s and released in 1990, this was cutting edge stuff for the day. Almost 20 years later, I still thought it was good and quite interesting in spots.Most of the short scenes made no sense, just forms evolving into other forms, but that was fun to watch. This is all about visuals, not really about any kind of a story. There were some strange sequences in which odd-looking men/creatures would dance around with birds overheard. All of it is computer animated which was brand new back then.It's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. There are no words, just pictures with electronic music. Oh yeah, the music is pretty cool, too!"
3,AC adapter,"I can't really rate this item. I never recieved it. The tracking number said it was delivered but it didn't come to me. I recommend people to get insurance on their purchases or you will loose your money. It wasn't the company's fault, I think it was the mail man's fault or it was stolen."
4,"A Tom Clancy work of art,but a little more polish was needed","I personally liked this book,but the story was a little bit unbelivable and hard to follow.Its got everything a corporate espionage thriller fan could ask for,but it could have been toned down (Because of the sex and sometimes grisly violence).You'll like it,but Dont bet on it being the first Clancy novel you pick up."
1,Worthless piece of trash writing,"I'd give it zero stars if that were an option. Shallow characters, thin plot, gratuitous gore meant only to cater briefly to that genre. Clancy is riding on his reputation in this one, and I, for one, am sorely disappointed. Hate to admit I paid full supermarket price for a new copy. He used to be my all time favorite author, but I'll preview the next novel before I spend money on it."
2,Don't buy this book!!!,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected something packed with suspense and intrigue since it was a Clancy. Instead, I got a boring story that never went anywhere. Clancy never ties together all the plot twists and he copped out big time with his sorry ending. All I can say is, ""Tom Clancy, you stink!"" (and so does Ruthless.com)PS - This will be the last Tom Clancy book I ever read."
1,Basically Boring,Third class Clancy work not worthwhile unless nothing else available. I rate this material not worthy of consideration
1,WORST CLANCY TALE,"I'M A BIG FAN OF MOST OF CLANCY'S WORK, THATS WHY RUTHLESS WAS SUCH A LETDOWN. TOM PLEASE NO MORE POWER PLAYS"
2,Save your money...,Ed McBain once said he wrote one of his books 'because I needed the money'. And the book was good. Tom Clancy must need the money but he did not bother writing or even reading this quickly hashed pseudo-technological thriller full of inaccuracies and typos published under his name.
1,Horribly Dissapointing,"I have read every book Written or inspired by Tom Clancy up to the Power Play's series. I have been horribly dissapointed by this series and specifically with Ruthless.com The plot is underdeveloped and the characters are terribly introduced and explained. It seems as if the authors tried to cram all of the intrigue of a Clancy book into 400 pages, which if you are a true clancy fan you know his usually run into 600-700 pages. If this book were given the attention it needs on the characters and plot then it would be an excelent read. Unfortunately as it stands this book is absolutely pitiful. I had to force myself to finish it by telling myself it would get better in the next chapter. Don't read this....."
2,Cashing In On Clancy's Name!,I bought this book because I thought it was written by Tom Clancy. The people that sold me this book are still laughing at me for buying it. I will be glad when Tom Clancy starts writing his onw books again. Roger Gordian falls termendously short in his role as a hero.The plot for this book is very weak. The evil plot of a corporate takeover nearly takes off but falls short also. This book series has so far been very bad. I wish they(Tom and his ghostwriter) would start writing quality books.I have nearly gotten to the point where I donot buy these books with cowriters. Maybe I will find a book that is really written by Tom Clancy
2,Worthless.com,Bad book. Clearly not written by Tom Clancy. I will have to watch Clancy write his next book before I buy it.
2,Yeah right.,"A gunfight in the Hyatt?! I live here. Even toy pistols resembling the real thing are banned.Either Tom or Martin should spend some time here before even trying to emulate ""Singlish"", some of the dialogue made me wince.Finished the book in less than 24 hours. Not too engaging. Thanks to Steve who lent me the book, 3 years here and your ""lahs"" are still wrong. :-)"
5,Great Book,a great book even thought a terribloe endinggets your blood flowing everywhere. Great book for young adults. Great book for kids like me. Great bookj for you. Great book for your dad. Great book for your mom. Great book for your aunt. Great book for your uncle. Great book for your dog.
4,Ruthless.com is an action packed thriller!!!!,I like all the action in the book and how Tom Clancy goes into great detail. I also like the plot of the story. The idea of one men trying to keep a group of terrorists from acquiring the controll of super weaponsThe one thing I didn't like was all the talk about buisness and stocks. Alot of it went way over my head.I would reccomend this book to most guys because I dont think girls would put up with any killing or military stuff.
2,never fully develops the story line,"The back cover talks about the encryption issue, yet this subject is never fully developed in the book - it is alluded to here and there, but how it all fits into the major scheme of things only becomes somewhat apparent towards the end of the book. Additionally, I found the whole story line to be lacking. Not the usual Clancy suspense and elaborate story line."
2,Underdeveloped storyline and characters,"Sorry, but this is one of the worst ""Clancy"" books I've read. The characters are some of the most paper-thin personalities Clancy has created to date. Also, the plot took forever to unfold, then rapidly wrapped up in the last 15-20 pages or so. This left me feeling cheated, especially because the first chapters of the book were well done. Overall, I would have to say that if Clancy writes or ""creates"" any more books like Ruthless.com, I will stop reading his work. One caution, although this book is a techno-thriller, I found the descriptions of wounding/killing much more graphic than what I'm use to with Clancy's work."
3,A slightly above average Clancy of the month author.,"This book had Tom Clancy's name on it. However, it did not have the look or feel of a Clancy novel.The story was marginally developed. The conclusion was not worth reading the book for."
1,Never again will I read a Tom Clancy book.,Ok..to make this short and sweet...this book is so bad that It coulden't hold my attention for the first 50 pages..yeah I gave it some time..it was so confusing and made no sense. I had to do a book report and had to make up or emphasis certain parts that I did read to make it seem like I did. I would have not given a star if there was that choice.
1,Lame dot-com thriller,"This book centers on a US company's refusal to market its encryption software to the worldwide market. It is written as if the government was OK with that, but these high minded software companies don't want this powerful encryption technology to fall into the hands of EVIL (apparently any non US citizen would be that, but of course there are no bad guys here!). Anyway, this is pretty funny because in reality the government was the one without a clue and was blocking encryption software from being sold outside the US, even though much of it was freely available from many places outside the US already.Another funny bit is the ""stock crash"" news clipping: the stock fell over $15 down to $45 over a week. Heh, for a tech company that is doing pretty good -- it is still at $45 a share after all :-)"
1,A few words...,"Red is a 'color' or 'colour' only because the spelling for both words has been established and accepted as correct a long time ago. Even so, strictly speaking 'color' is used in the US English context whereas 'colour' is used in the UK English context. In either case, the mistakes that I have pointed out are not a result of alternate spelling but more to case wrong spelling, as to the best of my knowledge they have never been spelled in the way the author has. Even if there is such an alternate spelling, the spelling used should be reflective of how it is spelled in the local context. To illustrate my point further, if a person is called 'Kelvin', would it have been acceptable for another to call him 'Melvin'? After all, is it not an alternative spelling?My review of the actual story itself may perhaps be hidden within the rest of the review. It may not be much, but it is there. I did not see a need to point it out explicitly."
1,This Is Tom's Worst Book,"I can't believe that I'm 3/4ths through this mire and haven't burned it. There is almost no redeeming quality to this trash and one can only wonder how an author will put his reputation on the line with junk like this! I will force myself to finish it only because I've invested $5.+ something at Walmart for the thing. Never, in all the years I was in business, did I offer so little for so much toMY customers. Tom Clancy, gobury your head in the sand. You're NOT on my best seller list!"
2,Not a best effort. Obviously trying to sell the game.,"The book is an example of the type of characters who are involved in the worldwide game. The plot was jumpy, characters sketchy."
3,"A great book,but it should have been so much more.","Ruthless.com was a wonderful book,but a little polish and it would have been a classic worthy to stand up there with other Clancy novels.The plot was a little shallow,the characters were a little too thin, and the book was too grisly.It needed to be toned down.I liked it, but it doesent deserve to stand up to ither,better, Clancy books.Bet on another title with his name,or Michael Chriton.He's good."
2,"Not quite a ""Clancy""","I'm at the last few pages of the book and realize that there are simply not enough pages left to tie everything together and come up with a resolution of all that's been presented. I definitely can't believe Lear would build a jet with no manual override for landing gear. Of course, my career has been in Navy Ship Repair, not aircraft, so I can't speak from authority but I expect Clancy to be able to. Among many 'typo's' (giving benefit of the doubt here) one glaring error jumped out at me. Am I actually the last living human that knows the difference between, ""affect"" and ""effect?"""
2,A GRAND DISAPPOINTMENT,"The plot was not exciting and there were lots of factual errors. As a native of Singapore, Clancy did not bother to check his facts or spelling. Name of the places were mispelt often (""Raiu"" for the Riau islands...etc). Don't buy it!"
2,A grand disapointment.........,"This book made me really lose faith in Mr. Clancy. I have read all of his fiction books because of his great ability to write engaging plots and conflicts with thecnology woven in, but Ruthless.com made me think that Mr. Greenberg wrote it and Clancy just slapped his name on it....it was TERRIBLE cmpared to his other books! I really wish Mr. Clancy took some time to check over this, cause the characters have alot of potential, but are so poorly exploited..... I hope next time Mr. Clancy takes some time check over his work....."
3,GOOD FOR DRIVING IN TRAFFIC,This BOT is easy to listen to not to deep. A good one for driving in traffic where you can't fully concentrate.
1,"The worst ""Clancy"" book yet :-(","Clancy and his publisher need to find another ghost writer for this ""Power Plays"" series. It was dull dull dull reading. Also, there were enough enough technical ""bloopers"" to further supress any suspension of disbelief. For example, why would the U.S. Navy keep their encryption keys at a commercial facility, especially one that is overseas? How does a Japanese-American pass herself off as the sister of a Chinese woman?There was some amusement, I suppose, in reading about the antagonist, who is a Harvard-dropout billionaire chairman of a monopolistic computer software firm, get his in the end."
3,"Not expected fr Mr. Clancy, book is ok Ch. 19 & 20 just bad","What is disappointing to me, and I am a Clancy enthusiast, is the obvious lack of research that went into Chapters 19 & 20. The aviation related references were poorly written, highly unlikely, and outright innacurate. The flight of the Lear45, based at an airfield with a 3400' runway, from the west coast to Dulles from departure to landing was laughable and indicated to me that whatever research was conducted was less than cursory. Mr. Clancy's proofreaders did a very poor job before slapping his name on this work. I was embarrassed for him."
2,this is a disappointment,"this book, it seems is not written for the reader audience, but was written so that Tom Clancy can have another way of promoting a book. This book, also has the classic Tom Clancy problem, that happens with his later books, that don't really have an ending. This book takes about 50-60 pages to end, when leading up to the climax took 350 pages"
2,Clancy rides on laurels. A shame.,This was a disappointing book to read. The quality just didn't live up to his other books. Wasn't even close. Certainly toward the end of the Jack Ryan series the level of detail was headed down and the preludes to the action was headed up but this book was almost all setup. And then the climax fizzled and fell flat.I truly loved the Ryan series. With luck the many bad reviews this book has gotten will cause Clancy to pay more attention to the quality of the works put out under his name.And who knows. Maybe a video game isn't the best place for a book concept to come from...
1,Will the REAL Tom Clancy please write a book?,"From the FIRST PAGE I knew that Tom Clancy did not write this book. The extreme violence in the first chapter was further proof. I put it down and restarted reading it a few times hoping Clancy would show up SOMEWHERE, but he never did. I didn't make it past the 3rd chapter.I am a huge fan of Clancy and have all of the fiction HE has written plus all of the Op-Center series (which were quite good if not the usual spectactular Clancy style), but DO NOT waste your money or time on this book!!! ZERO-Stars"
3,"OK, not good","Had this book focused on the abduction of the world leaders and used the encryption technology as a secondary plot, Ruthless.com might be worth more. As it is, the book read slow in many areas, but still was slightly entertaining."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!,"This book is boring, sloppy, and pointless. DO NOT BUY IT! I would have rated it 0 stars"
1,Sub-par work from Tom Clancy.,"After reading several books from Tom Clancy I was extremely disappointed with this novel. In the age of every business trying to cash it on the "".com"" phrase Tom Clancy tried to ""piggy-back"" on this phenomenon as well. Shame on you."
1,"As a contributor, an unfortunate use of the Clancy name!","Incredibly, this book actually made it to the sales shelves! It is poorly written (grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and some lack of continuity) and leaves little to stimulate the reader. The plot is easily seen through and the technical aspects with which I am familiar (aviation) are so awfully presented that I am forced to consider how technically accurate the book's other subject areas are. All in all, a very bad reading experience."
1,Misrepresentation,"What a supreme disappointment this was! I have no interest in these songs whatsoever and thought I was purchasing a soundtrack containing the beautiful music from the movie. Now, I see that there is ANOTHER soundtrack, but am simply not sure I want to buy it now because I feel like I've been duped!"
2,Disappointing Except for Second Number,"When I ordered this CD I thought I was getting the movie soundtrack. Only the second number (""A Soft Place to Fall"") came from the movie and it was a beautiful number. I later ordered the soundtrack and, as someone who loved the movie, I was transcended back to the mood and feeling of the movie. This CD was a disappointment and I think confused a great many people who ordered it instead of the soundtrack. Not a great marketing ploy if you want people to think well of the production."
5,love it!!,"Thank you............thank you ...........thank you!!! Whoever was the 'creator' of this CD. Thank you to Robert Redford; for reminding us all of the wonderful, spiritual feelings of the ""old"" style country music and life-style. The huge mountains and farm lands that I miss so dearly. Thank you for bringing me back to my 'roots' that I am not afraid or ashamed to admit that I love. Too bad this world has gotten so far away from the simple things, the beautiful....real...things in life. Nothing fake or plastic here. Life is made to be loved again...thank you for this wonderful CD!!"
5,Wonderful,"I found this CD to be full of beautiful, well-performed songs. Though only two of the songs are actually heard in the movie, the others on the CD are based upon the themes and storyline in the movie. All in all, this CD is a great momento of the movie."
1,Reminiscent of Roy Rogers songs and style,"What I expected was the actual soundtrack, what I got was cowboy, and western songs. Yes, Dwight Yoakam's cattle call is excellent. This CD does nothing to remind the listener of the vast vista's and beautiful scenery depicted in the film. A Major Disappointment"
2,Two songs worth listening to,Only two songs on this album - A Soft Place to Fall and Me and the Eagle are worth listening to. The others are fillers. I am tired of programming my CD player to skip them. Thank you Steve Earle.
2,Watch out for the software,"I have no complaints about the hardware. My complaint is with the horrible software that comes with it. The Simple Burner is just awful. It's limited- you can't edit tracks like you can with Nero and it crashes. I lost three hours of work when the Simple Burner ""encountered an error"" and had to close! It's a damned shame because the Atrac3 format is excellent with a wonderful sound and more can be put on a disk than with MP3.If you're going to sell a product that can compete with MP3, you should have decent software and better support!"
4,"Good sound, silly mistakes.","I have really enjoyed my new gadget. It sounds good, has enough volume, unless you enjoy hearing loss. Even the squished Atrac compression suprised me. However, some of the basic playback features I found lacking. When playing compressed files, the CD stops spinning after gathering enough info and putting it into memory. This is cool, because the spinning uses the most battery life. However, there is a fairly lengthy gap between each cut. This is not a problem with most music, but if you have a continous mix CD, then you lose the feel of the DJs performance every time a new track is dropped. This is my first device of this sort, so maybe this is not unusual, but it is aggravating. Otherwise it's a great little gadget.Dr. Anthony Danza"
1,SENDS ELECTRIC SHOCKS TO YOUR HEADPHONES,"i bought this because i wanted something tiny. parts of it are designed well, but all of this is irrelevant, because if you move it at all it shorts, sends a shock through your head phones to your ears, and stops playing"
1,parts missing.,parts missing .package had been opened .no way this could even hoke up to lid. amazon refunded my money---.chef makes good equip -------- q.c. slipped.
5,Inspiration,"Georgia Tate is inspirational. Even after being abused by her father and losing her grandmother, Georgia was still hopeful and joyful. She always knew that two things would always be there for her: God and her grandpa.I would recommend this book for anyone 13 and older."
5,A magical summer read!,The scenes and characters in this book will transport any reader to afternoons spent at a grandparent's farm or Fourth of July celebrations. Georgia Tate shows us how to work through life's challenges and find the friends and family who will help us. Put this on your reading list - it will not disappoint!
5,Wonderful novel!,"I loved Claiming Georgia Tate. It's beautifully written, and the characters are vivid and compelling. Amateau does a super job balancing very serious subjects with a sense of hope and the possibility of recovery. I don't like novels that pretend bad things never happen OR that pretend only bad things ever happen--Amateau negotiates this line beautifully. And I found the ending quite hopeful; it's not all wrapped up in a neat bow, but the message is still positive. As for the bad language that a number of reviews have mentioned, I thought it was entirely appropriate in context, and it's used by some of the most disturbing characters in the book--the novel certainly doesn't make bad language seem attractive. I want my teen daughter to read this book."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"I love this series! Zoey faces problems with her boyfriend when his enemy comes back from jail. Zoey finds herself falling in love with her bf's enemy! Throughtout the books there are problems with Cristopher, Aisha, Lucas, Jake, Claire, Zoey, Nina and Benjamin! I am reading the republished series. I have read up to book number 4. The 5th book was supposed to be out Sep 3rd but I can't find it! I recomend this book for everyone! I couldn't put this book down or any others! -<3- *~jEsSy~*"
4,This book helps teens who are falling in love.,this book is very good and it gives teens an idea of how hard love life is. Especially falling in love with another guy while you have a boyfriend.
4,the book was good and i'm glad they're re-publishing it.,I thought applegate did a good job on this book and the rest in the series and i'm glad they're re-publishing the series.
5,Gossip,"If you like gossip then this is the book to read, you get a great veiw from all the charactors and the plot is just excellent. You feel yourself siding with certain people than half way throuhg you decide there evil from some gossip you've heard about them, is just a must read."
4,great book,"""Zoey Fools Around"" is about a girl named Zoey who falls for Lucas Cabral. The thing is, everybody on Catham Island (where Zoey lives) hates Lucas because he drunk and drove, which resulted in Wade McRoyan's death. Zoey's boyfriend, Jake, is Wade's younger brother, and if he finds out that Zoey's fooling around with Lucas, he won't be angry. He'll be furious . . ."
3,Disappointing.,"I thought this book was going to be much better than it actually was. Don't get me wrong, some parts were interesting, most of all Aisha and Christopher. Their little ""NON-romance"" was the best! However, some parts were just plain boring! I must have skipped half the book the first (and only) time that I read it. That said, Katherine Applegate knows what being a teen is like and it was realistic in a way. I didn't hate this book. Personally, I liked the other stuff she has written MUCH MUCH MORE. Try reading ""See You in September"" or ""Listen to My Heart""(Love Stories Super Ed. #1)"
5,The Start of Something Good.....,"I loved this book!!! I've read in maybe fifty times and never tire of it. The rest of the series is also great, and I'm up to book #18. This is the start of something great. It's a phemomenon with friends in my area. These books are never at the library- they're always taken!!!I think it's great Ms Applegate is giving us something encouraging and enjoyable to read, especially when reading is not considered a cool thing to do"
1,Talk about your average Soap Opera situation,"I didn't like this book. I mean, hello? Zoey's a bad person! I've read what happens in the up coming books, and she is such a player! First with her long time boyfriend, Jake, to Lucas, then to Aaron! When I got halfway to the book, I couldn't take it anymore and stopped. C'mon this is what usually happens in other books. The same plot. All I have to say is, I don't wanna get anymore of these books... Try reading ""SVH Senior Year."" Now, the Senior books are a good series..."
4,"Its a great start to the series,you're captivated immediatly","Its a good way to start a series, and you get to know the chrecters right away and it doesnt waste any time launching into the plot. The only problem is that you're immediatly hooked and you'll find yourself with your nose in ""Making Out"" books any chance you have."
5,JUST THE FIRST TO A GREAT SERIES!,"Gosh! If you havent read this series of books you are REALLY missing out, Katherine Applegate is a great writer,but i just wish she could write faster.(he he) I am 17 years old, and these are great books for teens of my age,and younger. I hope you take everyones advice to read these books, There great. OH THEY SHOULD REALLY MAKE THESE BOOKS INTO A TELEVISION SERIES, I WOULD DEFINATELY BE WATCHING :)~~~~~HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS! :)"
4,Like it a lot,"I think that Zoey Fools Around is a great book. I like the plot, and the characters are really well done. My one complaint is that at the end when Zoey and Lucas are kissing, the way it's written is kind of corny. Aside from that, I liked it a lot. Worth the money and more."
5,A great Series for all teens!!!!,One day I couldn't decide what book to get then i saw zoey fools around and know that my friend was talking about how good it was the day before i got it. I never regreted it. Now it's like a must with my group of friends. We are constentally borrowing them and buying them. We can't wait to read the next one. If you love the type of books that leave you hanging from one to another this seris is a must!!!
5,Great reading !!,"I wasn't sure how i would like the book, but after reading it i had to get the following books in the series ! I totally feel in love with the book and its story. I feel like I know the teens on the island, and I can relate to the whole story! Thanks K.A. Applegate for the books."
3,Does a good job,"My only gripe is it is noisy. I do like the program modes that provide a more ""wind-like"" experience. The remote is a nice touch."
5,A vet remembers,An accurate description of the events involved in this unfortunate engagement.As a national serviceman serving in the commonwealth division and involved in the important battles of the hook was disappointed he made no mention of them.However found the last chapter extremely incisive and thought provoking.
3,Sony CD player,This CD player for playing cds is fine but trying to tune in any tv/fm/weather stations is poor.The reception/static is bad. I live in the Boston area and should not that problem.
2,The Music Maven,"I was completely dissapointed with this CD Walkman because it cannot play CD-R disks. I have a much older Panasonic that never claimed to play CD-Rs and it does a much better job. Naturally, I called Best Buy and the Sony ""help line"" and neither was any help at all. If you are looking for a CD player that can play your CD-Rs, go to another brand.Also, I learned early on that the remote has so many functions tht it does not operate reliably. Try to turn off the CD player and you may turn on the radio, and burn out your batteries as a result. I lost several sets of batteries before I learned to check that the thing was off before putting it away.As I am reading on several other reviews of Sony products, they have become arrogant and remote and do not give a damn about consumers. This product is inferior; it does not perform as advertised. Choose a different brand if you want good performance. This one is a not worth the money"
1,Wont play cd-r's,I had problem with it getting to play my cd-r's and some of my baught cd's. I cant believe its so expensive and doesnt play. I'm back to portable tapes now for a while.
1,If I could only get it to start playing...,"Whatever other features this has - and I don't care for a lot of gadgetry - I just want the thing to play and play well. I have no gripes about the quality of the sound or the comfort of the headphones. I just have to press the play button 20+ times (no exaggeration) to get it to start playing the CD. And these aren't bootlegged or imported CDs. But I'm stuck with it now. I've paid my money and by gum, I'm gonna play that thing. But save yourself some aggravation. Keep looking for something else. This ain't it."
5,"Transparent, honest and helpful","Michelle Bahret has written from the ""inside out"" with this important book. She gave a refreshingly honest glimpse into the mind and soul of someone struggling with a killer... eating disorders.Her honest portrayal of a person struggling with family dysfunction, her own rebellion and anger issues, and her final surrender to Christ as her ultimate answer and victory was forthright and illuminating. Committed secularists will no-doubt turn their noses up at this book, because it is so gut-wrenchingly honest and open about the Christian gospel. The post-modernist control-freak will disdain Michelle's bold proclamation that Jesus Christ is the ONLY viable answer to the human condition of brokenness. So, what else is new?On the other hand, there will be many who will find in this book a beacon of hope, and find victory!"
5,Escape To Reality,"Michelle's description of her abuse and eating disorder are deeply affecting. She takes us into that weird world where everything is warped by her addiction. We agonize with her as scheme after scheme fails to free her from the monster that has her life. It seems one step forward, only to fall two steps backward. Our sympathy is aroused for anyone thus ensnared.At last, Christ sets her free! But will it only be a temporyrelease, or will she slide back into an even darker despair?Yes, she still struggled for a while, but she didn't fight alone anymore. And so a great message is given to those who find Christ as their strength;keep on growing in your understanding of Him and His grace! Some miracles are instant and complete, others take a little longer!Thanks to Michelle for allowing light into a dark dungeon! May her fellow sufferers find the glorious escape that she did!Dennis Clough"
5,New Hampers!,"I love these hampers! They are so stylish and practical. Best of all I don't have to lug them up and down the stairs, just the bags that go inside!"
1,Irritating!,"I dont like these. I thought they would be great to have an all matching set for the bathrooms, closet, etc. I hate the way the fabric bag ties to it inside. When I take it out the wash once in a while it is a pain. So much so that they have sat downstairs in the laundry room for months now. I just don't use them anymore. THe fabric bag has torn so its really hard to tie. I'm sure there are a million better options. Not a good deal! I've even sold two of the piece this last summer at a yard sale. Only have the smallest backset on my husbands dresser for his things and the largest hamper downstairs being ignored."
1,Bogus Cover versions,Bad versions in a misleading package that makes it seem like you're getting the real songs by the original artists. DON'T BUY THIS!
2,Directions for Finding Nemo Game,"I wondered if there was any way to get the directions for the 'Finding Nemo' game? I bought it at a yard sale and didn't realize that the directions weren't there. Also, there are 47 instead of 50 tiles. Is it able to be played with that many. Since I haven't had a chance to play it yet, I wasn't sure if I should keep it or toss it. Thank you in advance for your help."
5,Great sequel to The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,"Once again, Maria Augusta Trapp captures your heart as she details some of the experiences her family had while giving concert tours all over the world. Always interesting, never a dull moment, and constantly remarkable. You won't want to put it down."
2,Unfortunate,"Good content, poor production quality. Half of the time, the male dancer's movements can be seen with great difficulty due to very poor lighting. The sound (music) from one of Gustavo's performace echos, probably due to audio equipment setup problem; very annoying. Camara work is OK; can be improved, but that's the least of the aforementioned problems."
2,is this a home video?,"I did enjoy the dancers. Unfortunately, the quality of the film is below average. From the flimsy cover (yes, don't jugde a book...), the sound, and most importantly, the lighting is awful - dark, dark, dark - and this movie was how much? A big disappontment. Who did those previous ratings anyway?"
3,A real shame...,"I had wanted to see this movie for some time because I love Kieslowski and rather enjoyed Tykwer's films that I've seen. Unbeknownst to me, I rented a movie that should have ended 30 minutes before it actually did. While the story started out well, it ended giving me the same feeling that I had with watching Nic Cage in City of Angels.....I just kinda felt like the characters sucked in ether and stopped participating in the film itself. I get the point of the movie but I don't equate pennance and guilt with walking around beautiful countryside wide eyed and saying very little. And I would never make a confession to someone who held obsessive love for me. Oh well....Overall the film is beautifully shot and the story does start off strongly. for the lay film watcher, i can't recommend this (my mom was very disappointed) but if your a fan of either director I suppose you should add it to yout ouvre of movies by great writers or directors."
4,Ribisi,"Kate Blanchett is indeed great and is the ""star"" of this film. I think Giovanni Ribisi is also (underappreciated and) great and should be given a lot of the credit for why this film is so good. (I confess, I have not read all the other reviews.)"
5,Excellent and intriguing film,Heaven is a gem that I discovered in a magazine that covers upcoming films. Director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run; Princess and the Warrior) provides a wonderful script that is only paralleled by excellent acting on the part of Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi. An excellent film.
4,Very Original,"****1/2Do not adjust your tv...you're going to think the entire movie is in Italian but be patient, it's in English (mostly) after the first couple of scenes. I'm guessing that Ribisi is Italian?...because he spoke the language like a natural, Cate didn't do so bad with her few lines either. Speaking of Cate, I still can't believe she pulled a GI Jane for this movie!Great film, great acting, and what breathtaking countryside scenery. A must see!"
3,Eh . . .,"I love Cate Blanchett as an actress, but this film did nothing for me. It was pleasant enough, but not engrossing. Not something I would watch a second time."
1,"Cate, we need to talk","Yeah, so Blanchett's character plants a bomb to kill a drug dealer. Where would an English teacher get a bomb in Italy, in a Boms-R-Us store? And why did not she simply unleash a Godzila on that bad guy? Then she faints and falls in love with a guy who has as much appeal as my supersonic toothbrush. And that's Cate Blanchett for you guys. Rejoice already. Then they shave their heads - a masterful plan to blend with Italian peasantry crowds. Great. Now what do you do when your shaving heads plan thing does not work? Jump on a helicopter and end the movie. I don't know... Sounds kind of stupid. Is it me or the movie?"
2,Ribisi and Blanchett are very good but the movie is so-so,"The beginning is the most shocking thing in the movie. Cate Blanchett bombs a building and she is taking away. She escapes fromt he help of Giovanni Ribisi and they run away together. Blanchett even shaves her head bald. Ribisi's and Blanchett's chemistry is very good but I just didnt feel very happy during this movie and it kinda turned me off a little bit but the 2 leads give honest performances. Good performanes, good story but for me it ran out of steam"
3,Vintage Bebe,"As a Bebe fan, I expect the strong smooth vocals as always but I think in this album what stands out is that it's all done acoustic. I didn't like it as much as his frist album ""Bebe Winans"" or his second, ""Love and freedom"" but this one didn't disappoint. Although I was somewhat disappointed with the arrangement of some of the songs, it is still good quality and the album isn't rushed. I do wish he would do a couple of tracks with Cece from time to time."
5,Fats and Friends,"I saw this on a German satellite channel 20 years ago, and I've always wished I'd recorded it.The excitement of everyone present came through loud and clear, and all the musicians gave outstanding performances.When I saw there was a DVD, it led me to make my first ever order to Amazon, and it has lived up to all my expectations. This is a buy that I will never regret."
5,FATS FRIENDS FANTASTIC,Fats Domino. Jerry Lee Lewis. Ray Charles. Three talented superstar musicians on one stage in one DVD! Who could ask for more???? Fantastic DVD! Buy it! Teri
5,"Fats, Ray & Jerry",I grew up in this era. Now a video starring the three greatest piano players from that period of time....WOW. It's beyond any words I could use to describe my feelings. I love this video and shall hold it as my favorite of all times.
1,It Ain't Worth The Money!,"The sound sucks on this DVD. The song selection is tiresome and Paul Shaffer looks like he needs a good hot bath and a bowl of soup! It's worth watching because we now know why Ron Wood plays guitar... because the guy sounds like someone is torturing a cat when he sings. He blows! I give it one star because Jerry Lee Lewis is still something to see. His first song, ""I Am What I Am"", is great and so is he and his guitar player Ken Lovelace. Ray doesn't have a clue where he is and Fats is okay but he looks like he's out there with a bunch of guys who just broke out of the Met Detention Center in New York City. Forget it."
5,9-LIVES?,IT WORKS ON THE HP VECTRA BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO LIKE VIA EMBEDDED CPUs. THE GHz IS TOO SLOW@600 MHz
1,Outdated and did not work correctly,"For what this redhat workstation cost me, one would think that it would work like it should. Software patches, how many bugs can this Redhat have, I have never seen so many patches to download in my life. I spent hours downloading and the system would hang up and quit responding! How any can say this is worth 5 starts, maybe a NEGATIVE 5 rating!This has to be the biggest over-rated bunch of NON-working software I have ever purchased. If you liked Windows 3.1 then this is for you. Not only that at least Windows has applications, this Redhat has a bunch of apps that don't work, or you can't figure them out......"
1,Too much trouble,"If time was money I would be a rich woman after spending hours with my pc thanks to linux. It is about as easy getting devices to work as have dental work without numbing medication. Whoever states that Linux is cheaper to run than Windows does not own a business. It costs more money in the fact it never works right or you have a application crash with a 'SEGV' error. AGGRRR, I think now I have some very expensive coasters for drinks... I am going back to Windows something that WORKS!"
3,OK little collection of Wood sketches,"Wood is known as one of the early Mad magazine artists, but it's nice to see some preliminary sketches of his other work here. With examples of various genres, including both ink and pencil drawings, this slim volume doesn't really have his best stuff. Woody's work has a slightly stiff and old-fashioned quality, but if you're interested in illustration or science fiction (especially of the 1950's), this is passable. A lot of weird and absurd images, obsessively rendered. I was struck by the long hours he must have put in. The bio describes the sad end of his life. For better examples of Wood's cartooning, get reprints of '50s era Mad magazines. For his classic sci-fi illustrations, ""Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood"" has more to offer than this book, but it's much more expensive."
3,Well it works,"According to the photo, the pig tail looks attached. It is not attached. You have to know if the fan runs clockwise or counter-clockwise. Like i am going to know that. So, I installed the fan w the blades running backwards, had to cut the wires and purchase another small harness. Also, there is a hose attachment on the top of the fan. I don't really know what hooks up to it, but all seems to work just fine"
2,seems very dated,"This book seems very dated for having been published in the 80s. The patterns are pretty simplistic, and, in my opinion, lack appeal. The book is 144 pages long, and there are only 4 pages in color. To me, the only redeeming point of the book is that is has some black-and-white photos of classic samplers worked in the 1700s and early 1800s."
3,"Bruce Wilkerson, The dream Giver - DVD","This message was well presented,and the concepts seemed sound, but I was disappointed that there was little,if any reference to scripture."
5,A great guide for dreamers,"This video series has helped me make sense of my entire life! If you have an unfulfilled dream for your life, this teaching will explain why and also how you can grow to become a person who fulfills dreams.Dr. Wilkinson's teaching is engaging, systematic, and funny. I was nodding along with his studio audience, acknowledging my personal experience of the trials and heartbreaks of trying to follow a dream.The personal anecdotes Dr. Wilkinson uses throughout the series beautifully illustrate his teaching points with unforgettable, sometimes gut-wrenching power. A must have guide for frustrated dreamers."
1,Not what I expected,"I generally like the work of Bruce Wilkinson, but this DVD was not worth finishing. I found the entire concept to be vague and found no basis for what makes a good dream that is worth persuing and one that is not worth persuing. I do not recommend it."
5,Loved the book!!!,"Read this book in 2 hours! Could not put it down. Thisbook is for anyone begging God for their dreams to cometrue, or for anyone who isn't sure what their dream is.Love the parable of ""Ordinary."" Buy this book!!"
5,"Not Just A ""Guy"" Book","This was my first Roger Welsch book not devoted to restoring old tractors, they do get mention in Diggin' and Piggin' but the book is so much more than just nuts and bolts. I've shared my copy with men and women, women enjoyed it every bit as much, more perhaps even more than the men. This book rivals another of his books ""Everything I know about Women I learned from my Tractor"". If human relations interest you this is a book for you. If hard core tractor stories are your interest go on along to some others by Roger, they are all that and a few foul words from twisted off bolts also."
2,great player until it died,"Add me to the set of users who were delighted with the player's functionality... until its demise at the age of only 18 months, with the classic H07 error.I used to hold the Panasonic brand in high regard, but it'll be a while before I buy their products again."
2,bought 2 lemons,"I bought one for my Mother in law for Christmas, Her's started acting up after 2 months. I bought the same model for myself at the same time. Mine broke after 4 months. Panasonic only covers labor for 90 days. I spent a few dollors more on a Panasonic instead of a no name brand because of the Panasonic name, I thought I was getting something better, I found out that I was wrong. I will think twice next time I buy a cheap Panasonic product. I recomend staying away from this model. I would still purchase a Panosonic but not there bottom of the line."
1,Garbage,"Don't buy Panasonic DVD players. Go to Google and do a search on Panasonic and H02 errors. Their DVD players die quickly. Mine died within about six months and I only watched about two movies a month. What's more Panasonic wants to charge quite a bit to fix it and from what I hear, once fixed, it will die again in another six months. A company that doesn't stand behind their products doesn't deserve our business. Don't buy Panasonic."
3,Book,Was exactly what I wanted just wasn't in good shape and proceeded to fall apart after a few days' use
2,It's a text book.,"It's a literature text book. that's about it. it has that nice new book smell. and that's the only advantage it has. if you have to buy the book, just get it unless you're confident you can find all the stories online or at your school library for free. Myea, nothing special here.Also if you're a lazy student, keep in mind that this thing is a good 2 or so inches thick and kinda heavy."
5,This is music-making at its absolute best,"For me, there is a kind of joy that comes from listening to great musicians who are working in real harmony, and really enjoying what they do. I have had this album 6 months, and have listened to it more than any other, and each time appreciate it more. It always lifts me up. This album is about ensemble, togetherness and listening. If there is an ego in this band, I can't hear it. It is about having a really good time, with gentle tracks, funky tracks - always thoughtful - a depth in the music beneath. Among the continuous excellence, some moments of genius level inspiration - the Dobro on Track 6 for example. I love most of what I know of Bela Fleck, both acoustic and Flecktone style. This is my absolute favourite."
5,WOW,"I purchased this CD knowing very well the virtuosic talent possessed by Bela Fleck. What I didn't count on was that the rest of the musicians on this CD each seem to be equally talented on their intruments. In 2 days, this CD has quickly rocketed to the top of my favorites pile. My favorite song on this CD is Macedonia; the energy displayed is just too good to believe. Buy this CD, it's worth it."
1,Not Bluegrass = Not Good,"I wanted this CD to be good, I really did. I love Bela Fleck. Edgar Meyer? Of course! Sam Bush? Genius. But this CD just blows. There is no way around it. When I first played it, I thought I had entered some kind of new-age aroma-therapy hut. I wanted to hear each player show off a little...get the heart pumping with some soaring mandolin melodies and quick banjo riffs. I didn't even need it to be fast, I just wanted some style, some bantering between the performers. All I got were lathargic, oozing melodies that could make a person go slowly insane. I know that the intent of the recording was to NOT focus on any one individual, but to play harmoniously as one group. Either these guys needed to play a lot more with each other or they needed to do a little showing off individually. If you're on the same track as my thinking, then I suggest Uncommon Ritual, an energetic recording that soars without any pink flamingos."
5,Wow!! You have got to get this album!,"I just finished listening to this album for the first time. I know it is not helpful if I don't say anything negative about this album, but I don't think there is anything negative to say! Without a doubt this is one of the strongest albums I have ever heard. At times it reminded me of an early Spyro Gyra ""jam session"" album. It is tight with amazing synergies between the musicians and it has the same tremendous energy. I am not sure how to classify this music - bluegrass, jazz - whatever... It is just darn good music!"
3,There are better receiving blankets on the market...,I received these blankets for my baby shower and we hardly used them. My daughter was on the larger side and these blankets were too small to swaddle her in. We used these mainly to lay her down on for changing. I have since packed them away. I highly recommend any of the Koala Baby blankets. They have awesome receiving blankets that were larger and a lot easier to use for swaddling. You won't be dissapointed with Koala!
1,Too small to swaddle,"These blankets are Ok unless you want to use them to swaddle a baby - which was what I thought ""receiving blankets"" were supposed to be used for."
4,Nice light blanket for everything but swaddling,"These blankets are nice because they are small and light. I mainly use them as a cover-up when nursing or pumping in semi-public places (i.e. the car). It is so hot here in the summer, so this is a nice lightweight blanket, versus some of the other heavier flannel blankets. It is too small for swaddling, but I didn't buy them with that intention. If you are looking for a swaddling blanket or something warm, you might want to pass on these. However, I am surprised how often I have used them."
3,Too small,"These blankets were too small to swaddle my baby with, and he was only 6 lbs when born! I wish I would of seen the other reviews saying the same thing before I registered for them. They are good for a blanket in the stroller or car, but not for swaddling."
2,Too small for swaddling,"My biggest complaint about these blankets it that with rounded corners, they are too small for swaddling, which is what we primarily needed them for. By comparison, the Wamsutta blankets, which are supposed to be the same dimensions, are much more suitable for swaddling."
4,Beware the Pills!,"These are nice blankets: very soft, good size, durable. BUT they pill like crazy leaving lint absolutely everywhere on the first washing. Make sure you separate your laundry carefully! Carters (or The First Years) didn't have that problem."
2,Not good for large babies,"The main purpose for the receiving blanket is to swaddle infants to soothe and comfort them when it is time to sleep. We had a larger baby (9lb 6oz) but by no means abnormally large. These receiving blankets measure about 28""x28"" after washing and are too small to keep a larger baby swaddled"
4,The Soong Sisters,"There was a previous black and white documentary on the Soong Sisters and their brother, David, on television. I was particularly interested as I had met Soong Mei-ling (Mrs Chiang Kai-shek) when I was about ten, when she was in Britain in about 1942, trying to raise money for her husband's cause. I later met Soong Ch'ing-ling in a Buddhist Monastery on Lan Tau Island in 1958, and travelled with David Sung on a flight from Malaysia to Hong Kong in 1964.Soong Mei-ling was a very attractive-looking youngish Chinese woman (from my recollection)and the film does justice to her. Soong Ch'ing-ling was early middle-aged when I met her, and the actor who played David Sung was also a good likeness, although Sung Tzu-wen was somewhat slimmer when I met him.The film reviewed put the story of the family into a cohesive and interesting history of a remarkable family."
5,Excellent!!,"This is a excellent movie, without Michelle's back kick. Don't expect any action in this movie. You don't need it. This is a non-fiction story, about three sisters whose married with the three men who impacted greatly onto the modern Chinese history. Very good history lesson, described the confusing time in China througout 2 World Wars. You may want to review basic modern Chinese history before watching this movie. Sometimes it gets confusing. Maggie is fantastic, as well as Michelle. She can act wonderfully without flipping and kicking. This is a MUST SEE movie for Michelle's fun. It will open up your eyes."
5,Some of George Strait's Best Material!,"As a George Strait fan, I've made a point to buy each of his CD's as they are released and this one is among the best of the best. Romantic ballads, danceable tracks, and just plain fun music. This is what country music is all about!Classic western swing and honkytonk licks mixed with modern danceable styles will please all fans.This CD is destined to be an award winner for George Strait!"
3,"Good, but not Great","I bought this CD when ""I Just Want To Dance With You"" was his latest single on the radio. I loved that song so much that's why I bought it. There's no doubt about it, this CD has some really good songs, such as, ""I just want to dance with you"", ""One step at a time"", ""True"", ""Remember the Alamo"", ""That's the breaks"", ""Why not now"", and ""You haven't left me yet"". I was greatly disappointed in the song ""Maria"". This song has a great melody and could've had great lyrics but it was tainted by the fact that he's having an affair with the girl. George doesn't need to sing songs like this. George doesn't sound good singing a song like this anyway. Overall, it's a good CD. Stay ""Pure"" Country George and you'll do great!"
2,George's worst album to date,George Strait is the best country singer out there today and he has been the best for so many years but on One step at a time I heard such a bad Nashville Pop kind of sound he just did not sound like his usual self. The singles were terrible except True but even that song isn't typical George Strait. What the heck is with all of the slow ballads on here and they are long songs to some of them go for just under 5 minutes. George Strait luckily bounced back to his usual self in Always never the same and by 2001 The Road less Traveled was such a better album full of great singles and better songs George Strait is still going strong today with new songs and will be around for many years and I hope this album gets put away forever because it stinks!
3,"Not the typical George Strait album, but not bad","I bought One Step At A Time because I couldn't get enough of the song, ""True."" I also liked the hits ""I Just Wanna Dance With You"" and ""We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This."" However, after listening to the rest of the songs, I sort of thought that this album wasn't the typical George Strait album; especially not when you compare it to some of the other great ones such as Carrying Your Love With Me and Blue Clear Sky. The only songs I liked other than the 3 hits were the title track and ""Remember The Alamo."" I thought the rest of the songs were just mediocre and not up to the usual George Strait standard.Overall, if you're a George Strait fan, I would recommend getting this album. But if you only get a few of his albums, this is not one of his best."
1,A View From Down Under,"Being a pure George Strait fan, and a person with appreciation for all types music, its no surprise that Mr Strait once again, has excelled in his choice of songs to compile on this CD. As a leading New Zealand Line Dance Instructor, there's many great dance tracks including the up tempo We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This', and the remake of the old song ""I Just Want To Dance With You"" but also the songs which warm the heart and engross you in the story of the song."
1,Critical review.,This work is not consistent with most studies published in the literature. The methods and techniques are suspect. I have personal knowledge of the clinicians involved and know they have sub optimal skills using the technology.
1,Waste of money,"[[ASIN:B000BKZI5G Hot Spa Foot Bath Massager with Vibration & Heat #61335 This product was not what I expected. Ist's a joke, the way the water gets hot is from your tap. The vibration is only slight. For what this product cost it was not worth half that much."
2,Bad production values mar album...,"The album sounds like it was recorded in a self-storage locker or something. The musicians seem more than competent and the arrangments are interesting-sounding, which is something to be said, for sure. Andrea Summer's vocals are nasally and occasionally flat, a bad impression of Natalie Merchant or something, but perhaps that's just a victim of the weak production, or the lack of numerous takes to get it right. Lyrically, most of the songs are adequate, but a few, such as Melanie, sound like bad jr. high poetry unfortunately. If she could get some good lyrics and a smooth professional production to go along with the excellent musical arrangements, she'd probably stand out some from the pack."
4,Clever satirical Scots adventure,"An expat Scot, I had great fun reading this book which also impresssed me on a deeper level. At the very beginning I was surprised at what I thought was just a concentration of black humour. As I am a great fan of Lee Child, Michael Connelly and yes Clancy and Grisham too, I am more used to plots and characters described far more ""seriously"". However, as Brookmyre introduced the participants of the school reunion and the tale enfolded, I was hooked. There are many facets to this story which is a thriller with unexpected laugh-out-loud situations. Violent and hilarious on the same page as life can be with salient observations about love, friendship, envy and disappointment. This is an original and cleverly crafted novel. It is a satire that is funnier than it is ""stinging"" or ""biting"" making it all the more effective in my view. I am delighted to have ""discovered"" Brookmyre and I will certainly be ordering more of his books."
4,"Great book,.....couldn't put it down","I have just returned from a holiday where I read this book. It only took 2 days !, I couldn't put the damn thing down. My wife was most displeased !! I have been sitting on this book for about 5 years but never actually read it. Surfice to say I am glad I finally did. If you can find it, it is a must."
5,i want to find this book,"i have just met someone who says this is the best book he has ever read, and i want to find a copy for him - he lent his to someone and never got it back (same old story) if anyone in great britain knows where i can get a copy please email me at nicky@wainman.com"
2,Not as good as I thought.,Not as good as I thought. It is heavy and after laying it over the pool table for just over 2 weeks it has started sagging at the center.
3,4 low-budget SF epics from the 1950s,"Packaged in a nice black-lacquered wooden storage case, this DVD collection includes the movies ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger: Crash of the Moons"" from 1954, the 1959 classic ""The Killer Shrews,"" 1954's ""Killers from Space"", starring Peter Graves, and ""Phantom from Space"" from 1953.You may have enjoyed a couple of these films when they were made fun of on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""; if not, then you've probably never heard of any of them. In any case, either you enjoy this sort of low-brow entertainment or you don't, and I doubt that anything I say here will convince you otherwise. Look up these movies in your favorite movie guide for more details, you may find them listed in the category of ""so bad that they're good""."
1,Think Twice,"Product seemed good - installed easy and went through setup. But doesn't have drviers to make it work for Windows XP. I tried to contact manufacturer which isn't possible. I even searched web for over an hour for a driver that would make it work - couldn't find one. So for the one I bought, and the driver CD that came with it, it is completely useless. Plan on returning if I still can and have already ordered another one from a different manufacturer that works fine."
2,Manufacturer out of business,"The manufacturer is out of business, so info might be scarce.I use the card on Linux"
3,Standard Card,"When I tried to install the card, I found that it will not work in the new computer that I bought. It is a PCI bus rather than the PCIE bus. A day or two of research led me to the correct card which I ordered from another source.All was not lost as I decided to upgrade the memory in my old computer and retain it in case the Windows 7 computer proves unsatisfactory. The PCI card fits there, so I now have 3 serial ports plus some USB ports in my XP Pro computer."
2,Dull,"I bought this book after reading the online chapter, which I loved. My intent, was to eventually buy a copy for each of my CCD students (7th grade). The first chapter was interesting, but as the book progressed, on every page I found my mind wondering out of boredom. Reminding myself that I wsn't reading for my own enjoyment, I pressed on. Chapter 5, ""Newman and 'Liberal' Religion"" began as a sensible condemnation of relativism (what Newman called Liberal religion), which Weigel then conflated with a defense of U.S. political neoconservatism. I then skimmed the chapter on the great Chesterton, thinking I might share at least that one with my students, but it was a dull as the rest."
4,it's durable but bulky,"this is a nice and durable case for your treo .. I bought it 4 years ago, and it is still intact. However, it adds too much weight to the phone and if you keep it in your pocket, it gets bulky. That's the case with every carrying case for phones I guess."
4,Rare book that explains each flower&#65533;s role in the history,"There are many books that tell gardeners the growing conditions and requirements of different flowers. However, rare is the book that explains each flower's role in the world's history and literature, as well as their medicinal uses and, the roots of each flower's botanical and common names. That is why Bobby Ward's A Contemplation Upon Flowers, which traces the history of eighty plants from the time of the Greek's to today, is such a treasure.This book is a must have for any serious gardener. Bobby Ward reveals long lost secretes about some of the world's favorite gardening plants that until now where lost and hidden in books and manuscripts that have been out of print for ages. Just when I thought I knew almost everything about some of my favorite plants, this book revealed a wealth of information about their long lost histories."
5,plant/flower lore,"Packed with a rich amount of myths, facts, history, & lore. Both scientific & mystical.If you love this sort of thing, you will not be disappointed here. So much amusing fact & fancy about each flower & plant, whether it's uses in health & cures, or said to give courage. uses in perfume, flavoring food. Legends of fairy queens, herbalists, monks, American Indians are only some of this great folk lore. the author is not stingy with information, he gives a goodly amount in a cheerfull manner with tenderness & respect for our flowers. I enjoy it immensly & will keep it around for future reference."
3,Genre for This Film Should be: HORROR!!!,"Regardless of what anybody says, to me this film was dramatized propaganda. It has certainly drawn out my anxious hostitlity towards the evergrowing radical Islamic population.It seems that the only thing that will appease the extremists would be for any person of a different faith to study the Koran and then allow the violent Islamics to distort the writings just read. Then actually convert to Islam and then, turn into suicide bomber, thus killing those of different faiths and, according to these extremists, get their tickets to Heaven.It's like watching the emergence of a huge Cult whipping up a lakeful of Koolaide.I am old, but I wonder how the younger generations will manage to live on, with the increasing threats and inevitable destruction of other religions.Was ""The Stone Merchant"" an entertainment or a warning?"
1,Martnelli's evil political engineering !!,Mr. Martinelli always tries to express his false (or specially ordered) ideas in his films.Neither Turks are like shown on this film nor they are connected to Islam so radically. Actually they have never been radical islamist in the history but they used it to rule and have always been protector of all beliefs inside their borders.If you want to be disinformed and brainwashed then go ahead and buy this.
1,A nasty little film where every single muslim in the film is a terrorist,"They go on vacation to Turkey, a country I have greatly enjoyed regular visits to, and even their chance encounters are entirely of terrorists. The husbands role as a university lecturer is used to deliver (repeated !) narration that The West has to wake up and realize we should be at war with Islam. Every single muslim in the film is a terrorist and every christian an innocent. Every mosque speaks hatred and there are no other voices shown. The message is so blunt in this film. Nobody outside Washington memo readership could be distracted enough to believe this. Blatant rally the public propaganda. Really quite shocking if you have spent any time enjoying the hospitality of these parts of the world. Produced in Italy and the UK and I have to wonder who financed this. It is clearly motivated by a wish to incite hatred. Hopefully its clumsiness will cause it to fail."
2,Too much information taken from the Internet,"Fortunately, I bought this book new, for 1/3 of the list price from an Amazon affiliate, which tempers my annoyance with the poor quality of this book. While I appreciate the honesty and avoidance of plagurism by listing the sources of the information, nearly every article in the encyclopedia is taken from the Internet. If you can use Google, you can find the exact same sources online. This might be a decent resource for a high school library, but not for anyone seriously interested in organized crime."
4,The Ultimate Transformer of fans,"I have a 50 year old house with not very good central air. By using these fans horizontally over floor registers, I'm able to get the cool air off the floor and up to head height, considerably improving my cooling. In the spring I put them in windows. That way, if I draw the blinds down to the top of the fan, I'm able to walk around the house in complete privacy (you can't do that with other window fans) and get some fresh air in.They are quiet and unobtrusive. In my living room they're virtually unnoticable. I keep fans running 24 hrs a day for about 5 months a year, no problems.The only reason they don't get a 5 star rating is that the breeze they produce is not very strong. If you want something that is strong, you'll have to get a traditional fan. None of the column fans are as efficient as the big bladed circular fans."
1,"This DVD is a reallity show, you can see this for free on TV.","You are not going to learn to dance with this video, not even closeas entretaiment could be fun, but you don't need to pay for this DVD when you can she reallity shows for free on TV."
3,"Cyrus Hall McCormick, His Life and Work","This short text was informative, but difficult to read because of the poor reproduction quality from the original. Sentence structure was almost non-existent. However, it does allow access to a book not otherwise available."
3,Basic information provided,"Interesting ""History channel"" documentary, providing viewers with basic information on the roots of the 2006 war in Lebanon; among which Hezbolah's origins (due to the 1st Israeli occupation of Lebanese land from 1982 till 2000), the kidnapping of the two Israeli soldiers', its fundamental requirements for their liberation (release of Palestinians prisoners from Israeli jails, among whom Samir Kuntar - a druze Lebanese accused of murder of a father and daughter in Israel back in the seventies) its ties with Iran. On the other side, the role America played in this war and its ""unofficial"" support to Israel beyond this invasion.Well filmed but certainly not recommended to the ones who want to go beyond the basic concepts of this war...I would say there was nothing new in this from what heard and documented on TV during the summer of 2006."
2,Not Worth Your Time--Maybe the Book is Better,"Let me first say I am a fan of Dickens and a fan of BBC productions like this. Although I haven't read The Old Curiosity Shop, this DVD version was enough to convince me to skip the book. Even compared to other Dickens' works, the story here is overly dark, morbid and depressing. As for the production, the cinematography was fine as well as the casting. Unfortunately, there was not enough character development to make me care or sympathize with the main characters as they experienced tragedy after tragedy at the hands of a very creepy villain. The end came as a relief. Recommend you skip this one--maybe the book was better."
3,Curiosity Shop,"I do love Charles Dickens. I think he was a genius, a remarkable writer. However, This story is so very sad. It does show the period and the poverty in 19th century England but it ends so sadly. It is a good movie but is very sad."
2,not very good,"I have not read the Dickens original but I suspect that this is not a very satisfactory dramatization. Parts seem to go very slowly and other parts seem rushed. The story also is rather humdrum Dickens: incredibly angelic people and utterly despicable ones. The baddies come to a bad end, and usually the sweet and innocent ones find happiness at the end. In this case, Little Nell, who is sweetness itself, dies, so there is an unexpected twist there. The actress who plays her suffers from the ""BBC affliction"": she doesn't speak words much of the time but makes little mousy noises to show how sweet and demure she is. As a result you need to subtitles to know what she is saying. Happily, there are subtitles without which much of the DVD would not be intelligible. I like Dickens, but I got bored watching this one third of the way through and hurried through the subsequent scenes to get to the end. I may go back when I muster the patience to do so and watch it all the way through."
5,The Old Curiosity Shop,"We got it very promptly, and in perfect condition. It was great to come back from a vacation and have it waiting for us. I like anything that Derek Jacobi is in. He is such a great actor."
1,Very Poor Adaptation,"A friend of mine told me they are going to be showing this again on PBS. Don't waste your time. After a very good Bleak House, I thought that ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" would be wonderful also. It was not; Nell was miscast (the actress was far too old), the ending was changed, characters were unrecognizable from the book, in short, the whole thing was a thrown together mess. If you just read one chapter from the book, you will do yourself more good than sitting through this production."
3,The Old Curiosity Shop,"My husband and I did not think this particular version of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" was too worthwhile. The film was dark and hard to see and some of the acting was not to our liking. Just our opinion."
5,Dickens put his foot down!,"What I like best about the Old Curiosity Shop was what the author himself did. When this was written, it was issued in serial numbers, meaning Dickens would issue chapters at a time, such as 1-3, 4-6, and so on. As he progressed in the story, people became enamored of ""Poor Little Nell"" and what would happen to her. The Inimitable (Dickens) had gotten wind of this, and simply decided enough was enough, and he'd rather write something else. People pleaded with him to have her live, including Charles Dickens's own mother, but he'd simply had enough. A great adaptation as it aired here in the U.S. on PBS. Happy 200th Mr. Dickens!"
3,More Interesting Although Loosely Based in Literature,"I liked this movie.The pacing is fast compared to the book, yes parts are left out...I'm okay with it.You don't get to learn as much about Nell's character in the movie though(she's a sort of a shallow character to begin with---description wise) and it's hard to follow when things are going fast.But the main idea of the story is clear. The costumes, lovely props, and supurb acting (specifically from Mr. Quilp and background characters) adds to it all.Not my favorite Dicken's story...it runs basically like a parable on money.The movie is okay."
4,Great small GPS,"Nice GPS, but lacks memory. However it's very reliable as most Garmin GPS. Currently being used on my motorcycle and it works extremely well. Recommended!!"
1,Royal pain and a waste of money,Save yourself a ton of grief and avoid the whole Garmin line. Product support is just sad.(NO joke) Nearly impossible to register and thier site is more into selling upgrades than provding service. The Streetpilot i2/i3 itself is buggy and not at all user friendly but far better than their 800 number. Get Tomtom or buy a map.
4,Great GPS for the Money,"This is a great little unit. It is good for entry level in the GPS world. Now that I have a taste of using a GPS I would like one that is a little larger, color display and a touch screen.This one can be a little slow and cumbersome when entering in an address. If you are an occasional GPS user then this is the unit for you. Very accurate and easy to use. If you use this for work like me (real estate agent) then invest in a larger unit with touchscreen entry."
4,More than a toy,"The Garmin i2 is my first GPS device. Though I rarely get lost, the price has come down enough to justify its purchase as a toy.However, I was pleasantly surprised that the i2 is more than a navigator. The i2 dug up many local stores, restaurants, etc. that I was unaware of. Now, I make sure that my i2 is on board before making a non-routine trip.As for its navigation capabilities, the i2 is not so intelligent as moi. However, that is not saying much (LOL). Seriously, my i2 is quite intelligent. I have recommended it to my family and friends. You might want to look into it, too."
2,Garmin i2,"I bought this thing because I only know my way around certain areas by landmarks ( yeah typical woman) but it's easier for me to understand "" Ok make a right by the pink house and when you see the yellow school you're there"". I know I know what happens if one day they decide to paint that pink house blue...I'm screwed aren't I???So I get this thing home load the map, go outside, get in my car and I wait and wait and wait for a satelite signal and Nothing!!I sit for 30 minutes in my car and zilch zero nada.No signal!!I mean long do you have to wait for a stupid signal anyway???I don't know maybe I was doing something wrong or maybe the thing was defected.I ended up sending it back and decided to go to BestBuy and have one of the guys there show me how to use it.( and tell me what I was doing wrong.)I gave it a 2 because it didn't work for me of course if it did work I would've probably given it 5 stars."
5,great product with reasonable price,"I find this little gadget totally useful and reliable. Most important of all, the price is absolutely reasonable!! If you just want something to tell you how to go somewhere, this is what you should get.!!"
2,"Directs you into buildings, hope you've got good insurance","All kidding aside, the fit and finish of the device, and look of the maps on this device are top notch. However, the maps apparently are not updated as frequently as Garmin would like you to believe. We were directed to driving directly into the wall of a store that was built a few years ago. Also, directions on freeway splits aren't obvious or accurate at all. Buyer beware, if you need to return to Amazon because of these reasons, they will charge you about $60 for doing so."
4,Does the job,"I have been using it mostly in New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia, Minnesota and Washington DC. The GPS is a slow thinker and therefore you can easy miss a turn if you have several turns in sequence right after the other. Also when you make a wrong turn it can take up to a minute until the i2 gives you new directions. When out side of the city center the i2 works better since there are larger distances between turns.I give it 4 stars since it is relatively cheap and with some slipups here and there it does the job."
3,Cheap GPS Unit w/ Voice,"Yes, Garmin has managed to pack in a lot of goodies into this little GPS unit, but the followings are problems I have experienced with this unit so far:1. No difference between ""best-time"" and ""shortest route"" search method---At least I couldn't tell the difference.2. No difference between all the different vehicle types---Yup, I even tried the ambulance mode, and good thing this isn't used in a real ambulance.3. Poor signal receiving ability---Yeah, that external antenna helps a little.4. Keeps telling me to get off hwy---Is hwy really suicide? Am I living in the Matrix?5. Screen too small---Staring into it can be a real driving hazard.Again, I guess you get what you paid for."
3,"works, but is a hassle for those who arent very e-literate","I bought this gps for a parent for christmas. It works fine(though they'll need a larger microSD/transflash card for the maps they want on it), but it took them a long time to figure out. The person I bought it for spent many hours on the phone with customer service, some of whom would disconnect her, before finally getting help(someone from Garmin actually had to remotely connect to her computer and install something for her that wasnt on the mapping dvd the product came with). Even after loading the maps and getting the product to work, she had to do some kind of secret reset code(a series of buttons, not in the manual), in order to get it to find the satelite signal. All in all the person I bought it for likes it, and it does do it's job just fine, but I would have gladly paid more for something more user friendly, to avoid the extra hassle."
3,Good inexpensive device.,cheapest talking gos system i could find. has maps of several regions each of which covers several states. voice is loud enough to be heard at highway speeds with radio on. display is black and white but bright enough to be seen any time of day at most angles. display brightness is adjustable. is very accurate on highways and even paved country roads. loses satellite connection from time to time for up to 15 seconds but always reconnects and resumes where left off. scroll wheel control is slow to use and mine sticks when pushed in even as brand new. recommend spending the extra money for a color touch screen unless you need the most basic map based gps system with voice. if you program in the address before you leave the driveway it will definitely get you where you are going using the best route. screen is big enough. B+ considering it's price
4,well worth the money,"I work in homecare and my area is very rural. Its hard to find addresses on maps or mapquest. The streetpilot i2 is amazing. I enter the address and away I go. Never get lost. The only problem that I have encountered is that sometimes it's wrong when it comes to right or left when its telling you which side of the street the address is located. It usually pretty easy to figure that out though. I would highly recommend this. I used to spend about 1 hour every night planning the next day on mapquest, now I don't have to. It paid for itself very quickly. I do recommend purchasing the friction mount, it stays put."
4,Daughter's present,"It is smaller than my ""full size"" Garmin but the daughter seems to be perfectly satisfied with the unit and it's performance."
3,Good entry level device,"If you're not big into GPS but want an affordable model to get you where you're going, this is a pretty good choice. I agree the black and white screen is not an issue, because you tend to go by the voice prompts. The device itself seems to take a LONG time to find satelites when you first turn it on. Also, it's only as good as the data from the CD -- you'll find that new subdivisions and shopping centers (like a few years old) won't be found. Also, when loading your data, pay attention to how much space you have; you can really only fit a couple of states on here at a time. We took it to Florida and discovered once we got there that half the state was missing, so major airports and whole cities we needed to get to were not loaded. You really need to double check that all the data you need is on there before you leave! The tech support was only mildly helpful in resolving this. Overall the unit works pretty well, especially for the price."
4,Useful for new drivers,"I brought the navigator in March 2006. It served me well till now. The black and white display is low on energy consumption. Initially getting used to ""keep-right"" (sometimes meaning drive straight ahead) and ""turn-right"" may be challening. Garmin may work on the clamp as it keeps on falling off.Otherwise the product is good buy considering there are options to save preferances (avoid highways, tolls, etc.)"
4,Broken in less than one week,"It seems like it was doing a good job of mapping and navigation, but less than a week after I got it, it had already broken. I'm currently waiting to hear back from Garmin tech support to figure out why it won't turn on, but I imagine that it will be going back to Amazon.I got a replacement and it seems to work just fine. I guess I just got a dud initially. (My review changed from a 2 to a 4.)My only real complaint is that it eats up batteries, even when not turned on, and rechargeable batteries don't seem to last for more than a few hours of actual use."
2,Great except 1 problem,"It is small and cheap. Its map seems to be missing large chunks of the world. Like exit 3 off 93 in NH.Also, the suction cup doesn't work. It falls every 5 min."
3,A good bang for the buck - but slow startup times..,"Very pleased with the I2 -The Good--------* the $75 less for the black and white screen is a super bargain - The display is very clear in all conditions* Fairly decent navigation capablities - have not beenlost after i got this guy - although a word of caution!!setting the ""Avoid Toll Roads"" options got me into a ""badneighbourhood!"" once - best turn it off! - guess garmin didntconsider that..!* picks up detours fast and -recalculates with decent speed -Really like the ""Avoid U Turns"" option at that..The Bad-------* Really slow Startup time to acquire satellite! Almost takes 5 - 10 minutes!* Garmin map software that ships with teh product is 2004 maps and roads are already changing!The bottomline--------------Great Product for the price - Best way to get your feet wet withGPS technology! and save time by not getting lost!"
3,CAMMMMMPY,"i'm a BIG FAN of batman brave and the bold [and the 90s series as well]. ever since DC's ""52"" comic book run, i've been a major fan of the C-list heroes and villains...however, i honestly didn't really like the freedom fighters. uncle sam? who gets his power from patriotism? blehh. and plastic-man isn't all that interesting to me either. what really got to me about this episode was the end....where batman pretty much turns into captain america. haha! bravo. not one of my favorite episodes, but its good nonetheless."
2,More for adults,"I'm not sure what age this is geared for but it has pretty mature topics. I had to turn it off, it was too much for my kids. In fairness, anything that references a ""death race"" in the title is really not kid appropriate - shame on me for not reading it but come on guys its Batman and should be somewhat kid friendly."
3,I NEED HELP ON THIS ITEM,I am looking for a cd player that can play mp3s. This one looks good and i have a few questions to someone who owns this product... does it play regular sized cds or does it only play the new minidisc things?? is it easy to control?? is the size small and compact? and my last question... whats ATRAC3? can you please explain what it is to me... thanks for your help please answer my questions if you want..
1,NOT an mp3 player!,"Shame on Sony for trying to sell a ATRAC3 player as mp3 player. I believe there's no mp3 decoder on this or if it is then its pathetic.192kbps and 256kbps mp3's sound like radio quality. The hardware is definitely not designed for mp3's but for Sony's copyright protected format.Save your time and get something which is a real mp3 player (iRiver, MPIO, Creative etc)."
3,Poor MP3 Sequencing,"It is nice that Sony supports ID3 tagging, but I don't understand the logic in using these internal MP3 tags to sequence the playing order of your data files. Winamp, and my old Philips CD-Player, both use the file name to sequence the playing order of the data files. I believe this makes more sense, because it makes the data files easier to identify, and gives the user more control of their content."
1,"Unreliable, cheaply made, poor design","I purchased this heart rate monitor and it has been collecting dust on my shelf ever since. It's completely unreliable as it rarely picks up my heartrate for any extended period of time, even after wetting the electrodes. The electrodes are tiny compared with any Polar brand model. Obviously, not much $ and thought when into the monitor's design. The watch is huge and ugly. For this amount of money, you would do much better buying a Polar FS1 which is just about the same price. That's what I did and I am thrilled with the Polar monitor!"
1,Very poorly made.,This knife is very poorly made. The picture looks better than the dagger I received. If someone offered to give me this dagger I would not want it.
1,Book needs proofreading,"This books lists Toronto defeating Montreal in the 1966 Stanley Cup playoffs, 4 games to 2. That must have happened on another planet because Montreal won the series, not Toronto. And it was 4 games to none. I haven't had time to check the rest of the book, but you would think that the author would have double-checked the data and proofread it. This was not a misspelling or transposed digits. I wonder what other errors were overlooked. If you want to be called ""The Official Encyclopedia of the Stanley Cup,"" you have to live up to the name. Let the buyer beware!"
1,Toronto did not win the Stanley Cup in 1966,"On page 43 of this book, it states that Toronto won the Stanley Cup by defeating Montreal to win the best-of-seven series, 4-2. In reality, Montreal defeated Toronto, 4-0. Before you post a review criticizing another reviewer, make sure you get your facts straight."
4,Feedback on car charger,"Great product, quick shipping. I did not have any issues with the product - simple, straightforward , clean processing :)"
4,Confusing book in confusing series of books,"I have no particular love for this book, but I don't really know what to make of it. It seems to contradict many of the things said in The Great and Secret Show, and some of the characters have lost focus(ie..Tommy Ray, Jo Beth, and Howie). However, every time I think Barker's full of it, he throws some twist in the story that pulls me back in. It's a confusing book to say the least, and he doesn't answer much at the end, but this is only the second book in a series, so I'm not sure if Barker's got something up his sleeve...There have been worse ""middle of the series"" books around that have still ended up good."
5,LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT,"THIS ISN'T HORROR! it's fantasy sheesh people. this was a great book (I love the character of Harry D'Amour, anyone know what else he's been in besides Great and Secret Show, Last Illusion/Lord of Illusions?)"
4,Second part was just as intriguing read first,"I loved this book.. it really got me back into reading after months of taking a break from picking up a book. At first I was daunted by the length. I admit it! But by the end I wished it were double in pages. I hated that the story ended and that is a true mark of an enjoyed story. Now I'm reading the first part and am able to make all these connections with characters referenced before that were never rightfully introduced (ie Jaffe, Fletcher, Kisson). The order hasn't confused me too much. I feel like I know secrets that these characters don't. I know how the story ended before it began. After The G and S Show I know I'll be wishing there was a part 3.. Maybe Barker would consider. There are still a million stories on the story tree..and I for one would love to read another book of the Art."
1,EVERVILLE IS EVERYTHING BACKASSWARD!,"You gotta understand that you should ignore the 1 rating; itsrating should really be a -10. Or maybe a -10i, as in imaginarynumbers, for the chaotic storyline that this here was lends an imaginary legend to Mr. Barker still having what it takes to entertain and shock people with his horror jive. (Hey Clive! Go back to short stories; relearn how to stroke the ideas, man! And quit trying to be a British cowboy! You just ain't cutting it, dude! Or maybe even coming off as just another vapid television series of compressed hot air passions and equally inconsequential intrigues is what's turning you on these days? Who knows?)"
5,One of Clive's best,"This book forces one into a world of imagination like no other book has to me before. The beginning is fairly dull, but the rest of the book makes up for that. You probably should read the Great and Secret Show first, but the imagery and character development is good enough to read it in reverse order, honestly."
3,"OK sound, for a little while","For the first few days, these strings sound fine. Maybe, as others have said, better thanD'Addario EJ16-3D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light, 3 Sets. Maybe not: I don't have a set of each on 2 different guitars, so it's hard to tell.Regardless of the initial sound, the joy of playing them is short-lived. For a couple weeks of daily play, maybe, they sound fine. After that, they sound a little dull. I switch tunings a lot, which probably shortens their playability's lifespan. Considering price and sound quality, they seem more expensive thanElixir Light Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings.Strings and picks are about the cheapest ways to experiment with a guitar's sound. These were worth a try, but I likely won't use them again."
4,Not bad,These strings I put on my Taylor GA4E. They had a very nice and balanced mids and highs. These strings fit very nicely for a acoustic guitarist that is playing with a bassist and supporting instruments. These strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely. Nice mids and ringing highs. Not a lot of bass. But very nice balance as I said. YMMV.
3,oh doug,"yes ok so i bought this DVD along with season 1, dont buy this one.. but it from another company.. for real . it like wont work on my DVD players and i have about 4 of them it only worked on my laptop...kinda upset with that...i love Doug still just upset over this DVD season 2.."
1,Won't play on my DVD player or laptop,"I was so excited when I saw that Amazon had Doug on DVD - but to my dismay, the DVDs won't play on my DVD player OR in my laptop (a Macbook Pro). So basically I just wasted $34. I hate to give my beloved Doug a 1 star rating but I have no other choice.Buyer beware - the DVDs may not play for you."
1,What camp did you go to.,"I dont think the author of this book every sat at a campfire, let alone told a scary story. The 7 and 10 year olds at our campfire got up and walked away and the adults just moaned. Nothing but goody two shoes morals for endings and no suspence. Make up your own stories instead of purchasing this book."
2,Ugh.,"A book wherein clichés pile up like a multiple-car accident, and with about the same screeching sound. Don't bother with this one - buy something interestingly-written instead."
3,Sad,I was told I could get this to play on my 360. You can't. It asks for some kind of internet download. Kind of a wate of money but I still wish I could play.
3,"Doesn't work on Xbox360, only Xbox",This game is not backwards compatible on the newer consoles ie Xbox 360 console.It will only work on the older consoles.List of games compatible.[...]
4,Lots Of Fun,I bought this game for my dad and I think I played it more then he did. I was alot of fun and I actually was able to beat it. Blowing tanks up in the UFO was probably my fav part. This is not a game for advance gamers but maybe just average ones.
2,"An OK read, but I was hoping for more","I just finished this book last night and I'm still feeling the ""huh"" factor. I was actually ok with following Sam, Marcus, and Phillip, but Lance and Asia's story was not told as well as it could have been. The chemistry between those two characters was enough to hold its own in a novel by itself. Why did it feel like their story was told as an afterthought? Sam's storyline bored me to tears; Marcus was a little boring, but got interesting towards the end (left me ""breathless""); I liked Phillip because he was such a caring father.A part of me was glad that Lance and Asia didn't end with everything wrapped in a predictable neat tidy bow like the others, but it still could have been better. I really hope we see those two characters again. There's no way they can end like that.All in all, this book was okay. Something to read when you have nothing else to do, but not a serious page turner like Ms. Jackson's other books."
3,Interesting..but could be more,"This is the first book I read by Ms Jackson. For the most part the endings to each character's story was predictable. I was surprised with the ending of the Lance/Asia storyline. Overall, it is a good, easy to read book. I would recommend this book for others to read, however there are other books with a similiar feel that I would recommend first. The writing has captured my interest to read some of Ms. Jackson's other works."
2,No Thank You,"I thought I wrote a review for this a few years ago, but I guess I didn't it just came up for me to write one after I purchased the book for someone else. I hope that she likes it...I couldn't get into it and refused to suffer through it. I wanted to choke the lady of the bookclub who suggested that we read it!!"
5,"Fish say ""yummy""",This is the same food I 'once' bought at my local fish store for 12bucks/10 grams or something like that. Amazon is WAY cheaper if you don't mind a bucket o food :-)The fish dig on it and it is one of the best foods out there.
4,High-flying action!!!!!!!!!!,"Yeah, this movie is great! Theres lots of high flying action, shooting, and exploding, which I personally always enjoy. This movie is pretty violent and is not for the faint of heart. Antonio Banderas plays his part to perfection. The only dumb annoying thing was that the guys kept switching from Spanish to English (or vice-versa) in the same conversation. Bottom-line is, i f you're looking for a violent, action packed movie to rent, this is the one."
3,Not a great sequal,"This movie was supposed to be a sequal for Desperado, however with the exception of Antonio Banderas being EL Meriachi, and a few glimpses at Salma Hayek it was a dissapointing and almost unrealated sequal to Desperado. Once upon a Time in Mexico was more of a seperate movie that tied with the Desperado legend. However this movie did have great action sequences and besides not continuing Desperado directly was a good movie to watch."
1,What Happened? This Is A Pice Of [edit],"I remember watching Desperado when I was a young teen and was totally blown away by it. But I'm sorry to say, I think the director was on drugs when he made this piece of garbage. It totally sucked! What ever happened to realism ever to a certain degree? This was like Tombstone meets the Matrix. Depp and Banderas did an excellent job though. But what the hell was this movie about? The dream scenes just added to the confusion. Why can't they just leave things alone instead of trying to make a few extra buck off a really good title."
2,Story/Acting: Terrible. Content : Great !!,"Ok so the movie is pretty terrible. So why own it?DEMODISC!If you have a high end video/audio system, you will want to use this as a demo disc, since it was shot in HD digital. Some of the visuals are just beautiful, and make an effective use of video scaling to higher def displays."
4,Action packed the whole way......,"I have three questions for you...1) Are you a Johnny Depp fan???2) Do you like movies with wierd and mind-boggling plots???3) Do you like action, suspense, comedy, and gore all in the same movie???If you answered yes to any one of these questions then I would say this movie would appeal to you. If not, please don't bother because you will not appreciate it.If you based this movie on characters...Johnny Depp would win...his character is humerous, sexy, vicious, and just all around Johnny! He ties the movie together and you cannot wait until you have a scene with him in it again.If this movie was based on plot...I would have to say that it is a bit slow and sometimes hard to follow but it can be comprehended fairly simple.Action...awesome...special effects...even better. ..."
2,A SAD DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE SERIES.,I must say that I expected alot more from this movie and I was ultimately disappointed.The plot of the movie was confusing and uninspired.There are alot of scenes which are unnecessary and make no sense such as the shooting of the cook.There are too many side plots to follow so one could easily get confused.Antonio banderas was seen very rarely in the movie and salma hayek was seen for only 5 minutes.Pointless violence and bad acting.This movie had so much potential to be good but it pales in comparison to desperado which was actually good.Trust me and do not waste your money on this GARBAGE!!!
4,JOHHNY DEPP IS SWEET,Of course i like this movie because my fav actor is in it Johnny Depp. The movie itself is interesting. Something i wouldn't watch if it didn't have Depp in it. I thought it was missing something but wasn't quite sure what .......other then that it was exciting and violent which those kind of movies get far this day in age.
4,It is what it is...,"If you didn't like any of the Mariachi films, don't waste your time. Don't expect things to particularly make sense. But, if for some unknown reason you are like me and love the Mariachi series, this one is a must. You just have to accept it for what it is, even if you can't really define it into a convenient pigeon-hole. I wish I could not like Johnny Depp and Antonio Banderas, but unfortunately they are just too good to not like.I hated Antonio Banderas just because he was so pretty...but when I actually saw some of his work I realized he is a great comedic actor. Nobody can do the deadpan line like Banderas (4 Rooms, even the 13th Warrior). The guy is dreadfully under-rated."
4,A Better DVD than a Movie,"If you loved El Mariachi, you'll love this.If you loved Desperado, you'll probably like this.OUaTiM has stylized shoot outs that made these films so fun. It also has the revenge-heavy, character-light approach that made these films guilty pleasures.The DVD has some great featurettes. Unlike some DVD's that have tons of content that no one would really want to see, this has a great tour of RR's home studio, a look how to make a feature film on the cheap and most importantly a cooking lesson (hmm...slow roasted pork.)"
1,Did I miss something?,"You know when you go into a theater with friends to see a movie you've been anticipating for ages, and then you look over midway through the movie in the height of your excitement to see your friend's reaction to the sheer awesomeness of the film, and they look bored and/or disgusted? Well, that friend was me. In a group of four, I was the only one who did not seem to find the true meaning of life in this film. I saw lots of guns, stuff blowing up, and a strange side of Johnny Depp. Yet, no connections were made in my mind. I feel like I must have fallen asleep during a crucial moment of this film, but that's doubtful. Maybe it's a genious of a film, maybe other people have no taste in movies. The world may never know."
3,A great cast but a mediocre movie,"This movie was a bit of a let down for me. I got all the mariachi movies at once and watched them in order. I liked the first two a lot and figured that the third would also be good. *sigh* Apparently I figured wrong. This movie was ok, but: Salma Hayek wasn't in it enough, the action scenes weren't really that great, and the plot was way more complex than it needed to be. If you want to watch one of the mariachi movies go with Desperado, not this one."
1,"Read the title, it tells u everything.","It's kind of sad to hear people rant and rave that this movie is too fake and would never happen in real life. Did they seem to just skip past the title? ""Once Upon A Time"" is how it starts, and the movie itself is more like a fairy tale. You can't sit there and anylise it, you just have to take it for the adventurous, high body count movie it is. Once u see past the non-sense people fill your heads with, you can tell it is a pretty good film. Not the top of the charts, and not for everyone, but a good film. Most of the credit goes to Johnny depp (as always) who seems to string everything together. I reccomend this movie if gunfights and gore doesn't bug you/"
2,Johnny Depp Is The Only Good Thing In This Movie!,"Once again Johnny Depp has 'saved' a movie from going completely bad. If it wasn't for him, I'd give this move zero stars. The story line skips around alot, their isn't much dialoge, and the casting is terrible! For example, Enrique Iglesias plays a gun-fighting super hero with really bad acting skills! However, what makes the movie worth two stars is the hilarious character Johnny Depp plays, Sans. With his unforgetable line, ""Here, would you like to try my pork?"" makes this the only good thing in the movie. Other than that, it's a dud."
3,Thank you Johnny Depp!,"Johnny Depp is incredible when it comes to humor. He wouldn't even have to speak, his facial expressions are enough. The only parts I found entertaining were Depp scences. The rest was very ordinary and not all that funny. If you enjoy watching a good actor, then watch it for that alone. If not, it's one to skip."
2,Once Upon a time in Hollywood,"What a let down. After all the hype and hooey. This movie really has no plot. Banderas really has no dialogue. And Salma Hayak really isn't in the movie, for more than 5 minutes if that. This movie is a shuck, plain and simple. If you have seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of the movie. Desperado is a great flick. OUATIM is absolute twaddle in comparison. Buy it used for half price if you have to buy it at all."
3,One Upon A Time In Mexico (***),"I waited for this film to get on DVD, due to all the bad reviews, plus I'm not a major fan of Robert Rodriguez (with the exception of ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Til Dawn"") so I felt I could wait out the DVD release. I'm kinda glad I did. I mean, the movie is O.K., but it wasn't as amazing as everyone claimed it was. Sure it was loaded with a ton of actions, but where's the story? I got so confused at the begining of the movie that I was about ready to turn it off. But, all in all it was a fair movie. A shoot-'em-up, western like feel with an amazing cast. As for all the rave over Johnny Depp's performance was just hype. He's O.K. in this movie, but it wasn't as amazing as I figured (the same rave over Depp's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" performance rated about the same as this). For a pretty good time, not too deep plot, check this out. Especially if you're a ""Desperado"" fan."
4,Karen's review of Once Upon A Time In Mexico,"I'll make this short. OK, so the plot was a little bit hard to understand the first time I saw it. But the second time, it was actually quite clear to me. Johnny Depp does an excellent job as usual. So did Antonio Banderas. All in all, it was a good action film."
1,"really, really bad","I'm far from picky when it comes to action movies - for example, I really enjoyed both ""The Transporter"" and ""Triple X"", both of which are basically fluff, but fun, well made fluff.That said, this movie is basically unwatchable - I came close to leaving the theatre early. No plot, no connection between scenes, nothing to make you even care what happens to the characters. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,"Stay away from this one, it's truly trash","I can appreciate campy, tongue in cheek, stylish movies, such as ""The Mark of Zorro"", (in the same style as this one) also starring Antonio Banderas, but where Mark of Zorro had truly endearing caracters, and loads of humor too, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is completely uninvolving and too serious. We don't care for a moment what happens to Depp or Banderas or anyone else for that matter. Even my 14 year old son (who can whatch some pretty awful stuff) finally said: ""jeez, this movie is STUPID!!"". I couldn't say it better myself."
1,Don't waste your money,"I went to see this farce on the big screen, I only paid $.50 for the admission. After the movie was over, I felt like asking for my money back! Mariachi and Desperado were good movies, and I guess I was expecting more of the same with Once Upon a Time..., what a disappointment. No vale la pena, actuacion y tema son de lo peor."
2,ONCE UPON A WASTE OF TIME ABOUT MEXICO,"Did we really need a third installment? For the third time Robert Rodriguez has remade EL MARIACHI. Other than stylish shootouts and a repeat of the same old themes there is nothing new here besides Depp, who ads a comedic dimension to the whole mess.It's a shame that RR wastes his time and talent on this when he is clearly qualified to tell much better and more meaningful stories with the rich history of Mexico as its back drop. What a waste of a talented cast who are obviously begging for something meaningful to do.Antonio Banderas returns again as the mariachi with and guitar case full of guns to save the Mexican President and shoot up the bad guy--Willem Dafoe. Good to see Mickey Roarke back on the screen.Don't waste your time with this POS."
3,Extremely Disappointing,"This was an extremely disappointing movie considering the first 2 in the series. Robert Rodriguez kept nothing of the drama and plot that made El Mariachi and Desperado fun to watch. Except for the characters themselves, there is no linkage with the originals. The only thing this film has is a lot of gun play."
4,Johnny Depp always steals the show and that always a good thing.,"This story maybe about El Mariachi but Agent Sands is someone you'll like more he's crazy,funny,and deadly now that is a cool anti-hero. I hear in the commentery in this movie and Robert rodrigez said that he had an idea to make a Once upon a time in mexico 2&3 and it would be two trilogies in 5 movies counting El Mariachi And Desperado. And that the new hero would be Agent Sands and that to me sound like a pretty neat idea. if you think that this is a good idea write it in your reviews so I can find out."
2,JUST PLAIN BAD,"People, this movie's plot went in so many directions it was impossible to keep up with it all. The story line twisted so many times it literally ruined the movie. Depp was convincing and funny and Banderas was his typical shoot em' up self, but these things just couldn't save the movie from its bizarre, all-over-the-place plot. Rent this one."
1,WARNING ZONE 1 ONLY,IF YOU HAVE A DVD THAT IS FROM OUTSIDE THE US - REGARDLESS IF YOU HAVE MOVED TO NORTH AMERICA THIS DVD WILL NOT PLAY ON A MODIFIED OR NON-ZONE 1 DVD PLAYER. INSTEAD IT GIVES YOU A MESSAGES THAT IT WORKS FINE BUT WILL NOT PLAY ON A MODIFIED DVD PLAYER. HOW FREAKING ANNOYING.
2,TERRIBLE!!!!,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of Johnny Depp. As always he overshadows everyone else in the movie with his dark humor and personality, despite the All Star Cast (Banderas, Hayek, Ruben Blades,Enrique Iglesias,etc.).But this movie turned out to be just a confusing and senseless bloodbath.Buy it only if you are a J.Depp fan. If you are looking for a fast paced fun action movie get Kill Bill Vol.1 or check out 2004's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", both are much better."
3,didn't dig it,"i saw the first half of this movie the other day (for some odd reason i couldn't finish it), which might not be because i thought it was bad, i can't seem to finish movies in one sitting anymore. this movie just kinda bored me, evne though it's 100 percent actionas in all action:as in no room for anything else:EXCEPT (the guitar interludes, which although were good, bored me)i'll finish the movie tonight, and if i have some kinda epiphany and its the greatest movie i've ever seen i'll come write 14 apologetic reviews to make up for this one, but i doubt it, even depp bored me (is it possible)"
2,More like 2 1/2 stars,"Loaded with bloody action and loads of explosions, the third film in Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi trilogy is an unnecessary, but somewhat fun, sequel. Antonio Banderas returns in the role that made him famous with Desperado, but his character and performance is outshined by the always fantastic Johnny Depp as the mysterious CIA Agent Sands who recruits the Mariachi for his own purposes. Salma Hayek's role is nothing more than a cameo in the beginning flashback of the film, and the colorful cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Rueben Blades, Danny Trejo, and Eva Mendes; most of whom go greatly underused. Once Upon a Time in Mexico is nowhere as great as either El Mariachi or Desperado, and the film would probably be a clunker were it not for Rodriguez' well crafted action scenes and Depp's film stealing performance. All in all, this is worth checking out for fans of Depp or fans of the Mariachi, just don't expect much from it."
2,growing on me,"I've had to rethink this film. I don't think it's as good as Desperado primarily because el mariachi is overshadowed by the convoluted plot. Nevertheless, the style and cinematography is pleasing. Depp as the sociopathic CIA agent steals a few scenes but doesn't quite steal the show (much like Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday in Tombstone). Rodriguez could have probably made a dark, comedic film just on Sands. Overall, the mariachi series is a fun trilogy and Rodriguez is an extraordinarily talented filmmaker."
2,Deteriorates into a depressing gross-out,"While ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" were stylish and fun, this is so violent and depressing, it's almost unwatchable, despite excellent performances by the lead actors. At points, the violence becomes simply sadistic to the audience, with horror-film-caliber torture sequences, and the characters are so non-chalant about shooting innocent people, it just wears you out. (Just a note: I'm a big action movie fan, but this is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre than John Woo. Methinks doing kids flicks like ""Spykids"" has made a monster out of Robert Rodriguez.)"
3,Disappointing....,"Compared to ""Desperado,"" it was a real letdown. The chemistry between Banderas and Hayek, so electrifying the first time around, was absent. Why was her part reduced to a cameo? The intensity of Banderas character was lost, or just not developed in this film. I love a good action film but.....You fly 30 feet when you get struck with a bullet? Characters who can scale a wall like a human fly? Nah! Just toooo much!!"
4,a great action movie!,"once up a time in mexico is one of the smartest movies of the fall season. A great sequel to desperado with even more originaland fun action sequences. Johnny Depp gives another quirky, funny, and entertaining performance. The ensable cast is great. the story is original and fun. One of the better action movies you are likely to see this year."
1,One of the worst films of 2003.,"Antonio Bandares, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, great actors right. I am not going to say bad things about them, but who ever wrote what could've been the corniest script since Gigli. ""Are you a MexiCAN or a MexiCAN't"" After an hour of torment I could'nt take it. I swear, I think Fidel Castro even hates this movie. The action was so often it got boring. The plot was very very unintriguing. Definately a don't see film."
1,Once Upon a Time in the Movie Theater,"Waste of time and money. Previews looked great. Script was disjointed and the audience got lost in time. Banderas is usually great, but he missed it this time. Too bad - beautiful setting and the audience could have been treated to an exciting western!"
2,Robert Rodriguez's most violent film,"This film is violent, gory, and full of profanity. There is one scene where the CIA agent (Johnny Depp) gets his eyes pulled out and he we see him with no eyeballs and blood all over his face. It is not good, just fair. Desperado was better than this."
4,Maravillosa!,"this was a really good movie. i haven't seen an action movie this entertaining in a looooong time and action movies aren't particularly my cup of tea but this was an outstanding movie. It's got it all, drama, explosions and a great storyline as well as great acting... the only thing else i could ask for would be the deaths of 2 particularly annoying people, one a pop singer and the other an American ex-pat living in France.... hope i'm not giving anything away..."
4,We are not all mexicans!,"Antonio Banderas plays a mexican in both Desperado, and Once upon a time in Mexico, but he is Spaniard(from Spain)."
2,Once there were some idiots who thought they could direct,"If I had known Desperado was going to have a follow-up I would have rushed to the store at once to find it, but in fact I just stumbled over it and I wish I hadn't.It continues where Desperado ended, showing scenes where Mariachi's (Banderas) girlfriend (Carolina - Hayek) is killed by her ex-boyfriend. A corrupt CIA agent offers him a deal he can't turn away : revenge.It works now and then, but too often it's too confusing and too many links and scenes that in my opinion could have been deleted and just left out, but then the movie would only be 30 min (OK by me).It's an OK movie if you have nothing better to do a friday night, but to call this the sequel to Desperado is just taking it TOO far."
5,"Read the title, it tells you everything","It's kind of sad to hear people rant and rave that this movie is too fake and would never happen in real life. Did they seem to just skip past the title? ""Once Upon A Time"" is how it starts, and the movie itself is more like a fairy tale. You can't sit there and anylise it, you just have to take it for the adventurous, high body count movie it is. Once u see past the non-sense people fill your heads with, you can tell it is a pretty good film. Not the top of the charts, and not for everyone, but a good film. Most of the credit goes to Johnny depp (as always) who seems to string everything together. I reccomend this movie if gunfights and gore doesn't bug you/{I Realize this has been posted before, I gave it the wrong rating! This movie deserves a lot more than 1 *}"
1,I grew out of this a long long long time ago,This movie is for grown-ups who still enjoy watching cartoons and kung fu movies.I do not.
2,Is a trilogy really required?,"El Mariachi was new, refreshing, quick, and stylistic. Desperado was a little more due to it's available budget. But, Once Upon a Time in Mexico was a disappointment. I am a fan of Rodriguez, but this was something put together quickly for those who pushed him for a sequel, pure and simple..."
2,"Great Plot, Bad Action","For the first 20 minutes of ""Desperado"" I thought I was watching the greatest action movie of all time. Then it all went to hell in handbasket. The ""is it a sequel?"" Sequel ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" unfortunatly resembles the end of ""Desperado"" and not the beginning. Johnny Depp is the only redeeming feature in this movie, and it isn't one of his better performances. There is way too little of Selma Hayek, zero character development, and the action sequences are laughable. The plot, however, is solid, and the only reason I watched this movie to the end. If only the plot could have been matched with what worked at the beginning of the first movie, this could have been great."
3,Once Upon a Time in Mexico...,"Mexico is not a great movie but it is not a horrible one either. The plot isn't that engaging, but is you like watching people get blown to bits(which I do)there is enough gore in this movie to keep you in your seat through the whole thing. I think that without Johnny, it wouldn't be half the movie it is."
3,Hysterical Performance By Johnny Depp!,"The movie itself was nothing to brag about but Johnny Depp's character was absolutely hysterical. I find humor in just about anything so you can't go by me, but even my husband was laughing. I would have to go back to scenes because I'd be like ""I didn't just see that"", ""There's no way that happened"" to find I was correct in my original take. It somehow reminded me of scenes from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. So over the top but hysterical. If you want to see Johnny Depp's humor at its best, watch Pirates of the Caribbean."
3,Good not great!!!,"This film is good, not great. Get me wrong I DID like this film but's just not as good as El Maricahi or Desparado. Johnny Depp is definatly the best thing about this one!!!Antonio Banderas is also good in his reprising role. It's got a great supportin cast(Including Cheech Marin,Mickey Rourke,and Willen Dafoe),but what really disappointed me was that Selma Hayek was in it very too briefly!!! But it's got oodles of action!!! It reminds me a lot the Godfather Trilogy were 1 and 2 are masterpieces and 3 is not!!! It just seemed totally different than the other two!!!But overall an O.K. movie!!! 3 stars for this one!!!"
4,Wait For The End!!,"Once Upon A Time In Mexico is good, but not as strong as Desperado. Our hero, El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) barely has any lines. Throughout the movie we forget this talented actor is the star of the movie. The explosive action is incredible, and including Sands (Johnny Depp) is the only thing worth raving about. Depp's role is actually the best part of this movie. Salma Hayek's role has been chopped to flashbacks, so there is not alot of crazy Action and Romance between Banderas and her. You want Antonio Banderas to save the day and he does, but this Sequel did not give him that fire. Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but does a great job including the rest of the cast (Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe, and Enrique Iglesias). It would have been nice to hear some hot new songs from Enrique Iglesias for the soundtrack but I am more than satisfied with Salma Hayek's ""Siente Mi Amor"". It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire credits!"
1,"Run quick, save yourself.","This movie was such a waste of time. It gets a half star for having semi-decent shootouts and another for a great perfomance by Johnny Depp. Personally though, if you want gunfights you'd do better by renting a John Woo film. By the way whose idea was it to give Enrique a gun. With that said rent at your own risk."
4,Cool,"this movie is pretty good. I like the ending especially,lots of guns and stuff. Johnny Depp is the man, man. Banderras is good too. But yeah, u should buy this"
1,"Guns and Blood , that's it / Sangre y Balazos , eso es todo","I can't believe that, this was the same Director of The Mariachi.This movie really lack of good story. The director just replaced it with some special effects and a lot guns and blood all around. This a good example when a couple of good actors make a bad movie. Boring.No puedo creer que este sea el mismo Director de El Mariachi. Este Film no tiene ni siquiera un buen argumento, el director lo remplazo con balazos y sangre por todos lados. Este es un buen ejemplo cuando un par de buenos actores hacen una pelicula. AAburrida."
3,Desperado was a masterpiece compared to this.,"Dumb sequel that does not have the fun and innocents of the original. Robert Rodriguez seems like he just though this up while he was going along and the movie feels rushed. Despite those problems, the actors do well with what they have and come up with a decent follow up that does not beat the first movie but is decent none the less. The violence is over the top here but the story lacks punch, and fun. The movie cruises alone to it's predicable and watered down end with out a bang and leads of course to another sequel. Kudos to Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast for being good sports but other for that, there is nothing here that matches the leave of intensity that the first film had in spades."
1,This was just too weird for me,"What the heck were they thinking with this talent? It was wasted on a plot that made no sense, had way too much violence, and horror movie goulishness. This movie is crap. I couldn't even finish watching it."
1,WILLIE BLANCO RATES MEXICO MINUS 5 ENCHILADA'S,"""EL MARIACHI"" GOOD TO VERY GOOD PROMISING NEW DIRECTOR- NO LETS CALL HIM FILM MAKER- ROBERT RODRIGUEZ... RODRIGUEZ EITHER HAS VERY LIMITED TALENTS, (THAT WERE TRASPARENTLY EXPOSED IN MEXICO), OR HE HAS BECOME A VICTIM OF THE PATHETIC HOLLYWOOD SYSTEM THAT UNSHAMINGLY CRANKS OUT PRODUCTS THAT PICKS THE POCKET OF AND EXPLOITS THE EXPLOITABLE.( GIMME DOLLA!).BOYS AND GIRLS - THE MOVIE STINKS... SAVE YOUR BUCKOLA'S BUY A HOT FUDGE SUNDAY- YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD..IF YOUR INTERESTED IN A MINDLESS, POORLY SCRIPTED FILM WITH THIRD RATE STUNTS EXPLOSIONS AND SPECIAL EFFECTS, THIS IS FOR YOU. SO POORLY CAST IS FINE ACTOR JOHNNY DEPP ( WHOSE ONE OF MY FAVORITES), THAT IF THIS WAS HIS FIRST FILM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS LAST. ONCE UPON A TIME THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME INTEGRITY AND PRIDE IN FILM MAKING IN HOLLYWOOD BUT IT GOT LOST IN MEXICO, RIGHT ALONG WITH R ROD. DID I MENTION THIS FILM STINKS? WILLIE BLANCO RATES THIS PRODUCT MINUS 5 ENCHILADA'S."
2,It doesn't get any more gratuitous than this...,"If gratuitous violence and gore are in your tastes, you will like this one. Johnny Depp's talent as an actor is obvious but that alone cannot carry this one above the blood-spatter and dismemberment. There are some that like such movies, more power to them. If you are on a low-gore diet, you will want to avoid this one."
1,not enjoyable and super WEAK ! B maybe C movie grade,"How does this movie differ at all from ""Desperado"" (in 1995) besides adding Johnny Depp? The movie is completely unbeliveable and I'm sorry it's also not entertaining in the least. I'm usually a big action movie guy but this one is just a bad bad attempt. This movie didn't make me care anything for the characters nor was I interested in the very loose plot. Thank God it was just a rental and I only wasted ninety nine cents :) Rock On."
3,This is nowhere near the first one !,"2.5 stars indeed ! This is not an ""El Mariachi"" movie, it's rather a ""Johnny Depp"" one. Completely different from the atmosphere of ""Desperado"", it is based on a fancy plot !To sum up, ""El Mariachi"" fans will be dissapointed somewhat !"
4,Songbird Symphony,"I was searching for a replacement for an old CD and found it at Amazon.com. I found a used CD in good condition at a price that was less than the shipping charge. The CD arrived with a shattered case due either to inadequate packaging or inferior shipping and handling. The CD was unharmed so I replaced the case with a spare. I see this a no fault of Amazon and have provided feedback to the seller regarding packaging, shipping and handling. I will definitely use Amazon again."
3,locks,"I used to carry this around to lock up my bike when nothing else was around. If you have a drill, and metal slugs, you can drill holes into cement but that's not very productive on a public sidewalk. If you have about 35 lbs of locks it might work for a while but someone will just throw your bike and locks into the back of a truck.A cheaper idea is to use old weightlifting, cement filled weights and carry those around to lock up your bike. Four big 50 lbs would work if you can manage.Stanley 51-941 16-Ounce AntiVibe Curved Claw Forged Steel Head and Handle HammerRegular 160 Lb. weight Set with Threaded Bar"

4,good deal,"Nice looking product, very sturdy and good for the price. It was bigger than I imagined (guess I didn't look at the dimensions) but that's not necessarily bad. Glad I made the purchase."
1,Avoid this - Impossible install,"I'm a pretty handy guy. I've done plenty of work with concrete lag bolts.I have a good hammer drill, followed all instructions that came with this.This is an impossible install.The lag bolts will either not grab the concrete or will not get inserted because they wont fit.The hole must be precise, I guess.Instructions say to make sure you clean out the concrete dust from the hole you drill.Did that. With a shop vac and a hack saw blade used like a spoon. Still no good. I have three holes and anchor that is not anchored.This is expensive. I don't mind paying for quality. I really hate paying good money for a poor product.Please check my other reviews. I think I panned maybe one product over the years. This one is BAD.Really, really. Don't buy it."
1,"Mostly Plastic, Bolts are RUBBISH!","This Anchor is mostly made of plastic. Under the plastic cover is a small metal plate, which could be cut through in seconds by a thief with an angle grinder. The bolts provided are SUPER LOW QUALITY, and all 3 of my bolts were destroyed before I got anything mounted to the floor. I now need to buy 3 new bolts, 2 new drill bits, and that will cost me as much as the product did in the first place. This is not what it is advertised to be. I have mounted many anchor bolts into concrete, and never before have I had so much trouble with bolts breaking. This is a low quality product, and I would not recommend it to anybody."
1,Are you sure it isn't a comedy? Because I laughed... a lot.,"This movie is just amazing in the fact that it's so stupid and it's not trying to be. Soft-core ""thrillers"" are well known for having virtually no plots or whatever, but this is amazing. If you're not going to have a decent story, at least have some hot women take their clothes off. I mean, it just makes sense. This movie does have women taking their clothes off, yes, but it is remarkably disappointing. If you want to see a movie with a bad plot, and lots of beautiful women, get one directed by Andy Sidaris and DO NOT bother with this... film."
3,Fun to think about the future,"Fun story, but got a little draggy about mid way and I had a hard time staying with it."
3,*Warning!* Doesn't work with Sony PS3 plug,"The ""plug guards"" that are found in the outlets do NOT allow the Sony PS3 pwr cord to be inserted. I ended up having to use my older surge protector to pwr the PS3...bummer."
2,could be better,"They placed this little plastic covers in the plug wholes as a safety thing, i guess so kids don't shove anything in there and get executed.but the thing is so badly designed that you have to put your whole weight on every plug you want to connect, its so hard that i gave up and tried opening the thing and getting rid of the plastic thing all together. but that wasn't possible."
3,"It works, but far from perfect.","This is certainly better than the CyberPower surge protector I had (don't ever buy CyberPower's, they're practically useless), and did eliminate most of the eletrical surges. However, the outlet holes are blocked by poorly designed ""gates"" which makes it difficult to plug thing in."
4,Great item for the price but the plug slide covers stick,On my unit i had to press pretty hard to seat a plug. Its not because its really tight its because there are internal slot covers that do not properly slide out of the way at times. Other than this incovience I love the layout....removed 2 other surge protectors from behind my entertainment system.
3,"good price, good product....BUT","very VERY difficult to insert plugs into the always on outlets....i thought it was broken at first....no way my wife would have been able to insert the plugs, she would have threw this out.....but once in, i guess it doesn't matter (and i guess it is child and adult proof.....good valuegot two in fact, the 8 and 11 outlet versionsif i bought it locally i would have returned it, but after things were hooked it, well you are past the hard part, so i kept it and am happy with it....bottom line, price is right, i would buy again (but they can make a better product)"
3,Works well except for the antenna pass-through,"Arrived on time and in good shape. I really like the way this is configured, leaving lots of room for transformer boxes. Only problem is with the co-ax surge protector pass-through. It attenuates the signal from our DirecTV HD dish antenna so much that we had to connect that lead directly to the TV, so no surge protection if the antenna gets hit."
4,Good item,"Good item, but as other mentioned plugs can be difficult to insert. Also, one of 2 failed within 2 months, but APC exchanged promptly (I did have to pay for shipping back the broken one)"
4,Good Buy,"Handled my 32in LCD HDTV, 7.1 receiver, Sub Woofer, Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, Cable Box, DVD Player, and a USB splitter for the Xbox 360 with no problems.The safety covers that automatically pop up when there is nothing plugged into the socket can make it hard to plug things in sometimes. You have to jiggle the plug until the safety cover moves out of the way. Only reason i gave it 4/5 and not 5/5"
2,Degrades cable TV signal!,"When I passed my cable TV signal through this surge protector, it degraded the signal so much that half the channels became unwatchable. I have been using an older APC surge protector that did not have this problem. Needless to say, I am very disappointed."
5,Still Going Strong,I bought this for my family as a gift due to frequent lightening storms and worry about power spikes. Had for about 2 years and still going strong and so is my TV and computer!
5,Surge Protector,This one was easy for my wife to hook up since it is her computer. The other APC that we had worked well but we did want an upgrade and didn't hesitate with going with the PF11VTC.
5,Classic & Collectible - A must for all fly fishers.,"In ""How to Catch More Trout"", Charlie Meck shared his secrets for catching trout when there's no hatch, under most conditions. In ""The Hatches Made Simple"", he de-mystifies the hatches and explains his system for catching trout during a hatch. Meck's latest effort is a collectible gem published in hardcover with detailed color pictures of some of the most important mayflies and patterns. The book is filled with charts, patterns, and graphs that help simply the identification and matching process. Meck's system helps eliminate the need to carry hundreds of patterns for precise matches, and explains how to successfully ""anticipate"" and ""approximate"" the hatch. Reading ""The Hatches Made Simple"" is a must for the angler who is tired of relying upon luck and wants to take the next step towards expertise. I can't put it down."
5,Eases the method of removing matting of your dog's coat,"I have tried many other tools to remove matted hair from our Bichon Frise, and I have even cut my finger using them.This simple tool allows me to rake across the matted area easily and take the mats away. Constructed of hard plastic and rubber grips, the Matbreaker is compact and comfortable. The blades can be replaced which is a big plus.Even with constant brushing, my dog gets mats around the neck and the junction between the flanks and legs.VERDICTI highly recommend this tool."
2,Matbreaker,"This is probably a great product for short to medium length hair on dogs and (cats), but not on long hair - it pulls to much. I do not recommend it for long hair dogs"
3,adequate,"Maybe it's just that Czech is rather difficult, but I'm struggling getting through this book. I think that the content is great, explanation is good, but I wish there was a workbook to go along with it or more questions throughout the book for practice. I am also regretting that I didn't get the audio portion, as it is quite difficult to imagine how some of the words sound."
4,Very accessible and effective way to learn Czech,"I have already used James Naughton's Colloquial Slovak text, and the Colloquial Czech was equally useful. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to learn the language (but if you have no knowledge of the pronunciation, be sure to find the audio supplements as well, because the text alone may not be enough to give you a complete idea of how to truly speak Czech)."
3,"Er, yes","I have nothing to add to that gorgeous Bernardo's review, apart from I like this sound. Sometimes, like ""bell boyant"", the album reaches really beautiful peaks, but yes, it's as fascinating as fustrating. The melodies are not quite developed, and the thing runs for too long. I love what Bernardo called ""sexless pedophilia"", because yes, there is a bit of an obsession with ""pure"" voices in Takemura's work... but as inpredictable as it gets, I still find it fascinating.Though, and that's a pity, his first album, that amazing mixture of jazz and avant-garde called ""Child's view"", is still the best and most emotionally daring work in his prolific career."
1,A musical lobotomy.,"My sister bought me this album for Christmas last year because she found the cover interesting and assumed that it might be good... WRONG... very wrong. This album is f---ing psychotic. I can imagine somebody going crazy listening to this album repeatedly. Imagine listening to a Japanese children's show on crack. Trust me, I can apreciate experimental music but this album is too bizzare."
1,"Great Tool, impossible maintenance","We have had this for about 5 months now. Other reviews I have read noted that it seemed to be made of ""cheap"" plastic. I haven't noticed any deficiencies there. (we've dropped it a few times). It has many usefull attachments and has been invaluable to myself for minor home repair, and my wife for sculpting stone (which she does alot).It has come time to replace the carbon motor brushes (recomended about every 40 to 50 hours of use) and can't find them anywhere online or in local stores. The XPR takes a new kind of motor brush and no one carries it! We're looking at about 150 hours on it now and the motor is showing signs of needing the brush replaced (inconsistant speed and power) so it sits USELESS until this item becomes available."
3,Love / Hate This Drill,"I have 3 Dremels. 1 cordless and 2 corded including this one. There are only 2 reasons I keep using Dremel.1. The long warrnty.2. It does the job I use it for.This Dremel was sent in for repair shortly after I got it because it wouldn't hold a bit and it just stopped working. The other cordless was sent in TWICE for repair. And the cordless was sent in THREE times for repair, once for catching on fire. However, each time the tools were repaired and returned quickly.The other reason I keep using Dremel is because I have not found another tool that can remove grout as well as the Dremel. Of course, I break a lot of bits in the process. But is does the job.Even though grout removal is not a small job. I've found that the Dremel works best on small crafts and detail work."
2,Never Again,"First off I love tools and have quite a collection, but they have to be reliable. I bought this maybe a few years ago and have used it only a handful of times and I just burned out the second one. The first one stopped working while doing some light routing work on some pine, which is a soft wood. I sent it to the company, who replaced it for free, and just burned out the second one after using it probably two or three times. Most recently it was used to cut off a stripped screw, that's what killed it, a screw. Anyway, I'm very disappointed and would not recommend this tool, or really any other Dremel. I suppose there's always Rotozip."
5,Still kicking,"I've worked this thing pretty hard a few times, perhaps a bit too much for it's size, I don't recommend using it for cutting through tile grout, at least not more than a few inches worth. For all my small hobby cutting/grinding tool needs it works ok."
5,Dremel 400-6/90 Variable Speed XPR Rotary Tool Kit,"Dremel 400-6/90 Variable Speed XPR Rotary Tool Kit With 90 AccessoriesExcellent small tool with many uses, depending upon accessories. Great for model builders, jewelry makers and many other small products including engraving on glass and woodcarving. Amazon was best option for this purchase."
2,It only worked 10 minutes,"Before I actually bought this dremel, I 've done lots of research. people who work in Homedepot also told me that dremel has great reputation, one on his friend owned one for over fifteen years. here comes the problem I realized that dremel has great reputation but I seldom hear people say they own the latest generation dremel which work very well. My own experience is that I turn it on just want to make sure it would run perfectly. the first ten minutes, I am extremely happy and then after a while maybe the eleventh minutes come,it end up starting making noises and stopped running anymore.It was my first time using it and may be the last time. Now I am sending back to Amazon."
2,What happened to the dremel I knew?,"I have gone through 5, count them 5 of this model. 3 failed right out of the box! I had an older Dremel from about 1997 but sadly it was stolen from my shop. The basic design is flawed. The motor and switches get clogged and choked with dust and debris from everything I have tried to cut. The stop button to change the tips locks up. The on/off switch is so difficult to turn on and off I almost cut my hand off. I am saddened to see what has happened to the Dremel. Bosch seems to have taken a once great tool and ruined it. Same as they did for Skil. I am not trying to bash Dremel. I purchased the 3956-02 model and it works fantastic. Its just seems to be the 400-6 model. My recommendation is to skip this model and go for the less expensive Dremel 3956-02 model."
4,a good tool for small jobs or hobbies,"Since I don't own a drill or reciprocating saw, I thought that this tool would replce those. I live in an apartment and need it only for small jobs. For the most part it had worked as a replacement for those. However, I still needed to buy quite a few parts not included in the kit - drill bits, blade for the saw, extra chucks. I realize that I'm not quite utilizing the tool for its intended use, but it has served my purposes. I've been fairly happy the few times I used it. Just note that the tool get very hot with extended use. Overall, this was a good package with the best variety of tool attachments, as for the bits themselves, they could have provided a better selection and slightly better instructions for their use."
1,The Classic Switch-a-Roo!!,"Be very careful! Apparently an Amazon supplier is attempting to pass off a Dremel 3/71+ XPR as a Dremel 400-6/90 Series XPR Kit (by overlaying the actual UPC code with a faux UPC code)but it does not have all of the required parts!!! I am sending the kit I received back in the hopes that Amazon will actually make good on the kit I purchased. If not, I will have to report Amazon to the Better Business Bureau for violation of the UCC rules of representations/warranties!"
1,"Great accessories, but terrible quality on the Dremel","I used the Dremel for a total of about 5 minutes of light-duty cutting, and it began emitting blue smoke. Since I wasn't cutting anything very thick, I figured this was just part of the break-in process for a new tool. I let it cool and went back to cutting, and after another 10 minutes of light use, it emitted huge amounts of smoke, never to run again. The accessories with this pack are great, but pretty useless with a tool that won't last 20 minutes."
2,Not a Serious Tool,"As others have said, this tool may be good for hobby work in pine or balsam, but it's not a serious tool for extended work in denser woods, ceramics, or metals. Mine broke after fairly light use. For those of you looking for a more serious professional rotary tool, I recommend the Proxxon 38481 IB/E Pro model. It's sturdy, has a more powerful motor, & won't be breaking on tougher jobs."
4,Tool is good but Amazon sent me used or refurbished item!,"After the Dremel package arrived, I could not open and use it for some weeks but when I opened it, I realized that the Dremel XPR 400 and Dremel MultiSaw were definitely used and were not new. Amazon sent me a used or refurbished item. Due to time constraint in my project, I have to use it now and cannot return the product to Amazon but definitely, I am extremely dissatisfied with this practice of Amazon.Dremel itself is excellent for small projects, 90 accessories sound huge but many are duplicate copies of same accessory thus you have to buy individual accessories as per your project's unique needs. Dremel is for use in small projects and if you expect to use it as a day-to-day work tool, it will fail your expectations. Noisy at high rpm compared to its small size."
1,Dremel honors warranty on 400 XPR,"I had a 400XPR that was near worthless. After a little run time it became so hot it could not be held, and yes, it smoked on occasion. I sent it back and Dremel replaced with a 4000. What a difference. It is easier to hold, better cooling and it seems like more torque. As a plus there are more accessories for the 4000; The XPR had near none except the standard 1/8"" shank bits and accessories.Gota a bum XPR.....SEND IT BACK! Dremel will make it right!"
1,wrong item shipped,"The Classic Switch-a-Roo!!, January 4, 2006Just as stated on this review i also recieved the dremel 400 xpr 3/71 instead of the 400-6/90. Amazon has done its part by paying for the return shipping and stated they will ship the correct one. The only thing is that its out of stock now and wont ship till feb. The bonus engraver offer expires 1-18-06, so im out of luck. I email amazon and all they said is, if i would like to cancel my order. Would be nice to include an engraver themselves when they ship my correct order but i guess im asking for to much now. And yes i know this is not a review but its better to let people know so they wont get taken by a mistake. Still taking the 129.00 price thou."
5,Dremel 400-6\90,This is a versatile tool that anyone can use.Additional parts may be replaced as they are depleted. They are available from any store or warehouse that sells hardware. I have most full size power tools but there are times when you need a small high speed tool that can get into the hard to get at spaces. This fits the bill.
4,cyclone,"The product I think will be fine, but a number of the attachments were loose in the box. It was difficult to determine if I received all the various accessories. It was shipped quickly and I am stll very happy with the purchases from Amazon."
5,Dremel 400-6/90 Series XPR,This was a great bargain with the 2amp motor and accessories. It is performing great and my 11-yr old daughter and 13-yr old son enjoy it too.
1,So far this is vaporware...,"I've had this item on order since mid-October, and so far there has been no change in the status of this item. Get your act together Amazon!"
1,crap kit,"what can i say? my kit didnt come with any collets,so it cant be used untill i get some. and beware of ""roto tool"" excessorys that arent dremmel, i got a bunch from ebay,different grinders and such,,none fit the hole. so they are useless to me, except maybe in a full size drill ."
4,"For the price, it is missing a few more attachments.","Everyone knows that Dremel makes the best rotary tools and this is not an exception. All the tools are top quality but there is a problem, too few attachments are included."
1,>>>>>: ( <- that's a very angry face,"Bought the tool a couple years ago from home depot. Tried to use it to smooth out some cuts I made on melamine laminated particle board, and the motor burned up after about 15 minutes of use. I didn't even bother sending it back since it was obviously a design flaw that wouldn't be fixed by getting another of the same model. This tool is junk."
1,melted like an ice cream in the Mohave,"Hello, I had great luck with the dremel while doing eeny weeeeny projects. I than needed a tool for a light/medium job. I just had to cut through some sheet metal to cut out small sections. The thing started smoking, smelling, and sputtering to its death. I had to surgically pull out the melted bushings and I than replaced them. It worked again for about 15 minutes, and than its death occured again. This time I am going to bury the eenny wieeny tool for eeny wieeny jobs. If you have to do jobs larger than polishing your little girl's doll, than do not count on this 400 XPR series dremel!"
5,Great tool,"Great tool. Though I actually bought the discontinued 3/70 accessory pack they are almost identical. You could even get a smaller kit and just buy exactly what you need instead. Comes with about every tool tip I could want, except for engraving tips, which would have been nice just to experiment with. It is noisy on high speed, which is used most often, so I will be getting some ear plugs soon for my big job.I've used it to grind another metal tool (wire stripper) so that it would grip more tightly - this worked great! Though you could do almost the same things with a good file set this is much more fun, and quicker.It is recommended let it run on high for 10 minutes before first use to ""lengthen the life"" of the internal components, so maybe that is what some other negative reviewers did wrong."
5,Awesome,Best for kids who are learning to drink from a straw. The straw and cup is so strong. My daughter throws it so many times and it didn't even crack.
5,First Years Straw Disposable Cups,"Love these cups! They can be used over and over and they don't leak (only a teeny bit when my son leaves them lay on their side for a long time...ugh!) I wanted to get my kids off traditional sippy cups due to them impairing language development, and these cups fit the bill!"
2,Concept is good but the cups are not worth it!,"I love the regular take and toss cups, so I was excited when I saw these. I got the boy color four pack for my 2 year old son and at the first usage I realized that these were a bad idea! He can pull the straw out and then the liquid comes out, what is tee point of having a removable straw!? I'm going to try the straw cups with the twisty top instead, don't waste money on these...cheap as they may be!"
1,What's the point?,"These cups are useless. If your toddler needs a straw cup to prevent messy drinking, he or she is likely to throw it to the ground, at which time the lid pops off and beverage goes all over the floor, or turn it upside down, so the beverage spills all over your kid, or just take the lid off, which is easy to do, and -- you guessed it -- the beverage spills everywhere. Even for just drinking water, these are useless. I'm going to buy more of the Playtex Twist and Click straw cups. Those lids stay on, and they have some mechanism in the straw to prevent all the liquid from pouring out if the cup is turned upside down."
4,almost perfect,"Until it gets knocked over or turns upside down. Lol only cups my son will drink out of for his milk. Straw is hard, no valve so it is fast flowing and not leak/spill proof. I have yet to experience it being thrown or dropped so I don't know how durable but for the price, not a big deal."
1,Not as shown!!!,"I received red, white, and blue sippers instead of the ones that are shown. I also bought bowls and plates in the pictured colors. I was disappointed needless to say!"
2,Pretty lame..,"I guess if first you can't succeed, just keep repeating yourself until hopefully somebody catches on. I bought this CD because I heard the band had ""grew"" musically. Not so. With the exception of a couple of alright Sugar Ray knock-offs, its the same ole song and dance for the boys, except the older they get, the sillier it sounds.Too bad.."
4,A wonderful discovery for me.,"A shame that amazon doesn't have samples linked here, but if you want to hear before buying (as I did), go to Mike Therieau's website. I was convinced by the song ""Wear You Off My Mind."" In fact, on that one track only both song and singer sounded so much like Joe South, whose music I treasure, that I had to look really hard at this guy's picture. The cd is a little uneven in places, hence 4 stars (can somebody please throttle back on the lady singing the backing vocals on ""Wear You Off My Mind"" -- an otherwise terrific number), but some of the songs aren't just pretty good, they're majorly impressive: ""Creeping Around,"" ""I Stole a Heart,"" the title track, and ""Devil Make My Bed"" remind me of the good old days when soul met country and rock, and life was good and music was even better. And yet, these songs are fresh, this guy isn't just imitating the old stuff. This cd is well worth the money, and I'm looking forward to what this guy comes up with next."
5,Works great,"We've owned two of these for about a year, and they both work perfectly. One is in a small utility room and contends with the cat's litter box. The room is definitely much fresher using this unit. We keep the other in the living room and don't notice much difference one way or the other. These are low-capacity units, not meant for large rooms. They cover both outlets of a two-outlet plug, so beware of this. And, as others have noted, the nightlight can't be turned off separately. This doesn't bother us since we put the units where we had nighlights previously. Overall, great value for the money."
3,MOSTLY BAD QUALITY,"It's hard for me to recommend this set because all but two of these DVDs have very bad transfers. All but two are pan and scan. That being said, I believe Geneon [Pioneer] is the only one releasing these titles so if you have a favorite at least the price is low. Two of the titles are really exellent movies with bad transfers. A Town Called Hell and Have a Nice Funeral really deserve better.Pancho Villa-good story/great image quality(letterboxed).Bad Man's River-average story/good image quality(letterboxed).Captain Apache-average story/poor image quality.Five Savage Men-good story/poor image quality.A Town Called Hell-great story/poor image quality.Have a Nice Funeral-great story/poor image quality."
2,Difficult to follow,"As a new Flash MX user, but an experienced programmer and graphic designer, I found this book difficult to follow. There is a lot of Flash terminology that is used by never explained. Also, the authors jump into small details of Flash capabilities without providing an overview of them first. For example, the Movie Clip is described as the most important and commonly used type of object in Flash. But the authors never tell you what a movie clip is, what its basic features are, the variety of ways in which they can be used, and how they related to other objects in Flash. They immediately jump into the details of the movie clip class methods. Unless you already have an intermediate level of Flash experience, this book leaves you saying ""What are they talking about?"" a lot."
2,"Great Overview Book, Not the best to learn","This book does cover a lot of material for Flash MX. By reading through this book, you will see what Flash can do, but not really know how to do it. There were many times I would look up XXXXX and the book will say""Flash MX can also do XXXXX, this really helps.""But it is VERY brief on how to do it. So 5 if you just want to see what Flash can do or have experience with it and need to refresh your mind. 1 if you don't know anything about Flash and using it to learn."
1,Hammer of Boredom,"In the end notes Clarke comments that the original idea for this novel was a short story...unfortunately he then went and fleshed it out to a book. Bottom line, if you like fluffy SciFi with sketchy characters and a straight forward, basic plot this is an undemanding (if somewhat frustrating because of the short chapters) read.If you've read Clarke at his best, this is totally disapointing.If you have a teenager who is leaning toward SciFi, try them on this...I think that's about the right age group."
2,Will Earth be destroyed? Who cares?,"Not a bad idea, but poorly executed.This books is incredibly dry - full of scientific facts and future history that reads exactly like a history text book. We are only introduced to one character, and even then we only get brief vingettes of his life that do little to get us involved. In the end I just couldn't care if he lived or died or if the Earth was destroyed. Who cares?Don't waste your time."
2,Hammered,"The plot has been overdone. The setting, characters, and mood are poorly developed. Arthur C. Clarke is unquestionably one of the best three or four authors in the science fiction genre, however, this book would not make the top 100 list of science fiction novels. I wish to take nothing away from Clarke's reputation, except that I don't think he was really trying when he wrote this uninspiring piece. As another reviewer has suggested, the lunar olympics was the best portion of the novel and it did not develop anything else in the book."
3,Clarke doesn't make use of the potential this book has,"The Hammer of God has tremendous potential for an emotional, dramatic, and exciting story: an asteroid big enough to end civilization hurtles towards the Earth, humanity's only hope is a ship sent to divert the asteroid. However, Arthur C. Clarke does not take advantage of this potential because he does not develop the characters at all. As a result, this book is dry and uninteresting."
5,A Change of Pace,"I loved this book! Clarke takes a different approach in Hammer of God, switching from technological forecasting to sociological brainstorming, and hits one out of the ballpark. His predictions are hilarious; Christianity and Islam merge into a single religion! On the surface his ideas seem absurd, but a quick glance at the front page of your daily newspaper suggests that Clarke's ideas might be closer to reality than one would like to think.The only thing about Hammer of God I didn't like was that it was too short! I know Earth will be saved, but Clarke creates such an interesting social panorama that I want to know more."
3,"Not Much to the Book, but Fun","The Hammer of God is a fast book, and there isn't much to say about it except that. I read this book in less than three hours, and thoroughly enjoyed Clarke's very short chapters and interesting tangents on the book's world. Most of it had very little meaning to the actual plot, consisting of rather shallow and typical characters, but its fun. I found it more interesting to read the details of this futuristic world and its lifestyle rather than the asteroid-hitting-Earth part of the book.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants to read science-fiction unless they are interested in what Clarke has to say about a possible future world of ours."
3,Should have known better.,"I think I don't give the book as much credit as it possibly deserves because of the overload of Earth-In-Path-Of-Asteroid stories that have been abundant the past decade or so. Maybe if I read this before seeing Armageddon I'd have liked it more, but I agree with another reviewer - it just seemed very dry, which could be because the asteroid plot isn't new and exciting to me, and the characters can't carry the story on their own."
2,Fed up half way through...,"Might've been a good book, but by the time a book has reached the half way point it should have long since finished preparing you for what you need to know to understand what is going on. By the half way point Clarke still hadn't finished with relaying the informtion we needed to know to understand the rest of the story, and I said enough is enough. This is a good book for someone who isn't as picky about getting down to it. I don't mind getting the background I need to understand what's going on, but by the time the book is half way finished the preparation should have been long since done with. I'm done with this one...I like Arthur C. Clarke, but I'm not particularly fond of this book. -kd5-"
3,"Not great, not bad.","This book is more about the future society in which this story takes place and less about the plot (stopping an asteroid from slamming into earth). I'm not a big fan of books solely about future societies, so I wasn't terribly enthralled about this one."
3,This is suprisingly good....,"I just accidentally got this record. I put it on and it sounded good. It's an English band that has been hanging out in Los Angeles for a while. They are a little like AC/DC and a little like Supergrass. We get all this on the first track ""Gimme Some Lip."" The first few songs have some hot guitar licks that are memorable. This band is not to be confused with Nic Armstrong and the Thieves. This is hard rock music with melodies. All the songs are remarkable. There is some intense jamming. Apparently this band was sort of a Mars Volta type band five years ago. Now they are all about appealing songs. The Thieves are something to check out."
4,Tales From The White Line - must have record!,"So I picked up Tales From The White Line two days ago and I can't stop listening to it. I especially love Just A Piece, My Old Mind and This Road (It Never Leads Us). Not to mention the awesome ""break down"" in the middle of Oh No. Wonder how that transcends live?!I definitely recommend this record to anyone whose a fan of proper rock n roll. Or even those who are a fan of the Jet record. ROCK N ROLL!"
3,Well...,"If the target audience is inner-city black children who have unwittingly picked up Southern California surfer lingo, then this book succeeds on all accounts. That most likely NOT being the case, however, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when faced with this work.The heart is in the right place, but either the language needs some updating, or we need to change the title to The Gospel According to Jeff Spicoli.Three stars for an honest effort. Keep up the the ministering."
3,Not what I expected,This book will sit around until someone comes along and likes it. I offered it to several young people but they didn't care for it.
3,"Wrong, but funny.","While it might be ridiculous, it's really funny. It's not a substitute for the Bible, and I wouldn't really recommend it for anything other than a laugh."
4,By any means necessary,"I can appreciate and I am thankful for additional forms of expressing the message. Someone has to do it and like it or not, we live in a society in which this book could be a useful tool. Not to be confused with our ""sacred scriptures"", but can be used as an additional method. I have utilized the Black Bible Chronicles many times, and I was anxious to see this author's next work. Anyway, I recommend it. It is very easy reading and I appreciate the author's desire to bring more clarity to people who need it. By the way, who says only black kids communicate this way?"
1,Blasphemous for the sake of a laugh,"I only purchased this book for educational reasons. I was even more disgusted than I was when I was informed of its existence. The verbiage used is intended to interest the ""inner city culture"" in reading the bible, but the language is so distasteful & the meaning behind most verses are lost in it. I almost hoped this would be a bible to give to the youth, but this shouldn't be considered a bible in any form."
3,Duke was at his best! What Happened? ~~~~~~,"This movie had great Character Actors. However, when the plane just landed smooth and hardly any damage; this was pretty disappointing. This did not look like the Antarctic. The best part of the film were all the actors. I really expected to see igloos and no trees.Any, still a pretty good movie."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a big John Wayne fan, and was eagerly awaiting the release of this seldom seen film. Sorry to say, I was very disappointed. John Wayne actually gives one of his finest performances in the service of a corny and poorly made film. The distraction of all the mistakes helped to ruin the film for me. There are so many, but for example: The search pilots can hardly see out of their windows because of all the ice, yet when the planes are shown from outside, there is no ice to be seen anywhere. Another? During a blizzard, the wind is howling and the snow is blasting down around them, but the limbs on the trees behind them are not even moving. There are so many others, I could make a list.The use of third party voice-over narration was corny even by 1950's standards. It was usually relegated to educational films shown in the public schools.This one was hardly worth the wait."
5,"If you like John Wayne AND DC-3's, this movie is for you","The story line, Air Transport Command Pilots ferrying and otherwise flying aircraft to and from areas of warfare during WWII, was good and well acted. Icing conditions aloft in far north America force down John Wayne and crew, and the tale of survival and rescue is captivating. The movie is full of people you'd not expect--""Alfalpha"" as a young adult copilot, and Andy Devine as a Captain, for example. The DC-3 flying shots (and there is no other kind of aircraft in this movie) are nothing short of fantastic. John Wayne did a great job in the lead role too."
4,Good movie,Bought this movie for my husband for Christmas and he really loves it alot.He is a big John Wayne fan.
2,"Is this supposed to be ""tense""?","Let's look away from the slap stick. It is corny today, but perhaps it was OK in the fifties.But how can you make tension out of a bunch of guys lolling around in a nice spring snow of between plus two or minus four Centigrades?And I believe I had a harder landing in a 737 last year."
4,Island in the Sky,"The only drawback from total 5 stars for this old DUKE classic is I wish someone would have ""colorized"" it by now. It brought back fond memories of a simpler time when we actually HAD TO CARE for each other."
1,Island in the Sky,"I am John Fayne fan on age, saw these movie already once long long ago and it is still good movie."
5,"I guess we're hard to see down here, harder than we thought...","Before ""Flight Of The Phoenix"" (the Jimmy Stewart version, not the lame remake) this was the ultimate airplane crash-survivor story ever made. Held close to the Ernest K. Gann novel, but lacking in some detail, it tells a tight story of an aircrew down in uncharted territory in the early 50's. John ""The Duke"" Wayne renders a subdued and strong performance as the leader of the downed fliers. Other icons of the period; Andy Devine, Lloyd Nolan, James Arness (otherwise known at the time as ""The Thing"") play strong supporting roles. It's a race against time to find thier lost buds before they freeze to death and the urgency is conveyed wonderfully. One of The Duke's better movies. Yes, Stutz's co-pilot is Alfalfa."
3,Textbook professionalism,"As filmmaking, William Wellman's long unseen Island in the Sky is textbook professionalism about textbook professionals - in this case John Wayne's pilot and his crew downed in uncharted Labrador and the various pilots trying to locate them before a storm finishes them off. There are no surprises (aside from the horrific sight of Andy Devine in swim trunks!), there's an excess of narration at times (much of it delivered by Wellman himself), and it doesn't stand up to the best of Wellman's aviation pictures, but it's good, solid entertainment, convincingly staged and boasting a superb Tiomkinesque score by Emil Newman.The extras package on Paramount's DVD is pretty impressive as well, boasting a good selection of featurettes, an interesting audio commentary from the director's son and supporting cast members, stills gallery, newsreel footage and even John Wayne's introduction to co-star James Arness' Gunsmoke TV series."
4,"I thought I had seen all Duke Movies, not this one.","I do not think I have ever seen a Duke movie I would not watch again. This might not be his best, but it was a good one. I am also a veteran, and I had to laugh at some of the heavy handed stereotypes. If you are a quartermaster that believes going beyond 110%, then I apologize for all of the people I found that fit the stereotypical character presented in this movie.Other then the Henry the Eighth fat butt, and Marshal Dillion over doing his character, everyone else did a great job. Duke even over did some of his seasons but, all and all it was a great job."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas and it only worked correctly one time. Eforcity refuses to replace it now, because they only have a 30-day return policy, and their customer service was awful."
5,historical context of the Talmud,"This book describes the premedieval Babylonian society in whichthe Talmud evolved, and how this little corner of the Middle Eastbecame a center for Jewish learning. I was surprised to learn thatthere is some downright weird stuff in the odd little corners of theTalmud, legends about rabbis having magical powers and so forth."
3,This was a gift,I bought this for my son. I didnt' read it myself so I can't give it a fair rating other than ok. He liked it though.
3,who can take that much dope and live!!!!,"I have read about Phineas Poe and his wild, drug and alcohol induced sex romps, nonstop supply of blood on his clothes and not showering for days and still getting laid for three books now. I have to say, like the previous two books, Hells Half Acre was hard to put down- probably more so than judas and penny- but i am sooooo glad this trilogy is done. i dont think Poe could stand anymore!! Strong finish in the series, highly recommend for all you sickos out there to read them all."
4,Fantastic read,"I struggled at times with Baer's first novel. It was weird. I like weird, but it seemed to stumble sometimes. This one clicked like the divine. Baer takes his character from the first and throws him basically into a whole new world. The underground subculture Baer creates has to be one of the most original things I've read in a long time.I'd give it 5, but you could tell the the author held back, that he really could have exploded the book into something huge but felt constrained to make it fit into the noir crime fiction genre when it is obvious that it really transended it."
3,A fractal depiction of nothing,"Kiss Me, Judas was strangely compelling...odd, off-beat, uniquely different. The writing deftly conveyed the main character's dissociation, which helps explain his irrational behavior and pathological acceptance of the psychopaths around him. In Hell's Half Acre, the same approach continues, but it begins to wear thin. Will Phineas ever do anything rational, will he ever do anything interesting, will he ever stop descending into a meaningless, random walk of a pathetic loser in a psychotropic narrative? Unfortunately it appears not."
5,"Excellent musicianship, fun and playfull","OMG, this is wonderful music. Jackie Byard's piano solos are worth the price in gold. He includes so many nuances, tidbits of memories, and incorporates the whole Americana. Mr. Mingus's bass is thumping and pushing the musicians far beyond what I have heard in the past. How about Jonny Coles? What can I say, his tone is clear and he puts in 110%. Eric Dolphy's solos are great, and even Danny Richmond gets some too! All this, plus it swings! This is 5 star all the way! A welcome addition to my collection."
5,"I Was There,and What Memories It Brings Back","I traveled by bus to Cornell from my college in Binghamton NY to attend this concert. I had been blown away by Mingus' records since 1961, and wouldn't have missed it for the world. I was the jazz disc jockey for my small college radio station. It is one of my most indelible memories of years of listening to jazz. I can't improve on the positive comments of the other reviewers of this CD, except to say AMEN. This is not the greatest Mingus recording. There are a dozen that equal it, but you cannot go wrong by getting this CD. One ""Mingus story"" I want to share is that half way through the concert, Mingus started to pound the pointed leg of his bass hard into the stage, saying the stage surface was slippery and his bass was slipping. I don't know if this tactic worked, but I'm sure the marks were in the stage for quite some time. In my opinion, I find this music superior to any of the recordings made by this group in Europe a month later."
4,A scholarly treatment of world religions.,"The treatment of each tradition varies depending on the perspective of the various authors. Some emphasize structure, others ideology, and yet others the historical story. This reader appreciates the detail provided but finds it difficult to relate one tradition with the other. Graphs and charts are helpful but are not consistent between various traditions. This volumn is for the student of religions who has a background and intends to continue the study."
2,Only a mini-book,"I am a huge fan of Dr Sears and practice attachment parenting and so purchsed this to help with our sleep issues. Sadly, this is a very tiny book that contains the Q & As from his website and other books. Nothing new and no answers. We ALREADY co-sleep, we ALREADY use a sling. We ALREADY respond to our baby's every cry. BUT we are STILL getting up with her every 2 hours and she's a year old. We NEED some sleep. I found a different book that Dr Sears wrote the introduction to called The No-Cry Sleep Solution and it actually has the answers. At 250 pages it has got tons of practical ideas that really are helping my baby to sleep better. I knew Dr Sears would lead me to the answers, but he didn't do it with this mini-book."
1,A short booklet,This booklet is only a few ideas taken from other Sears books. I was desperate for sleep and needed help but this didn't do it. I finally found the book that Sears recommends called No Cry Sleep Solution which is compatible with all Sear's teaching and has great solutions.
1,This books goes against everything I know,"I'm a new mom and I wanted to start out on the right foot with my son's sleeping habits. After flipping through the pages of this book all it talks about is 'sleep sharing'. Well, I don't want to 'teach' my child to sleep with us, I wanted to help my child sleep in his own bed. This book was very big on bed sharing. The book stated that you needed to be a good parent and practice parenting even during the night. The book was full of questions that parents had asked about getting their toddler to sleep in their own bed, well after Dr. Sears told the parent to let the child sleep in the parents bed when they were an infant, Dr. Sears told the parents to put a bed or futon in the parents room and develop a 'special sleeping area'. I've never heard anything so crazy in my life. I don't support anything this book had to say. I strongly feel that you need to develop sleeping habits when the child is in his/her own room in their own bed or crib."
4,Utne Reader of the Underground,"The Zine Yearbook, Vol. 6 samples from zines published in 2001 that had a circulation of less than 5,000 copies. Arranged alphabetically, the article and comic excerpts preserve the original layout. As such, each sample is a microcosm of the originating zine. The varied compendium starts suitably with an analysis of the current state of zines from Ache (more ""metacommentary in graphic form from Cat and Girl) and thus begins a swatch the runs the gamut from personal rants (America? and Etidorhpa) to the activist agenda (Media Reader and Resist). While, statistically, most 2001 zines of small distribution were probably poetry and music publications, The Zine Yearbook continues the worthy task of presenting a spectrum of guerilla social criticism and the wit that arises from punk ideology."
5,Great idea generater!!!,I first stumbled across this book while helping a fourth grade teacher where my daughter attends school. He was using the pictures as writing prompts for his class. I must say that I was entranced. The pictures are fabulous and do indeed grab your attention and demand that you imagine the story within the picture. A must for every teacher and parent who wants to encourage creativity!
5,A great mystery!,Educators will love using this portfolio with effective imagery to help students create ideas for writing. My own children enjoyed writing about what they thought happened to Harris Burdick.
5,Excellent resource for teachers,"I'm a student teacher, and i'm really excited about using this book in the future with children that I will teach.The illustrations are really thought provoking and gorgeous.The illustrations are large and clear and are presented nicely in the packaging.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody that teaches or to any parents. :)"
5,The BEST,"For accelerating the imagination of a child, this book works like a magic potion. I am 18 now, and love it as much as I did the first time I read it, at about age 7. Its drawings are magical, and I think the real draw in VanAllsburg's work is that it's a little eerie, too. There are mysteries here (hence the title), and my favorite thing about these fragments is that they are presented as just that-- fragments of a story. They make for excellent creative exercises for children, making up the stories around the pictures and bits of narrative. If you are a parent looking for books for your children, BUY THIS. And even if you are looking for books for yourself, take a look. Relive the magic of your childhood, because this book is begging you to."
5,Remembered fondly from childhood,"I am 21 years old and could not be more excited to find this book again! My uncle read to me and my cousins all the time when we were children. This book along with The Polar Express, The Wreck of the Zephyr, and Jumanji became one of our favorites! I had no idea until now that they were all the same author. The Mysteries of Harris Burdick was especially fascinating. Because only pictures with captions are provided we gazed at this book for hours, imagining all the possibilities. I strongly urge parents to buy this book and others by Van Allsburg. I feel that they all encourage reading, and this book in particular encourages the imagination. Though I haven't seen or read his books in years, I still remember them as if I read them yesterday."
5,What a way to get adolescents writing and thinking!,"As an English teacher I am always looking for new and exciting ways to inspire creativity in my students. Van Allsburg's book has been one of the best writing prompts I have ever used. The unusual, thought provoking, black and white sketches along with their mysterious quotations inspire writers of all ages...even the principal who was a former shop teacher!The best part of the book is the ""mysterious"" letter on the opening page that explains the existence...and the mystery of the pictures. I usually read the letter to my class, flash the pictures from the front of the room, and then create a writing station during other small group activities. The book is always very popular with my eighth graders. Ten copies of the book would be too few"
4,Great book and price!,"I paid very little for this great book because it was used. After getting it, I simply recovered the front with clear wrapping and it practically looks like new! I love using the book in my classroom and the kids LOVE trying to complete the stories. Thank you!"
5,Visually amazing.,"This book will get ANYONE writing. Great for kids, but probably better for adults who've forgetten how to use their imaginiations."
5,A great book and mystery for all ages,This book has pictures that were supposedly drawn by an artist who dissapeared before he could turn in the story. An intriguing mystery it captivates younger children and parents. The pictures are surreal and the pictures leave you hanging.
5,The art of the understatement used to it&#65533;s full potential,"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick has the ability to capture a child's or an adult's imagination. The pictures were beautifully done, and the captions are just enough to inspire, but not take control of the story. I think that Chris van Allsburg was the greatest children's author of the twentieth century."
5,Children's book?,"Maybe. But it is a wonderful book for everyone. It stirs the imagination into action! If every adult were to own one children's book, this one should be it..."
1,Disappointed,"Although beautifully illustrated (in an eerie way) I found this book totally inappropriate for a young reader. Imaginative, yes; scary, yes. Not for reading at all, but for creating beyond the seed thoughts and weird accompanying illustrations."
2,Incomplete set,"The pictures are wonderful, but the set I received was short one print. I laminated each sheet and noticed the missing sheet in this process. Contacted the company twice to ask about ordering a replacement sheet, but have never received a reply. The prints are beautiful, but pray that you don't help from the company!"
3,The fumes are noxious!,"I used this temporary caulk on my drafty aluminum windows. It goes on smoothly, and any that you get on your hands is easily washed off. It seems to do a pretty good job keeping out the bulk of the drafts. It doesn't smell bad when you are applying it, however, the next 48 hours are terrible. The fumes are overpowering and obnoxious. Initially it stuck well to the aluminum window frames, however, as time passed it seemed to be coming off the windows. None of it has fallen off, but it seems to have come up in some places. I have not removed it yet so I cannot comment on removal yet.04/01/09 Update: I just started removing the caulking from the window and it comes up easily and leaves no residue.All in all... Apply it in sessions over a few weeks and make sure there is plenty of ventilation."
1,DAP 18324 10.1 oz Seal 'N Peel Caulk,"DAP 18324 10.1 oz Seal 'N Peel CaulkAfter following the instructions on the tube, it didn't adhere to the window frame."
5,Removable Caulk,This product works great. It stinks for a few hours but I burnt a candle to help with the smell. No more drafts coming in our wood windows for the winter.
4,Seems to be a good product,"The main reason I'm using this on my windows is because of tiny bugs coming in, but extra insulation couldn't hurt either. When I first started applying it I didn't think the smell was so bad. Smelled like model glue, or maybe rubber cement. About an hour into it the smell became more intense and I had to leave the room and close the door. That was 24 hours ago and I'm back in the room. I can barely smell it now. I probably put it on too thick but I did have some big crevices to fill on these old windows. It's clear and hard to the touch. I think it'll be suitable for my needs."
4,DAP Seal N Peal Caulk,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase the DAP Seal N Peal caulk. I installed it on all of my windows, and because I have a 1 month old and 2 year old, we stayed at my parents house for the next day. There is an obvious odor after install, and I was did get a headache towards the end, which may or may not have been related. The bottom line, is that I am very satisfied with this product! I'm sure it will make a difference on my heating and cooling bill. Just don't hang around for 1-2 days after you install."
1,BULL...,This product sucks. I ordered 2 and couldn't even get the first one to act right. I stored this in the garage with the other random stuff. I guess that is why I couldn't find it in any hardware stores. Save your sanity - don't buy it.
4,Does what it says!,"Works very well for sealing drafts (certainly better than rope caulk, and much less messy). However, it gives off a lot of organic vapors so make sure to use this in a WELL ventilated room with proper respirator and eye protection in order to be safe.Peels away very well when not needed. Save money on those drafty windows!"
1,Toxic odor is so bad it negates usefulness of product,"I used 1-1/2 tubes of this caulk in my basement and it made my entire 2 story house smell so terrible that I had to evacuate my family. I have used other weatherproofing products over the years and I have never encountered one with such a toxic byproduct. I thought for a bit I was going to have to take my family to the hospital. I had the basement exterior door open during installation, but obviously had to close it once night came. People who buy this are going to use it when it is cold outside. Not when it is 60 out and we can sleep with all the windows open in the house. The ability to open the windows totally negates the use of this product.There are many other solutions that are safer for your families health and are just as effective. I would recommend avoiding this product at all costs. I will never use it again or recommend it to friends or family whose health I cared about."
2,"Seals great, but fumes are horrible","The only reason I did not give this product a 1 star is because the product does actually seal windows wonderfully, but the fumes are horrible. Even 12 hours after application fumes are still present. Any savings by sealing your windows will be lost by the amount of time your unsealed doors/windows need to be open to let out the fumes. If you think about it the product's instructions present a perfect oxy moron. You need to apply in a well ventilated area yet you are sealing the very windows that would allow for ventilation. It seems that the manufacturer could have developed the product a little further to eliminate the fumes and thus the need to open up your whole house for hours to get rid of them. I recommend using another product or method to seal your windows."
1,Holy total piece of CRAP!!!!,"I hope that Bon Jovi sues the bling of this total imposter! OMG it sounds like this was done on a home computer and is not even a piece of crap, it's worse than CRAP! He's ruined some of the best songs out there and uses backing tracks that would not even qualify for karaoke! OMG I can't even write anymore it's making me so pissed off that this type of horrible crap would be allowed to be released!"
2,The 4 Corners Disappoints,"Disappointed in the effort. Didn't know whether I was reading a management theory book or ""Pastoral Theory For Carolina Basketball Fanatics"", Dean was almost to good to be a real person and Chadwick mixed too much of his pastorial experiences into the book so that you couldn't translate it to ""us"" in our work environments. As a Dean fan for over 40 years, a true role model, I just had a hard time trying to get to the last page. Very disappointing for the most part, even though I practice some of his principals even without reading the book, I really didn't find as much insight as I had expected. Mr. Chadwick needs to stick to the pulpit and not give up his Sunday job just yet!"
3,"He is the greatest coach of all time, but...","This book definitely deifies Dean Smith. The fact that it's written by a preacher may have something to do with that. It's a fine book, it's just that you get the feeling that you can't really take anything in it seriously because the book is so obviously biased. The writing is not the best, but the stories are touching and definitely showcase Smith's leadership talents."
1,Let Down,"The product description says that this suribachi includes the wooden pestle. I was only sent the bowl. I have looked around for one I can use but wooden ones are difficult to find, even in this culturally diverse city I live in. I feel it was false advertising or an inexcusable oversight. Bad business. The bowl is beautiful and I would love to be able to use it, so it is a big let down that I cannot."
2,Description is a lie!,"We purchased this table for 1/3 this price at Sears. It is advertised as a 7 foot table but that is a lie. The playing area does not even measure 6 feet, much less 7. The description even gives the measurements, so how can they call this a 7 foot table. To call it that, it should measure a 7 foot playing area. It was fine for what we wanted it for and the price was great but they should advertise it as it really is."
5,Worth It!!,All of Davies Babies products are amazing. I have been using them for 5yrs now and I always give there bubble bath and foam wash as shower gifts. The scent lasts a very long time on your little one and even hides that annoying spit up smell. I love this stuff!!
3,Handle came off,"After a year of very light use, the handle has come off. it looks like it's welded on by three small points on each end of the handle. not sure how I can fix this now. otherwise it was a nice cup, terrible saucer."
4,Great Jacket,Ive had it about 2 years and it still looks new. The insulate surprisingly maintains you warm on very cold days. Very stylish jacket at a great price
4,great coat for the snow.,i bought this coat for my brother. he says that h needed something for the wyoming snow . he said this was perfect.
3,A simpathic biography of a great champion,"Well, what can I say about ""Ayrton Senna : The Hard Edge of Genius""? The book itself is not atractive, but is nice. Has very good pictures about the carrer of Ayrton Senna and good appointments of the author. But, in the really, it is just a big almanac. Hilton can't express the spirit of Senna. Just explains some moments of important races, like Suzuka-88. But, reading the book, we don't know that Senna 'saw God at the last curve' - his own words. So, if you are a fan of Senna, buy the book to remember the big champ."
4,Reframing Evangelical Practice?,"Mark Strom has written a critique of much current evangelical practice. He outlines the world Paul operated in, a world where elitism and abstraction ruled, he then shows how the apostle Paul challenged this world. His critique is that, ironically, much contemporary evangelical practice more closely resembles the world Paul was challenging than Paul himself. A challenge worth sitting up and listening to."
4,Playing Church,"A helpful book which has emphasised for me how often we are really ""playing church"" instead of ""being church"". It has also been helpful in trying to sort out issues of pragmatic concern as oppossed to issues of the fundamental nature of church. For status quotarians, it is a scary proposition that is raised by Mark, but then we are not called to the staus quo but to real life in Christ expressed in openess and ""grace-full conversations"". A real challenge for us in our western society who like the anonymity of individualism.A simplified format (study guide????) would be useful for those to whom the current format is daunting or inaccessable."
1,Worked for a minute then stopped!,"We got the humidifer and tried it in the car w/ the car adapter and it wouldn't work, then we used it in the house w/ the regular plug and it worked so we used a converter in the car to use the regular plug and it worked for about 1/2-1hour and then stopped! Very frustrating! I returned it!"
1,Total Dud,"This product did not work at all. Set it up, plugged it in, and nothing. Currently waiting for a replacement."
3,"Does job, but is not quiet","I generally like this product. It does what it says it will do, which is to generate mist. It is not noisy, but it is not quiet either, as is claimed. It emits a high-pitched whine which my co-workers in adjacent cubes can hear, though they say they can tune it out. I probably will not use it at work, since I don't want to irritate anybody."
2,not good for room,I live in a 10'*10' room which is quite small. But this humidifier has no effect on making the air of my room wet but it did make the table which I placed it very wet! And I filled it with purified water but it ran out of water in 2 hours! Maybe suitable for car I think.
2,Works great at first... but then...,"I bought this for work to use on my desk (which essentially it's made for). The first day it worked great, but then by the second day it stopped working. I did what it said and cleaned out the container, changed the filter and adjusted the filter casing and it would work again for about 10 minutes. It's cheaply made and not a good buy. ;-("
1,Unreliable product,"I bought this product to serve as a humidifier for our mini-van especially when the family is on long trips. It came with a car adapter and base so thats a plus. Unfortunately when I used it, it ran for a few minutes and then just stopped working. It wont work when plugged in via the AC adapter as well. This product is unreliable."
3,I found the plot more interesting than the main characters,"I found this book to be a bit better than a lot of the books which pigeon-hole themselves into the ""gay fiction"" genre. One of the other reviewers for this book noted the weakness of the main characters. I totally agree. I was not inspired or engaged in any way by the main character or his lover. That was rather odd considering that I did quite like some of the more minor characters (especially Daphne). One of my main complaints about mysteries is that so very often the plot unfolds by clues and leads simply jumping into the characters' laps. A Simple Suburban Murder is no exception, although I've read books which have been much more unrealistic. I found the plot interesting enough to pull me through the book but the over-the-top political correctness put me off. I liked the ending ok but at this point it's a total toss-up as to whether I will ever read another book by this author or in this series."
2,An often embarrassing attempt at the mystery genre,"This book is hampered by stilted dialogue, one dimensional characterization, lack of humor, and a cloying adherence to political correctness. One longs for Donald Strachey's wit or Henry Rios's empathetic angst, something that would these characters more believable and identifiable. As it is, they're deadly dull. On top of that, the writing reminds one of a creative writing class reject in need of proofreading (early on, for instance, ""homicide"" is spelled ""homocide"" - an unintentional glitch or some copy editor's idea of a joke?) Stick with Nava, Hansen, and Stevenson."
4,Beautiful American word pictures painted by Kuralt,"Kuralt is an American treasure. His essays, word pictures ofAmerica, take on a special quality when heard on tape. All of his essays are his legacy--to remind us of the amazing nature of American society and of the need for a new crop of American writers to find the hidden jewels of Americana."
3,Good Grief,The editing for 90 seconds of television was too severe for the treasured scenes to work as effectively in book form. Am I just still too sad at our loss to fill in the gaps? Though disappointed I read on and on. No doubt you will too. Kuralt was a quintessential American treasure himself.
4,This doll looks amazing,"It looks great. I don't use it, I bought it to give to my niece and she absolutely loves it. I wish she had more of investors mind to not take it out the package, but hey she's nine and she enjoys it. That's all that matters."
2,Thank God for Music Sampler,I think the title just about says it all. Unless you're searching for some dusty old hard to find time waster.......I am highly disappointed that Van Morrison would even have his name associated with it. Oh well!
5,Lots of Detail-No Legalese,I thought it was a really good review of exactly how to set yourself up offshore. The other offshore books that I have read do not reveal much regarding how it all works. This book walks you through the entire process. Also liked the author's style of writing. It was easy to read and entertaining in its story-like format. I would recommend it highly.
4,Simple But yet informative!,"Let me warn you so called ""experts"" of tax havens this book is very simple. Maybe, just maybe thats the reason why this book is very good in my opinion. It explains all the terms that you NEED to know in layman's terms. A lot of tax haven books are full of lawyer jargon! This book also does a pretty good job explaining things that people might not even think about when considering offshore activities such as choosing a haven with a time zone exactly like yours or similiar to it. It also explains how tax havens with U.S economic ties are a NO-NO if you really want to protect assets! And for all you really patriotic people( sorry im not!) he expalins why the U.S. is really a slavemaster taking allor most of your income and how if they lowered taxes it will actually add dollars to the economy because rich people would keep their money in the U.S.!Do yourself a favor Buy this Book and mOve OFFSHORE!"
2,Not accurate description,"Not trying to knock the item, but the description is misleading. If you are looking for the original D-I-V-O-R-C-E album, this ain't it."
4,Great,"This was really cool, the Stan Lee classics. The art was the best aswell. The famous final chapter was here and the intriduction of John Romita Sr. I really liked this and it was alot better than the stuff you buy today. Stan Lee truly was a great writer and its here I learned that (Ive never read his stuff before). This was spiderman at his best."
4,A Hiring Manager's View,I am a hiring manager in a major corporation that actively recruits and hires interns and co-ops. I recommend that aspiring summer interns and those who want year-round co-op positions read Jengyee's book. It will prepare you for finding the internship or co-op position that suits your needs and it will give you insight on what your employer expects from you. Jengyee's experiences (both the positive and not-so-positive) show students that they can and must be proactive in creating the work experience that they will learn from and enjoy. Her book is full of contemporary and accurate information written from the heart of someone who has recently experienced it!
5,Key to Success,"This book changed my attitude towards the recruiting process. I started putting more effort and time into internship hunting and treating it as a ""4-unit"" class. Tips about interviews, you might say, can be found anywhere. But messages Jengyee is sending can help you see the recruiting process from a different angle. I successfully obtained coop from IBM, and I will be an intern at Microsoft this summer. I strongly recommend this book!"
5,Complete yet concise how-to guide,"Ah, how I wish I'd had access to advice like this during my student years! In this book, the author concisely summarizes three internships and landing an entry-level position at P&G. I would recommend this book to anyone getting ready to start college and stress one of the same points the author does: start preparing for an internship NOW! I also found the author's advice on balancing the ""work-horse"" mindset and the ""social butterfly"" mindset to be a timely reminder that I need to spend more of my lunches with my work-mates."
5,Down to earth book,"This book is a good preview for all the students who have not been exposed to the job hunt, internships, and co-ops. I, myself, have just started my first internship and got a co-op and I can testify that there is a lot of useful information in this book. I found most of it very similar to my own experience.Reading it can help can help a student better understand the game of landing an internship. A good, realistic approach to the real world."
5,simple and definitely worth reading,the whole book is only 100 some pages so i'm not going to try to summarize it. the book is definitely something you can just read in a sitting. the advice given is entirely practical and can be directly applied to getting your first job or just an internship. the warnings are also good because it lets people know about potential pitfalls that otherwise might just be attributed to the weening process of internships. i'd definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to get an accurate view of the real world.
1,I Put This Out Of My Misery @64%,"Why would an employment agency exist in a world where there is no money? Why would it exist if there were really no reason to work in Limbo, as was pointed out by a couple of characters? Why would your murder have to be solved before you could move on? Maybe these questions were answered in the last 34% of the book,but I just did not care.This book was not entertaining in the least. I like ghost stories, I like murder mysteries. This book was an epic fail at both."
1,The Co-Author ignores this book in her class,"I've taken Carolyn Seefer's online English course at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill California and although it's the text that Seefer co-authored and it is the required course textbook, it's not used in the course. In my opinion that's because it's so poorly organized."
5,Howe Gelb reaches for the stars and makes it...,"Oh yeah, anything Howe Gelb touches is sure to be interesting. Still Lookin' Good To Me, the fourth album put out by one of Howe's many bands, The Band of Blacky Ranchette, is in a word, awesome. As always, he plays with some excellent musicians, Joey Burns and John Convertino of Giant Sand, Calexico and OP8, and Neko Case and John Rauhouse. Yee Haw!! If you like good music with a country-punk bent, then this is for you. And even if you don't, this is for you."
5,FAITH FOR FAITH,"John Grahamme Lake remains one of my fondest Apostlic ministers of the early 19th century. Just the revelation of compassionate faith that he shared in his time is something today's christian leader and indeed lay-man, can glean from. As you read this account you'll notice that the title is an accurate description of this man's experiences with God. He strongly believed that compassion is essentially linked with faith, especially in the areas of healing and deliverance; an ingridient that today's Tommy Tenney calls a 'Highly developed sense of injustice about satanic oppression'. Adventures in God is a very compelling and small volume sure to leave the reader wanting more, so if you would like to know more, there are excellent other books on John Lake and his teachings."
5,The best!,"I bought this book because I took a Kaplan course for the SAT and my score improved dramatically. Kaplan's books are a lot like their courses, but they don't cost hundreds of dollars and you can study on your own schedule. You can tell the people who wrote this book understand what students have to do to prepare for this test. The tips throughout the book are great and the explanations are clear and easy to understand. The best part, however, is the CD-ROM. The CD-ROM really helped me make fast progress! Good luck to you!"
4,"A Gambler, an Heiress & an interfering old man...great!","While I have the original SSE of this title, I bought the LP version since it was easier on the eyes and to save wear and tear on the original.One of the original in the famous MacGregor series, this brings us how Justin Blade meets Serena MacGregor and of course her stubborn, matchmaking but lovable father, Daniel.I enjoyed the book quite a bit and while by today's standards it may be considered boring or too tame, it was well written, very romantic with shades of humor."
1,playing the odds,"i was sent a copy that was cheaper that the one i ordered. i paid for the colectors edition and it was not sent. i registered a complaint and was told to send back the book, but was not guaranteed the one that i ordered."
5,The Best One-To-One Guide there is!,I've been involved in web development for a number of years and was in the process of developing a one to one email newsletter site when I came across this book. It soon became a major resource. I found it one of the few to talk about the role of email in the one-to-one future. Allen's book stands out as being written from knowledge - its full of practical advice as well as good insite into the web. I couldn't recommend it more.
1,Very High Level,"This book is for beginners only! Very high level. I personally have had the chance to see Beth speak and was dissapointed at the lack of knowledge this author has. I would recommend checking this book out at the local library if you must read it and spend your money on something with more substance. I would highly recommend any book by ""Peppers and Rogers"" which you can also find on Amazon."
3,Lacking Depth,I found this to be a very superficial look and the issues involved with 1:1 marketing. 1:1 is inherently high-tech. Not enough meat!
5,A Professional Tour Director's Chinatown Bible,As a professional tour director and author I'm always on the lookout for good reference books to popular cities for my tours. I am often asked to do walking tours of the Chinatown area in San Francisco and this guide is the one I refer to. It is also useful in understanding other Chinatowns in North America. It's laid out and written very well. I hope she does an updated version in 2002 or 2003.
3,MOCHACOOL AKA S'MORE READING,"This storyline was good because when you think about a young woman living with being HIV positive it grabs your attention. I wanted to enjoy this book but founded it hard each time she got dressed or was riding in a vehicle. The constant descriptions of the designer clothes and the cost of each vehicle she drove almost made me but the book down. This was a story in which every one should read because no matter what happens life goes on, however it didn't matter what she worn or what she drove as long as she set an example to others. I had to skip over all the designer names and expensive cars to finish the book."
4,Spititual Read,"After meeting Pamela M. Johnson at Bret Harte School during the Agape Book Club meeting, listening to her talk about all the research that was put into this book-I'll cry tomorrow, I just couldn't wait to read it.I really enjoyed reading I'll cry tomorrow, the book is a spititual read and very educational.You walk in the shoes of someone living HIV positive.I recommend you read the book."
4,"more dreamy vocals and solid, but not as strong as debut","more dreamy vocals and chill beats, very smooth melodies. there are a number of very solid songs, of which ""sky song"" is beautiful. as any reviewer of this band notes, anja's voice is beautiful. very underrated is ulf nygaard's voice. david bowie like, somewhat raspier, it adds much depth when it appears (spring to kingdom come, in first release, miss world was outstanding).though i like this album a lot, i do feel it lacks the edge that ""for sleepheads only"" had. ""I love music,"" and ""Kebab Shop 3 AM"" added funk to that album. ""your koolest smile,"" ""Honey's in Love"" and ""distortion"" were gripping. Feel like some of that is missing here, if you are new to the band, i would recommend starting with that disk first."
3,"Got 2. One fits great, one barely works","One fits almost perfectly onto one 26"" mountain bike, but the same model is 2"" too short for another 26"" bike of mine."
3,"20"" fits most but not all 20"" bikes","It certainly looks sturdy enough, but the 20"" kickstand does not fit a Marin Hidden Canyon 20"" bike. Even if you bought a longer carriage bolt, the mounting plate simply isn't wide enough."
4,Wald Universal 26-Inch Kickstand,"The shipping was fast and the Wald Universal 26-Inch Kickstand worked perfectly on my bike. ""The shipping package was ""Way"" to big. The kickstand was 12 inch, and the package was about 3 feet long."
2,Too short,"I bought the 16"" kickstand for my son's 16"" bike and it was about an inch too short. The bike kept falling over. Build quality was fine, but it was too small. I returned it and got a 20"" kickstand, which actually works quite well. My guess is that it would be too short for an actual 20"" bike."
3,Looks OK.,The 26-inch women's bicycle that I bought for my wife already had a kick stand - so this one is an extra.
2,"Works, but really too short","I ordered this for my son's 20"" bike (I even double-checked the size by measuring). The kickstand installs easily, but I wish it was longer. The bike leans over too far and isn't very stable when it is on its kickstand. However, it basically works, I just wish the kickstand were a little longer."
5,Anne of Green Gables for the Christian Girl/Woman,"If you are a Christian woman in need of a real heroine, who shares your desires, hopes, struggles, and fears, you will find it in Katy, the character of Mrs. Prentiss' book, Stepping Heavenward. I was so despondent of all the heroines in literature, who seem to have little to no real relationship with Christ. However, this book answered my plea and then some. I will read this over and over. Stepping Heavenward will meet you whereever you are, Christian woman! If you are sixteen, twenty-five, or eighty. This book lays the female Christian heart on the line, and does so with stunning accuracy and detail to Biblical doctrine. You will laugh, cry, be convicted, comforted and reminded over and over and over that we will be in His Kingdom because He died for us, and no other reason! And that in this present world there is hope, and sanctification will happen because He is so diligent to see to it!"
1,"Love the story, hate the editing.","Stepping Heavenward itself is an encouraging, enjoyable read; I love the story and would highly recommend it. However, Dodo Press has done a horrible job with the editing. Random words thrown in, periods in the middle of a sentence, and spaces in the middle of words litter the book and get worse as you progress through it. Many times I just had to put it down because the constant re-reading due to the poor editing was frustrating. Read the book, definitely, but do so with another publisher."
2,Beyond excellent book; Horribly edited version,"I read Stepping Heavenward and loved it so much so that I immediately purchased six copies - one to keep and five to share. Upon delivery of this particular version, I gave away the five copies and re-read my own copy. I was utterly shocked at the horrible editing of this production. I can not imagine how a publisher could print such a thing - misplaced punctuation, missing words, incorrect words. I would recommend a different version. The content of Stepping Heavenward is simply wonderful."
1,"Excellent book, very poor edition","I agree wholeheartedly with the excellent reviews of this book, but this particular edition (2008 hardcover) is an awful edition. It looks like a photocopy of a paperback (the photocopied pages being much smaller than the page area in the book) with an ugly hard cover slapped on it. I am so disappointed in the quality of this product."
4,Stepping Heavenward,I really liked this book even though it is from a earlier life time than my own. It still applies. If you want to be spiritually challenged this book is an inspiration. I would recommend this book. It is not a great book but it is enjoyable and heart warming.
1,Did not download,I downloaded this book to my kindle and while the title shows that is all. There is nothing else. When I open the book it tells me that I have finished it and to rate the book or tweet/share that I finished the book. I deleted the book and redownloaded it and the same thing happened.
5,Timeless Book,"I ordered two copies of Stepping Heavenward, one for a friend's 18th birthday and one for myself. I was please to receive the book in time for the party and in great condition. It was such a joy to pass on this book because it is one of those that changed my life. It speaks to all ages and I have heard men speak highly of it, too. It is the fictional journey of Katherine, written in journal entries, beginning on her 16th birthday until old age. But it is really about the Christian walk, being made into the image of Christ. When I first read it I could identify to the younger Katherine, and then I read it a couple years later and got something new from it, so I now have my own copy and look forward to sitting with my old ""friend"" once again!"
5,Great Inspirational Book,This book is full of grace. Read it if you are struggling to believe that God would save someone like you. I bought a whole case of these to share with the women in my life.

3,Nice!,"I liked it, very nice book, I would buy again, in addition to the good info, it had some really nice watercolor pics in it. And, as a bonus, my 7 year old gran and I painted together using this book!"
3,WATERCOLOR RIGHT FROM THE START,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK BECAUSE OF A CLASS I WAS INTERESTED IN TAKING AND YOU NEEDED THIS BOOK TO TAKE IT. I DON,T THINK I WANT TO TAKE IT NOW IF THIS IS WHAT WE WILL BE DOING . I,M SURE IT WOULD HELP ME TO LEARN ALL ABOUT COLOR BUT DON,T THINK I WOULD ENJOY DOING IT THIS WAY. I WOULD RATHER JUST LEARN AS I PAINT. IT GOES INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL I DON,T CARE IF MY LIGHT HOUSE IS PRECISE OR NOT OR MY SHADOW IS EXACTLY RIGHT .I WANT TO RELAX AND ENJOY PAINTING AND NOT MAKE IT A LOT OF HARD WORK. I PAINT FOR MY OWN ENJOYMENT. THIS IS FOR SERIOUS PAINTER. DONNA DJD"
5,Great book for kids,"When I was a kid, I loved this book so much! I made my family read it to me several times a day. Eventually, my first copy of the book became so worn out that my family had to buy me a second copy. I would recommend buying this book for young children."
4,Nice....,"I liked this book 'cuz it had quite a few really hilarious scenes. The storyline goes.... girl was in love with the guy in college but she was too much of a tomboy for him and things didn't work out and they parted on not so favourable terms.... years later he's a famous star and she's all grown up and womanly, they get stuck together on an island and the rest as they say is history..... i really liked the family setting and the part where every lady in the family turns out to be pregnant! Thats the highlight of the book! :)Read it for urself and have fun..."
4,Good choice!,"My husband and I have made several recipes from this book, and they've all been very good. Directions are easy to follow and the meals are tasty. When we're cooking for more than just the two of us, it's easy enough to just double the recipes. We like to watch what we eat, so it's great to have a cookbook that includes calorie count and nutrition information -- most cookbooks I've seen don't do that. The one thing I would like to have seen the author do differently is to include the nutritional information based on weight (eg. 3 oz. portion) or a measured portion (eg. 2 cups), rather than just ""per serving."" But overall, it's a great book."
2,"Healthy, Quick, For Two? Yes Tasty? No",This cookbook features extremely simple to prepare recipes for two people. The ingredients are all easily found in your local grocery store. The problem is the recipes are all dull and bland. For truly tasty cooking for two try the latest Sunset Cooking For Two Book.
1,Healthy Cooking for Two,Should be titled Healthy Cooking for 4-6. The recipes are probably fine but I purchased the book looking for recipes that cooked 2 servings per recipe. This book does not fit the bill. It is just like the other cook books I bought when I did need to cook for 4-6.
1,A Tempest in a Teapot,"When Columbia University announced it would no long award the Pullitzer Prize in Music to ""classical"" composers it was clear that their criteria was finally recognized as bankrupt. This follows the awarding of the last prize to a virtual unknown - Moravec - whose bland and tired music is truly fury signifying nothing. Lots of skill here - both composer and performers - but nothing to say."
1,The New Andre Caplet?,"""The Tempest"" by Paul Moravec which won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize, beating out works by Steve Reich and John Adams, is as important as the work by French composer André Caplet who won the Prix de Rome in Paris in 1901 beating out Maurice Ravel. Columbia University and the Paris Conservatory share an important distinction in being unable to recognize talent. Ravel had entered the first movement of his String Quartet while he was still a student Caplet's composition, Conte fantastique ""must here have impressed the jury with its virtuosity in depicting a catastrophe: in this case ""the sudden roaring of the floodwater."" Not unlike Moravec whose work on this recording is brilliantly performed by the Trio Solisti."
4,Good one,"Its worth for the money.... getting this sound quality with other systems less than 100 bucks is very difficult... only disadvantage i see is the length of rear speaker wires.. its not reaching the rear walls even in small rooms....apart from that, this product is worth to buy...."
4,For music only 2 of them works. For DVD its great.,"Nice sound. Looks good. Great bass.I have connected it with my Creative Audigy ZS sound card. When I watch DVD, all 5 speakers work and sound is great for a under 100$ speaker set. I am not a gamer, so I dont care about gaming sound (tried it with NFS Most Wanted BE. I was blown away). But when I listen to mp3 or any other music file, only front 2 satellite speakers work. Is there any way to make all of them work like my home theater used to do [was connected to my pc/DAP with a 1/8 to RCA, ""Y"" cable]?Edited: July 28, 2007Dumb me!! If you are having trouble to make all 5 speakers work, go to Creative EAX Console and enable CMSS 3D. :p"
2,confusion and frustration,"i bought this system a few years back, somewhere via time the leads disappeared, i want to connect to my latest Pc, bought leads from a reputable retailer but for the life of me cannot seem to channel from my pC to the sound system,any help please from Amazon customers ?"
3,Ok speakers for the price,"every now and again, the speakers will strart to buzz for a few seconds and then stop. Other than that, they work pretty well. Unfortunately I have a imac, so I do not get the whole surround sound effect. I can get so three out of the five speakers work, plus the subwoofer. Still trying to find an external soundcard that will work for my imac and speakers."
5,Good Sound System for the Computer,"This is an amazing sound system for the computer. For a true 5.1 sound, the pc needs to have a sound card that supports 5.1 and 3 3.5 outputs for the woofer,front and rear speakers. For those who have the traditional single 3.5 output(but the sound card supports 5.1), a usb adapter for 5.1 is needed. If you use the auxillary input, you'll only get a 2.1 effect.I think one main drawback of this system is the length of the rear speaker wires. And they cannot be also supplemented with additional wiring.This restricts the placement of the rear speakers.But the price and the quality of the speakers is unbeatable. Overall it's a very good buy..~kaustav ghoshal"
5,Creative Inspire P5800 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System,For the price this system is excellent. My 14 yr. old daughter had no trouble hooking this up to her computer or Zen. Sound Quality is excellent. Surprised that there is so much sound from such a small speaker system.
4,For Red Sox Fans Young And Old,"The plot of ZACHARY'S BALL is basic enough: it tells the story of Zachary and his father attending a baseball game, Zachary's father catching a ball, and the dream that the young man has when he falls asleep. Tavaraes accomplishes three things in this book. First, he beautifully tells the story of a touching father/son memory. He also writes about his love of baseball. Perhaps the book's greatest accomplishment is the way in which he brings Fenway Park and the Red Sox to life. The Red Sox are one of the more magical and mythical teams in baseball and fit well into Tavares' tale.Young readers will love the book, but it will definitely touch a chord with Red Sox fans young and old."
5,bck2schl,the product came right on time for me to start school and yes i would use this again for my next semester
5,"mute math ""flesh and bones electric fun"" live dvd","this is one of the top ten live dvd concert videos of all time, with the new ""u2 3d"" live concert/movie coming out soon also in the top ten. as far as the passing of time and our kids listening to the favorites from the past that we loved this is right up there together with ""stop making sense"" by talking heads.my 22yr old son just introduced me to mute mate this past year and he was raised to the talking heads stop making sense live concert/movie at a VERY early age and flesh and bones is his newest favorite live dvd concert."
5,Brilliant. Worth every penny.,"When I read Optimal Thinking, I understood why I had been so confused about positive and negative thinking. Optimal Thinking is the universal language of our best self and makes complete sense. The Optimal Thinking audio CD program helped me to take the leap from being an occasional optimal thinker to using Optimal Thinking automatically. The information is original, the 12 CD's are fun to listen to, the action steps in the activities workbook are easy and make optimal thinking and results a natural part of daily life. I can't recommend this audio CD set highly enough.[...]"
4,GREAT BIKE/SKATEBOARD FOR NEW RIDERS,"Saw this bikeboard at Fred Meyer's a year and a half ago. My son refused to learn how to ride his bike, and i was nervous about him using a skateboard.I bought this bike in a boy version, (which I don't see here)and it was the hit of the neighborhood! Young kids and older teens enjoyed playing around on it. It is very beat up now,and my son now rides his bike. We keep it around just because it gets used here and there. BUY IT!"
5,A BLAST!!,"My family had this video for a few years, and I can truly say that it is one of the best movies I have ever watched. The movie itself is fun, but yet shows the ups and downs of a father son relationship in a prejudiced society.There are also a lot of funny one liner, like when the main charchter refers to his son as being ""Hickory Bronze"", the same colour as a car, or when her learns the hard way, that being black does not mean you can play B-Ball.I great movie for ALL members of the family.Highly recommended"
5,Just as good as I had remembered,"I saw this movie many years ago. I knew then, Denzel Washington would be a big star. I played it for my family and they loved it too."
4,Absolutely beautiful packaging & violet fragrance,"The violet fragrance of the lip balm is really good, and the vintage inspired packaging is very beautiful. As a basic petrolatum lipbalm, the quality is pretty good, and the scent is pleasant to apply. It's also very cute to carry around. I gave 4 stars because it's practically like a fragranced petroleum jelly - it feels as though it softens and moisturizes only on the surface."
2,Warning for those with food coloring/dye sensitivities!,"This lip balm in Apple (not in stock as of review-writing) is how I discovered I am allergic to food coloring & food dyes! I had literally never had a reaction to artificially colored skin or food products before, but this made my lips burn and split open bleeding each time I used it.Positives: It smelled and felt GREAT up until the allergic reactions! If you can handle the colorings & dyes, by all means go for it and it should treat you well, but be wary if you have any sort of autoimmunity because these things get worse over time. Very sad day when you do, because you'll have to chuck your lovely lip balm and its pretty tin!"
3,"The music is wonderful, but the noises clutter the music.","I love Vivaldi's work very much; especially The Four Seasons. I just found the background noises somewhat annoying. The sounds fit the music, but it is better without the excess noise. I reccomend you buy the traditional version."
1,"""for the birds""","I really don't think this is what Vivaldi had in mind! The bird sounds are very annoying and diminish the beauty of Vivaldi's music. As a professional musician and college instructor, I would not reccomend this recording."
5,Awesome book,"This book is awesome!!! Our teacher is new and doesn't explain things well. I understood many things for the first time after reading this book. There are many questions with solutions in the text, which really helps. The practice exams are very doable after reading the review chapters."
3,"good review, bad practices","good reviews, you can probably even take it as a textbook, however, the practices have no thorough explanations, but to say that one of the practice exam is extremely hard"
2,A Little Disappointing,"I am an AP Calculus teacher and was collecting materials to use in my classroom. This book is fine in the information it presents and does have 5 sample tests (3 AB, 2 BC). But the book is lacking in worksheets (only 3 for the whole text). It has a chapter in the table of contents (Annotated Solutions to Past Free Rsponse Questions) that is nothing more than the URL of the companies web site, which in turn just provides a link to the college board web site. The overall production quality is mediocre. I would recommend the Princeton Review book over this one by a wide margin. Maybe if you want another source of sample test questions this book may be worthwhile."
5,a big help!,"After taking both the Calculus and Computer Science AP exams (both of which I prepared for with the ""Be Prepared"" books) I can safely say that this book is definitely worth studying from. For Spanish and U.S. History I used Barron's, but for Calc and CompSci I liked the Be Prepared books a lot more, and I'm happy with all the results."
5,Great review book,"Unfortunately I procrastinated my AP studying this year and barely studied for AP Calculus BC at all (really, this was due less to procrastination and more to the fact that I understood the material quite well and didn't really need to review). I read this book in the week leading up to the exam. I didn't do any of the practice questions, but it was still a huge help. I'm not sure how helpful this book is for someone who needs serious review work, but for me, who only needed a refresher, it was great."
5,Even better than the first,"This is a very funny book that chronicles the life of Jessica Darling's senior year of high school. I liked it even better than ""Sloppy Firsts"" for many reasons. The main reason is MARCUS FLUTIE! I dont want to give away the ending or anything but Jessica and his relationship is all the more better in this novel. Marcus Flutie is by far the sexiest male character in any book that I have ever read (I probably sound weird for saying this).This is my favorite book and I recommend it to all..."
5,Great Book!!,"I hated to read before I read the prequel Sloppy Firsts and this book Second Helpings. I could not put them down and would recommend this book to any teenage girl. It deals with the drama that we face everyday with friends and relationships and teaches you lessons about love, life, and following your dreams!! Read this book if you haven't already"
5,Sooo on target,"I really enjoyed Sloppy Firsts. And I was enjoying the first part of Second Helpings, where Jessica is attending a summer program. And then I read on to the part of the book where she goes back to high school for her senior year... and as I was reading I started thinking to myself, this book is beyond just good, it's incredible. This is the BEST and most honest observation of high school I have ever read. And funny, and fun to read and....I've already read it twice, it is THAT good. Trust me, even if you're out of high school, you'll love this book."
5,Second possibly better than 'Firsts'!,"If you've read Sloppy Firsts and loved it, there is NO WAY that you can miss Second Helpings.Megan picks up right where she left off without missing a beat. All of the characters are back and better than ever. .:|Marcus Flutie? Him. Yes, him. :)|:.This book has some great surprises, don't ever be too sure you know what's going to happen. Jessica Darling is one of the best characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about, she's so REAL. This definitely does not succumb to Sucky Sequel Syndrome, give it a chance."
5,Second Helpings,"I cannot believe how great this book was! It's worthy of a million stars! I felt like I was actually inside Jessica Darling's mind, feeling the same things she does. I am even somewhat like her, even though I disagree with her feelings and actions sometimes. I thought she should have done something about her feelings for Marcus right away, but once I finished I realized that the events and the book is perfect just the way they are. I will be right at the book store in April to buy Charmed Thirds!"
5,Very Well Written,"After mid-terms, my friend recommended Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings to me, and I took them home to check them out.Let me say that I read both in under three days.I was hooked from the start. As a teenager, I could relate to a lot of the feelings that Jessica Darling has. Progressing through her years in high school, she continues to turn her thoughts to Marcus Flutie who seems to show up in unexcepected places, and you'll find out the rest once you've read this book (unless other reviewers have inconsiderately ruined it for you).I thought this was an excellent book, although I woudn't recommend it for kids not in high school. Its mature content might be a little too eye-opening for younger kids, but to anyone old enough, it's a must read! You'll be captivated by Marcus Flutie..I know I was!(But back off..he's mine! :-P)"
5,Second Helpings : A Novel .... by Megan McCafferty,"by: kaitlyn , DHS High School.This book was amazing. Jessica Darling starts the year out very top of her senior class, 4 year cross-country veteren and captain, and determined to have a way better year than the last. She kept and achived only one of these. She dealt with the troubling (non?)relationship between her and He-who-shall-remain-nameless, i.e. Marcus and the pain of having her best friend live 1000 miles away from her. She denies feelings, breaks and remends relationships with her crazy parents, and trys to figure out where the heck she wants to go to collage. Through it all, she tells her life stories very comically, but in a way you can relate to almost too well. This is one of the best books I've ever read; it contains everything you could ever want: it's extremely funny, uncannily realistic, and has you rooting for Jessica in the end (to finally get together with ... ?)."
2,as hot as snow,"this is filth. it has the depth of mooch, the cat. i loath the book with characters this dull. give me liberty, or give me this book. it reeks of a horrible stench of unoriginality. find it, read it, and be released to a new perspective. that these books well...you know."
4,"Read Opal Mehta Instead! But Good Book, Too","I'm very very very mad that Megan tried to get another writer (of a better book called Opal Mehta) in trouble just because that book copied a little bit from her, so I took off one star. But that book is really good! I read it and wrote a book report for school and then my teacher told me the story about copying. Well, she has already apologized and so I hope she doesn;t get in any trouble. She is at Harvard and already made millions of dollars for teh book and I think other people are just jealous and trying to get her in trouble, but she won't be in trouble at all because she admitted she made a mistake! So there! When I grow up I want to be a writer too and I hope no one will be so jealous of me!"
2,Charmingly inept,"As funny and well-paced these novels are, I can't help but compare them to Curtis Sittenfeld's Prep. The protagonist of McCafferty's novels is shallow, superficial and immodest. It makes me cringe to think that teenagers would consider her a role model. On the other hand, Prep's leading character is honestly struggling to find herself through high school and goes through some truly believeable and honest and relatable experiences. Maybe I am old fashioned at the age of 25, but I would've liked to see Jessica Darling treat sex as something other than a purely phyiscal ""right"" of which it would be shameful to have not obtained by the ripe old age of 17. These novels contribute to the sad truth that society and media put too much pressure on young girls to look a certain way and have sex when you are still a kid. Of course people evolve as time and culture evolve, but you would think that maybe writers today would encourage upholding morals and dignity.... oh well."
3,Strangely fascinating...,"Megan McCafferty's ""Second Helpings,"" the latter half of the Jessica Darling duology (is that a word?), gripped me in an unexpected way. I got the book out of the library in order to see what Macmillan was publishing and upon cracking it open was less than enthralled - typical YA fare, I thought. High school hierarchy, boyfriend troubles, and a rich variety of sexual practices. As McCafferty's heroine might say, whoop-freakin'-de-doo.But the bizarre thing was, I found myself oddly engrossed by the sarcastic voice telling the story. It was so annoying it was transfixing. Before long I had read the whole book and still find myself dipping into it again and again (as of this writing, I have to return it in five days). Though the stuff the tale is made of is irritatingly familiar and occasionally stupid, the way Jessica narrates the story is believable and usually intelligent - and this is the book's greatest strength."
5,There's no doubt he is the champion.,"Because he's not only the champion OF the arena, but the champion IN the arena."
2,Maybe you should buy one size larger.,"Seemed to fit just right and be well constructed. However after the initial wash following the manufacturer's care instructions, they shrank width and lengthwise. Had to pass them on to someone smaller than myself."
5,Oh My..,"These ""shorts"" are the first shorts I have worn in many years.. They fit, look good, and are just the ""best""!Oh my.. I am ""sold"" on CARHARTT.."
4,Great work shorts,"Incredibly durable work shorts. They are a bit thick and may not breathe well in the summer, but they seem like they'll last forever. Really handy pocket placements abound and the fit was just right. I would have given them five stars but one of the three pairs I received was missing a belt loop. Not a big deal, but not a perfect product either."
1,No value for money,Ordinary looking steel mug. It does not have a lid which defeats the purpose of having doube insulation. I did not find the quality of insulation that great either. Too pricey for the features it offers.
3,Wish I'd gotten it on sale.,"This mug was one of ""Today's Deals"" when I first decided to order it. By the time I got back to my cart it was $25 instead of $10 or $15. It looks good & it fits well in the Kuerig 1-cup coffee maker, but $25 is too much."
4,Great mug but expensive,"it should be $9.99 mug, but you pay for the nice design, this is what I was expecting before I order it.it is works great with the coffe warmers, it is actually my main reason to get this ."
1,Absolutely no value!,"The only european characteristic of this cup is it's price. The picture is deceiving - this thing is tiny. I could only put three of my fingers through it's ear. I am definitely returning it to Amazon - in my mind, it's worth 5 bucks and is more of a for a kid than an adult."
4,"Strong start, then lingers","Horan did an excellent job in writing the first third of the book. Captain Thomas Hines was an interesting character in History. Horan's telling of how Hines assisted John Hunt Morgan on his raid and his escape was truly fascinating reading. However, that's only the first third of the book. The rest of the book centers on the ""Northwest Conspiracy"", and quite frankly, it is a rather ponderous tome."
2,"hard to control, warped bits","I got this tool as part of a set. i was very excited, i thought i'd never have to use my chisels to clean up the edge of some my wood working projects, boy was i wrong, as others have said it takes a large, uneven bite. I would think that with practice that uneven bite problem could be fixed. however while trying to get it to work right, the blade got warped some how, making it impossible to make a good cut, so i bought a second bit and was extremely careful with it, and it still warped. I have removed this tool from my dremel kit"
2,Poor Design,"Not adjustable at all.I needed this to shave off a little bit of wood backing that was sticking out 1/8"" from behind some book shelves I built. The problem is that the planer is only designed to be used in one direction. If you can't use it in the direction they want you to, you are out of luck. Also, you can't change the depth of the cut, so if you don't want that deep or shallow of a cut, you are out of luck there too.I ended up using the planing bit without the casing, and had better luck doing it that way, but it wasn't perfect like I was hoping the kit would be able to provide.I would have given it only one star except that I was able to use the planing bit alone for what I needed. That is why two stars."
3,Not what expected,"Not the best design. Have to keep pressure against the tool to keep it on the dremel. Hard to use on the top of a door, the video shows it as very easy to use."
2,Good Idea wrong tool,I burned up my brand new XPR400 with this little gadget. I trimmed off maybe 1/4 inch off of 3 doors. By the 3rd door the motor was sounding rough. The motor burned up the next day using it with a cut off wheel. This attachment makes the unit get realllly hot. The tool is turning a really large blade compared to anything else you turn with it. To top that off with the end of the blade isnt supported by anything it just fits in a hole and rides metal on metal. Dremel says the blade is designed to last as long as the attachement 500 BF. I did about 200 and its pretty much ground off (Very old Pine).I think if you keep the motor well blown out. Dont over tax it and plane a fair amount of 3/4 or less wide your good to go. It really works well. 3 or 4 10 minute sessions on a 1.5 inch door will prove to much for this little tool IMO.I'm going to see if Dremel will honor the warranty. I will let you all know.-Mark
1,didn't work for my dremel tool.,"the only reason i am giving this product this rating is because it originally said it would fit my dremel, but that was untrue."
1,Parts missing...,"The bit on my planer snapped and I could not find a replacement bit. Therefore, I purchased the whole PL400 expecting the attachment and the bit in the box (as pictured). However, only the attachment was in the supposedly unopened Dremel box. I would like a refund/replacement...."
5,A good tool,"Its a very nice accessory for my Dremel. Its works very well.Its fast and solid. The material is very good, its Dremel :)I recommended if u work whit wood."
3,Son love it but not great quality,My 4 year old loves this watch. I am disappointed that the plastic face is already getting scratched just after a week.
2,kids watch with lizards,very cute but useless as a teaching watch due to the fact that the size of minute (not hour) numbers are too small to see.
2,Not Water Resistant as Advertised,"My daughter loves lizards so she loves this watch. However, we are on our second one because the first one got water bubbles in it after about a year and slowly corroded. I checked the water resistance claim by Timex and they say it is waterproof down to 10 meters. Well, it is not! The second watch got bubbles in it after the first dip in the pool. It took almost a month for the water to finally evaporate. Suffice it to say, my daughter takes her watch off before swimming now. Next watch will be one that is really waterproof since my daughter is a swimmer."
1,"Lasted one week, not water resistant.","We bought this as a gift for our son on a special occassion. One week later, in a shallow pool and after splashing around for only a few minutes, it stopped working. Replacing the battery (at 1/3 the cost of the watch) did nothing. Takes a licking? No, it didn't even take a gentle splash."
4,Great first watch for 4-10 year olds,"Inexpensive, cute watch with a face big enough and easy enough to read. Great for teaching young kids how to tell time.There are no frills here. The Indiglo light is a plus. The boys love it.Be prepared to buy a new battery. My son's died the day after he got it for Christmas."
5,Great watch for toddlers,"This is the perfect watch!! I have been searching for a watch for my 4 year old son and this turned out to be the best we've found. I saw some other timex watches but I guess they were a junior size, this size is perfect for my son's tiny wrist, it adjusts perfect and has a lot of length on the wrist so it can fit when he grows up. The first thing we did with this watch was to go to the pool, my son wore it during a whole day of swimming and playing at the pool and it worked perfectly, it even has a light that he loves, the little geckos are cute, I would definitely recomend this watch...we really love it, and the price is perfect!!"
5,amazing gift to your child,"amazing gift to your child, well made quality watch, light and easy to wear, small but numbers big enough to read, insurance from timex, highly recommended"
4,Good product,Perfect for kids. The yellow and green lizards move while the seconds advance and the indigo light is exciting for my kid. He is learning quickly to read the time.
4,nice,"I bought this for my soon to be 5 year old for his birthday. so far looks like a great watch and the lizards move around the face which is cute. my only complaint is that the numbers that convert the clock face into minutes (i.e. next to the 1 there's a 5) are very small, I bought because it had those numbers so it would be easier for him to learn to tell the time but will see how he goes."
3,"Adequate, little more.","There are no false claims in the description so I can't blame anyone but myself. I purchased the watch for my six-year-old son. He likes animals and I wanted him to be able to use an analog watch/clock. This should do nicely. When I received the watch, I was a bit embarrassed to give it to him. It is small and skinny. The picture makes the band look wider than it. The print describes the band as 16 mm and I suppose it is. I just expected more substance. Perhaps my expectations were too high for an inexpensive kid's timepiece."
4,Cute watch,"My 8 year old loved it; cute lizards revolving around the face. Would be nice if the band actually had a clasp instead of just sliding through a metal slider with teeth, doesn't hold very well and I can see it shredding soon, but so far so good."
4,They mean TINY!,"These are really cute little earrings. However, they are so tiny, it just looks like little squiggles in my ears. I have to hold them right up to my eye to see that they are actually snakes. The workmanship is nice and the product description is accurate."
3,"good, not perfect","As another reviewer points out, it is good to read a book with the facts on Margaret Tobin Brown. Iversen writes well. There is some academic women's studies-type jargon that doesn't fit in well, and makes me wonder if Iversen felt obligated to put it in.I would have liked to read more about her time in Leadville and her last years in Europe, both of which are covered pretty sparingly. The Titanic episode seems to be retold about three times, but I guess that's how you sell books."
5,"The Best Book Written About Margaret ""Molly"" Brown","Kristen Iversen went beyond what must people think they know about Molly Brown. With her book we got to meet the real Margaret Brown. Margaret, Who in a time when women were suppose to stay home, take care of hubby and the kids wanted more out of life and she went for it. Margaret gave and gave and never wanted anything back but respect and she so deserved it. There wasn't anyone or anything she wouldn't help with. I have so much more respect for Margaret Brown. If you want the truth buy this book"
2,Not very helpful...,I bought this to learn how to adjust my emergency brake and discovered it isn't even mentioned in the book!It is also printed on very cheap paper with poor photographic reproduction so is of limited usefulness.I wouldn't buy another book in this line.
4,Great Fun!,"I automatically approve of anything that is tongue-in-cheek. Agent 15 is a collection of 6 webisodes of a James Bond spoof starring the divine Paget Brewster(aka Miss Indestructible). The episodes are brief, sadly, but contain many things I enjoy: action, beautiful women, a guest appearance by Hymen Slymenestra of GWAR, and a great big heaping helping of humor. But I only give 4 stars out of five for two reasons: 1.) the ""behind-the-scenes"" features consist solely of lenghty rehearsals for part of a fight scene in one particular episode; and 2.) for no more content than this DVD contains, I feel that the price is too high, Try to find a used copy, if you can."
2,Looked great in the pictures,"But tinny, particularly the saucer and not something I would want to use for guests. We put them in the re-gift pile."
4,Let's be honest,"When a product description starts with ""German company WMF..."" Amazon should also make it clear that these are made in China. They are of high quality, but I'd like to know that slaves are making my luxury goods before I buy them, thanks!"
5,TOP SHELF,"William Saroyan was brought to my attention by Jack Kerouac's early writings in ""Upon An Underwood."" I can see why Kerouac was turned on by Saroyan...and so am I. This book of stories is very inspiring because, in a good-natured way, it defies the conformist rules and regulations that ""academic literature"" tries to enforce upon young writers. It's as funny as it is insightful...and even a bit bizarre. It easily belongs on the TOP SHELF of any library.Its value is timeless."
5,So glad I got this,"I read about Saroyan in Closing Time (Heller's disappointing sequel to Catch-22), I was inspired to pick up this book and I'm so glad I did. I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book, and so far the preface remains my favorite part. Fortunately, that's because it's an amazing preface that, brief as it may be, would have been just barely worth the purchase price all on its own. This is, of course, not an issue, because so far every story has been a bite-sized morsel of goodness. Especially great for the sort of person who likes to read a few short stories in one sitting, they're compact and plentiful and thoroughly satisfying. So... get this book."
3,"Not bad, could be better","Almighty is always surprising with their covers and remixes; unfortunately sometimes not for good... and this is one of those times. I really expected a lot more from this remakes, considering that almighty has its great moments of glory when remixing an old track. These remixes are very predictable since the editing is kind of boring and repetitive with nothing but an extended drum beat intro and ending, leaving the fair part in 2 middle sections separated by another boring drum beat section. The Definitive remix is a little more Trance than the Anthem that is more House. I stick to the original remixes released on April 2006, specially the Collaboration Remix. However Lifedance versions are good for relaxing or used as ambient music in a dinner."
5,A treasure trove of NT research,"Kummel's work is vast in scope, deep in research and precise in detail. While this book is not as readable as other NT intros, its intent is more to be used as a reference than a cover-to-cover read. Kummel's method is thorough--he presents the major schools of thought among scholars on a given topic, then offers his own view. It is notable that Kummel holds several opinions that go against the majority view on several issues (e.g., that Acts wasn't written by a companion of Paul and thus not by Luke the physician). Whether he agrees with the leading opinions or not, he formulates his arguments meticulously. This is a great resource for the serious NT student. Highly recommended."
5,Frickin' A,"I was so excited Frickin' A was on this Now 18. They are so awesome! You defiently need to buy their cd ""Big Egos, No Ideas"" They are awesome you can listen to their cd over and over again and not get sick of! As a matter of fact i am listening to it right now! Defiently need to buy that cd if you like ""Jesse's Girl"" !"
1,dumb kid...they flopped,"flops that won't be featured on here as reported earlier this morning-""over"" by lindsay flophan 1hitwonder-""do sumthin"" by britney hasbeen-""not that kinda girl"" by jo1hitwonder jo-""one word"" by white girl who can't fight, is jealous of the hatees she hates, and is a 1-hit-wonder wannabe"
5,Fricken A,"For those who dont know who they are..........the cd is worth it for just them. Their cd that this awsome track is pulled from is ""big egos, no ideas,"" which is a cd that you can listen to from front to back and love every song.the band is massively talented, and if you havent found that out already, make sure you check them out."
3,My Prediction List for Now 19,"This Review is Written By: Person (Since You Can't Write Two Reviews)Pop""Rich Girl"" Gwen Stefani/Eve""Incomplete"" Backstreet Boys""Get Right"" Jennifer Lopez""Dirty Laundry"" Lisa Marie PresleyHip-Hop/Rap/R&B;/All That Kind Of Stuff""Candy Shop"" 50 Cent""Goin' Crazy"" Natalie""Lonely"" Akon""Girl"" Destiny's Child""Don't Phunk With My Heart"" Black Eyed Peas""Baby I'm Back"" Baby Bash/Akon""Okay"" Nivea/Lil' Jon""Girlfight"" Brooke Valentine""Oh"" Ciara/LudacrisRock""Let Me Go"" 3 Doors Down""Almost"" Bowling For Soup""You And Me"" Lifehouse""The Geeks Get The Girls"" American Hi-Fi""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"" U2""We Believe"" Good CharlotteCountry""Making Memories Of Us"" Keith Urban"
2,My Least Fav Now,"I only liked about 8 songs on the CD.So, I give it 2 stars.Buy it if it's less than $10 like at a used CD store or something."
2,No good,"I have liked other previous Nows (2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, & 16). But I really did not like this one.I'm deciding between 1 and 2 stars.I only liked 5 SONGS! The ones by U2, Gwen Stefani, Snoop Dogg, Nelly, and Hoobastank. The others I could careless for, and are not good.If you ask me, a lot fo these 5 star reviews seem weird. Like some with only one sentence, and some that look like they might be on the wrong product.In the end, I've gone with 2 stars. But, if Now 19 doesn't work, I don't know how many Now discs I will continue to buy.P.S. Remember their old slogan ""Get the hits you crave NOW!""? Well, I'm certainly not craving much of these! Try again NOW!"
2,I could easily make a better mix,"If I made a mix the songs I'd put on it would be:Holiday, Green DayIt's my Life, Bon JoviOcean Avenue, YellowcardThe Rock Show, Blink 182Take Me Out, Franz Ferdinand1985, Bowling for SoupVertigo, U2Kryptonite, 3 Doors DownBoulevard of Broken Dreams, Green DayCold, CrossfadeThen the Morning Comes, Smash MouthGirls and Boys, Good CharlotteThe Reason, HoobastankLife of a SalesMan, yellowcardWhite Wedding, Billy IdolDon't buy Now 18."
1,Worst album of the Now collection so far,Now 18 hardly has any good songs. There is nothing worth listening to.
4,Geting Better! and My Prediction for Now 19!,Now 18 It's al right. I like it. It has some of the best songs of 2004 and 2005!My Prediction for Now 191.Black Eyed Peas: Don't Funk With My Heart2.Amerie: 1 Thing3.Mariah Carey feat. Jermaine Dupri: It's Like That4.Ludacris: #1 Spot5.50 Cent feat. Olivia: Candy Shop6.Ciara feat. Ludacris: Oh7.Brook Valentine feat. Big Boi and Lil Jon: Girl Fight8.Nivea feat.

4,Prediction Time,"Here are my thoughts on the next album(I don't know 100% about music so I don't know all the artist's names).Girlfight, Incomplete, Ordinary People, Switch, Hollaback Girl (or Rich girl), Oh, Somebody Told Me, Baby I'm Back, Ass Like That (or Mockingbird), Since You've Been Gone (or behing these Hazel Eyes), Sunday Morning, It's Like That (or we Belong Together), This is How We Do (or Hate It Or Love It), Candy Shop (or Disco Inferno), Independence Day (or vehicle), I don't Want To Be, Lonely No More, American Idiot (or Boulivard of Broken Dreams), Look What You've Done, Jerk It Out , and Girl. This Should Be a preview of what comes out July 19."
3,This is alright,"They actually started now 18 off with no rap! They put u2 first, when u2's usually closer towards the end of the album in previous nows. lindsay lohan's and good charlotte's songs have the same meaning, & they both suck. snoop dogg, destinys child, nelly, frankie j, & howie day r overplayed. chevelles alright, and 3 days grace sucked. every 1 else gets luke warm ratings from me.Heres what now 19 should pretty much look like:1. Rich Girl- Gwen Stefani2. Dont You- Pussycat Dolls3. 1 Thing- Amerie4. Get Right- J. lo5. Dont Phunk With My Heart- Blackeyed Peas6. Oh- Ciara f/ Ludacris7. Like You- Daddy Yankee8. Girl- Destinys Child9. Baby I'm Back- Baby Bash10. Lonely- AKON11. Goin' Crazy- Natalie12. Incomplete- The Backstreet Boys13. Adams Song- blink 18214. Helena- My Chemical Romance15. Almost- Bowling For Soup16. Scars- Papa Roach17. Let Me Go- 3 Doors Down18. The Clincher- Chevelle19. Beverly Hills- Weezer20. Live Like You Were Dying- Tim McGraw"
1,Lame,What an awful collection of tunes aside from Snoop Dog's radio friendly rap.These Now collections just keep on getting lamer and lamer.
2,Below-Average Now,"Vertigo -- C-What You Waiting For -- BRumors -- C-Drop It Like It's Hot -- ASoldier -- A-Only U -- BBalla Baby -- CUsed To Love You -- FOver And Over -- A+Obsession -- A+O -- D-Collide -- FDissappear -- CVitamin R -- FHome -- FLady -- C+I Just Wanna Live -- B-Jesse's Girl -- FTangled Up In Me -- C-You're My Better Half -- FOverall -- D+ (69%)-- Now can do much better than this. Only half of the songs on this CD should even be on here, and still some of those aren't even that good."
3,Real Prediction List for Now 19.,Hope they make it better this time! There's been quite some omminissions off the last 2! Here's what most likely will be on...1. Gwen Stefani- Hollaback Girl2. Backstreet Boys- Incomplete3. Black Eyed Peas- Don't Phunk With My Heart4. Ciara f/ Ludacris- Oh5. Bobby Valentino- Slow Down6. J. Lo f/ Fat Joe- Hold You Down7. Baby Bash f/ Akon- Baby I'm Back8.

Coldplay- Speed of Sound15. 3 Doors Down- Behind Those Eyes or Let Me Go16. Chevelle- The Clincher17. Garbage- Bleed Like Me18. Crossfade- Colors19. The Mars Volta- The Widow20. Lifehouse- You & Me
1,let truth be said,"ciara n jojo are 1-hit-wonders.ciara's goodies was her only hit. she became a kiddie star after urban smart talents found out she untalented.1, 2 step flopped (thaz y not on her)oh floppedjojo's only hit was ""leave."""
3,"good, but, could be better","okay, I know everybody thinks this album stinks, and I agree. There are sum good songs like ""over and over"" by nelly, ""only u"" by ashanti, and ""obsession"" by frankie J, balla baby(chingy).But, then theres, Keith Urban,skye sweetnam,and Lenny Kravitz. I mean, seriously, why put those people on Now 18 instead of better artists that dont sing country? like, on every NOW cd, at the end there has to be about 3 country songs!!plz, no more country, get to the good stuff!!Now 19(should be songs)1.how we do (50cent and the game)2. u got it bad (usher)3.candy shop (50 cent and olivia)4.get right (Jennifer Lopez)5.man I used to be (k-os)6.American Idiot (Green day)7.Mr. brightside (the killers)8. how could you? (mario)9.signs (snoop dog w\Justin Timberlake)10.lonely (akon) luv this song11.dont funk with my heart (black eyed peas)12. we belong together (mariah carey) good song! I hope they put sum of these songs on the next one, cuz, im not sure if i even want to buy them nemore!!"
3,Now 18s alright. but this is what would be better,"1. Number One Spot (Ludacris)2. Just a Lil Bit (50 Cent)3. Mockingbird/Just Lose It/Like Toy Soldiers (Eminem)4. N Dey Say (Nelly)5. Im A Hustla (Cassidy)6. Numb Encore (Jay Z and Linkin Park)7. Whacha Gon Do? (Lil Jon And The Eastside Boys)8. Move Around (Bump J)9. Yeah! (Usher, Lil Jon, Ludacris)10.

Changes (2pac)16. Heart Of A Champion (Nelly)17. Hate It Or Love It (The Game and 50 Cent)18. Breathe (Fabulous)19. Welcome To My Life (Simple Plan)20. Cold (Crossfade)"
4,Great mix as usual,Highlights:1. Vertigo U24. Drop It Like It's Hot Snoop Dogg featuring Pharrell5. Soldier Destiny's Child featuring T.I. and Lil Wayne9. Over and Over Nelly featuring Tim McGraw12. Collide Howie Day13. Disappear Hoobastank16. Lady Lenny Kravitz
3,OK,"Now 18 is OK. It's starts with my favorite song on the CD, Vertigo. Actually that's the only really good song on the CD. There are couple of other good/decent songs on the track but, other than that it's not very good. the Now people are putting too many rap and R&B songs on their CD's. they need to put more pop/rock songs on their CD's. I was expecting to see at least one Green Day song on this CD but, not one ended up on the CD. I don't reccomend this CD. I would download the good songs of i tunes or something like that. I would also reccomend a Green Day, simple plan, or yellowcard CD instead."
2,Now that's what I call horrible!!,"What is going on with the Now series? The last one was horrible and this one is even worse. There are only five songs out of 20 that I like, that is not even close to being worth a purchase. Some of these weren't even hits as far as I know. They need to come up with much better material for the next Now CD, I know there are great hit songs that can be compiled."
2,Now 18,"The first couple of songs are good, but a couple of these it's clear the recording artist company's paid Now 18, I am a very pop culture person and listen to the radio and watch MTV, MTV2, and VH1, I mean Omarion ""O"" I've seen adversting for that but nothing on the radio.Really, Now 18 needs to stop putting country and songs that aren't even popular.Only if they wanna sell a CD."
1,This CD Sucks!,"The folks who made The Now CD series needs to keep up with what's really HOT! If I was the person who is in charge of the NOW series, I would get it off from the computer and create my own NOW CD series-It's a good thing to do it.Here are my predictions for NOW 19: 1.50 Cent: ""Disco Inferno"" or ""Candy Shop"" 2. The Game: ""How We Do"" 3. JET: ""Look What You've Done"" 4. The Killers: ""Mr. Brightside"" 5. Snoop Dogg: ""Signs"" 6. Mariah Carey: ""It's Like That"" 7. Gavin DeGraw: ""Chariot"" 8. Nivea, ""Okay"" 9. Ciara, ""Oh!"" 10. Eminem: ""Mockingbird"" 11. Jesse McCartney: Beautiful Soul 12. Nina Sky: ""Turnin' Me On"" 13. Lindsay Lohan: ""Over"" 14. Will Smith: ""Switch"" 15. The Goo Goo Dolls: ""Give a Little Bit"" 16. Nelly, ""And They Say..."" 17. Papa Roach, ""Scars"" 18. My Chemical Romance, ""I'm Not OK"" 19. The Zutons, ""Pressure Point"" 20. Simple Plan: ""Shut Up, Shut Up, Shut Up!"""

5,Wee Geordie,"Wee Geordie, as it was known in the US, is surely the sweetest movie we had ever seen and remained a favorite. Ned Devine is a close second!"
3,Really more silver than chrome.,"It's really much more of a dull silver than chrome. For small/minor touch-ups it works, but don't expect the result to be anything close to being shiny. So-so product."
2,"Silver, not chrome.","I suspected this would be silver rather than the chrome I needed, but for the discounted price I thought I'd give it a try anyway. By the way, nowhere on the package does it indicate the color other than ""cap indicates color."" Hard to believe the list price of this 1/3 oz. paint pen was over $20."
1,Not true,"IT says it is Chrome paint, might of just went to hardware store and bought silver paint would have got the same look."
1,Not Chrome as Described,"The description of Chrome on this item is not correct, it is Silver Metallic as available from any other dealer.Do not know how it can get any higher star than one or none."
2,Not for sink stopper paint repair,"Didn't meet my expectations for painting sink stopper. It wore off almost immediately, even though I had let it dry for a good length of time."
1,Nothing like chrome..was sent a dull silver pen in error,"I ordered this ""chrome"" pen and was sent a dull silver pen in error and I cant return it or get a refund and I just received it today. Big ripoff and a complete waste of money. Dont buy this pen. There was no paperwork in the box and no refunds even if they send you the wrong item. The item I received even looks different than the picture shown in the ad."
2,Looked more like silver than chrome,"As another reviewer said, it looked silver and not chrome.(I submitted this review once a few days ago but Amazon chose not to publish it so I re-submit the review)"
2,It works,This item is not the bright chrome color I thought I was ordering it more like a steel color and I was looking for chrome like you see on a rim of a model car?
5,"Insight to the book & movie ""Serving in Silence""",I felt this book was well written & should show people who hate homosexuals that their lives together are very loving. I especially appreciate Ms. Cammermeyer for sticking up for her beliefs. How can society bad-mouth anyone who has accomplished what all this woman did serving our country & being there for all who were physically unable to feign for themselves! I firmly believe that Miss Cammemeyer & her partner are an inspiration to all gay people & should change the minds of those against homosexuals.
5,Excellent,"Clearly reveals the absurd and cruel policy of the militaryconcerning lesbians and gays. How disgusting that an institutionof the U.S. government shows such bigotry, ignorance, anddistain for a group of people, not to mention an individualwho served her country with dedication and distinction. Howdisgusting the bigotry continues in the military andthroughout our government."
4,This book will keep your kids busy,"Few of the many things kids can do includes:Learn CPRMake a CollageLearn encyclopedia skillsMake your own personal flagRead about Canada, the 2nd largest country in the worldCreate a pet scrapbook or photo albumMake a salad with 5 ingredientsFind Out about a career you might like to haveFind a great pizza recipeMake lunch for your brother or sisterCard GamesAlso included in this book is a partial list of materials/supplies you will need to accomplish an activity"
2,"Once Miraculous, new formula no longer is.","I used to swear by this product. We had a kitten who had out-of-the-box issues, and we'd use this and the urine smell would disappear.Well, the last bottle I bought was extremely unimpressive! I did some digging online and discovered that in 2003, Nature's Miracle decided to end their relationship with the company who created the enzyme mixture.I guess they figured that they had so much word of mouth about how wonderful their product was that they could just sell us the name and not the actual Miracle!So: IT used to work. Old formula would have been a 5-star review, it doesn't do nearly as well anymore. The creators of the enzymes say they're selling the original formula under the name Petastic, and I'm going to check them out."
1,NO SMELL REMOVER,This product did NOT take away the smell of urine at all!!! I spent 4 hours trying to remove the urine smell from my carpet due to my puppy's accident and the odor is still there. I used the whole $12 bottle!!!!
1,"Use as directed, repeatedly, and be prepared for minimal results.","We have a little terrier who made a mess on a couch cushion. We used Nature's Miracle as directed, but ended up repeating the process three times and using an entire bottle on one application. Worse, the odor remained, and did little to remove the stain on a fabric type that the label says should match the product.We paid a lot of money for a lot of product for little results, when the best odor removal came from a $1.00 bottle of hydrogen peroxide from the corner drugstore. I'm never wasting my money on this one again."
5,not just for pet stains!,"I used this product once when my dog was sprayed by a skunk and it worked really well, but get this. One day my toddler son grabbed my glass of red wine off the table, and managed to dump it all over the light colored carpet before I could stop him. I was completely out of my regular carpet stain remover and Nature's Miracle was all I had on hand, so I dumped it on the wine stains and let it sit for about 10 minutes (directions say 5), then wiped it up with a damp cloth. I could not believe it took out that wine! I am a true fan of this stuff and will always keep a gallon on hand for those unfortunate kid and dog accidents."
3,Mouse Urine,Trying to get mouse order out of an old car carpet and padding... I've used a gallon so far with not very good results. Directions say drench the affected area... to do that I would need several more gallons. At this point I'm thinking new carpet. I think it would be a good product to use for spot treatment... not so much for a large area.
3,Not such an accurate Miracle,"I used this product as recommended and it did work on a single item, but in a load of wash it did not work very well at all. Maybe I didn't use it properly, but I find it too expensive to buy every week."
1,nature's miracle doesn't work,This stuff doesn't work. I used this product for about a month and had to clean my carpets with a product from a local store to take out the spots that this product left. I will never buy this product again and I will not recommend this product.
5,Indispensible Nature's Miracle,Nature's Miracle is an absolute necessity in my house. It removes ALL odors not just pet fumes.
1,Natures Miracle 1.5 gal. sprayer attachment needs one(miracle),"Natures Miracle needs to take their sprayer attachment back to the drawing board. What a piece of garbage. I've had three now and each time the sprayer works for one or two min. then stops pumping the fluid thru the tubing. Even trying to remove the screws to investigate the problem is a failure because you can't back out whatever type of chincy screw they used to put it together with. Batteries had plenty of power, but it would not pump out the fluid. Followed instructions as directed. Has anyone had any better luck with the sprayer attachment? Each time I purchased a new bottle I was hoping the old bottle had a simple malfunction but I'm convinced after three attempts and three failures the sprayer is garbage.They should stick their sprayer in a better spot than sticking it to the consumer."
5,Truly a miracle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Any home with a pet, should have Nature's Miracle!!!!!!!!!!!We pour our gallon of Nature's Miracle into a large garden sprayer. The nozzel can be adjusted for heavy saturation needs to slight spray for little drips.Save money by using a black light to only spray where needed.Potty training a new puppy wasn't nearly as bad with Nature's Miracle on hand!!!!!!!!We turned our neighbor onto this product. She has cats that were peeing under her oxygen generator. The generator was heating the pee as they pee'd. The smell was toxic!!! The smell knocked you out when you walked in the door! She poured an entire gallon of Nature's Miracle on the area. After it dried, their was a slight hint of pee, so she repeated the process. Amazingly the smell was gone. All I can say is, if this product isn't working in your house, you are not following directions and are using it to sparingly!"
3,Great for stains but not so good on odor,"I admit that this product is amazing for stains. The patches of carpet I used it on are now much cleaner than the surrounding areas. the one peeve that I have is that it does not get the urine odor out unless you totally saturate the carpet and the underlying pad (especially since my dog pees like he had just been on a beer binge during Oktoberfest). This makes absolute sense, but I end up using a LOT of the solution. One spray bottle worth only lasts me 3 pee-pee stains. Very low PPG (pee per gallon) in my book. I have had much more success with Odorzout which is a granule that wicks up all of the moisture, can be vacuumed up, and eliminates odors. All this with a lot more product to spare."
3,works most of the time,If you get to the stain right away it works well. If it is an older stain.. I haven't has as much success. Still have a colored stain just lighter..
2,not a fan,"I'm not going to write a long review, I had a roommate who ignored my ""no pet policy"" I then tried several methods of removing the cat urine smell this product did not eliminate the odor nor did any other method. The carpet and padding will have to be replaced. This product may work on smaller areas for spot cleaning but he literally let the cat use the floor as a liter box and Natures Miracle did not peform said miracle."
3,Works great,"I used this one, in the gallon, titled Just for Cats. It worked to my relief. I saturated the areas completely and ended up using the entire gallon. One area cleared the smell (I had no stains) completely. The other is a much bigger and wider spot so I am going to use it again. I used another product that only made it worse. This product took care of the smell 100%. I cannot vouch for the stain because I didn't have any stains to get rid of. I also didn't wipe it up or pat a towel down. I poured and then placed a small fan all day. The next morning, the smell was gone. Three stars only because it took 1/2 of the spots I treated."
2,Does not remove stain under blacklight!,"I bought this to remove the protein stains left by dog/cat urine in carpet. I had already sufficiently removed the color and smell of the stain. However, under blacklight the stain remained. Thus, in an effort to fully remove this I purchased 2 gallons of this stuff. It was a waste of my money. I used it as directed initially then tried different application procedures. Nothing worked. If you need to remove the stain from a black light inspection - save your time and money - avoid this product."
5,Old school metal in the 21st century,"Nice to hear old school metal in a fresh format. This album rocks! If you like Dio, Priest, Sabbath, etc, you'll like this album. No hair bands here, just straight-up metal. My personal favs on this album: It flies again, Sundown, In the end, and Under the Thunder. Note, the 2nd CD listed on this page is a mix CD with multiple bands on the Liquor and Poker label. Nice mix with bands I've never heard of other than Fireball Ministry, nice addition to the CD purchase. I agree, probably Top 5 best metal albums of 2005/2006. BTW - Saw them open for Dio a few years back, kicka-- show."
2,Their Rock Does Not Rock,"I really liked this band after picking up Second Great Awakening. This is like SGA on Prozac. The songs sound almost identical to SGA but they don't go anywhere and drag and drag. I've tried with this CD but end up yanking it out after the third song or so in frustration. Some of it is just painful. Whoever produced this album let the band sleep walk through the recording. Literally, it sounds like the band is sleepy. If you haven't heard Second Great Awakening, please do, and this album will pale in comparison."
3,Sabbath-lite,"Lots of SABBATH worship here - bluesy, swaggering 70s rock with thick, crunchy riffs, and a singer who sounds a hell of a lot like Ozzy at times. Nothing that references some of Sabbath's more expansive, progressive tracks, though - these are all more compact, straightforward pieces. It'd be nice to see them stretch a bit more."
4,Diverse perspectives from sheikhs to Saadawi,"While at first put off by the apparent lumping of an entire religion by an albeit growing minority of extremists, Goodwin's premise that women living in Islamic countries are being denied rights owed to them by the religion they follow is solid. The book is at its best when she lets the people she's interviewing tell the story. Contrasting the perspectives of the Muslim Sisterhood leader Ghazzali with feminst Saadawi in the final chapter on Egypt, Goodwin explains the bigger picture of how separating women is a political maneuver by men trying to establish their authority over corrupt governments. While this book is over 5 years old,based on whats being reported in Afganistan- the reality appears the same. I liked the country by country breakdowns, but would have preferred a bibliography."
3,Exaggerations,I don't know why these western women are trying to give a sterotypical view to all non-muslims. Well I am sorry to say that I am a Muslim and live in a Muslim country but I have not yet gone through all those atrocities described by the author. Islam is a great religion and if anyone wants to study it they should do so on their own and not get their ideas from these books. Just because I choose to have respect for myself and not prance around naked like a bimbo doesn't mean that I'm not a liberal woman. Please! Gimme a break!
4,A good introduction to women living under fundamentalism,"Although Goodwin tries to be objective, she still demontrates a slight tendency to condemn Islam and Muslims. However, in spite of a few minor inaccuracies, she does present a fairly valid picture of women living in Islamic fundamentalist societies. To her credit, she repeatedly makes the point that none of these atrocities are based on the Qu'ran, but are instead a product of patriarchical society. She presents the women she interviews in a sympathetic light and lets them tell their stories from their own perspectives. These women will stay in your memory."
4,erudite and very thorough,"I was consistently impressed with how much information Goodwin managed to cram into each chapter. She is meticulous in documenting each topic she pursues and it is obvious that she has great interest in what she writes about. Though it would have been nice to read about a more representative sample of subjects, Goodwin has done very well with the resources given her. Anyone interested in women in the Middle East would gain a great deal from this book because of its deep yet broad scope."
1,Just another book for fast money.,"Having read the part on the United Arab Emirates (Since I'm from there) The writer starts his writing with discribing how the city looks, which is true, then adds in some lies from here and there (as spices) claims to have interviewed a few working females, then shows their stories as if it's what goes on with everyone. Which isn't true. You can't believe everything you hear or read, you have to be there to see it yourself."
1,Silly Silly Silly,"What a silly thing to believe this type of writing. It is amazing how writers will make the people that are looking for horrible things to actually believe them, but that's the key isn't it? This book will gratify the kinds of people that WANT to think these things are true. If you want to read the truth about Islam and the lifestyle then maybe you should write one of the embassies and get REAL information. I called the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C. and they were gracious to send dozens of pamphlets, brochures etc. that tell the truth. If you want the truth, go find it...but you won't find it here in these silly, silly, silly, writer's imaginations. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha. We are all laughing at this nonsense and none of us thought it was even that well written."
3,Too small and don't wash well,"I agree with others that these are too small for swaddling. The other problem is that after the first washing they look like they've been washed 100 times. They get little ""pulls"" all over and look horrible."
3,Poor Quality,"After the first washing, two of the five blankets fell apart. I registered and received both the blue and green receiving blankets and returned them both. I originally chose these because the patterns were so cute but the poor quality isn't worth keeping them. I wouldn't buy them."
3,"ave. quality, not for swaddling","My baby came out 10lbs so by the 2nd week, his feet came out the blankets and I could no longer swaddle him. So I went back bought the 2- 3 pack 40""x30"" blankets since they were the biggest available. One was Koala blankets which were cheaper than the Carter one. The colors of the Koala blankets were much better than the Carter ones but the Carter blankets were a little bit thicker. Both brand can swaddle my big baby.As for these blankets, well I used them for burp cloth, to cover the car seat etc. They are still useful but the quality isn't as great. After 10 washes in a month, a few blankets are showing signs of falling apart already. Luckily I bought triple amount of blankets that the new born list recommended."
2,Cute pattern/smaller than stated,"I chose these blankets for the very cute pattern assortment to make a cover for my changing table pad. When I openned the package at home I discovered that while they are supposed to be 30""x30"" they are really smaller than that. Too small to use for my intended purpose. I have not washed them yet so I don't know if they shrink or how they hold up. They seem a little thinner than other receiving blankets that I have used with my 3 older children.Here I am 1 year later. The blankets have held up in the wash very well and become softer with each washing. Although I did not use them for swaddling, I used a similar set of flannel blankets. The thinness that I complained about actually is a benefit when you are swaddling a baby in hotter weather. A too thick blanket leaves you with a hot and sweaty baby. I didn't swaddle my older kids (it wasn't in vogue 12 years ago), so I didn't know. The only way we got this one to sleep was to swaddle him very tightly."
2,The Chaplin Slowdown,"Compiled, scored and narrated by Charlie Chaplin in 1958, ""The Chaplin Revue"" was a terrific idea to showcase three of the comedian's best films for First National: ""A Dog's Life"" (1918), ""Shoulder Arms"" (1918) and ""The Pilgrim"" (1923). Unfortunately, Chaplin tampered with these particular films by presenting them at a slower projection speed, which ruins the original comic timing and pacing. As a public service, avoid ""The Chaplin Revue"" and locate the out-of-print ""First National Collection"" on DVD. This excellent disc includes most of Chaplin's 1918-23 work at the proper projection speed. The difference is amazing."
5,The best notebook mouse I've found,"I don't know what was wrong with Hal's mouse, but I couldn't disagree more about the SI750m.After going through 3 other mice that died long before their time and were a pain in many other ways (see Sexless in Seattle's excellent review), I got this one at Amazon, mostly because it was fairly inexpensive. I've had it a year now and I LOVE it. I'm here looking for another SI750 for another laptop I bought for my wife. I passed over Logitech and Microsoft mice, though cheaper, because those are the ones that died on me before and were such pains. I'd rather pay a little more for this one, knowing it performs faultlessly and won't suddenly crap out.You won't go wrong with this mouse."
4,Can you follow instructions?,"If you can this unit is quite simple to put together, but if you have trouble building things this can be daunting. Once together its easy to move and use. Make sure you fill it with water or sand. I prefer sand as it won't get stagnant like water. The only big drawback was the net could not be lowered as much as I had hoped. I have 3 boys all under 9 and the minimum height is about 6 1/2 feet. On the bright side, they will still be using it many years from now!"
3,It's cheap built!! Do not buy it.,I don't like it at all. It's cheap built and impossible to make it stable no matter how heavy the base is because the connection with the base is not stable. I wish I could return it to amazon after assembled it.
4,My son loves his hoop,"Bought it for my son for christmas, got it for a really good price, received it like 2 weeks earlier then I espected thats awsome. My husband and son built it had no problems, took maybe a hour or a little longer to build, but not bad my son always plays with the hoop when it is nice out.... I recommend this product"
2,Hard to put together,This product was very hard to assemble. We had to contact the manufacturer to help assemble it. It was purchased for Christmas and it took several days to get this thing assembled.[...]
3,"Nice product, horrible set-up",We like the basketball set however it was thee worst thing ever to put together! It is very difficult! So much that I considered divorce twice during the 2hr process with my husband!
3,Price difference,"I reviewed this item last week and it was listed at $100...After Thanksgiving, the price has increased to $114. Why?"
1,Big Dissapoinment,Bought this for my grandsons'birthday........3 parts missing (Axles) essential for putting this together!Needless to say BIG dissapointment!!!
5,IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!,"Wow, I'm glad I didn't base my decision to buy this basketball goal based on the other guy's review. I researched this item through several other websites and found it to be a genuinely good quality item at a fantastic sale price! I bought this for my 2 sons and they love it. Mu husband put the whole thing together in about 30 - 45 minutes and all the parts were there and they all fit perfectly. In less than an hour after opening the box, my kid's were shooting hoops happily and two weeks later, they are still shooting and still happy. Way to go Amazon and Lifetime!!!!!"
5,Great product,"After reading several HORRIBLE reviews on other name brands, I went with a Lifetime product simply because there hadn't been any bad reviews on a Lifetime product. This goal is great! It set up quickly and there were no missing parts. The kids were playing ball an hour later. I would highly recommend this product! And, it was only $100 including tax and shipping! WOW!"
4,Nice Goal - Had Trouble on the Build,"Once I could get it together, it's a nice goal - my son loves it.It was missing two braces from the factory. They do have nice customer service, and did reply to my email regarding this within two hours. The only problem was: the parts were shipped USPS and took two weeks to arrive - my son drove me nuts until I could get it done.enough said - reason for 4 instead of 5."
2,cheep,"the backboard is warped from the start. the rim doesn't bolt up evenly, to make a true 90degree with the backboard. Ok for starters but don't have high expectations. For the money,... It's ok."
2,Cheap box,"The item arrived promptly, sent in the factory carton, which was a thin, cheap quality cardboard that ripped open in transit and some of the pieces were missing!"
3,Not a happy camper,"I bought this system about 2 months ago, and it really sucks. Not even worth the $100 I paid for it. I guess I got what I payed for. The back board was not stable. Everytime i go for a lay up or shoot a bank shot the back board tilts to one side. Although this does not effect the shot much, it's just not sturdy enough to handle the years of use that i expected to get from it. I will not buy this merchandise in the future. I would recommend buying a heavy-duty system that will assure you of years of basketball pleasure."
3,Good product...bad Amazon!,"Got this for our sons for Chrsitmas. Decided to wait and assemble the night before, so they'd be surprised. Unfortunately, Amazon had shipped us someone else's return -- so it was missing several items. Contacted customer service. No help. Luckily, when we called Lifetime directly, they FedExed the missing parts. Amazon does not check returns before re-shipping! Buyer beware!"
3,cheaper on Lifetime's web site,You can get a bigger backboard lifetime portable hoop on Lifetime's Web site for the same price plus free shipping.
4,Sometimes the truth can hurt...,"Jake just can't do anything right. He splits up with Zoey, the girl he loves, because she's in love with his worst enemy, Lucas. But is Lucas really guilty? Jake gets hurts again as his new girlfriend Claire makes the choice between right and wrong. Just like the others in this fabulous series, this is an excellent book and literally had me guessing till the last page. Brilliant!"
5,Pakelika for President,"I have heard a lot of bad reviews about this cd, but i want to put to rest that this cd is just what the tilte says a cult classic. It is so deep that it takes major intelligence to desipher and understand paks unusual, but very deliberate and skilled lyrical talent. He is a true lyrasist who is not affraid to tackle very deep subjects, and brilliantly places his words so that sentances can be taken many different ways, and you are not quite sure when one starts or stops. Very advanced, hard to swallow for people used to mass marketed hip-hop. The beats are hot, the flows are out of this world, you can listen to the cd start to finish without skipping a song. If you are a true lover of marijuana, freedom, and revolution BUY THIS ALBUM"
1,Where's my album?!?,This is the worst thing i have heard since Kelly Osbourne trying to sing Papa Don't Preach! I know I can make an album better than this. Where is my millions of dollars I should be making? I love the Kottonmouth Kings but this album was a bad idea. Sorry Pak but next time keep your mouth shut!
1,what is this?,"i'm a big fan of kmk and all the other subnoize artists, but i really don't know what to say about this album. i bought it right when it came out and only listened to it once. maybe i just dont understand pak, but he should just stick to dancing on stage and waving those signs with crazy s**t on them. this is probably the only subnoize album that i don't like. but i kept it anyway just cause he is associated with kmk."
1,"uh, not that good","I've been a Sub-noize supporter for a while, and they haven't disappointed me in the past with classics like the KMK cd's, Too Rude, and Bobby B to name a few. However, this offering from Pakelika does not come close to the high level of quality I expected. Actually, I'd say Pak's flow on this cd is beyond weak and beats from Bobby B, or whoever, cannot salvage this project. Do not buy this cd if you like rappers who can flow, or have dope voices. Pakelika is NOT tight on the mic. Avoid this."
4,Misunderstood,"Pakelika is an amazing lyrcist that just has a very different flow type, once you get an ear for it you will really come off the experience with a new way to look at flow structure and beat play."
3,"Contains decent information, but is ridiculously overpriced.","The size of this book is 7 inches by 5 inches, and it is half an inch wide. It maxes out at 206 pages. It has no color pictures -- no pictures at all, for that matter. It's also a paperback. Why is this book $30?Outside of being unbelievably overpriced, it does offer good information on how to conduct interviews. It is one of the better journalism textbooks I've encountered as a student, but still, it's not horribly novel.If you want a handy interviewing guide to keep in your pocket, or a lightweight bookbag, it's a good buy. If you want value for your money, bum it off a classmate who has parents that pay for their books."
2,quite dissapointing,"reading the book description and being a fan of historical fiction, i had expecting a treat, but was sorely dissapointed. this is not anywhere close to patrick o'brian, it's humourless, flat, does not provide enough background into the times it depicts."
2,A crashing bore,"I had to struggle to finish this book. Its characters are uninteresting and poorly developed. It lacks humor, historical context, and credibility. The author does little more than string together a number of nautical incidents that he collected in his research. My reading group actively disliked the book, and only one member gave it as much as a 6 out of 10."
4,A great first book,"Although, I can't say that I couldn't put it down it did hold my interest. I look forward to more historical adventures by the author. If you liked this you may want to try Birds of Prey or Monsoon by Wilbur Smith"
4,High seas adventure,"This is an adventure story formed around the goals of the pirate Bartholomew Roberts, or Black Bart as he has been known.Nicholas Griffin writes very well, and this is his first published book. I will read his next book also. The glossary in the back is very helpful, but I wish it had been more extensive. Also, in the paperback, the printing on the map is too small to read.It did seem odd to me that an educated person like William Williams found himself among such cutthroats. Why was he there, and why did he stay in the face of the horrors they committed?If you like boats, adventure, pirates, this is a good book to read.And, it's a good time to read this book and contrast it with the summer's movie from Disney, Pirates of the Caribbean."
4,"Good read ahoy, mates!","This is an excellent book! It's a little hard to get into at first due to the fact that the author uses authentic language of the times, but once the reader becomes used to the language, it is dark, yet moving. The character of Bartholomew Roberts is richly drawn - his brutality, his struggles as captain, his personal struggles, his loneliness, his motives - he is like a hero of mythology - tragically flawed, yet great and above most men. It was a book I read several times. The brutality of the slave trade and the times, and the startling lapses into kindness, are well drawn, and keep the reader alert. The author explores rich emotions in response to circumstances. He has also very carefully researched the history, adding authenticity. I would highly recommend this book. My only complaint is that there is way too much spitting in the story!"
3,Not bad for the price,"I have owned this lamp for 4 years now and yes, while the reflector is not great and it is a bit shadowy, I can still read the knobs, set list, or anything else i need to see. This lamp has lived in my Front of House bag of goodies for years and other than a new lamp here and there (I buy the Littlite halogens) this gooseneck has been great. I also like that it is removable from the base. So if you have a BNC lamp attachment on the board, you can use it instead of the base. Is it a Littlite, no. I still like Littlite for the reflector quality and the filters that you can buy with it, but, for the money it's a good little gooseneck."
1,The New Internet Business Book,"If you are reading this and it is the year 2000, save your money, well outdated material, unless you want to have your business 10 years behind in time. If you are really serious about E-business you aren't going to get the information that you are looking for here. Hire a Consultant look professional, or be the total opposite and follow the advise from this book."
2,"Too focused on small business, outdated technology","The book was quite comprehensive in its approach; however, it was written for the first homesteaders on the Internet, circa 1995. The focus is on small businesses putting brochureware online and addresses such non-relevant media as gopher and ftp. Was probably a great resource back in the day, but examples it offers are now quaint. Does not provide keys for competing in Internet time."
4,Something you can feel,"I'm a huge Chic fan so I was getting around to filling out my catalog with this cd. I listened to the album once and I wasn't crazy about. I went ahead and bought it anyways and have been *very* happy since. If you are throwing a party this will play nicely; I'm confident someone will ask who is on the stereo. Track 4 is great but my favorite is track 6. ""In it to win it"" is really good too. If you are a Chic lover get this cd."
2,"Nothing to listen to here, folks","As much as I love Chic and think Nile Rodgers is a musical genius, I don't think one must expect much of this record. I had no idea of what was going to be found here, but essentially what you get here is a lot of generic dance music, and good luck if you can distinguish one song from another. Gets tiresome after about 20 minutes, and let us face it: there is no Chic without Tony Thompson, the original ladies and keyboardist-violinists from the 70's. Drums here sound like banging on a cereal box, and the singers...well, listen to the demo available in Amazon for this record, maybe you can save some bucks. My respects to Nile Rodgers, but there are some times when you must know when to lay to rest a good band's name, and start another if you want to keep making music. But if you expect Chic quality and grooves, you won't find them here, folks. Sorry for this review, but this is nothing special, really."
3,Why Chic Fell Off,"this album illustrates what went wrong with chic. they just couldn't find any way to escape their groove, and they lost their quirk. i loved 'take it off', but this album just sounds old.buy it if you must. it *is* chic after all. there's some decent stuff to sample if you're working some mixes, but other than that, you won't want to listen to it often."
1,Didn't help at all,"This video was terrible. It doesn't have set up routines it just goes from 1 workout to the next and shows you how each gets harder and then that's it. No routine nothing you could really do on a daily basis. I ended up throwing it out and getting a yoga video. I mean even if it went through with all the workouts then maybe it would've been ok but no. it stopped talked to you a while pointing out the same things it did with all the other work outs and then you'd do the exercise and then stop and talk and then exercise and on it went. I just wouldn't recommend it, there are to many better videos out there.Like the yoga for beginners that was actually quite useful.Yoga For Beginners"
1,Currency?,"If this is supposed to have a $300 value as the ""new"" generation of non-federal reserve backed currency, then why can I buy it for less than $300? Doesn't that defeat the purpouse of the dollar for dollar exchange rate of currency that liberty dollar proclaims? I thought that having your money backed by precious metals was supposed to keep it at a stable value, or at least that's what I read at the liberty dollar website.I'm just sayin'"
4,Casa de Los Babys,"I found this movie to be very touching and real. It isn't John Sayles best movie, but we've come to expect something totally stunning from him every time. It is however very much worth seeing. It gives a very gritty feeling of being in Mexico waiting to adopt a baby. The women who play the main characters do great acting. They play a cross section of very genuine personality types. No plot, just the drama of daily life in an emotionally volatile situation. Brings up all sides of the issue of adopting babies in foreign countries, including a very moving portrayal of the life of homeless street children."
2,All-star casts gets little to work with,"Dynamite casts slowly falls into the oblivion of the script. Not sure what the point of this movie was, as their is no higher moral point conveyed than maybe a couple should adopt a street orphan over a newborn.Ending is a total disaster. Most characters are stereotypes with ZERO character development. Finally, I have no idea where the setting is.Extremely poor offering from Sayles."
1,"Long, Boring and Pointless","This movie was quite long, and went nowhere. It is about six ladies who go to South America to adopt babies. The people in South America are giving these ladies a hard time and trying to get more money out of the Americans. The ladies wait a long time to get a baby...this is all that happens in two hours. It was boring, predictable, and boring. The movie ended and nothing happened. Don't waste your time"
4,good deal,i didnt buy this from amazon but i got it in an electronics shop this is a very good maodel mp3 water proof good lock 30 stationery memorys sounds extra base great headphones but the problem with this that instead of saying the name of the song it says the song number which is not useful if you have 300 songs for you wont remember the song also this doesnt have input or out put thats why its four stars i also think that you cant get the last song im not sure cause i have had this item for 2 days there is another mp3 cheaper that says the name and has input out put but i liked how this one looked
4,yes it's trance.....but,"Don't get me wrong, this _is_ a trace CD. What Razed in Black has done is darken it up a fair bit and that is a GoodThing(tm). I mostly spin electro-industrial and futurepop so a lot of this stuff won't be immediately useful in one of my sets. On it's own it's a pretty damn good set to put on to listen to. Some of the transitions could have been managed better but there are quite a few that blend seamlessly. It's usually on rotation in my car or at my workstation at work."
4,A wonderful reference,"I first turned to this book on the ""bargains"" table at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and I certainly got my money's worth! I've used the numerous images (particularly those featuring women and their interaction with medicine throughout art history) in women's studies class and the articles are excellent as well. Editors Carmichael and Ratzan have collected primary documents from the ancient world to modern medicine and I enjoy their blend of medical treatise, social letters, and poetry of each period. A wonderful gift for anyone with medicine or art as an interest."
5,THE LIVING TREE -CD/DVD,"This CD IS THE BEST I HAVE HEARD IN YEARS !!!! SHE IS IN TOP FORM !!!!!However, I can't get the DVD to play ?? Any suggestions from previous reviewers or present owners ?"
4,Peachy keen!,"Get the Party Started is a treat and ""The Living Tree"" is so perfect for Dame Shirley Bassey's voice that she ought never let those ""Rock Chicks"" (Never the Bride) out of her sight again! Awesome stuff....."
1,It did not reach my expectations,It sounded like such a good book when they advertised it and I was let down. I thought it would be a lot better. I was very disapointed
2,Never Call Retreat,"I have witheld my thoughts on this series until this book in order to better review all three books. My final analyse is that if you look at the series as only a work of fiction it might be an interesting read but since it uses actual historical events and portends to assume they way actual people (ie Grant and Lee) would have acted if the situation had been different, in my opinion its pure rubbish. The first book about Gettysburg is easily the best of the three since it is closer to the actual events and follows a course of action the participants did consider. The second and third books arer pure fiction and should be considered in that light. I think that all three books are weak in the sense they show a poor understanding of the mindset of both Grant and Lee. I feel as if I understand both men well enough to know that the scenario as protrayed in the books would never have unfolded the way it was presented."
1,What a Ripoff,"Newt and William are going to write a new book. It will be called an Alternate History of World War II. In it Germany will win the Battle of the Bulge BUT lose the war. Their next book will be an Alternate History of the Revolutionary War, in it the Colonies will win. Then they will together write an Alternate History of the First World War. In this stirring book, the ALLIES WIN, THE ALLIES WIN. What is the point? Also read Sidewalk Sam below for a fuller explanation of this lousy book."
3,Entertaining but very disappointing,"I read all three in this series of ""Alternative History"" and found the first two fascinating reading and all three were page turners. The last, however left me with more issues that I could not resolve. The end result was as expected. Lee surrenders. I could accept all of the alternative presentations and battles but I could not accept George Armstrong Custer being killed in a battle. What will happen at the ""Little Big Horn""?"
5,the final chapter,"outstanding ending to the ""what if"" in the war of northern aggression. there should be a book four, from the start of the war."
5,Hightlighting Honor,"This book provides a solid, fast-paced read through subjects ranging from war as slaughter, the struggles of military leaders of the time with loss of life, the horrors of 19th Century battlefield medicine, and most of all, the tragedy of war fought between those who had no business fighting each other. The role of African-Americans is used in a realistic and dignified manner - if only this fiction had translated to fact in the mid 1800s we could have moved race relations ahead faster.But the underlying theme has to be honor - the honor in battle, and the honor in dealing with victory and defeat to achieve the higher purpose of keeping a nation together. Should be required reading for members of our governing bodies and agencies which too often sell out honor for expediency.The characterizations are strong and the story entirely plausible, making the book a page turner with meaning. Clearly a book for any history student, and particularly any Civil War buff."
2,never call retreat,"the actual audio container was in poor condition but the cds were fine. as for the cd content, i have enjoyed this tape."
3,Entertaining but very disappointing,"A review by Anthony T. Riggio of Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory (Hardcover) I read all three in this series of ""Alternative History"" and found the first two fascinating reading and all three were page turners. The last, however left me with more issues that I could not resolve. The end result was as expected. Lee surrenders. I could accept all of the alternative presentations and battles but I could not accept George Armstrong Custer being killed in a battle. What will happen at the ""Little Big Horn""?"
5,Great Hair,I swear by this product. I had to give it a little time but now my hair is so much healthier. It is stronger and thicker. My hairstylist noticed and commented on the improvement in the quality of my hair.
3,ok,I didn't see much results with this product. I used it for about 4 months. I can only say that my nails became stronger. Would purchase again.
1,"Did not help me at all, but people are different","I tried Ultra Hair Plus and it stop my hair loss and started to grow a little bit more hair, but it was a little pricey. So, I switch to GREAT HAIR hoping that they would do the same thing. You get more pills for the same price. I was hoping that the pills has the same Supplements and did the same thing. I took it for two months and my hair started to fall back out. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,cheap,"although i did really like these earrings, they were very cheap and the back post broke off after only 5 wears...i was very disappointed"
3,Alright quality.,The quality of the earrings was alright. It looked a bit cheap which might explain the price but they looked okay. They shipped very quickly and in great condition.
1,just awful,This was so bad I sent it back. The content is old stag films (perhaps in 8 mm) of girls with hooters getting laid. The production values couldn't be worse.
1,Buy this book with caution.,Consider this book more of a reference source of the hundreds of cookbooks that are currently on the market. It's hard to take the authors' recommendations seriously when they also endorse their own cookbooks!
1,More sales pitch than serious analysis,This book is heavily slanted towards books that appeared in the last year or so. Some haven't even been published yet--which makes me suspect that one of the authors is plugging books which s/he edited and will profit by.Most of the information in this book can be gleaned for free from catalogs like *Jessica's Biscuit.* What's most disappointing about it is the bland prose and uninspired selections. I had hoped to learn about unknown gems or at least find new appreciation for some of my own favorites. No such luck with this p.r. approach to cook book criticism.
5,Blessed Baby,"After reading this touching, funny and extremely well written journey of the 9 LONG months of carrying a human being, I found myself smiling, crying and joyful at the triumphant victory of both parents and the baby.This is one blessed baby to be so loved and treasured. A moving and honest book of unconditional love."
2,Too broken,"I LOVED Otherwise Engaged...nay, I adored it. I've lent my copy to all my friends in town, and bought extra copies for my out-of-town friends. This book though, was not the same. I still like this author, and will continue to read her work, but I was a bit let down by this piece. Granted, I was expecting a lot, because I just had my first baby at a later age, and was hoping to identify with this character. However, the language was so broken that I had a hard time finding a flow. Two and three word sentences I found grating after awhile."
4,"Great, if short, book","I will echo another reviewer's comments and mention that the copyright page says ""fiction,"" but this is clearly a memoir. This is the story of a woman who is pregnant, told to her unborn child. The child's name is Pablo Finnamore Friedman.Along the way, the author advises the baby on how to treat women, fills him in on family history, and memorializes her eating habits - carrot cake, Stouffer's macaroni and cheese, the saltier and fattier, the better. On a more serious note she talks about how pregnancy purges her of cynicism, makes her feel new and childlike again.Finnamore is a very funny, talented writer who doesn't shy away from awkward truths. Recommended."
5,All too true!,"I loved Otherwise Engaged (the audiotape with Linda Hamilton reading is worth hearing, even if you've read the book). The Zygote Chronicles is equally funny but the biting wit is tempered by the growing sense of falling totally absolutely in love with this little person she's yet to meet. Ties with my long-term favorite on mothering by Anne Lamott, Operating Instructions. If you're a mom (particularly a 35+ mom) with a sense of humor about the ridiculous expectations of the classic (and useful) ""What to Expect"" series, you'll appreciate these books. If you're not a mother yet, you may get a kick out of the humor (I'm an advertising agency owner so the career sections were hysterical for me).If you're enaged, married, thinking you might someday marry, read her first book, Otherwise Engaged."
4,The Zygote Chronicles,"A cute book to read if you are pregnant, have been pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. I would, however, have liked more pregnancy details, etc. Still a cute enough read nonetheless."
5,"fabulous book, a memoir not a novel!","As the reviewer for Publisher's Weekly notes above, this book reads like a memoir, not a novel. The established format of a pregnancy journal proceeding month by month is skillfully utilized by Finnamore who manages to combine insightful social commentary on the plight of the pregnant working woman with personal, anecdotal experiences that ring true. Furthermore, Finnamore does not shy away from exploring women's mixed feelings about pregnancy. Zygot Chronicles rates right up there with Operating Intruction by Annie Lamott, a hilarious and honest look at the first year of parenthood."
5,Good product & seller!,Quality product! Very fast & prompt response from seller even changing shipping address after order placement.Will definitely buy again.
1,"Disappointing, poor quality","Does the job but very fragile, the 3.5MM end of the cable broke when I unplugged it, only 2 months after the purchase"
1,This jack doesn't do jack on my Mac,"Bought this to connect a Zero DAC to my iMac via digital output port for 24-bit music enjoyment. Yeah, but no sound at all. Oops. In Preferences, Sound, the Mac recognizes the connection with this cable (says ""Digital Out"" and ""Built-in Output"") but when I select it, sound cuts out completely.Guess it's back to the 16-bit USB connection . . ."
1,Plastic sheath on 3.5mm jack side broke after removing cable from jack.,"This cable is worthless. When I first got it, I put it in my laptop's combined 3.5mm analog/optical output jack, and it seemed to work great. Unfortunately, however, when I removed the cable, the plastic sheathing broke and remained inside of the jack. The product is covered by a lifetime warranty, however, considering that this failed less than an hour after recieving it, I will simply buy a better quality cable. Buyer beware."
5,"Interesting, creative...and scary","I read this compelling book in 3 nights. The first series of dream quests were really creepy and scary. The author has some interesting, philosophical,and creative ideas about the nature of life and the world. About how we got here and WHERE WE ARE GOING and why the world is in such turmoil. It's a cross between religious philosophy and science fiction all in novel form, if you can imagine that. I guess we all have to go through hell to get to our own version of heaven. Very well written. I recommend it."
4,If only every city had a guidebook this good,"Compact, informative, and useful, with a good balance between tourist info and the kind of thing you'd want to know if you were moving to Boston. The Times reviewer who called it ""hip and culturally savvy"" may have been revealing his own squareness -- I wouldn't say there's much truly countercultural about this book -- but it does cover everything from used record stores to gay bars, so it's not entirely stodgy, either. The maps are great and the book is small enough to keep at hand while exploring. A good choice."
3,Good if you do not already have a jigsaw.,"I have only used this attachment once. It worked fine but when you attach it to the Dremel tool you end up with a tool that is quite high and a little awkward. If you plan to use this attachment a lot, you should first consider a full size jigsaw. Also, this attachment only works with the Dremel 400 XPR. I think you could buy a full size jigsaw for less than buying the 400 XPR with the MultiSaw attachment. However, Dremel makes a small planer for use with the 400 XPR that is quite handy. So, if you were going to buy a 400 XPR, the MultiSaw attachment and the planer would be reasonable additions. Also, I think Dremel made a mistake by making attachments that only work with one model of tools. By doing so, they are missing a big piece of their own market by not designing an attachment that will work with all of their tools. If this attachment worked on all of the Dremel tools I would have rated it with 4 stars."
4,Great product!,I used this attachment to cut the roof for an exhaust fan. It was definitely the only tool that would have worked! I was so happy I bought it the week before! Great for small/tight spaces! Definitely something everyone with a Dremel tool should have!
3,"For 400 XPR, 4000, and 8200 Rotary Tool ONLY","Nothing in the Amazon listing warned me of this.The box and front of the owner manual say ""For use with Dremel 400 Series XPR.""Page 5 of the manual says ""For use with Dremel 400 Series XPR Rotary tool only.""(Subsequent models 4000 and 8200 are also compatible.)Reviewer ""Osama I. J. Deir"" says it works with his Dremel 395 series tool, and I was able to attach and run it with mine. But 2 gray plastic tabs at the saw's connection point prevent it from seating well.Ironically, you could use your Dremel to grind off the tabs and get a better connection to your non-XPR Dremel tool.But I am returning my MultiSaw because Dremel is telling me in multiple ways that it's not a good idea. Maybe it's overload issue...who knows?Nice that Amazon returns are super easy."
1,Don't expect too much.,"I was very disappointed in this tool. I bought it to cut out a 12"" x 6"" panel in 1/4"" thick fiberglass with 1/16"" aluminum on one surface. Since it used standard jig saw blades, I figured it would be up to the task.The primary reason I used this item rather than a jig saw is that I had a restricted area where the jig saw would not fit.It made it about half way through the job when it quit working. When I disassembled it, I found it had nylon (or perhaps simply plastic) gears, which were rounded smooth. The manual does caution against running the tool too fast, and I did heed that, but its supposed to be able to cut through 1 1/2"" material, so I figured it should have worked for my application. But at any rate, for almost $30, it should have metal gears.Unless you are cutting thin or soft material, get something heftier, like a pneumatic saw."
2,Useless.,"I've tried using this saw on multiple occasions with multiple materials, and it's just useless. Originally, I thought it was my own fault, attempting to cut some pretty thick plywood. But I recently attempted to cut plywood that was maybe an 1/8"" thick and it took forever. I finally gave up and went to Lowes to buy a HAND coping saw, and it was much faster.I know it's less than $20 here, but I think you're better off getting a dedicated jigsaw."
2,Blind Sawing!,"I had hoped that the Dremel Multisaw would be a good alternative to a standard jigsaw for cutting thin and small stock, but this tool did not work out for me.The design of the Multisaw makes it impossible to see exactly where the blade is cutting. You must saw blind with only the faceplate score to guide the cut. In addition, the Dremel XPR with the saw attachment is tall and difficult to stabilize."
5,wolf talk,I loved it---you can almost understand what they are saying to each other--their silent thooughts and their enjoyment of life..What else could you want?????
1,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was looking forward to getting a product that resembles coffee but would be good for me. It does not resemble coffee at all. The taste is not enjoyable at all. I now mix it half and half with coffee and it is much better.Do not expect this product to taste like coffee,because it does not,Eleanor Potenza"
2,Not the best.,This video takes too much time outlining what they plan to teach and not enough time actually instructing.
3,Not what I had hoped,Easy to use and clean...great recipes included but I find that I never really get a product ready to eat out of the maker....I always have to freeze it. So no instant gratification! So honestly....wouldn't recommend it.
1,No Bats After 2 Years,"Well the bat house is very nice to look at, which is a good thing because it's only decorative at this point. After 2 years it's weathering to a greyish color and the lizards seem to like sunning on it. I followed all the instructions and I have seen bats in the area. They just don't like something about this house or the location."
3,as expected,"This was a good book of childrens stories, not often told in other story books. There are no pictures, though."
1,Blah,Was boring and couldn't even keep trying to read it. Not my taste of reading at all. I wouldn't recommend it!
3,Some weird stories,This book contained some strange stories and ideas but there were some cute ones as well. It wasn't good enough to read the whole thing to my son but I read him a couple of stories.
1,poor condition,the ball is harder than normal volleyballs but i was concerned that it was really dirty like it had been used or something!!
3,Interesting but a little boring,"This was fairly interesting, but didn't make a lot of sense at the end, actually, it was kinda' silly at the end. But if that's the Japanese legend, passed down through centuries, who am I to judge."
5,Great addition to our collection!,"My 3 year old loves every toy in this line! The pieces are sturdy, and the detail is impressive. We already have a few more sets lined up for her birthday in a few months. I would recommend this toy to any Mom who would like few hours of free time to herself! Fisher Price always comes up with winners!"
1,No Offense to the Junior High Music Club That Made This,"Wow, this is simply horrible. No tension, no dramatics, no alarms and no surprises. You'd think this concept would be delivered with some jazz hands, or at least some sort of unexpected style.Nope.Straight-Up piano lesson renditions. ""I can competently play this song on the piano...Let's cut an album!""It's pretty much your drunk uncle deciding he wants to tickle the ivories.Truly, that bad. Or worse."
2,Not even for die-hards,Nope. This one is not even for die-hard fans. First song or two I thought it was very interesting but it quickly turned bad. I had to force myself to listen to the album. U2 fans will be big time disappointed with this.
3,Triumphs sparingly,"3 1/2BOC are one of the few acts left in IDM still trying to make good the label, but even in an abundance of twiddles and tweaks the duo cannot escape their usual trappings of ultimately only having a few hauntingly esoteric programmings amidst too many interestingly shallow segues."
5,"Excelente Disco, Boards of Canada, siempre desparramando magia..!","Boards of canada tiene la particularidad de hacer de la musica pequeñas bellezas que quedaran inalterables al paso del tiempo.En este ultimo trabajo de la agrupación se mezclan texturas con raices mas folk, sin descuidar el sonido caracteristico que los llevo a convertirse en un legado de los buenos temas.Es complicado tratar de encasillar este disco, hace muchos años la prensa trato de poner todo el IDM (intelligent dance music) en el mismo casillero The Camp se escapa de esta etiqueta comercial para liberarse solo en un campo repleto de excelentes melodias, inquietantes pasajes sonoros y dulces frutos sonoros productos de mucha experiencia en saber cultivar cada espectro del do re mi fa sol la si.Queres un disco para escuchar toda la vida?Sin duda, es este."
2,Dissappointment,This newest release from Warp's BOC is quite disappointing. Compared to previous releases like their legendary Music has the right to children and A Beautiful Place out in the country this one lacks inspiration and is an overall boring album for BOC.
1,this album was a waste of money,this album is not worth purchasing because my 4 year old nephew plays the same notes and melodic keys as Boards of Canada does on this and everyone of their other albums! Purchase only if you dare to waste your time with this trash!
2,what the ...,"This is nothing but New Age music. Very *well produced* New Age at that, but still. It dearly misses the magic of previous releases. Maybe BOC should take a bit more time to collect sounds and manipulate them into a lovely whole... and then they could also skip those silly, boring guitars."
2,Bored of Canada (!),"and i never thought i would b.all their past sh*t has spun my wheels big time. but this man, i had to keep checking tha sleeve thinking someone had slipped me some zero 7!Such a bummer."
1,i can't even fake it,"i read somewhere that this band writes their music with the most intelligent music fan in mind. if this is the case, and if being considered an intellectual means feigning an interest in Boards of Canada's tired, meandering, and above all BORING brand of electronic music - then consider me an illiterate, cuz i can't even pretend that i like this stuff."
4,"Their best. More music, less noise.","I think this is the best the boys have put out. The songs all have melodies and structures, where some of the previous material had drums and a lot of noise.Keep it up!"
2,Same Song Different Day,"If you want more of the same old same old with less punch get this. Sure this album has some pretty moments, but as artists, these guys are pretty boring. Music Has the Right and the EP In a Beautiful Place out in the Country are their only recordings with any longevity. Like Geogaddi this will soon be at the bottom of my playlist. Try Freescha or Casino vs. Japan if you need a fix of this kind of stuff, they are better at it."
4,aural.,"The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars is that it is not, with all due respect, a PERFECT album. This version (which I take is the Japanese Version) of The Campfire Headphase is amazing. I think it holds much more emotion, is more ethereal, and the songs are ultimately more beautiful then the English version."
3,Buy the early stuff instead...,"The distinctive thing about BoC has always been the samples of movies, TV, children's tapes, and the like: Orange!Where are the voices now? The new sound is less original, less surreal, and less interesting. Not bad, but it might as well be Tangerine Dream."
1,NOT strong for really fair skin,"I'm of Irish descent living in San Diego. To compare: I was previously using Coppertone ultraguard sunscreen lotion SPF 70. I chose SOLBAR because the zinc oxide is a healthier option for good UVB protection.What can I say? This stuff pales in comparison to the Coppertone I was using. I got burned in the same amount of time I usually spend in the sun, applied as directed, where I wouldn't have if I had been using the Coppertone like usual. There's the proof.Also, it REALLY burned my eyes, and yes, I waited over 1/2 hour for it to dry just to be sure. It's extremely runny and greasy, too, so my goggles kept slipping off my face.FINAL NOTE: Be aware that the amount of product you are getting is only 4.4oz. The ""product weight"" listed on Amazon is 8.8oz. I called them and told them this, so hopefully that's resolved now."
4,Works for Skin Graft Area,"Being as a burn survivor, (went through skin graft surgery on my arm), very important the arm to be protected for the next two summers at least.Invited to Caribbean before the accident. Some doctors and survivors advised not to go. Some advised to go, to heal my heart therefore quicker recovery. My heart was divided.Glad that I went with Solbar Zin SPF 38!Also kept wearing a swim jacket with long sleeves in and outside of the pool and ocean, so it is hard to know how much the Solbar Zinc SPF 38 contributed to the good result, but the part I covered did not get any tan.No itchiness, irritations or clogs regardless of wearing the pressure garment + silicone sheet.For my face, it is a bit greasy. But will use it in the mid-summer.Knowing this one is a safer and good product, I recommend it!Only one thing... I am not so found of this odor.Solbar Zinc SPF 38 4 oz."
1,Homosalate!,"Sorry guys, but homosalate is a xenoestrogen. I was excited when I came across a ""natural"" sunscreen with great reviews but I had a feeling it was too good to be true.My quest for the perfect sun screen continues :/."
5,excellent for sensitive skin,"A friend recommend this to me. My son literally screams when I use ANY other sun lotion on his face, even the stuff for babies faces. It usually happens when the other lotions are combined with water or sweat. I used this on my son and hallelujah finally one that doesn't make him scream.I would recommend this to anyone that has super sensitive skin."
5,Solbar Zinc,My dermatologist introduced me to this product three years ago. I use it as my daily moisterizer and could not be more pleased. I get the protection against harmful sun rays as well as moisterizer for my dry skin. Would highly recommend this product.
5,Real PROTECTION,"I learned of this product after a recent trip to the dermatologist in which I had to get a very dark, bluish mole removed (started turning slightly green actually). I have freckles and fair skin, so my risk for skin cancer is very high without any protection. Living in San Diego makes it even worse!I found that most sunblocks that I have used don't hold up if I perspire from activity, often leaving me with a reddish nose or shoulders after a day of activity. NOT with this sunblock though. I don't know if it's the Zinc or what, but one application in the morning lasts all day, even after playing tennis or hiking 6-8 miles up Iron Mntn. and back. I am a loyal customer now of Solbar and will be as long as they have this product.The price tag is a little steep (~$13 for 4 ounces). This caused me to look around for other brands that offer the Zinc. I found that other brands seem to leave a white residue on my face, giving me a ghostly look. Oh well, I'll have to deal with it."
4,Sun Protection,"I really don't care for zinc type sun screens but have developed an allergic reaction to other types of sun screen. Aside from that, this is the best of the zinc types I've used. You can rub it in so the white doesn't show without too much effort. It is too expensive but I have no choice."
5,Recommended by My Dermatologist,"I bought this sun protection cream on the advice of my dermatologist. She recommended Solbar Zinc with SPF38 as one of the best. Here in Southern California protection against the sun is an every day necessity. I use Solbar Zinc every day. It has a nice consistency and isn't greasy. Because it contains Zinc Oxide, I am careful to fully rub it into my skin (especially on my face) until the whitish color becomes trasparent."
4,Digital Disc For Aural Deconstruction,"Barring three seconds of feedback, ""Sleepwell Deconstructor"" wastes no time in assaulting your eardrums with a wall of detuned guitars, distorted vocals and punishing blastbeats. The album barely gives you time to breath through the crushing and at times intricate riffs, politically and personally charged lyrics and lightning-fast drums on songs like ""Garlic Breakfast"", ""Collapse And Marathon"" and ""[...] As Punk"". The one brief respite is the Isis-like ""Destructioneer Extraordinaire"", which slows the pace but not the intensity. The production fits the songs like a glove...a spiked glove that is. This album is tight, loud, angry and highly recommended."
1,Would Not Play A Tape Without Jitter,Only had the VCR installed for a day or two. A commercial tape that played properly on another machine would not play with a steady image.
4,good buy,"i bought this item from amazon for my son, and fully satisfied with it. the sizing is a bit misleading though. you have to order 4-5 (S) size for a 2-3 year old and 8 (M) for a 5 year old and then it will be perfect fit. luckly i got tthat tip from some other costomer review so it fitted well.as the other people said, the cap is a bit small, but it will fit with the thinner cloth part (the portion of the hat that is folded up) down. the top is not made from a very durable material, and could do with some additional work (like glueing the seams of the front opening in place, so that it won't keep flipping out, and making some symmetrical holes on both sides of front opening and using a green or black wool or even a shoe lace to tie it together to give it more of a ""finished shirt"" lookbut overall, you get a good looking costume for the price."
3,Runs Small,"The costume itself runs a bit small, but the hat is really small. Folding down the band doesn't even really help. Which is a disappointment as the cap is what makes the costume so cute."
3,"Great for price, but hat's too small!","For the price, it's a great costume. It's like something homemade. But the hat's way too small. I got the Toddler 2-4 for my 3-year-old who's on the smaller side. The shirt and pants fit perfectly, but the hat doesn't even fit my 9-month-old's head!"
5,The sun doesn't rise or set or fall,"I had a mental love affair with David Hume. I found myself intigued and captivated and frustrated all at once. And, in the end, there was something liberating and alienating. To believe or not to believe--that's something Hume leaves to the reader. Oh, by the way, technically, the sun doesn't rise, nor does it 'set' or fall. The earth spins around its axis--the side that is facing the sun is day; the side facing away from the sun is night. And yet, after reading David Hume, I might even doubt that explanation."
2,Probably great if I could understand it.,The English used by Hume is very difficult to comprehend. I was lost after the first few paragraphs which is unfortunate as I was looking forward to what he had to say.
5,also not a review,"Actually, the rising sun example is often cited as something Hume was completely unsure about. (theoretically, of course) Hume was essentially unwilling to believe anything, be it materialistic or spiritualistic."
5,LEADING OFF A GREAT SERIES,"When I was a kid in the late 60's and early 70's, I read all eight books in the J.R. Tunis series in his Dodgers series. Anyone who gets into the series MUST start with this one. Roy Tucker is an integral part in nearly all the books (""Young Razzle"" being the exception), and ""The Kid From Tomkinsville"" introduces him along with the other characters. While some of the dialogue is of the ""gee whiz"" variety, the book and series are excellent. I'm so glad they were re-released, and I now have all of them. Now, I want to get a Dodgers replica jersey with the name ""Tucker"" above the number 34. Any kid between 9 and 90 who reads this book will know why."
3,Great DVD for Hellyeah's first offering.,"Hellyeah is an awesome band who's taking Pantera fans by storm. I saw Hellyeah this past summer on the Family Values Tour, and honestly they were by far the best performing band on the bill. Even better than Korn. The DVD tells the story of how the band came together, and how they got to where they are now. It's nice to have the back story, and to get a look into the personal lives of the guys in the band. However the DVD could've used a little more live footage. Hopefully Hellyeah's next DVD will be a straight concert DVD, and not this crap. Great band, great music, not so great DVD. Next time guys, just record a live show and put that out instead. That'd be much more worth while."
1,Stronger but not durable,"I will say that looking at the blade it seems to be much stronger than your normal blade.However, it only cut about 12 feet of plaster and lathe before coming dull and smoking.It may work better for drywall, but not 75 yr old plaster. Still looking for something that will work besides a sledge hammer."
4,"Don't be alarmed when the package arrives labeled ""plus size""","I'm a small woman (usually wear size A/B in pantyhose), and when the ""one size"" fishnets arrived in a package marked ""plus size"", I almost sent them right back. I decided to try them on, however, and they were fine. They just go really high up the stomach if you're smaller, which isn't too bad."
3,Runs small,"I wear a size zero in jeans and small tops. I bought a small and it was extremely tight on me and too short. I had to wear spandex underneath. I am 5'7""."
3,NUDE!!! NOT BLACK,"Stupid me must have read this wrong. I do not remember seeing that these were nude fishnets. really. who wears NUDE fishnets? what's the point? The pic is black, most fishnets are black. The Large title/description does not say nude."
5,Great!,"Not really authentic fifties attire (but it's a costume). Skirt goes to the knee. Actual pink is a little darker than shown. Fits true to size chart. Belt ties in back, like a ribbon. No crinoline included. Overall, very satisfied! The outfit is adorable! Good quality. (Expedited) shipping was faster than expected! Wonderful, thank you!"
3,"Good general book, but lacking re-assuring detail","I'm expecting my first baby, and it's a very unsure time as your body goes through numerous changes. I have lots of questions and I found the book a good general reference on all the subjects that are usefull. But when I hit a problem and I wanted more detail I found the book lacking. You too may find yourself coming back to Amazon like me to look for books that provide sufficient detail to answer your questions. The section on the changes you experience and the development of the baby was dealt with in too large chunks, I would have liked a more month by month approach."
3,"Good, but lacks organization","I enjoyed this book, however my biggest complaint is the organization of the data. The week-by-week pages are by far the most often referred to and need to be expanded with more serious information. For instance in the first chapter there is a case study of 'The Older Mother' it states in this section that there is a possibility of Placental Insufficiency (premature separation of the placenta just before term). This information is not mentioned at all in the 'Up to 38 weeks' section. This is information that probably would have been very helpful to me before my baby died in utero at 38 weeks from unexplained causes."
5,Most complete information and illustrated book I have read!!,I have read over 11 books on pregnancy and child birth and this book is by far the leader from how to conceive to how to care for yourself and your baby afterwards. It provides great understanding to otherwise hard-to-comprehend medical jargon
4,Good Pregnancy Book,"but I wish the author had bother to mentioned that not all pregnancies are the same, every body is different. Great section for fathers to be in this book. Lots of graphics and short yet detailed descriptions help the reader know what's going on. I found the organization a little inconvenient because I couldn't just refer to a section that I was interested in. The index did not inlcude all the information for easy reference either. Overall a good book, but one that you should read cover-to-cover to familiarize yourself with it before using for reference."
5,FANTASTIC,"Although I miscarried, this book helped me during those first 4 months. It also gave me hope to try again. This is a great book, for anyone who is thinking of becoming a mother. It's a keeper!!"
5,Pregnant or Thinking About it? Get this Book!,"I have read a plethora of pregnancy books (being the over-eager first-time mother), and this is, without question, the best, most informative pregnancy book currently on the market. The color pictures are outstanding, and the advice (particularly in the ""If Something Goes Wrong"" chapter) is sound. I refer to this book on a weekly (if not more frequent) basis. It's like having your doctor on call -- don't go through your pregnancy without it!"
4,"5 stars for pictures, 3 stars for text","I have always found DK travel guides to be the best because they cover so much information with appropriate illustrations. The illustrations and organization of this book are certainly like no other, but the tone of the text was handled with no more sensitivity than the travel guides. Although I prefer the reassuring tone in ""What to expect..."", this book complements it well with its broad scope."
5,A beautifully illustrated book,This book is gorgeous--the ultimate coffee table book for pregnancy. The art department should take a bow!
5,"Very Comprehensive, extraordinarily helpful","After looking through dozens of very depressing, frightening pregnancy books, I was thrilled when my freind gave me Stoppard's book. She is very thorough and covers various alternatives including natural remedies and home births. Whatever type of pregnancy and delivery you want, Stoppard covers all of your options in great detail. Her book is very up beat and helps women to keep a very positive attitude during what can be a very trying time. It has been a very useful reference for me"
1,Disappointing Edition,"I was willing to cut the kindle book some slack because Spanish editions are never very well formatted, but this went too far. Entire sections of dialogue are missing, the formatting is terrible, and the few line numbers popped up at random points in the middle of a text block. It was very difficult to guess who was talking. I recommend searching for the PDF and getting it for free that way. The play is hilarious and worth reading, but not in this format."
2,wrong cable,This did not fit my Samsung camera. They did not provide enough information about the item.
1,i hate you,"one of the worst movies i have seen in a while. What redeeming qualities does this movie have? naked chicks, that is all and you can get naked chicks with a quick click of the mouse so what is the point of this movie? the plot is terrible, there is not enough killing, there is just sex and flashbacks and terrible acting. man this movie was terrible and im even more mad that i paid money for it! i read reviews from people calling it a throwback to grindhouse....where? where is this throwback? i do not see it and you poeople mislead me! im sorry but this movie bothered me...i bought wrong turn 5, it sucked but i got what i paid for. I bought beyond the black rainbow, it sucked but it was only $10 brand new and i new i was taking a risk. I bought this movie, it sucked and i feel ripped off. Do not watch this movie, i rarely hate on a movie like this and dont tell people to go elsewhere but i found nothing good about this movie. That is all."
2,WOW...so disappointed!!!!,"I found this movie to be nothing less than predictable. It felt as though I was watching a spoof movie, with horrible acting happening on purpose. I became more and more disappointed with each line delivered by each character. I continuously inserted my own twists and turns during the movie hoping that something interesting would happen because it was just that boring. I can see a good story line here and with some major rewriting and changes in acting, it could have been a great movie!"
2,Disappointed,I use to be a huge Michael Biehn fan. Even met him a few times. But it seems like all he is acting in now is garbage. This movie really lacked. They used some actors who were terrible. An executive producer took on a main role. He should stick to producing. I really think Michael has gone back to drinking. His appearance looks gaunt and his acting skills have diminished. He is not the actor he was in K-2 or Tombstone and abyss. He's not the same actor. He wrote and directed this film. Storyline was amatuer. Not worth seeing...
1,"Michael Biehn, what are you thinking?","I just finished watching this, and there are problems with continuity, and just plain common sense. I found myself asking ""Are you kidding me?"" every five minutes or so. I think MB just plain dropped the ball, letting his ego overlook major flaws with this flick. If stars have to be awarded, then 1/2 a star fits, for me."
