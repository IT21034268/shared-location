1,"great ride, crash ending","Wow! I was so drawn in and involved with the characters as I was reading, only to be shocked and dismayed by the ending. Frustrated! I completely agree with ""Speechless's"" review below, and I won't be reading another Shreve. Dang."
3,A.Schivelbein,"I was really disappointed by this book. The fact that there was no actual dialogue was very hard to get used to. I didn't like the way the book unfolded. The ending was so stupid I found myself wondering why I finished the book at all. If you want to read a fantastic book by her read ""Strange Fits Of Passion"". Now that was wonderful. Skip this one."
3,Who is the Storyteller here???,"That Anita Shreve is skilled at the craft of writing does not mean she is skilled at the art of storytelling!! This is the only book by Shreve I have read and it will be the last. The book irritated me, but not until the last few pages!!! I enjoyed the story UNTIL I read the end, which made me feel disappointed in the whole book. The reason I give it any stars at all is because I do think it is well written, and I did admire her style. For me, the problem with it is the ""story"". I don't like endings that completely negate the emotional andpsychological attention I put into reading them. In my opinion, the ending shows a lack of respect for the reader's time and involvement."
2,Pretentious drivel,"I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing so many positive things. I'd never read Shreve before...and I never will again. Her style is stiff, pretentious, & unnatural. Especially in her descriptives (overwhelming use of superfluous adverbs) and dialogue. I challenge any reader to think of a person they know who actually speaks like these characters.The ending in particular was silly. That last paragraph - unnecessarily tragic. Like a typical Hollywood tear-fest. Sad for the sake of being sad. Silliness."
1,Disappointing!,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I thought it odd that the book was written out of sequence and stopped reading it several times. I finally finished it. After reading the ending, all I could think about was the time that I had wasted reading the book when I could have been reading something worthwhile."
2,I was robbed!!,"I love almost all of Anita Shreve's book but the twist in this one about broke my heart. Ranks right up there with the twist on the old show ""Dallas"" where they made the whole season about J.R. being shot as a dream. Ticked me off."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have read most of Anita Shreve's book and was really looking forward to reading this one. I read the Amazon reviews first and even though they were so so, I decided to read it anyway. This book bored me to tears! The only reason I finished it is because I kept reading about the surprise ending. I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book and read what everyone was talking about. I thought if I made it to the end and liked what I read, then the 313 pages of agony would all be worth it. I was wrong! Do yourselves a favor and skip this one."
3,CONFUSED,THIS BOOK KEPT ME INTERESTED THE ENTIRE TIME BUT THE ENDING THREW ME OFF. I JUST DO NOT GET IT!
3,I was disappointed!,"Many of the other reviews say what I feel about this book's ending. I enjoy Shreve's books because they tend to focus on mature relationships, and I'm always looking for books like that, but I think Shreve was looking for an ending to this book that the reader could not possibly predict and she did it with a gimmick. Foreshadowing always keeps the reader turning pages but the technique has to be fair too. Read ""Where or When"" or ""The Pilot's Wife"" for her better books."
2,Still mad 5 years later!,"I read this book when it first came out, and I'm still not over being mad at the ending. I had previously read the ""Weight of Water"" so I knew the premise of this book couldn't really work, but having faith in Ms. Shreve I went ahead (with heavy doubts). So when I got to the end and found out that I was right all along, I was very peeved! Although I enjoyed ""The Pilot's Wife"" and ""The Weight of Water"" I haven't read another one of her books since because of my experience with this one."
3,I feel cheated,"I fell in love with the love story between Linda and Thomas in the first third of the book. I personally found the writing in the middle section about Africa a bit dull (there seemed to be quite a bit of pontification), but was still drawn to the story and cared very much about the characters. The last third I flew through, it answered so many questions, but the last page pulled the rug out from under my feet. I felt cheated that I'd given my time and energy to care about this story just to find out that it ended before it even began. In fact, so much so that it's highly unlikely that I will read this author again.I also agree that the italicized dialogue was, for some reason, difficult to follow.I'm giving 3 stars to a book that I would have given 4 stars to had the ending not been so disappointing."
2,SO disappointed...,"Just finished this book and feel a combination of depression and anger. This book was tedious reading for a long time, but I stuck with it, sure I would be rewarded. It wasn't worth the ""sticking-with"". What a waste of my time! And for me, who had bought every Anita Shreve book to date, to say this, is something."
2,CONFUSED,"I have not finished this book yet. It is going to be hard to do so. The way the dialog is written, sometimes I can not tell who is speaking. Everything jumps around from past to future to now I am not sure what is going on. Nothing is clear, I can't figure out the characters or if I even care about what happens. I purchased it because of ""The Pilot's Wife""."
5,WOW!,"Shreve really shocked me! I have read ""The Pilots Wife"" and was expecting the same style. The story is intriguing, but I felt angry with the characters at times(until the end, of course). I enjoyed the entire book-each part was written in a way that fit the place in life that each was set. I will definitely read more of Shreve's books and recommend this one."
3,It Wasn't Too Bad,"This was the first book I read by Anita Shreve (I skipped the Pilot's Wife). I don't feel her writing style is that easy to follow. I found myself having to flip back pages to fully understand the relationship between Linda and Thomas. It was not until I got towards the end of the book that I finally saw the full implications of how the love between them had such a profound impact on both their lives. All in all, I'd have to say it was a good book but I have read better."
1,Don't waste your time nor you money,"It is rare that I am so disappointed in a book that I can't find much to redeem it. This is one of those instances.This was the choice for my book club. Right from the get-go I had problems with the way the author writes the dialogue. I guess that should have been a clue as to what was up, but I missed it. It was just irritating.The there was all the coincidences in Linda and Thomas meeting at various times.I hate when someone tells too much of the story in a review, so I won't go into too much. I shall say this - the author let me down as a reader. What she does at the end, she may feel is a new ""gimmick"", but it has made me determined to not read another of her books.If you are so inclined to read this, or as in my case it is your book club's selection, I would suggest checking it out at the library. Also, don't get too involved in caring about the characters. It will be sure to save you money and the agony of feeling what a waste."
3,I liked it a lot but boy am I confused right now!,"I really enjoyed reading this book, but at times found the dialogue/story line a bit contrived. It was fun to watch the characters develop and rarely did I feel bored in any way, as some other reviewers apparently did. The Magdelene references seemed over-done but the language was so beautiful in so many passages I just kept reading and reading. The ending, however, was so very confusing for me. I have re-read it several times, have gone back to the beginning, have even picked up ""the Weight of Water"" to go back to familiar references...is Shreve suggesting that Linda simply died at age 17 and the entire story was a dream? or that Thomas writes his book as if she died but she really lived, then he commits suicide at the end? I feel confused and dissatisfied!"
3,More about Thomas and the Magdeline Poems...,"This ""part two"" novel about Thomas' undying love for his first sweetheart, Linda (inspiration for the Magdeline Poems in ""Weight of the Water"") was interesting in that it was written in a reverse order, where the reader knows about ""now"", but then learns about ""then"". The frustrating part of this book is that I read ""Weight of the Water"" first, and was not even remotely interested in how Thomas faired after the tragedy, I was more interested in the main character, Jean and how she did. The most bizarre thing about this book is the last paragraph....WHAT???? They can finally be together after all, when neither has a significant other for once and Thomas does WHAT??? He was basically spineless sappy character throughout both of his marriages and this just proves that is all he was all along. In real life, he would have been lucky to have ONE person love him, much less three!"
3,Disappointed,"When I finished this book I felt annoyed. Of course, now I understood why the age-17 section necessarily came last, in that it WAS the end. Nevertheless I felt that I had been tricked, & this seemed shabby somehow. Worse, I continue to feel disappointed that characters that I'd invested in, cared about, had been ghosts. If I'd had an inkling of the ending, would I have read the book anyway? Maybe; there are certainly artistic rewards. But I would read it only as an intellectual exercise."
5,From Virginia,"I just finished The Last Time They Met a few days ago. Although I enjoyed it immensely, like the other reviewers, I found the first 50 pages or so very confusing. My revelation came when I realized it was related to The Weight of Water. I would advise anyone who reads this book to read The Weight of Water also. When I reached the end of The Last Time They Met (and actually through out the book) I had to keep rereading passages. Afterwards,I went immediately to Weight of Water to refresh my memory and confirm what actually happened in the car accident."
3,Confused,"I must be dense, because I didn't understand the ending of this book. I have read almost all of Anita Shreve's novels and this one left me puzzled. Guess I have to re-read it. Was Linda all a figment of Thomas' imagination through the years? That's all I can figure, since she dies at the ""end of the book"". Would appreciate someone explaining this one."
2,This story was a waste of my time,"This is the third book I have read by this author, and it will be the last. I was so disappointed in the way the story ended, and also confused, as some of the other reviewers mentioned. I liked the story very much, but the ending ruined the whole book. Overall, I was glad that I got this book at the library."
2,Soap Opera,"The novel has finely drawn characters, and the scenes of life in Africa are interesting; however, the characters never do anything which is not easily predictable, and nothing not easily predictable happens to them. The novel concludes with such a non-ending, I wonder if Ms Shreve just got lost in the morass of her non-plot."
3,The Last Time They Met by Anita Shreve,"I loved the book, all the way through until the end. I feel betrayed by the author. Why portray characters so skillfully, show various relationships so artfully, drawing the reader in, then rip the rug out. I don't read to be miserable. I will avoid this author in the future. Of course the book is successful if your goal is to play a mean trick on the reader."
4,Love and Betrayal,"The writing pulled me in right from the beginning, with its detailed description of both the people and the locale. I was pulled along looking for the clues that helped to explain the complex relationships. I would certainly recommend this book and at the same time I was let down in the end. While I could appreciate some of the reasons that an author might pick this path, I felt another road would have been truer to the story."
2,The Last Time They Met: A Novel,"In comparison to other novels by Anita Shreve, I found this one non compelling. The character of the young girl was of some interest but I never liked Thomas who didn't seem to have a purpose in life. Why the girl could want Thomas was a mystery to me. The ending was a great disapointment andshould have been avoided in my opinion."
3,Insulting,"Anita Shreve is a fabulous write who takes oft done topics to a new level. I was however deeply disppointed with her latest effort. Shreve continually does a dis-service to the grand continent of Africa. For starters, she referred to it as a country instead of a continent. She then proceeds to talk about Kenya as though their culture encompasses that of all of Africa. Most insulting of all, is Shreve's portryal of African people and their homeland. I am not an African but having visited the continent, I know it to be far more than she describes; far more than that for which she gives credit. I do understand that Shreve was writing in context but it seemed to be the context of the expected, not that of the realistic. That said, the novel also lacks umph in its ending. It seemed rushed and the lack of explanation of it all, the lack of a why, was devastating. I gave the novel three stars for the quality of writing and not much else."
2,Have read much better!,"I thought this was awful! It was confusing at times and the ending certainly didn't tie up any loose ends. If anything, it made the confusion worse! The description of the book sounded quite interesting, but I was far from interested after the second page. I think the best part of the book was the vocabulary Shreve used. The story though left an awful lot to be desired."
1,Shreve got tired of this book too!,"What a disappointment! It was like Shreve became tired of her own story and just gave up. The Pilot's Wife was great! The Last Time They Met isn't even in the same league. After finally being drawn into the story, I felt completely cheated by the ending! I've never felt compelled to write one of these reviews, by doing so this time, I hope I can save someone from wasting their time and money on this book!"
3,Unmet Promises,"I did find this book very well written and I truly felt engaged in the torrid love affair which had endured over the years for the 2 main characters.....but, I too felt ""let down"" by the ending. I have thought alot about it over the past few days since finishing the book - I looked back through the book to see if the author had planted any ""clues"" along the way that I hadn't noticed which might have explained the confusing, unexpected finale - especially since this book moves backward through the characters' lives rather than forward. I would be interested in reading an interview with the author to find out if there was any ""literary device"" that she utilized in determining the outcome of this book. At any rate, I think all the publicity about the ""surprise"" ending of this book will continue to fuel increased book sales - save your money and wait until it comes out in paperback!"
4,Anita Shreve Fans Certain to Enjoy,"I'm an Anita Shreve fan and I liked the way the book started out with the present day events and reflected on events from several years past and then events from much earlier in the life of the narrator. I'm not sure what I expected and I found the book to be a good, solid love story of two individuals who were destined to be together. However, after reading the ending, my reflections made me realize that this may be Ms. Shreve's best work. The ending pulls at the heartstrings of the reader with an ironic twist that leaves the reader thinking and reflecting on the book for quite some time."
1,fascination with lost love,"Terrible book...boring till the end (which is the only part I liked).If you are wondering why Shreve likes stories about lost love, and the ""what if"" theme that runs through many of her books, read her book ""When and where""...which I strongly suspect is autobiographical. She seems well-versed in the emotions of love rekindled and its adverse consequences on families because it reflects her own story."
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTED,"After reading the Pilot's Wife and Sea Glass, both of which were interesting, entertaining, and well-written, I'm really disappointed in this book. I can sum it all up in one word: BORING! It's more a book by a writer about other writers, more so than a ""love story"". I couldn't get past all the italicized dialogue, and gave up about halfway through. I checked this out from the library, and I'm just so glad I didn't buy it! It would really be a waste of money. I won't give up on Anita Shreve, because I think she's brilliant, but I definitely wouldn't recommmend this book."
2,A beautifully written book with a disappointing ending.,"I read this book because I read ""The Pilot's Wife"" and loved it. I also very much enjoyed this story until the last page. The author did nothing whatsoever to prepare me for the ending. I felt extremely cheated. This is the very reason I quit reading Dean Koonz - stupid endings that don't fit the books. I may or may not give the author a second chance. I don't need a happy ending, but I sure do need one that fits the rest of the book. I think Ms. Shreve went for ""clever"" and failed. Had she given me even one little inkling of what she had planned, I would say okay because I wouldn't feel cheated. Before the ending I would have given it a solid four stars, maybe even five. Now - not so much."
4,enjoyed it,"english is not my mother language, and i had some difficulties understaning the first half of the book (too many descriptions of things). the first half was also a bit slow for me, but later it became better and i also read much faster. as i was reading the book, i also read some of the reviews written here in amazon. so i was sort of expecting 'something shocking' to happen. and as i read the last page, i was feeling nothing but a bit scared. it felt as though i was reading a scary movie. but it was okay after all. i read her 'a wedding in december', which i really enjoyed and was the main reason i bought this book as well. anyway, i think i will continue to look for her other works."
2,Not funny,"I picked this book up hoping for another tight and imaginative story like The Pilot's Wife. I was disappointed. The book was alternately confusing, frustrating, boring, and contrived. The ending reminds one of the ending of The Sixth Sense, except that you *expect* a twist at the end of the movie. The ending here leaves one shocked yet also terribly angry at being manipulated by the author in this way. I am also upset that this is somewhat of a sequel to The Weight of Water. I may not read it now and I just got it from the library yesterday!! Really frustrating!"
1,pathetic,I love to read and this book is plain boring. Doesn't hold your interest at all. Find something else to read.
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ,"This book is so interesting, it's about two friends/lovers and it is backwards. It begins with the last time they met, when they are in their 50's with families of their own. Then it goes to when they are in their 20's and meet in Africa. And it ends when they first meet and are 17. The writing style is amazing and beautiful, so full of detail. This book has a shocking ending that will definately stay in your memory."
3,Not her best work,"This is the 4th Anita Shreve book I have read, but if it had been the first, it would have been my last. The story is interesting, but it is difficult to follow since 90% of it is told in foreshadowing (or actually, backshadowing, I suppose), and I spent most of my time just looking forward to actually getting the story. Every chapter, you feel like you need to go back and start over again, now knowing what you know. Even though I didn't love it, I didn't hate it until I got to the end. The end gives us a twist that just doesn't work. It was an admirable undertaking, but it doesn't make sense, and it is far from her best work. If you want to read Anita Shreve, try Sea Glass or Resistance. (Or The Weight of Water, which has a character from this book, but I would never have recognized him from anything other than his life events -- there is little similarity between the portraits.)"
2,Last Time They Met,"I have been an Anita Shreve fan for quite awhile, and long ago gave up the ""happy ending"" that I frequently was looking for - but come on! I didn't feel ""stunned"" by the end - I felt ripped off."
2,"Feel like I've been ""had""","I just finished this book and was told by several people, ""Wait til you get to the ending!"" . Now I have and I feel like reading it was a total waste of time. What a cheap literary trick. I also found the dialogue and the way it was written in the book, in italics and without quotation marks, very irritating and distracting to read. Glad I only borrowed this one from the library - I would have been disappointed to waste my money on it!"
2,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Anita Shreve's books The Pilot's Wife and The Weight of Water; I was quite disappointed with this, her newest book. The dialogue between Thomas and Linda did not ring true (it's hard to believe that people really talk this way). The letters back and forth do not distinguish one author from the other. And worst of all, the revelation at the end was very predictable. I expected better from this author."
2,A Waste of Time.....,"I was saving this book for vacation next month, but finally had to break down and start reading it. At first, I couldn't put it down. I was thrilled with the characters Linda and Thomas. About mid-way through the book (somewhere in Africa), I CHEATED! I read the last few pages. What a total disappointment and sell-out. Was the author thinking that this story should end (or begin) this way for the sake of a future screenplay? C'mon Ms. Shreve, your readers deserve better......."
1,A long read,"I had to look twice to make sure I had not written the review from Naples, Florida. My comment-- Ditto. A complete waste of time and money. The ""Pilot's Wife"" was such a great story-- I felt sure this would be of equal quality. WRONG!! I guess I was given thought to wonder how many kids in high school speak in such literary phrase. None that I can recall. Will definitely read Amazon's reviews before I purchase anymore of her books."
2,Very Disappointing - Questions Left Unanswered,"I finished this book last night and couldn't believe - the ""accident"" the book referred to throughout its entirety was described very poorly. And it certainly never said WHY the accident caused the couple to break up - it just ended - saying this ""was the last day of Linda's life"" - no explanation of why a car accident would keep two people so in love apart. Furthermore, I don't understand the relavance of both characters having both been married twice - I can't put it into words, but I feel like I finished this book and still had no answers to several questions. I won't be reading anymore of Shreve's books."
1,Worst Ever!,"I have read many books & all of Anita's, but this was by far her worst ever.She wandered into some flatline space. Not like her at all. Her novels are going downhill. Not recommended to start with for a Shreve read. The Pilot's Wife still is her best work. I can follow most any script but this was just impossible. Sorry. Anita. I would have given it a minus 10 if that rate was available."
1,Boring,"Slow, boring and uniteresting. It never went anywhere. I held out until page 159 and then sold it used!"
3,Roller coaster reading!!,"Very wordy!! Too much description of seemingly non-descript people. Couldn't put the book down, I was addicted and excited based on her other books. I was hoping for a real show stopping ending but what I got was CONFUSED? What was the unspeakable thing Linda did? Was Thomas ever alive? Was this a story that he or Linda wrote? I am lost and confused and sadly disappointed. I am tempted to read it again just to see what I missed!!"
3,Good but not great.,"This novel starts later in 2 star-crossed lovers lives and moves backwards in time unveiling a series of tradgic events and failures in both their lives. Bad marriages, pre-mature deaths of loved ones, etc. These star crossed lovers never get married and you'll find yourself wondering ""why not?"" throughout all of it's 300 plus pages. On the very last page that question will be answered. Don't peek, it's a surprize worth waiting for!So why did I give this book a ""Good but not Great""? The book is broken into 3 sections. The first section ""Linda"" and ""Thomas"" are 52 years old, the middle section they are 26 years old, and in the final section they are 17 years old. The first 2 sections are pretty slow moving but the last section you will breeze through to get to the grand finally.I give this one 3 stars..."
5,Book Club disagrees,I finished this book with ambivalant feelings. First I felt as though I had been duped and the I immediately turned back to the beginning and started reading it again to see if there could be a clue I had missed. My book club disagrees with the ending. Hard to get into but worth the effort.
1,Thank God I checked it out for free at the library!,"I didn't think this book would ever get going. I literally had to force myself to read it. Especially in the beginning. B-o-r-i-n-g! And then after reading the part about Africa, I kept telling myself over and over again that I will NEVER visit that country. The book finally started to pick up some speed in Africa and then I began to enjoy it.........until the ending. I just sat there with my mouth hanging open. I don't think I care to read another of Anita Shreves books."
2,The first time --probably the last time,"The book was weird! The fact that it went backwards was strange enough, but I had to read the last page three times just to figure it all out. This book requires time to read slowly and think. All in all, ok. Just not so sure I want to read it again. Buy the paperback! Not worth the hardcover price."
2,"Just Started The Book, and....","I have just started reading this book, but I really got turned off by the dialogue being set out in italics. It took me several pages to figure out what the author was trying to accomplish. As far as the story, I haven't gotten that far into it to make any comment, but the italic thing really distracted from the content. I have read so many reviews of what a great book this is, so will have to get back to it to find out. I read one other review that mentioned the italic printing, so maybe I am not alone in this."
2,Disappointing ending,"I won't spoil the ending for those who have not yet read the book (beware: some other reviewers do give it away), but suffice to say it was extremely disappointing. This was the first Anita Shreve book I read and had been looking forward to it based on her reviews. The book was about two star crossed lovers who meet again. Much is hinted at what happened when they were kids, but is not revealed until the final chapters. On the final page, the story is wrapped up in a way that made my jaw drop. I actually had to read it twice to make sure I hadn't mistaken it. It made the whole rest of the book, which I had enjoyed up until that time, seem like a total waste of time."
1,Oh -- NOW I get it . . .,"Thank goodness for Amazon.com book reviews!!! At the end of this book, all I could say was ""I don't get it."" After reading about 40 reviews and piecing together bits of information, the light dawns -- I've got it!I'm an avid reader -- 3-4 books/week -- this one took me almost a month to finish. The first section was lackluster; the second confusing; the third (finally) interesting. And the italicized speech -- found myself flipping back and forth, trying to figure out who said what. Although now that I ""get it,"" that makes more sense (and is actually quite clever).I read The Pilot's Wife and found the story intriguing, but was never ""hooked and drawn in"" by the characters. I had some misgivings about reading Shreve again -- once more, an interesting story line, but I just didn't have that tug-at-my-heart feeling."
2,Not Your Typical Shreve,"I could not even believe that this was written by Anita Shreve. I absolutely love her other books, but I found this one such a disappointment. The cheesy dialogue between the two main characters and the constant referencing to Mary Magdalene were very annoying and grating. The ending, which some may find clever, only further unnerved me. For all you Shreve lovers out there-trust me-SKIP THIS ONE!!!"
1,AWFUL...terribly contrived AND a letdown!,"I had such high hopes for this book when I first heard about it. Every ten pages I read I thought to myself, ""Gosh, when is it going to get better?"" Sad to say, it never did. It was muddled and confusing from the start, and by the time I got to the end (I was skimming by this point), it was just a cop-out ending. A big time let down. The whole novel was contrived and just a terrible read. I don't mind a little confusion and mystery, but this was just too much. If you decide to read it/buy it, I hope you fare better than I.I would have given it only a half star, but that option wasn't available."
2,The Last Time They Met: a Novel,"Disappointing! I also do not want to spoil the ending but I found it extremely contrived and not satisfying. Almost like the T.V. series that have some ""strange"" endings."
1,Surprise Ending? Please!,"While reading the book, I found Shreve's writing almost pretentious. Finally, the surprise ending (discounting the first two sections of the book!) was unbelievable, and wrapped up in less than a page. It reminded me of the ending in Dallas (when Victoria Principal woke up from a dream) or in ""Tootsie"" when he revealed that he was a man and made up some contrived story as to how s/he got there! I just thought it was cheap and surprised that a professional reviewer would give it any high marks! I have read The Pilot's Wife and The Weight of Water and enjoyed both of them, but this one should have had either a different editor or should not have been published in the first place. I definitely feel like I wasted both my time and money on this one!"
4,Page turner,"I had to balance out the review written by the only other person to review this book so far. This story about a love affair that can't seem to get anywhere despite multiple opportunities kept my attention from beginning to end. I loved the way the story moved backwards in time, and found that only in two places was I a bit confused about the timeline, confusion that was cleared up within a couple of pages. The shock ending killed me, not because I felt it didn't work, but because I was hoping for a happy ending. The skill the author most impressed me with was her ability to write about these characters at whatever age they were in the book sections. What I mean is that when she portrayed them at 17, they sounded 17. At 26, then at 52, they came across as older, wiser, different....REAL. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and intend to check out more of Shreve's work next time I hit the bookstore."
3,What about the ending?,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. This writer has an incredibly strong sense of place - the descriptions of the different settings make you feel as if you're there with the characters.I must say that I was disappointed in the ending of the novel. I felt cheated, as though I had read the entire book only to be let down at the end. However, if you love surprising endings with twists, this one will definitely get you!"
3,Read Weight of Water--it ties in with this book,I think that this book is much better if you read Weight of Water immediately after finishing this one. They are related and add to each other. I wasn't happy with this book's ending but then I went on to read Shreve's Weight of Water and it made me feel differently about this one. Try it.
2,Not bad; it's been done better,"I thought the ""gimmick"" didn't make much sense.I do like the idea of writing about unrequited love and a long search for love extending over many decades. If you do too I'd recommend reading ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" by Marquez. I think it's a better book in every respect.Askold Wawryszyn"
4,Everlasting Love,"I thought this book was a beautiful love story. I really got wrapped up in the love the two had for each other. The book started slow at first, but it soon draws you in. Using the flashback technique kept you wondering what had happened, but overall, I think it was a good approach. I was somewhat dissapointed with the ending, but I think it presents a good point about everlasting love."
2,Almost very good,"After thoroughly enjoying the book, I was completely disappointed with the ending. It seemed as if Ms. Shreve didn't know another way to end it.Some stories are magnificent with a twist(Sixth Sense). This story didn't support the twist in any way I could see.My opinion? Good try, but it left me empty."
2,Disappointing,"A friend of mine passed this book on to me, and at first I was really looking forward to reading it. I've heard good things about Anita Shreve, and I still want to read some of her other work. However, this book was just one big disappointment after another, until the very upsetting and unbelievable ending. I believe a book should keep you guessing, and I respect an author's ability to keep the reader in suspense. But the end of this book was totally unexpected- but not in an interesting, clever way that some authors are capable of pulling off. Instead, this ending was just totally out of the blue, as if she knew the book was really boring and the only way to get people talking or to even remember this novel would be to add some crazy surprise ending. I feel deceived, like she thought if she added this insane ending, her readers would be fooled into thinking she is a literary genius. Instead, I just lost some respect for her talent."
4,The last time they met,"Another fabulous book, even with the shock at the end. I have an enormous respect for her style and plots. I didn't realize the connection to the Weight of Water at first as I read that book three years ago. Very cunning of Anita Shreve. The reader will become so involved. You simply have to read her books over and over again. The similarity with episodes and places I've lived in my life and those in Shreve's books is what stills me every time. For those of us in our fifties she gives us back our lives in a beautiful light."
3,Jury's still out....,"I finished the book yesterday, and I'm still not sure what I think of it. I guess it really depends on whose point of view Linda's life was seen from. If it was an omniscent third person, then the book is positivly the most romantic thing I've ever read, and my tears at the end were not in vain. *BUT*, if it was all conjecture on Thomas' part, then this is the most twisted, sick novel I've ever read. He's shaped her life according to his will and his desires. Too obsessive for me. So, until I find out the motives of the narrator, I'm still flumoxed when it comes to my final verdict."
2,"CALL ME CONFUSED, TOO","I, like some other readers, was confused by this book. I started skimming about a third of the way through. Then I thought I was going to be disappointed if the ending was good. As I got closer to the end, however, I realized there was not to be a happy ending. When I finished, unlike other readers, I didn't feel like going back and rereading from the beginning. I got bogged down a little too much in all the references to Africa. I have not read Shreve's other works, but I will likely skip them now."
4,Hit Over the Head!,"The novel took me awhile to get into -the events move backwards in time, constantly teasing the reader with things to come. Initially, I found this frustrating and confusing. It finally settled in and I enjoyed it enormously. The ending struck me so hard I felt like I was hit over the head!"
5,ENDLESS LOVE WITH A TWIST,"I listened to this novel on tape so for me the twist at the end was so much more effective! I strongly recommend the audio format for an enhanced experience!Like other reviewers, I did have to rewind/review at times because of the flashback chronology. But I enjoyed the love story. The strong bond between Linda and Thomas still haunts me today.I think everyone can relate to a story about reconnecting with ""the one that got away""."
1,Borrrrrring!,I found this to be a totally insipid novel about two whiners. I had to force myself to finish it. The last page was the most interesting. I read The Weight of Water and liked it better than this story - even though I found Thomas to be self-centered. I won't be reading another Shreeve novel. The characters are egocentric and uninteresting. What a waste of time and money.
5,A True Journey Inside a Poet's Mind,"As a writer and poet... and as one who has attending writers' conferences, I can say that this book absolutely blew me out of the water. I really knew exactly what the characters felt and what they were going through. I loved the format of the dialogue... which really hits home when you read the end. I loved the unique approach to the timeline... and the ending nearly knocked me out of my chair. This book is romantic and sad at the same time... If you this book doesn't do anything for you, then you might want to see a doctor or spiritual advisor... I'm afraid your soul is either missing or severely damaged by cynicism.Take a chance and pick up this book. One of the reviews listed stated that they ""couldn't get into the book"" and then read the ending to see what it was about and still didn't get it. Well... it's no wonder. The book is written like life... It's a process. The last few pages really mean nothing without all that's leading up to it."
1,Don't be tricked,"After finding this book in a drawer after many years (I bought it new and never found the time), I opened it up. I've read other Anita Shreve books with mixed results, the best one being ""The Pilot's Wife"". After reading intriguing reviews about this one, specifically about the surprise, ""shocking"" ending, I decided to give this one a try. I plodded and slogged through the snail's pace, determined to once and for all get to that riveting shocker at the end of the book, the last few sentences to be exact. Boy, was I fooled, and I sure felt like a fool, too. Another Amazon reviewer suggested ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" instead. I am now reading that and thoroughly enjoying it, so thank you. Please, I am begging you, don't waste your time on this one, you will be as sorry as I was."
2,Good start but weakens at the end,"While this book kept my attention and seemed believable in thebeginning, it lost it by the end. As older characters, Linda and Thomas are real. Yet as teenagers, who's love lasts a life time, its pretty far fetched. As teenagers, the characteres seem good friends, but there's no evidence of strong feelings. Yet, these two people become obessed with each other later in life. I found it disappointing."
2,Trite and obvious,"I picked this book up because I was a fan of the Pilot's Wife. However, I thought it was a waste of my time and money. The writing was amateur, and the story was just dull and contrived."
2,Languishing Sentiment,"The story begins with Linda, the object of Thomas' love, but the story is really about Thomas, a poet. The relationship starts in high school & is severed for the first time when the two are involved in a car accident. Years later they meet in Africa, where they begin a short lived affair. They meet again at a writer's conference, over 25 years later. Ultimately, Thomas learns that there are consequences to his decisions, missed opportunities, time lost. The story was a disappointment, too slow paced, the only excitement - the denouement at the end. The story labors over Thomas' feelings, but there is little elaboration on Linda's feelings - her personality seems flat, almost indifferent. The story reads like a bleak rainy day."
3,Tough to get into but worth it,"The first few chapters were confusing and tough to read. After you get past that section, it is a ""can't put down"". Uniquely written, somewhat refreshing change. I also liked the Pilot's Wife."
5,For those who have been in love...,"As soon as I began reading this book I knew it was for me. I am 18, near the age of the two lovers at the end (start) of the story, and I am still getting over someone whom I knew was the one. Once I learned that Linda and Thomas had been lovers entangled forever, I immideiately could relate. I am a whiny poet type, and thus I also could relate to Thomas and Linda. Those are the main reasons I fell in love with this novel. I also love the stucture of the book, beginning at the end and ending at the beginning, the style of Shreve's writing, a thick prose that seems poetic at points, and the cover. (I mean HELLO) it is the most beautiful book cover I have ever seen. well, I shouldn't judge this book by its cover, but what is on the inside of this book was almost as good. I reccommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone who has lost a lover whether it be their death, a breakup, etc. I really enjoyed this book and I hope you do too."
2,What the heck?,"It just leaves you wondering ""why did she write this anyway""? It smells like commercialism to me. I'm a big Anita Shrieve fan. This one is a stinker."
2,The Last Shreve Book I'll Read,This book is shallow and predictable... like Shreve's general writing style.
2,Waste of time....,"I found this book to be very disappointing. It was tedious to read, especially the beginning half. I expected a story that flowed similiar to The Pilot's Wife. What was this author thinking? It was almost as if she wrote the last page on a whim! I regreted the time I spent reading this unbelievable and unreal novel... Now it is time to get onto my new Linda Howard book, Open Season... I am confident Linda won't let me down!"
2,Disappointing,"I've read all of Anita Shreve's books and found this one to be very disappointing. It certainly isn't up to her usual standards. The ending makes no sense and is just a device to fool the reader. Read ""The Pilot's Wife"" or ""The Weight of Water""."
3,An Author's Betrayal,"I feel disappointed in and betrayed by Anita Shreve's latest novel, The Last Time They Met, because she involves me in the story of two believable and likable characters, she encourages me to sympathize and empathize with their often thwarted relationship, and then, like a novice writer who doesn't really know how to end a story, she tries for a surprise ending that hugely disappoints. Shreve has written many novels (I've read them all) and although I applaud her attempt to try something different for a finale (the last paragraph is actually beautifully written), I can't help but feel that I've been manipulated and ultimately, let down. A relationship of trust exists between a writer and her reader. The writer trusts that the reader will give her a chance to tell a story, and the reader trusts that the writer will respect the good faith with which the reader approaches discovering that story. With this novel's ending, Shreve has broken my trust."
2,"We've been had, but save yourself!","This is the first Anita Shreve book I've read - and I won't be picking up another. The main characters were unlikable and unrealistic (17 year old boy expounding on the work of Keats - yep, right) and their instant, and yet enduring, intense passionate feeling for each other reads more like a Harlequin paperback. I did find the descriptions of Africa intriguing and wonder why that quality of writing did not permeate to any other part of this work. I agree with many of the reviewers - the last page felt like a cheap ploy to try to make the preceding 335 pages seem shocking and profound instead of what they were - just plain dull. Actually, I'm not sure why I kept reading to the end - save yourself the trouble and don't even bother starting this one!"
4,I was left thinking.. and thinking... and thinking,"I am a big fan of Anita Shreve. I have always loved and become attached to all of the main characters in her books. This book however really kept in me awe at the last page. I too kept re-reading past pages to see if I missed anything. Did Thomas tell this story? This book left me thinking about the movie ""Somewhere in Time"". I applaude Anita Shreve for a very well written story, but I'm not sure what to tell of Linda's life."
2,I WAS CONFUSED,"Anita Shreve has talent for sure. She is a wonderful writer. However, I was disappointed by the ending..not because I always have to have a happy ending...but because it totally made everything I read non-existant. Even in the confines of the story..these things..these lives never really happened..and I guess I resent that."
4,Romantic but frustrating,"The marketing for this book completely hooked me. I was equally hooked on the book. I read the entire book in two nights. The story and the characters simply came alive for me. At the close of the second night and the end of the book, though, I found myself throwing the book against the wall. I was so upset with the way the book ended - so upset in fact I thought I had read the ending incorrectly and went back and re-read it just to make sure...I feel most readers would want to know just what Anita Shreve was thinking when she wrote the ending. That being said, however, any time a writer can evoke the emotions of the reader in the fashion that Ms. Shreve did, it must be a great book."
2,Stunned by the ending,"I was cruising along, eagerly awaiting a happy ending when the protagonists could finally be together as was meant to be.....and then SHOCK. It can't be! I felt upset confused and betrayed when I got to the last page. It was all a ruse. If she was going to do that to us then maybe she should have developed that plot twist a little more instead of just cutting everything off. For this reason I don't feel I can recommend the book and will probably not read another by this author."
2,Betrayed,"I felt utterly betrayed by the last pages of this book. Anita Shreve is a talented and gifted writer and while I have enjoyed her other work, I will hesitate before reading her again."
2,A disappointing effort...,"I love Anita Shreve's writing, but this story was definately a disappointment. Her earlier books were missing something -- just short of greatness -- but then she seemed to break through with Pilot's Wife and Fortune's Rocks. With this one she seems to have taken a step backwards. I don't mind that many of her books seem to have somewhat fatalistic endings, but the end of this one seemed to be trying to manipulate the reader's feelings. Can't recommend this one unless you've read all her others."
4,a twist in life...,this was definitly an different plot. very thought provoking and enjoyable. occasionally hard to follow . shreve likes to make her reader think.
4,Loved It!....till the end,I really enjoyed the character and storyline being brought into this book from the Weight of Water. I enjoyed reading about Thomas and Linda...all the way till the end. I was disappointed and confused by the ending.
2,"Love Shreve, Didn't Love this Book","I had a hard time getting into it. The main character was really irritating, the story moved with the speed of a striking slug.Great prose in some sections, fantastic descriptions. It wasn't my ""cup of tea."""
2,Didn't Enjoy,"I didn't enjoy this book - it was a chore to get through and then when I got to the ending, I groaned."
2,Disappointing,"The ending made reading the book a waste of time. I felt the author alienated her loyal fans. Perhaps she was trying for an avant-garde questioning of the nature of reality, or something like that... but I just wanted to read a straightforward novel with engaging characters. If I want to read a book by Italo Calvino, I'll buy a book by Italo Calvino. I would highly recommend ""The Weight of Water"" instead, which was a great read."
3,Horrible ending,"I cannot believe I read that entire book, to have it end as it did. I was soooo disappointed. I guess that's why the quotations were in italics(that really bothered me throughout the book). I wish I had borrowed it and not purchased it. I really stayed with the book because I enjoyed her other ones, but it was really slow at the beginning. I probably will not buy her next book, unless someone close to me reads it first and gives me their review."
4,A Haunting Decent into Madness describes this book perfectly,"The reviewer who described this book as ""a haunting decent into madness"" really captured my feelings on the story. It is not a story about adultry, but of tragic losses and how life can altered in a split second. Deeply moving. I also had to go back to the beginning and reread a few chapters."
2,Two and1/2 stars,"I have red the readers' revews first and tried to pay attention to all the details from the beginning, and yet there was no surprise at the end of this book for me. Besides, in The Weight of Water, I really disliked Thomas' charecter, and now I dislike him even more even though he is supposed to be a positive character in this book. I really do like the way the book was written, but I wish the story itself was more interesting."
2,not happy,"The beginning was tedious and the middle just dragged on too long. It wasn't until the third section that I felt the story was coming together - and then the ending. It was as though the author just couldn't come up with a plausible ending - so chose to wind things up the way she did. I enjoyed The Pilot's Wife, but I can assure you I won't be buying another one of Ms. Shreve's books again. I'm giving the book a two instead of a one because it did manage to keep me reading."
2,I don't get it,"I finished this book over a week ago and the ending is still driving me nuts. Of course-I won't reveal it; but it really does make you re-think the whole book. I enjoyed the story up until the end-it is definitely a page turner. But that ending just about ruined it for me-as I'm still trying to make sense of it. A similar book that I enjoyed much more- that I highly recommend- is ""Evening"" by Susan Minot."
3,Avid Shreve reader but disappointed by this book,"I have in the past loved Anita Shreve's books and have looked forward to setting aside time to read her books because they usually are hard to put down. Not so, this time. I was able to put the book down - pick it up the next day - which is rare for me. The book left me confused - I'm not sure what the ending was all about. Was the story true or something that could have happened and never did. I did not like the author's style - starting with the ending of the story and going to the beginning of it. I was hoping that the last chapter, or chapters, would bring one back to the present but of course that was not the case. This is a book I would only recommend so that I could discuss what it was truly trying to say. I think that Shreve writes well and only because of this I give it a three star rating."
2,Terribly Disappointing,"Although her writing style was interesting, I found the end of this story to be bitterly disappointing and certainly not worth the journey!! Actually, the end makes no sense and left me feeling cheated. I've enjoyed other works by this other, but feel I cannot recommend this one."
2,Another disappointment,"I was disappointed with Anita Shreve's ""The Pilots Wife""; however, I read an intriuging review of this book and my curiousity was peaked. Once again, I felt let down. I plodded on and on to what I thought was going to be some major revelation, only to be rewarded with a copout of an ending. I also found the dialog in italics to be extremely distracting."
2,What is the big deal about this book?,This is the first Anita Shreve book I've read and maybe I'm just not comfortable with her style but frankly this book just didn't get to me. I kept thinking it would grab me but it never did. I didn't [care] what happened to the main characters. They seemed totally self absorbed and not in the least likable. I was glad to get thru it and put it away. ... I doubt I'll read another of her books.
3,Well....,I have to say I bought this CD last out of the four she has released and there are great songs. But they are the one's released. Granted she was only 14 i think so the subject matter is a little baby-ish. But I expected more from what people claim is a classic. Never Say Never is excellent! Cop that!
2,A MUSIC FAN FROM NEW YORK,I think the album was poor only one song is good in the album I perfer the second album
2,I didn't want it.,Needed to replace an item I lost so i could ship it out on swaptree. I would never buy this trash but someone else wanted to trade for it so I had to reacquire the dang thing.
2,"Brandy at her worst, listen to Afrodisiac instead!","This album gets off to a good start, but just slumps into and endless string of boring, mundane songs that are good if you feel like taking a nap. Her most recent disc, Afrodisiac, is way better."
4,Enjoyable and hits to remember,"There are radio hits and then some adult material she sings on that was past her age at the time, but that is how music sells - sex..."
1,Isn't She Supposed To Be A Kid?,"I never got into Brandy's music. I was 21 when this album was released, so that took me out of the running as being part of her fan demographic. Video truly killed the radio star. I had the same feelings toward Aaliyah at that same time. To be as young as they were it was very hard for me to grasp the concept of who this album was being marketed to, because ""I Wanna Be Down"" carried some very adult themes and the remix with the female rappers only made my fears worse. Truth be told, the songs and themes although aimed at a teenage audience, seemed to be aimed at a much younger audience and that is very scary."
3,good,good album but the I dedicate parts are soooo annoying !!!! I am glad she didn't make the same mistake on her other albums.
5,I Wanna Be Down,"This album waz a great way 2 start off her carriere, and a great way to show off the mid 90s beats. With such hits like Baby, Best Friend, I Wanna Be Down, Brokenhearted (pretty much the whole album) The soulful legend brandy kills this album ( in a good way) with her smokey little girl vocals which will certainly make u happy on a dark day. this album has both slow and fast songs to fit whatever mood u may be in. The singleBrokenhearted for example is a great song for those who have lost a girlfriend/boyfriend.This is also a great album for fans of 90s music, even those who are not big fans of brandy. Great for rainy days, i give this album 10 out of 10."
1,I wish i could give it 1 star.,"Brandy is terrible. She is not a great singer at all.If it wasn't for the AMAZING Aaliyah, Brandy wouldn't have made it, because Aaliyah led the way for Brandy."
1,I will like to meet you and your brother okay,"I will like to talk to you about your movie and your fans, CD'"
4,Brandy's Young Debut,"Fantastic! ""Movin' On"" is reasonable freedom. ""Baby"" has a nice beat and basic chorus. ""Best Friend"" was a single with a creative beat. ""I Wanna Be Down"" is expressive. ""Brokenhearted"" is sad and slow. ""I'm Yours"" is sensuous. ""Sunny Day"" is bright. ""As Long As You're Here"" sounds old-school. ""Always On My Mind"" is direct. ""Love Is On My Side"" didn't sound that catchy, but the last song is spiritual."
4,"Loved some of the songs on this album, others i didn't!!","Loved the songs ""Baby"", ""I wanna be down"", ""Bestfriend"", and ""Brokenhearted"". Good songs but the others just weren't very impressive. Full also is another fav. Go and check it out!"
5,Most inspiring lyrics and unremarkable voice!,"For being only 15 yrs. old; You must admit it takes talet to be this good! She seems to put reality into her songs. My favorite on this album is ""best friend"". Now that song gets to your heart. The lyrics are so powerful. It's GREAT!!!"
3,Thoroughly researched,"Shane has thoroughly researched the histories of many of the early LDS saints that practiced polygamy. His review provides insights into the challenges and rewards that came with following God's commandment to marry ""More than One""."
4,Lots of very thin paper,"This paper is adequate. I'm happy with the ruling and the amount (it's a LOT of paper). However the quality is quite low. You get what you pay for I guess (you can't beat the price). It's very thin paper, so you always have to have something underneath (like a piece of cardboard) to write properly. I generally only write with the paper still in the stack. If you just write on a single blank sheet on a table, it almost feels like you're writing on the table surface itself.The glue on top method of binding lined paper also doesn't work super great and often tears the top of the page.All in all, I'm pretty happy"
2,Never Again!!,"The paper is very flimsy, and the lines are just way too narrow to be pratical. The price was only slightly lower than for other brands or from other companies. I should have paid the extra."
2,Falls Apart - Gum Inadequate,"The gum holding the paper and cardboard backing is not adequate; the pads fall apart when used. The paper is thin, but ok."
5,"great card, simply great!","i didn't know why this great card got a 3 and a half star rank and so i checked and i saw that that's because there's this one guy who doesn't know ANYTHING and that's why he's such an idiot! this card ROCKS! all my games are running smoother then ever with the best of quality ever, i can't even think how this card could do any better, i don't know what system you have man but maybe it's your memory or something. any way SLIDESHOWS will not make you see the differance between 32 and 16 bit, you have to see a game using and then you'll understand. in short: buy this game and buy it now. p.s - glide sucks, direct 3d rules!"
2,Left me hallow,"If Thomas Gressman had written this about some little known mercenary unit I wouldn't have minded. A dedicated and long term follower of the Gray Death Legion, I expected Caryl Grayson to die after more than forty years of his tough life style.Once again Skye separatists attack the Gray Death Legion, this time with outside support, where they manage to systematically eradicate the entire unit including Lori Caryle and all the supporting officers and staff.The battle scenes are well done but relay too much on aging equipment. In addition, the Gray Death Legion fails to show the tactical high-risk innovation we've some to expect from this band of heroes.In the end only Alex remains with fewer connections, equipment, or tenacity than his father was left with on Trell after his Grandfather died.I'd give the story 3 stars, but the meaningless death of this most celebrated unit weakens the entire Battle Tech Series and leaves me hollow."
3,Even legends must die.... *spoilers*,"The Gray Death Legion is summoned to protect Hesperus II and it's factories in the ongoing civil war between Victor and Katrina. When the cover blurb admits ""even legends must die"" it isnt a good omen for the book.The Grey Death Legion is sacrificed one member at a time upon the altar of war, and at the books' end I wasnt sure why. Perhaps ..., to show no one is safe. The story is tight and well written, but very very depressing at the end. One can only hope that the Legion will share the fate of the phoenix and be reborn. But that doesnt even seem to be on the near horizon.Goodnight Grey Death Legion, my first initiation to the universe of Battletech, and long time companions on the road. It wont be the same without you."
2,Author Had No Right!,"The first time I picked up a Battletech book it was Decision at Thunder Rift...where the Gray Death started. William H. Keith was the author that brought them all together, Grayson, Lori, McCall, Vargas,..all of them. Needless to say I was shocked what this bozo Gressman, did to the Gray Death. This was the first book of Gressman I've read, and probably the last."
2,I just don't understand ...,"This set is a comp of fluffy country singles (no, more nubie/pop/rock-lite) from the early '80s, a thin and reedy voice without great range, but the chick photographed and airbrushed gorgeously. But $100+ for a budget hits comp of Nashville bubblegum pop throwaway tunes? Wow, did I get a deal picking it up for $6 in the junk bin at a local record shop! Her vocal abilities remind me of Kathy Linden, maybe the young sounding cutesy-pie Teresa Brewer pop records from the '50s, but without Brewer's vocal range and power. The vinyl on Charly's releases are $3 staples and just sit and sit and sit on the shelves, if you get a chance to visit a mom & pop store specializing in Lps. Wow."
4,More Analysis than Biography,"My only problem with this splendid volume is that there is really very little biography included. The biography is broken up by 130 well-annotated games, resulting in less than 1/4 of the book being pure biography. We also have an entirely superfluous interview section.The book itself is a wonderful oversized hardcover edition that will hold up to repeated readings and playing through of the chess games. This is a volume that will last generations.After the biography we have both a 3rd party survey of Benko's openings from both sides, and a selection of his problems, mate in x, helpmate, selfmate and endgame studies.This all adds up to a complete view of Benko the chess player. I was hoping for a bit more of Benko the person.Still, it ranks with Tal's autobiography in the annals of chess biography."
2,How to Stay Independent in Your Home,"Started out good, but did not go through all the rooms. Focused on durable medical equipement use which was OK, but could have used more emphasis on what seniors can do to promote safety in mobility around their homes in all rooms. What about stairs? Music was irritating. Pace too slow. Not worth $20."
1,Made me Sick,I took these vitamins and noticed that after I took them I would get a horribly sick feeling in my stomach. I didn't finish the bottle of course so I don't know whether or not it would have worked. Take Caution!
1,Doesn't work for me,"I will finish this bottle, but I will not buy it again. I bought it from a health food store thinking it would be more potent, but I noticed my hair isn't growing as fast as it did with another brand, which I WILL definitely be going back to."
3,Good Insight,"Very good for the unique insight on Napoleon, and a very interesting person. The writing doesn't really flow very well, but par for the period."
3,It's just ok.,I bought this hoping it would be enough and it's not strong and tends to break. I have really good electrics and the horse ran through it and it broke. I will buy tape next time.
5,Explicit Lyrics?,"Why would this say ""explicit lyrics""? Although I don't own this, I'll give it 5 stars for curiosity's sake ... I'd like an explanation of ""explicit lyrics"" before I buy. anyone?"
3,No combined shipping discount.,"The book is great! Disappointed with seller. Bought 6 books from same seller, asked for combined shipping, this book arrived alone. No discount for combined shipping (5 others arrived toghether)$23.94 to ship 6 very thin paperbacks. If I knew I had to pay full price shipping for each book, I would have seleceted ""like new"" from other sellers rather wasting time searching for book from same seller and settling for condition of book they had. Also each book had an inventory sticker stuck on the spine which didn't peel off clean so degrades the look of the book more than necessary."
4,Very functional watch,This watch is very simple but does all that I need it to. I love the watch band and the way it closes. It does not have a date on it or I would give it a 5 star rating. The face is very clean looking and easy to read.
5,Only the beginning,"Garry Shandling gets started here in situation comedy, but he turns the genre upside down in a way that help establish (in 1986) a place for comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld to become legitimate television sit-com personalities. The writing of this show rivals that of Seinfeld, but what has always made this thing click for me is the direct contact with the audience, both in the studio and through the TV screen. His idea of admitting he's doing a television show before a live audience -- showing the audience and even, in one episode, appearing to invite them onto the set of his home while his is on another set. It's pure craziness from the start. Even the theme song is classic. This is a four-disc set that includes some commentary and a few outtakes, as well as an interview with Shandling, post-Larry Sanders. Most definitely worth the price, although I would suggest buying the set containing the entire series."
3,GOOFY!!,I have never seen Garry Shandling's show before. There where parts that were entertaining and there where parts that were not. Bibi hitting on Garry was histerical. But then the episode went down from there. Bibi Beschs' performance was outstanding!!
1,I't wont teach you how to program in MVC++ 5.,"It talks about every thing, but it does not srve for nothing. I wish I could GET MY MONEY BACK!!!!"
2,box worth more the book,"I did not think much of this book, drawings are loose and child like. I do not mean to be harsh, but I do not believe this is a book for beginners or advance or anywere in between. The cover is the best part of the book.."
1,"Great Album, Lousy CD","Marcos is right.While the the original vinyl release of ""This is Darin"" is terrific, this is a terrible transfer. Hisses & pops from the source (an old LP?) are clearly audible, and the whole thing sounds like it's playing too slow, as Darin's voice on the CD is too low.Save your dollars and wait for a better re-issue."
1,DON'T BUY A CD - BUY MP3,"Unbelievable product quality.They made a bad copy from LP.You hear noises of all kinds and worst of all, recorded from the wrong rotation.It appears that another artist is singing.Below the times of the songs that are on CD and the MP3 songs on the Amazon site.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JBWCW6/ref=oss_productTRACK - CD TIME - MP3 TIME1-Clementine-03:32-3:152-Have You Got Any Castles, Baby? -03:54 -3:383-Do not Dream of Anybody But Me-04:32 - 4:114-My Gal Sal-02: 18 - 2:095-Black Coffee-04: 19 - 3:546-Caravan-03: 15 - 2:597-Guys and Dolls-02: 25 - 2:128-Down With Love-03:13 - 2:589-Pete Kelly's Blues-04:23 - 4:1110 -All Nite Long - 03:15 - 2:5611-The Gal That Got Away-04: 25 - 4:0412-I Can not Give You Anything But Love - 2: 53 - 2:37Sorry for my bad english"
1,Terrible quality of a great Album,"It's so sad what Hallmark Uk did to this classic Bobby Darin album? they used a badly scratched LP as source for this release, it's sounds like a one penny flea market record that was found on a dusty attic, on some tracks you can hear they used a poor cleaning up software that makes it sound like Darin is singing into a tin can, and you still hear pops, crackles and his, if Hallmark was smart they should have used the original 1994 cd (USA) release as source as they probably also do with their Elvis cd's because they sound just like they RCA versions. I have to agree with the other reviewers and tell you ""Do not buy"" even if you get it for free don't unseal it but throw it away, and find a original 1994 CD version, you'll find them here and on ebay, and much more worth your money!"
1,Duped...Do NOT buy this CD!,"This is a recording of a scratchy LP. I should be allowed to return it, especially since the samples are not scratchy and therefore misleading."
1,Unbelievably disappointing,I would offer that Mr. Chopra is best advised to stick with the non-fiction. There was a total lack of character development -- every character seemed to sound and act like Mr. Chopra himself. The plot was poorly constructed and downright confusing at times. Our book club read this one and almost unanimously disliked it. And I mean REALLY disliked it.
3,Still not the definitive Soundtrack,"An interesting collection of new and old material. It's great to finally have some of these tracks available at last, but this is still not the definitive soundtrack we've all been waiting for. Won't someone just give us the soundtrack of ""Bladerunner"" from beginning to end without the revisited songs and reinterpretations? Is that, after 25 years of waiting, asking too much?"
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"I wish I had read the reviews of this awful product BEFORE i puchased it. The other reviewers are correct that this DOES NOT have ALL the Vangelis music from Blade Runner. A specific example is when Deckard is going up to J.F. Sebastian's apartment and has the confrontation with Pris. At about 1:28:56 into the movie (The Director's Cut) and ends at about 1:31:40. Ever since I had bought the original ""soundtrack"", I had been annoyed that this was left off. I was excited when I saw this was coming out, because I wrongly assumed that with THREE CDs, all the music had to be on it. It isn't. DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
5,Superb,"Don't hesitate: this is one of Vangelis' masterpieces. Moody, dark and seductive (no surprise to anyone who has seen the film), the music here is also in the best tradition of Vangelis' studio albums. It is a long suite taking the mood of the movie as it's starting point but functioning very well as a work independently.The beautiful ""Memories of Green"" was actually featured on the now rare ""See You Later"" album In many ways it was the stand-out track there. Here it fits perfectly.Other reviewers have raised concerns about the use of dialogue from the ffilm. To me it works perfectly: Vangelis has often blended the spoken work with his music for evocative effect - this is in many ways the peak of those experiments."
1,What I received after ordering this product was NOT the soundtrack to Bladerunner.,"The liner notes clarify that this is a collection of pieces, some of which ended up on the soundtrack of Bladerunner, along with some other pieces by Vangelis recorded by Vangelis on another recording date or dates. The product I ordered was advertised as ""O.T.S."" (original soundtrack?) but there was nothing on the CD about it being O.T.S. or the soundtrack. Before you conclude that the seller merely sent me another product, the audio samples on the Amazon website were from the C.D. album I received. Also, the art on the CD cover matches the art shown on the Amazon website for ""Blade Runner Soundtrack."""
5,Haunting Masterpiece.,"There isnt so much a way to describe how great this music is. Its hard to hear it without thinking of scenes from the film but after all thats why I purchased it. I wanted to live blade runner. I dont agree with the songs added to the soundtrack that were ""inspired"" by blade runner. Other than that its a album that at night driving puts you right into the mind set. Memories Of Green, such a beautiful song. I hear it and it takes me to another level. I like the dialog being added in, doesnt hurt like others have said.All in all, just amazing. Pick it up."
4,"Excelent Vangelis, Dissapointing soundtrack","Great music, but the thundering music sounds at the opening credit is missing. Deckard at his esper machine is missing. The, ""I'm not in the business. I am the business."" music is missing. And last but not least the 'wounded animals' peice is missing, As well as other incedental music. Would'nt you just love to hear 'Wounded Animals' compleate with the haunting cat howls?!"
5,Brings Back the Movie,"Torcon 3, the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto in 2003, conducted a poll of its members to determine the top science-fiction films of the 20th Century. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" came in 1st. ""Blade Runner"" came in 2nd. Snippets of dialog from the film are scattered thruout this CD's musical excerpts from the soundtrack and help bring the movie back to life.""I've ... SEEN things, things you wouldn't believe."""
3,"This hasn't much to do with Vangelis, has it...","The soundtrack itself is fantastic but there's a lot more to be desired about this CD. Too many tracks are missing and a lot of what isn't is somewhat spoiled. What do I need Harisson Ford's lines for, I wonder... Anyway. Vangelis is Vangelis so this album is worth owning. Nothing he's composed should be missed. God bless the old man... Long life to him."
2,"Why? I just wanted the music, not the lines from the film.","Although the score is outstanding, this CD has been a disappointment, as it is a direct replica of the movie soundtrack, with all the lines the actors say.I could have just played the DVD with the TV off.What I wanted was the outstanding score, and the score only.Hrrr. I wish they mentioned that it was ruined this way, somewhere on the CD."
2,Meh,"Here I was hoping we'd finally get the song that plays at Taffey Lewis' bar, but nope. Just a few minutes worth of extra bleeps and bloops added on to what I already had. If don't already own the 1994 version then I guess this might be worth picking up, otherwise save your money."
4,Add my high regards to the bunch,"I add my comments to help overwhelm anyone who's unsure whether to buy this soundtrack. It's very beautiful and haunting. It will linger in your head long after it's stopped playing. I'm thrilled Vangelis included pieces that weren't used in the film. ""Wait For Me"" and ""Rachel's Song"" make me feel as though I'm watching the film for the first time, despite having seen it dozens of times. And it was brilliant for Vangelis to blend each song into the next to create a seamless whole.However, I also feel I don't need the dialogue from the film. And I thought the booklet had too many wasted pages with stills from the film. I can get all that from my DVD or my copy of the book about the making of Blade Runner.Aside from those two minor carps, this is a must-have for any fan of the film, as well as for any music lover with a taste for a haunting, beautiful, and unusual soundtrack. They sure don't make them like this anymore."
2,Not Even Close,"This is the third version I've purchased since 1988 , and I thought it would be my last . Unfortunately , disc 2 is the only part of this package worth having . If you have already bought the 1994 release , it's there again , as disc 1 . Disc 3 , IMO , is an utter cash-grab ... barely qualifies as BladeRunner material . Do yourself a favor , avoid this altogether , and scour the nets for what's called the EMS Recombination set . 4 discs , in film sequential order , alternate takes , even the Japanese ambient tracks which went largely un-noticed . Superior and unprecedented quality ! Fans out there have done what the greedy corporations could/would not , bringing the complete BladeRunner score together better than ever , and free ."
1,"Wind ?? Really, you needed to add a wind effect ?","Ok i will sum up this review with one word: useless.Case in point, only one CD brings new Blade Runner material, and that's CD 2. So don't get your hopes up when you see "" 3 CDs Blade Runner"" because that's just false advertising.Note i didnt put *original* in CD 2 description, because it aint. Vangelis had to add effects like Wind. Yes, wind blowing over the magnificient end titles which absolutely and needlessly ruin an otherwise perfect piece.Thank god i didn't buy this.CheersXavier"
1,Blade Runner Trilogy,"Not even close to what an original soundtrack should be. An indulgent and shameful mess from a spent composer who must have thought this THING was clever. The score for Blade Runner remains Vangelis' masterpiece... a great pity he doesn't know this and instead continues to muck it all up. Save your money and find a technically inferior bootleg... it'll will bring you more pleasure than this head ache. Better yet, buy my copy. What a waste."
3,Spare Me Please,"I'll start off by saying that I saw Blade Runner with my father, and I strongly disliked it. I won't say that I hated it, because 'hate' is such a strong word. Anyhow, since my dad loved the movie so very much, he bought the soundtrack and listened to it constantly. Some people believe that if you're exposed to something for a long enough period of time, you'll grow to like it. I disagree with this belief, for the most part. I did not like this soundtrack. But I DID, however, enjoy track 4, Rachel's Song. That is the only reason I gave the soundtrack 3 stars. If you didn't like the movie, perhaps you'll like this song. If you LOVED the movie, I'm 99% sure that you will LOVE the soundtrack. Just feel better to know that someone who 'strongly disliked' the movie really liked one of the songs from it.I hope those of you who didn't like the movie will still buy the soundtrack anyway, just for track 4. And because the economy could use the money."
2,Good movie ruined by a horrific score. . .,"Vangelis?? How on earth did Ridley Scott come to the conclusion that he needed Vangelis to do the music to Blade Runner? Admittedly, the movie has the greatest cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time, but the score just ruins the whole thing! It's just plain awful! From annoying high-pitched synthesizer to a cheesy saxaphone (completely unneccessary!), this soundtrack is full of complete garbage. The only plus I'll give it is adding in the voice overs to accompany the soundtrack; it really spices it up and makes it just a little bit creepier. The score by itself with no voices would sound incredibly bad and dull.While this soundtrack does have its fans, I am not one of them. All I can say is shame on the Blade Runner crew for choosing Vangelis of all people to do the soundtrack. This is one soundtrack to pass up."
4,Dream music,Wonderfully surreal CD that makes you unsure of whether you are awake or not. Like when you sleep and are not sure what you have dreamt and what hasn't happened. Rachel's song screams sorrow and Tears in the Rain beautifully resonates the sadness in Hauer's voice. Contrast this with the apocalyptic Damask Rose and you have an album encapsulating the sense of the dream/nightmare world these people are inhabiting.
1,Marketing A Lie,"This is not actually a review of the product itself but rather a review of Amazon's product description.Amazon's product description clearly states that the 3 CD collection is ""providing the complete music from the film and a lot more besides."" The description also states that, ""The second CD contains all the remaining music from the film that did not appear on the original 1994 soundtrack.""These are false statements. They are flat out lies. The fact that Vangalis wants to release new music and keep certain tracks unreleased is his prerogative. That's not the issue. The fact that this new release is being marketed as having ""the complete music from the film"" is out right fraud and Amazon should be held accountable."
5,I listen to this like I watch movies...,"...after it's dark, with all the lights out, doing nothing else but listening. This is great, all of it. The dialogue inserted is good too, if sometimes oddly placed (""Blush Response""). Best of all, though, is the music that wasn't in the film, which makes this CD a sort of director's cut in itself. ""Rachel's Song"" is shockingly beautiful; ""One More Kiss Dear"" is actually very appropriate. It supplements the noir element of the movie in a song which, though sort of cheery-sounding at first, has lyrics about death and mortality. (Of course, I'm probably spoiled by The Shining, which had the most chilling placement of older music I've heard, and is pretty similar to this in that respect.)"
2,Disappointing indeed,"The soundtrack's extended saga is as annoying as the many iterations of the film itself. Don't get me wrong, I love both music and movie (saw every version in the cinema upon their various releases) and as works of art, they both earn 5 stars. I just would be happy with one version of each, unadulterated. For me the 1992 Director's cut made a great film better -- now stop there. As for the music, the bootleg Esper edition did the best job giving fans most of the score, in sequence, with some key dialogue (lots of Deckard & Rachel, and Roy's valedictory speech left intact), and with the extra music Vangelis included on his official '94 release. My attitude towards soundtracks is that if I like a film's score, I want it, so strip out the dialogue (well, maybe not in this case!) and let us hear the music as it appeared at the moment of viewing. I love all classic Vangelis (Spiral, China, Masque -- you name it) but this triple-disc set is just a scam. Or a sham. Or both."
5,Brilliant...,"to live your life never knowing vangelis... well my friend, i pity you. this cd is ... ... (at a loss for words) simply put - 5 stars doesn't do it justice."
4,Hauntingly seductive,"I have the sound track for the movie in a record album I bought shortly after the movie was out. I have always liked the album immensely and wanted the CD. I am glad I made the purchase. I think this music is some of the most hauntingly seductive music that I have ever heard and I missed being able to listen to it. It may not be exactly the way it was in the movie, but when I listen to the CD it brings back images of the movie. I couldn't wait to get this CD."
4,"Blade Runner, 21st century.","Vangelis has given a wonderful present to all fans of the movie and his music. Of course we miss the opening titles, that impressive theme is once more missing (why??) but at least we can enjoy previously unreleased music and, above all, there is completely new music based on BR which is particularly interesting since it means a new turn in V's music career after so many ""neoclassical"" albums. Jazz, electronica, new age..., styles he visited in the past sound now as fresh as ever and sheer experimentation is also there to the delight of his 70's music fans. A real must."
4,Great stuff,"Is this the definitive Blade Runner soundtrack? Not from what I can tell. But who cares? This is great. It has most, albeit not all, of the music we loved from the movie, but that doesn't make it bad. So why only 4 stars? Because of the few songs it's missing. Having said that, this is good. It is Blade Runner. It is either Soundtrack, or music inspired by the universe that is Blade Runner. Could have been a tad better, but not worth a low review. Unless you're an anal meerkat that loves crying. Enjoy."
5,A Very Solid Basic Tilt and Pan Head,"This head has been around for a long time... decades I think. The reason to me is obvious. It is a bombproof and dependable little head. I have been using the Bogen 3025 head on different tripods for about 20 years now. It has served me well on many photo trips into the wilds, for weeks on end where a lighter, more minimalist approach is needed. It's great for 35mm film, point and shoot and digital SLRs with up to a medium telephoto or zoom lens. If you're shooting vertical using a longer lens with this head it can sometimes slip down if the attach knob isn't fastened tightly. I wouldn't recommend this head for use with a medium format camera unless you're using only a normal focal length lens.Another plus for the 3025 is that if you're out on a hike and it happens to get sand in the moving parts, it is easy to take apart, clean and reassemble, although I've never had this head jamb, even when exposed to some very extreme conditions."
5,Can you say Kibbutz? Can you say Community?,"This idea of a actual Christian Community really has started to appeal to me. All of Eberhard's books are very good. I have purchased quite a few.If there is such a thing as a ""real christian"", I think Eberhard Arnold fits the description. Certainly one to emulate.Again, older writer and older book. Back when books had meat in them. Not just selling a few nice ideas and extending it to a 100 to 200 page book."
5,Fantastic Condition and Gift,"I purchased this as a gift. The company that i ordered it from had fantastic shipping service so close to christmas, and the person i ordered this for is now in heaven to have this CD replaced. She loves it!"
4,Return To Form,"A return to form. Amazing guitar work, great tunes. The last great recent cd. Better than Love Grenade and Crave man. 4 stars."
2,Almost par,"The pair that I received were not as pictured above. I had previously owned a pair like the in the picture from a Radioshack years ago for like $10. They had a great fit, neodymium magnet, gold plated plug, volume control and a lengthy cord. Well I wore them out and a wire frayed so I was happy to [think I'd] found them somewhere. The ones I received did not have the distinct shape of those shown in the picture and the signal shorts when you slide the volume control. The sound is decent, but I wouldn't buy again."
3,pretty dang good with some tweaked out moments,"this is a good record if you're into late 80's early/mid 90's noisy rock like Dinosaur Jr. or maybe Sebadoh. it's got some nice, melodic parts, some more abrasive, angular cuts and some stuff that makes you wonder if they weren't ""expanding their minds"" a little bit while writing. ""Earwig"" ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Cabbage (is a leafy vegetable)"" come to mind. for a more straight up (i use the term somewhat loosely) check out ""Why should it be such a drag?"" and ""Happy is the eye that sees"" some used copies up there, kids...i say go for it"
5,The best book on love and relationships I have ever read,"This book should be on everyone's shelves, whether single or married - in a relationship or not! The concepts and ideas discussed here go deep to the heart of what love is, and how we make love a conscious choice daily. No matter what place you find yourself in along life's path, this book will apply to you in many ways. I would love to buy a copy for all of my family and friends, have preordered the new book to be released in 2000, and just ordered ""Love and Awakening"" because I learned so much from this one. This author is fantastic, and the book is life-changing!"
5,Can't Go Wrong,"I first read Journey of the Heart fifteen years ago--and to this day it is the best book I have read on the topic of love and relationships. Welwood's succinct, penetrating insights into these topics, and into relationship as an actual spiritual path (in the same way that yoga is a ""path"") helped shape my views in a profound way. Can't recommend it enough."
5,Excellence in Understanding,"John Wellwood not only has a mastery the spiritual principle of mindfulness that he brings to this work, but also a true understanding of what intimate relationships are all about if you choose to use them to become more conscious, aware and alive."
5,I wish that I had read this book when I was 17,John Welwood reaches into the Heart of the relationship between men and women in a way that I have never been invited to experience before. I am an instructor in the art of conscious lovemaking and I use John's perspectives and insights enthusiastically and often.
3,Food for thought,This book is most helpful - it is a 'dense' book - it takes quiet time to sit and reflect on the thoughts of the author - I found this book very helpful.
1,Not Relaxing at All,"This video overlays boring views of the water with loud, uninteresting music and large font inspirational messages. I couldn't watch any of the selections for more than a minute. If the messages had been left off, I could have at least used the videos without the sound turned on."
2,Not what I expected or wanted,"I am used to 'nature' videos to have a choice of nothing (scenes only), scenes w/ nature sounds, or scenes w/ sounds and music. This one doesn't give you that choice. You HAVE to listen to the music that covers over the wave sounds. On one 'track' you actually see the helicopter blades in the screen! I agree w/ one of the other reveiwers - I was looking for waves on beach and all these scenes are mostly of old piers and few sea hitting beach scenes. Very disappointed."
2,two for texas review,The movie was okay. Nothing special. It's kind of slow going at first. I'm surprised that a dvd wasn't made.
3,Not what I was expecting,"While this book is a good resource for parents, it was not what I was expecting. There is only one chapter dedicated to ""trouble shooting"" and speaking to parents having difficulties working with their children."
3,3 1/2 Star Rating,"I'd never read a romance novel by Julie Beard before so I didn't quite know what I was expecting. What I got was a delightful enough novel with a few surprises in it. One thing I liked about this book is that the heroine, Livie, is much older than her lover, Will Barnes. That is almost unheard of in the romance novel world. Also, there is a decent little murder mystery all wrapped up in it too, making it suspenseful enough to keep it interesting (though I knew who the real murderer was long before it was brought to light; nothing to gasp over and be dumbfounded).Another thing I liked was how the couple got together intimately within the first 50 pages, so there is no waiting around till the middle of the book waiting to read some action finally taking place (admit it you hate it sometimes). All in all this was a good romance to get yourself into, but I don't think it's something I'll ever read again."
2,Not that good,"I am giving two stars for the small size. Here are some of the problems I encountered with this product:1. Very limited capacity to deal with folders. Only one level of folder is supported. That means, songs that are stored in a folder within a folder is in not accessible to the player.2. No way to fast-forward or move back when playing a song.3. Pause feature is very primitive. If you add a song or delete one, the player forgets about where it paused last time.4. Control buttons are clumsy. Interface and controls are poorly designed.5. Playing sons in alphabetic sequence doesn't work. This feature, if worked, would have been useful for someone listening to books on mp3."
4,great player with some glitches,"I've had my muvo slim for several months. (I also have a zen micro 5gb, currently in RMA process) but I like this one for the bounce-able flash drive so I can use it while I'm running.I've mostly loved it. I've never used an ipod, so I can't compare it, but it holds a reasonable amount of music, is compatible w/audible.com for audiobooks, is super easy to drag and drop podcasts into, etc. etc.Everything's been perfect until recently. I just started having problems with it shutting down mysteriously for no reason, or if it's touched or if I yank the headphones or something just a little mid-play. I read that this has to do with the space between the battery and the battery door. Whatever the reason, it's kind of a bummer. Otherwise, it's a good player with a lot of features and it's cheap."
1,"Purchased three, all three failed within one week","Purchased one for myself, two as Christmas gifts. They work initially, then fail with in a week. Creative replaced the first one, now the replacement has failed. The two I gave for Christmas have failed also. Stay away from this disaster of a product."
3,Small Credit sized mp3 player,"Not a bad mp3 player.Credit card sized but only issue is the memory is very small,I bought it for the built in microphone which works nicely with real player.Easy to use and light.Also has a radio player"
2,watch for the battery flap,"Creative normally makes good products, but I didn't even have this player a year and the plastic flap that covers the battery chipped off (even after taking care of it well) resulting in my many problems. At first I thought it was my headphones, but I went through three new sets, and the mp3 player still sends input to the left headphone on and off... The headphones work in other mp3 players just fine.This is a decent player but new ones hold more music for the same amount of money. I'm just sad it didn't even last a year!"
2,Hate it but still use it,I'm still using this thing but don't recommend it. The rotary/push knob is a pain to use. It often misfires in the 'push' mode. I usually use a fingernail to rotate it so it doesn't mis-push. I'd avoid this feature on any other Creative products.Playing from folders and the play modes are a bit strange.The battery connection became loose. I had to pry up the poor 'leaf spring' inside the battery cover to make it tight again.Recording from FM is nice but only makes WAV files and not MP3.
2,Creative Needs to Recreate this Model,"I received mine for my birthday. It was great for the first week. My recordings were clear with decent quality. The battery was exceptional for an mp3 player. Unfortunately, the latch to close the door on the battery broke after the first week. It will no longer work unless I tape the door closed. I tried to replace it, but the store (Staples) acted like I was a thug who stole it, instead of a professional working on my Ph.D. I'm stuck with a broken model I've had for a week."
1,Major Disapointment,"First off, this thing deserves ZERO STARS. I bought the Muvo Slim for my son for Christmas, and I am very sorry I did. It was great for a couple hours. Then it stopped connecting to the PC. The worst thing about this player is the battery retention mechanism is REDICULOUSLY DELICATE and was begining to fail almost immediately. Why do these product engineers use a TINY sliver of plastic where they should use spring steel? I expect better from Creative Labs. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!"
5,A great book for open-minded readers,This is a must read for anyone interested in non-conventional medicine.
4,Very good opener on alternative medicine,"The reviews explain this short book very well. I really enjoyed the first few chapters. His transition into more philosophical healing ideas in the later chapters didn't do as much for me, but if your a fan of Weil or even Chopra you'll appreciate them.Dr. Fulton really makes the reader consider Osteopathy as a medical alternative."
2,"great book, awful binding!!!","Believe me, I've been gentle with this book, but every time I turn a page, it falls out. The binding is terrible. The book itself is wonderful, the best, I believe of the series. The translation is good. I like to keep my books and read them again and again, but it's not an enjoyable experience if I have to wrap a rubber band around the book to keep it from falling apart."
1,book with falling pages,I ordered this book for my 93 year old grandma in TX as a gift. She said the pages were falling out. I live in CO. I had to go to Barnes and Nobles when I went to visit her and pay $20 to get her a replacement. I contacted the seller and they made me jump through hoops until they finally refunded the book and postage. But the fact they made me go through those hoops really irritated me. Don't buy their books.
5,Absolutely Amazing and Compelling,"Well when i buy the copy of the Order of the Phoenix in Spanish i was amaze about how good the translation was. This is indeed one of the best chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the story is great and the challenges, that are young Potter has to face are very compelling and indeed harsh reality that he has to fight,and i recomend this book to anyone you won't dissapointed."
2,decae harry potter...,"cuando vi la 1era pelicula de harry potter me volvi fan... lei los primeros 4 libros despues y me impresiono la organizacion: el juego de palabras, la trama que a lo ultimo te cambiaba toda la serie, etc...pero este quinto no me dejo muy satisfecho ya que en el cuarto pasan eventos, con los cuales ya sientes que ya viene la super aventura... pero no, al principio esta mas o menos interesante... pero la estancia en Hogwarts es muy tedioso leerlo y te aburre porque no pasa mucho...no recomiendo leer este libro mas que si andas aburrido y te quieres aburrir mas... espero que rowling mejore la serie con el sexto libro con el half-blood prince..."
3,Good but technical problems,I'm enjoying this book but I was quite depressed to finishing reading page 319 and turn the page to see 537. This is for the hardcover. I don't know if other have had this problem but it's something to watch out for....I am not a native spanish speaker so I can't comment too much on the translation...I'd say not as good as Prisionero de Azkaban and that the story is pretty slow paced coming out of all the action in Caliz del fuego.
3,Bad Binding,I also had a problem with the binding on the paperback. All the pages came unglued after the first reading.
4,la Orden del Fenix,"The hardcover binding is much better quality than the paperback, and no pages have fallen out yet. This is the darkest of the Harry Potter books- most of the story was pretty gloomy. But I liked it anyway. Great for Spanish practice!"
5,I would like to meet the author.,I read this book (borrowed from a library) in 1978. I found it to be very readable and interesting. The author seemed very down-to-earth and insightful. I remember thinking at the time that he would be a good person to share a few beers and some conversation with. I plan to buy this book and reread it. Highly recommended if you are interested in its subject matter.
2,Oh no! Oh dear God no!,"Please, please don't tell me FAITHLESS went for that retro-80s trend! Not them! Not Rollo, not Sister Bliss, not Jamie! Not Maxi Jazz, for Chrissake!This was the band that brought us ""Reverence"" and ""Sunday 8 PM"".This was the band I used to play to my rocker friends (alongside Lamb and Goldie) to show them what's REAL electronica.Who misses the 80s anyway?!This hurts."
2,Subtitle problem,"The music, voices, dancing, and costumes are ideal, but getting the English subtitles to appear is very difficult as is getting the actual opera (after the video introduction sequence) to start.The Japanese setting works very well. The score brings The Water Music to mind.However, I recommend it only to those who have the patience to work through the tech problems."
4,GMRS (2-Watt power) radios require license to operate,"To use an FRS radio equiped with GMRS mode in that mode an FCC license is required. All GMRS or dual mode GMRS/FRS radios sold in the stores come with an application form that must be submitted to some FCC office with a $75 licensing fee. Legally one can only operate the radio in GMRS mode when someone in her/his immediate family holds such a license. (When the FRS radio operates at GMRS radio, it switches to high power mode of 2W output, versus the 0.5W of FRS mode.)(Don't blame me. Just wrote down what my papa explained to me.)"
4,Cobra GMRS 950 DX,"This moderately sized, 22 channel unit provides a lot of radio for the price. 2 watts of output on all GMRS channels and 0.5 watts on FRS only (switchable on GMRS) are available. A wide range of call tones, VOX operation, programmable scan, backlighting and water resistance are useful features. The listed operation time is 24 hours with 4 AAA alkalines. The units come with a hand strap but no evident attachment point. A removable belt clip is included. The units are lightweight (essentially all plastic-rubber construction) but feel well built..."
5,SMOOTH JAZZSTER JULIE LAVENDER SINGS FROM HEART,"NEVER FELT THE SUN is the second album by jazz singer and songwriter JULIE LAVENDER. Lavender is joined on the recording by special guests that include legendary Broadway and film composer Hugh Martin (Meet Me In St. Louis, Ziegfeld Follies), jazz virtuoso flutist Hubert Laws, acclaimed acoustic guitarist Peter Sprague and several more top smooth-jazz session musicians who are recording artists in their own right. Julie co-produced the recording with longtime musical associate (and keyboardist-saxophonist) Kamau Kenyatta (Patti Austin, Earl Klugh).Julie blends smooth-jazz stylings with hints of traditional jazz, a bit of the introspection of vocal new age, touches of classical music, and the occasional feel and phrasing of Broadway showtune singing. The first seven tunes are originals.Lavender has a very pleasant, gentle and wistful voice that is perfect for pouring out her heartfelt messages. The three covers work well too."
1,Thumbs way down,"Oh did this one stink. Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless. I didn't laugh once."
1,Don't buy or rent this movie,"This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time. The unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disapoint you. The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon put its name on this. DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this."
1,National Lampoon Sucks,"This movie is so weak it is not even funny. One star is way to high for this sad, pitiful thing that calls itself a comedy. If a negative rating was possible, I would have given it a negative ten! This is NOWHERE in the same league as ""Animal House"" and ""Vacation."" Come on National Lampoon. Spend some money and hire some real writers and directors!!!!!!"
1,Not in Van Wilder's league...,"This movie is horrible, how the creator of Van Wilder can go on to make this crap baffles me..."
1,National Lampoon has lost it.,This movie is one big mess. It's not funny and relys on sex and stupid jokes.
4,This movie is insane,Everybody is running around like a chicken with their heads cut off tring to fine the bag one bag is filled with money and one is just a regular grandmothers bag which that black guy lost. Their are two hookers in theis movie claiming their French. A nerd guy want the French girl to eat his French sausage he realy can't see with out his glasses. A boy who is a virgin is being hooked up by his brother to have sex with a hooker in the end he reviled that he was a virgin to.
2,"Oh good lord, not Tony Denman...","I haven't seen it actually, but it can't be too good with Tony Denman in it. Most people didn't go to school with him and know what a dink he is."
3,Negative Reviews Need Not Apply,"National Lampoon has been known throughout. the years for their slapstick comedies, and while this movie does not rank with the vacation movies, it is quite funny. Dont rent or buy this movie expecting a witty comedy, because the name ""National Lampoon's Dorm Daze"" should be enough to clue you in on the content. It is a rather typical college movie complete with a clumbsy geek, and quite a few topless moments, a great movie to watch with your buddies, and have a few laughs. I rated this movie a 3 but would have rather rated a 3.5."
2,Cue Yakety Sax,"Starring Hamilton 'Ham' Porter from Sandlot, Topanga from Boy Meets World, Tatyana Ali from Fresh Prince, the Sherminator from the American Pie films, and the guy from Can't Buy Me Love who got a bag of poo thrown on his porch, Dorm Daze is a goofy mish-mash of the typical ""eliminate virginity"" plot and a overly complicated case of mistaken identity - a case that mixes-up a French foreign exchange student and a hooker. What's the difference, right? The mix-ups are really elementary. Same phone on the same table. Identical handbags. Dropped notes picked up by the wrong people. At times it all feels like a Benny Hill skit.In the end, it's too shallow and too long. Way too long."
4,Rate the movie???,"I enjoy this movie... It is my kind of humor... Oh, and my wife hates it... But any movie with Ms Fishel gets my rating!!!"
5,Jazz - Con Brio,I first heard this music on the radio driving to work at 6:30am. I was immediately energized. This is the most exciting new music I've heard from a young musician in a long time. Music like this makes one grateful to be alive! It is worth every penny of its Import price.
5,What a great value!,I have not found a 100% cotton hammock for this price anywhere in the market! What a deal. A perfect fit!
4,Quality hammock,"When I bought this hammock, I remember reading a note that it needed to stretch to get to the advertised size. When I received it and laid it out, it was 5'5"" of area from bar to bar. After placing it between two trees and stretching it, it has gone to 84"" and it needs tightened up again. I'm 6' and it serves me well. I'm quite content with this purchase."
1,Incorrect Product Length,"BEWARE! This product is not 11 feet long as advertised. It's actually 13.5 feet long. Look it up on the merchant's ([...]) website and see for yourself. Do a search for ""PC-14"" Hammock and you will find it.Unfortunately, I only relied on the Amazon listing, and only realized the hammock was too long when [...] sent me the confirmation email which stated it was 13.5 feet long. The really bad part is that I was out of town on an extended trip and couldn't return the item with the 30 day return period. They eventually let me return it, but they refused to refund ANY of the shipping costs, so it ended up costing me $38 to ship to Brooklyn, NY from Tucson, AZ.I feel this was completely unacceptable due to their incorrect product dimensions on Amazon. Buyer beware!!"
5,Tropic Island PC-14 with Hattera's Stand,"Great Hammock ... I started off with using 1ft chain on each end with S-hook. Used this hammock for 3 days and now it's fully streatched. I no longer need to use chain. I believe fully streatched size would be 14"" and stand is 15"" with ""provided"" S-link.We're very happy with this purchase. We are just starting of with hammock in our back yard.HTH"
1,This [no good]!,"This hammock, when I got it was really dirty.And as soon as i hung it up it ripped! It wasnt even stretched 4 feet!! What a rip!"
1,too short,"I saw another reviewer had the same problem I had with this hammock. I received it and hung it from two trees. The longest I could get the body of it was about 5 feet long. I returned the hammock and am scrambling at the last minute to find a Father's day gift. I see some good reviews, but beware that you may get a 5 foot hammock. If you order, be willing to pay return shipping, mine cost ---, as you may not get a hammock long enough for an adult to rest in."
1,Smaller than listed - don't buy it!,"This product is not the same as what is listed. The product description states that it is 60""x 84"" and is 13'long. We tried to stretch it with no luck. Fully stretched out flat we measured it as 57"" x 67"" and 11' in total legnth. That makes the body just over 5.5' long - way too small. We're sending it back."
5,Great value,"This is a great hammock, I paid $69.99 for the identical hammock at a local patio shop. I wish I would have checked on Amazon first. Nothing beats laying in this hammock on a nice sunny day and letting the worries of the world gently rock away. The quality of this hammock is great, hand woven 100% cotton rope, macrame`d ring knots, and wood spreader bars that add stability. The other thing that I love is the size. I am 6'5"" and there is plenty of room for me and my girlfriend. The only thing that you will have to do is go to your local hardware store to buy the hanging hardware because it is not included. Have fun and relax!"
2,A Really Cheap Hammock - Not Recommended,"I tried this hammock and sent it back. ...I found the hammock to be coarsely constructed. The webbing is thick cotton cord (almost rope) that presses into the skin. The main support cords were not of uniform length, so the hammock did not hang straight (although not a problem when you lay in it.) The spreader bars are varnished hardwood, but of some cheap tropical hardwood and very low quality fit and finish. The cotton cord will show dirt very quickly. Perhaps okay if you want a really cheap hammock, as that is what this is. ...."
2,Not sure,"The outside packaging was great, like new but inside the center holding the CD was broken in all packages. The CD's are scratched. Sorry to say we have not tried them yet to see if they will still work.But service was fast and presentation was great.I would still order from you again."
4,Writing Historical Fiction,"This is a well written book that deals with the craft of wriring historical fiction. From what I have read so far, I believe that this will be an asset to my work."
3,"Enjoyable, for completists","Nearly all of this CD is instrumental. The music style is somewhere between country and blues. Those familiar with Ronnie Lane's solo work will be comfortable here. Because it's a movie soundtrack, the music is intended to be background music, so it doesn't always grab your attention. There are some vocal songs featuring the usual fine lyrics of Ronnie Lane. However, Ron and Ronnie's Dylanish vocals are an acquired taste. The recording quality is substandard, and that doesn't include the bonus tracks which are the quality you would expect of demos or outtakes. I find this to be a pleasant CD to listen to when you don't want something overwhelming, especially if you are a Ron Wood or Ronnie Lane fan."
4,An essential guide for Fostoria Glassware collectors,A well researched volume loaded with useful information about this popular collectible. Much of the material was obtained directly from Fostoria archives and includes many illustrations from original company catalogues and brochures. All illustrations are clear in black and white. Products are listed by categories and run from bowls and candlesticks to dinnerware to vanity dresser items. Very comprehensive. A useful price guide is featured. Fostoria collectors will find this volume of value and will use it often.
4,Wonderful Reference Guide to Fostoria Glassware,Wonderful reference guide to Fostoria Glassware. I would have preferred more color pictures to get a clear image of the glassware. Some pages tend to be a little dark. I feel this book is more for the Experienced Fostoria Glassware Collector.
3,I haven't used them,"I bought them, I haven't mount them, and I sold them with my vehicle, all I know they are cheap."
1,AWFUL PRODUCT DONT BUY IT!!! If there were zero stars...,"This was the worst thing I ever bought. First of all, unless you are part computer yourself, don't count on tech support. They hang up on you once you get to a certain point. I bought two of these kits. Neither worked. Im out five hundred dollars for nothing. And Creative Labs won't even talk to me or help me."
1,Windows 2000 + DVD Encore 6x/8x = waste of time,"VERY poor after sales service, EXTREMELY slow Drive, Possibly the most cumbersome, poorly designed user interface for the player I have ever seen, and no windows 2000 drivers (waiting 4 months), leaves me wondering how creative managed to get where it did. On a positive note, when I got this for the first time, I was impressed by the picture and sound quality (accept for the drive which manages to interfere with the sound card (awe64) ). And the cambridge speakers I got with it are the most brilliant speakers I have ever heard. I completely recommend the speakers (4 point surround). I eventually have taken the Dxr3 card out of my system, and am looking for a better alternative, as I recommend you do."
4,it is just great,"The Creative 6x with Dxr3 is great, before this I get a friend DVD, it is Creative 2x with Dxr2, it didn't look good on the monitor if you see it close, but it look good on the TV, but my new DVD 6x with Dxr3, look great on the monitor, and of course look greater on the TV, what I didn't like is that I can't see a movie in my TV and monitor at the same time, and is hard to push the option bottons when you don't have your monitor close to your TV. What I wonder is why in the DVD 2x with Dxr2 you can see both at the same time.but in general, the Creative Labs DVD is great. and easy to use. I don't see why to get an expensy DVD player just for your TV, when with a DVD-ROM for PC, you get all, a quality digital image with a quality digital sound, you can even plug it to your home theather."
4,Great Speed Smooth Picture Can be a long installation,"I am very satisfied with my Creative Encore PC-DVD player especially given its amount of features for it's price. It offers instant chapter fast forwarding on both DVD's and CD's along with great sound and picture quality. I had no problems with the software after the hardware was installed properly. Installing the IDE cable may be trickier than the instructions say if your computer was like mine (HP-Pavilion) and you already have a CD-ROM as well as built-in ZIP drive (You end up daisy chaining the DVD player off your hard drive instead of the CDROM. That was the only complication I had to contact Creative's customer support for. I do however, recommend this product highly."
4,Got it in and going on the first try!,"I approached this with trepidation - cause I'd never done ""surgery"" on my PC before. However, I read all the manuals for my PC and from Creative Labs, and it took me about 2 hours (I did go very slowly and carefully). Someone who is familiar with PCs could do it in 15 minutes. It works swell, and the DVD image is really incredible. One big drawback, tho - with VHS you can tape or do screen shots, but DVD doesn't let you. If you try to hit ""print screen"" you'll get nothing; the images are very protected. Other than that - I was able to see details I never could before..really astonishing."
3,Good Depressing Dark/Black/Goth Metal,Good effort from a Darkened Black/Goth Metal Band.Nothing too over the top but an interesting release none the less.This is a nice one to have in the Ipod for Dark & Stormy days while at the office.
2,00760 security camera,Camera pretty much worthless. Even under a roof the camera wont adjust to any light from the sun even tho the camera is way under the roof.No good for any type of outdoor security in tha day time.
3,At least it's better than the original,"This book is Spike rewriting Lady Chatterly. The original is quite a turgid mess, and Spike improves it immensly by asking the questions most of us thought when we read the original.He also improves it quite a bit by adding a lot of humor.It's worth a read if you like Spike's humor (but I would recommend most of his other books - especially the war memoirs - if you want a worthwhile read). Something to take the taste of DH away is the best way to describe this."
3,The puzzle book.,"In a nutshell, this book is a watered down version of GRE/GMAT/LSAT/SAT tests. The book is not a useful tool for helping one to prepare or get more experience on taking such tests; go elsewhere for that. The book is a good resource for junior-high/high-school students who want to start or improve their thinking skills. The few drawbacks are: (a) the book really should have 4x the number of problems (b) The more challenging sections should give a step by step example on how to solve the particular type of problem."
3,Shopping Mavin,"Bought for my son who is trying for FBI or Border Patrol. He did not really look at the book at this time. May need it at a later date in the selection process. Fast shipping well packed with minimal packing material. Thank you. (BTW--If applying for Border Patrol, you will probably need this book before testing as they put in real languages and fake languages for you to decipher.) Good Luck! Go USA!!"
4,It serves its purpose well.,"This grease gun adapter works as it should on flush grease fittings. It is also handy for greasing the slipper pads on automotive leaf springs to make them last longer. It was thoughtful of Plews to supply two differently sized sleeves to accommodate various grease guns.No complaints about its function but I only gave it 4-stars since it is hard to ""love"" a grease-gun adapter."
5,A gift,Haven't actually read it myself -- for my sci-fi buff brother. Got it on time. Got it at the right price. Got it in great condition. Who can ask for more?
3,disappointing,This could have been a better book if it had a tighter plot. There are few ideas and the science is not as good as in Red Mars. The characters are good and the idea of writing of the future like it was history is interesting. The method of Robinson is flawed with too little action and meandering descriptions. There is no urgency and no sense of what is a priority. I don't recommend this book.
2,Green Mars could have been a great follow-up to Red Mars.,"After enjoying Red Mars, I eagerly picked up Green Mars looking for a great continuation to the struggles of terraforming Mars and creating a new society. Instead, I was faced with the daunting task of reading benign details of journeys and characters that seem to have no bearing on the story. The book could have easily been cut in half and been enjoyable. I had to force myself to finish reading the final 100+ pages due to boredom with the subject matter and how it was written. I no longer have any desire to read Blue Mars based on the writing in Green Mars. Kevin Walloch"
2,Great writer - Crappy Publisher,"I can't leave a trilogy alone and this vision of Mars is so well developed I was not disappointed. Well written Kim, but seriously the publisher should be ashamed. No exageration, there was a typo on every fifth Kindle page. This just should not happen. Read your damn copy before you charge me 8 bucks. The first couple are irritating, but this is a heavy read and by the time I was through I was plain angry at this shoddy publication."
5,Kim Stanley Robinson Does Mars - GREEN,"This whole series: RED, GREEN and BLUE, fully explores Mars like we wish we could, but can't afford.Character development as is usual with Kim Stanley Robinson is great as are the various scientific aspects of the books [you actually learn some actual science ].Lots of adventure and excitement throughout make it an enjoyable read from start to finish. I've read this series twice now, IT'S THAT GOOD."
5,"Best ""hard"" sci-fi I've read in a long time...","I recommend this series of books to all sci-fi readers.It's full of technical details, and the author tells quite a complex story. The whole scenario of the story has such a ""realistic"" feel to it. two thumbs up..."
1,Kindle edition ONLY,"This is a critique solely of the digital conversion of Green Mars to Kindle format.The Kindle edition is currently (05 Sept 2010)a mess. It appears that an inadequate paper copy was scanned to create the digital edition and then not even given a basic proofreading to correct scanning errors.There are non-words (ex: ""faetores"" instead of ""factories"", or ""huls"" instead of ""hills""), there is inappropriate punctuation (umlauts where none should be are popular) and the ever popular hyphenation of words as a relic from the words straddling two lines in the physical editions.The publisher does a disservice to the work and to the readers by allowing this mess into print.My recommendation would be to avoid buying this until the publisher makes the necessary corrections.FWIW, I did not notice any of these errors in the Kindle edition of Red Mars. I haven't yet read Blue Mars so I am unable to provide feedback regarding its conversion to digital."
2,Green Mars is a chore to read.,"Red Mars barely kept me interested enough to read this one, but several times in this book I wondered why I pressed on. While some of the science was interesting, the characters remain static. The description of terraforming Mars is handled well but becomes tiresome after several hundred pages. The characters get older and continue to bicker, but somehow Robinson believes that sex can remain the central motivating force for 100+ year old characters. I'd have trouble believing that for characters past 25. Wisdom does not seem to accompany the age of the characters. Perhaps this goes unnoticed by adolescent readers, but reading about 100 year olds behaving like teenagers is hardly credible. All in all, this book should have been cut to half its length. I bought Blue Mars when I bought this, but have no motivation to read it."
2,Green Mars,"BORING. If you liked Red Mars then you will probably like this one. This is the last of the series I will buy. The books are long on breadth, science, and scientific concepts. Unfortunately, they are also short on interesting characters, action, and editorial oversight. In fact, the quality of my kindle version is laughable. It appears as though Mr. Stanley scanned hand written pages and used a decades old OCR package without bothering to run spell check afterwards. I frequently stared at words like ""Hsing"" attempting by context to determine the intended word. Amateurish."
5,Truely Engaging,"One of the best in the genre, Green Mars tells a story that would make Jules Verne proud. Delving deep into true science and human nature, Kim Stanley Robinson paints a colorful picture of the classic story elements (which never get boring): love, war, and hate. This time, though, a new element enters the mix: science. Riddled with factual science and no fictional science, Robinson makes the creations come alive. The people, introduced in Red Mars (which I regret never to have read), are incredibly deep. However, every book has its flaws, and this one has it in character. It seems to me, that in order to make characters seem more real, authors must give them terrible lives and disturbing psyches. No different here. But, despite the flaw, Robinson delivers a great book, and an epic adventure."
2,Two stars are generous,"The first of the trilogy was OK, it wasn't great but it worth reading. You can't say that about the second though. The technical aspects again are good, however the story is poor. Science Fiction writers can sometime forget that what makes a story is the relationships between the characters not the special effects. The author has has neglected the characters, so failing to capture any emotional attachment to the book. If you are really interested give it a go, but be warned it is hard work, and not much fun."
1,"Actually, I only wanted to give it zero stars","Ok, the first book, Red Mars, was a slog but at least it was new, very well written with lots of mind-numbing detail. Repeat that for another 624 pages and it starts to get very... heavy... going... In fact, this has become the definitive ""I'll just read this other novel and then I'll get back to it"" novel - and its not a 3 book burner, its getting way up there in the double digits now. Toooo ssssllllloooowwwww and heeeaaavvvvvvyyyyyy to progress with no enjoyability factor"
1,Super snooze-fest,"The one good thing about this book is it will put you to sleep fast. If you feel like reading a science fiction story with more emphasis on drama, philosophy and equations then you might enjoy this. If you want science fiction with action, adventure and a sense of wonder, skip this book."
2,Boring,"I read Green Mars because it is a recent Hugo Award winner, and I read Red Mars because it precedes Green Mars. The books document the first 150 years after manned landing on Mars and detail its colonization and terraformation, and wars between settlers on Mars and Earth. I found both books to be pretty boring. The characters are actually quite well-developed---four-dimensional---but not one is very likable. The descriptions of the technologies that allow the settlers to colonize Mars, terraform it, and prolong their lives are fascinating and seem well-studied. However, many interesting plots are introduced and then allowed to fade away, including the murder that opens the first book and the mystical powers of the Mars-born Nirgal that open the second book. There are long, drawn-out passages describing the Martian landscape, its history, and its natural versus its man-influenced evolution. If I read Blue Mars, it will only be to say I read all three."
4,Great Book!,"Another great book, continouation of another great series. Cant wait to get the next book."
2,More of the same,"Green Mars is slightly improved over Red Mars. Robinson finally starts to describe characters better thorough their thoughts and actions. Characters are still wandering around a lot describing the landscape, but it's not nearly as tedious. I found the discussions on terraforming interesting as a scientist, but I think a lot of readers will find it boring. Nothing really happens till the very last chapter and even then, it isn't all that exciting. Robinson's books are really technology driven, characters and a plot take second place. I'm starting the third book now, but I don't think I would have bothered unless I had already bought it."
2,"took me too long to finish, and was not a good ride","Blargh. Green Mars took a long long time to finish.I'm talking months. Painful, depressing months, in which I would pick it off the little wall-shelf thing above my toilet, read a chapter or two while tending to my business, sigh, and put it back.Why? Simple. Red Mars was fun, because it was a proper sci fi book, with the additional colonial political bits. Green Mars is 90% politics/talking about a revolution, and maybe 10% proper sci fi.In short: Take a good idea, then write a sequel and make it suck. No fun here.At least, by the time Robinson started with his political-environmental social responsibility of the scientists babbling in The Years of Rice and Salt, he'd already written a thousand years of cool alternative history, so it wasn't so painful.I dread the concept of starting Blue Mars, even though its sitting on my bookshelf right next to Red and Green."
1,Not worth the time. Tedious and poorly-written.,"The book is a bore. The writing is bloated and rambling. I stuck it out and finished ""Green Mars"" but I wouldn't do it again.This is the second installment in the ""Red Mars-Green Mars-Blue Mars"" series. It is every bit as bad as ""Red Mars"" and that's saying something. The book essentially involves political quibbling several hundred years in the future about issues that defy both relevance or real comprehension. Forget it.There must be something that has caused this book to sell well. It wasn't the prose, the plot, or the characters. I don't know what it was.Try something else."
3,Slightly abovve average,"Overall, this book is just slightly above average. It is too wordy and many topics it does not cover at all. What it does cover is done nicely. I just wish there was more surgery, ER, ethics"
2,This book is not as good as alal the others are saying,"in my view. Its too short, lacks detail and needs to be supplemented by other books. It can be used as a supplementary book but not as the MAIN book for USMLE step 3 exam."
4,Shaker Village,"Good Memoir about the Shaker way of life. 1 Star removed for the pace of the book, which I realize based on the life style of the village vs. modern day, how can the author really speed it up. Good read overall though!"
4,Great intro to Arthurian literature and history,An excellent survey of Arthur and his legacy from ancient Rome to modern Hollywood. Anyone interested in seriously looking at Arthur should begin with this very readable book. Also - lots of great pictures!
2,"The ""Limited"" World of King Arthur",There was actually little that was new to any one who is really interested in Arthur. The book just repeats what any serious student of Arthur has already read in a number of other books. How about a look at the royal women? This continued focus on the men tells only half the story. And this continued avoidance of the oldest CYMRIC sources smacks of racial bias. Another disappointment.
1,Bigotry at its best!,"This book is not worthy of publication. It distorts the truth, it is biased towards liberal religiosity, it is homophobic to its core, it is affraid of pluralism, and it does not really understand the theology of the ELCA or Lutheranism for that matter. If you want to gripe about a denomination that is really making a difference in people's life; then by all means read this nonsense. You would think that in this day and age we would be past the name calling and hate ladden rhetoric. Oh, and by the way Luther was neither a fundamentalist nor a literalist. As you read history you will understand that reading the Bible literally is a recent phenomena. It is blasphemous to consider the Bible inerrent; that designation belongs to God alone. Here I stand... those who take it upon themselves to determine if any group is Christian or Lutheran or orthodox or anything for that matter is deluded. Our task is to spread the word of God and not judge others."
1,: ( --This is my unhappy face,"The whole premiss of this book is rather sad (as well as most of the comments made praising it). I urge all prospective buyers to not form your opinions on such propaganda, but rather by actually visiting different congregations and seeing things as they are. Lutherans should not be attacking each other - bring back the peaceful discussion."
4,Good Radio - Cheap Clip,"I bought this forever a go and don't even have it any more. I bought it when I was working at a local retailer that used FRS/GMRS radios in the store. Half the time they did not work, so I bought my own. I wanted something rechargeable, and had a good range and would use fairly standard accessories. This did all the above. I would also use it for recreational activities with my roommates back in the day and it worked great for a couple of trips to Moab, Utah as well as mountain biking in some of the Salt Lake Valley area canyons and trails. Sound quality was good, range was adequate, and battery life was great. I had no problem getting through an entire 8-hour shift at work using it with moderate to heavy radio traffic. It had some cool features too, such as call alert, and some others.Only complaint is that the battery clip was weak. It broke on me early on. I bought a second from Cobra, but then the actual cut out on the radio broke. Ended up buying a belt case for it."
3,Bad Dreams and Scary Movies,"This book does a real service by showing that even when children seem unaffected by scary movies or playing with action figures during the day the fear that is aroused can show up at night. Too often children are being exposed to violence on a fantasy level that doesn't remain on a fantasy level at night. What the book doesn't show is that even everyday disappointments like a fight with a friend or being ill can cause bad dreams. This is illustrated in Mommy, Daddy, I Had a Bad Dream, which is a good complement to the Berenstein's book on bad dreams."
5,Great books,Wouldn't hesitate to purchase these books in future. One of best purchases I've ever made for my granddaughters. Love them at my age.
4,Cat is happy to see me,"The metal grate top makes it easier for Jerry (the cat) to see me, which seems to calm him down. Obviously he doesn't like the carrier, but he doesn't like *any* carrier!"
1,Aran3 carrier design engineers need to return to the drawing board,"One of the worst designs for a carrier I've ever experienced and the distributor's so-called support leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately there is a model of double door pet carrier that is much better and, as it turns out, less expensive; however, Amazon.com does not have it. The assembly instructions may as well not exist they are so poorly done. The company could very inexpensively post a youtube video demonstration to follow that would be a vast improvement but they are not receptive to any ""innovative"" nor more efficient suggestions. So for now, I'm still using my 25 year old Doskocil dbl door folding carrier, and I'm awaiting the arrival of its replacement from a seller at that large auction site. The Aran3 carrier is currently being used as a very expensive, indoor sleeping quarters for one of the foster cats; I'm glad he likes it because I certainly do not. The design is primitive, awkward, and frustrating."
1,Dismal.,"Lady at the local pet shop recommended this for our 11-lb cats, who are very fluffy and take up a lot of space. I bought it because I needed to get one to the vet today.Picked it up by the handle, walked outside, wham! The handle broke off, and the carrier containing my already-stressed cat fell down and bounced on the driveway.I'm taking it back tomorrow and making certain to buy a different brand."
4,Great to have 2 doors,This is a nice kennel to take your small animal to the vet. Sometimes it gets hard to get your pet in from the side door; it is a lot easier to get them in from the top.
1,NOT HAPPY !,"I ordered this carrier because it said "" 3 double-door carrier ."" A big mistake ! It had only two doors that I could find. I was under the impression that it had two through doors to enable you to put you pet in one side and have another door at the end to "" shoo "" him out, instead of going in and grabbing you pet.I sent this back and will never order anything else from Aran until they can learn to write their descriptions clearly or show where the door are located on a sketch.It just takes a little more effort !"
5,absolutely brilliant!,"those radius corp. folks are some forward thinkers allright! the radius is a completely different toothbrush. very ergonomic - right/left handed - larger brush head, cleans like no other, gentle on the gums AND the handle is recyclable cellulose! the radius toothbrush cleans better, fits better, handles better, feels better - it is far and away the best i've ever used. (i've been using them for several years now.) once you try a radius (or radius scuba), you'll never be satisfied with your old toothbrush!"
2,Too abrasive on my teeth and gums,"I noticed this toothbrush in the tooth care aisle at my local co-op. It's odd shape and size made it stand out from the rest of the toothbrushes. The large head looked like a good idea as it would be able to clean my teeth and gums at once.However, I noticed immediately that it was too abrasive on my teeth and gums, even when applying the lightest pressure. Even though I selected soft bristles, it still felt like the bristles were scraping against my gums.I thought maybe my teeth and gums just needed to get used to this new sensation, but after a month of use, they were still getting irritated so I stopped using this product completely."
5,simply the best,"I was doubtful. Could the design of a toothbrush really make that much difference? The short answer: YES. My teeth and gums are healthier than ever. In fact, I've become a bit of an addict to tooth brushing. Stop fooling around and buy one now."
5,My radius toothbrush,The Radius toothbrush is the best one I have found. Not only does it do a great job of cleaning your teeth but it massages your gums at the same time.Jim Teasley
4,Good Blades,"Good quality blades and packaging. Easy to insert and remove with the handle I got for them. Broke a few during use, but was applying too much pressure and working around heavy elk bone field dressing."
5,OH HOW I WISH COUNTRY MUSIC WAS STILL LIKE THIS!!,"I'll put Jody Miller up against any of the female ""bubblegum"" singers of what they call country music today. This collection is fabulous and I agree with the reviewers below that Jody Miller should have ascended the heights of country music stardom in the vein of Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton! She certainly was just as good if not better. Her voice is absolutely marvelous. I agree with the reviewer below who said the outstanding cut on this collection is ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"". It is out of this world and I can't stop listening to it!! ""Kiss Away"" is another outstanding cut! Also worthy of note is ""When the New Wears Off of Our Love"" and ""Look at Mine"". Heck, they're all outstanding!! It just makes me wish that Country Music was still like this!!"
4,"Awesome voice, So-So collection","I've been a Jody Miller fan since the 1960s and bought all of her albums, so I'm a little disappointed in some of the selections. For example, she does an awesome ""Born to Lose"" (just as good as Ray Charles' version) and does wonderful interpretations of Hank Williams' songs, none of which are included. However, it's so exciting that at last her songs are realeased on a CD. Now, come on, let's have some more!"
3,Needs a wiser production editor,"My comments are at tangent with the rest (with most of which I agree) because I think the publishers have ruined the readability of this book by printing on cheap paper, poor quality binding and most importantly by selecting the smallest sized font. Publishers should know that the bulk of the readership for this type of book is above 50s and this book is hard to read unless your eyesight is as good as that of a 10 year old!Of course, there are unnecessary footnotes right at the end of the book. One would like to see that they are minimized and prefer on the text page. I cannot see why the available technology cannot be used to improve the quality of book production."
3,Of variable quality,"To start out: if you find the idea that cultures may have positive or negative effects on prosperity and stability so offensive that you don't want to read about it, of course you won't like this book. That should be obvious, but in the critical reaction, some people seem to have forgotten it.As a purely intellectual undertaking, this collection is a bit of a muddle. The essays have been edited with a very light touch, to put it gently, and there is a great deal of redundancy and contradiction among the authors. You might be better off with a longer book with a unified viewpoint, but for an overview of a debate that will probably only sharpen in the years to come, this is a good place to start. However, feel free to skim the weaker essays."
1,Culture Matters but not in such obvious ways,"Culture is neither as obvious or as simple as the essays in this book make it out to be. Of course it matters for development, no one needs to be told that (except perhaps for some over-credentialized quacks passing as social scientists).But while the authors may be from Harvard they are seriously under-educated on cultural analysis, anthropology and sociology. Unwittingly (I think), this book borders on arguments that are racist, essentialist, and very very naive. Culture matters - yes - but these goofs are not telling us anything useful about it. What's more they dont even know how to frame the issue. The question is not IF culture matters - but HOW."
4,Love Them,"Does the job, plus they are pretty and thicker than most. =)...would definitely recommend, $44.00 for 6 okay a little pricey but I love them!!! Oh and free shipping, cant go wrong."
1,Didn't Hold Up After 6 Months,"When I carry a heavy basket of laundry down the stairs against my hip, the handles on the long-side break off (the plastic itself, not just the rubber handle - it can't be simply snapped back on). Now I have half a dozen laundry baskets with jagged, sharp sides to them. Very annoying."
4,Killing me softly -- too funny!,"I loved this book. It is so funny. I found so much of myself and my girlfriends here. We joke about it much like the authors do in a way that indicates our refusal to be ashamed of it! I have a ton of suggestions for the authors, too on how to make the follow up even funnier! Well, such as do-gooding and husband hunting do not mix; BAP daily necessities for a work day (including a stylish tote bag for the things that do not fit in the stylish hand bag)... I'm recommending this to all my Betty, Butterfly, Boho and Bogus friends."
1,Elitest and Tired,This book is elitest and tired. Who cares? Even if it was meant to be funny it's not. It's a waste of trees. If I could give it zero stars I would
1,This book should be named how to be shallow and a snob.,"I went to school with several BAPS and will never forget how amazingly cruel and insenstive these women can be. If your parents were not Doctors or Lawyers, if you did not belong to Jack and Jill or the Links cotillion you were unacceptable. Amazingly, they even picked their friends by their complexion. If you were extremely light with long straight hair then you could overcome these obstacles and be apart of the group. I know this book is meant to be funny but my school experience with these kind of women was definitely more of a tragedy than a comedy. Several of these women would not date men who did not have the proper lineage eventhough they had the drive and ambition to attend some of the best schools in the United States. I noticed that none of the authors have snagged ""Mr.Right"". Maybe, Mr.Right is looking for someone with a little bit more substance and character than the BAPS!"
5,This Handbook Opened My White Male Eyes,"I am taking a ""multi-cultural awareness"" class and was assigned to read something from a cultural perspective different from my own. I'm glad I stumbled across BAP Handbook because it gave me a profile of a demographic that I rarely, if ever, think about. The illustrations were particularly engaging and added to my enjoyment of the book."
4,I don't fit in either category of BAPs,"Lucky for me the book was at a local library. I checked it out and read it. I have to admit that I was into the book because of the lifestyle. The high-end names are familiar because I work in retail. However, I don't fit the profile of any of these BAPs. I struggle day-in and day-out trying to reach my true passion--to be a journalist and writer. Every once in a while I like to drop in a Dean and Deluca, Marvelous Market, and Anthropologie. But I know that I can't shop there because it doesn't fit my budget. Reading this book, it takes a lot of money to be a Black American Princess; even if you are a bogus!"
2,I liked it but....,"I'm a little suprised that real BAPs don't invest more. With all the talk about Kate Spade and Prada, what's gonna happen to the BAP if she gets a divorce or her Prince Charming screws up the money? What if she loses her job? I guess Daddy will take care of all of that, right????"
1,Insulting,"I thought that this book was degrading. If you need an official guide doesn't that make you ""Bogus""?"
2,I am so NOT a BAP,"Having a)grown up on the West Coast and b)come from strictly working class parents, I **sniff** cannot claim BAP status. I've got a couple of BAP friends and one super BAP-py cousin, but that's it. I can't even claim Butterfly status. So since I'm so far removed from the world of Vineyard summers, cotillions, and Kate Spade (although I do buy MAC Chestnut lipliner religiously and repeatedly remind my children to remember their ""home training""), it was hard for me to tell when this book was being tongue-in-cheek and when it was just plain out pretentious.I can't recommend this book, but I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it, either. It has it's funny moments, but I just could not relate. And I don't think any self-respecting ""GDI"" will relate, either. I do appreciate, however, the fact that there's a book out there that doesn't illustrate all Black folks as middle-class, under-educated, shouting in church on Sundays, homemade baby-naming clowns."
5,Entertaining,"A must have for all BAPS, those who want to be, or the curious. It was a refreshing and enjoyable satire. Would make a great Christmas present for girlfriends!"
4,Butterfly til I die,"I laughed aloud and read this in one night. I can now hand someone this book in response to: ""Why are you LIKE that?"" I am so not afraid of who I am and this book just boosts my ego that much more. Thank you ladies for being so on point about who we BAP's really are. I'm now on my way to the MAC store...."
4,Interesting & Funny,"All my BAP friends told me I had to get it, so I did. Mostly it was funny. Some of it was snobbish, but I think it was meant in jest. At least I hope. People shouldn't take stuff so seriously. Just enjoy it. You may be surprised at finding yourself in it."
3,"yes, no, fripp, kinda","Well geez, yeah a very innovative drummer in the Yes genre, but a true jazz player? Nah. I'm personally disappointed in the percussion side of this venture, I expected a whole lot more from Mr. Bruford,"
4,Engaging and Worthwhile,"The author does a fine job of convincing us that moral zealotry and persecution, including torture and murder as well as mere reputation smearing, are typically the work of those with a sense of the pure and the impure. The chapter on the deterioration of tolerance in China is especially helpful here. Mao and his moral dogmas were the catalyst. Prior to that, a Confucian tolerance reigned. The chapter on the French Revolution shows convincingly that the purists can be revolutionary, as any walk across campus today can reveal. The author is not interested in the zealots on campus these days, but instead aims his big guns at political tyrannies such as Communism and Fascism."
5,Great Instructional Support,I brought this as a supplement to instruction and it worked great. Even my own children watched it more than Barney.
1,Not what I received,The item in the picture was not what I received. The item received didn't work for my husband. He was very disappointed. We will be trying something after doing more research for a better product. Too many pills to take and nothing happen.
5,Beautiful doll,This is a beautiful doll. I purchased one for my 5yr. old granddaughter and her best friend. They both love her and her pretty spinning dress. They both love princesses and ballet. I am so appreciative that Mattel produces African American version of most of their Barbie dolls. It's so important that our little African American girls have doll that they can identify with also.
4,Pretty,"Very pretty Barbie who is now naked like all of the other Barbies in our house. I'm not sure what else I can say after a statement like that, but she was a welcomed gift for our 5 year old this Christmas!"
4,My daugther's love this doll,My daughters love this doll. I bought it over 3 years ago and they still fight over it.
5,"""Soulmates"" delivers!","I was pleasantly surprised to find that ""Soulmates"" is not New Age pablum, but a delightful mixture of solid psychology and ... and what? Warm mysticism? Course in Miracles wisdom? Whatever the second part, the first part, solid psychology, is undeniable, and the author's wit, honesty, modesty and self-disclosure make the book a great read. Believe it or not, it may even help you find (or create) a soulmate."
2,Didn't Verify Her Stories,"The author did not verify her story about Herman Rosenblatt, the soulmate who had food tossed to him in a concentration camp, because Rosenblatt's story has been proven to be false and he admits this. Are they still considered soulmates? This book was published in 2000 and I just read it in 2010. This makes me queasy about the rest of the ""stories"" the author cites.Besides, the Rosenblatt falsehood, I found nothing concrete to find a soulmate. The author only suggests one listen to ""inner guidance."" I found that simplistic and not very helpful.Since the author is a fan of A Course In Miracles, it would be better to just follow that than wasting the time on this book."
3,rating is a matter of taste,that's why I do not rate the book. I need to fill in 7 more words. When you beieve in ...
5,"At last, a Users Guide","Much has been written about soulmates, and the term has become almost generic. True soulmates do NOT automatically find each other, contrary to popular belief. The forces which operate this Universe do not guarantee us all a perfect mate, only the possibility of finding one. Carolyn Millers painstaking research has discovered some core truths about the process, and she outlines some ways in which we may refine and enhance what was heretofore, a haphazard search. The real life people, from whom these conclusions were drawn, I am sure, will attest to the guidance that brought them together. It is this guidance that Dr. Miller helps us to understand and use. We can all find the Pot of Gold at the end of the Rainbow, if we will just read the signs, and ""Soulmates"" is the best road-map I have ever encountered."
3,Black and White Works,"I got this all-in-one because I was receiving random faxes and didn't have a fax machine. I came to find out that they were just junk faxes and nothing could be done, so I changed my phone number.It is also nice to have a copy machine that you can just feed paper into and get copies from without having to mess around with the scanner and software.As far as a printer, my color ink stopped working after a few months, maybe because I didn't use it much? So now I use it only for black and white printing and that seems to work just fine, I'm on my 3rd black ink cartage now.So maybe I just got a lemon as far as color printing is concerned, but I can't justify buying new color ink just to find it it doesn't work, it does say that there is still ink in there and I only printed in color a half dozen times, so there should be. If you are just looking for a printer I think you could do better, but if you need an all-in-one it does a pretty good job."
1,"If I could give it a zero, I would","I was shocked when I opened the shipping box and found the box of candy surrounded only by a small amount of brown crumpled paper. I thought, ""This is lousy packing for fragile candy."" I was right. I get better packing on EBay from independent sellers than I did from this COMPANY. The candy was a mess, ranging from pieces broken off to shattered to crushed into powder. Not only that, the wrappers were sticky with some actually gooey. What a disappointment. I was looking forward to trying some of their retro mixes, but I'm not about to waste my money for crushed, melted candy and OVERPRICED PRICED SHIPPING with LOUSY PACKING. Phooey."
1,Little usefull information about potty training,"Short volume, full of pictures, with little useful content. Too much is written about diapering and diapering styles, including cloth diapers.More details about potty training should be expected of a book with this title.Very diapointed."
3,"Image IntraKera Deep Penetrating Leave-In Conditioning Complex, 10-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)","If you see very carefully they look like the same product but one says Conditioner and the one's that I ordered is blank on the front it just say'sImage IntraKera Deep Penetrating Leave-In Conditioning Complex, 10-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)"
5,"If you want to move to VB.Net, Buy This Book!","This book was terrific. I usually do not read technical books cover to cover, I usually just go to the chapters I need when I need them. However, this book was so good, that I read every page. The author does a terrific job of explaining the differences between VB and VB.Net. It has great examples and terrific insight into .Net, OOP, Bugproofing and error handling, XML, databases, ado.net, and much more. If you are serious about becoming a VB.NET developer, you must have this book."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,This book is exactly what I was looking for. It moves at just the right pace to make it very readable. It is perfect for the VB programmer who is moving to VB.net.
3,Ony cover half the information,"There is so much that is lacking in this book. First, it is not user friendly. It is difficult to follow. Second, it simply does not cover enough information that one needs in order to truly be able to use .Net technology."
2,Another average B.Brown CD,"The only songs that are good are the unreleased songs She's My Lady, I Want, I Need You and One More Night. Bobby should have put the quiet storm remix to Something In Common on the CD that would've have earned hom three stars."
1,We loved this Barbie!,We Loved this barbie. My little girl who is 8 was so happy to have her. She has played with her and is the envy of her friends. She is beautiful and so much fun for the little girls to dance with. She instucts in such a sweet patient way and complements the girls. She plays such beautiful and soothing music. I would recomend her for any child over 5
2,Not as great as it sounds...,"I got this Barbie for my 3 year old girl and the look on her face was a treat. As a Christmas present for her, its was not the easiest thing to wrap, but trying to take the doll out was terrible. There were so many bits to undo/ untie/ tear off/ take apart, she had lost interest by the time it was out. On top of that, the amount of batteries this thing takes is a joke.Once we finally got it running, i found that the arms tend to get stuck or disnt respond like it should, especially in the interactive mode. The mechanism/ motors were louder than i thought, even with the music going.I dont think this doll is suitable for my 3 year old, and perhaps if she was a couple of years older, she would have enjoyed and appreciated it more.The idea is good, but could still be improved."
2,Got old quick,"My 4 1/2 yr. old asked Santa for this one so she was excited when she got it, but has only played with it a handful of times. The arms only move up and down and one leg lifts. The doll is mostly programmed to those little movements so it seems pointless to have remote wrist bands and a remote ankle band."
2,Disappointed,"The doll was not up to my expections. My daughter loved it the day she got it - but hasn't played with it since. The doll doesn't ""dance"" with her correctly. It really just does her own thing. I wouldn't waste my money on it!"
3,Could have been better.,"I think the premise of this doll was a great idea. However, there are many ""bugs"" in this toy. She often gets stuck in her dress while performing. She also get stuck mid-performance and ""clicks"". If it were a once in awhile occurence it would not be a big deal to me but it happens each and every time she is played with.Still, my four year old daughter loves her and enjoyes playing with her without the stand."
3,Didn't work right,"When my daughter saw this doll, she immediately started earning money so that she could buy it. When she did get the doll, she was ultimately disappointed. The doll dances by herself beautifully, but she really wanted the doll so that she could dance with her. If you just want the doll to move when you move, it does that, but unless ours was defective, the doll did not do exactly what my daughter did. Sometimes it would do the exact opposite, sometimes it wouldn't do anything like what she did. Everyone in my family tested it out, and everyone agreed that when it comes to the doll dancing with the girl, it's a dud. Other than that, it's a gorgeous looking doll and dances very nicely by itself."
2,"interactive princess genevieve ""lets dance doll",Dolls were purchased to sell on ebay. Did not sell. Focus was on Bratz's dolls.
2,Missing 4 pieces,Ordered for my daughter's birthday....description had stated that the top of the box was damaged or open which I knew wouldn't really bother her. However when we got the package she was missing her crown and all of the interactive bands. also the doll and stand were dirty. I would have returned it but my daughter is the one who opened the package and it is hard when she had been waiting and you can't just bring to the store same day and get a new one. In the future I will not be risking a damaged box purchase again.
4,Shop around,"I thought my grandaughter would love this as she goes to ballet and loves barbie dolls, but the price really put me off. However, if you have time then shop around. I looked on e-bay and eventually found this item,new, still in its box(unwanted childs present). My winning bid was under 10. Genevieve arrived in the post today. I unpacked her, bought cheap batteries at Tesco,and tried her out myself. Great fun and no problem with assembly. What a bargain!"
2,Interactive disappointment,"This toy was such a disappointment to my 6 year old daughter and her friends. The movements are very jerky and limited. It only works if posed correctly before starting and then often times only one arm will raise.Avoid this toy, especially for the cost!"
2,Daughter already lost interest!,"The doll was cute and bigger than the average barbie. Unfortunately, the doll was so limited on what it does or mimics that my daughter immediately lost interest. And worst of all because there are no other barbies that are the same size as this one or Ken dolls Barbie looks like a giant which is a factor to why my daughter sets her aside when playing with other dolls. I for one thought this purchase was great for the price but even then if your child doesn't play with it, then it becomes just a waste of money. We both prefer Bratz dolls so I guess I should have stuck with what I know my daughter likes. Not my daughters favorite."
1,Very disappointing...,"I purchased this for my 6yo. She was very frustrated that the doll didn't respond to her movements in the play with me mode. Needless to say, she ended up ripping off the bracelets and storming off to another room. Add in the loud music and the 10 batteries, at any price (I paid $25), it's just not worth it."
3,"Dance with me, not","The doll is beautiful, and the music is pretty too. The doll does dance nicely alone,but the little wrist bands only worked for one of her arms, the dolls right arm would not move when my daughters did, very disappointing over all doll was worth the money"
2,Didn't work,"This was the one big thing my 5 year old asked Santa for this year. Needless to say, she was disappointed that the ""elves"" let this one through because it didn't work. There's nothing worse to a kid than a broken toy from Santa on Christmas morning. The only thing that moved on the doll was the leg. One arm moved a little and then clicked continuously and the other one didn't move at all. We bought a replacement doll only to find out that one of the arms was messed up on it to. We are now on doll number 3 and beginning to loose our patience. If she did not want this doll so desperately, it would definately be going back for good. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the doll is exceptionally beautiful and my daughter totally loves her, even not working. Now if we can only find one that works!"
2,Didn't work,"I bought this for my 6 year old niece who loves ballet and barbie. I was very disappointed that neither of the wrist bands worked. (The child is supposed to be able to wear the bands and make Barbie dance with her as child moves her wrists) Even my tech savy husband and brother -in-law were unable to get it to operate. The ""teaching mode"" worked but it was boring and my niece just got frustrated with the toy."
2,not what it seems,We got the doll its pretty and the music is nice but every time it moves you hear this awful buzzing sound and feedback in the music and her are get stuck once and a while just shaking in one place. My daughter doesn't even like to play wit it
3,Buyer's remorse??,"My daughter wanted this doll for Xmas. It was expensive for a barbie doll, but well worth it when she opened her gift. She was so excited! Out of the box came a large and beautiful barbie ballerina. The doll is supposed to dance and interact with the child. It dances, but the arm continually sticks. The interactivity part is the worst, however: it will not move, no matter what we do, with the bracelets that are provided. It takes A LOT of batteries and we have changed them several times hoping that will solve the problem. I will try to get a call in to the company for help. It's a good thing that she lost interest and moved on to her other toys..."
1,Such a bummer...,"My 3 year old daughter squealed with delight upon opening this toy Christmas morning. For the entire day, she played with it and told me over and over how much she loved it. I wasn't expecting it to last forever, but the thing doesn't work at all one month later. Her arms get stuck in this repetitive motion and she no longer does the moves she's describing in the ""teach"" mode. My daughter is bummed and I feel like I wasted my money."
1,big disappointment,We can't get the doll to move according to my daughters instructions by using the wrist and ankle bands. It seems like it has a mind of it's own. The music is annoying after about five minutes. It just repeats a short tune over and over. It's just not worth the money.
1,do not buy,Do not waste your money on this toy. It does not work. My daughter was heart-broken on Christmas morning.
1,Uninspiring,"This novel was very bland and uninspiring. Both this book and the author's last- My Intended, seem to be a way for the author to complain about different aspects of their personal life. It makes the story just sad and also shows a lack of imagination."
4,packer backer,"Good value for the money. Assembly took about 2 hours. Looks good and is fairly sturdy. The woodgrain finish is not very thick and scratched with a heavy TV on it. Looks nice from about 2 feet and further away, from a distance you can't tell it is vinyl covered particle board. Not a high end piece of furniture but serves the pupose well."
5,Just Right!,This tv stand is just beautiful and great for the corner of my dining room. It did not take long to fix which is a good thing. It is worth the money!
1,No Compromise,"We bought this devotional book because my daughter loved One Life, also by Jim Burns. Imagine our surprise to find that the books are EXACTLY THE SAME! Buy one or the other, definitely, but not both!"
5,Great Resource,"The book is very well written. Attention to technical accuracy as well as the methods used to present the information make the book a very good resource. The author goes through the details of soil testing, monitoring, and analysis types and explains how each applies directly to the results of landslide/soil stability in a way I have not seen in any other reference that I have read. Graphics, figures, tables, etc. are well thought out and usefull. Case histories are used to explain many of the important issues. If you are a geotechnical engineer involved in slope stability problems I would definately recommend it."
3,generic information,"Perhaps it is because I already have a basic knowledge of the positive effects of Kava that I was unimpressed with this book. I didn't feel that it gave anything above and beyond the general information that has been accessible for years. It seemed redundant. However, if you are new to the researching of Kava and its benefits, this book is a fine place to start."
5,Mysterious Island,This is the original soundtrack at a good price.Glad to add this gem to my collection.
5,Finest of it's type!,If you are into the Surf Rock genre then this is some of the best you can find. A bit sleepy and ethereal but near technically perfect.
4,Very good choice,This cd is awesome..It has some of the best tracks being listened all around the clubs.Especially the title album track is all the money...
3,Would be better with pictures.,"As a very visual person and having purchased Lee Bailey's cook books in the past, I was disappointed that this cook book was not like the others inasmuch as it does not include pictures of the food for the recipes included. If pictures are not important to you then this is a great cook book for you!"
3,"A bit smaller than I expected, but an okay item.","A bit smaller than I expected, but an okay item. If I had to order a similar item, I would spend a little extra on something that was larger, but you get what you pay for."
3,Not up to par with the Nightside novels,"I have to say that I've read lots of the stuff by Simon Green but this one was just not up to snuff. Unfortunately, I found myself getting bored with this one as the pacing is really slow until you're 1/2 way through the book. I thought it was still a fun read but it's just off. It seems like this was the transitional novel to get to the Nightside series. Some of the descriptions of the characters living in the other world become more fleshed out ideas in Nightside.It's a decent read but I wouldn't be in too much of a rush."
3,"nothing special, might have led to better sequels","Not sure what came first, this or Gaimen's NEVERWHERE.From a reader's standpoint, NEVERWHERE came first for me, so I rolled my eyes a bit at how Midnight Wine got started.The pacing is what I've grown to expect from being a fan of the Nightside series.Let's walk around and visit with lots of entities, without spending too much time on them, to figure out what's going on, and then have a climatic battle scene to resolve the storyline.That works for me, for the most part, with the Nightside series. Not so much for this stand alone novel.It's ending makes me think that author was using this story to introduce a bunch of characters, for further use in subsequent books in a series. He certainly didn't spend too much time fleshing them out in this one.Still, it wasn't terribly written, or painfully dull.It simply wasn't as good as some of his other work; it read like he didn't spend much time or effort on it, and did not resonate with me as a result."
3,More Y A than anything else,"Entertaining, simple, not quite the same detailed characters ai the nightsid e books. An extended fairytale rather than a whole book."
3,Super Reader,"As it turns out, I had read this, just didn't remember the author.A bloke working in an eclectic bookshop follows the wrong woman off the train, and ends up in Mysterie.Angels, a low-rent version of Thor, Luna, Gaia, Nichols Hob the Serpent's Son and others are there to help and bedevil him.A few names dropped from the Nightside, too, it seems, along with Hob.Basically, he becomes an important mortal element in a struggle between Powers and Dominations as Green likes to call them."
2,"Hawk and Fisher, where are you?","Didn't really care for this. I really prefer the Haven/Hawk&Fisher books. The story dragged, the characters talked too much, and the ending felt rushed. For all of the 'end of the world is at hand' I didn't really feel any tension or threat from this story."
5,A strong fantasy world,"Toby is a local bookstore clerk until he follows a beautiful woman through a rainstorm and into another world. From that point on he encounters Death, serpents, bad trolls and all manner of oddities which ultimately challenge him to rethink his world and life. A strong fantasy world."
4,"Not Ripe Yet, Still a Bit Green","I like Green's baroque visual imagination-- his description of Angel would probably cause Lovecraft to chew up a copy of his ""Collected Works"" in envy. Not a squamous or rugous part in sight. But once Green has created these imaginative creatures he is not sure what to do with them other than have them pound someone into the ground or be pounded into the ground by another character.The frame work of this book is familiar-- think A Fish Dinner in Memizon by E. R. Eddison and all of the other more modern authors mentioned by the other reviewers-- and Green draws on British legend and history in a way that is vaguely reminiscent of a lot of British writers. But the mind does tend to wonder a bit between acts of mayhem. And isn't the conclusion just a bit too pat?No matter, this one is worth a read and maybe if you are intrigued there is a whole world of British fantasy to explore that is not LotR or Harry Potter."
2,A comic book without the pictures,"If you bought this book based on the rear cover summary, you're in for a surprise...and not a pleasant one. Instead of the expected semi-serious (or at least moderately dignified) literary excursion, you're treated to a tossed salad of comic-book style action, a jumble of confused and reused mythology, and heaping helpings of lowbrow humor. Toby, our protagonist, is the only character above the level of cardboard, and he simply alternates between a desire to fall in love and a fear of farting in public. I'd excuse it all if the jokes were at least funny, but they mostly set your teeth on edge.If you're the sort of person who finds nothing strained in Norse gods ""getting with modern times"" by becoming private eyes, and considers the characterization of Satan as a handsome, oily-tongued rogue in a three-piece suit as ""new and refreshing"", then you'll probably adore this book. If not, you'll have a hard time even finishing it."
1,"Interesting concept, but seriously flawed execution","I picked out this book because the premise sounded interesting and I was looking for a light, enjoyable read; I couldn't have picked a worse book.The prose is painfully repetitious. Green seems to think that his readers can't remember basic plot points or character background for more than ~10 pages. The characters themselves are cute and funny, but barely one dimensional. The dialog is unnatural with many illogical jumps just to further the plot.For anyone who enjoys a good story with quality writing and characterization, don't bother buying this book."
3,From a Fly on the Wall,"I have read most of Bukowski,love Mickey Rourke as an actor and live about three miles from where the action in the film takes place (San Pedro along Pacific Ave). For me this movie can't lose,right?Wrong. Rourke does Bukowski sounding like W.C. Fields. While Faye Dunaway is really good, the movie grinds and lurches from one depressing scene to another, kind of like a drunk on a bingeon skid row. (Maybe that was the point). I guess I was hoping for a little more of Bukowski's insights on the human condition (he was one heck of an amateur psychologist on relationships) and a bit more nuance from Rourke.Glad I saw it once and satisfied my curiosity but I wouldnt go back there."
1,please kill me,this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it was a total waste of my time. please someone kill me for i have seen pure evil and i am now tainted from this stupid movie
1,Do not buy this version! Wait for a better release!,"I bought this DVD and it is an AWESOME movie, but the DVD I got was from Greece or something. The quality was VERY poor and did no justice to the movie. My old VHS copy is better! When is someone going to re-release this DVD as a special edition or director's cut??? It's a shame we can't get a better quality version of this movie!"
2,WHY??,"Mickey Rourke plays a Los Angeles bum who also writes poetry (it's about the real life Charles Bukowski, whose short story this is based on). He hangs out in a gin mill and gets beat up a lot. A rich publisher tries to get him onto the ""right"" track, even falls for him a little, but he won't have any of it. The movie is pretty downbeat and unenjoyable, though Rourke and his skidrow moll Faye Dunaway act it out fairly well. It's just by the end - who cares?"
4,"We're all ""somethingfly's""","When I first saw this film at age 17 I was not familiar with the writings of Buk but had learned some about his life via the publicity for the film. The film is beautifully executed, and as some other reviewers at this forum have alluded to, it's not exatly mainstream American entertainment. Look, Buk was a specific type, with a specific lifestyle, he happened to be tough enough and talented enough to make great art from it. We should all be so talented no matter what kind of life we lead. Rourke is a revelation and Dunaway is perfect as his tainted love. Watch, don't judge and you'll feel some universality of the vibrations of being alive --Unless you're dead in the heart,head and crotch, then fukyas anyways!"
4,WHY IS THIS FILM OOP? DVD RELEASE NEEDED IN THE U.S.!,"It's been a while since I last saw this film and I remember liking it a lot! The DVD has gone out of print(OOP) and it's a shame that so many people will miss seeing this interesting and gritty film. Rourke gives a memorable perfomance in this tale of booze and should-a"", ""would-a"",""could a's"". I would have to see it again before I could give it an honest rating, but it is certainly worth a new DVD release. ""I could have beaten him if I had eaten a sandwich!"" Please re-release this film on DVD!"
4,Humanity and Catfights,"A story of the below the normal. Drunks, to be exact. Great acting, though, and very believable characters. The catfight is more than worth the price of the movie, and Faye Dunaway is brilliant, whether drinking, philosophizing or ripping Alice Krige's hair out. Definitely worth seeing."
5,Nothing beats watching this movie with a beer,"If you like Bukowski. Watch this movie. If not don't even bother. If you have no clue who bukowski is, go visit the book section of this store and order Betting on the Muse and all your questions will be answered. If you ever wanted to enter the dark shadowy world of bars, brawls and Bukowski, this is the movie for you."
2,Read the book about the making of the movie instead,"Bukowksi's book (""Hollywood"") about the making of Barfly is infinitely better than the movie. And the movie is most certainly not worth $40, maybe I'd pay $5 for it in a bargain bin somewhere."
4,"Take Henry's hand, have a beer, and enjoy the ride","Anyone who enjoys Bukowski will enjoy this movie. You must have a sense of humor and a slighty tainted view of the world to love it as much as I do!! I think of it as a sort of drunken ballet.Perhaps because I am young I believe that everyone has a ""henry"" in them somewhere. Henry may never introduce himself to their reality, but he's there. The cynic, the one dangerously close to the edge. Watch the movie and don't take it too seriously. If you do...you might find it terribly depressing. Enjoy the mad dance of life and have a cold one!!!"
1,DVD will not play....wrong DVD region,I purchased this item recently and was extremely disappointed to learn that it was actually from Austrailia and will not work in my DVD player or PS3 gaming consul. I am troubled by the fact that Amazon did not inform me by product description that the item I was purchasing would be not compatable with my United States DVD region equipment.
1,all regions my eye!,"The DVD didn't work for me either. Tried 5 DVD players, different brands, new and used. Save your money until theu release a US specific disc."
3,A portrayal of L.A. seediness...,"Being a huge Bukowski fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Mickey Rourke makes for a good, sloppy drunk and Faye Dunaway is perfect as his female counterpart. Extremely humorous--especially Mickey's dialogue with Frank Stallone's character, a macho blockhead bartender. A lot of fun, but very black."
1,DVDS FAULTY..HORRIBLE,"I BOUGHT THE BARFLY DVD MOVIE...DVD QUALITY IS TERRIBLE,..CANT WATCH MOVIE BECAUSE A TRACKING TYPE LINE HAS RUINED THIS ENTIRE MOVIE .....LOOKS LIKE ALOT OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM ......WELL MONEY WASTED AGAIN ON SOME INTERNET CRAP....PROBABLY OVERSEAS ................................................................................................................................"
1,Barfly pirated copy,I was disappointed that I was unable to play my new copy of Barfly on my newer DVD players because they would not play an unauthorized copy. I was totally unaware that this copy was not an original copy. Buyers beware of buying copies. They may not play on your DVD player.
1,Bad Copy,"Stay away from this product. The movie is great, but this DVD is unwatchable on most players. I can't speak for the other Barfly versions, but this one is no good."
5,"My favorite movie, ever!","I'm not saying it's the greatest movie ever made (for my money, that's Casablanca) but it is my personal favorite. I've seen it a hundred times or more and it never gets old. The first time I saw this film was a few weeks after it was released when my then-girlfriend, a couple of buddies of ours and I jumped in the car in Lexington, KY, and drove to New York just so we could see Barfly. We saw it in a little theatre in the Village and I'm here to tell you that it was worth the trip.Bukowski rules! Barfly is a great American film."
3,I like this movie,"I like this movie, but it wouldn't play on my bluray player and I had to watch it on the computer,would be a lot more satisfied if I could play it on the bluray"
1,dvd,"First time using Amazon. Rec'd Barfly as a regular DVD...not Blue Ray...doesn't work in my DVD player....says ""wrong DVD"". Had a friend try it in their Blue Ray...same thing. Tried it in my kitchen TV/DVD...worked, but it's only a 10 inch screen. Live and learn...don't buy DVDs online."
4,Lightening FAST ship for this great film,"This is a great film. i still have the VHS version. I ordered the DVD, Amazon shipped super fast. although the first one didn't play. must be the old version verses newer modles. i print out the shipping lable and within hours my status shows another being shipped out to me. I shipped the other one back following day of printing return lable and sure enough the second one was here like withing two days of that. This one works just fine. it is an old film and filmed before HD was a word. You can only do so much to polish (a)an (old film) But i was amazed how good the color is and how sharp the picture is. No problems what so ever. That was the fastest ship out/receive return ever. thanks Amazon."
2,Old DVD Format - Beware,"I was unable to play this on a new BluRay player because it would not recognize the disc, I had to pull out a 10 year old DVD player from the closet in order to view.I had looked forward to watching this movie for years and was unable to since Netflix doesn't own copies. When I finally viewed it I was very under-whelmed, I suppose I was hoping for too much. Faye Dunaway is tremendous, but the constant boozing and fistfights didn't seem like too much of a stretch for Mickey Rourke to play so it was hard to judge his acting in the film. Overall the performances were very good, but the film itself was a scattered, self-indulgent mess."
3,Slightly disappointing portrayal of a great artist,"This isn't a poor film by any means, but I was disappointed in it. As a huge fan of Charles Bukowski, I just didn't feel that it reflected all the humor, desperation, sensitivity and everyday tragedy of his novels and stories. Mickey Rourke's performance wasn't awful, but it seemed a little forced and awkward. Faye Dunaway, however, is excellent as Hank's (aka Charles') nihilistic, alcoholic girlfriend. Overall, though, I suppose when I feel the need to visit Bukowski's world, I'll stick with his stories."
5,A Powerful Showcase for Rourke and Dunaway,"In ""Barfly"" (1987), the breakfast of champions is scotch and water. That's how life is for the poetic skid-row drunk from Los Angeles. Mickey Rourke delivers a beautifully realized performance as Henry Chinaski - the alter-ego of poet Charles Bukowski (who wrote the screenplay based on his own experiences). The unkempt actor has the time of his life as a philosophic survivor whose pain and misery are revealed in his poetry. ""Barfly"" is a world-weary mixture of humor and reality without self-pity. Directed with gritty authenticity by Barbet Schroeder, viewers can experience the empty glasses, burned-out cigarettes and dark booths that inhabit the seedy tavern atmosphere. Apart from being a powerful showcase for Rourke's talents, the film also represents Faye Dunaway's finest work in recent years as Wanda - a dedicated barfly who becomes Chinaski's soulmate. The chemistry between the leads is letter-perfect."
5,worth it for one great line (and then some)!,"""its not that i don't like people...its just that i like them better when they're not around."" Spoken like Snagglepuss that line sums up the movie in a nutshell (along,of course, with ""drinks, for all my friends"". First saw this movie when it was released. My friends then spent the next six months reciting lines from memory. Fun, great flick."
3,Hard to find a PAL player,Barfly (1987) (PAL/Region 0)The service was fast and the discription of the DVD was accurate so absolutely no problems with the seller. Problem is that I didn't know I couldn't play this DVD on my NTSB (American standard) player and finding a PAL player to dub a viewable copy is not easy. It would have been helpful to mention this and not just that the product was PAL. To the average person that doesn't warn of the problem.
2,Size is now 8.25 oz not 17 oz,"Thymes no longer makes this product in a 17 oz version, yet the Amazon description shows this as 17 oz and the sellers selling this (I ordered from both) are selling the 8.25 oz. I've contacted Amazon twice about this and they will not change the product description. Buyer beware, this is 8.25 oz product, not 17 oz.As for the soap, we love the scent, nice and light, but very refreshing and reminds us of Christmas. I give the soap itself 5 stars, but give Thymes, Amazon, and the sellers here 1 star for deception (not intentional deception, but still deception)."
1,The thymes Frazier hand wash-17 fl. Oz.,I did noT like this provider.I had ordered 2 17fl.oz. Bottles of this hand soap and they sent me 2 bottles of 8.25 fl. Oz.of soap.I would not recommend this seller because of their lack of ability to provide a correct description of the product they are selling.
5,Smells Like Christmas,"I love this handwash. It has a definite, but not annoyingly strong, fragrance. I love the large size since there are 5 of us in the house. Try it--it smells nice."
4,Palace was a refreshing drama for me,"I must say that this drama was well done. The main female lead didn't come off as ""strong"" and ""I can do anything"" sort of way. And the supporting female character, I felt was not annoying or too obtrusive (much like most of them are made out to be). The acting was superb and things ranging from the costumes, settings, and music kept me intrigued in the series the entire time. Another note I'd like to add (for my own satisfication), I strongly felt that the supporting male character was much more deserving of the lead actress. But, alas, like any typical Korean drama, this is never the case. The lead male and female must always come together. This is a must see for anyone interested in seeing the lives of rich people, figureheads of a country, and such; and the many things they must go through to maintain what they have."
1,"I ordered this and got a totally different item, I feel violated!","I ordered the special edition you see pictured here, but what I got was something totally different. Sad thing is I cant translate Korean and the package states to read warning label before opening.. and I cant. all I know is that the package I recieved is not this item I thought I was getting. I cant even find the box I recv'd today in the product link. I will never order from this merchant( The Rolling Donut) again. Took 2 weeks and 1 day to receive my package. ( Im so sad)"
1,Sorry but not worth the money,This is nothing more than the national enquirer of chess. I find this book in poor taste and lack of what I was looking for. I find the title insulting and the content of the book even more boring. She jumped from one story to another without specific ideas. She's a very good player but this book failed to live up to the hype. She could have done much better. I certainly enjoyed her articles in chess life a lot better than this book. [...]
5,Fun Book,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a fun blend of history, personal experiences, and provacotive ideas. It's cool to see someone make chess edgey, and exciting. Probably not a book to buy if you want to learn the intricacies of the Sicilian Dragon, but a great book if your chess interests are broader than just the game itself."
2,Nice job,I like Jennifer's book a lot. She did her research and gave a very candid view about women's chess. The reason why I gave this a 4 star and not 5 is there're some factual errors. The most glaring one is Judit Polgar did play in women's tournaments after the 1990 Olympiad. She competed in the 1992 Women's World Rapid and Blitz Championship but did not win. You can find this fact at the Judit fan club website. There are a few other minor ones but overall it's a good book. This is a well done job by Jennifer.
1,Inexcusable title,Ms. Shahade is a scholastic chess teacher. She claims to want to help young girls in chess. This is not the way to do it. It's inexcusable to have a book with such a title. I'm extremely disappointed with her decision to abandon the children. There're also countless errors with information. Very bad decision.
2,Crazy stuff,"It's disappointing to see so many fake reviews giving this book 5 stars. It's equally disappointing to see many people bashing it without giving it a chance. This is not a great book. It's not even a good book. However, it's an entertaining book. If you like chess gossips or trashy novels, this book is it. If you're looking for a chess book, this one is not for you. The author still needs work on her writing skills. Too raw for now."
1,The most twisted book,"The author made many of her subjects look very bad from Krush, Vicary, Kosteniuk, Polgar, Gaprindashvili, Crotto to Savereide, etc. Her view about promoting chess and women's chess is completely twisted. Stay as a feminist if you wish but stay away from chess. This is an embarrassment to the chess community for a few bucks. As a chess player, the author supposed to know how to think ahead. The author didn't. She didn't care about the feelings or welfare of her colleagues. She's out to get fame and fortune and disregard everyone else. Shame on you! You're no role model for me!"
4,"Entertaining, Enlightening, One persons point of view, Not always on point","One thing cannot be denied about ""CHESS BITCH"" - it is entertaining. For both women and men this book has some eye opening information. Perhaps, at certain points not historically accurate, but putting this aside the point of view of the author is interesting to say the least. Complaints about the title - well certainly this book was not intended for children and the title tells you that. It is a book for the mature reader.I liked it!"
3,Stop the insanity please,How can people give this book 5 stars or 1 star? Can people please give real reviews and ratings for once? This book is an enjoyable read. Ms. Shahade made it interesting. It also has a lot or errors and some problems with style. The title is of course questionable. I like Ms. Shahade a lot. I played a simul game against her last year. She's nice but I think she made a mistake with the title. The bottom line is it's a good book but not 5 stars or 1 star. Grow up people.
2,"Interesting topic, poorly written","I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I must say that I'm disappointed. There're plenty more exciting women chess characters out there. Shahade could have done a much better job with her selection.It's nice to read about Savereide and Crotto. My understanding of Shahade's assessment of Kosteniuk as an self-centered ego maniac / gold digger who married a much older control freak is right on. That's about the best part of the book. Her assessment of others are not deep enough. She should have gone a lot deeper.Shahade's writing is not smooth. It could use little more polishing. This book is too ambitious for a first book and she missed the mark. Therefore, I give two stars."
1,I do find the book's title odd,"I do find the book's title odd, given that most female players (Miss Shahade included) would be offended at somebody calling them ""bitches"". I certainly never thought of Miss Shahade as a ""bitch"". The title is just a silly, immature idea. Nobody in chess circles call female players of any strength ""bitch""; I have no clue as to where Silman or Shahade got the idea from, but it was not chess, that's for sure."
1,Low values,"I don't understand the main idea behind this book. Is it to promote women's chess or is it to promote feminism and trashy values? Yes, there're some history of women's chess in this book. However, it also contains a lot of Ms. Shahade's personal feminist views. It would be naive to believe that the rest of America would agree with Ms. Shahade. It would be naive to believe that most of the female chess players in the 70's and 80's are lesbians as claimed by Ms. Shahade. This is the sort of outrageous opinion that makes this book somewhat like the Jerry Springer show with a touch of Howard Stern. I will never read anything else by Ms. Shahade again. I don't appreciate her style and poor values."
1,Way below expectation,"I was expecting a lot more from this book. Unfortunately, it's nothing like I had anticipated. Shahade is a creative writer. However, that alone can't carry this book. The researches were very poorly done. She made too many assumptions based on her narrow view instead of stating things as they are. It's truly a big disappointment."
2,Not a bargain - Not worth the price,"It's unfortunate that Ms. Jennifer is portraying her friends Krush, Vicary and Kournikova wannabe in very poor fashion. She also made far too many errors in this book. She's a good loud spoken feminist but a very poor writter. There're some decent parts in the book but few and between. That's why I'm giving it this rating."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book with great expectation. I must say that I'm disappointed. The writing is fine but the chapters are so disorganized. Jennifer jumped from one place to another. It is almost impossible to follow. In addition, I feel that there're just too much speculations. It seems like the same style of writing as in chess gossips. I was expecting something much better and classier. She's a good player but her writing is not nearly in the same level. This is something I would expect from a HS student, not a serious author."
1,Many problems with the book,"The big problem with this book is the poor choice of title and the amateurish cover that makes it look silly. Other problems are that it unfortunately isn't well organized and not particularly well written.The history sections are good but flawed. The fact that some were published as standalone articles does result in too many repetition of material. It is very disturbing to start a new chapter and then read almost verbatim some material you just completed.Also poorly done is the bias look at some of the modern players she knows, including her friends, showing their bad points including some very odd ideas some of them have. Her friends are made out to be sex maniac, self-centered shopping queen and Anna Nicole Smith who married for wealth and fortune.Overall, the book is perfect for the liberal left wing feminists. On the other hand, it's not recommended for the rest. You'd be blacklisted and laughed at if you publish a book like this in some serious chess country."
1,The most unusual chess book ever,"I can't believe the title when I first saw it. I was asking myself how could any woman write a book with this title? This book is similar to the style of B... magazine. I'm also very disappointed in how WGM Kosteniuk and WGM Krush are being portrayed. They are much nicer than the way they are described in this book. Mrs. Shahade is making WGM Kosteniuk look like fame and fortune seeker by marrying someone who is old enough to be her uncle and IM Krush look like an airhead selfish shopaholic. It's very disappointing to see how the author describes other female players. The oddest part is when the author talks about her attraction to her female opponents. Is this a coming out of the closet book? Very strange, the strangest chess book ever."
1,Twisted views,"It's important to point out that, even in chess circles, the word bitch has never been used in a positive manner, and the (chess piece) queen has never been alluded to as a ""bitch"", as the publisher claims. Perhaps people not familiar with chess circles can buy into those silly arguments, but us real chess players (yes, I'm a chess player) know better than that.It's quite naive of anyone's part to try to justify the use of the word ""bitch"" as something other than an ill-advised attempt at drawing some attention to the book. In spite of the author (and Silman's) twisted explanations trying to present the word bitch in a positive light, the reacrtion is a natural one: no english-speaking person can point to an instance of the word ""bitch"" used in a non-pejorative way.The book itself is not interesting to people who are non feminist."
1,Poor taste. Bad example. Shameful.,"This book is in poor taste. Beside the hype, there's nothing else in it that is worth reading. Two thumbs down."
1,Ridiculous book - Very poor work,"This book is utterly ridiculous. Shahade doesn't seem to know where to go with this book. It has to be one of the most unorganized books. It totally lacks focus. This isn't about history of women's chess. It's about the dirt of some women players according to Shahade. The quality of the writing is extremely poor. Most of her subjects are not so interesting. Oh, and what about the dozen errors with chess facts? It seems that Shahade is clueless and was too lazy to double check her stuff. If you like sex and gossip, buy this book. If you like a good chess book, this is not the one. And no children under 15 should read this book. I was quite offended by this book. The title is also in poor taste. Yes, I'm a USCF rated OTB chess player."
2,"Facts are facts-- there are fewer smarter women than smart men, unfortunatley","Most women cannot compete with men in chess on equal footing. Sure, there are some very smart women out there, but fewer than smart men. The IQ distribution for women is narrower than for men. Meaning there are fewer women geniuses, but also fewer women idiots. (See the research of Prof. Camille Benbow of Vanderbilt U.) That's why women chess players do not compete in men's championships. There are 1,300 male chess grandmasters worldwide, but only 13 women. (That's why the Chess Federation came up with a special rank, WGM-- Woman Grandmaster. Not equal to GM.)This book tries to go around this basic fact. Unfortunately it cannot.Do not misunderstand-- I'd love to have more really smart women around. I love really smart women; but unfortunately they are not that many. Certainly not as many as smart men. Perhaps they do deserve a chess book of their own. But this is not one such."
1,Prove it!!,If women are the equal or the superior of men in chess-then prove it over the board. Look at the record of J. Polgar against the likes of the top 10. It proves she can almost play with the best. But where are the rest of the women? It is not in the female nature to play a mans game and the lack of strong females at the top reflects this truth of nature.
5,Perfect,I had to order this paper for a photography class I was taking at school. I've ordered Ilford paper before and loved the finished prints so it was no surprise I received the same great quality this time. The pearly finish is lovely and gives my final images a nice satin look.
2,The Borreguita and the Coyote,"I so wanted my children to like this book. The artwork is attractive and I like to expose them to literature from other cultures, but they just did not take to it.Although the story is fresh and has its amusing side, my son would just wonder away and no one (either the 3 y.o. nor the 5 y.o.) asked for it to be read again, even after multiple readings. (I don't assume that they will take to a book the first time.) Further, my daughter, who is the sensitive sort, was bothered by the fact that the coyote wanted to eat poor little borreguita.We love ""Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain"" by Verna Aardema but that book has more of a rhythmic cadence that this book lacks and perhaps that is why it was not a hit in my house.That said, you can see from the other reviews that other children loved it. And it is not that this is not a good book, but if your children are like mine you just might want to try it out at the library first."
2,What was the author thinking?,"I am an Electronics Engineering student and was very dissatisfied with this text. The chapters were written well and were not too hard to understand, but the examples and questions at the end of the chapters were often totally unrelated to the readings. I often found myself very confused and frequently wondered what the author was thinking when he wrote this book. It was even more frustrating to find that the professor couldn't even explain many of the questions at the end of the chapters. This book is not a helpful means of learning physics and should be avoided at all costs if possible."
1,I have to give it one star?,"This book is bad. I mean really bad. My IQ has gone down significantly after two long, torturous semesters using this book. When I was in high school, physics was a reasonably enjoyable experience. Now, I would rather ingest a suppository than read this book. If any poor student is required to use this book, then I would make sure that he already has an Einstein-ish knowledge of the subject."
5,A haunting film!,"This has to me one of my favorite movies of all time. The story line tugs at your heart strings, and the acting is superb. It has to be one of the best character studies I've ever seen! Elmer Berstein's score is haunting. Check out the scene when Deborah Kerr and Bert Lancaster are in the park, and listen to the music. If you don't feel a wave of nostalga sweep over you, you must not have a heart!"
2,D851,"D851 was my expert skydiving license number.From a techincal aspect i found it boring.Of all the great movies Burt Lancaster and Deborah KERR made as a team and individually,i felt this was closing the curtin on two GREAT careers.I would have elected to have had retired while on top."
2,I hated this silly movie,"This glorified soap opera is a waste of a great cast. What other reviewers call ""spare dialog"" I call unnaturallly long pauses between phrases, especially on the part of Lancaster and Kerr.The plot seems to revolve around how these professional skydivers are afraid to jump out of planes and sometimes forget to pull their rip cord (I kid you not).There are some swell aerial scenes at the beginning and end, plus you get to see Deborah Kerr naked, but otherwise this movie is just awful."
1,Berware of spyware,"While I enjoyed the added mechs, this software and its counterpart clan arsenal contain the C-Dilla spyware. The Black Knight expansion pack also contains it. This is a copywrite protection program that installs on your machine and does not shut down after you exit the game. TurboTax also installs the program and the only way to remove it is to download and run the safecast uninstaller program from the intuit website. Including this program was a terrible thing for Microsoft to do, especially since it does not disclose the fact at any time."
5,Awesome!,"This is an ""expansion"" to Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance. Which is an awesome game as well. In this pack you get 4 new mechs,2 new maps to play in, and some other stuff. You can play MW4 online with other people. If you like the Mechwarrior Series, you'll like this game."
4,Its nice,"I have not had time to enjoy MW4 online with the pack, but I like what I have seen. I hope that MW5 debuts soon."
5,Great Unit,"This holster fit my phone perfectly, and cost far less than the Nokia version. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!"
5,Seems to work.,"I didn't try these myself...they were for my sister. Since she's taking so many supplements, it's hard to say which one or ones are helping her with memory problems. She is doing quite well with lithium aspartate, vinpocetine, etc."
3,does orotate or aspartate very bad ?,"Recent studies conducted by the University of Toronto found that orotic acid on its own promoted the formation of liver tumors in rats.

3,steve madden pump purple,Very nice shoe but a little tight around the toes.Had to end up giving shoe away because I had alreadyworn them. Nice quality should though.
3,Real Basic,"this book provides basic information, many in California. I was a little disappointed but it did have some good local information."
5,A wonderfully entertaining read,"This book is full of charm, wit and excellent writing. The characters are richly drawn, quirky and entertaining. Wesley has a way of pinning down the fine details of human behavior and showing them in a sympathetic but humorous light. Poppy's vacillations are completely understandable and her struggles to get herself unstuck from a bad relationship are tragic yet funny. Wesley gives her characters the kind of dignity that makes us love them, even when they are not being very loveable. This is the mark of a great writer."
4,Mmmmm,"Although this isn't quite as good as Midwinter of the Spirit, still Phil Rickman doesn't disappoint with his tasteful suspense and his exquisite prose. I am exceptionally pleased to see that these books are now offered in the United Sates. BOUT TIME!"
4,Impressions of life,"[Four and a half stars] Whether the portrait of a marriage or the panorama of a Zeitgeist, this rich and luminous picture is painted in short impressionistic strokes that dissolve continuity and show Salter as the miniaturist par excellence. Months pass, sometimes years; characters come and go virtually unannounced; a brief observation, a tiny anecdote, can illuminate entire lives. Viri (Vladimir), a New York architect, and Nedra, his wife, lead an apparently idyllic existence in their house by the Hudson, surrounded by friends, children, and pets. But even such happiness is not complete. As they move into affairs, the rhythm of yearning pulls each in different directions, strengthening one and devastating the other. But even as the story moves beyond their inevitable (but amicable) divorce, it continues to hold them in that web of desolation and surprising beauty which has characterized this exquisitely-written book from the beginning."
4,A lightly woven filigree of regret.,"Much less of a story than a lingering retrospective gaze at the subtle astonishments that have come to populate a life, giving it the plenitude towards which it has helplessly striven and at which some believe it finally arrives -- if ever it should -- only upon its end. Salter has, in 'Light Years,' nicely captured a sound style of elegantly succinct memorial in which the sensuous swells with sadness."
2,ghost characters,"Salter's poetic prose at times reads too precious. Characters come and go, are left behind- vanish, in a picaresque of loss and despair. What kept me reading was Salter's evocative description of place. He has the ability to distill the essence of geography with the skill of a cartographer while holding fast to the invisible details that bring a terrain to life. Perhaps I am faulting Salter for the book he in fact aimed to write. Light Years is about what the poet John Ashberry calls ""time's silent roar"" and its indifference to all within earshot of its muted din. Salter's vaporous characters inhabit a ghost-like nether world intimating with each jaded aside: ""We are here only for so long, and there's not a damn thing we can do about it."" They remain on the page, never jumping full to life- obscure, shadowed, and with the pall of death lingering over them like a coming storm."
4,Beautiful novel,"A wonderfully-written, poignant portrait of a marriage. The end filled me with sadness and the chapters were consistently memorable. Salter is a miniaturist -- that is, he very effectively evokes isolated scenes with memorable details -- but he manages to convey time's passage as well. Salter has to be one of the top English stylists of the century. I marked the novel down one star only because I thought the fate of one of the central characters was not believable."
5,Poetry in prose,"Not a traditionally told story, the plot is almost entirely incidental. What we are left with is the language, lyrical and beautiful, that can veer from a description of a family to spoons in a drawer, and make it seem like a logical extension of a house and its inhabitants."
2,Who cares?,"I admire James Salter's Hemingway-styled sentences, or sentence fragments. They are pointed and powerful. They tell you a lot in a very few words, just like Papa did. The only problem I have, and it's a big problem, is that I don't give a hoot about his characters. They are a bunch of upper middle class snobs whose only problem is who is screwing who. They have nothing to overcome except their own pettiness and their stupid lives. Maybe that's Salter's point, but it is not interesting. Of course I may be jaundiced because I have been reading Toni Morrison and Erskine Caldwell and Richard Wright, whose characters were trying to find something to eat or pay the rent. These people had real problems. If you read a book just for the writing then Salter is your man, but if you want characters you care about, then skip this crap,unless you're a snob yourself.Ed Arnold"
3,More for the *OLD* Collection?,"This DVD is yet another part of the *OLD* collection. If you've been collecting them all along, buy it.BUT... You may also be interested in the plans to release ""Deluxe"" boxed sets for each season. For what it's worth, they had things pretty much under control when they started. They released the first 6 DVDs with numbers from 1-6... pretty simple, so why did they drop the idea of building a numbered set?I bought it, as I've bought every other SP DVD to date. It still drives me nuts that they're going to start all over again. This means most of the fans who bought the individual DVDs will end up buying it a second time."
3,not great,These are much smaller than I thought (although they measure exact to description). Backs are loose and post is very short.
4,nice buy,"the quelity is good it catches the light the gold has a rich gold look to it ,the claps should have been a little bigger"
4,No Fishy After-Taste,This brand of fish oil had previously been recommended to me by an accupunturist. I bought it from their office for almost twice the price. I also really enjoy the fact there is no fishy after-taste. You are just left with a hint of fresh citrus flavor.
4,This music makes the world smaller,"This unusual mixture of rock, pop, and klezmer music comes out as a healing force on the brink of new millenium. This is, in my opinion, a higly significant record. Heartwarming music that may contribute in healing the wounds brought on by this, the most voilent century in the history of human mankind. Thank You Channe Nussbaum and Spielnicks."
3,Use as directed ONLY.,"I'd give this another star, it's a very interesting artifact after all, but I'm afraid my review might be construed, as I'm afraid many readers are approaching this book the wrong way. It is not (nor is it intended to be) a just tuning reference book; it is instead a book about one man's personal musical odyssey: hence the title. If you use it to try to learn about just tuning in particular or tuning in general without already possessing a solid background in acoustics and the history of music theory, you will come away from it with a very warped viewpoint, and when you encounter those who do have a solid background in acoustics and the history of music theory you will embarrass yourself badly."
2,Not appropriate for middle school,"I am a middle school teacher and we read the biography of Matthew Henson in honor of African American heritage during February. The story was well written and fascinated my Florida-born students. When I previewed the movie, it was clearly not suitable for middle-school children as if very clearly showed the out-of wedlock realtionship of Robert Peary."
2,"I'm sorry to disagree, but...","This book reminded me of some of the better novellas written by my high school creative writing students over my 27 years of teaching. Characterization remains shallow, and description is often extraneous. The present tense narration doesn't work well for the story, as the action is described in a detached fashion, for the most part. Considering what she experiences, Kat is one cool female--too cool for me to believe in.Awkward sentences and occasional grammar lapses were disengaging, as well.I'm afraid I can't fathom any comparison to Crichton and other well-known writers here--other than the plot. It's a good plot. Politics, medicine, war, romance, murders, your typical best-seller plot elements are all here. The book is in need of major editing and revision, though, if it is to catapult the author to the level of other bestselling thriller writers."
3,Well written but very shallow,I usually dont read these books but since i was flying and i wanted something to read i picked it up. I was surprised that the book was quite well written but it was very very shallow. The people were just so obsessed with popularity.even in the end Andy's popular and shallow friends were more important to him than anything or anyone else.
5,First time viewer!,"Purchased this movie for my niece! She absolutely loved it! I knew she would, I have enjoyed watching this movie many times over."
5,how it was in the fifties,"i love this movie.purchased in 2006 before it got so expensive in DVD.a reflection of how gangs were in the 50's.lots of great diverse characters.action,love fights you name it."
5,WANDERERS FOREVER!!,"This is just a great film, and one that has become a huge cult hit. You don't need to be from the Sixties or from the Bronx to enjoy this movie, it just wreaks class! Phillip Kaufman really hit everything just right here - go and buy it now!! And if you still need a further reason - Karen Allen playing strip poker!!"
4,Wanderers rule!,"I loved this movie when I first watched in the early eighties. Gang members and fratmen can identify with most characters and groups portrayed in the film (Wanderers' leader Ritchie, strongman Perry, warmonger Joey, pathetically wimpy and psychologically disturbed Turkey, etc.). In a nutshell, an inter-racial conflict resolved through non-violent means (a football game!) with a climatic ""rumble"" uniting Italian, colored and Asian gangs. Fights scenes could have used more work, though (scenes in ""The Warriors"" and ""The Outsiders"" appeared better choreographed), but all-in-all a great movie with a memorable and nostalgic soundtrack (Four Seasons, Ben E. King, Dion, etc) to boot."
5,Must have cult classic...,I came across this movie by accident years ago on tv and fell in love...so I finally bought it and have watched it several times over now. If you like 1960's NY themed movies you will love this one! And you will love the music!
4,Very enjoyable,It's 1963 in the Bronx. There are gangs of teenage boys that's either/and by turf or ethnic group. The Wanderers are Italian. They were not like today's gangs. They fought mostly among other gang and hung out for fun. But it did get nasty between the Italians and the Blacks (the Del Bombers). And the Ducky Boys are pretty frightening. The Fordham Baldies look scary but their antics gave me a lot of laughs. I recommend this film even if you don't remember the early '60s. It's fast paced in general. This movie is pretty good fun. Half comedy and half drama. It has a great soundtrack if you like music from this era.
5,THOSE GUYS LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF PRICKS WITH EARS,"this has got to be one of the greatest gang movies ever made along with The Warriors. the best part of the movie is the big fight at the end in the football field. Joey's dad was kickin some major A** ! I like how all the gangs got together in the end to help each other out. Goes to show that in the end besides our differences, were all just a bunch of squirrels trying to get a nut. the soundtrack for this movie is off the hook too !"
4,The Wanderers,"Bought this DVD for my husband. He had been searching and searching for it in stores, when I found it on Amazon I immediately bought it. Great price - Received DVD in good condition. Husband absolutely loved it."
3,It Wanders,"You know what I like best about this movie? The opening shots of the Bronx accompanied by The Four Season's ""Walk Like a Man."" You have to see it to know what I mean... the rest of them movie is uneven, though it is worth watching to see a young Karen Allen and Ken Wahl. And, you know what strikes me as sort of funny? How the Four Seasons sing a song called ""Walk Like a Man,"" but they sing it in falsetto. Go figure."
1,Cult Classic - Bad Movie,"Everything from the acting to the plot, is really bad in this movie... I bought it out of the reviews I've read.. still I was very disappointed.."
5,!!Wow!!,This is a chart topper. Uncle Kracker has done a great job with this song. The alblum was set up good. This song will be one to stick around.
2,one song... on cd.,I am disappointed in this CD. Follow me- was the only song on the CD. It was my own fault for not paying attention when I ordered it. For the $12.00 I spent. I should have just downloaded the song for .99
5,Great,This song follow me means alot to me. I really enjoy it everytime I here it. The only bad thing is I can not find it in stores.
4,follow me by uncle kracker,i really liked this cd and i thnk everybody should buy it and if you already have it you should like it!
4,Breath of fresh air...,"This novel was truely a breath of fresh air. I am an avid reader and many books I read are so far off from real life. I truely enjoyed reading this book, beacuse it brings the reader back to reality. The characters are so life like that I could see the story unfolding in front of me. I read the book in two sittings (had to be at work early). I would recommend this book to EVERYONE!"
3,Not as good as Antichrist,"Buy Antichrist Superstar and avoid this unless you want to get it for Disposable Teens and Lamb of God. The heavy metal beats are alright on this CD, but most of the lyrics aren't up to par...Ach! Nicht so gut..."
4,Manson's best yet,"Marilyn Manson always manages to stir up controversey with his blazing industrial/metal tunes, but this is by far his best effort yet. While Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals were both good albums, Holy Wood is more polished and, dare I say it, more thought provoking than any of his previous efforts. One of the best albums of 2000."
5,HELL YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd is freakin awesome, i own mostly every Marilyn Manson cd and this one is by far my favorite. I love the stories he tells with these songs and they all have a heavy but creepy tone to the music. HELL YEAH MARILYN MANSON YOU RULE!!!!!!"
3,It is Manson at it again!,Manson is one of those it takes getting used to him. This like all the other Manson Cds I have I had to listen to a few times to get the punch of it. At first I thought this was total garbage and not his best but like all his others I thought that also and eventually turned out to like it for the most part. I do not agree with his views on God and politics and life but I didnt get this Cd to have something to differ on. Manson in his own freakish way is talented musically and the production is good. He doesnt really fit in any genre of metal or hard rock as most know it but can deliver the same with his style. This was not his best offering but one to still give a shot to anyway.
4,FIGHT...FIGHT...¡¡¡¡ FIGHT!!!!,"Manson did it Again, His song ""Disposeables Teens"" hooked me up, and i had to buy the cd, After listened, i can say "" The Fight Song"" ""D. Teens"" ""Burning Flag"" and some other songs are really good, i enjoy this cd a lot. But I still think ""Mecanichal animals"" is better. Go and Buy it this one anyway even if you are not Mnason's fan."
3,Good but not Great,"I confess that I was not a Marilyn Manson fan when I bought this album. However, as an open-minded individual I thought I'd give him a try. Well, guess what... it an't that bad. Sure Manson is dark and blatantly anti-religious; however, his grooves are often infectious. The song ""Love Songs"" is unbeleivably good... when Manson asks ""do you love your God?, guns?, government?"" it is truly stirring and it's what good rock and roll is all about.The down side is that album becomes ""samey"" by the end and some of it is down right childish and over engineered. Never-the-less, people who consider Manson to be little more than an unintelligent shock rocker are wrong. He is both articulate and calculating in his assault on the religious right, and kudos to him for that. It's good to have someone egging religious fanatics on. It exposes how ridiculous they can be."
3,Eh...,The beginning of Marilyn Manson's spiral downhill... a very weak album... I don't know what happened here... deffinitly preview it before buying... something I should have done before spending me heard-earned money on it...
5,My Trip to Holy Wood,"I bought Holywood yesterday and already I know the words to every song and can't stop singing. It is such a good cd. The Fight Song...that is one of the best songs that I have heard in a long time. I have all of Manson's other cds, but this is the first one that I have fallen in love with the same day as I bought it. Buy this!! Show America that Manson is here to stay. Let's make them number one!!"
5,A return to form for marilyn manson,"Marilyn manson has just released an incredible cd.This sounds more like the sound marilyn achieved on ""antichrist superstar"". ""Holy wood"" musically picks up where ""antichrist"" left off.I thought ""mechanical animals"" lacked the aggression of ""antichrist"".""Holy wood"" has plenty of aggression and plenty of attitude.The sound is incredible and the band sounds tighter than ever.If you really liked ""Antichrist"" then you will definitely like""Holy wood""."
5,From a monkey to a man EVOLUTION!!!!!,"This is my first Manson cd and it completely blew away my expectations. I used to think when he came out that he was a freak. As I matured and got more into Metal(I used to be in to rap but too much bling and repetive lyrics pushed me out fast!!!) I can listen to this cd from start to finish without skipping a single track. There are very few rap cd's that i ever could do that to (all eyez on me, marshall mathers lp,illmatic,36 chambers, and stillmatic being the exception)But anyways this cd is a must buy for any Manson fan or anyone wanting to get into metal. I also recently bought the Golden Age of Grotesque which is even better and shows sign of German metal (Ramenstein the one and only). My favorite tracks are #2,3,6,and 12 they are great to thrash too!! FIGHT!!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"On this album the king of Goth attempts to fuse his masterpiece Antichrist Superstar and his medicore Mechanical Animals. This is definitley one of my favorite CDs, almost all the tracks are worthy of praise. This is not quite as good as Anitchrist but its definiley worth your money if you enjoy Marilyn's albums. Highly Reccomended!"
3,HOLYCRAP!,"I know the title of this review is perhaps, slightly strong. Still, I am more than disappointed. I gave the album a 3 becuase is is worth a listen. I like a few songs off the album, but only about 3. Even so, three songs out of nineteen on an album is something you would come to expect from a one-hit-wonder band. Don't get me wrong, Holywood does have a few good tunes. Disposable Teens brings memories of the songs like Beautiful People back, which is great. The Nobodies, one of my personal favorite songs is great. Whether it's the lyrics, the beat of the song, or that dark feeling you get from it definitely rocks. Born Again is also a cool song. Burning Flag and Coma Black are good too. As for the rest,...there are powerful lyrics sure, but haven't we already heard this about a dozen times before. Besides the few good songs on this cd all you have left is a big, noisy record that made me wish he did stay Mechanical despite my hope for a hard, rock record."
5,Incredible!,"One of the best albums I've heard in a while. Very hard, very very ""Manson"". If you think of Manson and think ""Controversial lyrics about religion and government while being sung in a tortured but very beautiful voice"" then this album is what you think of. Maybe not his best release, but one of them, indeed."
3,not the best but worth buying,The Hollywood in the shadow of the valley of death cd is a decent cd but if your not a manson fan don't buy this cd to get into him. The cd is worth buying but its not mansons best cd. I have only had the cd for 3 days now and there are 2 songs so far I like a lot. They are Disposable teens and coma black. Im kinda worried that manson is loosing his touch. A coupla years ago he was everywhere but now you hardly hear about hi. Is this the end of Marilyn Manson? I hope not and im sure other people hope not too
5,AMAZING!.........POSSIBLY MANSON'S BEST!,"WOW! This CD is amazing! Holy Wood is possibly the best Manson CD yet! A must for all Manson fans. I picked it up the day it came out and have listened to it many times over. I loved it before the first song was even over, and it gets better every time!"
1,Whiny twit...,"This is probably the best comedy album out! Who could possibly take this whiny circus clown seriously? Your 15 minutes are up, Manson."
4,"Not bad, but...","Definitely not MM's best. That title for me personally is of course, Antichrist Superstar (my favorite because it is basically The Downward Spiral pt.II...) Holywood was still pretty MM heavy and not quite as pop/glam-goth as some of them were. Still recommended for fans of MM, NIN, and industrial goth in general, but only after you own Antichrist or Mechanical Animals."
4,Near perfection!,"This album was GREAT! Since ACS, Manson's been adding on ballads and softer songs. But Holywood adds a good blend. High moments: Disposeable Teens and The Death Song. Lower moments: President Dead and A Place in the Dirt. Unlike their predecessor NIN, Marilyn Manson (the band)has been making BETTER music as their career goes on. It's probably one of the most stateful albums of 2000-2001."
5,Do you love your Antichrist Superstar CD? Yeah!,"Listen to The Love Song and you'll be glad to have this album. ""Do you love your guns? God? The government?"" Wow, blew me away with that one. I remember reading an article in Rolling Stone by a guy who interviewed Manson while he was working on this album, and Manson was holed up in his home with guns and had gotten really dark (as opposed to a not-dark Marilyn Manson). It comes through in this CD. Antichrist is conceptual compared to HolyWood, which seems more ""real"" when I listen to it, but without any whining. If you like Antichrist Superstar, I doubt you'll find this album to be better, but it won't disappoint. If you think Mechanical Animals is a better CD than Antichrist Superstar, hmmm, I can't help you out here!"
3,A Little Disappointing...,"I'm a little new to Marilyn Manson music. This was my 3rd CD of him I ordered. So far, the only songs on here I like are 'The Fight Song' and 'Disposable Teens' Maybe in time, I'll grow to like the other songs. If you are a goth and love Marilyn Manson music, I'm sure you'll love HOLY WOOD (IN THE SHADOW OF THE VALLEY OF DEATH!!!)"
5,Wonderful,"This Album, is not music to me, it's a dream, a whirlpool of thoughts that help me understand the meaning of life. When I play each song, I get lost in a world of my own.Holy Wood truly stands on it's own. It's a new kind of music; it's a new kind of Art...Masterpiece..."
5,The best of Manson yet...,"This is the darkest album in the trilogy that is Marilyn Manson. Holy Wood's main message about the evolution of man, and revolution. The songs are brilliant, filled with rage that most Manson fans loved in ""Anitchrist Superstar"". Some Manson fans were disappointed with Manson's 1998 ""glam"" album ""Mechanical Animals"" (which I loved). In any case this is Manson back to his roots, and if you liked Antichrist Superstar, you will love Holy Wood."
2,What happened?,"This album changed my life. It made me realise that Manson is a POP band. I was a big fan of the previous 2 albums (Anti-christ + Mechanical Animals) but I'm sorry, I really don't get this...I know Manson's music has never really been about technical proficiency, but this is one of the blandest, most re-hashed so-called *metal* albums I've ever heard. There is nothing remotely original on offer here - especially when compared to previous albums. Also a lot of the grit and bite has been taken out and what you're left with is a safe, radio-friendly album that is frankly more pop than it is metal/alternative decent music. A real disppointment.Although if you're a *misunderstood* teen then I'm sure you'll love this.Living proof that style sells over substance.... And what a shame that is"
2,Has its moments...,"But is overall disappointing. Honestly, Manson's worst CD to date...that would explain why it is also the lowest-selling Manson CD to date too.ACSS, Mechanical Animals, or Portrait of American Family are much better choices."
2,same old same old,"pity poor manson,no really do the poor guy only has a few more years to try and shock and disturb us then thats it.you see goth metal is an endagered species it may not look like it now but it is,its riding on the crest of nu-metals wave but unfortuntly goth metal has failed to evolve so basicly what your hearing now is what was aound 10 years ago.it happened to grunge and so it will happen goth metal.so anyway onto the album well its another slice of mansons tried and tested goth metal,hes still singing about the same subjects he was when he started.disposable teens is reasonbly good but the rest just fall into goth dirge which ok if you like that sort of thing."
3,The Further Decline of Marilyn Manson,"Marilyn Manson was a phenomenon to be reckoned with. Musically, Manson is inferior to other contemporaries of his day (ie, Nine Inch Nails); however, they were overshadowed by the fact that Manson was more than a band: it was a statement perfectly crafted for alienated teens. Manson gradually transformed from a band with a message to a lifestyle with its very own 'poster band'. Manson reached his musical zenith with 'Antichrist Superstar' (his best album), and then declined with 'Mechanical Animals'. 'Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)', although better than 'Mechanical Animals', is still not Manson at his best. He seems to sacrifice the music for the concept behind the album. The album seems long drawn out, and some songs are extremely repetitive (ie, 'The Fight Song', 'Disposable Teens'). The best song on the album is probably 'Cruci-fiction in Space'."
2,In the shadow of the other albums...,"Holy Wood is definitely a much weaker album than its two predecessors, Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals. It's derivative of previous albums, and adds nothing in terms of advancing the band musically. Sure, it's fine if you're an obsessive fan with no sense of anything but Manson, but if you're looking for something with edge, look elsewhere.Lyrically, the album is mediocre. Sure, it's a given that Manson has little to offer lyrically other than hacking out basic rebellion memes, but at least the previous two albums had highlights. This album is aimed squarely at the teen market, and unashamedly so.Holy Wood is an album which exemplifies mediocrity. This is a clear indication that Marilyn Manson is following the tired path of churning units for the label."
5,Piece of art,I am not a Marilyn Manson fan....but i like his music since i heard HollyWood...its a really good album...and i recommend to all the persons who wanna listen some good rock..Manson is a rockstar indeed and it doesnt matter if he is a little bit weird...thats his buysness...
4,Fresh album lacking previous talent,"Lacking the previous magic expressed in Mechanical Animals by Brian Warner's alter ego, Holy Wood uses harder shock rock tactics to spread its message, giving a fresh new sound for die hard fans.Holy Wood is definately worth pulling out the wallet, it has my personal thumbs up."
5,"man, this is good","wow. before golden age of grotesque, i wouldn't have given this cd a second glance. all has changed now. this is probably the second best release (1st being the aforementioned GAOG). All the songs on here are good or better (except count to 6 and die, which kinda stank...oh well). ""disposable teens"", ""love song"", and ""the fight song"" are probably the most noteworthy tracks, but as i said before, they all rule. this one is much closer to the classic angry goth manson as opposed to the more glam rock sex obsessed manson we saw with mechanical animals. all in all, a very good buy."
4,A downfall from mechanical animals,When I first listened to holy wood I Realized that Antichrist superstar and mechanical animals are kind of combined on this album but it does have a few different songs like Godeatgod and Born Again. I Don't think Anything Manson can put out will be quite like M.A.
5,I think that Manson out did himself once again,"I think that this album is awesome. I especially love ""The Death Song, and King Kill 33. Manson has always successfullly been able to shock people with his abusing lyrics and controversial persona. I can relate to what he's trying to push through the media, I can relate to what he's trying to convey. I think that he's an excellent musician, and the important thing is that he does it with intelligence. His lyrics and everything that surrounds his personality are quite intriguing. This man knows exactly what he's doing and I give him all the credit for that. I personally think that MA was the best album he's ever done, but Holly Wood is good. I wonder what he'll conjure up next this year when he takes on Marquis de Sade and others. I no doubt know that he will definitely create something beautiful and intelligent, like him."
5,MANSON,"THIS CD IS EXCELLENT!IT'S ALSO INTERESTING.I LOVE THE SONG TITLED: KING KILL 33. THE MUSIC'S HYPNOTIC. THE SONG TITLED: COUNT TO 6 AND DIE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.THE SONG TITLED: IN THE SHADOW OF THE VALLEY OF DEATH IS SO SAD.THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC ON THIS CD,AND SO MANY EMOTIONS.MANSON'S REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL!"
2,"Lame, More Lame, Most Lame.","Holy Wood DOES rock, but truly lacks the value I've come to expect from Marilyn Manson. The entire CD reeks of canned studio takes and retakes; it is very polished with exceptional sound quality, but still disappointing. It totally telegraphs every riff and rhythm from the first 30 seconds onward. Holy Wood gives me the mental image of being the product of some incestuous relationship between my Dad's Alice Cooper 70s stuff and my older sister's U2 collection."
1,What the world needs now isn't insanity,"And also ripping other artists off. I remember the first time I heard The Fight Song. I was thinking ""You must be kidding me. This is the most stupid song i have ever heard. I don't even wanna think about it.""He also rips off himself. If you don't already own Antichrist Superstar that's actually just like this. The exception: This one is worse.I liked it better when TR and manson hated each other. Then he tried the directing for ""Star----ers Inc."" That sucked too. And I heard other tracks in advance. This is garbage. If you already have ACS than you don't need this. This is just the wanna be heavy metal verson.Here are the REAL industrial rock bands: Powerman 5000, Nine Inch Nails, Static-X, Rob Zombie, Godsmack, Orgy, Filter, Gravity Kills, and more."
5,The Third and Final Beast,"Marilyn Manson's Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) is the third and final album of his trilogy that he began in 1996 with Antichrist Superstar. The following album was his sequel, Mechanical Animals. Holy Wood is a story about Christ being a piece of mechandise, evolution, and revolution. It is in essence very powerfull and provacative. As contraversial as himself, the album is an autobigraphical story Marilyn Manson from the begining of his musical career. This is truly his greatest album to date. If you enjoyed the previous albums, you will be enthralled by this deep and strong CD."
5,"A ""must have"" for all Fostoria collectors & dealers!!!","This is absolutely the most beautiful and thorough book on Fostoria I have ever seen. It shines light on some of the mysteries and nuances in Fostoria production. It is a well organized, yet detailed reference which includes a large array of photographs, Fostoria advertising pieces and catalog pages along with an extensive listing of pieces and patterns, production dates and 1999 pricing. This is a great book for the new or seasoned collector and dealers. If you buy or sell Fostoria, you should buy this book!"
4,Practical guide to getting maximum marketing advantage from your events.,"Event marketing is more than throwing a great party. Like any marketing endeavor, its ultimate goal is to generate sales. Author Allison Saget keeps her eye on the prize as she teaches you how to plan and execute your next event. She emphasizes that event marketing must be an integral part of your company's total marketing strategy. She covers every aspect of event marketing, including choosing an event, working with sales, crafting a message, generating leads, measuring results and rising above the competition. The book is filled with practical templates and forms she developed during her 20 years in the business. Saget's attention to detail gets a bit tedious; for example, she meticulously describes the best way to pack a suitcase, but that is easy to forgive because so much of the information is valuable. We encourage you to read this thorough handbook before you rent that tent."
5,!!!!!!!!,"Well, i find this flute book completely wonderful, yet too easy. I suppose that would be because the whole flute concept comes easily to me (after two months of puffing along with no sound at first) But as a whole I would highly reccomend this as a flutist, Lotr fanatic and music lover. if you enjoy this, you MUST buy the sound track aswell. It is wonderfully written, and as a whole, just .. wonderful!"
3,"A Decent Product, But Not As Good As Adobe Photoshop","For the amateur photographer, Picture It! Digital Image Pro 7 will be a very useful tool. You can adjust resolution, crop and rotate, and add effects to photos quickly and easily. However, for those looking for a more powerful tool for professional-level projects you would be better off picking up a copy of Adobe Photoshop.For the money, this isn't a bad deal. Just don't expect miracles. Recommended for the casual/amateur user."
2,not for the dogs,this software is a waste of money if you want to edit the white spots from flash pictures of your pet(s). will not do it with red eye correction or paintbrush. i recommend paint shop pro 7 which will take care of the problem and it appears to have all the capability of picture it. plus it is shareware so you can get a 30 day evaluation period and not get stuck with a product that doesn't fill the bill -- like picture it.
5,BUY THIS BOOK!,"In this conversation style book, Loritts relates the Gospel as well as popular Bible stories in modern, easy-to-understand language. This quick read is as entertaining as it is informative. With a solid biblical foundation, this book is perfect for the seeker who is tired of ""being preached to"". Believers who need a fresh look at Bible stories they've heard 1000 times will also enjoy Loritts' style of writing."
5,Great Book,This book is an excellent chronilogical history on the subject of Rockabilly. I don't think anyone has ever covered so much on the subject as Billy Poore has. Good pictures and many items to learn if you think you knew everything on the subject.
3,doesnt seems to get gigabit speed,"Win7 recognized well, but the card seems to lack of gigabit speed via internet or LAN. For the about $10 is okay, but probably wont buy another one."
4,Works with Linux,"I tried this card on two different Linux machines (Fedora and Mint), and it worked fine with both. Benchmarking shows a consistent 85.8 megabytes per second transfer. Using sysbench over sshfs/fuse shows acceptable performance between the two systems."
1,incompatible with my motherboard,"Tried using this to upgrade my old Asus P4P800-VM (Intel 865g based mobo) to Gigabit ethernet. Long story short... every time I rebooted my machine the BIOS/NVRAM forgot about this card and I would have to open the case and unplug/replug the card into the slot. Talk about a nightmare.Ultimately switched this Encore card out for a TRENDnet TEG-PCITXR and haven't had the problem since (even though both cards I received are based on the same chipset). So, for the extra 3 dollars I'm (obviously) happier with the TEG-PCITXR; at least I can now reboot the machine without having to spend 45 minutes opening and closing the case.Strange problem, I know... but it's the God's honest truth. Not sure if it's just the card they sent me or the model itself, still I'm guessing it's not my motherboard since all my other PCI cards work as does the TEG-PCITXR that I've ultimately settled on."
4,Detailed but thin,This book gives a step by step lavishly illustrated guide to carving a house spirit. The project is rather large and more suited to a foredom type tool than a smaller tool such as a dremel. The pictures are clear and detailed sometimes showing more than one method of attaining the same results. The text itself is rather sparse. I would recommend this for the early intermediate power carver rather than a complete novice.
2,You get what you pay for,"Installation went without any hitches, as usual from creative. First thing I tried was Unreal. VERY nice, high quality image, but incredibly slow, compared to the VooDoo 2 I replaced. Next came GlQuake. Very bad. Particles were disgusting, and the weapon sank into the walls. Quake 2 was better visually, but incredibly slow. Same with half-life and kingpin. I returned the card and got a TNT2 Ultra ;)"
2,Disappointing,"I'm referring to the 1986 edition here, and perhaps later editions have resolved what seems to me a problem - too many of the illustrations (about half) are in black and white, and the descriptions on the pages facing them are not too helpful. A page labelled 'Hairstreaks, Coppers, Blues and Giant Skippers' faces a page of black-and-white illustrations; the only hint as to what color any of these butterflies may actually be is next to the one named Ferris's Copper: ""duller, more grayish than that of Ruddy Copper."" Ruddy Copper itself is indeed illustrated in color - 10 pages earlier. If I'm following some butterfly around, trying to identify it, it will certainly proceed to another yard before I can find a helpful color illustration of a similar butterfly or refer to the fuller descriptions in the front and back of the book. I'm not in this to catch them, just to see if I can figure out what's flying through here."
4,Moving Novel,"This is an enjoyable, moving novel about a small town in Nova Scotia and three brothers who are raised by an incredibly anti-social, cynical mother after their father dies when they are very young.I thought that the author managed to make all the characters interesting and believable, even the ones I didn't like. I really enjoyed this novel, and look forward to Greer's next book."
2,Playing Soldier,"This was my first book on the Miltia. The book appears to have been based on transcripts of arrest, trial, and legal records. I believe the interviews of the townspeople and all others that were envolved would have offered a much better story. I ascertained a little boy playing at war along with being a biker,a loner and anything else he could conjure up in his fractured mind of heroism. I did gain one thought, if these folks believe what they claim lets make them our secret weapon in our current debacle. They can be our suicide bombers. That will level the playing field."
5,great invention,"The best set we own: lots of idea that can be realized and tweaked, can be used simly as a carriage for toys or as imaginary ice-cream. On the other side of the spectrum are complicated figures, flowers and anything you can imagine. Teaches kids to imagine, to be patient and carefult when connecting pieces. On top of it all, it's pretty sturdy! Love it!"
5,Awesome!!,I have had these since I was a child and love them so much I got them for my child all these years later. Mostly because I only have like ten pieces left and wanted a complete collection of them to play with! Highly recommend this to anyone with children!
1,memorex cdr 74 min,I TRYIED THE MEMOREX CDR DISC AND HAD NOTHING BUT STATIC ON EVERY CD I TRIED TO CREATE.TDK HAS WORKED THE BEST FOR ME.
1,Only Brand That's Given Me Problems,"I've used several brands of recordable CD's, including Maxell, but the Memorex Platinum blank CD's are the only ones that have given me problems."
1,Total Waste of Time!,"I've been an Underdog fan for years. I've always loved the dry sense of humor and great voices. Unfortunately, this book does not convey any of this. It spends more time on what the creators ate and drank while creating the series than any great insights on the creative process.I was also extremely disappointed in the art work in the book. For a book on Underdog, there's no pictures of Underdog except for the cover. There are incredibly boring pictures of offices, restaurants and famous people like Marilyn Monroe who don't need explanation.Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,Underated and Unknown,"A movie rarely talked about and grossly overlooked. Zelig is a wonderful film, filmed in the style of the boreing historical documentories we were forced to watch in grade school or on pbs. This film is anything but boreing, switching from black and white to recent color interviews. Zelig is a story of a very plain man named Leonard Zelig. To fit in, he changes his personality to suit his surroudings in the 1920's. With a black person, he becomes black. The same goes with different nationalities, political views, religon, etc.... Gordon Willis' cinematography is ahead of it's time, seeing Woody Allen with Babe Ruth, Woodrow Wilson, etc.... Hello Forest Gump! I hope Zelig will be given the dvd treatment. It's a crime it's not even available on vhs. It's only 79 minutes but at 79 minutes an original classic from the master, Woody Allen."
4,The unsaid joke(s),"What I love most about this movie are the jokes (sight gags, situations, etc) that are alluded to but remain unsaid or unseen. The way that they are simply spoken about by the announcer of this ""documentary"" in a straight manner invokes a scene that could have been shot and included, but is so much funnier in your mind. (My review lacks eloquence, but I think the effect of Allen's interesting presentation of the comedy must be seen. It had me laughing out loud.)"
4,No More Pancakes...,"I really liked this movie. My favorite part is when Zelig (Woody Allen), in a hypnotic state just insults Mia Farrow (and her cooking...those pancakes really must have traumatized poor Zelig). A lot of the historical aspects were just lost on me, because I have no memory for history. But Woody was hilarious. He's great at improvising and you can always tell when he's just ad-libbing some jokes. I liked the documentary style and all of the interviewees were really believable and really funny. And how crazily funny was that Chameleon dance? My only complaint is I would have LOVED to see more of Eudora's mother; I died laughing every time she set that reporter straight. Everyone in this movie was really great and this was Woody & Mia at their best together. Now, I feel compeled to finally read (and actually finish) Moby Dick."
4,murky beauty,"For those (like me) not very familiar with the music loosely categorized as ""noise"", this is a great place to start. Though from the most well-known New Zealand noise band, the album still has some loose pop song structures that make it more acessible than most noise albums. If you like what you hear, you might be interested in music from Corpus Hermeticum, a record label run by Bruce Russels, one of the members of this group. He's very friendly and offers music from New Zealand at very reasonable prices!"
2,Title and contents are two different things,I purchased this book with high expectation but it failed completely and I willnot advice to purchase this book just by looking at the title.
3,OK...but not worth the money,"This case seems too small for the Archos. The Archos does come with a case, but it doesn't provide a way to stand the player up if you want to, so this case is ok; and it does have a belt clip as well."
1,This book is horrible!!,The publisher should be embarrassed putting out a book like this. It is full of mistakes. In some cases all four of the four answers are incorrect for the problems. Most of the tests only give you the correct answers for the problems not how they were solved. If would be helpful if they explained all of the questions.
5,An essential tool for anyone preparing for the Dante Exam,Jack Rudman has really outdone himself in perfecting the ultimate preparation guide for the Dante Business exam. Jack's clear and concise explanation of the subject has led me and the rest of my class at St. Joseph's College to master the exam. Even my cousin with a learning deficiency has almost passed the exam and within seven to eight more tries I'm sure she will.
4,Another Lynchburger,"Charming book. I was born and grew up in Lynchburg and was delighted to have memories of ""those days"" renewed. Even though the book would be of special delight to people who know Lynchburg, there is a universality to the experiences Dr. Hook reports that should be of interest to almost everybody who has an imagination and is over 12 years of age."
2,Hum...,"This book was an optional text for a basic web development course. I doubt any of the other students in the course bothered to read it. It is not appropriate for that level course. It focuses on useability and customer requirements gathering etc. For me, in that area, I've read better. I got rid of the book."
1,Skip this,"I marvel at the folks who read this and gave it five stars. Presumably, all were friends of the writer (""a customer"" wrote most of the reviews). Having tried several times to get into the book, I finally gave up. The writing is horribly pedantic, relying on lame descriptions of thoughts and events rather than having action paint the characters or story. I must add that the reviews on the back cover are not written by any literary critics of note, and that the publisher is unknown, and, I suspect, a self-published house. Skip this one and save your $$."
5,Fun and Educational for the entire family!,"When I saw this game I had to get it. It's like a mix of ""Life"" and ""Monopoly"" with a political twist. Never was anything having to do with politics this much fun. My teenage girls LOVE this game. My friends love this game. Even my mother-in-law loves this game. Who could ask for more than that? This is an extremely quality game, too. Durable and beautifully made. Politics is a hit and will be a family favorite for many years to come. Thanks Chum Chum for an awesome game! Keep 'em coming!!"
3,"Great fun, but not the top choice in election type board games","my nine year old loves this game...when he wins an office we have him go to the family bible and repeat the appropriate oath to be sworn in for that title... while it does allow the player to appreciate that both money and fame, along with some good old luck combine for a successful bid for office the extent of educational value is diminished with glib trivia, rather than more sound information. If you can only buy one board game to enhance a learning experience on politics I would strongly recommend Race for the White House.. That board game really allows a detailed look at how electoral votes are distributed amongst the farm, union, liberal, conservative, and minority groups. As a home school mom i would definitely say go with the latter if you are trying to make up your mind about a game."
1,Couldn't stop laughing,"We played Politics on Thanksgiving with the whole family.My father decided he had made enough money to go straight into the Presidency. Oh, but he got a card that took all his power way and he had to go to the beginning. He decided to quit. So I picked up in his spot. How funny. We laughed so hard cause he gave up so quick, only to find out that he could've kept his 150,000.00 which instantly gave me the advantage.This game is so much fun. And extremely educational.I love it."
5,Best Toilet Tissue Ever,This Toilet Tissue is absolutely the best for sensitive skin and allergies. I won't (willingly) use any other.
3,"Not bad, but the lighting system needs help","My old eyes are in need of a bit of help at close range for hobby work. I bought one of these about two years ago (for a LOT less money, BTW) and the magnifying lenses do a pretty good job. The class act in these devices use glass lenses, these are plastic, scratch easily, and are of fair optical quality.My biggest gripe is the lighting system; two old-tech incandescent bulbs which are poorly focused on the work. The light's focus does not coincide with any combination of the lenses. Even worse, the lights are not ""aimable."" They resolutely point straight ahead, illuminating on either side of where I'm looking, not on the object itself.If you are serious about close work, spend the extra money and get something with glass lenses (Optivisor comes to mind) and buy a clip on LED light or one of the dedicated light kits.Dave"
3,Very useful gear but the 'short sighted',"I can't find a gear that help me work with my fine hobbies like this one. But I expected to be able to see from a longer distance! I can be no more than 20 CM away from the object to see it clearly.I was surprised to discover another pair of plastic lenses in the 'roof' of the head piece!! they magnify more, but I have to come to about 10 cm from the object.It's still great because I can use my glasses. For me it's not as a big issue as it is for some one who has asitgmatism!The head belt fairly stays secured on the head, but I'm afraid that the joints seem questionable, and may yield by time, to have the glasses falling all the time.the lights don't shoot exactly in the center, but rather to the sides of the central field. When examining an object at a close distance or bigger magnification they shoot behind it.Although the build is cheap, but its still more than adequate and a real bargain."
3,Newman,"I absolutely have to admit that the book is very simple to read and understand but for my course sake, my professor has to use an additional book to give me the depth the course requires."
5,Very Good Battery,"This battery is simply very good, shipped within 1-2 days, charges fast, lasts longer than those crappy batteries that you get with your rc car. I will and have bought again."
5,COBY CX-C21,The product was affordable and I was able to give it to several of my friends so they could share some of my cassettes. Most retail stores no longer carry this product so it was very convenient to order it. I was pleased to receive the products timely.
2,Poor Quality but not bad for the price.,"Not bad for the price, but I found the sound quality very poor. Perhaps good for a child to play with but not much more than that."
2,"COBY CX-21, an adequate cassette player","The Coby CX-21 is an inexpensive but adequate stereo cassette player for home or outdoor use. The sound quality is good but the unit is unshielded and picks up noise - static, that can be quite loud, from any radio source. I was unabale to use the player on an airplane or near my microwave when it is running. The player has no reverse to review what you just played and the fast forward control is slow. To play the second side of the tape you have to take the cassette out and flip it. If not for the static, which limits where the player can be used, I would rate this much higher given its very low price."
3,Replacement Worked OK,The original item received played everything at an accelerated speed. The replacement unit plays just fine. For $5 it's a good value.
4,Lightweight player,I just received and it seems to be working great. I did discover that it should not be worn/used around a working microwave - really strange noises came from it.
2,"Not needed, stick with Black Knight expansion","Not impressed with this pack at all. Sure it's cheap, but Black Knight has all you need for Mechs and new weapons. Very little offered here."
1,Beware of Spyware,"While I enjoyed the added mechs, this software and its counterpart innersphere contain the C-Dilla spyware. The Black Knight expansion pack also contains it. This is a copywrite protection program that installs on your machine and does not shut down after you exit the game. TurboTax also installs the program and the only way to remove it is to download and run the safecast uninstaller program from the intuit website. Including this program was a terrible thing for Microsoft to do, especially since it does not disclose the fact at any time."
1,Connectivity lost,"The patch included in the pack renders the game unable to connect through a router. All multiplayer ability was lost, even behind the router. The same goes for the Inner Sphere pack."
1,Patch in a box,This game is exactly what the title is. And with Mercs out it is as useless as ever. The only reason to buy this and the inner sphere version is for the Mechs. If your a hardcore gamer go ahead and get it. If your undecided its not worth the trouble.
2,Not even worth the price!,"I bought these speakers, foolishly expecting them to be at least a little better than my tinny laptop speakers. Unfortunately, that was not the case; they were so quiet that even with my computer's sound turned up all the way I at first could not tell if they were even working. I suppose if you just need speakers for some incredibly basic reason then these do function, but if you want them for any kind of enjoyment, seek elsewhere. I literally threw them into the recycling--must be environmentally friendly, you know--within a half hour of opening the box."
1,Waste of time,This is a complete waste of time. I regret buying this item. You can barely hear anything when u even bring it close to your ear. Dont waste your money!
1,Supremely bad,"Shouldn't even be called ""speakers."" I attached these to my netbook whose speakers are not great but are better than these little things. These made the sound muffled and I am better off using the netbook speakers instead. Do not bother."
1,Avoid--there are better options for only a few dollars more.,"Very inferior sound. Instead of these, spend [...] and buy the Philips SBP1100/37 portable speakers [...]The Philips have much better sound, and only cost a few dollars more."
3,"Good start, but...","This series of Woody Mann's, where he includes transcriptions and 3 CDs in order to examine the technique of specific artists, are good works for beginners and intermediate players who require slower tuition (i.e. songs slowed down, rehearsal of technique, a measure of technical information).The major problem is that Mann's instructions on the CDs are sometimes confusing. He makes mistakes and corrects himself, but one can't help but wonder why these mistakes weren't edited out before release? He sometimes takes a second to right himself, and it can be annoying and confusing.A lesser problem is that the releases are quite 'bare bones'. There's no printed matter besides the (partial) transcriptions - no photographs explaining techniques beyond Mann's narration. This could be a real problem for a beginner.So, this release is a mixed bag. It will help you play Big Bill's exceptional music, but it can be frustrating at times."
5,Amazing!,"The Cult of Mac is a delightful read whether you're a Mac User or not. It covers everything you need to know about Mac's with great depth, so much so, that you won't ever want to put the book down. If you want to be reading on a Sunday afternoon or during the evening at home, this book is perfect. PC users beware....who knows the next time you might reading this review, it may just be from your new Mac.A very informative and entertaining read, The Cult Of Mac is not to be missed. Get those Christmas lists ready now!"
4,Marechek is amazing!,"We bought this mostly to get Tom Marechek to autograph it at a recent Washington Bayhawks game. While he's fun to watch on the DVD, he's better to watch when he's playing. Young players would probably get more out of attending one of his summer camps."
3,just ok ; not recommendable...,"Does not keep liquid really hot for as many hours as promised. My experience is 10-12 hours maximum. may be 7-8 hours in cold weather...On the other hand, the label ""Made in China"" took the element of surprise out..One can also touch the top and feel the heat escaping out. A good insulator should not feel tangibly hot to the touch."
1,Poor quality product,"I just received the thermos and the first time I used it I filled it about two-thirds full with hot coffee...AFTER I LET HOT WATER SIT IN THE THERMOS FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. After about 5 hours, the coffee was luke warm.The second time, I put hot coffee in the thermos filling it up to about one-third full....AFTER I LET HOT WATER SIT IN IT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. Again, after about 5 hours, it was luke warm again.Amazon was really good about taking it back....giving me an INSTANT (before they even received the returned item!) gift card credit and also providing a return label and paying the postage.Poor quality product but excellent quality service from Amazon."
4,"great product, with a few problems","in terms of durability, size, and usefulness, this thing rocks. I abuse my stuff on the trail and this has put up with quite a bit mord than my other thermos. It stores about two meals worth of soup at the least, even if your idea of a meal is a lot. The two cups on top let me share it with a friend easily, and it store heat for most of the day.where it falls short is the price and the bulkyness. its pretty expensive and really big. Despite this it's still pretty light for its size. Also, the lack of a handle is great for storage but not for pouring; gloved hands are slippery on its surface.This thing is perfect if your a dad with a big family to feed on a trip, or if your on a 3-4 day trip. if your just a day hiker, look for smaller, more manageable thermos.4/5 because it does what its supposed to magnificently but has a few problems."
1,Less than 3 months the vacuum is not working,Vacuum has stopped working and no longer keeps items hot! Would not buy this item again - had to replace with another vacuum bottle and since it is after 30 days cannot return to Amazon - but after 90 days this should not have failed
2,Hard to handle,"I mainly bought this because it was priced lower than the other thermoses and looked like it wouldn't be too thermosy looking on the counter at home. My wife prefered the old thermos because it had some black ribs thus matching the black coffee pot. So I got stuck with this. It does a good job keeping my coffee hot, but my beef is the difficulty in handling. The surface is matte and slick (good for guitar necks but terrible for this). There is no handle, which of course a knew, but would really appreciate now that I've used this a few days. The circumference is too big for medium to small hands to grip, so to pour is a two handed job. It at least needs a grip like some large plastic juice bottles come with now. I think Stanley was shooting for a retro design, but I don't need a display piece. I'll probably be taking this back to the store to exchange for something more useful."
1,"Poor Workmanship, Great Design","Beautiful design, good old-time American company. Now manufactured in China with NO QUALITY CONTROL TESTING. Failed to hold vacuum after two months. Stanley sent me a new replacement for free, which also failed after two months. NNNNNGK! I am switching to Nissan."
5,Well built bottle,A great companion to the Stanley 16 oz. drink mug. Well built and keeps drinks hot/cold for hours.
3,poor packing,"The book came as it was stated, used,. But the package was terrible. The paper was just a grocery bag,and the tape was just every day tape, and it was only hanging on by one piece, The mailman brought it to me to my house because it was in such bad shape. Some one should tell her how to wrap and ship things."
5,Literary genius,"Passes To Kill a Mockingbird as the greatest piece of literature I have ever read. I was up at two a.m. some nights saying, ""just one more page."" Soon, just one more page turns into several more pages!"
2,Library,checked this book out in attempt to find why my fuel system wasn't working. If you have a 1987 ford f 350 like me look for a different book. This book is no help to me and is geared more towards the later 7th generation fords.
2,Very Limited,"I was very disappointed by the level of detail presented in this book. The Chilton Total Car Care CD-ROM has 10 times the information.There are simply too many engines and body variations for this book to adequately cover with this few pages.If you don't want to spend the real money and get the Helms Manual, but the Chilton."
2,Not helpful,"There is no sequence to the picture numbering. ""Locate the fuel filter on the inside of the left-side rail (see illustration)"" the problem is that there are 6 illustrations on the page and none is labelled left-side frame rail.Certain factory parts of my truck are NOT in this book. It names some parts but leaves you wondering the purpose or need of said part."
4,Haynes Ford Bronco repair manual,"The manual arrive in great condition; a little yeallowed on the edges but not torn or greasy. I doubt I could keep a manual in such good condition. It arrived in a few days, and the seller kept me informed of it's shipping status and checked to make sure it arrived."
2,Not Available in Widescreen Format,"Too bad. Pretty scenery, resolution is not great, but the music is decent harp/acoustic guitar."
1,A CELEBRATION OF SOUTHERN SLAVERY,"THIS VIDEO, WITHOUT A DOUBT, HAS A CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL VALUE. IT OFFERS US A NARROW (VERY NARROW) VIEW INTO A SELDOM SEEN AND LITTLE KNOWN ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE. THE CHARACTERS ARE COLORFUL AND THERE IS A CERTAIN CRUDE ELOQUENCE IN SOME OF THE DIALOGUE. HAVING SAID THAT, HOWEVER, IT MUST BE STATED THAT THERE IS A DEPRESSING ELEMENT TO THE THING, OVERALL. THE STORY IS ONLY TOLD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PIMPS, WHO COME ACROSS AS VAIN, STRUTTING, EMOTIONALLY DERANGED VULTURES, NO DOUBT THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF SOME FORM OF EARLY CHILDHOOD ABUSE. THEIR FEEBLE ATTEMPTS AT CONCOCTING SOME FORM OF COHERENT CODE THAT JUSTIFIES THEIR TRADE AND METHODS ARE LUDICROUS AND TRANSPARENTLY SELF-SERVING. THE WHOLE THING, ON BALANCE, IS JUST ONE BIG MINSTREL SHOW. NO DOUBT 150 YEARS AGO IN THE SAME SOUTH, THEIR GREAT,GREAT,GREAT GRANDMOTHERS OVERHEARD SIMILAIR PROPAGANDA DISPENSED AROUND THE DINNER TABLES THEY WERE SERVING"
3,Not the best guide,"This guide has a lot of great information in it but it's not worth it unless you're going to be away from a computer for a few days. Instead of buying this guide I recomend going to GameFAQs and looking up some of the guides for this game. Not only do the GameFAQ guides tell you about Crossbone Island they include all of the classes, djinn, etc. And in many cases the FAQs have much better detailed descriptions. My advice, buy a pack of printer paper and print out an FAQ from gamefaqs.com. You'll still get the help you need and save some money."
4,A Helpful maunal,"The pictures and diagrams are very useful. Sometimes the text can be a little confusing because parts of an explanation are spread out over several areas of the text, and it's a struggle to put the whole explanation all together. Overall, a very useful manual."
3,"Good, but could be better","Don't expect too much of it. There are a lot of errors in the text and screenshots, too. Also the maps aren't really professional, as you can see Felix (or Isaac) on one map about 25X instead of 1X or 0X. Crossbone Island isn't reviewed and some special effects or logics aren't included, such as rare drops. Also, not all information (such as how many HP Dullahan - ap. 16500HP - or the Final Boss has) is filled in.However, the psynergy- and itemguides are fine (though, I would like it, if there was a list of dropped items, weapons and armor). I think this book is nice if you like collecting Golden Sun items."
3,Okay...,"This guide will help you for both of the games, and is a great deal. Unfortunely, some parts of the game it does not go into enough detail to help. All in all, an average guide."
4,Good Guide,"It's a really nice guide, with handy list of classes, psynergy spells and items. The walkthrough is clear with great in-screen games.Unfortunately is not complete. At least for Golden Sun, there does not come the Crossbone Island sub-quest which has some complex puzzles, gives you a Djinn YOU REALLY NEED in Golden Sun 2 and many useful items (altough most of them cursed). It only comes as a note, and IMHO this diminishes the value of this guide.I don't know if something similar is missing for the Golden Sun 2 section."
4,"Does what its suppose to do, a good little card.",For my older emachine with a bum video card the Radeon 9200 did the trick. Its nothing to write home about but for the price its a great card.
2,unusual fit,These gloves aren't tapered at all for the normal human arm. They are too tight in the upper arm and way too large in the wrist area.
1,False advertising,The gloves depicted reach up over the elbow; the real ones did not ( and on a short person). The gloves depicted read shiny; the gloves received were matt. The gloves received were the only wrong note in the costume; they looked like dish washing gloves. Sorry.
5,WOW,"All i can say about this book is WOW. It's absolutely amazing how the author collected so many poems and put them in a book and made them so incredibly wonderful to read through. This is for anyone who cares anything about poety. Get this book and even if you dislik poetry, I'm sure you'll love it after reading this book."
1,This is a poorly written book!,"The rating of 1-star for this book is rather a compliment for this poorly written book by Heidi Vernon. The book is outlined in a confusing manner with chapter content unrelated to it's chapter titles. Terminologies and definitions are not clearly defined. In fact, there ARE no definitions in this book. Since this textbook is written mostly in an essay form, students to this subject are expected to already know any terms or jargon in this subject. There are grammatical errors and typos in this book. THIS IS THE SIXTH EDITION? How did it ever get this far?"
4,I like it,I just wanna say thank you to Erwin for sending me my order on time. I really like the USB even if it is not like the picture.
3,Gaming and Watching DVDs only**,"I have had this monitor for 2 days and have tried every setting combination possible. The colors are bright and vibrant and when watching night or dark scenes on dvd the picture is amazing. I am not a gamer, so can't say how it looks for that. However, you cannot get a clear text no matter what your setting. I spoke to tech support at View Sonic and they verified that this monitor is truly designed for graphics and not text. Text is most blurry in center of screen and some words have such ""shadowing"" that you can hardly read them. Sorry View Sonic, but back to the store you go. Should have had that information in your technical description or on the box."
4,every day chinese,"we love using this cook book, the food is delicious, the only problem is living in a small town, it's hard to find some of the ingredients.. so we have to plan way ahead. It's fairly easy and worth it. If you love Chinese food, and you enjoy cooking, give this book a try"
1,No pictures - Don't buy this book,I have never in my life seen a cooking book without pictures. The recepies may be great but how can you choose without pictures of the food? this is a fundemental flaw in a cookbook.
4,"Gritty, real.","This is my first Denise Mina novel, so i came into this with no expectations or preconceptions. This is writing and character development that is in the very first rank of crime novels. Ms. Mina economy of language is outstanding. You rarely find authors today who know how to use words so efficiently.There is a great story here, filled with some memorable characters and situations. I was done reading this so fast, i had to read it again because the pleasure was to good to walk away from.I'll be delving into this young woman's remaining portfolio immediately, starting with ""Garnethill"""
3,Middling at best,"Sketchy writing (especially early on) and sketchy plotting. I found the linking of the dual narrative a bit of a stretch and that they really didn't work together at the end of it all. It was like Mina was so taken with the true Paddy Meehan story that she worked her novel around it until she felt it fit. But it just felt jarring and stilted to me. Most annoying though, was the constant harping on about weight, fat and eating. I wouldn't have expected this from a female writer and found it almost insulting to read. At the same time there is something compelling about the bumbling young sleuth so I will give book 2 a go and see if it is any better."
3,Paddy (Patricia) Meehan Is Unique Character,"I enjoyed Field of Blood, especially the main character. What I didn't appreciate was the secondary plot. Apparently the author actually met a real man named Paddy Meehan (1960s) who was convicted of a crime and later pardoned. But trying to connect him to the plot about her female protagonist Paddy (Patricia) Meehan (early 1980s) was not at all successful. In fact, it was like a big non sequitur stuck in at points throughout the book. The fact that they shared a name was contrived and made the plot difficult to follow. The main story and plot that took place in the '80s was well done and deserved 4 stars. The characters were multi-dimensional, and it was fun to read a novel that takes place in Scotland. Mina writes really well, and it was an easy read; the plot was interesting and moved quickly. If Mina removed the sections about the real Paddy Meehan--which had nothing to do with the main story--this book would be a crackerjack."
4,Stunning-a real thriller!,"Absolutely stunning, riveting throughout. I just could not put it down. Ms. Mina is a first class writer of crime drama. The only drawback is it's having been written for a British audience. The characters are incredibly real, the crime horrific, but not garishly told. The story flows from the first page, and has a well thought out excellent ending."
5,son loves it,"The only negative thing I can say is they did not make any more. My kids love it, even my little girl asks to watch it."
4,An excellent addition to any spiritual library,"I believe that Jim Marion is essential reading for serious students of Christianity, spiritual life and growth. The book is well written and challenges the reader to go inside to find the true meaning of Christ words, life and actions. In the end one comes away with the clear challenge to inquire, develop and strengthen the inner man . . . As Christ said ""the kingdom of God is within you"" . . ."
5,Suprised How Much It Changed My Thinking,"I was a pastor when I first read this book. It challenged some of my own beliefs such as believing my own ideas about Christ were the only ones and therefore correct. Marion shares his own various spiritual paths and offers others to consider them as well even though some outside your comfort level. Particularly interesting was his discussion about evil spirits being drawn to negative energy and attaching themselves to us due to our own loss of joy. For me his book seemed to come from an anguished heart that wrestles honestly with the pursuit of God. Unflinching in his own struggles, in the end his trust is ""Christ is all."""
2,Not Christian but more Gnostic-like ideas with Buddhism thrown in,"Psyche-based faith espoused here vs true faith w/conversion. ideas are NON-CHRISTIAN and lean heavily towards Gnoticism and Buddhism vs following Christ as the Lord and Savior. Author even recommends teenagers be allowed to discover spiritual ""growth"" through pre-marital sex! Good for research only and NOT life application!"
2,Author believes in re-incarnation,page 289 tells us we will be re-incarnated. I never read that in the Bible.
4,Very Good,"I am a fan of Loreena McKennitt and really loved the Book of Secrets. This is a good CD, but not as good Book of Secrets."
4,The Mystic's Dream,"I have all of Ms Mckennitt's work and it is hard to pick a favorite though some stand out, CE He Mise Le Ulaingt? or the two trees is a magical and beautiful feast for the soul and the beautiful singing of McKennitt weaves it's lovely way through this piece. Santiago is Inspired by the celtic influence she found in the Galacian area of spain, Marrakesh night market is another spirited piece of middle eastern influence, and The Bonny swans is another of Mckennitt's best work a traditional irish lyric based on a fable in which a girl is drowned by her eldest sister. Prospero's speach is from the end titles of Shakespear's Tempest which starred Helen Miren. Though I would not make this one of my first picks frequently you find some songs on other albums."
3,Casio leather pouch,I purchased this for a Casio Exillim EX-H20G camera and it was too small for the camera. It is a beautiful case so we kept it and used it for extra battery and SD cards.
4,Good music for fans of Grandaddy or M. Ward,"This album has a hard-to-describe ethereal quality about it, at once both whimsical and earnest. Its not fast, not slow, and not really in between, just a nicely paced, full length cd. I must admit that I enjoy M. Ward'd vocals much more than the other frontman, yet he is no slouch. If you like Grandaddy (Jason Lytle plays keys on this) or M. Ward, this album will stay in your player for a while."
2,"Abominable Earpiece, trouble with the charger","Save your money, the earpiece I got is flimsy and seems make the music skip. Connecting the earpiece also destabilizes the Palm OS. I have had to do numerous soft resets.Receiving calls & listening to music via the earpiece is a painful experience"
5,great book,"I read this book when I was 13, it had me completely hooked by the time I was finished with the 1st chapter! The way the author draws you in getting inside the life of the white puma is amazing! I wish I could get a current copy but it is out of print and I haven't been able to find it. If you have a copy hold on to it"
5,Science and Logic,Great book. Gives readers a head start in an era when people are looking for direction. Especially for those of us who look to science for all the answers.
4,Very good book about Shirley Temple.,"This is the third book I have read about the life of Shirley Temple. It is worth reading. I think the book by Anne Edwards is slightly better, however this book has an interview with her first husband that I don't believe the Anne Edwards book has. John Agar is quoted. The book didn't go into as much detail about her movie career as the Anne Edwards book but it had some details that ""American Princess"" did not.I would recommend this book to any Shirley Temple lover as a good read."
3,"Gee, this looks interesting, too!","This strange cd looks interesting, too! I don't know anything about it, either, but this one looks strange and interesting, too, and I hope I can buy it someday soon, too! As soon as I get this and the other cd, I will come back and make sure reviews for both. Until then, ""Ta, ta!"""
3,too good too be true,"I bought this locking pin about 2 years ago and it worked fine for about a year. I was changing hitches about every two weeks then. Changing from trailer hitch to bike rack hitch to boat hitch for the weekends. However, afer I sold the boat I did not change it as often and it got dirt in the key slot. When I went to change to a biking hitch I could not get it unlocked so I went to a locksmith and he tired to get it off but failed. The only solution was to cut it off. So the lock works great if you never have to change it, This was for a class 3 hitch."
3,Tony,"This guy seems to have implied that he authored the Shel Silverstein poem ""Listen to the Musn'ts"" in one of his lectures to a youth event. That's the way it seemed to me.Nontheless he stands out as a moderate in a sea of right-wing fundamentalists. I credit him with that much.""We've met the enemy and they are partly right"" was a great book."
1,Low Quality,"Do yourself a favor and buy a Yamaha recorder or similar. This recorder is badly designed. The hole for low C is difficult to reach because the bulky lower joint gets in the way. The recorder sounds okay in the first octave (Though F is weak), but the second octave... I can barely get it past high G, and it is very shrill. It also is not particularly attractive. It's actually a rather ugly simplification: I like the ordinary baroque design better. In any case, if you are buying for a child, I have had good results with the YRS24B (a school level Soprano Recorder). For an adult, I would recomend starting with the 300 series: resonably priced and very high quality. Also consider an alto recorder rather than a soprano -- it's somewhat bigger for adult hands, and has a pretty sound. I really haven't had experience with the other brands, but a quick google search should help you there. Make sure to stick with companies that have experience in instrument making -- not toy making."
1,Flimsy!!!,I bought this product for my nephew in the car. The item brok within twenty minutes of use. Nothing I did can fix it. Very flimsy and not worth the money paid for it.
1,Do not buy!!,I purschaed this item once and it didn't work but I gave it another chance. I ordered it again and the product would not charge my DVD player!! Please do not waste your time and money!!
1,junk,I bought two of these and wish I had read the reviews first ( I normally do) Both blew the fuse within 1 minute of being plugged in to my portable dvd player (needing 9 volts) it was set at 9 volts...one of them made the dvd player smoke within 30 seconds before blowing the fuse...dont waste your money.
2,Won't last - Won't last - Won't last - crappy plastic and overheats,"I used it for a couple months for my daughters dvd player in the car. from day one it got really hot, and i replaced the fuse several times, now the plastic broke so you cant even plug it in. The heat really made me nervous, i will not ever buy or use this charger again."
3,Worked with some difficulty,"The connector to you appliance worked for some but not the others. I have two portable DVD player, worked for one but not the other. Buyer be aware."
1,Defective,Actually zero stars. It Wouldn't work so I went out and bought one that did for more money. Didn't want to spend $18 but I needed it to work.
1,Does not work as advertized.,I bought this as a replacement for my COBY DVD player as i lost the original car adaptor. And this is listed specifically as supporting my model. But within 5 mins of me putting this in for charging the fuse on it went out. This product doesnt work with COBY's own portable DVD player. i am seriously disappointed.
1,WTF COBY,"I bought this specifically for my Coby portable DVD player. The battery is shot and I only use it in the car, the thing doesn't work at all. Doesn't charge, doesn't power. WTF?!"
2,1ST ONE DID NOT WORK,"Had to return the 1st one which did not work. Good thing it was easy to return at no cost to me. Amazon quickly replaced it. Just tried to see if it's working. It is,but haven't really used it yet."
1,Never worked,"I purchased this charger for Coby V-zon portable DVD player. We were not able to use it even once, the charging light comes on but the unit never charges."
1,This product is really great,This product performs exactly as expected. If the expectation that within 10 seconds of plugging it in to your car or boat's 12v outlet it is to melt and burst into flames forcing you to put said fire out with the nearest cup of coffee.The good news is that the plastic is so cheap you can scrape it off of your dashboard with your thumbnail.If you need an insurance claim I heartly recommend this item.If you need something to power one of your devices without spontaneously com0busting then I hardly recommend this item.
5,All that you will ever need / Todo lo que puedas necesitar,Perfect to replace almost any damaged car-charger. It comes with multiple plugs and it's very easy to change one for another.---Perfecto para reemplazar casi cualquier cargador para carro dañado. Viene con varios conectores y son muy faciles de cambiar.
1,Highly Disappointed,"We bought this to use with the Coby portable DVD player for a long car trip - Did not work at all. The first time we plugged it in the DVD player would not turn on. We tested the DVD player by plugging it into the wall and it worked fine.We tried the car adapter again and it worked, but for 10 minutes before the DVD player shut off itself. The car adapter also got really hot really quick.We let the car adapter cool off and then tried the DVD player again; it worked for about 5 minutes. I would NOT recommend this product - We bought it because there were so many other positive reviews."
1,doesn't work,I had to buy a car adapter because the dvd player didn't come with one. It does not stay in the player so the player turns off as soon as you get it started.I DO NOT recommend this product.
1,Poor quality,"This heats up super quick in the car. The most we were able to use was 15 minutes of the portable DVD. And after a few months, it just died. Waste of money..."
1,did not work!!,we just opened the package today and it DID NOT work with our coby dvd player when we tried it...we know our car adapter is working because we tried another one(gps) and it worked...the dvd is also working because we tried it in the house...so do i get a refund or a replacement?
3,Nothing from nothing leaves nothing,I've been looking for one of these gadgets for a long time and can't wait to read more reviews so that I dont get one that dies in my arms...but honestly. $4.+ dollars? What can anyone expect for something that is suppost to do high tech stuff?You have to pay to play.
1,Cannot believe this piece of junk product is still being sold,"I purchase it on Feb 16, 2011 from J&R Electronics Inc. (no problem with the seller). This Coby IC Regulated 800mA Universal DC Car Converter CA709 is just piece of junk and I cannot believe it is still being sold. As soon as one pulls it to unplugs it, the threads are so bad that the whole thing dismantles and the spring, fuse, etc. parts just fall all around in the car. This dismantling was happening EVERY time of unplugging it. Do not buy it and waste money."
2,Worked 1 year (very light use),I do not recommend. Used about 1x per month for portable DVD player in car. Stopped working after about 12-15 uses.
1,Coby CA709 overrated mA,"This Coby CA709 is overrated advertising. I used it for a wireless camera (rated 0.6A), and the power LED of this camera is flickering and the camera not working at all. Until, I went to a local electronic store, and purchased another DC Car converter rated 1800 mA, and my wireless camera works fine with its power LED stays ON constantly. 30 days return policy passed, and I will throw it away."
1,Adaptor do not Fit,"Total waste of money. I bought it to use with a Coby portable DVD player. A Coby car adaptor for a Coby player should work, shouldn't it. I discovered that the spacing of the pins on the little plugs that are provided in the package did match the hole spacing on the car charger side. In other words, you can't plug them in. Unfortunately I did not try to use it until after the Amazon return grace period. After reading some of the reviews, I have concluded that they do this as a safety measure. I mean if you can't use it, it can't overheat. What a piece of cr*p."
1,It got hot and melted.,"We noticed right away that the switch got very hot when we used it for the first time a few weeks ago. My husband just took it out and noticed that the switch part actually melted. To those commenting that it drains the battery, when you connect it to the adapter, there is a positive and negative, like a battery, so if you attach it wrong, it will drain instead of charge the battery."
2,Not enough ooommph,"The unit works, but doesn't have enough mA to power my DroidX phone. With today's bigger batteries a small charger such as this one isn't very useful."
1,Defective car charger,The charger lasted only 10 min. It got hot and went dead after that.DO NOT buy this product. Its a wasted time and money for shipping and handling.
1,DOA,"Got this for my 7"" Coby DVD player. First time trying to use it no lights came on ar anything. Took apart and it had a blown fuse!!"
3,Worked great,Bought this after we lost the charger for our portable dvd player. We used it on a long trip across country and it worked great.
3,It is ok.,My husband wanted a charger in his semi to charge the tablet. The charger gets hot when it is charging. He isn't using it at this time. It did a GREAT job of charging but he was afraid it would cause harm to his truck.
5,A summary of the book princess test,"The Princess Test is a vary easy book to read and vary intertaning for boys and girls. Make sure you read the ""epilogue!"" Because the ending of the story is in those two little pages."
4,Another Levine twist on a classic fairy tale.,"&#65279;The Princess Test, by Gail Carson Levine, was a well thought-out and carefully expounded version of Hans Christian Anderson's The Princess and the Pea. It made a good read, but was rather short, giving slight room for those important `little' details such as character development. Levine told her tale in true Anderson style, much like the original story, but with Levine's humor and clever twists to the plot. Those who have enjoyed Levine's previous book Ella Enchanted will finish The Princess Test and clamor for more, but if you are not familiar with Levine, you may wonder what all the fuss is about."
3,The Princess Test,"This great story i read was called The Princess Test written by Gail Carson Levine .It was an intresting story. I think that you should read this story if you like fairy tales. In this story , Lorelei, a daugther of a black smith , has to go throught many test to go the prince that she wants. I picked this book because it looked like a good book to read.The Black smith's daughter has to go to the prince Nicholas' castle to take many test to see if she will marry him.Many other princess came to take the test too. If you want to know how the story ends than you have to read the book."
3,pretty good,"This book is good for the SIZE of the pictures which are large. Most of the full page shots are 9""x13"" and some are centerfolds. Unfortunately the picture quality is not consistantly professional grade. I would have given this book 4 stars had the photos been digitally enhanced."
4,Underrated solid horror,"""Lost Souls"" has been dissed by many critics, but it is really a fun entertaining film filled with arresting images, and some real chills. People unfairly compare this to the Exorcist, when it is really not about exorcism at all, but the AntiChrist theme going on. Its not bad for its type, and is really improved by the performances of the brilliant Winona Ryder and Ben Chaplin. Its not perfect but is sure to please fans of the genre."
2,"Scary, but somewhat confusing and bizzare...","""Lost Souls"" was the movie that I had anticipated the most, though did not live up to my expectations. Though it was scary and interesting, the movie was confusing from the start and took almost half way through to figure it out. The filming was very well done, and so was the plot, but if only it had been more explanitory. And another thing was that some scenes were just plain stupid, and could have been done better. The only thing that keeps this movie from a one star, is its suspenseful scenes, and its story. Otherwise, you've got yourself a twisted movie with hard to hear dialogue, a confusing start off, and a ending that makes you say ""What? That was it?"""
4,A Devilish Thriller,"Definately worth seeing, because of the excellent cinematography, and the sheer thrills. As compared to ""The Exorcist"" the film falls short by a long shot, but shows its audiences that you don't need some Linda Blair-esque teenager coughing up vomit and speaking in different languages to add increased thrill factor. The ending was a little weak, but the film successfully completed its goal. The audience will have to decide what the goal is, however."
1,Save your money and your time!,"""Lost Plot"" would be a better title to this stinker of a movie. The first half of the film is so slow you'll find yourself looking and your watch, and wondering what I might be missing on television tonite. Besides a few ""look I made you jump"" moments, the rest of the film will leave you scratching your head in confusion. And the ending is so pitiful you'll feel sorry for all the fools that actually paid money to see this thing in theaters. I like Winona Ryder, but she should really read the script before she agrees to appear in a film. If you still think you want to buy this dvd, don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,Omen + The Exorcist but didn' work.,"First of all, this movie is directed by Janusc Kaminski, director of photography from Steven Spielberg's Schinder's List, Saving Private Ryan and Amistad so how bad can this movie be right? Turns out to be real bad. Compared to this, Similarly theme also from 2000, Bless The Child (with Kim Basinger) looked like a masterpiece. This is a bad movie from beginning to end. Confusing, and boring. Wait until you get to the ending, I really can't believe the way the movie ended. The only star I gave for this DVD is for the outstanding sound quality (Both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS included). Get the Omen instead. Like already mentioned earlier, the not so good ""Bless the Child"" shines compared to this junk. Avoid this DVD !!"
2,A Disappointment to PoSeSs,"This movie was a letdown. The plot/story was interesting but itdoesn't deliver. It's predictable in some spots (the ending mostshamelessly, it ...). Winona Ryder plays an experienced exorcisor when her and her allies (John Hurt,some other guy) confront this man (John Diehl) who keeps penciling numbers downon paper, (he's locked up in the looney bin and he;s requestedto be exorcised.What happens next is a letdown, you don't even get to see what'shappening,just the aftermath.I can't think or remember for that matter any good scenes in thisflick...oh when Ryder is in the ""head"" and she sees XES and the toilets overflow..thats about it.Rent it first I didn't like this clunker at all"
1,Anti-climactic,"This movie was indeed a disappointment, mostly because it had a pretty decent build up, but when it ended, I had to see the credits rolling before I realized it was over. I expected more, and although the ending was unexpected, it was abrupt and left me asking...""yeah, so?""For a better movie of this genre, see ""Rosemary's Baby."""
2,How do they think of this stuff???,"Spurious ""Biblical"" quotes (New Testament ""Satan"" in Old Testament book-interesting!) Melodramatic farce-Ben Chaplin goes from stoic cynic to psycho network prospect in record time. Long reviews are boring though, and so is this movie."
4,sa majeste,"this hit is a typical african beat which would easily appeal to any african.the animator does his thing so proffessionally while madilu himself with his booming voice speaks in the background. the guitars are well done and it is generally a wonderful piece of adaptation from african folk/traditional music and modernising it to keep with times. i keep on repeating it from time to time,that i do not know how the second song sounds like."
1,P.U. !!!,"My girlfriend & I wanted to enjoy a scary movie together. But we were duped when we watched LOST SOULS. I became bored out of my skull and she was more scared of the rain & thunder outside. As many have already stated, this movie tries to put itself into the ""Exorcist"" genre of horror - however it will do more for insomniacs than for horror fans. It's just plain bad!! It tries to be artsy with droll colours, intrinsic camera angles and cinematic twists - however the outcome is a boring and depressing movie (and I personally never liked a film that tries to be DARK by using so-called creative lighting & lack of bright colours - a la BATMAN). It's such a sin since I've always enjoyed the acting of Wionna Ryder. But in this film you care nothing about her character or anyone else in the film. Avoid this film at all costs!!!!"
1,A WASTE OF FILM!,"I rented this movie thinking it would be good, it was horrible. the movie makes this huge build up and there isn't one, I don't recommend it, you'd be wasting your money, if I could get back the two hours of my life from watching this that would be great!"
1,One star only because there's no turkey category here...,"I wasn't expecting much after reading the reviews here but even the worst reviews didn't prepare me for the extremely bad ending! Many reviewers promised the movie had atmosphere & style,and I guess it did have some of that, but what a disappointment! At best, the ending was anticlimax; at worst, an invitation to religious nuts to justify horrific acts. If I could ""unwatch"" this movie, I would."
5,NO [P] SOUP FOR YOU!!!!,"A BRILLIANT vision from the mind of director KAMINSKI of the 'other side' taking over ..... after all as it is said in this movie ""If You Believe in GOD .... you have to believe in the devil {capable of manifesting physicality}"".It's an odd sedate little journey starting with a botched exorcism .... and along the lines of a film-noir the clues to more and more horror are slowly peeled away until the 'innocent' is convinced by the ordinary that he is the chosen one ......RYDER, CHAPLIN, KOTEAS, HURT spearhead this dark journey - beautifully lensed [almost black and white color]; sound direction is excellent as is the powerful score.FOR something different about old nic, try this one on for size, but be cautioned, there's no pea-soup or spinning heads, just the dread and awakening .....of all sorts of possibilities .........."
1,Lost Souls??? More like Wasted Rental,"Well, the movie was not at all scary. The plot was subpar at best. Nothing about this movie was worth the cost of the rental. I like Winona Ryder as an actress, but she could not save this movie for me. The story really goes no where. You are left at the end wondering what in the world have I missed. I cannot fathom that a movie actually was worse than The Ninth Gate, but this one makes Ninth Gate look like a the Scarface of horror movies."
2,"good movie, bad ending","I saw this movie in theaters, and I left disappointed. Not because of the movie itself, but because of the ending. It literally ends at the climax. They can take the story so much farther, but choose not to. There's no sense of finality. The plot lacks any falling action between the climax and the conclusion.I would recommend renting this movie, but not buying it. You'll just be disappointed."
3,"Winona, you need to choose better scripts","Okay. I love Winona Ryder as an actress. I remember her in Heathers and Beetlejuice and basically grew up with her. My God, her choice of movies nowadays is going down the tubes. She seems to have a fascination with ""the strange and unusual"" (taken from Beetlejuice), including her choice of movies.As for Lost Souls, I was expecting something very dark and terrifying. Boy, was I disappointed. I was not afraid at all. There were times where I almost fell asleep. The cinematography was good, the acting was decent, but the story was lame. It simply lacked creativity and that sense of terror that every good horror flick should have.The ending was disappointing. Granted it left much to the imagination but it also left enough open to create a sequal.....if the movie producers would be foolish enough to do."
2,Great Concept/ Bad Story,"The concept of the movie was good but, it was written and acted out terribly. The possiblities were endless on what different angle's they could have went with this story, and it's too bad that the one they chose was awful. This movie most certainly wasn't scary at all, and it had some parts were it got a little boring. I also found the ending to be a let down in fact, it was kind of weak. I thought that I was going to get to see her participate in exercising the demon from the guy but, I didn't even get to see him get possessed. Winona Ryder is a phenomenl actress but, this movie was a disgrace to her talent."
2,Pretty Bad Movie,"At first sight, this looks like a good film that is worth watching. With this film, first impressions are definitely wrong. The plot is decent, and some of the individual actors/esses aren't bad, but the film barely hangs together. I love the films of this genre, but this one was a definite stinker and a no buy. Save your money and time...don't bother with this film."
1,0.25 STARS: Very disappointing attempt at a horror movie.,"""Lost Souls"" was a very disappointing attempt to make a horror movie...I thought the movie ended with a resounding THUD illustrating just how bad this movie was as a whole. If you want to watch a good movie regarding the horror of the ""antichrist"" then watch the classic horror movie named ""The Omen"", which is one of the greatest horror movies of all-time."
4,Good Movie - Good Acting,"""Lost Souls"" may be a little dry for horror fans, but I thought themovie was well paced and managed to avoid the normal clichesand cheap scares.If they added more exorcisms, gore, and special effects, I'm surehorror fans would have been raving over this movie."
1,I gave it a one because we cannot take away stars,"I usually love Winona movies but somebody must of picked out this script for her. It was like letting Mommy dress you. The scary shots was that guy possessed and it was all bad sound effects and angles. It wasn't scary, but rather I found it to be funny. If you are looking to kill time, it's as good as any other movie but if you are looking to be entertained, pick a different Winona movie."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad Of 'Lost Souls'","This was a fairly good ""Devil"" story and certainly worth renting.The film had decent suspense until the end and good cinematography throughout. Kudos to the writers for pointing out there IS a Satan and converting a non-believer to that fact. Winona Ryder looks very pretty, too, as good as I've seen her. This was before her real-life problems put her in the news and her career took a nosedive. Also the profanity is pretty low in here.***Possible spoiler**** The bad things included a somewhat-disappointing finish; some skewed theology; typical cliché scenes where a person should have been shot but the shooter hesitates way too long and is stopped; and priests winding up as villains.Overall, Lost Souls is a pretty good film and could have been really good with a tighter script and a little more suspense at the end."
3,What About the Ending?,"Okay, I won't pretend this was the best film I've ever seen, nor the worst. It didn't scare me, but it was bizarre. I think horror has lost its true meaning with the guts and gore slasher films we see, which is why I appreciated the suspense with this film. At first, the ending seemed bland to me, but then I got to thinking that the movie had another motive. It made me wonder about the contents of the movie; was Peter really the devil or not? Sure, he had the makings to become one. But what about Maya? Consider the facts: her parents died while she was 13; she solved the puzzle herself and went after Peter; she was also possessed at such a young age; and the mental patient seemed insistent on killing her; she had the vision of the number XES. It's a shame this could not have been developed further; but as they say, it's just a movie."
3,"One Word, One Name....PHILLIP BAKER HALL....","Phillip Baker (...) Hall -- the whole reason I saw this movie. And he's great in it, fabulous - wonderful as he usually is. Folks he is a great great great actor, you should go see Hard Eight (or any other of PT Anderson's Films) and Secret Honor (Robert Altman) for some great Phillip moments. Anyway loved the look of the film, story was nice...I'm not to sure on the execution though. The ending, as is usual with an anti-christ film these days is predictable, but I liked the way it was carried out. Check it out, its not a waste of time...Gorgeous Gorgeous cinematography from Kaminski. Give this guy a good story and he will do wonders in the future. Someone to watch for. If you like Stigmata, you may like this, but as with all art, all opinons are subjective...so don't take my word for it."
5,Coco Lee (the best english/mandarian singer of all time!),I love this CD. I thought Reflection was the best song on this CD. Everything else was pretty good.
5,Ni hao!,"I, being a 9th grader learning chinese,love this CD! It has a little bit of everything...pop, hip hop, r&B...u name it! It is a mix of Chinese and English....Changlish! U have to hear it 4 yourself!"
1,she's not all that...,"i truly believe that she's doesn't have what it takes to be any kind of arttist. she's got no personal style or creativity. just browse thru what she call ""lyrics"" written by her. it is very obvious that she's just one of the product produced by our society, a follower, not a leader."
4,Nice package,"Sanding discs and drums aplenty, along with an assortment of buffing wheels, make up much of the 185 pieces. Replacements for several of my worn-down grinding tools as well, along with several mandrels. A handy collection, at Amazon's special price."
1,Item substituted,I spent a lot of money for this item and they substituted a teddy bear that had no t-shirt and no curly hair. It sure looked like the teddy bear that other merchants are asking less than half-the-price for. I have yet to be reimbursed for RMAing it back to them and UPS shows it was delivered 2 weeks ago. To make matters worse there was no offer to reimburse shipping for returning their cheaper substitute item. Avoid this item & company.
2,Flimsy and Cheap,Very thin plastic not like those thick clear lucite keychains it seems to resemble in the picture. I'm always worried it will break in two in my pocket.
3,Johnny's great big kiss-off to the bootleggers,"Thunders gets to be his own living legend on this album -- he introduces most of the songs here by flipping off the critics or tossing an expletive deleted -- and the performances are a real mixed-bag of studio and stage performances. He veers from snarling put down (""Who Needs Girls"") to sensitive troubadour (""Diary of a Lover"") to drug-addled guitar-slinger (""Great Big Kiss"") in a virtuoso display of bad-boy behavior. Worth it just to hear Johnny's New York yawp, and, like all great legends, proving why he's one-of-a-kind."
1,Buy Cottonelle Aloe,"I had been ordering Cottonelle with aloe, but suddenly Amazon stopped carrying it, and offered this instead. It is an extremely poor substitution. It is overly thick, and I do not find it soft at all. Back to the grocery store (and not the online one - too much delivery charge)."
1,GO TO TARGET!! TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!,I got the 24 double rolls for $10 (on sale) from Target . This price is double.
1,Superflow portable air compressor,"Tried 6 times and each time the compressor blew the fuse out, so it was sent back to Amazon the next day."
4,A good buy,I was surprised at the performance of the compressor. It is sturdier than my old one that recently died and it cost less. The only negative is the screw connector. It was a little difficult to get the threads to line up at first but with a little practice I managed.
1,"broke my fuse, no quick connect air hose","I bought this one a couple years ago, but not really use it until recently. I connected it to the 12v power outlet of my car, and it quickly blew the fuse of both of my cars. I now use a separate 12v battery to power it. It also misses a quick connect air hose, a lot of air just leak out when I unscrew it from the valve. I am looking for another air inflator."
3,Company out of business? Buyer beware,"Mine worked great until it just up and died about ten months after I bought it. Amazon warranty was only 30 days, and the manufacturer (DV Innovations) seems to have gone belly up (disconnected phone number, web site now blank) so buyer beware. Wish I had used my AmEx for extended warranty, hindsight being 20/20."
2,"Pump's OK, but accessories suck","The pump works well. The parts that come with it are junk. The air hose has a threaded fitting on the end, which is OK for cars, but miserable for bikes, which is why I bought it. The fitting is hard to attach and remove, and most of the air you've just put in bleeds back out. It's a frustrating, repetitive process. If you want it for bikes with higher pressure tires, just accept that you'll be off to the local NAPA store for a hose and fitting that work, which will cost about the price of the compressor. Also, the bag is complete trash. Figure on tossing it, too, and getting something durable to carry the items."
2,Got some issues here,"The compressor sometimes stalls if you try and start it after connecting the airline to the tire first. Oh, and when it stalls it will also blow the fuse to the accessory outlet in your car. I also find that now after a couple months the quick connect on the air line to the compressor leaks a large amount of air unless I hold it and keep pressure on it - the included air line is a piece of junk.On the plus side the compressor is solidly built, runs very well off my battery charger, and is faster than the combo emergency light/compressor I intended to replace. But I can not count on it to run off the car due to the stalls and blown fuses, so it remains n the garage, where I would have been better of with a 120V unit."
1,Defective,This compressor blew the fuses out in two cars. This is a seriously defective item.Kudos to Amazon for their easy return process.
3,Finicky?,"I was attracted by the reasonable price of this item. Like some other reviewers, the first time I tried to use it, the unit blew the fuse out on the minivan. It did work when I plugged it into another car, but what a hassle... Also, the cord is stiff, making it difficult to stretch to the full length. So a quirky little product with some value -- purchasing again, I would go for a larger, sturdier unit."
1,Past Problems Not Fixed,"As reported in other reviews, it blew the cigarette lighter fuse on day 1. I was disappointed that this known problem had not been fixed by the manufacturer. Even though I was able to return it easily enough to Amazon, I think it should not be purchased or sold unless the manufacurer specifically guarantees that the problem noted above by many users has been fixed."
2,Bad Parts,The 12V plug fall apart when I open it. I think they use cheap plastic the think just fall apart to pieces. I mean pieces. I didn't bother to return end up buy new parts for $5.00 replace it myself.
4,Good Animation Cam,"I wanted to do a claymation video, and on TV anything more than 640x480 is wasted. This camera has a feature that no other one in its class can match: a macro setting for extreme close ups. It has a standard tripod screw mount on the bottom.The only drawback is the interface. You address this little beast as a TWAIN device, like a scanner. That limits the software than can read from it, and the included software is only OK."
4,decent cheap camera,"640x480 can do alot. Wish I could add memory. Wish it worked on Linux or Macintosh. Closeups work well. It's also fast. You can take about 1-2 pictures a second for capturing some action. 640x480, gotta be close. Also small enough to carry everywhere."
4,A very nice digital camera!!,Maybe you are looking for a great camera..Maybe you may need a super camera.. but..If you only need a camera to take pictures and download to your pc.. only need a camera to take a casual pictures on the way and you no are a professional camera man... this is perfect to you!!I only need a camera to take pictures and not expensive.. the quality for me is very good... i just want catch the moment and this camera do this for me.. and its perfect...If you are looking for a cool camera to take pictures and have a cool time.. this is a good option...remember you can make your life easy this camera help you to do it!
1,Toe tags and TNT,"This was an average book. It was somewhat entertaining at times, but a little outlandish. The most frustrating part was that the book had tons of spelling errors or grammatical errors. F.eg. on page 2 the word"" to,"" instead of ""too."" Eventually, there were so many errors that it became a distraction from the book. I was actually hoping that it would be funnier, but was terribly disappointed. I would not waste my money on this book."
3,disappointed,"Once again, I have purchased a DVD with palm trees on the front cover and there is not one palm tree scene on the DVD. Even on the selection menu, there is a beautiful picture of a blue sky with palm trees. I would have loved to have seen that on this DVD. There are mostly scenes of waterfalls and streams in a forest, however, there are a couple of ocean scenes, but for me, they are not that great. Sometimes they seem to be in slow motion and out of focus. The scenes are constantly changing, which I love, and if one scene seems blurry then the next one is better. There are 2 scenes of Ayers Rock. The music is beautiful and sometimes seems angelic. This DVD didn't have the scenes that I wanted so that does influence my review."
1,who authorized this??,"Where do I begin ...First the video sucks. Very grainy in some clips. The riders are very good, but its to a deaf ear due to the management. Basically its a home video that does not give the sport its dues. Overall ... it goes to the grill. I'm gunna burn it :("
3,Offers simplistic ideas,"This book lives up to it's promise of offering recipes and activities for a father and son, but nothing that I hadn't really thought of (in some variation) before. The recipes are definitely somewhat original, but again, nothing ground breaking or especially unique. For the price, it's worth a look, as perhaps it may provide you with more ideas that it did for me."
5,Another great Creative labs product..,"This is the second Creative labs product I have in my Computer. It installed in less than 5 minutes, and was easy to setup. I am running it under Win NT, so I play no games with it, but for everyday use, a wounderfull product. GET IT!"
3,Focus is on applying numerical codes,"What I like about this book is the breadth it provides on the art and philosophy of groundwater modelling. It is really about the practice of applying existing codes, there is very little detail about the theory behind the codes. There are numerous examples mostly using FDM (MODFLOW, PLASM) and occasionally FEM codes (AQUIFEM-1), and lots of discussion on things to keep in mind. There are whole chapters on (1) boundary conditions (2) transient models and (3) conceptual models which I thought was great. There is a useful discussion on water balance too. There is very little however on unsaturated flow or solute transport, both of which get only a few pages in the last chapter."
4,Great book but the cover fell off due to poor binding,A great book for explaining the essentials of groundwater modeling including governing equations and statistical evaluation of numeric modeling. I just wish the publisher could produce a book that the cover didn't fall off within the first couple months of use.
2,Dont waste your time.,"Save your money, this DVD's resolution looks like it was shot with a low def cheap camcorder. The lighting is bad. Each scene opens up with the cheesiest fonts, and they don't go away for a few seconds, getting in the way of trying to enjoy the scenes."
3,Needs a good Photographer,"Portions of this you are left watching a leaf with rain drops for serveral minutes, at first you think, yes pretty, but then you think, okay, let's move on now. I think they timed it with the music, which actually ruins the whole scenery. I'd prefer they didn't try to imagine what we like to listen to. Just jungle noise would have been more peaceful. Pretty, can't deny it, but not relaxing."
3,Relaxation Video,"The seller was excellent on this transaction. The Virtual Relaxation product is, for me, acceptable. However, some may find it a 5-star rating. The reason that I am not that pleased with it: I would prefer nature sounds (as in my previous VHS version) instead of music and wording and skipping through various scenes."
2,Not Available in Widescreen Format,"Too bad. Really pretty scenery, resolution's not the greatest, but the music is decent"
3,A fun Costume.,"This costume is fun but lacks the essentials! I wish it would have included the white tights, hat, wig and sword. I felt like I still had half the things to purchase after the initial purchase of the costume. I love the big tongue flaps for the shoes. So cute! I also wish that it had pockets. It does look flashy though. We received tons of compliments."
2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY...,"Well...wait..yes I do---I like her ""Intro"".Oh...and nice artwork but baby gurl needs to fine tune (SERIOUSLY)... her vokals. WOW, WOW, WOW and did I saayyyyyy WOOOOOW!Sounds a tad, smidgett, bit, ummmm tintzy-wintzy like Conya Doss (a much better singer) but even MORE 'nasally' (i.e she sings through her nose as does Conya) but to top that...off--her high 'hits' (can't even call em' notes) are wayYYYYEEEE off. She sounds as if she is straining to pull it off.ALL I CAN SAY...IS WOOOOOOOWWWWWW-UH! She does have potential but not--no where..not even even clooooooose to put out a CD.First impressions are a mess and a killa'. For me this was a mood killa'Hopefully she'll get better. I'd hafta hear her on some other avenue (free) to try that again. I am always lookin' for new talent so I bought this off a friend 'used' for $8 but it was not worth it to me.WOW!!!"
5,Easy to use,"I bought this before a deployment while in the Army and I loved it. No wires to mess with while downloading music and it can be add to almost any computer as a generic storage or jump drive. Very light weight, very compact, and very easy to use."
2,Stylish junk,"This is a very compact unit, using only a single AAA battery for power, with a built-in USB connection for downloading music. Unfortunately, that's where the compliments end.I've found this device to be unreliable and generaly flakey. Some music files cause playback to simply freeze, requiring a ""reboot"" (unplug the battery) to continue. Often the unit will simply stop playing ""for no reason"". The tiny amount of power available from the single battery is insufficient to produce any kind of volume, even on very efficient headphones. Operating at higher volume levels (more than 3/4 of the way up) results in the unit shutting down after a few minutes. Even the most efficient external speakers elicit the same result. I would expect that all of the other MuVo TX family members are just as flakey, but this is the only one I've tried. I wouldn't recommend this unit or any of it's siblings to anyone."
5,MP3 player,I've had a few MP3 players..This is my best selection..Quality is GREAT..Battery last much longer than many other brands...A Great player for sure..
4,good to have a granny,"good book, started one way ended another, just when you thought you knew who did it and why , buy it , read it, enjoy it, i did"
3,Bittersweet....,Book started off amazing but then it started to lose me...I was like what the what...but it was an ok read and yes i'll recommend it so it wasn't that bad after while..
3,okay but missing..........,"Marissa is a woman who loves men, sex and money. Shortly after Marissa starts working at a strip club several of the club's dancers are murder. Marissa meets and falls in love with Travis, a preacher who has secrets of his own.There are several other supporting characters and the author does a great job intertwining the characters and creating a interesting murder mystery. However, where the story is great on mystery it lacks in romance and character development.There was absolutely no chemistry between Marrissa and Travis. I neither liked nor sympathized with any of the characters. Although I did not care for any of the characters I continue to read as I wanted to know how the murderer was and how they were revealed.Would I recommend Baring it All to a friend? Only for the price of $.99. There are better written mysteries out there."
5,Action and HEAT!,This book was excellent with the right dose of drama and steamy erotica. I hated the book to end. The title was befitting the book.F. Loston
4,My thoughts,This book was nice Gena Garrison did a very nice job. Not many grammar errors. I'm glad I took a chance with this author
4,A decent substitute for seeing her live,"This disc is a wonderful substitute for seeing Loreena live. What you miss on the studio album is the wonderful musicians who work with her. She calls them her ""idling Porsches"" and she isn't joking. It is truly joyous when they all get to just jam on the second disc."
1,COBY CX-9 is Junk!!!!,"This radio does not recieve signal, even a known strong 50,000 Watt station. Reception is terrible. The contrast of the station/clock screen is horrribly light (with no way to adjust contrast). It is almost impossible to see the screen. You get what you pay for! Cheap Junk!"
3,PROP. 65 Warning,"The CX-9 I just received has the warning:""PROP. 65 WARNING:Handling the coated electrical wires of this product exposes you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm.Wash hands after use.""This is a bit disturbing."
3,It works,"Not impressed with the overall Skuttle design for the humidifier, but it works and I've replaced mine easily a few times over the last 10 years."
3,No Wicks included.....,Received all my 6 pads but non of them had the small wick that goes in the water dispenser.......Can you please send or tell me where to get it?
3,Laid Back and Unpretentious,"But a lot of fun at times. All of these selections were recorded live in a small (and extremely relaxed) radio studio. The results range from charming to just sloppy. It's particularly refreshing to hear a different side of the more well-known performers (Muldaur, Danko and Kaukonen) without the usual bells and whistles. Muldaur's performance is particularly engaging. At it's best, this CD makes you feel like you're sitting in the artist's living room, a friend more than an audience member."
4,Lovely voice.,"Wonderful voice, lyrics and rhythm--a true talent. I love the passion in her voice. The only thing lacking is a concert here in San Antonio, Texas (hint, hint)."
2,Very mellow,"This album is more mellow than her previous ones. I loved the Drive album, and Beautiful Collision is okay as well. But this one... I just have a hard time distinguishing one song from the next. I definitely preferred her earlier work. Still love her voice, though."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I loved both Beautiful Collision and Drive because they work so well together. Each sounds just different enough, allowing me to like one better for a while just to favour the other again. At least I could find a very nice balance between the two.Birds is somewhat like Drive, but unlike Drive, there's nothing really special or quirky about it. It's Drive mellowed down and gone bland. Bic's voice is still pretty of course, but Birds sounds just awfully flat and the songs predictable."
4,Getting Better,"Bic is getting better with each release. It is hard for me to hear such a mature album from her, I expected something a little younger. I think the fact that she produced this one herself allowed her to include less ""single"" oriented songs on this album. It is not cookie-cutter by any means! That also explains why it was not released in the USA. Right now I like the beginning of the album better than the end - but I know eventually I will flip-flop. If you like Bic, you will like this album. It is less cutesy and more bluesy than her others though (in a good way)."
3,Fascinating book but not as pictured,"This is a hardcover copy of Suez to Singapore (Cecil Brown's story is interesting), but I was disappointed that it didn't come with the dust jacket pictured. No dust jacket at all, just the hard cover."
4,great book,this is my first time reading a robert ross book and i loved it. the book keeps you entertain from beginnig to end.
5,Compassionate Healing,"I was more than pleasantly surprised when I started reading this book. The title gave the impression of it being primarily a book about health and wellbeing. It's so much deeper than that. The actual mysteries of life are dealt with head on: birth, aging, sickeness and for many the most difficult--death. The stories of people overcoming all manner of illness, were truly inspiring. I found I was reinspired to use visualizations coupled with chanting in a very natural way. Every page is infused with compassion. There is a wonderful, warm feeling of being embraced by the universe and how powerful we really are. This is an important book. I immediately sent copies to many of my friends upon finishing it. What a gift!"
1,Stops working after a few months,"I bought this battery in June of 2008 and just one month later, my computer no longer recognized the battery. I contacted Oncore and they replaced it with no hassles. Unfortunately, the battery died on me again 11 months later. It is again no longer recognized by the computer, so it is useless. I can put my OEM battery back in and it works (but with a shorter life) so I know it is not the computer. When this battery works, it works great, but it has been very unreliable and I would not recommend this battery because of these problems."
2,Country Music's Greatest Songs?,"Though the songs may not be the 100 I would have chosen, I love this little book. The stories behind them are well-written, with background on both the writer and the original performer(s). The only problem I can see is that there are only 100! Here's hoping Mr. Collins produces a second volume, because the first is great."
5,great deal for quantity and pricing,"If you use Trojan Magnums, this is the best deal I've found. You get a large quantity for a much cheaper price. My boyfriend has a slightly larger girth and length and this brand definitely fits him better. We both like it because it gives a smoother feel. However, I do think it's a bit thicker than the regular size."
4,Great for the price,"Loved the price on these condoms you can't get them that cheap anywhere, but when opened individually there is a rubber smell that I just do not like."
3,whoops,"Personal lubricant is evidiently a must with these, or they can snap and break. Also, they apparently stink like rubber, in a not so sexy lingering sort of way. But obviously they are a larger size to fit larger men, but not all larger men? Not that I would know. I mean, I don't use them personally (not a guy). Just going by what I've heard. (?)"
1,Waste of time and money,"As resident in general surgery, I am currently a student of upper endoscopy, I was keenly interested in an atlas to improve faster and make quicker, more reliable diagnoses in the endoscopy suite. Keeffes book will not help me very much in this area, though. The endoscopic pictures in the atlas are of a very bad quality and can't really be compared to the ones encountered in the endoscope. I would not recommend this book at all."
2,Buyer beware,"Have used Picture it for years and loved every version a little more with each version, until now. The Picture It Photo Premium in high tech terms [is bad]. Looks good, installs well. But it lacks a lot of the standard flexiblity in previous versions. I was expecting a lot more and got a lot less!!!"
5,"So easy to use, everybody should get it","For simple photo scanning and editing tasks at home, Picture It is one of the best packages around, and it's truly very easy to use, yet not condescending like Adobe's offerings. This new version sports a cleaner interface and fixes a few old bugs. Recommended."
4,Chemtronics CW8100 NO CLEAN FLUX DISPENSING PEN CIRCUIT WORKS 0.32 OZ.,"Product works just fine. Used it to remedy a PS3 YLOD. You have to coax the flux to flow under the CPU/GPU by tapping the felt tip on the m-board, but it wasn't too troublesome to use."
2,"You have to clean the PCB,",when you use this flux pen. I don't know why but it leaves my PCB board dirty. I work on lots of low ohm devices like 0.1 ohm +-1% and this pen induce problems if I don't clean. I don't use this pen any more for sensitive PCB job.
4,Ancient Egypt The Great Discoveries by N Reeves,"A well written and though out book by Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves. Basically, this is a chronological listing of important Discoveries in Egyptology. This is a good book for the student and layman. As an Egyptology student, this book was helpful to highlight interesting areas for further study. 2 minor negative comments are: the body font appears too spread out for easy reading and size of the Font too small. However, in general, Dr. Reeves book provides excellent content to guide the scolar and enthusiast."
4,Ignition Coil Replacement,"Saved me over $200 to order for myself online...came in great condition and was able to install it with a car saavy friend's help. Shipping was an issue, the company messed up and put the wrong address so I didn't get it for two extra days, after paying rushed shipping. Not very happy about it considering its a car part and those are generally needed right away. However, saved too much money to complain too much."
4,great basic soundcard,I bought this card for my kid's computer and it was excellent. Easy to install and haven't had any problems
2,Drivers are unreliable,I installed this card in a new home built computer. When I got Windows XP installed the sound came on and sounded fine with the generic drivers provided by Windows XP. I then proceeded to install the drivers that came with the sound card. After installing the Creative drivers I discovered the sound on some of my games was distorted. I rolled back the drivers to the generic XP drivers and the sounds returned to normal. The only problem is I have no access to the advanced features in the audio control panel. I can adjust volume control but I have no way to adjust the treble or bass or other effects. If I reinstall the Creative drivers those functions return but then so does the distortion.
1,Bad out of box board,"I installed per instructions, beign always grounded with a wrist strap wired to live ground circuit. When I turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard. Took it to local tech who said newly installed board was bad and caused the motherboard to short out. Ruined computer!!!"
5,Does not work for Dos :(,This pci card works but unfortunatly i needed it to work for DOS games and it does not. My mistake i overlooked the model number.
1,Still Won't Work,"I have installed, uninstalled and reinstalled the CT4740 numerous times and it still does not work properly in a Win98 environment. Customer support is minimal at best. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Not a good option,"I recently bought a SB16PCI and have not been pleased with the product. After upgrading to a new CLUS2 I815 board, I realized my old ISA soundcard was not going to fit into the new system. Since I had spent a lot of money upgrading the computer already, the SB4740 seemed like a good option for a basic card.However, try and find support for this product is nearly impossible. Windows 2000 professional drivers are non existant and Windows ME drivers do not seem all that stable. For a basic product that has been around for years, you'd expect better refinement.Finally, the audio quality is OK. Pretty much what you'd expect from a low end sound card. Save yourself the trouble and move up to one of the better soundcards."
3,Ok for the price and basic functions,"This is a basic low-end sound card. It puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer. It comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your cd-rom drive so you can rip your cds directly from the cd-rom. The drivers are included for all windows including xp.Why you wouldn't want this cardIf you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp3 (over 128 bitrate), 128 or less will sound fine with this cardI don't understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windows"
1,Terrible performance,From the very first time I put this in my PC it didn't work as it should. Tech support was useless. DO NOT purchase this junk!!
1,Why do they still sell this junk?,"Way overpriced, way under-useful. I would give it NO stars, but that doesn't seem to be an option. In the past few decades that this card has been available (only a slight exageration) there have been great improvements made that this old piece doesn't have. You want to get a different card unless you have no desire to play any sounds besides MIDI files."
1,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I have purchased Sauder products directly from Sauder many times and have been very satisfied, however this one must have fallen off the truck. Had a hard time lining up the doors even though the cabinet was put together exactly as it should be. Some pieces weren't marked well or at all. Some holes were pre-drilled in the wrong place. I never could get the locking mechanism to line up right so I just left it off. Also, the booklet that came with it stated that the top won't support ANY weight which you won't find in the online description. Won't buy anything like this online again. Do yourself a favor and drive to a brick and mortar store were you can touch the cabinet and check out the quality yourself."
2,Cheap,"This cabinet is very cheap. While I knew it was made from vinyl coated press board, it's still not very well constructed. The doors do not line up properly, the plastic angle brackets that hold on the bottom of the cabinet are so cheap, the broke off the first time I tried to move the furniture into position, and the locking mechanism takes up half the shelf space on the first row. A single misaligned door scraped a good chunk of the vinyl coating off the ""wood"" the first time I tried to close it, because the cabinet was unstable and was listing to the right. No amount of touch-up can ever fix that blemish. So, beware. I would not purchase this unless you are really hard up for cash, though for nearly $200, you'd think it'd be a bit more quality."
1,Review of Bleuette: The Doll and Her Wardrobe,"I purchased the combination of this book and another, thinking I was going to receive an extensive collection of Bleuette patterns. Instead, I got coffee table books with only a few patterns drafted by the author, rather than the original patterns. I found the advertising text misleading, and would not have ordered them had I known I was not going to get real Bleuette patterns."
5,Exact part but cheaper cost,This filter fits a 2005 Honda Accord V6 correctly! What's not to like about a filter that is priced cheaper than local cost.
1,Dot-Fraud,"This repetitive book spends many pages repeating the same points over and over. It's short on substance, harping on the same cliches of ""exponential growth"", how old economies are supposed to be wiped out by the new class of dot-com billionaires. He spends most of the book having you believe he is some sort of authority on artificial intelligence. When he finally discusses artificial intelligence at the end, it becomes obvious he knows nothing about programming. e.g. he thinks programming is done by changing 1's and 0's. The author also thinks homeopathy is the future of medicine."
1,Really Mr. Martin ! ! - this will not do,"To state that this book is a disappointment is an understatement. For an author who claims to be a technology guru this is a mish mash of whimsical fantasy. It belongs in the realms of bad science fiction. Martin never really explains what this alien intelligence really is - we are left to assume this is some form of intelligent or sophisticated software. There is really no theme to this book but a random selection of Martins thoughts and bias. He gives no supporting data, facts but relies on quotes, unlikely scenarios and just plain fiction. Interestingly, this book is an unsophisticated attempt and update of Martins earlier work - `The Wired Society"" - both editions of this earlier book never mention the Internet.One last bad example can be found on the back cover - the CEO of Headstrong Inc, Mr. Patrick Litre gives a glowing review of the book - but readers do not know that Mr. Martin is a significant shareholder in Headstrong Inc."
2,Like an infinite loop in a bug-ridden computer program,"It's a fascinating topic that I was very eager to learn about. So far, I've read that alien intelligence is different than human intelligence and will grow at ""electronic speed"" (whatever the hell that is). In addition, I've read that alien intelligence is different than human intelligence and will grow at ""electronic speed""I actually agree with this much, but after sixty pages, I feel like I've read ten pages six times over. I give it one star for the first sixty pages and a second star just in case he says something more than ""alien intelligence is different from human intelligence and grows at electronic speed"" during the final 200."
3,Could be a great book,"This book would be great for some lite reading, if all the repetition was weeded out. This would reduce the book to about 50 pages. This book will inspire you, but you will have to do all the work yourself since there is no technical information, or URLs for where to find it."
3,Great slang - if you lived in Japan 40 years ago,"I bought this book to try and learn some more ""colorful"" Japanese. However, when I asked my Japanese wife (born in Japan and just immigrated to the US) if the book was correct, she said that a good number of the insults were from when she was a child in the 1960's."
3,Are you going to Cornell?,"If you're going to Cornell, this is a great book. If not, it can get a little annoying. The author goes into great detail about his particular school.... This is all wasted effort for anyone not attending Cornell. It is not a bad book and has some good advice, but there are many other books on the market that are just as informative--and most are shorter!There are too many personal opinions from one student who might not even be practicing now just a few years after school (yeah, I did a search). Other books contain more of a consensus or at least are written by people with more experience.I have read a handful of these books with highlighter ready. Most of my books are filled with markings, but this book has only one web site highlighted. It is a good starting point for those who have not read any such pre-lawschool books, but is not very informative to those who have already done some research. Even if you are only going to read one book, I would choose another."
1,Judge this book by it's title,"This book can easily be judged by its title. It's long and boring. I read this book after reading ""Law School Confidential"" so I admit, maybe that was why I didn't enjoy it. ""Law School Confidential"" covered all the same things in an easy-to-read conversational tone. LS Confidential was written as though a big brother was giving advice. ""Law School Insider: The comprehensive blah blah blah"" was written like a text book. Instead of a friend giving me useful advice it seemed like Jeremy Horwitz was a lecturer who liked to use big words and didn't like so much to get to the point. I concede that the information in this book is valuable...if it is your only source, but if you are trying to decide which book to buy, go with ""Law School Confidential."" LS Confidential offers excellent study tips, multiple anticdotal advice and will leave you feeling excited about law school instead of feeling sleepy."
1,What a piece of garbage!,This is the first and only online review I've ever been inclined to write. I gave this Castle to my daughter for her fifth birthday after she begged me to buy it for her. That was yesterday morning. She loved it - but half a day later and the support beam has snapped off (broken and not repairable) and the staircase came off and the thing could no longer stand on its own. My daughter is generally not rough on her toys. When will I ever learn that most toys by Matel are of such cheap quality?! DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!
1,Magical Dance Castle Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses,"The Magical Dance Castle is very attractive and my daughters enjoyplaying with it. However, it is cheaply made and does not appear thatit will last long. Also, the design is for it to be placed in themiddle of a room for access to all sides, but this takes up a largeamount of space and unless you have a huge room dedicated for the castleyou have to continually set it up at take it down. You cannot place itagainst a wall for use without closing up half of the set and making ituseless. This significantly cuts down on the usefulness of the castle.It would have been better designed with more sturdy supports anddetachable sections so that it could be used in different settings suchas in the middle of a room, or against a wall (where it could not onlyserve as a children's toy, but also as a room decoration when not inuse)."
3,not great,"I paid $30 for this around Christmas, and even that amount of money seems too much. I had to buy a huge plastic bin to put the ka-jillion pieces in when it is not being played with. It's a not a very sturdy construction. But my daughter loves it and spends many hours in make-believe land, so that part, at least, was worth the money."
2,We returned it,"This item is so cheaply made that even my four year old, who loves Barbie and all things Dancing Princess, wasn't sorry to see it go back to the store. The plastic is flimsy and the accessories are very poorly constructed. We bought it because we liked the idea of two sides, giving both our daughters a side to play on, but the construction was so awkward that it didn't fold open all the way nor would it close properly. It just seemed so cheap, even by today's kid toy standards. Very disappointing, but at least now I know that the Playmobil prices are well worth it."
3,A bit Wobbly,"My daughter absolutely loves the Magical Dance Castle. I thought the instructions were a little vague sometimes on how to put things together, however we got it done. Now with energetic 5 yo and 3 yos playing with the castle, I find that it is prone to tipping. The ""balcony"" side is lighter and isn't heavy enough to counter the front and so the legs that support the balcony slide toward the front. But it is a toy and my girls don't seem to notice. I wouldn't have paid full price for it, because it is definitely not worth that much."
2,cheesy,"I agree, not worth the money. Too bulky...doesn't fold for storage or anything & too flimsy, I expect my grandkids to have this broken very soon. I only bought it because my grandaughter requested it for Christmas."
1,this castle stinks,"This was SOOOO not worth the money! The design is terrible. It is meant to be used from all sides and is just not practical unless you have A LOT of room in your playroom for such items. Also, it is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. The whole things wobbles, the support pieces fall off, and you can't move it once assembled without it practically falling to pieces. It is garbage. My daughter (age 4)who LOVES 12 dancing princesses and everything to do with it, hasn't played with the castle in almost 2 months now. I wish I could still return it. Save your money!"
1,What a Flop,"The Magical Dance Castle is large and cute but cheaply made -- one wall is even made out of cardboard. More importantly, it comes with a musical dance stage with stands to hold 3 Barbie Dancing Princesses but we have never been able to get the stands to work. The stands fall out and the dolls fall over every time. Very disappointing."
4,Love It!,"I purchased the Magical Dance castle for thirty dollars, also. My 5yr old niece loves it. At the price I paid, it was a steal. The castle is large and has alot of neat features. (She demonstrated how the spiral stairs and bed(s) nest together, how the musical dance platform works, etc) I went online today with the intention of buying 2 more, but the price has gone back up. I would have been disappointed had I spent more than fifty dollars... I completely agree with those who said the msrp is too high for what you get."
2,who approved this design?,"Whoever okayed this should be spanked and demoted.It is the cheapest thing I've ever bought. The steps don't stay open and the pillar is super wobbly. The background won't stay up in the arch (yes, it is up in there all the way and inside the notches)."
2,Try to talk them into a sturdier doll house or castle,"I wish there were more reviews before Christmas;I would have thought twice. I can see I'm not the only one who bought this because my daughter really wanted it and then I was disappointed. She doesn't know any better and likes to play with it, but she's 4. As a consumer and an adult, I am disappointed. Thicker plastic and side walls for support would have made a big difference. I don't think it will last long. Luckily, my daughter also received a Fisher Price Doll House from an Aunt. It wasn't advertised like this Barbie castle, but once they were both set up, my daughter ended up playing with that and liked that better. It is sturdier and has great components that work unlike the stands in the castle. I feel ripped off. If you can talk your child into another doll house or castle, do it!"
4,My girls enjoy it,"Fairly easy to put together, even in the wee hours on Christmas morning. In my opinion most toys aren't good quality and don't stand up to play. For the most part this toy seems to hold up well, except for the stairs which fall off if the castle is moved and dont stay staggered (they want to fold together in the manner they were shipped)"
5,Shining like a knife...,"I liked the comparison that the introduction made between the thinking of Yosano Akiko and the High Moderns like Eliot and Pound. For all that they were working from different cultures and probably entirely different world views, I think that Akiko shared with them that kind of glittering precision that makes her work very pure to read-- particularly the Tanka.I was a little bit less impressed with the selection of ""Modern Poetry"" that came after the Tanka. I'm not sure whether it would have been true of all her non-traditional form poetry, but the poems chosen for this section were not nearly as strong as some of the others, and honestly seemed as though they'd been chosen to illustrate her political thinking rather than the body of her aesthetic work.Also, compliments to Shambhala Publications for the lucid translation and for the non-irritating introduction. Everything seemed just enough and well done."
2,Not worth the cost,"Candy is not sour, like a previous review said, I had about 5 red in the tin. Candy was sticky when opened, and for the $14 it cost (w/ shipping) I will not order again."
2,Not Sour,Not nearly as good as I remember them. Not sour at all. Fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. Only 1 or 2 cherry sour candies in the can. I'll stick to Zotz (also purchased on Amazon).
4,anecdotal western history from a real westerner,"This lengthy memoir contains enough interesting contemporary history from a westerner who helped make history to keep even those not interested in politics reading. The Nevada chapters are wonderfully evocative of life and times in the Silver State before it became America's Adult Playground, and Laxalt's account of the fall of Ferdinand Marcos and its aftemath is gripping. Through it all, the author manages to remain self-effacing and affable: I found myself liking him even when I didn't like his conservative asides. Laxalt's rue-laced account of how two anti-big government Republican governors created the Tahoe Regional Planning Authority is not to be missed."
5,An absolute must read!,"We use it every day, several times a day -- the humble flush toilet keeps our homes clean, safe, and odor-free. This amusing little book has the wondrous history of this most wonderful and humble of household objects. You'll never look at your toilet in the same way again."
2,Bizarre Plot... but with a few too many Zzzzz's,"Beautiful, mysterious scenery, gorgeous cinematography, great acting... only one thing missing... a truly good reason on why this plot deserved almost two hours of my time. The fact that ""Mararia"" looked pretty couldn't hide the fact that the pacing was incredibly sluggish, so much in fact that ALL THREE of the people I was watching this film with fell asleep at various points of the movie. This could be attributed to sleepiness, or the fact that the movie has that affect on people. Despite the fact that you empathize with the characters, the plot twists keep plunging deeper and deeper into the bizarre and disturbing. The finale seems out of the blue, without a real lead-up, or genuine character basis, taking away from all notions of empathy we had for anyone onscreen.If you happen to like this kind of strange, surreal psychological mayhem, you might actually enjoy this movie, if it doesn't make you want to take a nap through most of it first."
2,Cheated out of Chiba,"This movie does not showcase Sonny Chiba's martial arts skill. Streetfighter was probably his best. This film has relatively few fight scenes, and they are nowhere near par with Streetfighter. In addition, the fight scenes are shot in dim, dark lighting, or at angles that obscure rather than reveal the fighting styles.I bought the Platinum DVD version of this film, which was not the best transfer quality, watched the movie twice, then swapped it in with a used dealer."
2,How can you make Paris dull? Here's how...,"I was tricked into buying this book. It is being marketed as a general history of Paris for the traveler or Francophile. Unfortunately, it reads much more like someone's masters thesis. As such, it brings with it all the usual problems of academic writing. Here is a sample sentence:""In perfect anthithesis to this, phantasmagoria was an ideological mechanism of exclusion.""Sadly, there's lots more where that came from. This book was not written to entertain, inspire, or inform the reader; it was written to promote the author's erudition.If you're looking for a general history of Paris, I'm sure there are many other options that are more readable."
3,Action On The Ground And Above It,"This quick little programmer from Warner Brothers stars Lyle Talbot as a hotshot pilot (was there any other kind?) who finds himself mixed up in a plot to steal important government military information. His stewardess girlfriend Ann Dvorak also becomes caught up in the plot. However, character and dialogue aren't what this film is about. Like any Warner Bros film, the emphasis is on action, and director D. Ross Lederman provides the viewer with plenty of aerial action (and ground action as well). The movie moves along quickly and tightly and is finished in just over an hour. As programmers go, it is well done and entertaining, delivering exactly what you would expect."
1,Looks Great when you 1st get it.,I have had this on my car for 1 month. The logo has faded so badly that its almost one color now.
5,Necessary,Our little grandson is autistic and Frutol has been so amazing for him. We gave it to him for a long time and then stopped. Went back to it as it really makes a difference.
5,wasabi knives,"Excellent quality and sharpness. Have not had them long enough to see if they will hold their edge, and/or easily re-sharpened."
5,Truly the best of this legendary man's music,Fabulous! Just plain fabulous! What a force for wonderful changes this man made in his short time here. I'd recommend this to anyone who ever loved his music.
5,The beginning of the Fourth wave of black metal?,"I must admit (rather embarrasingly) that I did not know who Akercocke were when I picked up this album. A friend of mine informed that they had been really hyped, something that I somehow managed to miss. So on to the music then.At times, this reminds me of old Mayhem. Tortured, rasping screams on top of blasting drums and frantic guitars. At other times it reminds me of Immolation, Sadistik Exekution...but still with an air of freshness to it.Being a black metal fan, as well as a CD-reviewer for a Swedish fanzine, I'm always overjoyed when I find something I like; something original. And this is original. Akercocke couldn't care less what you think of their music - or at least that's the feeling I get. If they want a female choir they use a female choir. If the want a cello, they use a cello, etc. If you want original, hateful, agressive black metal, then you want Akercocke."
3,"If you ever liked 70's funk jazz, you'll like this.","Great mellow 70's funk jazz. Great horns. Nice mood. A couple of cuts stray a from the cool instrumental theme of the album, but with cd's it's easier to deal than it was in '77."
3,"Funky, Well-Done Background Music Is Still Background Music","Not for nothing was the Crusaders' 1991 major label finale called ""Healing the Wounds."" This talented jazz-funk group, which individually played on some of the seminal albums of the 1970s (Steely Dan, Billy Joel) and influenced any number of others including AWB and Parliament, seemed to constantly suffer dissension and tension even while its trademark New Orleans-Memphis sound grew mellower.No exception here. ""Free As The Wind"" lives up to its title; Joe Sample's light-fingered electric keyboard work and Stix Hooper's drums lifting what soon would be called ""smooth jazz"" airborne with disco-based rhythms. Some of the old-school, slow funk returns on ""Feel It"" and ""Nite Crawler,"" (featuring some excellent horn charts throughout) but generally this is among the mellower, most nondescript albums in the group's catalogue. Better off with the funkier sounds of ""Chain Reaction,"" ""Southern Knights"" or ""Royal Jam,"" the live album with BB King."
3,"""Chain Reaction"" and ""Live at the Lighthouse '66"" are better","If you are new to the Crusaders, you would be better served to buy ""Chain Reaction"" as your first album or get ""Live at the Lighthouse '66"" before you get ""Free as the Wind"". It is a good album but doesn't seem as tight or have as good of a funk groove as the other two."
1,"Poor look, QA and service","I received this item with 2 driver's side front pieces but no passenger's side front piece. I contacted Putco for assistance in re remedying this issue but received no response. I sent these back and ordered some AVS (AutoVentShade) visors. At least those arrived with all the right pieces. Not to mention the ""chiseled"" look of the Putco model does not go well with the curved body lines on the 02-05 Rams. Definitely happier with the AVS visors."
5,Hi & Dri Anti Perspirant Deodorant Roll On Unscented 1.5 oz.,Could not find this product anywhere where I was able to previously buy it! Could not find another brand that worked as well
2,Good Production But Poor Video Quality,This is a good production of the opera but unfortunately the video quality is poor. Many of the R.M. Arts releases seem to have poor video quality and if I had know it was an R.M. Arts production I wouldn't have bought it.
4,As we stand here waiting for the ballgame to start...,"Albert Brooks is known today as a film director and comedic actor, but he did stand up comedy at the beginning of his career. This CD features a performance from 1973, where he tells humorous remembrances of being an opening act for Neil Diamond and Richie Havens, and does a hilarious routine about a hypothetical open audition to write a new National Anthem. Other than the live performance, he throws in a few bonus bits, including two (intentionally) unfunny prank phone calls. The album ends with ""Comedy Minus One"", in which Albert plays one half of a comedy team and the listener performs the other half (a script is provided and there are pauses in the routine where you are supposed to say your lines). It you like the films of Albert Brooks, you will probably enjoy this album, too."
4,A Classic - too bad you can't get it...,"Bought a cassette for five bucks from some Amazon partner. Wish I could have found a CD. This was Albert Brooks's first comedy album. Without Albert Brooks and Brother Bob Einstein (aka Officer Judy, Crazy Dave and currently on Curb Your Enthsiasm) there would have been no Steve Martin, no Andy Kaufman, no..."
2,disappointed.,"You have to watch a video everytime you go to play the game and there is no way to save the child's game. You have to re-enter the child's name everytime and it then starts a new game. game relys a little to much on a child's ability to manage a mouse, as that is all that functions. My son is better at the keyboard and using the arrows, so he gets frustrated with the game. It is to bad he can't use the mouse to practice sometimes and when he gets to frustrated or tired of that go to arrow keys or keypad. All in all I would't recommend this product, just based on the fact that you have to start a new game everytime."
1,Superfluous and Incomplete,"85 of the 120 pages deal with the use of specific statistical procedures, with brief comments on the meaning of selected output. Most of that will be better covered in the statistics text which the reader should have. The software itself has menus that are easy to use.There is little information about data manipulation and NO information about editing output, yet these are precisely the things that a novice user of SPSS needs advice on.There is no information about interactive graphics, which was the major innovation in Version 8. The book has no index."
3,Great for quick reference,I use SPSS for evaluation research and have found that it is the perfect reference tool to find out what type of test I need to use and how to use the menu and syntax methods for data analysis.The keywords in the title are SIMPLE GUIDE. If you need to learn how to do statistics or learn what some statistical terms mean this is not the book for you.It is a great book for individuals who have had intermediate statistics classes and have some knowledge of using SPSS. It has helped me more than any other stats. book I have.
5,The definitive book on Bodie!,"Bodie: ""The Mines Are Looking Well . . ."" is the first comprehensive, serious history of the famous old California ghost town. The author, Michael Piatt, spending two years of his life directly involved with Bodie as a California State Park Aide, leads the reader through a century of gold mining history beginning in 1859. The book, like no other, provides comprehensive details on the mining activity that took place in Bodie! Lavish photo captions, fascinating sidebars, and extensive endnotes are as interesting as the text. The book also contains many photos never before seen in print. Anyone interested in learning about Bodie and its principle industry should begin with this book. An amazing historical compilation of what took place in one of California's Old West ghost towns."
3,Good acting lacks the original spookiness,"They picked good actors and go through the motions well. If you did not see the original it could hold its own as a standard blob from space movie.Basically something comes from space and holds a small town at bay. You must ask why and how this could happen. Maybe you will still not get a clear answer. However it is mostly ""stay in the car scenes.""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (Color Special Edition)"
1,SLEEP INDUCING,This is basically an unnecessary remake of a 1953 classic by Ray Bradbury. This lackluster version offers nothing new or exciting; there are no real scenes of suspense and most of the performances appear phoned-in. The special effects are cheap looking and unimpressive. Truly a waste of time.
3,"Slow, plodding but good special effects","This could have been a good movie, if the directing and editing had been better. As it is now, it moves at a very pedestrian pace. The conclusion is very good however, and the special effects are good throughout."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic book! I read it in German when I was 12 years old, and now, 20 years later, I still remember it being so great that I just bought an English copy. Can't wait to read it in its original language. It's one of the most remarkable books I've ever read (and I'm reading at least 1-3 books every week). Highest praise."
2,Not worth the money,"I was surprised and disappointed by how cheaply made this toy is. The gold post-toppers stared falling off just taking it out of the box. The horse tips over constantly, and the reins don't stay on. The carriage part feels very flimsy, and it comes apart easily too. My 3-year-old rarely plays with it."
2,Pass on this one,"I bought this carriage for my two daughters (ages 3 and 4) for Christmas. In my opinion, the toy is poorly made and does not fit the manufacturer's recommended age of 36 months to 8 years at all.The horse does not stand due to close placement of the legs and a raised hoof. The gold tips placed atop various parts of the carriage have all broken off. Had I not known about the target age when I bought the item, I'd assume the carriage was made for a much older child who would either move it very slowly or keep it on display.Moreover, I would like to know how the manufacturer envisioned all the dolls fitting into the carriage in anything other than an unnaturally stiff, corpselike position. Barbies are not fully articulated and, thus, a ride to the ball looks like a reenactment of scene two from Monty Python's The Holy Grail (Bring out your dead!).Recommendation: Avoid this item."
4,Overall good- - - could use a little more stability,"This carrige nicely holds all of the 12 Dancing Princesses when fully expanded. The only problem is that I can see it breaking where it expands if my daughters are not too careful! They love this toy, though!!"
3,Holds many dolls!,This product is fine if your child is still into her Barbie dolls. Mine unfortunately is growing out of all her Barbies and has not used it too much. I thought this would be an excellent way of reviving her interest since she has enough dolls to fill up this carriage. But she has hardly looked it this item since Christmas.
4,Dancing Princess Carriage,"I feel that this toy is good for the imagination of a little girl playing with Barbies, however I think it would be most enjoyed if the child has an adult to play with her and help her expand on her imagination."
2,"PYLE PLTAB12 12"" BASS TUBE REVIEW","this so called ""800 watt"" bass tube MIGHT be using 100 watts(its advertised as 600 but has ""800 watts"" written on the speaker). the frequency control is really just another gain control. if it isnt turned up to 90% or better you cant hear anything. the same goes for the gain. when i turned the gain & frequency both to 90% the sound quality was poor & wasnt loud by any means. i purchased this attempting to replace my 8 year old 200 watt 10"" bazooka tube. my bazooka tube even being 8 years old and having a smaller woofer is more than twice as loud, hits twice as hard & is much cleaner sounding. i was being very lenient when giving this item a 2 star rating. 1 star was for its quality appearance & the other was for the fact that it did power on & does work. it should have been advertised at 80-100 watts rms so that very little was expected. with ""800 watts"" written largley in the center of the subwoofer it makes your expectations much too high....save your money!"
1,this is a pile alright,don't waste your money. i don't care how cheap it is. all you should consider paying for one of these is the value of the box. it being rated at 800 watts is a joke. the only way this thing will put out 800 watts is if it gets struck by lightening. i put it in a boat with 2 - 6 1/2 inch speakers and they put out more bass than it does. STAY AWAY or you too will fall prey to false advertising.
5,Worshipper in Spirit and in Truth for God is looking for worshippers such as these,"Matt Redman is phenomenal and is insight on worship is not only gripping and reverential unto God, but undeniably true. His exposition beckons all of us to yearn for more of God and to make Him our first love. His music is a testament of that as well, and his heart of purity shows forth in every song he writes and every message in this book."
4,Excellent book on true worship,"The heart of world's best new worship leader is evident in ""The Unquenchable Worshipper."" This book allows you to see the man behind the music and my respect for Matt Redman has grown. Before I only knew of Redman as a great songwriter. Now I see him as a great worshipper who writes worship songs. The only problem is the short length of the book. Matt definitely leaves you wanting more!!"
5,"Simple, but Powerful!","I've never read a book that took me to another level, besides the bible. If you're struggling in your life and you feel like nothings going right, read this book, and find out what worship is all about. It changed the way I look at my relationship with Christ."
2,"Whole book, three words: interactivity over features","This book definitely has a drum to beat, and it's around the value of interactivity over just pure featuritis. However, it goes on and on, littered with what feel like pseudo-scientific statements. It would've been nice to see a few studies of real people, research citations, or even just opinions of somebody other than the author. It felt like he was rewriting the evolution of software over time from his own frame of reference, and then extrapolating about where he thought it was going.Still, there was at least one point I agreed with; interactivity (and, in general, providing value to the user) is more important than additional hanger-on features."
2,Too full of fluff,"If you're looking for a book with over-abstracted filler written by an author with ulterior agendas and a need to use his thesaurus and high school history books to prove his intellectual capacity, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book that can be more readily applied to interactive design, look elsewhere.Granted, a few of the chapters provide insight into smart design principles and distilling down what is essential to pleasing the end users, but books comprised of a few chapters don't sell very well in today's market of thicker-is-better tech books. Another annoying deception is the copyright date which shows 2003, yet the book is chock full of obviously outdated references such as the lack of web users with broadband and being able to watch full-motion video on your home computer ""in the near future""."
3,Interesting.,"Overall, the content is interesting.The sad thing is : due to the lack of external references, it's very difficult to connect the knowledge corpus developped with works outside of Crawford taxonomies.Worse, he explicitely writes that he's trying to 'educate' us on the subject. Sure, we have search engines and all, but as far as I know, nothing replaces a library and relevant pointers.In the beginning, he states that some scholarship material will without any doubt emerge and be more .... well... Scholar-like. That's (in my point of view) a very poor excuse to rip some reference pointers. Taxonomies don't appear ex-nihilo.But again, it's a good read."
4,"Cute, practical outfit","This is a great outfit to have. It's wonderful for hot weather but can be also be worn with pants when it's colder. I liked carrying it as the backup outfit in the diaper bag because it's small. And rompers are always cute, even when they're plain.I think the sizing is standard, not extra-small like Gerber clothes can be. My tall 19-month-old son is wearing 2Ts in most brands and the 24-month size of this romper fit him until very recently. It would still fit if he weren't so long-waisted. I'm disappointed that I can't buy him a 3T."
5,Great upgrade.,"My first ""permanent"" air filter was for a seldom used, performance car. It was essentially a one-time purchase for the car. I was pleasantly surprised how noticeable the improvement was in the breathing of the engine. One-by-one I replaced the filters in all of my cars with these types. When you plan on keeping the car for a while, used slightly or often, the cost of the filter becomes cheaper than a periodic replacement of a paper filter. The performance, and possibly gas mileage improvements are definitely worth it. If you use the filter for more than 50K miles, it does need to be cleaned, but the benefits still outweigh the inconvenience of this job. I would recommend any permanent air filter over the paper ones."
1,Simply doesn't fit a 2000 Sebring,"This item simply did not fit within the filter housing on a 2000 Sebring JXi. It is a good half inch too long.Looking at the filter, it looks like it would work well if it fit. But, cannot test it as it does not."
2,Not good for larger breasted women,Not a lot of support and the clasps are not easy to do with one hand. I would not purchase this again. Too much money for the product and I got one at Target for $16.00 that is a lot better in the support and it is easier to use with one hand. Sorry.
2,Not worth the money,"I hate the clasps, although other people may disagree. It is much easier to use the bra-hook type that I have on my nursing bras, since I have spent my life unhooking those with one hand! I also hate the openings under the bra flaps - they are too small. This tank is very comfortable, though, for sleeping or daytime. The elastic under the breast is very soft and wide, which I like."
2,room for improvement...,"I have the long top, which is very slimming in the tummy area. However, there are some serious flaws in this top which are not exceptable, considering the price.1) The straps are very difficult to adjust and are too long.2) The clasps are very akward to refasten-not good when you are at Starbucks with an infant in you arms!3)It doesn't really have support for larger breasts (DD now that I'm breastfeeding)"
3,Not that great,I thought for the money and reputation that this nursing top was going to blow me away. I think it's uncomfortable (too tight - even when I got one size larger). It has good support and good quality - but don't think it's comfy. I like the Target Nursing tops for 1/2 the price.
2,Awkward Shape,I was looking for cute nursing tank tops and saw these advertised in a magazine. I went ahead and bought 2 and they were a huge disappointment. They were short and unflattering. They were so unattractive that I actually donated them to a second hand store.
2,You can do better than this,"These bra tanks manage to be both extremely stiff/tight fitting and NOT to provide support. They are also very long - actually enough to be considered a tunic. You'd be better off with a good nursing bra and cotton nursing tank. Also, on-line shoppers beware: Glamourmom has a very restrictive return policy. Tanks can only be returned within 14 days and TOTALLY free of any deodorant, lotion or other stuff that normally gets on clothes when you try them on. They suggest trying them on right after you shower -- as a mother of two, I can tell you it's tough to fit in a shower, let alone trying on clothes afterwards. You can do better than these tanks."
1,Not worth it at all - itchy and uncomfortable,"I bought this tank with high hopes, but am very disappointed. While the exterior material is a nice quality, the interior parts - the ones that are against my skin - are horribly itchy, especially the edges. Some of it is even made with plastic elastic that scratches. It's actually so uncomfortable that it's distracting from everything else. The fit is fine and I really like the length, but look somewhere else for better quality materials. I am have never had sensitive skin or been bothered by material or clothing, so this is specific to this garment. Also, this is only the second product review I've ever written, so I'm not just bored. Sorry, Glamourmom, please make your clothes with more than glamour in mind."
5,Convincing Description of Armenian Gencide of 1915,The Slaughterhouse Province writen then Harput U.S. consul Leslie A. Davis is very convincing book that then Turkish-Ottoman government commited genocide on Armenians. The counsel describes his eyewitness account of 1915 Armenian Genocide in the Harput Province (one of historiacal Armenia; presently occupied by Turkey) The genocide perpetuated on Jewish people during 2 nd world war and very recently on Rwanda's Tutsi population by Rwanda's Hutus. Thus genocide is not someting that belong distant past but yet actual. This book is a must be read book for every one concerned with Genocide....
2,An okay book,"A love story with underlying themes of the effects of prejudice and the power of love to overcome it. The main characters seem like total opposites, but as they develop the reader learns that the two are not so different. It is an okay, though somewhat fluffy story. I would recommend it for a boring, dreary day, but if you can find a better book then you should go for that. If it is a nice day outside, skip this book, save it for a day when boredom sets in."
3,Not That Good,I love reading love stories and theres only a few books I haven't liked and this book is one of them. It was an okay book. Danny was kinda lame though for letting his brothers and friends talk him in to breaking up with Raven. (His girlfriend) I thought Raven's brother Doberman was cool and the story should have been about him instead.
1,"Domestic Cookery, Useful Receipts, and Hints to....by E.E.(Elizabeth Ellicott) Lea","There only were a couple of pages downloaded. It showed a couple of recipes ,but not worth the bother to download."
2,Buyer beware.,"This cookware is NOT made by All-Clad. This cookware is made in Korea (All-Clad is made in Canonsburg Pennsylvania, and is not up to All-Clad standards. There is a big difference between this and the LTD line of All-Clad pans. While this set might be better than, say, Farberware, it's not All-Clad. It's not professional cookware."
1,don't buy it!!!!,"This set is awful!!!! There is nothing that seasons these pans, everything sticks and burns no matter how much oil or butter you use. We have the non-stick Emerilware and love it. For 2 cents i would throw this in the garbage."
3,The quintessential second-rate composer,"The previous reviewer is right in everything except his or her rating. ""Over-all enjoyable"" is right. But it's not thoroughly enjoyable. The first couple of pieces ARE the best, and the Hexameron is interesting as a historical curiosity (and VERY hard to find on recordings), but after a couple of pieces, my mind starts wandering as it always does with this composer, no matter how talented the pianist who's playing him. Let's face it, folks: Alkan is a typically bombastic, boring 19th century romantic who just doesn't quite make it. And let's stop trying to promote a ""revival."" It just ain't gonna happen."
2,some good songs- some lousy,its a cd s ss s s s s s s s s sssssssssss ssssssssssss ssssssssssss ssssssssssss s s s s
1,These shoes stink...literally,These shoes look pretty but that's about all they have going for them. The leather in the heal of the shoe has the worst smell. They arrived and at first I just thought it was because they'd been in a hot truck since it was 100 degrees outside. But the smell never went away. The shoes aren't comfortable and they slip off my feet. I normally donate my clothes and shoes that I don't want but I wouldn't give these to my worst enemy; they're going in the garbage.
3,Color issue,"I love these shoes, I bought the natural color, but it is NOT NATURAL. The color is more a golden antique color than the silvery color it looks like. It is a great shoe, but does not match what I hoped it would. But very comfy!"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I was thrilled to find these shoes online, as I thought they were identical to a pair of D'Orsay pumps by Anne Klein I already own and love , but to my dismay these are a higher heel and extremely uncomfortable."
2,Toe too pointed,"Not a lot to say, just don't like the pointy toe on these pumps. I wear a size 9.5 and with the extra length the pointed toe gives the shoe, I just didn't like the look. Also shoes weren't comfortable."
2,"We don't need a Guitar Man, son","After Elvis died, his producer Felton Jarvis erased the instrumental tracks from some of Elvis' songs and added new backing tracks. This was a misguided attempt to ""modenize"" Elvis. It was actually a moderate success. The remixed version of ""Guitar Man"" actually reached # 1 on the country charts. Tracks # 3 to 12 here duplicate the original ""Guitar Man"" album. The rest of the tracks are previously unreleased songs from the same sessions. If I had to describe what these remixed songs sound like, I would say that majority of them sound like '80s country songs. For the most part, it doesn't really work for me. To my ears, ""Burning Love"", ""Guitar Man"" and ""Too Much Monkey Business"" are pretty good, but everything else is basically worthless. Recommended for curiosity seekers only."
2,Worth a listen,"Familiar songs - different backings. Well worth a listen as they are different and provide an alternative listening experience to the original masters. Take ""Kentucky Rain"", ""Burning Love"" and ""I'll Be There"". Good production!"
2,CD title has a double meaning,"Why not over-syncopate the rhythms that Elvis Presley put his heart and Soul into, and add Allman Brothers' style guitar; speed up the tape - wow, maybe that's the way Elvis would have sounded...in 1981?""Faded Love"" made it onto a single - it came out o.k. in the reimagined latter-day post-production. ""Blue Suede Shoes"" is about 1:00 too long at 3:07 but it does feature it's composer, Mr. Carl Perkins, on the extended version of the 1969 live in Las Vegas cut.The boosted pitch and added echo do add brightness and verve to the proceedings, but I'll take a nice, clean, moderate remix on the originals, any time.With the time spent on this craziness, maybe they coulda come up with some lost Sun material."
3,"Stick 'em up, CD buyers","If you have a limitless budget for buying CDs, here's some Elvis for you. ""Guitar Man"" is the only song worthy of attention; the others can be found on other CDs with a longer list of other hits. You may even be able to get TWO other CDS for the same price. Be frugal. It ain't worth the bucks."
5,Very versatile pan,I own this as part of the 10 piece emerilware stainless kit. This is by far my most used pan. I saute cutlets in it and make a pan sauce from the fond that forms. I also cook risotto and braise in it. The heavy bottom distributes heat to beautifully caramlize onions without burning. It is heavy but I like this pan so much I even travel with it when going on extended trips with a kitchen available! All i need is this pan and my tongs and Le Creuset spatula if I had to choose out of all my kitchenware.
3,swivel has no stop,"This piece is very beautiful- the finish on the wood is really nice....However, when I swivel the TV towards the sofa it swivels right back to the neutral position. I have to put rubber coasters under to keep it from swinging back. So, it is not entirely functional."
5,John,"The TV swivel performs as advertised. One thing I did alter was that there were only 4 anti-skid pads to stick to the bottom so the swivel doesn't scratch the surface it is set upon. I bought a pkg of 6 more and stuck them on as well. The description stated it was for up to a 27"" TV. I have a 42"" plasma on it with no problem."
4,Great Product if you receive it!!!,"I ordered this item through Amazon Market Place for my 46"" flat screen TV. The company took its time to ship the product and did not communicate with us at all. They did not respond to Amazon's communication requests either. I finally received a shipping notice just when I was about to cancel the order. Once received though, I have to say, it is a well constructed beautiful product. It fits with our decor and it works effortlessly with the TV. I recommend the product if only you are a very patient person and if you are willing to wait (without any correspondence) until it is shipped."
1,Horrible,"Horrible!!! First, they never responded to Amazon.com's attempt to find out the status of my order. Then they never responded to my attempts. Ended up having to cancel the order after all the ongoing silence. Avoid them."
4,Very Enjoyable,It was a very good listen. I needed it for a music theory project and it was just perfect. Great recording!
5,Not just for cramps,"I suffer from Multiple Sclerosis and consistently have leg pain. Not so much cramps as it is just a tight, tingly, painful, irritating sensation that soars throughout my legs. I can apply this ointment and within minutes my legs will feel much more relaxed. I will refer this ointment to anyone who has MS. Thank you Hylands for your outstanding products in which have great success."
5,Great Stuff!,this works better than anything else I have tried for night time leg cramps. A real life saver.
1,Not for me,"I like the Hyland's Leg Cramps With Quinine very well, but I thought this would be a more natural remedy. It brought great pain to my legs and actually kept me awake longer. I have three tubes to get rid of."
2,Disappointing,I took prescription Quinine Sulphate until that was banned for leg cramp use. This product does not do the trick for me. Maybe my leg cramps are too powerful. :-)
4,Best description of marathon madness I have ever read.,"Prior to reading this book, I had dismissed the author as someone who just got loaded and made up a bunch of stuff. However, the first few chapters of Lono represent the best description of marathon madness of those times that I have ever read (I finished 6th place at the 1983 Honolulu Marathon). His insightfulness into carbo-loading parties and the running divorce lead me to believe that he first did his research sober and then crawled off to finish the book.It has given me a lot of new respect for Gonzo Journalism.And Steadman's manic drawings of a perfect match."
3,Very large!,"WHile I was aware that this book was illustrated, I was not aware of the fact that it is huge! I thought it would be an illustrated, regular novel-size book. Instead it's about A3 size, and very heavy.. The pictures are great and all but if I had been aware of the size of this book I probably wouldn't have purchased it."
3,The Curse of Lono,The book arrived promptly and in good condition. However it must have been sitting stored somewhere for a LONG time because it was incredibly musty smelling. I did everything I could to try to air it out and remove the smell but to no avail.
3,-,"Another hit by Thompson. If you don't get enough from the name or the assurances of fellow fans, you probably should start on other Thompson, not here."
5,Praise For Lono!,"Once again HST delves deep into the dark side of the human mind. Whether it's fishing for drugs in an airplane toilet or running over stray dogs in a drunken stupor, Hunter takes his reader on a wild ride through mysterious Hawaii. If you want to take a trip without the airfare (or the acid) crack open this oversized volume and enjoy."
4,Lono was here.,"I enjoyed this book! As a rabid Hunter Thompson fan, it was awesome. While the writing was fun and entertaining, I really like the full page art work of Ralph Stedman. It really was worth the price."
3,"Least known, but still in HST style","The problem with a writer like Hunter is all of his works are compared to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" Whether that is fair or unfair no one can decide. This book has all the workings of Fear, but doesn't carry the punch that work did. He gets stoned, drunk, and into trouble the way in did in Fear, while trying to cover the Marathon in Honolulu. The book was hard to get and out of print for the longest time, but any fan of Thompson will like the read. The Ralph Steadman illustrations are a compliment to the book, but the essential Hunter that ""The Great Shark Hunt,"" or ""Fear and Loathing On The Campaign Trail,"" made famous is missing. Some of it becomes downright boring at times. The book is hard to get and expensive, maybe not worth the price. Overall, if you are not a serious fan, you could avoid the price and find other works of his to read."
5,Excellent!,"Very nice edition (2005), on a glossy paper, hard cover, with album-size illustrations. Not too portable. Collectors must-have."
5,BEST FAJITA RECIPE EVER !!!,"All the recipes in this book are easy and absolutely delicious! The fajita recipe is my favorite and whenever I make them, my guests give me rave reviews. My husband won't get fajitas in a restuarant anymore because he says they don't compare to this one."
1,Wrong part sent,I ordered a set of lifters from Amazon. What I received was a single push rod. No big deal i order a lot off of Amazon and this was the first mistake. I sent it back for a replacement filled out all the paperwork and wrote a description of what was wrong. I waited another week and same problem wrong part sent. The frustrating part of this you cant talk to anybody to try and get this resolved.SO BE ADVISED IF YOU ORDER THIS PART YOU WILL GET A SINGLE PUSH ROD!!!
5,Cute Story,"Good story with plenty of play on words!Kids will enjoy this, and makes for a goos converstaion starter about preparing for going back to school!"
3,"I like the content , but not the quality, of the book","My daughter (in Kindergarten) likes to ask me to read this book for her. The story is good.However, after a couple of days, if not after 1 day, we read it, I found the center page is ripped off. I have to use tapes to ""fix"" it. My daughter was quite upset about it before I ""fix"" it, because she thought she made a mistake or something like that.Even books from chick-a-fila don't get ripped that easily.I was thinking $3.99 would buy her a book with OK quality in Amazon. But it seems not the case for this one."
3,Great book to help with anxieties,This was funny and inspiring book to read the night before school. It helped my daughter get over her anxieties about a new teacher and a new grade.
5,great for the last day of school,This book would be fantastic for the first day of first grade or the last day of kindergarten. In a first grade classroom the students can compare and contrast their experience with that of the student in the book. I love this book.
4,Works fine,"We have this baby working round the clock since last november with no problems at all. it has an alarm if a camera goes off line, freeze function, zoom and other useful things, and the price was right."
4,"Pyramid Lake, Nv","Good book that covers all the basics. I actually fished this lake while reading the book - in about 40 hours of fishing I caught (and released) over 100 beautiful Lahontan cutts that averaged apx 18"" with the big one reaching 27"". This place is the ""real deal"" and this book will prove very useful in navigating the fishing spots and gearing up to catch the fish. My only beef with the book is it should show a color picture of this very unique trout. Dan"
5,"A ""user friendly"" angler's guide","Pyramid Lake, Nevada is a world-class, trophy quality, Lahontan cutthroat trout fishery. Terry Barron's No Nonsense Guide To Fly Fishing Pyramid Lake is the complete and authoritative guide providing the angler with all the essential fly fishing information, history, and background needed to successfully fly fish this outstanding fishery. Edited and with a foreword by Jeff Cavender, this ""user friendly"" angler's guide covers everything from baitfish and flies to the best times to fish, to accommodations and how to get there. If you are planning to fish Pyramid Lake, begin with a thorough reading of Terry Barron's No Nonsense Guide To Fly Fishing Pyramid Lake."
4,"Fun, a little confusing but fun once you figure it out",I bought this for my 14 yr. old who loved the series..he did say it is confusing at first...but once you figure it out it is fun. I do not think 8+ (for the ages)is appropriate. It should say 10+....
2,"Playing this is an ""Unfortunate Event""",I bought this game for my son. It is a confusing mess! Each player is in charge of too many charecters and there are a ridiculous amount of rules. It is way too challenging to understand and even harder to play. What a shame...it could have been a fun game.
4,Book description,This book is a collection of short stories written by Ramiro Lacayo Deshón. The stories are everey day and historical events wiew throu common characters in special circunstances.
5,It does what it's supposed to do!,"There are so many products out there. And so many don't work--or don't work as well as they should. This scissor actually cuts beautifully, cleanly, and effortlessly. It's a 5-star scissor!"
1,Book review,"Personally I think this book is a rip off. It has lots of great designs, but the author only includes one category of design patterns. If you want the other two categories, you have to order and pay more cash for them seperately by sending a request to an address at the back of the book. I thought that all the design outfits that are in the book would have patterns, but it doesn't. I cannot believe that this author entices you with some fantastic clothes designs for the larger dolls and then says you have to dish out more money for two more sets of patterns listed as other catergories."
2,Nice Package; Disappointing Contents,"This set consists of two parts: (1) a book of photos of various fashion dolls wearing the author's designs, and (2) patterns for some of the outfits. The photos show outfits that are very boxy and amateurish. They reminded me of clothing I made for my dolls when I was ten. The few interesting outfits do not come with patterns. It seems that to get patterns for all the outfits in the book, one must purchase two additional sets of patterns; however, the box is large enough to hold all the patterns.The only pluses I could find in this set were the thumbnail biographies of each of the dolls, and the chart of the dolls' vital statistics.While the patterns are very basic, the directions are not, so this would not be good for a beginning sewer. The experienced sewer would not want to waste money on this.Had I been able to look this over before I bought it, I would have saved some money."
2,"A bit good, a bit bad","I really loved the designs and photos, but felt that the directions were too complicated for a novice seamstress such as myself. I was HUGELY disappointed when I realized that, despite the description I had read before buying it, the box didn't contain all 27 patterns pictured. I ordered the additional two sets of patterns directly from the publisher. I felt this was misleading, but I made the investment hoping that I would find something useful. It was about 5 years ago and I think I had to pay about $15 extra, which made the set a LOT more expensive."
5,Bought to use with our kids' InoTabs!,We bought this adapter for our Children to go with their InoTabs for Christmas. It works and is cheaper than the adapter that they sell for the InoTab! This is definitely a must for the InoTab. If not you will be constantly buying batteries! We have already gotten our money's worth in battery savings!
4,adapter,Bought this for my grandson along with a Mobigo for christmas. Now he can leave it on and not have the batteries die on him. Great extra
4,Came Quick,This came quickly and works perfectly with the V.Smile my son has. No more batteries needed! At last! Would definitely recommend.
1,Better off with a universal adapter,We bought the V-Smile adapter for the 2 v-smile products that we have and were quite let down by it's quality. The first one quit working after a few days and we exchanged it for a new one only to have IT stop working after 2 weeks. I might add that it was well taken care of and never handled by our children. The third time around we bought a Coby CA-969 300ma Universal Adaptor (at a much nicer price of $3.00 @ Amazon) and have been really happy with it. We also use it for other things as it is Universal and comes with a bunch of adaptors. Bottom line: Save your $10.00 and go for a cheaper universal adaptor.
2,Do Not Use For Vtech V.Flash - not enough amps,I bought this when I received a used Vtech V.Flash that was missing its adaptor. The product description was very misleading when it said it is compatible with other Vtech toys. This adaptor is only a 9V 300mA. The game console requires 9V 1200 mA. I did not know the amps that the adaptor could put out before purchasing.
3,Get a generic adaptor instead of the V Smile one,"I bought a universal adaptor at a ""big box"" electronics store at the same time I bought the V Smile game unit. The information is on the V Smile box and the game unit itself so you know which plug size to use. We've had both the adaptor and game unit for a year now with no problems at all, and my kids play it a LOT. I highly recommend an adaptor over the batteries -- if your kids like to play this, they will burn through batteries VERY fast!"
1,It's a scam to not include the adapter,"So, I 've purchased what I believe is a fine toy for my child, and now I have to spend over 50% of the toy's purchase price to power the thing? For a $5-10 item? My letter is in the mail to the product manufacturer, along with the toy. This is a scam perpetrated by many kid's toy makers, and I will no longer support it as an acceptable business practice."
5,Perfect! No more batteries.,Just really got tired of having to replace the batteries in this system. I jumped on this when I saw I could use this instead. Well worth the price. My kid has fun and I get to save a little. Bought rechargeable batteries for the remotes which have also been a money saving move. Would certainly recommend for the active gamer!
5,Excellent Charger,Works great with my v-tech system I was able to incorporate the system in my classroom at work. I am so glad to have the charger so now I don't have to rely on batteries. It arrived in new condition and very quickly I will continue to purchase from this seller in the future.
1,Save your money!!! Actually rate less than 1 Star,Save your money...I bought one and with 2nd use it stopped working and wires became exposed. Put electrical tape on unit with help of my husband and still didn't work. JUNK!
5,Well needed,"I read the other reviews about this adapter, people saying that it didn't work, but so far I've had no problems with it. It's definitely worth the $$ you will save in buying batteries for the VSmile.You can probably find a similar adapter at a Radio Shack or electronics store, but then you have to go searching for it and find someone to help you in a crowded store."
1,Piece of junk,"We bought the V-Smile for our 4 year old daughter for Christmas, and she plays it all the time. However, after going through so many batteries, I searched everywhere for this adaptor. It was great for awhile, but now it hardly ever works. I've found that if I unplug it from the back and blow into it, it fixes the problem, but only half the time. I guess we'll go back to changing batteries once a week."
1,RIP OFF!!!,Target sells this for $10 Why are these sellers trying to charge double???? Just do a google search for vtech ac power adapter target and you'll find it on their website.
3,Good,Book came fast and in good condition. Book is missing some inserts kinda upset about that. Now I have to try and get the inserts from classmates--huge inconvenience.
4,Handy,"Nice and concise and I love the medical Dx index in the back for cross referencing NANDA's to common medical problems. Makes it way easier to choose an appropriate nursing diagnosis. Most manuals work backwards, and I feel it would be most useful to have the NANDAs referenced by medical condition rather than having to think up what might be the most appropriate NANDA. Take some time to learn to use the book and it will be invaluable to you. Way better than large, text book sized manuals! It's not exhaustive but it gives plenty of useful information for care planning."
1,Not helpful !,"If I would have known how hard this book is to use, I never would have purchased it, and would have purchased a different nursing DX. book !!"
2,Health Science Library Editor's Recommendation,"Health Science Library Editor's RecommendationThis is an excellent text however we recommendPhysical Signs in Medicine and Surgery: An Atlas of Rare, Lost and Forgotten Physical Signsas it is the most comprehensive resource available for practitioners and students in the clinical fields. Whether you are studying medicine, dentistry, nursing, or veterinary science the answers to even the most difficult diagnosis are in this Atlas. After you begin to use it, it can replace a half dozen books that cover physical signs. This awesome clinical text and a scut monkey house manual are all you will need for even the toughest residency and you will continue to reference it for years into the future. It is the - Must Have Book - for learning differential diagnosis."
1,Nursing...,It's hard to review sice i didn't receive this item yet.I contacted goodwill and supposedly it was shipped on April 21. Still waiting....
4,Helpful Handbook,"The only reason this book is a four star and not a five is that you do have to learn to use it. It is especially beneficial when dealing with collaborative problems. The larger book was helpful in understanding the whole process of nursing diagnosis and what it is meant to convey; the handbook will suffice for most nursing care plans, rationale tends to be a student pre-occupation. The organization is alphabetic, very clear for me once you know the few nursing diagnoses that are NANDA approved. Carpenito gives clear assessment data that must be present to support the diagnosis and interventions that make sense to select from as appropriate to your patient. I have used the book since the 7th edition and own the eighth and ninth. The tenth is available and I look forward to seeing the changes."
1,Terribly laid out and unorganized,"I only gave this book one star because there isn't a ZERO star rating. This book is horribly unorganized. If there is a pattern to how different pathologies are listed in this book, I sure as heck didn't figure it out.This book's ""pocket size"" infers that it is to be used as a handy reference, the extra time it takes to actually FIND anything in this book is not worth the effort of lugging it around. Everyone I know who is familiar with this book has agreed with me that this book is horribly ""not user friendly"". I only got it because my nursing school allowed ONLY this book to be used during clinicals.SHOP AROUND! Find something better."
1,Waste of money,The only GOOD thing about this is that its small. Its totally confusing to follow AND there isnt any rationals. Make sure you get something with rationals. Makes charting easier
4,The Best Game Ever,"This game is the ultimate experience... You get music, wrestling, fun, street fights, competition, and the best record label in the world... Def Jam... all rolled up in this 1 game. I couldn't stop playing it all nyte. This is the type of game where even after you ebat it you'll still have that urge to just play again, and again, and again... My advice... go buy it... Play it all the time... Love it... I know U Will... Have Fun...MixJif"
4,Homoerotica,"Not only does this game have masive amounts of homosexual referances, but the shear act of playing the game has made me less inteligent. The combatants will literaly slap eachother around, obviously these people are too delicate to use a closed fist, until you have the chance to get on top and force your oponent to submit, to what only the devine knows. I supose if your big into Pop Culture such as Rapers, Gangsters, WWF, and homoerotica than this is the game for you."
2,Paint Chipped from Expensive CMT Router Bits,I ordered theseCMT 800.513.11 3-Piece Ogee Kitchen 1/2-Inch Shank Router Bit Setexpensive CMT router bits from amazon.com trusting their delivery system and CMT's excellent reputation for manufacturing excellent high quality carbide tipped bits. The CMT router bits came with their characteristic orange paint chipped off in places. This is very unusual and very disappointing. This is the last time I am buying expensive stuff from amazon.com
3,It takes a little work,"My son loved the Luigi that I got from a store, so I ordered Sally online after I picked one up in the store that didn't work. She worked for a day and then stopped and this was the second ordered one since the first one didn't work. That makes 3 Sallys!I bought one battery for it...but it takes 3...but I ended up not using it. Once I cut the seam and took out the plactic piece it started working. So I turned it over so the square was facing down, and it has worked great. Another broken one I have has to do with the batteries. I don't think they are touching exactly right still after I put them back in. I have one working, and I'm fine with that right now.My son absolutely loves them when they work, but you may have to take some time and lots of patience to keep them working. Or buy them at a store to make sure they work well before you buy it."
2,disappointed,"I ordered the Smack and Yack:Disney Cars Sally, Lightning and Ramone for Christmas. The only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was Ramone. Sally and Lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour, they wouldn't work at all. I ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on Christmas. I hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases."
4,Bill hates Bill,"I read this book and I got two things from it. First that the author hates Bill Clinton personally. Second and much more important, China and America are already involved in the new Cold War. Mr. Gertz has provided huge amounts of documentation to back up his claims. Mr. Clinton good president or bad? The verdict will be out on that for some time, but in light of the info in this book and other souces I have read, he really screwed our military up. So much that our situation with China has dangerous parallels to U.S.-Japan relations in the late thirties. It seems that Mr. Clinton and his administration has fallen for the kind of deception that Sun Tzu would be proud of."
5,"Chinese threat to peace, democracy and freedom","Bill Gertz has done a superb job revealing China's well-organized and financed attempt to undermine American democracy and militarily and politically dominate Asia.What is most frightening is the zeal with which Chinese nationals and Chinese Americans speak and apologize for Beijing's ethno-centric and militarist design. To them China's brutal occupation of Tibet and continuing threat to Taiwanese democracy are mere ""internal affairs of the Chinese state"". To them China's aggression during the Korean War and involvement in Cambodia's genocide (in which more than 2M innocent people were executed) are history that never happened.What can the world do about this dangerous nation?"
1,"The Russians, The Japanese, The Chinese, Who is Next?","First it was the Russians, then the Japanese, and now the Chinese; Who is America's next enemy, the Africans? This is a great book for those who are paranoid about their own existence and need to find someone to blame for their own problems in life. I have lived in America long enough to witness America's incessant need to declare an enemy. In the '80s it was the Russians, then in the early '90s it was the Japanese, and now in the new millenium it is the Chinese. Who are we going to blame next, the Martians!? When people see this kind of a response, they think I am a liberal; Well, let me tell you something I am more conservative than conservative America. This book is only popular because Americans need an enemy and this book gave them a reason to believe in one which shows you how stupid most Americans are."
1,Who's the threat ?,"Only read the first chapter... Sorry. As people criticize China without being there, I guess I have the right to criticize this book without reading it entirely. So I guess this is just another book about how China wants to conquer the world. Unfortunately, this is not the only one. Let's review the first chapter very quickly. It is beginning with US-(NATO) bombing of China's ambassy in 1999...Mmmmh...Let me see... Where is the threat ? Ah and China was focusing its anger against US through their media (May be a Chinese Foxnews?). Really strange these Chinese people. Then it continues with the China's Communist plan where we have details about how US is spying China's airwaves.I am wondering if the author has ever been to China or if he only relies on ""intelligence"" reports ? (May the same guys that found WMD in Irak ?).Unfortunately, this book is not available in eBook version, it seemed pretty funny."
1,"Bunch of hypothetical, overemphasized nonsense","...This book is just bathed in cliché. I think it's obvious westerners,and I mean, in particular Americans (although I am one too) have presumedideas about other cultures, in particular Asia, South America and Africa. Unfair stereotypes I would say. I think it's hilarious that a man is so DETERMINED to find any fault with other countries. ... Mr. Gertz, please don't waste your time. ..."
1,how the american people get taken in by creative writing,"How many of you can honestly put a title on China? Have you been there? Have you met the people? I am Chinese, and by insulting China, you insult the people of China. It seems that Americans nowadays think that everything but America is bad. Why? Before you start judging other countries, look at what basis you have to place a judgement. This book?Let me tell you something about America. You took the land away from the natives for yourself. Remember the trail of tears? Well that was your ""beloved"" country. You ENSLAVED hundreds of African people, and made us CHINESE people work on your railroad for almost nothing. And you think that you can just base opinions on other countries that you know nothing about when your own country isn't that great?Think about it."
1,Go see for yourself how China has been changing,"This book is one of the garden variety of books that exploit the general ignorance of the American public about China. If you stoke rabid nationalism and xenophobia at a time when the U.S. feels vulnerable, you will have the cash register ringing. I wonder how many of those who have given a postive review of this book have ever been or lived in China--or that part of the world, for that matter. The world is already fraught with strife and violence without this kind of stuff. A responsible intellectual should not publish this kind of material without thinking about the ramifications of his or her actions. Well, that's freedom of speech. What can we say? And we sacrifice a few trees along the way for publishing it....."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This book is based on bill gertz clouded ideas and has nothing of truth. bill gertz is a total bigot, and this book is total garbage. gertz clearly has something against china based on everything that he writes."
1,This is a waste of money,"The book is just a repetition of the Cox report, not much original research here. He really needs to update himself with new information."
1,"Too much guessing, no real value","I suggest readers start from the last chapter, page 199 of the book. All the author's arguments are based on ""... [U.S.]is the leading force for freedom and democracy everywhere. Without this[U.S.] leadership, there is little hope of a better life for all mankind"". If you truly believe this, you may want to read the rest of the book.I don't and I will give you an exmple explaining why: I happen to know a number of Chinese students graduating from MIT. While many were enjoying the excitement with family members during the commencement day, they were alone, quiet, and sad. The U.S. government has disallowed their parents to come for the celebration. Their freedom? Mr. Gertz should explain in his next book."
2,Missing a lot,"This book just left me empty. Never really explained the facts and seemed to be based on too many opinions and biases. How much can a author use ""undisclosed sources"" to explain their subject matter? I'm sure there are more books on this subject worth buying but I wasn't so lucky. I usually keep my books but this one went to the closest garbage can."
2,Needs some Improvement!,"This Is not a bad controller, once you get use to It. Other than that...1. The size Is more for a kid than an adult.2. The steering on this controller Is not very effective at all.3. The suction to hold your controller down Isn't very effective unless you place It on something that will hold It down tightly.For a kid this would be a great beginner controller to use. For an adult, save you money and Invest in something more better!"
2,hard to control,"because its wheel is so small, control become extra sensitive.. bad.. might as well just use your gamepad."
1,junk,My daughter bought this racing wheel for her ps2. You are better off using the ps2 controll pad. It is awful! We returned ours and got our money back. Giving it 1 star is being generous.
1,I give up!,"All that I got out of reading this book is the idea that the author is a smart, successful person. I haven't the slightest clue as to how anything contained in the book can be used in my (or anybody else's) trading. Also, it is much less than an entertaining read. Avoid like the flu - unless you are a masochist, or have trouble sleeping!"
4,Illustrator's gold mine,"I have seen this book only a few times in college. It is truly an inspiring book for the artist. You truly learn about color, design and painting technique. If one ever sees a copy I suggest examining it for a few days straight."
3,Wonderful and Irritating,"Let me first say that I do enjoy this book immensely. However, if you are not a Cornwell fanatic you may find the price a bit steep. I have to agree with the other reviewers in regards to the grayscale plates. I was a huge disappointment to see such a large number of images stripped of their color. It may have been just as economical (since that was most likely the motivation for B&W) and more satisfying to include (if available) more of Cornwell's drawings which are really fantastic. That being said, I still look through the book quite often...maybe because I'm a Cornwell fanatic."
2,"Good, but not really worth it!","I love the content of the book, however, it just looked like a photo copy of the original and you can get the same information in T. L. Johnsons book The FAMILY WORSHIP BOOK that has the same Catechism for Young children and the Shorter Catechism as well and other oodles more wonderful stuff in it.I was disappointed when I recieved this version...."
4,boat sounds good!,"These speakers sound pretty darn good. I can now actually feel the vibration in the seats where they're mounted.The size is a bit larger in the back than the Polk ones I replaced requiring some additional sawing. No big issue.The wire that is included is not worth the space it takes up in the box. Get yourself some good 16 or 18 Ga wire, and make sure the quick disconnects that you have on hand will fit the studs on the speakers! They only include four screws that work fine to mount just the speaker to the wood backing - they are far too short to go through the speaker cover and then to the mounting surface. I ended up using some of my own 1.5"" SS screws to go thru the cover and then speaker to the backing mount."
5,PYLE SPEAKERS,"These speakers are exactly what we needed to put in our boat and get ""boom"".... I will tell everyone who needs new speakers about them.Thank you.PERFECT!!!!"
5,Experience confirms these stories,"I think that this kind of a dialog is so important, especially in the light of recent events.I know that I have similar experiences that validate and echo the writing in this book.It is the first time in my Christian life that the subject of our faith and ethnicity have been addressed by ourselves and not others and I find the stories particularly necessary and moving. By the way I am 49 years old and I say what I say from having lived in two different cultural contexts, both Hawaii and California.In both instances there were challenges to my faith that were particular to the ethnicity I am a part of. But my experience in Hawaii and my experience in California were totally different due to demographic influences...If a book like this had not been written, one would need to have been written.Irma Nicola"
4,a much needed voice for christian asian american women,"i could identify with this book. it is very empowering, encouraging, and uplifting. as a chinese american woman in leadership, the issues of self-doubt, stereotypes, expectations, and the role of women in leadership were addressed, and i was very affirmed through this book in what i know is God's calling."
2,a good product -- with a bad flaw,"Heavy base promising even heat, nice tempered glass lid. It takes care of business.But under normal use the handle on the lid gets too hot to handle. They need to fix this elementary problem before their otherwise excellent product can be considered satisfactory."
2,Not so good,It can't stand on when I turn it left or right. I need to put something in front of it to make it standable.
2,Tells how but not why,"Although this book is filled with details about Vera's identity merger with Nabokov, it never explained WHY she did this. I can see how it would interest Nabokov fans, but can't rate it high as a biography of Vera."
1,Too much,"This was a book club selection and I only made it to page 13. Of the 10+ people in our group, only 2 finished the book. Sentence structure is too long, no real story, just fact after fact. Good if you are a big fan of Nabokov, but if not, skip."
5,Marriage and Nabokov in one brilliant volume,"I admit to having found this book by accident, but from the moment I opened it I was carried away by its intelligence, wit and humanity. It has sent me directly back to the work of Nabokov -- and to Schiff's earlier book."
3,The woman behind Nabokov's success,"A fascinating insight into the post Soviet Russian emigre society as well as into the woman instrumental to Nabokov's success. The book is extremely well researched, although not as beautifully written or tightly scripted as Cleopatra."
1,P.U. MUST BE DRUNK,"SAD, TO SAY THE LEAST.HOWLIN WOLF IS GREAT,BUT THIS VIDEO STINKS.IT IS HARD TO WATCH.GO DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL SKIDROW BAR AND WATCH THE DRUNKS MORE ENTERTAINMENT THERE.........."
3,sleek,"Love this stroller except that it is bulky for myself to use. I'm small Asian mom. we only use it when we stroll around our neighborhood, it's hard for me to wheel around the mall or in the city. We use the McClarance more often than this bumbleride."
2,Inexpensive All-clad pot,"Wow! a 20 qt pot for this low price? Well the disadvantage is that the bottom has that nice thick triple layer of metal, but then it's inferiorly bonded to the sides. There is a lip which looks like it would trap the bits of burnt food etc right where the bottom part meets the sides.If you need a pot this big, keep looking."
3,Leaky.,"A couple months into owning this and it leaks like crazy. The screw-on assembly for the blade and seal is poorly-constructed, jams up, and never seals properly. Reading other reviews, this seems to be a common problem. After spending 20-30 minutes every morning just trying to blend a 1-minute smoothie, I have given up and am now shopping for a replacement.~~Update: I tried ordering a new gasket and blade base for the blender, and when they arrived, they were of a slightly different design than the ones that came with my blender, and they work significantly better. So I am guessing new blenders come with the updated parts, but it still set me back $35 on top of the blender itself."
4,One heck of a great blender.,"I have had this blender for about 4 years know and I can tell you that its' really a great blender. It works well when creating fruit and vegetable blends. My only problem with the blender is when it comes time to remove the base of the blender so you can clean around the rubber gasket. If I can give you one piece of advice, dry the rubber gasket with a paper towel before reconnecting the base. This will keep the base of the blender from leaking. Overall the blender is a great value for the price."
1,Did not last 8 months,"We got this in January and it was used maybe once a week for smoothies. The seal started leaking and we thought we were over tightening based on the instructions. This is just another poorly designed appliance that clearly did not go through any significant testing. At some point consumers need to start holding distributors accountable for selling products like this, especially since this is considered a high-end product."
1,So disappointing...,"I'm so grateful for the previous reviewers analysis of the problem with this blender. He was kind enough to share what he found after opening up the broken part. It was spot on. It's exactly what we found. Our blender lasted about a year. I used it infrequently and then only to make baby food and smoothies. I often had leaking problems and blamed it on my lack of sleep and general incompetence. One day I smelled burning rubber and the smoothie smelled of smoke. I was flabbergasted. How does a such an expensive, heavy duty and beautifully designed piece of equipment break so easily? The bearings do seem to explain what I witnessed. All that green liquid was also getting into the bearings not just leaking all over my counters. Eventually it heated up the rubber too much, thus the smoking and blades froze up. Now to decide if I should by the newest Breville or the Vitamix.... What say you all?"
3,Leaking and breville pretends not to understand,Called Breville today because my blender keeps leaking lateley. 23 min hold time and the lady was telling me I'm not doing something right or I can buy the $50 blade unit and see if that works. I told her it happens so often I'm done blaming myself and I have tried everything to align it properly to no avail.It's a beautiful blender but essentially garbage now and it's just over a year old. The worst part is I have lost my faith and trust in Breville. After seeing all these comments about the leaking I wish I had looked here first so as to save my sanity on the phone talking with someone so almost cruel as to pretend to not know what i am going through.Suggestion: to tighten and loosen the blade with less difficulty you can use your dishwasher drying rack if you have one. Just turn it upside down on the bottom rack and let the rack hold it in place while you place the washer and blade unit and turn in the desired direction.
1,SHOULD BE NEGATIVE 3 STARS!!!!,"ARGHH!!!!!! OMG. this blender is SOOO not worth the headache.Learn from my mistake.I wasted nearly 3 years giving this thing multiple chances.First off, it looks great, but that is where it ends.We got this so-called ""blender"" as a wedding registry gift.The blade assembly started leaking GREASE on the first use.I bought TWO replacement blade assembly for $15 each.Then bought a new pitcher + new blade system for $50 or $60.AND IT STILL FREAKING LEAKS!!!I have probably used this blender for making smoothies like 20-30 times since 2010. I'm not exactly overusing it!!!Breville is officially on my sh!t list. BTW, I posted photos of the leaking blade assembly."
2,"Feels like quality, but its not.","This was a heavy duty awesome blender (while it was working). The motor burned out after about a month...yes 30 days! I used it about 8 times that month to make smoothies (ice, juice, fruit, yogurt) nothing hardcore. Also, my wife could not tighten it enough so it didn't leak, so I always had to put the bottom back on after it was cleaned.For the price of this blender, I can not recommend it to anyone."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,This is the worst blender I have ever used. The vibration from the motor loosens the blade assembly and all of the contents came pouring out of the bottom! I tried several times to tighten and re-attach the blades as best I could but there is a defect in the design process. The motor is great but the body can't accommodate the power it generates. Sad because it is lovely to look at but useless otherwise! Sent back for a refund!!!!!
2,Blades Froze- Killed blender,"was a great product until the blades froze up on us- the motor is cooked as well now. Our unit is 18 mos old. Never had a leak problem or any of the other issues listed here. I did find plenty of replacement parts @ gourmetdepot.com, so I'm going to try and fix it myself. I also found a refurbished unit for $89 @ Sears. That's cheaper than the repair quote Breville gave me....it's an OK blender, but for a car payment ($200), it should last forever. My Waring is 11 years old and still does the job..."
2,Just like all the others,"I, like so many others have bought the cheap blender, only to have to replace it within a year. This one is no different. Yes, it is prettier and quiet, but it took me just as long to make a smoothie and I had to continously stop the blender and stir it around. It had trouble with the frozen strawberries. I am returning it to the store today."
1,not a fan,"I bought this as a step down from the vitamix. I bought it last week I read the reviews and overall they were ok. I was hoping this was an understatement BUT, I was wrong. I make at least two smoothies a day and were have made maybe a handful since we got this. The bottom was on tight and all the sudden the smoothies is flowing, not leaking, out the bottom!! then I hurry and take it off and get it in a cup before I loose it all and there are chucks all over, and our protein powder wasn't mixed in even after mixing it twice. I'm very disappointed. I don't normal leave reviews but this was so bad!!"
1,Great When It Worked,"I purchased this product in October 2008 and can count on my hands the number of times that I have used it. When I did have such an occasion, it ran great--blended and crushed the ice impressively. Then I plugged it in last week and the motor was as dead as a door nail. The lighted buttons worked, but no motor. I contacted Breville Customer Service and was advised the since the warranty had expired, I would have to ship it to the one and only authorized repair facility in Illinois. In addition to the shipping (to and from) costs, I would have to pay a $10 processing fee. If it was the motor, it could cost around $150 (per the people at the repair store)..which would make it the most expensive small appliance I have owned. I have not sent it yet, I will be searching the internet for a replacement, which will not be a Breville."
1,Worst blender ever,This blender is the worst blender I have ever bought. It didn't even last a year before it died and was replaced by Breville. The blade is very difficult to remove. They actually provide a special handle to loosen the blade but not to tighten. To get the rubber ring to line up is a challenge. I would say 4 out of 7 times the rubber ring looks like it is sealing and then I put juice into it to blend and it spills out all over the counter and me. So I started to test the seal with water before I use it. So I have to get out the loosening handle to loosen the blade readjust the ring only to redo the process over and over again. What a nightmare. I just want to blend a simple smoothie without juice spilling all over me and the kitchen. The price is way too expensive for what you get.
1,Blades of Shame,"At a minimum, a good blender should not: 1) insolently leak smoothie all over the counter when your back is turned; 2) vacuum-lock base to bowl, thereby proving impossible for non steroid-using mortals to clean; and, ultimately, 3) short-out, tripping all of the kitchen fuses. When a blender does all three of these things in a six-month span from purchase, there is nothing left to do but warn others to stay far away. Basically, this is the DeLorean of blenders: it looks futuristic, has a dashboard worth of groovy functions, and is, at core, a piece of junk. My previous blender, a decidedly unglamorous $20 Sunbeam, lasted a decade. Sure it only ran on one speed and shaped ice cubes into arrowheads, but at least it worked. Do yourself a favor and put your cash towards an appliance where price is reflective of quality."
3,Just the latest revision of the 600XL,"See the reviews for the BBL600XL. The /A just indicates a slight revision to how the blade assembly is attached to the base. If you try to purchase a 600XL today, you are likely to get the /A version as I did when I purchased mine in Jan 2009. This is a powerful blender that makes short work of ice and other items that give cheaper blenders a rough time. It would probably be rated five stars by anyone with enough wrist strength to tighten the blade assembly to the base properly. You need to remove the blade assembly after every use for thorough cleaning and the torque required may be beyond that of anyone with less than average adult male strength."
3,parts hard to find,"I love this blender, for all the reasons other folks have raved. After about a year, however, the glass jar shattered while I was removing it from the dishwasher. To be clear, this was not rough handling or in anyway way forced; the jar simply stuck for a second on the dishwasher rack and broke into several pieces before I really even knew it was stuck.Fair enough...things happen. Not thrilled, but OK... When I looked up the part on the company website, however, the information said that replacement parts for this product are unavailable. I'm currently searching for a replacement bowl, but am having difficulty finding the right one. Something to bear in mind when purchasing this item..."
2,Dead after about 20 uses.,"Started off great, no leakage like other complaints I've read here, but in the middle of making a Malt the front display lights went out and the Blender was completely dead. Been used about 20 times, mostly margaritas and a couple off malts. It died during what sounded like a free spin... where there is an air pocket in the blender and the blades have essentially no resistance. Accidentally tossed my warranty info, so I'm SOL and can't comment on the Costumer service."
2,Great - for a while but then it WILL fail.,"I've gone through two of these now and it is an amazing blender - but only while a certain part lasts: Specifically, the blade assembly - and it will fail. I promise you. If you are one of the lucky ones, you won't discover black rubber in your food (as I did the first time). How long was I eating rubber? Hopefully not long. The thing looks great, runs well for 6 months to a year, then you will need a replacement blade assembly - which may not sound like a big deal, but try to find one. Back ordered no matter where you look. Stay away from this until Breville fixes a serious problem."
1,Leaky Blender!,"This blender leaked from the day that we got it -- never worked properly, which is so frustrating. It makes a giant mess and half of what you're trying to blend inevitable ends up leaking out. Have contacted Breville for a replacement, although it sounds like this is a problem with all of these and not just mine."
1,love/hate relationship,"i have a love/hate relationship with this appliance. on a good day it is easy to assemble and my morning smoothie preparation runs smoothly with the blender creating a perfect blend of my frozen banana, ice, milk, and supplements. on a bad day, usually if i take the appliance pieces out of the dishwasher and attempt to assemble them while there is any remnant of moisture remaining, i have difficulty assembling the pieces and eventually i have a ""smoothie catastrophe"" flowing through the bottom of the apparatus onto my counter. i would not buy a breville blender in the future unless they redesign this product to eliminate this problem!"
1,Leaks,"Worked brilliantly the first time! I'm sure it would still work brilliantly, except for the fact that it leaks. I've read recently that some people still use it & just clean up afterward. Mine leaks too much for that even. I feel like the O ring just doesnt provide a firm seal between the jug & blades or something.Its so sad as I thought I'd splurge so that this kind of thing wouldn't happen to me. I think I'll stick with the cheapies. I've emailed them to see what I can do. Hopefully they will get back to me soon.Just for reference I'm located in Australia too."
1,LEAKY,"I love the way this blends/crushes frozen fruit/etc. so smoothly and quickly, but hate the cleanup of the leaky mess! So disappointing - will be perfect when they fix this major design flaw."
1,It Leaks - Don't purchase if you intend to use it longer than a year!,"I purchased this blender having read about it and about earlier models that have problems.I purchased the XL model with the expectation that Breville fixed the problem in this revision.Let me tell you that this blender is a dream. Its quiet, it blends up and chops ice seemlessly - that is for the first few months.I found myself trying to tighten and tighten the blender more and more. Finally, I gave up and have returned it.Breville should recall all of these and work thru the leaking problem!"
2,"Excellent design, but very poor reliability","I love using this blender.. except when it breaks. This is the best thing I ever used to blend ice cubes, strawberries, and fruit juice. The intermittent feature is very useful. The first time I bought this, the motor burned out the second time I used it and it was replaced under warranty. With the second one.. now after two years, it started leaking heavily from under the blade seal. The plastic slots under the jar are broken so the motor would only turn on when I had the jar aligned in certain directions (cheap plastic). Finally, the metal blade spun into oblivion and broke apart entirely tonight! Into four pieces! This Breville blender has top notch form and function, but it just falls apart after the warranty expires. Very interesting contrast/irony to see a company with such a well designed product have that same product keep falling apart so miserably."
1,Horrible blender,"Supposedly good reviews caused us to get this blender. But it leaked liquid out the base, and it couldn't blend smoothies to save its life. Threw all the stuff up the sides, had to keep pushing it down. Then I bought a Ninja blender and it rocked!! Half the price, too."
2,leaks forever,"while this blender does nice smoothies, i spent half my time making sure the base was screwed in tight and the other 1/2 of the time, unscrewing it. it even comes with a tool (one more thing to keep track of ) to help get the leverage right to unscrew it. can't do it w/hands alone! also, they tell you a specific way to hold the glass part when screwing in the blade to avoid leaks....too much effort.motor just gave out - i think from too much water getting in the base from cleaning the junk off when it leaked. all in all, good smoothies but a bother..will try other brand next time."
1,Product not reliable,This product dies after 2.5 years. I probably used around 50 times and it is about $4 for each blending.The cleaning for this product is also not very good. The bottom cannot be easily seal even with their tool. Not worthy it. A cheap blender will last longer than this one.
3,works well...when it works,"I have had this blender for a couple of years, and when it was functional it would have been a 4 to 5 star product. Very quick and quiet blending with smoothies and soups that turn out exactly as expected. It was even quite good at making pesto. Clean up wasn't bad, the locking assembly at the bottom allowed it to be disassembled easily, but as with most blenders cleaning around the blade itself took some work.Now for the downside, the bearing assembly on the drive shaft has seized over time causing the blender to blow fuses (if anyone is looking for replacements: [...]. After breaking it down, the bearing does not appear to be sealed as I would have expected for a part that was to be submerged in water. I have contacted Breville and am hoping to get a new blade assembly or drive shaft soon so I can get back to blending."
1,Quality Disapponting,After several weeks the bearing of the knife was rusty and gone and the metal coating of the body exfoliated.Good customer service and fast replacement!Had quality issues with other Breville items as well.
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought the Breville BL600XL Ikon Hemisphere LCD Blender in Decemmber 2007. My wife used it about 10 times. In October 2009, there was no power - it wouldn't turn on. The troubleshooting section of the accompanying guide does not address the problem adequately,and Breville's tlephone/web site is no help. The blender failed for no apparent reason."
1,Piece of junk,"We spent a lot of money on this blender thinking that it would be worth it, but it was NOT. It leaked all the time, the rubber gasket got moldy (no matter how much we washed it), and eventually the leak corroded the outside bottom part of the unit and rusted the bottom part of the blade assembly. Because the unit is out of warranty Breville was no help. I emailed them and they referred me to their customer service number and warned me that it would be quite a long wait on hold. Gee, I wonder why. Don't buy this blender it will self destruct right after the warranty is up. All of the positive review here are no doubt posted by happy Breville employees."
1,Very weak blender,"I was very disappointed with this blender. On its highest setting- there are only 5 of them - it just whirrs a bit. Sounds like a car that might not make it up a hill and you just want to give it a push and hear it kick into gear. But it doesn't. I blended a ripe banana shake and it came out with large chunks of banana. I got it for Christmas so I think I'm pass the return period, otherwise I would. Also, the glass pitcher is very heavy and not so easy to clean."
1,Pain to just replace a fuse!!! Will need to throw it out!,Worked great until a fuse blew. Now impossible to get the base off this thing to do a simple repair. I'm in NJ and nearest service is NY and shipping ain't worth it.Also 0 service person would not even have the courtesy of helping by giving advice on getting base off to check if just a fuse before shipping it!!Hammer and chisel coming out and if I screw it up I'm getting a customer friendly blender!!!!
1,Great Product while it lasted,"Received this a wedding gift. It performed great while it lasted until the cheap mechanism that transfers the motor power to the blades broke. Contact Breville for support, very difficult to get through. Since it was out of warranty it was going to cost $75 for this part. Instead of spending that I decided just to buy a cheap store bought blender, which has performed very well for over a year. When it breaks I will just replace. For any appliance that is going to cost $$$ consider the warranty from the manufacturer and the reputation of the company. A one warranty is not enough when spending this much on a blender."
2,This is a leaky one folks,"I thought this blender would solve all the issues I've had with previous blenders; dying for no apparent reason, difficult to clean, gears becoming stripped, etc. It's a nice looking blender and very quiet. However, no matter how much I try to secure the blade component to the base of the jar, it ALWAYS leaks from underneath. Sometimes when I pour my juice or milk into the jar, it literally comes pouring out from the bottom and all over the countertop. I have to quickly pour the liquid into another container and attempt to tighten the blade some more. This leakage makes cleanup a hassle because I have clean the base and under the gears every time. Additionally, I have to pour my smoothies into a glass over the sink. I'm going to be returning this product and looking at a Vitamix."
4,Satisfied client,The blender is excellent. My family is using it every day to make healthy smoothies.
1,Would not recommend,"This seemed like a good blender as it is very quiet and does a great job. However, there is a huge design flaw with the base that requires a lot of torque to remove and replace. Even after tightening it down with the special tool it often leaked until I ""really"" tightened it. My wife struggled and complained constantly with this aspect and even chipped the pitcher while trying to remove the base.Then after about 14 months, the motor quit and it only has a flashing red light when powered on. We emailed Breville and they responded that the unit was out of warranty and it needed to be sent to one of their repair shops at my cost. Sorry, but I expect more from a $200 blender and will not be purchasing any Breville products moving forward."
1,Could Have Been a Great Blender,In July 2007 I bought a Breville BBL600XL blender after it had been recommended by Popular Mechanics magazine. For about a year I was very satisfied with the unit. But it eventually started giving me the exact same trouble as described in R.B. Jones' review. It leaked and the bearing siezed up just as described. I bought a new jar unit and after several months it did the same thing. I liked the blender when it was new and working but I will never buy another Breville product. This blender is obviously ill designed with poor quality parts. It should be recalled by the manufacturer with a full refund.
1,Waste of money!,"I bought the Breville Ikon blender two years ago to replace my old one that I've had for almost eight years. At first, I was so excited to get the new blender. It looks stylish, sturdy, and easy to clean. To make long story short, in the last two years since I bought it, I've got a new glass jug, replaced each the rubber seal/ring and the bottom piece (the blade) twice...all for the same two reasons: leak and stinky smell. I miss my old blender!!!"
3,"DOESN'T LEAK BUT LEAVES LARGE CHUNKS OF BANANA, MANGO, ETC","AFTER TWO NEW KITCHENAIDE 560 BLENDERS THAT LEAKED ON THE FIRST TRY, THIS ONE HAS NOT LEAKED IN MY FIRST FOUR USES. SO FAR ITS A WINNER. SMOOTHIES ARE SMOOTH, AND ON SOME SETTINGS IT IS EXTREMELY QUIET. LOOKS GREAT AND HEAVY METAL BASE HOLDS IT SOLID ON THE COUNTER. LIT BUTTONS ARE A GOOD IDEA SO I KNOW WHAT BUTTONS I PUSHED. MINE IS THE 600 WATT MODEL IF THAT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AFTER A MONTH OF DAILY USE - IT IS LEAVING LARGE CHUNKS OF MANGO, BANANA, ETC, EVEN AFTER USING THE HIGHEST SETTING. PROBABLY TAKING IT BACK. CAN'T SOMEONE MAKE A GOOD BLENDER??"
3,I Loved it Until...,"My husband and I received a Breville as a wedding gift in 2007. I loved it! It easily blended smoothies, sorbet, soup, and so much more. I used it a few times a month, but not on a regular or daily basis. A few days ago, it randomly burned out. The entire kitchen smelled like burnt rubber for 2 days. Having owned several cheap blenders in the past, I was used to them breaking on me but this blender was purchased for $250!! I am now wary of buying an expensive quality blender, because I don't think I could bear it breaking! For the almost 5 years it lasted, it was the best blender I ever used but I think I will go for a cheaper brand this time around."
2,Finishing surface coming off from base!!,"Bought it for the look and quiet operation. But, after a few months of 1-minute daily use, the finishing surface from the metal base started peeling off. It is unacceptable for such an expensive blender. However, for operation- and function-wise, it is an excellent product. So, two stars."
1,Power button did not shut off on 2nd use,"I'll give this blender a higher rating when the company provides me with a replacement. It's a sleek, sexy machine that is fast and it worked beautifully, but on the second use the power button would not shut off the power supply.I am in the process of sending it back with a shipping label that the company provided over the net, but not having saved the packaging, this is going to be a hassle for me, as I hate schlepping, including hang-time on the phone and getting no sympathy from a rep when they finally called back.For $200.00 for a blender I would have expected better results, and I'll be bleeped as to why a button would be inoperable to shut down the power supply. Lastly, I would not recommend this blender to anyone with weak forearms or wrists as with its wide diameter and heavy glass, it takes two hands for an older person, especially with a full volume of soothies in it."
1,breville poor customer service,This has been an ok machine but when the seal broke apart it was impossible to get a replacementhours on the phone to breville where no one picked up and there order on line service did not operate correctlysuch poor service i would never buy another product from this company
5,I'm One Very Satisfied Customer,"This blender is definitely worth the price. It's a beautiful appliance and built sturdy. I agree with the other positive reviews I've found for the Breville blender. The ice crusher does a fantastic job with making the perfect frozen margarita. The cap fits securely enough you don't have to hold it down during heavy jobs and the blender stays in its place during the process. However, because the cap is so secure, it a little tricky removing. That's my only gripe if you even consider it a gripe. I'm one very satisfied customer."
2,The finish is falling off!,"To be fair, the blender blends and does it well. My problem is with the finish. The base isn't stainless steel, it's a stainless steel finish that has been slowly disintegrating over the past year. The other day a big chunk fell off and that's when I decided to write this review. It's gone from a beautiful piece of machinery to a piece of junk. I've noticed that other people are having this problem, so I know I'm not the only one."
3,Powerful...but,"We have owned this blender for about two years. It is still powerful. It does an excellent job. However, the measurements have come off the glass. They are not embossed into the glass. In addition, the chrome finish is coming off the base. This should not happen with a product this expensive."
2,Nice blender until...,"This is a great blender that I enjoyed very much for the first six months until some liquid got into the NON-REMOVABLE rubber seal on the inside of the container and started to smell...Unappealing.That said, it was a great blender while it lasted. Buying aVita-Mix 1363 CIA Professional Countertop Blender with 2+ HP Motor, Platinumor aKitchenAid KPCB348PNP Pro Line Chef's Blender with Polycarbonate Jar, Nickel Pearlnext.Pretty disappointed with this thing given the hefty price tag."
1,Never made it three months,"I love the look and the shutoff timer. However, after just a few short months of use, it crapped out on me. I don't have the original receipts or box, so I can't return it. Big waste of money!"
1,"Pretty OUTSIDE, but Ugly INSIDE!","I just got off the Breville USA site and....1. It appears that I can't get a new glass jar to save my life!2. Also, have you ever solved the leak issue with this blender?3. Because of the constant leakage, I'm forced to clean the top of the motor often. Because of this, the finish is coming off in three quarter sized places.Is this scripture describing your blender? Looks pretty outside, but inside it's full of disturbing issues and poor engineering?Matt 23:27 ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.(NKJV)"
4,second time's the charm,"When I got the blender, it worked for 3 days, and then would only stay on for 3 seconds before stopping (except on ice crush.) I called Breville. They said they would send me a replacement citing mechanical failure. After I dropped it off at Fed X, it took about 4 weeks for the replacement to come. So far, it works great. The smoothie function rocks!"
4,Breville BBL600XL,"Overall this is a good product.However, there are several irritating things in this and all the Breville products.First their packaging sucks. Lots of plastic and foam to get rid of. Note to Breville management: Go buy a Dyson vacuum and see how a first-rate company packages things. Go back and kick your package engineers into designing the kinds of things they already want to do.Second, lose the cheesy plastic pieces. I love the beefy base and the solid glass container, so why top it with a 10 cent part that looks cheap and is probably going to be the first thing to break?In operating, the machine is fantastic. Feels solid and capable. I raise my smoothie to you!"
4,brothers and keepers: A memoir or therapy session,"wideman tells an excellent tale about how two siblings of the same environment can go on to lead totally different lives. One brother is a world reknowned novelist and professor. The other brother is a convict serving a life sentence for murder. Wideman explains and analyzes how culture, including racism, classism,and self-identication, influences a person's lifestyle. At times the memoir seems reminscent and nostalgic. Other times, wideman tends to get lost in his own thoughts while writng, which makes the work appear as therapeutic writing not intended for others to read. The issues he raises in the book such as racism, self-identification, and guilt, helps us as readers to recall our own issues with these subjects and how we can work through them."
1,don't bother,This book is not worth reading. I have sympathy for the author. I did not finish it because it is soooooooo boring.
5,Great book,"An amazing story of a brother, who after loosing contact with his younger sibling, finds himself very distant and on totally different realities."
4,Autographed copy!,"Hello,He was a part of a writers series at my college, and I got an autographed copy. How much is an AUTOGRAPHED COPY of John Edgar Wideman's ""Brothers and Keepers"" going for?"
1,"Clunky, cumbersome, buggy software cripple it","I received one of these as a gift recently. My first thought was ""this is exactly what I need."" I often have to scramble from one city to another, often at the last minute and it's easy to miss important meetings.If the software worked with Meeting Maker, I'd be happy, but it doesn't and for some reason when I convert from Meeting Maker to Outlook, the software hangs during the Outlook import. So basically, the thing is useless for me. Starfish and Xircom apparently have no interest in helping me out. Too bad, because it's really a great idea, a small, inexpensive, essentially disposable gizmo with a lot of memory."
3,Requires $ software to sync w/Outlook,"I have a Palm V that syncronizes with MS Outlook, so I figured that for 29 dollars I could buy the Rex, and sync it with all the info from Outlook. This way, I could choose to carry a tiny, stripped down PDA with the same data as in my Palm V.Turns out that the sofware required to sync with outlook costs 40 dollars, and is not included. Without this extra purchase- you are stuck using the REX desktop software.Other than that, 29 dollars is well below cost, especially with the included docking station, and the Rex has a clear screen (but no backlight) and it is easy to navigate through its basic funtions."
3,Okay but,"This is a very handy organizer. However, an alternative should have been provided so that data can be entered directly to the REX without the need for a PC."
4,Very useful because it's small enough to take everywhere,I had been using an Apple Newton for a few years and wanted to upgrade to another personal organizer. The Rex is nice because it's incredibly small size makes it so easy to take with you. I keep in with me almost whereever I go and it's a great comfort to know that I have contact information with me everywhere. The memo storage feature is also nice: I use it to store various tidbits of information and it has replaced stacks of Post-It(tm) Notes all over my desk. I have a Toshiba Libretto that I mainly use to program the Rex. I also bought the docking station but it doesn't get much use because my main computer is short of serial ports. Two drawbacks: There is no input capability whatsoever; it must be programmed from software on a PC. The proprietary software that comes with it is the only way to program it without spending more money. At this price it would even be a worthy companion to a PalmPilot.
5,Todd is Godd,"I too do not actually own this album anymore. I used to have it on cassette. It really is a great album and it is inexplicable to me why allmusic.com, which normally gets most things right, is so down on it. I wish someone would make this available again for an acceptable price."
5,Best of its kind,"I learned of Kapralov's book by reading a book on the downtown scene called Down and In. Kapralov is a natural, and his prose is far more engaging than the self-consciously 'literary' types writing about similar situations. I highly recommend this book.Addendum -- April 2005 -- Kapralov just died of alcoholism. Rest in peace, my friend. You did well."
1,Don't buy!!,My regular phone has better sound quality then TC930 900MHz phone. May times answering machine does not record messages. Finally I had to replace it.
3,Careful...Remix Warning!,"It's a shame that nobody seems honest anymore about advertising remixes. If you're looking for your favorite 90s dance songs in their original radio releases, this is NOT the CD for you. Only two marginally popular songs in this compilation seem to be of the same length and unmolested. The remixes are not even that good and frankly ruin the songs. I'm disappointed because the ""20th Century Masters - The Millenium Collection"" series always seems to give you the original hits or modest edits."
4,Thank goodness they are not the 3 minute radio mixes,"After reading Carlos D. Tres' review, I just had to write one. Rarely do you find a reviewer who is upset at getting full dance mixes instead of the edited radio mixes. Generally the complaints are the other way around. So, if you want the edited versions played on the radio, avoid this CD. If you want the extended versions heard in dance clubs, this is a fine cd.For those who like radio edits of dance songs, I recommend that you buy anything from the Ultimate Dance Party andDance Party: Like It's ... series. Both series generally have 2 to 3 minute radio edits which allows them to squeeze about 19 or so tracks onto a CD."
3,Not as good as Walking with Dinos,"If you already own Walking with Dinosaurs and want something more, this is a good 'prequel', otherwise buy Dinos first. Fun for families/kids/adults interested in natural history, dinos, etc. The series is a little more 'broken' than the Dino series, though special effects have come farther."
5,Very entertaining,"I bought this for a child who really enjoys it. Its entertaining for the whole family. Jennifer Smith Miguel, [...]"
3,Inaccurate,"This movie isn't as great as Walking with Dinosaurs and Beasts. It has few facts and consists almost entirely of speculation, and cites it as fact. It also uses inaccurate terms, and some parts are inaccurate. It also lacks a lot of famous animals, and most importantly, it's too short. I expected something longer. I was very disapointed to not see famous animals in a documentary about life before the dinosaurs. Overal, three stars."
3,Not as good as the others in the series,"Positives:The graphics were well done and the animals looked realistic.Key anatomical distinctions and developments are highlighted with each new animal.Negatives:The size of some of the animals (i.e., giant sea scorpions, dragon flies, and spiders) don't seem large on screen. Others looked more their correct size, but these did not.The show is rushed and would have been better with each animal getting more time.There seems to be more supposition and speculation put forward in this show than in the others of the series.It was kind of preachy in that just about every 10 minutes a new critter is described as our ancestor. It would be nice if they'd make a good show about these animals without hammering the point that either: A) we evolved from such-and-such animals or B) that evolution is a scientifically baseless fraud. I'd prefer a show just about the animals, which is all the kid's interested in."
2,received Video - CMOS Battery a mess,"Received the Walking with Monsters video it worked fine and it was a good movie. I am still rather ticked off that you didn't have the Dell Latitude CMOS batteries that were supposedly in stock according to your system. I am also still waiting for another video to arrive and it has been over a month. And, the CMOS battery order was cancelled, so now I have to research a new purchase source."
4,Before the Dinosaurs....,Excellant and educational film for the tween set. My daughter watched it in her science class and since she is an avid dinosaur fan she wanted a copy of it for home.
4,great...but could have been much better,"this special was amazing. i am really 16, and have always been a fan of creatures from before dinosaur supremacy. however, i think 90 minutes is far too short for such a huge amount of life. most of the time periods up until the early Permian were skimmed over, and the Ordovician period was completely passed over, without a word said.also, there were many creatures that i was disapointed not to see get re-created in this special. a few apperences, such as Gorgonops, Dimetrodon, Edaphosaurus, Euparkeria, Pterygotus, etc, i was happy to see. however, i was dissapointed when i did not see Icthyostega, Estemmenosuchus, Protorosaurus(earliest known archosaur), and many more creatures that i would like to know more about.it is good, for 90 minutes, but if the creators were to re-create it as a four hour special, it could become something truly spectacular."
3,put out the fire,The songs are to repetive and sound lousey. I would like it for a collection and would like it as a gift but not buy it for my self or for a gift.
5,A PERFECT PIE PLATE!,"This All-Clad Gold Standard Pie Plate deserves five shiny gold stars for performance. Due to it's patented reinforced system for nonstick cooking crusts are a beautiful, even golden brown.The plate's appearance is contemporary and classic so that it can be served from the table if one chooses. And, of course, it is dishwasher safe. I might add that it comes from our dishwasher sparkling and bright, as if it were new.It's my understanding that All-Clad was designed in the beginning for use by professional chefs. Well, I'm far from a topnotch chef but I certainly use All-Clad and love it!"
1,common sense,This seems to be a common sense approach that really doesn't require much intelligence or thought... much less reading a book.
4,Refreshing Simplicity,"This book really makes you stop and think about how you're spending the precious commodities of your life, time and money. Practical suggestions that you can begin to apply immediately to begin simplifying your life. A must read."
4,Fast Service!!!!!,The service was fast great and The price was just right!!!! I will definitely keep them in mind for future purchases!!!!
5,Great book for little ones!,"My daughter is 18 months older than my son and at this point (20 months), still not completely verbal.The pictures in the book ,(which is beautifully illustrated) like the basinette, the changing pad, the baby bath and so forth really hit home with her. She spent a lot more time with this book than she has with books on other topics, and pointed to the relevant pictures. I think it helped her to see pictures of what she was experiencing.What I also liked was that it gives a very positive message about the new baby and the child in the book, who is the middle sibling. Highly recommended."
4,New Ideas on an Old Favorite,"Akhenaten has long been a favorite of Egyptologists...and like many of the other reviewers I've followed the available published material over the years. Unlike some other works, this book is shorter and more readily accessible, especially for those without their MA in history. That said...if this topic interests you, please seek out more information. Other reviews have fabulous suggestions.Great illustrations, succinct text, and a new theory on the identity of ""Smenkhare"" make this book well worth reading."
2,The author has issues,"Kudos to the people who were able to muddle through this. As far as I can tell the author is, at best, a literate misogynist. His summary of Hatshepsut's reign is offensive and completely contrary to scholarly understanding. According to him, Hatshepsut was but a greedy power monger under whose reign Egypt's imperial greatness was severely impared. No positive reference is made with regard to Hatshepsut and no reference to her is replete without an insult or an aspersion. I have little faith that I will gain any insight on Akhenaten from this book. If I could return this book, I would."
2,disappointing DVD quality,"The copy I bought (new,sealed) is a poor quality black and white film.Not only the documentary (which is a real masterwork by Erica Anderson and portrays one of the greatest men who ever lived) has not been restored at all, but the original footage has also been very heavily cut: and this is the most disappointing thing of all. I remember watching the real thing, and there was a sequence featuring Schweitzer sitting on the Kanzerein and contemplating the valley below, the wind playing with his white hair: a very moving scene indeed, but there's no trace of it on this DVD.I hope some other reliable firm will some day publish the whole of the film, in color and really restored."
3,Is this the original 1957 film?,"This DVD advertises itself as the ""Academy Award Winner Best Documentary 1957,"" ""first time on DVD,"" ""restored and uncut."" But I question these assertions. According to the 1957 New York Times review, the film was in color, yet this DVD is black-and-white. The DVD version also contains many imperfections, so I doubt that it's ""restored."" Therefore,I must wonder if this DVD even contains the full original film. Nevertheless, even this version of the film is still worth seeing just to witness the great humanitarian Albert Schweitzer working in his hospital and playing the organ."
1,Felt very unsecure in using this product,"This product seems to be quality made, but with the large TV on top of the pedistal, the turntable part of the unit seemed very wobbly and unstable. I have a small child in my home. I never really used it due to my fear that it made my TV unsafe for my child to be around. I used the old motto: Better to be safe than sorry. I eventually gave it away to someone without children."
1,I'd Rather Read The Back of Cereal Boxes,"What a terrible book. The only part I enjoyed is the rejection letter from Jimmy. As one person had mentioned in another review, you need a notepad to follow the timelines and half-a**ed assumptions in this work. Please save your money, and support Jimmy in his rejection of this work."
1,Cheap Imitation,"Eng has a lot of facts about the life of Jimmy Buffett but that's about all. Those of us who have been fans of his since the very beginning already knew most of them. Too much rambling speculation about Jimmy's possible ancestors. Eng does not have near the writing talent that Jimmy does so he should not have done this bio. His motivation seems to be celebrity and riches. If you want to read a really good book about the life of Jimmy Buffet up to age 50, ""A Pirate Looks at Fifty"" is the best book I have read in many years. But what would else would we expect from a master storyteller?"
1,Can't Believe I Hate a Buffett Book,"This book is downright awful. Let me warn you - stay away. I agree with the other reviews. There are detailed facts about things totally unrelated to Jimmy Buffett or even the point that the author is trying to make. I guess if you took out all of the irrelevant lines, the book would be only 20 pages of nothing new.*You have been warned*"
