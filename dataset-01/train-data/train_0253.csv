3,it was ok,This book is about a teenager named Daniel but most people called him Danny. Danny saw an old lady getting robbed and so Danny goes and beats up the guy who robbed the lady. Little does he know that the guy he beat up is the brother of one of the most toughest gangs in school.He goes to Alcatraz Island to escape but he ends up trapped there with the outlaws.I liked it because it has a lot of action.
3,This book is about a boy who hides on Alcatraz Island,"In my opinion, this is one of Eve Bunting's best books, although i have never read any of her books. At first it started out as a boring suspense story but, it turned into a eye opening story. The story was about a boy named Danny. Who ran into a gang and is hiding in Alcatraz Island to escape from being killed."
4,A page turner.,"Non-stop suspense from the first to the last page. Alcatraz must be a spooky place in the daylight, but at night with a gang after you it would be even scarier."
4,Good start,"As a Management Consultant with an IT company, I have always been compelled by ideas to improve communications between the ""top"" consultants and the actual analysts and programmers. This is a very hard exercice indeed as everybody seems to speak his own language.UML can certainly improve on this and more, but beware, it is not a panacea as it is only a way to express situations. There are still a bunch of loopholes like uniform B-IT patterns that have to be developed (in-house).So, yes indeed, this book gives you more than a few kicks in the butt, but we still have to walk a long walk."
3,why buy a new one?,I guess the student comments in the last edition were so good the editors decided to use them again!
1,Incredibly inaccurate,"Beginning in the 8th grade, I became addicted to this book. The amount of information it, the unique ratings and rankings systems, the quotes from students...it was great. In total, I've bought 5 editions.Then came the time when I actually went to college and experienced it for myself. I'm a junior now. Last year, our campus newspaper printed an article that shocked me. It contained excerpts from the latest edition's description of our school. It was blatantly wrong. It made this place out to be a hellhole. Why? Because they based their review on the results of less than 10 informal surveys.I saw the new edition last week, and again, its description of my school is filled with inaccuracies. If you want a great college guide, get Barrons Top 50: An Inside Look at America's Best Colleges, which is not sold on Amazon.It's great bathroom reading but don't rely on it for its descriptions of life on campus."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I had high hopes for this commentary, but was very disappointed. The author uses the KJV text instead of a modern, more accurate version, and the research is very shallow. There is nothing original here I found. Only a rearranging of old material into a new package. Buy Witherington, Bock, or Polhill. Don't waste your money on this"
5,Buyer beware regarding quality of discs,"The music,of course,is wonderfulBut, please pay heed to the remarks ofother reviewers regarding glue residueon a couple of the discs in this set.I have purchased this set twice via usedre-sellers on amazon. It is a credit to them that eachprovided a full refund upon return.I just wish I could get my hands on a cleanversion of this set."
5,well worth buying!!!!,There are many books in this series and this was one I didn't have and decided to buy it and add it to my collection. All my children enjoyed it and it will be read over and over again.
3,Not as good as the Blair Witch Project,When I first started watching this movie I got bored. Did that three times. It wasn't until my fourth try that I made it all the way through the movie. Once I got past the beginning it turned out to be a respectable movie. I thought the acting was kind of bad in the beginning. I have to admit that it had a cool ending in my opinion.
4,"Fans of Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, X Files should love this","This movie had good performances along with a believable story line that could have been ripped from today's headlines and kept me interested from start to finish. And I loved the twist ending, it was straight out of the Twilight Zone!"
2,Too many plot holes,"This movie will leave you with unanswered questions. I would like to know how the woman the died came back to life. I would like to know if she re-died later in the film, and if so how? I would like to know how no one seemed to know the cult existed. Someone had to...how did they get members? At the end...there seems to have been a family change...was it leagal? How did that happen? I COULD GO ON>>>It's cool for a rental or a cheap purchase...but it will leave you empty. And it's not as scary as people say. And you can see the Heaven's gate influence...to even some of the images of the leader are similar to Applewhite."
1,Save your Cash!,"A VERY Strange & Predictable Film, that even a strong cast could not save. Instead of buying this go out and buy ""Murder One"" where you can see Daniel Benzali really strut his stuff in a believeable way."
4,Great into to ASP.NET,"If you are an ASP veteran and want to get quickly up to speed with ASP.NET, this is your book. The differences between the two are highlighted often and you'll be up and running with ASP.NET in no time. If you're looking for an ASP.NET reference, you'll be disappointed. This book is not a reference work. For that see the VS.NET help or get another book to compliment this one."
3,"Clever, yet an altogether mediocre story.","This novel tells of the many turns of Anne Garland's heart takes as she decides upon one of three possible suitors. Each turn her heart takes affects the other suitors in ways which are humorous/clever, but the underlying theme is the pathos you feel for the unfavored ones, primarily John Loveday and his ultimate resolution. Overall not bad."
5,Go on - read it,"Now I know this is not one of better known Thomas Hardy Books. And I know it probably isn't all that well thought of by critics who like the doom of many of his other books (that doesn't sound good, but if you get the chance read them anyway!) I like this because it is nice and simple, about a gil called Anne, who is in love with someone called Robert, who is continously unfaithful to her. And of course you have John, Robert's brother, who is in love with Anne. You sympathise so much with the characters. And, in this book, there is a happy/sad ending, but I would spoil it if I said any more. Without reading this, you might feel that Anne is a bit stupid to stand by her man, but just go and read it and you'll understand better. Perhaps this book isn't a great literary masterpiece like other works, but it is fairly easy to read, which is exactly what I advise you to do!"
3,"3.5 Stars for Hardy, 4 For General","Warning, it's a sad ending. Return of the Native, which I was read to believe a sad ending, wasn't really as much so as departing this book, though not nearly as much so as Tess of the d'Urbervilles, (brilliant book BTW). I cannot say more, other than most of the characters, (especially Anne,) lived happily ever after. However, if you're looking for non-depressing Hardy books, this probably won't be your cup of tea.As for the story, a small part seemed a little underdeveloped -- the story between Festus and the actress girl, (who's name escapes me at the moment,) towards the ending of the book. For a Hardy book it's off and on; slow build, intricate and multi-layered in the middle, slightly abrupt ending. For modern books, this is Hardy! none really come close IMO, and in this is the same style he owns that takes you out of this world and puts you right into the book. 6.7/10."
3,Sunbean heated mattress pad,"It works, but the L temp is far too high. I like the fact there is only one place to have to plug a dual control in, however, the controller on the left side will NOT lie flat, and the flat wire was so twisted that after this time, I still cannot get it straightened enough to keep the controller on the nightstand."
2,Broke After a Few Months,"Worked well for a few months then my precious bed warming mattress cover started breaking down. I really love the warmth when it works, but unfortunately due to poor quality, I had to throw it out."
5,Dad Said It Was Yummy,"I bought this for my 83 year old father who chooses to live on oatmeal, peanut butter and crackers, coffee, chocolate and ensure. He was happy."
3,"if i have a cheese craving, i think i'll just eat an avocado","recently turning vegan, i decided i would like to have a cookbook of uncheese recipes. though there are some on the market that are more known and reviewed than this one, i decided to try it. so far i have tried two recipes and each were disappointing. maybe i have my expectations set too high? really, for recipes that boast a ""velvety"" cheese sauce and soy -less ""cream"" cheese, these are a downer. perhaps if they instead had names like ""orangy sauce that is incredibly inventive but doesn't really taste like cheese sauce"" or ""white spread for toast"" i wouldn't have been so disappointed. so, from now on i will try to stick to whole foods (like avocados)to get my fix instead of the recipes in this book."
4,no milk recipes,"Overall the book is good and there are a number of recipes that look delicious. But it was a bit of a shock to find out the they didn't include a non-dairy milk recipe - no soy milk, almond milk or any milks that can be made at home. Any recipe that uses non-dairy milk requires you to buy it prepackaged. Very odd not to include the basics. Very disappointing."
4,Pretty good,"Bought the book for a friend who is lactose intolerant. After a lot of research, it really stood out as the best book. Unlike many books, it's entirely dairy free, which is key to those who are fully lactose intolerant. And I wasn't specifically interested in a book that was vegan (or soy free).He likes the book quite well, and I think/hope it'll prove useful to him. It's hard to buy something like this who has been intolerant for a while, and already knows many of the specifics the book covers, but I think/hope it'll prove useful."
2,"This is for vegans, not just the lactose intolerant","I bought this book so that I could learn some milk-free recipes, as I have trouble digesting dairy products. I was dismayed to find that this book is hardcore vegan...so not only is there no milk, there's no eggs or anything else from an animal. I mean, if you want to be vegan, fine, but I'm just looking for some milk and butter-free recipes. These recipes called for way too much tofu, though I'll admit the tofu cupcakes were good. But by and large, unless you are really committed to the vegan lifestyle, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Falls Apart Easily,"My youngest son is an avid Bob the Builder fan and that was the gift theme for him last Christmas. We bought this and the chainsaw set and they were both a waste of money. This particular set falls apart easily and folding it up to put away is near impossible. Nothing aligns properly and the spare pieces fall out the entire time your trying to wrestle it shut.The die cast vehicles are too heavy to use with this toy and after attemping to play with it a few times, our kids gave up. The track snaps togther well, but that it the only part of this product that was useable."
1,Not worth my money,"I wish there were reviews on this toy two month ago. My son and his friends love this toys, but it is too easily break apart. It is cheaply made, and definetily waste of my money."
1,piece of junk,"I just had to add my review!....I want to make sure people know this toy is a piece of junk. Nothing about this stays together! I'm annoyed with putting it all back together. It will soon go to never never toyland. This is probably one of the worst toys my kids have ever gotten. My daughter is 4 and she can't even get the toy to stay together. It's just ridiculous! Meanwhile, my poor 2yr old son just cries because he wants lofty to go over the bridge but the bridge won't even stay up!....gggggrrrr Oh and finally i put one star only because zero was not an option."
1,Don't waste your money,"I agree with the complaints already written about the toy falling apart easily. Also, the sounds are really annoying and they get set off very easily. I was just about to make the batteries ""die"" when three of the screws became loose and we had to take the toy away until we could fix it. We looked everywhere for a screwdriver w/ a triangle shape to tighten them back into place, but haven't been able to find one. Although my son has been asking frequently if the toolbox is fixed, he really has been having as much fun just using the diecast vehicles by themselves."
1,I agree,"This product is awful, it won't stay together and is very frustrating to both myself and my three year old. What a disappointment."
1,Can we fix it? No we can't!,My son recieved this for his 3rd birthday. We couldn't get it to stay together the first time we used it. When you finally get it all closed up to carry and put away it falls apart again. We are so disappointed with this. Don't the manufacture's try these things first?
3,Can Mom Fix It?,"This Bob the Builder toy might be fun for the kids to play with, but it's a hassle for Mom to put back together all the time! Every time my sons play with it, panels pop off, the bridge comes apart, etc. I end up putting it back together several times, just so play can continue. The concept is good, and I like that it all folds up for storage. This product could stand some improvement, though!"
1,Can we fix it? !!! Not a chance.,"Even Bob's many building talents could not deal with this problem. We could not be more disappointed. Like the previous reviews say, it falls apart constantly. You cannot play with one area without having your child ask you to fix some other part that has just collapsed or doesn't fit properly. This was a waste of money. I expected better given that the actual character vehicles are a lot hardier and can withstand alot more play."
1,Learning Curve should be ashamed...,"This toy has inspired me to write my first review. If I could have rated this a ""0"" I would have done so. It's absolutely horrible. Learning Curve should be ashamed of the extrememly poor workmanship on this toy. What makes it all the more frustrating is that my grandson loves the concept and wants to play with the toy - but even at 5 years of age he is unable to manage all of the problems. For goodness sakes, Bob himself couldn't handle this project! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Also, as noted in an earlier review - the chainsaw deal has all the same problems so don't buy it either. Very disappointing."
2,Bob the Builder Electronic Toolbox,"Plastic toolbox, falls apart real easily, can't even pick it up in one piece.Son still likes to play with it though."
2,Beware,"This is an Ok album in Incognito discography though not their best. Why do I rate it at 2-stars if it is an Ok music? Because I tend to beleive that we should not only listen to music but also try to understand it. Poor sound engineering can hardly allow to enjoy the spectrum of small bits of sound that add greatly to overall impression and invlovment. And the sound quality of this CD is awfull not to say more. It is flat, with no details and lacking life. It is not first time I noticed that Incognito releases are not mastered very well while their great music is all about soul and detail.So, good music, bad sound..."
4,Shannon Unbound...,"Shannon Tweed (Of Unknown Origin) plays Sharon, an actress visiting her sister's art gallery. It's a pleasant visit up until the group of homicidal criminals shows up! Sharon finds herself up against terrorists, led by the loathesome Mr. Dengler (Lance Henriksen from Aliens, Pumpkinhead, Near Dark, etc.). Sharon must shift from über-hot celebrity into über-hot commando mode in order to deal w/ Dengler and his ruthless cohorts, and rescue her sister and her friends. Both Tweed and Henriksen are perfect in their roles, actually raising the material above the usual DIE HARD-clone, action rubbish. Yes, there's gunfire, explosions, and karate, but it's well handled, and the plot is fairly engaging. The finalé, when Dengler gets what's coming to him, is a horrifically gooshy classic!..."
5,Got book in great shape and fast.,The book is in great condition and it got to me the fastest of all the books I ordered at the same time.
5,Informative and funny,"I'm writing this in response to a couple of other reviewers who didn't like the author's writing style. I'm currently using this book for a class, and I'm thrilled to actually be enjoying a textbook for a change. I find the comments hilarious. In addition, the book offers good, practical advice, with very little useless background information. I'm finding this book a totally refreshing change from what I've been subjected to in education textbooks so far."
3,A preview of reconstruction,"Willie Lee Rose describes what took place in the Sea Islands of South Carolina during the Civil War. When Union troops took over the Islands in 1861 the plantation owners fled. They left behind their negroe slaves.Administration of the area was divided between the military, various missionary associations and cotton agents. The negroes continued with their agricultural duties, but no longer as slaves.Under the new system, cotton productivity declined. One major factor was because the negroes preferred to grow food crops rather than cotton. They could not eat cotton.When the Civil War ended in 1865, some of the old planters returned, but in many instances their land had been forfeit.From a non-academic layman's viewpoint, even though there is worthwhile information to be learned from this book, it was very hard for me to finish it. The basic ideas could have been presented in a much shorter monograph."
5,Penguin Movie,Great for my 2nd graders who were learning about penguins. I used it as a final fun time for the penguin unit that we did in the winter.
4,wealth of information,"Very complete and scholarly book on fishing. Although quite a bit of the book dealt with conventional fishing, his discussion of how to rate lakes by clarity and hardness of water was valuable. His information on stream dynamics and fly fishing was what I was really interested in, and although he recommends flies that would be incredibly huge today for most streams, his techniques were right on. I always learn a few things from these older books, (this one first written in 1955) and this book provided more than a few. The fact that it was recommended by Charlie Fox said something to me as well."
3,"OK, I guess","This movie is OK, I couldn't really seem to follow the continuity of the story (I'm not even sure there was a story), but I got what I wanted out of thid movie, a disc full of dark-haired fair skinned Asian women."
1,Would give it negative stars if I could,"Nothing but trouble from the day installed. We have spent hundreds of dollars on 3 different plumbers to try to make it remain stable. Over time (days to months) the base loosens and it wobbles. The company sent replacement parts (twice) to no avail. Several plumbers have groaned as soon as we mention ""Grohe"". Also - the rubber at the top disintegrated. My advice - don't even consider. Cute, stylish, yet totally disappointing."
1,"Poor choice, now looking for a replacement","I have had this faucet for a few years, and am now looking for a replacement (NOT Grohe!). First, the flimsy plastic piece that attaches the hose to the faucet body cracked, leaking water under the sink. We had to wait for many days before our dealer could obtain a replacement. Now the metal body in the pullout section has cracked, and the unit sprays water at right angles to the faucet when the water us turned on. I have this part of the unit wrapped with tape until I get a new faucet. The spray section has never worked very well from day one."
3,"works good for hotsync, but NOT a charging cable for the SJ-22","This item claims to be a USB/Charging cable for the Clie models listed. Well, it is not a Charger for the PEG-SJ22. I have tried it at several different computers and it does not charge the thing. There is no where to plug power to it either, like the original factory connector had. So be cautions, you may need to hunt down a seperate charger.I do like the connection though, it seems tighter than the factory hook up. My original Charger/connection would always have a loose connection ant then it finally broke."
3,Informative but boring to read,I don't consider the material very interesting to read. They are facts not stories. The material could be written better.
3,Very nearly lost me at the introduction.,"The foreword/introduction by Forbes turned me off hard initially by stating that the individuals storied in this book are heroes at the same level as soldiers. I don't care who you are in the business world -- that is false. The only real risks these people took were financial, and making money by taking risk doesn't make you a hero, it makes you a successful businessperson and capitalist.That ridiculous sentiment aside (in the author's defense, he didn't write it), there is some valuable content here, and while I didn't feel blown away, I didn't feel that I had completely wasted my time, either. The book covers a lot of stories in a short span and provides enough detail that you get a feel for each history without getting lost in trivialities."
4,Great Business Stories are inspirational and well done.,If you would like to read about those who have succeeded despite failure and set back these inspirational stories are great. They are well written as well. You learn from other people's success and failure and this book is a good source for that.Daniel R. Murphy[...]
1,Horrible quality,"We had such high hopes for this colander. It was beautiful. Within months it started to rust around the rim. Shortly thereafter it started rusting around the drain holes rendering it totally useless. A colander should last years, not months. Only buy this if you never plan on using it."
2,Will not hold up with minimal use,"I bought this item because I wanted a funcitonal colander that was also a nice match to my kitchen decor. I've had it for six months, have used it maybe 20 times to drain pasta or hold fruit/veggies while I wash. I always air-dry it out immediately after use and washing. The paint started chipping and the metal underneath started rusting almost immediately. VERY POOR QUALITY is how I would rate this item!"
2,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!,"Very pretty when I first got it! I chose the magenta one. But the first time I placed it in the dishwasher, it came out with what seemed like bleach spots all over it. The pretty hot pink enamel is completely ruined. This would have matched my kitchen perfectly, but I'm now using it on my patio as a plant container."
5,Gives the reason why R/3 works well and isn't easy to ...,"If you can access to R/3 and want to understand the reason why and how ERP pakages works well, then this book is the best help. Sheer's excellent Business Process Enigneering provides thorough description of the data model in R/3, but this book's methodology is a key to understand how the data model is implemented in R/3 and how it is used to configure your own business process with R/3's complete reference model of business processes."
5,Excellent Book,"After you go thru this book, you will find a very clear picture on how SAP works is already in your mind. This book gives your detail explanation, so easy to follow it up. Highly recommend this books!"
3,Nice clock but loud,"This is a very nice clock, easy to read, but when the house is quiet, the ticking sound is quite loud."
2,Seconded: Nice clock but loud,"This is a good-looking, easily readable wall clock. At night, when all is still, this clock can definitely be heard ticking (actually, more of a ""tock""). The clock is in our bathroom, but, in the contemporary style, our bathroom is off the Master Bedroom without a door. The tocking can be heard 40' away in bed. Previous atomic clocks which I have owned of other manufacturers have not ticked at all.I haven't had this clock long enough to know whether or not it will automatically change for Daylight Savings but the instructions say that it will.I've downgraded it because the ticking is really annoying. It did change from daylight savings to standard time as advertised.I would not buy it if I could do it over again."
3,would not buy again,"sticks are a little too small for me to easily handle. Also threads seem to stick , not as well designed as I had hoped."
4,Review of John Wesley DVD,"This is a very interesting review of the life of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist church. It is very enlightening and generates respect for the man and the struggles he went through to become the great man he was. I would recommend this DVD to any others interested in learning about this great man."
2,Older vintage than I expected,"Very 1950's, crackly audio, not what I expected. Accurate sermons and time period detail, however, difficult to justify it's usage in a local church based on it's dated appearance."
5,Pretty great,This cd features some great swinging guitar work and excudes a feeling of rambling warmth. Listen to the samples and see if it's a good fit for you.
1,Liberal Pap,"Wow, this author scared me! Did you know that a Baptist denomination resists abortion and thinks that homosexuality is incompatible with the Bible? Why, it's absolutely unthinkable! Yes, the Southern Baptists must be stopped. Being anti-abortion is just like being a Nazi, you know. I personally plan to marry my pet pig, and those evil Southern Baptists might tell me that bestiality is wrong. (Thank God there aren't many Baptists in Vermont!) Thank God this book makes it so clear that there is a denomination that believes the Bible. It's so, so scary."
5,Another winner from Emma Holly,"I've read all of Ms. Holly's Black Lace titles and with each one, she delivers a sexy, satisfying love story. Velvet Glove is her best yet. Enjoy."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I enjoy this author but this tie me up & spank me stuff, isn't my thing, if it's yours you might like this book."
1,Please,I love Emma Holly I'll be the first to admit it but this book was so wrong that I just don't know where to begin. Audrey likes to have sex. She likes to have sex with everyone. Thats basiclly the book in a nutshell. She seems to have no other qualities besides whats between her legs. Boring! Lets have alittle depth. Patrick was alittle likeable and then theres the drag queen roomate Basil (What). I don't know and I don't know if you will either. I read some other reviews and found theres to be good but unfortunetly I don't like everybody in the book having sex with one another. Mrs. Holly I would recommend giving a little more depth to your characters even tho it's erotica. If you like erotica try Rhyannon Byrd!
1,Why $249.99 for the booster pack,I'm looking at the price listed for this booster pack and it shows $249.99? That can't be right. It's only $19.99 on the hasbro site.
4,German Tour Edition,This is actually the German Tour edition which has a hand drawn cover and contains a mini comic of the video for I Don't Like The Drugs... It's interesting if you're a Manson collector like myself but otherwise it's the exact same as the domestic versions.
1,Astro Pops?,I lived for my weekly (sometimes daily) astro pop in the nineties. WHERE IS IT? I couldn't be more disappointed.
5,Candy in a bag,I bought this for My little brother for his 13th Birthday gift and he told Me I was his coolest sister & he loved all the candy that came with it
4,Great gift,"If I had the time I could probably hunt down all these candies and package them in a basket for 33% of the price, but who wants to go through all that trouble. This was nicely packaged and the 28-year-old friend I gave this to loved it! It was all the candy he wasn't allowed to buy as a pre-teen kid! Some memories from the snack bar at my little league games were also in there."
3,good amount but missing key items,"i purchased this one and the 80's one and they basically had the same candy in each. there were some differences, but were missing popular candy that we remembered at each time.the amount of candy and the freshness were great, but for the price of the box and shipping- i could have put something cheaper together myself.it was a cool concept and gift, but disappointing when opened."
5,Sugar Rush,"Opening the box gives a sensory sugar rush! It would have been difficult to collect all the different candies represented in this collection, so you can justify the cost. I got it for my son to remind him of his childhood favorties. It is a fun gift for the drug store candy lover."
1,retro candy disappointment,"This was a big disappointment. Overpriced and quite skimpy. Could have put it together myself for far less. Too bad, the concept is good."
2,Too sour!,"Everything in the box was either sour, extra sour, or extremely sour. The only non-sour items were the four pieces of Bazooka gum. If I knew what was included I would have never ordered it."
3,"Classic guide to data, NOT a personal guide to recovery","This book will be perfectly suited to readers seeking a particular resource--namely, data pertaining to rape rates, reporting, and historic sociological/legal research--but would not be the book of choice for someone looking for a resource for personal guidance through rape recovery. As long as this distinction is clear, readers will be pleased to find an academic text, and not a self-help guide, workbook, or recovery support. This book remains a classic, although readers should be aware that this is a current edition of a book that explores the implications of studies from a couple of decades ago. The relevance, then, is that it reveals how epidemic rape has been for a long time, not that it offers cutting-edge recent academic data."
4,"Yes, he is a nasty one...","Dear former commenters...you have the right to be disgusted by Nathan J. Yoder's comments. He is a vile, power-tripping, egotistical, pseudo-intellectual who revels in debate. Feel free to ignore his irksome commentary.This book is not perfect...but it will be helpful to rape victims and many woman interested in the sociology of date rape."
3,College Educator's opinion,"I find this book to be an excellent referral however, i'd prefer to see a revised edition. The statistics are outdated but the story is excellent."
1,Dissappointing waste of money.,"Terrible sequel to the outstanding ""Predator"". Danny Glover takes over for Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cop out to catch the title character. The result is a lot of violence but no real plot."
2,What the hell are you? ...a bad sequel.,This is one of the worst sequels I have seen. Danny Glover is way over the top and Bill Paxton is more like a used car salesman than a cop. Gary Busey is actually the best actor in the whole movie. Don't believe the great reviews on Amazon- if you liked the first Predator just stick with it and pretend this one doesn't exist. 2 stars for Gary Busey and Stan Winston's work.
4,Action / Thriller,I received the movie Predator 2 within a week in good condition. The service was awesome.
4,He's back...,"The original Predator set the standard for sci-fi action pics while having Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of the hero. This much underrated sequel takes place in L.A. years after the original film concluded. Danny Glover stars as a burned out detective on the trail of a series of grusome murders, only to find that the Predator is back on the hunt. While Predator 2 is no where as good as the original, it is a very good film on its own, plus we get to see more of the Predator culture and some rather cool weaponry, plus more insight on their hunting rituals. A decent cast is here as well, featuring Gary Busey, and Bill Paxton. A little side note: when Glover is on board the Predator ship looking at the skulls, you'll notice the skull of an Alien from the Alien series of films on the wall."
4,I thought it was better than the original,"Maybe its because I like Danny Glover as an actor. This sequel by Director Stephen Hopkins, to me, is a better film. While the action was interesting in the original Predator movie, the characters in Predator 2 are more real. You can identify with them, as people. I'd say the jungle of an urban American environment, just might be more dangerous than anything you'd march into in Central America. This would have rated 5 stars if not for the somewhat weak ending. Great sci-fi this."
2,It's pretty bad,"I really didn't like this movie. I know it was trying to be unique by bringing the predators to the city, but I found it just stupid and I really didn't care about any of the characters. The ending scene I thought was pretty cool, but most of the rest of the movie was just obscene and crass."
4,predator 2,"i love the 1st predator it's a classic and one of the best movies of all time. predator 2, some like and some dont. i personally like but is it better than the 1st one, no. instead of having arnold shwarzennager, they had danny glover in it instead. he's a good actor and all (i mean he was in lethal weapon and the color purple) but he's no arnold shwarzennager. i would recomend this to anyone who likes predator but its not near as good as the 1st one."
4,Looks to be intersesting!,"This electrifying action sequel unleashes the deadly invisible Predator in another jungle -- the urban jungle of Los Angeles. Danny Glover stars as a lieutenant who mistakenly concludes that mangled bodies found by the police are the work of feuding gangs. Instead, he finds himself confronting a savage alien who has come from a distant world to hunt humans for sport. Gary Busey and Ruben Blades co-star in this suspense-packed, high-tech thriller.Special Features:* Commentary by Director Stephan Hopkins and Writers Jim Thomas and Scott Thomas* The Hunter and The Hunted* Easter egg: Gag Reel* Promotional Gallery* Original Theatrical Trailer* Trailer A,B,C* Original TV Spots: Weapons, Jungle Revised, Much Worse, Thrill of the Hunt, In Town* The Predator goes to Town (1990)* Int'l Featurette (1990)* Creating the Ultimate Hunter* Hard Core Segments: Hard Core Special Report: City at War* Hard Core from Penthouse to Slaughterhouse: A Special Report* Still Gallery[...]"
1,It's sooo hot.,"The characters constantly complain about how hot it is, but they refuse to take off their jackets, and overcoats. I just couldn't get past that."
3,Skip the First Hour!,"The first hour is terribly written and acted; the last 45 minutes almost make up for it. Almost. Since we--the audience--have already seen the Predator, why hold him back until the second half of the movie? No idea. The producers and director Stephen Hopkins thought it was better to follow the lead of the first film, when all fans wanted from this go-around were moneyshots. (I'm sure they talk about it in the two separate audio commentary tracks, but I don't know if I'm willing to put that kind of time into PREDATOR 2.) The film expands on the Predator mythology of the first film nicely, though, introducing a larger cast of the alien hunters and some wicked weapons. A nice distraction while waiting for PREDATORS to debut this weekend."
1,Good Sequals Are Few and Far Between (This Is No Exception),"I'm sorry, this movie just didn't do it for me. I saw the first Predator was immediately hooked. I didn't see the sequal for several more years, and when I finally did, I was very dissapointed. Without Ahhnold (or anyone exceptionally big) the movie just didn't seem as good. The first one was all about the action, thrills, and effects. This one was about how much swearing and sexual ""stuff"" as they could fit into a two hour time frame. I could do without all of that, I want good action, a worthy plot, and good acting. This movie lacked all of that. The action was slow, boring, and just not the same.If you want a good movie, stay away from this and go with the original -- or even the Alien series, the first one (the only one I saw) was just as good. However, I also advise you all stay away from wasting money on AVP. Rent is when it's cheap, or borrow it from a friend. Not worth paying nearly $10 to see at the theater or $20 to buy it."
2,A small shadow of the original.,"A mediocre reprise. Saw this when I liked Danny Glover due to his role as protector of americas children, a cop. I like Gary Busey as an actor also. If you have never seen it, go rent it and watch it once. It is not a 1 star movie, but it is bad enough. Having Glover and Busey in it, brings it up from a 1 star script and a 1 star story. ..."
3,Highs & Lows,"Predator 2 is probably one of the worlds most underrated sequels. ""But it doesnt have Arnold"" the people cry... & many missed out on a great flick. The story is tight, the action scenes well done, even the acting is overall pretty good (something many action flicks, incl Predator 1 cant boast). But it does have flaws... The mysterious quality of the original is far lessened. And the greatest sin of all... this DVD is only 108 minutes??? Yup they *CENSORED* entire scenes from the film! Remember the fight scene between the Pred & El Scorpio at start? Its almost entirely gone (no net, no spear, no claws, no nothing!). Other scenes are also trimmed (reduced gore mainly). Id rather see if a special edition is later released, or else buy the overseas versions (region4 has the entire US theatrical release)"
4,"Great movie, Jungle is better than L.A",Well I must say I loved the first one. It was a great story and a great setting. Predator 2 is not as real becuase it is in the city not in a jungle. Danny Glover is the perfect guy for the job. He is funny and is a great cop in movies. I really believe that the jungle is a perfect setting for this type of story. I am very very sad that they didn't make a 3rd. Glover and Arnold team up to fight their way through the predators. I loved the 2nd but the first will always be my fav
2,Misses the mark,"While the sequel does expand upon the Predator mythos a little and does a few things right, it's definitely inferior, because all of the characters except for Danny Glover's are so annoying and abhorrent that they almost make the Predators look like good guys in comparison. Gang members, drug dealers, mysoginistic cops, let 'em all die, I say. It takes all the tension out of your movie if you're praying for the monsters to get the characters."
4,Surprising Good!,"Danny Glover does a good job following up as the new prey to be hunted. This time it is in a future Los Angeles that looks like the Detroit of Robocop, with gangs and crime running rampant. Glover, a much better actor than Arnold gives a more believable and highly entertaining performance as an LA Cop who gets pulled into the pursuit of the alien predator who is preying on the ""toughest"" good and bad guys in LA for sport.Maria Conchita Alonzo and Ruben Blades also put in good performances as Glovers partners on the LA Police Force. Gary Busey as a seedy government agent looking to track and capture the predator alien. Little does he know that the alien has a lot more tricks up his sleeve than he bargained for.The movie is begging for a follow-up because in one scene we see a whole slew of predator alien hunters showing off their trophys."
5,Predator 2,"Excellent as good as the first, where's Predator 3 and why hasn't someone put this ave. 4 star rated movie on DVD yet?"
4,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BUT...,"Predator 2 was inevitable based on the fact that predator was such a hit but the story goes, Arnold was busy making the Running Man so he didn't participate in the sequal. Overall Predator 2 was a good sequal, but the best part of this movie is the scene in the predator's space ship where it showed the alien skull, because that 3 second shot was the insperation for the AVP movie(s)."
4,"Excellent Sequel, But Glover Is No Schwarzenegger!!!!!!!!!!!","Let's face it, most of the time sequels really bite the big one, however, this is definitely an exception. Usually sequels fall prey to a nutty screenwriter, a power-crazed director or sellout producer, but with series creators Jim & John Thomas and producers Lawrence Gorden, John Davis and Joel Silver of the original this sequel was in good hands from the get-go. Another fast-paced, action-packed, special-effects extravaganza with a little more plot, some inventive ""hunting"" via the Predator (and plenty o' gore and carnage I might add) and some good humor (mostly one-liners). My only complaint is that Glover (a bit old to be portraying the alien-butt kicking cop) seems a little out of place. Still, all in all, a great sequel with a perfect set up for Predator 3 (directed by Robert Rodrigez)."
2,Nowhere near as good as the original,"The original Predator [Blu-ray] was a sci-fi classic. Predator 2, by contrast, is a more typical sci-fi/horror junk film. It's not the worst movie ever, but certainly wasn't a worthy sequel (unlike Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)). It takes place in a big city, filled with drug addicts and prostitutes. Frankly, you don't really care if any of the characters end up getting killed. Schwarzenegger was asked to return for this movie, but read the script and... Read more"
4,Welcome To The Jungle...,"No, PREDATOR 2 isn't as explosively intense as the original, but it is an action packed sequel worth seeing. Danny Glover (SAW), while not a replacement for Arnold (but then, who could / would be??), is quite good in his cop role. He finds himself in the middle of circumstances far beyond his police training when the PREDATOR is loose in LA! Gary Busey (SILVER BULLET) plays a shady government type who wants to capture the murderous creature. As follow-ups go, P2 is certainly better than most..."
1,Predator 2,"I first brought one and when i try to play it nothin g happen then i try 4-times yet nothing.So i used one of my blue ray dvd's it worked, so i sent it back for another one and it happend aqain ik did the same thing aqain i try 4-times and nothing,yet i put one of mine and it was alright.I was really disapointed cause i wanted to watch that movie.But now i wont buy another cause i dont want the haassle."
1,Calling all morons!,"This sequel is so bad it's almost funny. Everything about this movie sucks--the acting, the direction, the plot. The original Predator was an o.k. movie and you can usually count on sequels to be weak, but it's shocking how lame this follow-up is. A studio actually funded this? Or, was this move a summer project for high school students in their A.V. club?"
3,"Good, but not better","How the hell can you people think this is better than the first? The original Predator was one of the best movies of all time. This movie doesn't come close, but is very good......"
2,A shadow of the original,"The original Predator [Blu-ray] was a sci-fi classic. Predator 2, by contrast, is a more typical sci-fi/horror junk film. It's not the worst movie ever, but certainly wasn't a worthy sequel (unlike Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)). It takes place in a big city, filled with drug addicts and prostitutes. Frankly, you don't really care if any of the characters end up getting killed. Schwarzenegger was asked to return for this movie, but read the script and allegedly didn't like it. That should tell you everything you need to know. Too bad. Good news is that there is a new Predator movie coming out soon that looks great."
3,alot like the first,"when i saw this movie i had not yet seen the first film and didn't notice that it had much of the first films scenes in it. the predator takes out his ""first aid kit"" in the first and does so in the second film. He has a man to man fight with the main guy, but thats not to much to cry over. but over all a good action film, so long as thats what you watched it for........"
4,P2 Widescreen finally hits DVD!,"Finally, Predator 2 is out on DVD. And in widescreen. And it came out on my birthday. What more could a diehard Predator fan ask for? Seriously, this is a great DVD to own if you like action or sci-fi movies, or if you loved the first one. Now the story line isn't all that involved, and parts need a lot of help (he breaks the medicine cabinet without looking for band-aids? Hehe), but the movie wasn't really all that bad. It's fast paced, it was suprisingly well cast considering they made a sequel without Ah-nold, and doesn't deserve most of the bad press it gets.As for the brand-new DVD version-even better. You get two of these cool behind-the-scenes things, the theatrical trailer, and the movie is presented in widescreen format (P2 never made it to the Fox Widescreen VHS collection, remember).All in all not as good as the first outing, but then again, are sequels ever? Pick this up. Watch people die. Laugh at them. Have a great time with this one, it's really easy."
3,"pretty good, not the original though","I just wanted to say to Rich, re: Vegitarian ethics, October 24, 2002 (Rich from SF, CA): What a well-written, insightful review. Youre completely insane, of course, but you can write!Anyway, this one will certainly pass the time, but its not as good as the original. The scene in the meat plant is enough to make your mouth water; I feel like grilling up a burger every time I see it..."
2,Not Good,"I loved the first one, but this is rediculious! The predator looks way different...! In the first one, he took off his mask and looked greenish white, like a ghost crab..., but in this, he looked pink! And it looks like his brain is popping out!"
3,predator 2,"I like this film, but it didn't quite have the same suspense as the first one. The Predator looks cooler in this one, but it didn't have the same feel as the first one. I liked the ending, and I hope they come out with Predator 3, or Aliens vs. Predator."
3,"Eh, not great, but entertaining","This movie, while definitely not the first one, has its own interesting scenes. Like the Predator in the bathroom fixing his wounds. But, this movie just wasn't the same as the first one. It wasn't as ""edge-of-your-seat,"" nor did the Predator look as good. Worth your money, however."
3,What's so bad about this one?,"Predator 2 is a film that I believe should get some lime light. A lot of people I talked to said it was horrible. In fact I enjoyed the movie oodles and oodles. It may not be a classic like the original Predator with Arnold but this one is no short stop either. If you like action, Predators, and cops prone to violence this movie is reccomended to you."
2,GREAT CREATURE! & GOOD IDEA! & POOR SCRIPT = OK SEQUEL!,"It's a shame that the makers of this movie didn't finish this promising , but incoherent script. I liked the original 'Predator' film and a sequel could have been interesting and fun. Unfortunately, the film doesn't know what it wants to be, it's serious one minute and then it's a satire? This throws off the balance of the entire film. Between plot holes and contrived situations it just feels rushed. With a few tweaks here and there this could have been very good.It's OK popcorn fair, but it will never come close to the original. Once again a great creature design and some new cool weapons are introduced, but this film ultimately leaves you dissatisfied. The 2 disc DVD transfer looks very good and there are more than enough extras on the set."
5,Great guy movie,"Perfect for guy's night, action, science fiction, a true 90s classic. Predator has been my favorite sci fi character for years."
3,Predator 2,"It was ok...not as god as the original with the governator lol. But it was alright. I would watch the first one, or predators if u haven't seen those"
5,This Movie Rocks!!! (And I Would Like A Date With Ms. Alonso!!!),"This movie is a rarity as a sequel because in my opinion it surpasses it's predecessor. Danny Glover plays ""Action Man Super Cop"" who is on the hunt for someone or something who is killing all of the Drug Lords in 1997 L.A. I haven't as yet figured out why this is a bad thing but Hey what do I know? This movie is redeemed and enhanced by the presence of the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso who has a very unique way of introducing herself to her new partner.!!! Watch this movie and you will see what I mean!!~"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"There is no doubt that the first Predator goes down as one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever, but this sequel is nothing more than a slapped together piece of hollywood trash they thought they could get away with. I might ruin the plot for you with my complaints: 1. Danny Glover kills a Predator in hand-to-hand combat. (Come on....) 2. Afterwards another Predator gives Danny an 18th century pistol. (Makes sense to me... oh, no, wait, it doesn't) 3. The Predator decides to hunt members of crazy Voodoo gangs that are in some sort of drug war. (Excitement ensues as the Predator slaughters a bunch of druggies like cattle) 4. There are actual scenes dedicated to showing Danny Glover as a renegade cop. (NOBODY CARES!) 5. Somebody thought ""hey, this script is worth making into a movie"" (It surely was not)"
2,Oh please...,Terrible script.Poor acting.And Danny Glover whispers his way through this movie.Two Stars for the Predator scenes.
3,predator,"this was a gift for grandson, too much blood and violence. If I was a parent, it would not be permitted in my home."
4,Cool DVD.,"Why do 'geniuses' write about how much they like or hate the Bluray version under the reviews for the DVD format. This is the DVD version 'Einsteins'. If you want to spew about how much you like or hate the Bluray version, order a brain on Amazon and then write the Bluray review under the Bluray product. I have included this link because the ""Bluray-version-reviewers"" can't tell the difference between Bluray and DVD, you probably aren't bright enough to search this link on your own.Predator 2 [Blu-ray]I like the DVD version. Cool movie."
2,Doesn't hold up to the first,"The first Predator was a classic. However, P2 falls short with its flimsy plot and cheesy acting. Not one of Glovers best, I give it 2 stars because I like the Predator and the ending is fun to watch. The rest is crap."
2,At Least It's Better Than The First One,Decent effects and more action make this one better than the first...But as far as I'm concerned thats not saying much. Stephen Hopkins is a solid director though. See Under Suspicion which he directed about a year or so ago.
1,Predator 2,"What made the original ""Predator"" so exciting and entertaining was, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger, but also the swamp-like setting and incredible cinematography. Danny Glover is no Arnold, and a large suburban city just doesn't seem to be a believable place for a kill-crazy creature from another world to wreck havoc. The script is laughable, the effects are disappointing, and the star power of Glover and Busey is unfortunately wasted. A sequel that never should have happened. Director: Stephen Hopkins. Cast: Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Ruben Blades, Maria Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Kent McCord, Morton Downey Jr. Rated R for violence, gore, profanity, and nudity. 108 minutes."
1,danny glovebox should be punished for this,"danny glovebox portrays the most hateful character ever in movie history - his idiotic policeman is literally incontinent with rage, splashing it over all the other characters and his own trousers in every horrible scene he is in. this is 2 hideous strike outs for glovefinger what with his lethal weapon abomination. seriously, this guy should be banned for life from ever scarring people's eyeballs again with this painful crud. i'll tell you what though, if they ever bring out a director's extended version of this i will be first in line for a copy provided that the extra extended scenes are all of glovebox being tortured and made to say sorry for what he has done. i'd pay a million dollars for that and i just don't have that kind of money. in summation, predator the original, yes sir; predator the glovehole abomination, dear god please, i'm begging you, punish glovefinger or i will know you do not exist."
1,Insulting.,"This sequel is an insult to the original 5 star movie. I found myself fast forwarding to get to a good part which never seemed to come. Dont even think of buying. If you are curious, wait for 99cent rental night. Glover is good but plot, action and everything else is rock bottom."
2,Not as good as the first,"I don't know why, I just simply didn't like this as much as the first. When watching the first, not only was I really entertained, I really wondered about the Predator: its history, where it comes from, etc. I thought maybe the second would address this: perhaps giving us a glimpse at his home planet. But it didn't: the closest is when it shows the inside of his ship. And I just can't understand Danny Glover being the one to save earth from an interplanetary hunter. Maybe Arnold's acting wasn't as good, but at least he looks the part. And I also thought setting it in a city would make it better: more targets. But it didn't. It was good in places, and showed off more Predator weaponry, but I still have to recommend the first."
1,Danny Who?,"First off, there is NO WAY this movie is better then the first one. Its not even in the same class. Who ever thinks this is better then the first one is just plain dumb.Secondly, NO WAY would oldman glover have beaten the Predator and thats what kills this movie and makes it suck. Not even if Rigs was with him could they have beaten him, I mean it took both him and Rigs to beat jet Li and hes HUMAN!Now is it worth buying? Only if you're a real Predator fan and HAVE seen the first one 100,000 times. Its worth watching maybe every 5 or 6 years for the last 20 minutes of the movie."
4,where's the damn DVD version of this?,"I just wanna say that this movie is awesome, and in my opinion better than the first. I see the original for sale on dvd at every store I go to and i'm just wondering where the sequel is. It's out on dvd in the UK, but that doesn't do me any any good since my dvd is not coded for region 2 or PAL. So lets get this great action sequel out on dvd, so I can enjoy it even more."
5,Highly recommend these tapes,"I highly recommend Fredric Lehrman's work on Prosperity Consciousness.After reading and studying many works on success, money and the like, I've found these tapes to be very useful.Money really can be an easy part of your life. These tapes can start you on your way."
3,Can't hurt,"Older program from a self help mail order Co. Their deal is listen to it for 30 days & if not satisfied send it back. I didn't pay too much for it so I'm not disappointed. Lots of stuff about old programs still affecting you as an adult about $$$. The bit about multiple bank accounts seems tedious. Seems like a few envelopes would do the same. I'm a Residential Re-modeling contractor & in this ""New Normal"" I'm having a hard time filling even one.Listen to this,read that, but filling your head full of sunshine still won't change the fact that the economy is in a fog. I can't see how I can ""Walk on the sunny side of the street"" when both sides are cloudy."
4,ENERGETIC GIULINI,"Giulini is masterful throughout. Photography, while b&w;, is pretty crisp, not faded.I did not experience the sound problem related by the other reviewer. Sound is mono but played at equal volume through both my speakers. Suspect he had a wiring problem."
2,Great performance ruined by manufacturer,"This concert film revealed the reason why Giulini was so popular ever since 1960's. Great performance!However, EMI should make apology or recall all the dvd of this title because the sound track can only be heard from the left loudspeaker--really weird enough ""mono"" type. I purchased from the authorized retailer,not pirate edition!"
5,Should be a movie.,"Very, very good. I was hooked and couldn't put it down right from the start. An unlikely hero in an impossible situation always makes a great read."
1,Don't Start Reading Until You Have Time To Finish It All!!,"I started this book yesterday and could not stop reading until it was finished. This is an extremely captivating book.Some reviewers have pointed out that it may not be a completely accurate representation of history or reality. True, but it is supposed to be fiction. L'Amour's talent lies in telling extremely captivating tales in a easy-to-read, descriptive style. This book surely fits the bill and I plan on reading it many times in the years to come."
2,Down the Long Hills,"This book isn't one of Louis L'Amour's best. There were a few exciting moments, but the times between them were very dull. I thought he put to much into describing the settings and didn't put enough into the story. After reading other books by Louis L'Amour, I would have to say I was disapointed. For example when the Indians raided the wagon train, the story was talking about the two children bringing the horse back instead of talking about the raid. Two children being alone in the wilderness isn't that exciting. I have to admit it did get better towards the end, but I like to be able to get into a book from the start."
5,The Book That Started it All!,This was the first book that I had ever read! I had problems reading and really didn't see a point in learning how until my father handed me this book. I is a epic story that capture the bond between animal and man (or child as it were). This book has help all of my kids to find their enjoyment of literature. I commend Louis (RIP) for his ability to paint a picture on the pages of this book and the many more that he wrote.
4,L'Amour's only Golden Spur Award winner,"I was surprised to see a rating average of only 4 and a half stars on this one. This is the only book for which L'Amour ever won a Golden Spur Award from Western Writers of America! It is definitely different from anything else he ever wrote, and a great coup, I thought. I usually don't give any L'Amour's more than three stars, but this one sure deserved it. It kept to L'Amour's trademark of no sex, no graphic violence, and little cursing, and I like that a lot. For that reason, if you like L'Amour you just have to read all of the books by the author critics are calling The New Louis L'Amour, Kirby Jonas. He is tremendous, and may one day even replace L'AMour. L'Amour was always my favorite, but Jonas has edged him out. You have to read this guy!"
2,Book level too high for age listed,"This is not the book I thought it was going to be. It lists an appropriate age level, however when I have used it with that age group it has been WAY above their heads. I would suggest looking for a lower book."
2,don't forget to register the warranty,"shortly after i bought it, it no longer works. should have registered the waranty!"
3,good stuff,"I waited so long to buy this because I heard so many bad reviews about it. Don't believe them. The quality is not half as bad as people say. I finally broke down and bought it. I was expecting crap but was quite surprised. Does it have the prodution of say dimmu- no, but it is decent. It is really good. Production is much worse on so much more out there - darkthrone, ulver, immortal etc. If you can stand those -you'll have nom problem w/ this. The morbid stuff is great - very necro sounding much like early mayhem. I stay away from boots mostly - but this one is good - plus it is the only studio mayhem stuf w/ dead.worth the $$"
3,pure black insanity,"Mayhem--without a doubt the kings of the black metal scene along with Darkthrone. Killer Mayhem material but the whole thing is brought way way down by Morbid who can't decide if they are death, black, or punk...pretty bad stuff even if you are the avid black metal fan. I'd say find someone who has it and do a tape trade like I did cuz it ain't worth the $20 import price."
4,Simple and straightforward. And not too deep.,"This film is very straightforward. The scene is a prison, which has regular boxing matches between the inmates. Wesley Snipes, who is serving a life sentence, is the undisputed champion. And then Ving Rhames, the real world champion, is accused of rape in a very similar scenario to that of Mike Tyson. He's sentenced to the prison too. Naturally there is conflict as the two men lock horns.There are no surprises in this film as it builds to its inevitable climax, with Peter Falk cast as a Mafioso inmate who arranges a boxing match inside the prison walls. The acting is uniformly good. And the script well written. That's about the most to be expected from this kind of film.Frankly, I rather liked it. Maybe because it didn't try to be anything but what it was. Therefore I give it a mild recommendation."
4,starightforward and entertaining,"A straightforward movie of the usual Hillbent-men who are men, but not undercomplicated, in situations that test them. Although it might be argued that the Snipes character is the ""good guy"", there really is no full on bad guy. Rather, you have a wonderful muddle of ambiguous characters. The sidekicks are interesting in that each seems better suited not for who he is paired up with, but for that opponent of that pairing. Though I recommend the film, I am reminded in watching it that Rhames is no actor; he offers the same flat I-must-be-cool approach to his roll in this film as he did in Pulp Fiction or Mission Impossible or Dark Blue."
1,Beyond Stupid - Very predictable,"This is got to be the lamest movie I have seen in a while. During the entire viewing, you already know the two main characters are going to fight. But the movie tries to place some diversions to make you think ""oh no, the warden is mad, now the fight isn't going to take place."" Give me a break. Not to mention during the character definitions, you already know who is going to win the fight before the movie is even into the first 20 minutes. If you still feel to so compelled to watch it, I would recommend skipping the whole story (because there really is no story) and go straight to the fight. At least you can recover an hour of wasted life."
2,rather disappointing,"Let me tell yall why, because of the previews and the way the movie was described of the case I was expecting this movie to be loaded with boxing. This movie was kind of weak. I did enjoy the fight towards the movie. Lets get to the story it's about a ten year undefeated champ who is in prison for being conviceted of murder(SNIPES)and a boxer in for a rape charge(RHAMES). It's a good thing I only rented this. This just should teach to rent before you buy a movie if you have not seen it in a theater or just watch the movie on TV. Im not saying don't see the movie if you want to than do so. Just rent it before you buy it. I'm Out. PEACE!"
2,What a dissapontment,"What a bunch of nonsense, this is nothing new to the movie scene , lets call it the bad version of ""rocky"". The boxing sequences are very unrealistic, the character develepment was weak. good job walter hill, worst movie to date"
2,my review,"One solution to child support collection problems is to make 50% joint custody the norm. Then there will be no need to have a hugh state beaurocracy enforcement. 50-50 joint custody means both parents will have equal rights and responsibilities, there will be no need for either to pay child support, no need to transfer money or have a state agency to monitor it. If one paren fails to live up to their bargin, only then the other could go back to court and petition for sole custody. The past 30 years have shown the entire social experiment is a failure. Now's the time to change the law and make a better system that works."
5,"The A,D,G strings are BRILLIANT!","After reading good reviews about these, I spent about $300 bucks and bought these and many other types of strings and spent a day comparing. Result: the A, D , and G strings are just BRILLIANT. Well worth the money. The E string was loud but plain and I opted to get the E string elsewhere (Daddario had a really sweet one).VERY impressed with the A,D,G strings, These are the best I've found out there. The E string is better elsewhere."
3,Expensive & must be replaced often,"These are fine sounding strings if you're willing to replace them often. I've found that they sound their best for 2 - 4 weeks. I've even had them lose their ""sizzle"" in as little as a week. Once they pass their prime, they go downhill fast becoming husky and unresponsive. I would guess that the quality control has slipped a bit since they first started making them. When they were first available they lasted for about a month but the last 4 or 5 sets I had, before I switched brands, lasted about 2-3 weeks. The big soloists can afford to change strings every couple of weeks. If you're a student on a limited budget who can't spring for a new set so often, you should go for something else like Dominants. The difference is not that huge and a good sounding Dominant sounds & plays better than an ""over the hill"" Pirazzi."
4,"Great Hunting guide, ""A must have"" for hunting mountain goats","I had no idea Washington even had a sustainable population of these animals until I came accross this book. I am an avid hunter and this came in handy. So if you are going to try and bag one of these elusive creatures, or would just like to watch them climb the cliffs thru your telescope, this is a great book."
4,"Good toys, but crayons need replacing","I got a similar kit a year ago for my 2 year old. She loved being able to draw on the walls, and these crayons left crisp clear, bright lines, unlike some soap crayons. They washed off of skin and tile easily with water, but stained some rubber ducks. Now 3, the crayons are all used up. I know that crayons are packaged individually for sale, but apparently Amazon only caries the large kits. This seems to me like it will lead to a stack of duplicate sponges and toys as I replace the crayons each time."
4,On the cusp of happiness,"The title can indicate the end of East African colonialism and the vicissitudes of love. Both euphoric experiences dissipate with the coming of political and social realities. The brief happiness of independence and romance sustain them across bland, desperate times. The saga covers three generations of Zanzibaris, English, and Mombasans. The author unravels the surprising relations at the end. Curiosity prompted my inquiry into the geography, clothing, and history of the area. Gurnah reveres literary arts. Characters create prose, poetry, and letters while he plays with a passage from Leopold Sédar Senghor."
3,A silly little political romp.,"It manages to be highly offensive to Native Americans & women in the first few minutes. No matter, it was 1947 & nobody cared about such things.William Powell, highly disguised, hams it up as Senator Melvin Ashton, a dim, corrupt, basically harmless politician, until he decides to run for President. He loses his highly confidential diary in which he has written down everything about everybody.Chaos ensues in the search for the missing diary.A gentle satire on the press, big city political machines, (they resemble nothing so much as ""the mob"" in this movie) & the corrupt small brained politicians with no talent we still seem to keep reelecting. A bit dated, to be sure, but still relevant & good for a laugh."
5,Ornette Coleman: In All Languages,"Since my introduction to Ornette Coleman's art, I haven't been able to get enough recordings of his various groups and projects. This album brought so many things together for me and offered a new understanding of Harmelodic music. Hearing the two varied perspectives of the same concepts between Prime Time of 1987 and the original quartet of 1957 was astonishing. Hearing the varience from his original quartet to his experimentation with the two bass players and extravegent rhythm section including one my favorite bass players of all time: Jamaaladeen Tacuma was almost more than I could handle. If you're a true lover of harmelodic music or free jazz or the avant-garde, you've got to have this album. If you have this album or are getting it and like the stylings of Jamaaladeen Tacuma as much as I do, check out his other albums (Dreamscape is one of my favorites)."
1,ornette drowns in mediocrity,"i bought this cd 10 years ago, and i'm afraid to say apart from very random listening it has gathered dust! i love coleman up to around tales of capt black, this cd seems to be just posturing - empty at that. much as it grieves me to critise a great icon of modern jazz i'd advise you to avoid this one - sorry ornette!"
3,Not for the beginner...,"While this book has a wealth of information ranging from f-stop's to shutter speeds, etc . . . it did not provide the guidance that I expected at the beginner level. Two years from now, if I am still trying better my photographic skills this book will act as a great reference."
3,Definitely for the pros,"The key word on this photoguide is ""professional"". I'm a professional wannabe, with decent talent and experience, and I found this guide to be a bit over-whelming. But, maybe I'll grow into it and become a better photographer along the way!"
5,Works Great for my Camper,"I used this selector along with a new Kenwood car stereo to replace the old outdated stereo in my camper. It took some wood working and a little imagination, but it worked out great. Now I use the speaker selector to run all three pairs of my speakers on the camper. With this product I can listen to all three sets at a time, two sets at a time, or just one set. Makes it nice when we're hanging out by the campfire and just want to hear the outdoor speakers while the kids watch a movie inside the camper.I highly recommend to any camper and will gladly show pictures of how I did it. Ditch that dinosaur of a Magadyne and start enjoying music while you're camping."
2,Left channel died after three months use. Very cheap switches and connectors.,"Can't complain too much as I got it for $20. Switches are cheap and stick, connectors are cheap and breakable. For a few months of use, it worked as it was supposed to. All that was needed was occasional wiggling on the switches. After about 3 months of use the left channel died. Can't complain too much for the price, but I will need another unit now."
4,Good device to add additional speakers to system.,Easy install. Added additional speakers to stereo system. Hooked up 5.1 receiver. multi-room additions. Sound quality good. Small foot print.
1,Horrible speaker selector,"Poorly made, the back input bracket snapped off as I was trying to put the speaker wire in. The selector on the front gets stuck. This really is a cheap shoddy product that caused more frustration than anything. Sent it back and still looking for a viable replacement."
2,cheap,"Cheap is the pro/con of this item.It works, kinda, for how long who knows.Buttons get stuck, sound is just OK. Was too much of a POS for my needs, I returned it."
1,Speaker Selector,"Not the best quality product, one of the switches is stuck in and it happened the second day of use. The price is good if your looking for something simple and low quality."
1,Buttons stick,"Very easy hook up, etc. First day A & B speaker buttons stuck and would not pop out. Tried repeatedly to no avail. C & D worked properly, over and over. Returned and will try another brand."
3,"Works, but....","Product works. But the text is easaly removed. If you use anything other than a soft cloth or klenex to remove the dry erase, the ruffer material will remove the copier text. Do not spray cleaner on this. It is paper and will fall apart. If you have to clean it, spray the cleaner on the cloth and be very carful. A way to protect the copier text would be great."
4,An old master,"This mystery is old fashioned - a 1940's period piece, but written by one of the old masters of the genre. The plot's the thing, keeping you guessing until the great and satisfying ""Aha!"""
1,car wash used to be my favorite song,christina aguilera should be banned from covering old funk tunes like car wash she messed up the whole song but hey anything for money these days and missy elliot's pretty much doing anything these days to stay paid even producing trash like this I hope rose rouce got paid for this.
3,Overall decent.,"This was an overall good recording. We didn't much care for the ornamentation in the ""Badinerie"" of the Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor, but besides this we thought the record was fairly good. As a note to connoisseurs, this is not, in our estimation, as great a recording as Muenchinger's benchmark Brandenburg Concertos of the 1950's. Frankly, we cannot say that this recording comes even close. But we feel it is an overall decent performance of these very important works of the Baroque repertoire."
3,not worth it!,"My daughter had to have this crib for Baby Annabell last Christmas. I was willing to spend the extra money because it was interactive. The mobile is the loudest, most obnoxious toy that my daughter owns. I thought that it would put Annabell to sleep (or maybe even keep her asleep!) but instead it just makes her laugh. My other problem with this crib is that it falls apart very easily. You have to put the posts in the approriate notches to assemble. My 4 year old doesn't leave the crib in one place. If she forgets to pick it up from the bottom, the whole thing falls apart, and she cannot put it back together. If the crib would stay together once it's first assembled, I would recommend it just because my daughter loves the blanket, pillow, and canopy that all have the signature Annabell markings- just take the batteries out of the mobile! But it is simply not durable enough for the money!"
4,Fun Toy,"My daughter is 14 months old and loves to play with this toy.The mobile part is very loud and could be more of a sleepy song but my daughter loves it. It is easy to put together. My daughter gets in there with Annabell, I wish they had a firmer mattress that hide's the slots but my daughter has so much fun with it. It is on the expensive side.The colours are nice. My daughter likes to pull it around also. She has a lot of fun. I wouldn't buy this again, I would look into one with a firm mattress so she could climb in and out of."
4,Night Train - Oscar Peterson,"Nice, easy listening jazz.One tune is repeated and some studio tracks end rather abruptly, but the rest is great."
2,VERY BAD!!!!!!!!!,"I have to say, I was very dissapointed with this album. Peterson, has not yet made an album that is up to the standard as THE WIGGLES!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best of the best,"Unlike many jazz piano lovers, I have never thought Oscar Peterson was showing off or playing too many notes, though I also love Count Basie, whose sparse playing goes in the opposite direction.This album is wonderfully appealing and, could be a great place to start with Oscar if you aren't yet acquainted with his music.I love every track [but only have the original CD], and appreciate the variety on the recording, from C Jam Blueswith its distinctive percussion and piano and double bass solos, to slow ballads like Hymn To Freedom and Things Ain't What They Used To Be through rollicking songs like Night Train and Moten Swing.Another terrific album is Tracks, which is one of few solo recordings."
5,Gives you plenty of choices,This is a great dash kit you can do single din or double or vice versa and it looks good in the dash
5,Big Ben,"Intimate, moving, and oh so sexy..This album is really a pleasure for the senses. As for the less than 40min of album material... Well I can't complain. And for this price..This album has an average review of 5 stars. That just about sums it up."
5,"I Heard it, I had to have it",I caught several songs and the name Webster on Pub Radio while traveling in Alaska several weeks ago. I had to have the CD. Tried local record store giants when I got home to no avail. Then surfed the net where I found the name Ben to go with Webster and found that he and Oscar Pederson had recorded the two songs I had heard. Amazon had the tunes I had heard on line which verified my find. It was a piece of cake once I looked on the net.
5,RELAXED PERFECTION (THEY MADE IT LOOK EASY),"When your lover has gone is NOT taken too slow--it's tempo is flawless, just like the rest of the album. In fact, I still get goosebumps when I hear Old Ben's mournful cry pierce the quiet of the evening on that gem (this CD is ideal for nocturnal listening, whether you're nursing a drink or romancing that special someone). Jazz should not be judged by the tempo at which it is played. After three or more decades in the business, these guys knew at what tempo to play a song."
4,Great book for more drill ideas,"Even though I've coached for a couple of years, this book had great ideas for new drills and twists on old drills."
4,Youth Football Skills and Drill,"Youth Football Skills & Drills: A New Coach's GuideA great beginner's guide to youth football. It is good for coaching the first couple years of tackle football. To be honest, if you have time, internet research can get you good guidance too in coaching youth football. But if you don't have the time nor patience to research the internet, this book is a quick, nicely condensed way to get the info."
2,"Not bad, but not as advertised","I was looking for a book with drills to teach kids the skills at each position. Most of the ""drills"" in this book are simply testing stances and play simulation. For example, it says to teach a D lineman how to beat a block, have a player try to block him and have the defensive player try to beat the block. Great drill? I didn't need a book to figure that out. The book is both very simple and very complex at the same time. While the drills are simplistic, as I said, some of the concepts are for much older kids. Not sure too many 8 year olds have to deal with hook blocks and jerk blocks. It's not a BAD book, just not what is advertised - drills."
2,what a dissapointment : (,"I'm a casual fan of Charles de Lint. I've only read Forests of the Heart and a huge handful of his short stories, but I've generally considered him a good author. However, with Into the Green, we have an author exploring themes he's already done (and better, in ""The Little Country""). Plus, the reader never gets into the minds of the characters and often pages are filled with trite and redundent lamentations of grief, either concerning the main heroine or how tragic it would be if the ""fey wonders of the world"" disappeared. This man can write better than this. If you must read this book, try and get a used copy."
1,Dissapointing,"In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein. If you're looking for something that reaches out to an audience above the age of thirteen, give this one a pass."
5,Among the greatest zombie flicks ever!,"Ok, i'm starting to get tired of people saying this is a ""rip-off"" of Dawn of the Dead. The only thing this movie has in common with DOTD or that people might call it a rip-off because is, 1.There is zombies, but DOTD did not create zombies!, 2. They tried to pull this off as a sequel to DOTD which didn't work then they later got sued by the production crew od DOTD (lol). Those 2 things are not reasons to call this a rip-off of DOTD, ok so now that that's clear on to the movie. This is a great zombie film, the zombies are probally the most detailed i've ever seen in a zombie flick. The scene where the zombie fights the shark is amazing, did you knwo the actor that was suppose to do that got sick and they made the sharks trainer be the zombie! There is also the famous ""splinter in eye"" scene that shook the horror world! This is a great film, lots of gore from the godfather of gor Lucio Fulci. The soundtrack blends in well with this movie, this was a masterpiece!"
5,Fulci lives!,"Let me start by saying that I love this movie and love Fulci. This was the first Fulci flick I had seen and when I first watched it I thought it was a little overrated, it was only after I watched the majority of his other movies that I really learned to appreciate it (let me explain) .This was the one of his movies that failed to shock me. When I watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from ""City"" I was shocked,when I watched the nipple scene in 'Ripper' I was shocked. After time though this grew on me just as much as his other flicks and is one of the best zombie films of all time. FULCI LIVES!"
3,i am going to eat you blah blah blah,"A boat sails into a harbour. On board, a deadly occupant lies in wait, biding its time..waiting to eat someone. And thus we have Zombie, a weaker sister to a much more entertaing film like romero's ""Day of the Dead"". In this one we have the usual assortment of characters. Theres your prototypical mindless zombies who do little to distinguish themselves from their zombie brethren in other films (though one does wrestle a shark which is a new one for me). Theres a doctor, a sexpot,some challenged tourists and the proverbial confining environment (in this case an island)from which there is seemingly no escape. Ho hum. Overall we have an overrated italian flick with poor sound and lighting (though these are improved on the DVD) and a recycled plot. I suppose if return of the living dead or day of the dead are already rented you could do worse than Zombie (read:tombs of the blind dead."
3,poor double disc.....,"but thats okay, because the price of this version is about the same as the other ones. Who really wants to listen to a bunch of old italians praise themselves for ripping off Dawn of the Dead? who wants to see some old hippy play classical guitar badly? the best feature is the zombie trailer reel. the movie itself is pretty slow, but punctuated with some good gore scenes and cool synthesizer music. Watch Burial Grounds instead."
3,Bad but good,"Just shoot them in the head! No, then the movie would be over in ten minutes, and you'd miss the zombie vs. shark spectacle. In spite of the best efforts of bad directing, ludicrous dialouge and something not unlike acting it works. Grimy and gory, with shockingly ineffectual victims dying pitifully and gruesomely at the hands of recently deceased friends and strangers, all avoidable if you just shoot them in the head. Classic line: ""the governor has declared a state of national emergency!""."
2,"Poor picture, average film, not that gory.","If you are planning to by this movie thinking you are going to see one of the goriest films ever, you will be disapointed. There are some gory scenes, but they are few and far between. When the gore scenes do appear, they are well done, but there is a lot of garbage to get through before you see them. The zombies in this film move so slowly that I don't know how anybody could get caught. Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead are gorier films, but the effects in Zombie are better than Dawn, but not as good as Day. There are no stomachs torn open and intestines pulled out, there is a gut munching seen, but you don't see the zombies do the damage(just the after effect). The picture quality is extremely poor and is one of the worst looking DVD's I have seen yet. The commentary track doesn't explain much, but it is OK. I'd advise people to wait for a better transfer to become available if they must have this film. Still, it is uncut!"
3,Same as Zombi 2,"Great film for gore fans. The Sequel to the European version of Dawn of the Dead. Being released by a different company on the same day as ""Zombi 2"". Its better to get that version because it is 2 disc with tons of extras including an extended version on the film."
2,"Sorry Fulci, your work doesn't convince me yet...","Until now, I have heard marvels about Fulci's work. Mmm, I even bought two of his ""finest"" movies: The beyond and Zombie. Both stink!Ok, ok. I accept that the chicks were pretty, as well as their... ahem... curves, and the scene of the eye / spliter was cool, but the rest of the flick is [not that good]. I just liked one of all the zombies.The story is not good, the acting is bad, and there's no depth in any of the characters, only on the girls' bossoms :DRent it, don't buy it."
1,Lousy,"Bad actors, no tension, compaired to Romero this is a D-movie. Really terribly bad. In every way. Poor, weak, lacks quality. Obsolete."
2,ZZZZ,"This movie DOES NOT keep my attention. I like MORE action, LESS talking. There's just too much conversation for a horror film. This movie takes way too long to get to the action and it's really not all that gory. I've seen better, a lot better!"
4,An excellent entertaining zombie flick!,The original uncut version is banned here in England so it took me some time to see the Uncut version. The film is absoulutly brilliant and I would definatly recommened it to anybody! There are some great gore effects (eg. the eye stabbing scene) and pretty good acting. This film is a classic!
5,AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!!!!,"WOW!!!What more can I say. What a way to celebrate the anniversary of Lucio Fulci's masterpiece. Finally, this work of art gets the treatment it deserves. Not only do we get a 2-disc special edition with some interesting extras, but also the original cinema release poster signed by Fulci himself. Any fan should make this their next purchase, you won't be disappointed. Don't miss out, go and get it.Note: This version is still banned in the UK."
5,Fulci delivers the goods,"The late Lucio Fulci may have made plenty of films, but he will always be remembered by his fans as the ""godfather of gore"". His films may be badly paced and clunky at times, but he will always step in with a show stopping special effect to jolt you back to full attention. The highlight of this film has to be the infamous splinter in the eyeball scene. Fulci and FX man De Rossi love eyeball violence, and this features heavily in their films. If you like this, check out Fulci's ""The Beyond"", ""New York Ripper"", or ""Gates of Hell"". Don't expect Hollywood budgets, but do expect shocking violence and gore. Back to the days of the good old video nasty."
3,This was......okay.,"It wasn't the best zombie movie ever, or the worst zombie movie ever. The dubbing get's annoying though. Great amount of gore! The best part was with the shark fighting the zombie, underwater, scene."
3,For Gore Hound Freaks! This Movie Is For You!,"Lucio Fulci's classic gore fest ZOMBIE originally marketed in Italy & all over the world as an unofficial sequel to George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD. While DAWN OF THE DEAD is heralded around the world as a modern classic, ZOMBIE's relation to DAWN OF THE DEAD is only in the zombies, nothing more.ZOMBIE shows some of the most gruesome death & dismember scenes ever put on film. The plot is very thin, as in most of Fulci's films. But if you're a fan of gruesome, bloody, gore movies then this is for you. I admit to enjoying this movie as a guilty pleasure."
3,The best of its kind !,"When this title appears on DVD, I ordered it right away. Great movie. The picture transfer is a bit dark but some adjustment on your TV set should do the trick. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is quite good. Not much surround effect but loud and clear. My only reservation on the DVD is: Not time encoded. So you don't have a clue how many minutes elapsed and when you stop it, none of my DVD players able to resume to last viewed point. This fact prohibit it to be a 5 stars DVD. On to the story, a doctor in a remote island is trying to find the answers on the virus that make people come back from the dead. The tension is stronger than any recent Scream movies. The Italian horror movies always very gory. If you like this kind of movie, this DVD is for you. Now if only Anchor Bay release ""Mountain of cannibal Gods""."
4,Must see for zombie fans!,"I have been an avid fan of the horror film genre for quite some time, and I highly recommend this title to anyone who is a fan of zombies or of classic horror films. From the middle of this film onward, it is fantastic! Warning: it is a little gruesome!"
3,Gorgeous gore & effect music & mood,"Pros: Gorgeous gore (though not as much of it as I expected), effective voodoo & drum music (except for a few synth/reggae moments), eerie overall mood. Cons: poor dubbing, lame dialogue, half-ass plot, mediocre acting (though not as bad as I expected; it's the dubbing which undermines the performances, which aren't really that bad), and I was suprised how much of movie is SLOW. I recommend cranking the music; it really adds. Overall, Fulci squeezed a solid horror piece out of a small budget. The look of the zombies, score, & mood set it apart from hack work, as does the occasional visual flair and creative direction (the build-up to the eye splinter scene is worthy of Argento). Fulci definitely has an ""eye"" for horror. But still, it is a pretty dumb movie folks, with none of the satire, imagination, and pacing than Romero injected into his films."
1,Wretched,"A tedious excuse for a horror film, as boring and as artless as it gets. The gore effects are impressive, but you can't make a movie out of stage blood and sheep intestines."
2,Not The Best Zombie Flick I've Seen!!!,"Sometime back in either March or April when we had a big snow storm, I bought a bunch of Zombie flicks, this one included. I've been reading on the internet that this is 'the best zombie movie ever' to me, it wasn't. One reason I didn't like it because it took too long for the zombie apocalypse to happen. Another thing was that I don't really like zombies on an island. ANOTHER thing I thought was silly was that when you see the zombies, they always have their eyes closed when they're walking and attacking people. At least the gore scenes toward the end were pretty good. If you love zombie flicks, you might like ZOMBI 2!!!"
3,"Hilarious, non-scary and STUPID,STUPID,STUPID!","One comment/question:WHY DO THESE PEOPLE WAIT TO BE ATTACKED BY THE ZOMBIES? THEY HAVE ALL THE SPACE AND OOOOOOODLES OF TIME TO RUN, BUT THEY STAND THERE LOOKING SCARED FOR A GOOD HALF MINUTE WATCHING THE ZOMBIE GET CLOSER! DO THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE GOING TO WIN A OSCAR FOR FRESHLY TOSSING THEIR HAIR TO THE SIDE LIKE A SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL AS THEY LOOK SCARED AND GET ATTACKED? AHHHHHRRRRRGGGGGGG! [LAUGH OUT LOUD]"
2,Dawn of the Dull,"Zombie is basically a cheap knock-off of the ultimately superior Dawn of the Dead, made directly after its release and even passed off in Zombie's native country of Italy as the sequel to George Romero's excellent film. This mediocre-at-best film is the dull story of a group of people who go to a mysterious island in search of a woman's father and discover that it is overrun by vicious, man-eating zombies. Director Lucio Fulci constantly bombards us with pointless blood and guts and the even more pointless ocassional naked woman. He does manage to add some style, but it's lost in the lack of plot and character. END"
5,Best Zombie film in my opinion,"I watch this movie every other month. The best scene is when Auretta Gay (woman with the afro) meets a bad @$$ looking zombie on a island. The make up on that zombie looked so real that I could smell the decomposition through the television. To see the zombie in Gay's eye view from it coming out of the ground to staring down at her was one of the best scenes. When I saw that scene for the first time I had to rewind it a couple of times because it was that good. I have a collection of Fulci's movies. The Beyond is another classic and so is the House by the Cemetery. If you are a horror fan check this movie out, and any other movie by Lucio Fulci. You won't be disappointed."
3,Gory all the way,"Lucio Fulci's ""Zombi"" is a pretty good movie, except for that stupid shark scene. Honestly, shark versus zombie?! And the zombie has coordinated attacks?! Ugh. The movie is about a woman who teams up with a reporter to find out what happened to her father after his boat shows up empty (with a nasty surprise inside). They head out to Matool where the island is about to be overrun by zombies. This movie has voodoo zombies which is always an interesting option to the usual. The film has some pretty nasty (and good) horror scenes. The eye gouging scene has made this movie famous. The movie was slow at first but it picked up during the middle. Except for that shark scene, it was pretty good. It is very gory."
2,"Go beyond the ""eye"" scene, and ....","this film's pretty close to a piece of crap. An obvious rip-off of Romero, the Zombies are lamer (the rotting effect looks good initially but gets real stale very early on); the acting is non-existent (let's get hysterical over nothing, and remain transfixed, unable to move or scream, when a zombie's closing in on you), the plot holes are super-sized (it's never fully explained how they got there, why they're choosing now to wake up, and what exactly motivates them),the special effects second-rate (in one ""feast"" scene, it's so obviously red jello it's laughable, and the shark scene is just stupid)and even the photography is no great shakes. Aurelia looks good, though, in her diving scenes. The whole thing just looks amateurish.Seriously, buy Romero instead. You won't be sorry. If THIS film scares you, you're definitely watching the wrong genre. Try Disney."
1,Ummmmm...OK,"I honestly don't understand why this film has a cult following. I've never liked it, but last night I went home and watched it again since so many people seem to love it. What I found was the same: voodoo has raised an army of flesh-eaters on a remote island, and that's pretty much all that happens of interest in this film. The camera work is blurry and dark, the dialogue is awful, and the scenes go on and on about nothing. To be fair, the film has some fantastic gore effects and truly ghastly zombie makeup, and is almost worth seeing for that reason(unless, of course, you have a weak stomach, in which case, why are you reading this?). It's just that the rest of the film is so dull and pointless that even the gore can't save it. I tried to be optimistic, but this film just bored and depressed me. If you really like Italian horror cinema(which admittedly I don't like very much of), then you'll probably like this. All others, stay away. Far, far away."
2,Ed Wood meets color film,"Fans of Fulci's only. This movie can only be described as a modern ""Plan 9 from outer space"" only with cheesy orange blood as well as cheesy script, acting, actors, setting, make-up and ending. It is obvious Fulci tried very hard on this movie (like ed wood) but just doesn't come close to Romero's work or any other zombie film for that matter. Excellent extras, but for fans of Fulci only! As for the imfamous splinter through the eye scene? It looked like an over-sized barbie doll pulled onto a half-foot long splinter and was the fakest effect I've ever seen, I just laughed. Video nasty? Damn right."
5,One of the best,This movie is just a great zombie movie. I think this movie has all the thrills and chill a horror movie should have. The eye plunged into the glass scene was a true work of art. All in all Lucio Fulci has made the most wonderful macabre masterpeice.
4,This is the version to get.,"There are three versions of this film in the stores now. Anchor Bay's ""Zombie"", Blue Underground's ""Zombi"", and Media Blaster's ""Zombi 2"". These are all the same film. Another reviewer goes over the reason for the name confusion.Since I didn't know about that fact, at one point I had all three versions of this movie. In my opinion, this version (Media Blaster's ""Zombi 2"") has the best transfer and sound of the three. In one of the other versions, I could still see the lines and cracks from the film stock, like I was watching the film on an old 70's high school projector.For those who haven't seen the film, what can I say? It's an Italian Zombie movie. You know what you're going to get with this. It's worth it for the Zombie vs. Shark scene alone!!!"
4,Ultimate Zomie movie,"Like I always say no 10 page summary. Simple, the zombies are better than Romeros in Dawn.O.T.D. The only reason this movie only got 4 stars is cause at one point it drags a bit. But overall the Gore is great the acting and dubbing is excellent . A great zombie movie as Im a big fan of zombie flicks. Zombi 2 by Fulci is definitly the #1 zombie flick, with #2,3,4 and 5 being the whole Romerso series ( Night , Dawn , Day and soon to be Land Of The Dead ). Zombi 2 Came out in 1980."
5,Fulci's Capolavoro. THE Zombie Flick,"I have to hand it to Fulci. When it comes to over-the-top gore and outlandish sequences, he is without peer. Zombie remains one of his best. Yes, it is violent. But that's what makes this movie great. It features a Zombie-Shark brawl, a Brooklyn Bridge Zombie Takeover, Gorged Eyes and a lovely musical score. Trust me, this movie far outdoes Romero's Dawn or Day and it won't put you to sleep. If you have a strong stomach and like the undead check it out!"
4,"""Zombie"" a sequal to ""Dawn Of The Dead?""","In Italy the name of ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is Zombie, but this film in Italy is called Zombie 2, because it claims to be a sequal to ""Dawn Of The Dead."" It is just as good as ""Dawn Of The Dead"", and the characters are likable, and the zombies are awesomely designed."
4,Only serious gore hounds need apply,"Ok, I know we don't watch these flicks for a cohesive plot or believable acting, but this one is particularly weak in both categories. The gore, however, is way cool (even though it seems like an eternity until it finally gets started). The zombies feasting on that mutilated body is a stomach-turner, for sure. And this is only one in a series of grotesque treats awaiting any serious gore hound. So on those merits alone, I think it earns its four stars. And while the lame plot and even lamer acting prevent me from tacking on that last star, this is truly a must-see for anyone with a taste for onscreen blood and guts."
4,Effective Movie,"For people that say that this movie was a rip-off of Dawn of the Dead are hugely mistaken. This is not the best zombie movie in the world, but it is effective. Of course there are some loopholes in the plot (very obvious in alot of Italian horror movies), but it is very suspenseful. You ask why I gave this film 4 stars? Well, the plot full of loopholes is one and plus the lack of extras for this film. The commentary is OK and the trailers and commercial ads are OK too, but there should have been alot of more extras to go with this movie. If you want see another Fulci movie, check out The Beyond (which I wrote a review on also). This doesn't top the Beyond, but it is a very effective zombie movie."
5,Best of the Spaghetti Zombie flicks,"If you&#65533;re a hard-core Horror fan you know, love and have seen Fulci's classic Zombie. Like almost all Italian flicks it's hard to watch, makes little or know since. No real plot, cheese for production values. Of course for the real fans of this genre/sub genre none of that matters (give us gore, then more gore) if your not a true fan you should not be watching an Italian horror flick anyway, let alone one with a title like Zombie! Anyway plenty of gore here, not much else, so eat a big pasta meal with lots of meat sauce, pop this baby in the DVD player and enjoy!!!!"
4,ZOMBIE...YUM YUM!!,"This is actually a pretty good zombie movie, just make sure you have already eaten before you see it, or that you won't be eating for awhile after viewing it! Effects are pretty decent, and it is kind of difficult to watch the eye impaling scene without turning away, or watching between squinted eyelids! A must have for any gorehound! ENJOY!!"
3,"Lively action, Dead acting","I love the concept of this movie, and I also enjoyed the cinematography (very artistic). However, there were too many things working against this movie. The voice-overs were sometimes worse than a kung fu flick. The lines and acting were cliche, save the professor, whose acting I think saved the movie. And the explantion for the zombies was vague. Then again, looking back, this movie was really about grossing you out with cool special effects. I do think that in that respect it passed."
3,WARNING,"This is the anchorbay release, which is cut. Get the Blue underground release or the media-blasters release. Three stars for being cut. But five stars otherwise."
2,Not interesting,"I watched the beginning and literally fell asleep....it was boring...wasted money , never mind that it was old...it was just old and slow starting.."
2,"Great effects, horrible movie!","Don't get me wrong, i love zombie movies, and i am not to harsh on the acting, however, in Zombie, it is terrible. The effects are incredibly gruesome and awesome. Here are some highlights: the splinter/eye scene, the shark attack, the slow-motion tracheotomy, and zombies feasting on a dismembered body. Asided from the bueatifully awful effects this movie [stinks]...!!! I fast forwarded thru most of the movie."
2,BUYER BEWARE - DEFECTIVE DVD MASTERING HERE!!!,"Firstly the movie's great, blah, blah.But, like other reviews have stated here. The 25th aniversary disc is DEFECTIVE. The DVD will freeze/skip during the doctor's flashback sequence. I went through 2 copies. Both had the exact same problem on several DVD players & computers. This can only mean the discs were poorly mastered.The disc isn't unwatchable, if you are willing to skip forward around 54 minutes and then and rewind back to 55 minutes, not fun. All the extras work fine.(NEW June 2006) The DVD isn't unplayable on newer DVD players. It works on my new Philips DVP3040. Still barfs on just about every other DVD device it try it on."
2,ok here we go...,"i know how everyone says it is a great movie but i'm sorry it made me very bored it takes a very long time for the ""zombie"" action"" to happen and the dubbing was horrible it was like watching a godzilla movie the zombie on the cover is what made it look so good but it shows him for no more than 1 minute so that made me very dissapointed and it was ok gore but i wasnt very impressed so if you want a good zombie film stick with the originals as in night of the living dead those are far more entertaining"
3,Interesting Zombie Film,"The actors do not help the film, but the plot is superior and direction adequate. Some of the gore is frankly unnecessary, specially the famous ""eye splinter"" scene. Some critics have dismissed it as as imitation of ""Dawn of the Dead"", but it seems to me that actually ""Return of the Living Dead"" is an imitation of ""Zombie"". The main ""innovation"" of ""Return"", the explicit decay of the corpses of zombies, can be seen previously here."
3,"Good Idea ,but not very good realization","I've saw this movie,because in the net in all website ,everybody raise this movie like this: ""the woodsplinter in the eye scene is awesome!"".Then i realise that Zombie is not a ""bad movie"", just another zombie flick with another average story.Too much dialouge ,ultra bad actors(in all Italian Horror),violent effects like :woodsplinter in eye,throat bite for twice,and so so so much very discusting zombie!That is Lucio fulci's Zombie!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"After reading several reviews I was really looking forward to this movie. statements like ""AS GORY AS THE LAW ALLOWS"" and ""UNOFFICIAL SEQUEL TO DAWN OF THE DEAD"" are totally ludicris. any of the ""SAW"" movies or ""HOSTEL"" put this movie to shame. the few scenes with any kind of gore were very amatuer at best.hey, if you can grab this movie for under a buck, go for it, otherwise stay away!!!"
1,The worst Anchor Bay DVD I've seen,"Zombie is a fun movie. It's not very good, but it is entertaining.This DVD is dreadful. The video is OK: non-anamorphic and a bit muddy, but reasonably clear most of the time and at least it's the original aspect ratio. The audio is tinny and hollow, sounding like those old badly mastered ""bathroom acoustic"" LPs where mono albums were turned into stereo.The trailers etc are good to have, but the commentary by the lead actor (who's never seen the movie before) and a magazine editor is boring when it's there - and usually is silent.There isn't even time code information to tell you how far into the movie you are, and there's no chapter display. Also the chapters listed on the box and the DVD menu do not correspond to the chapters on the disc.The Beyond dvd was excellent. This is shoddy rubbish. Save your money."
1,Borefest not gorefest,"Pop quiz: You and a couple friends are trying to escape a zombie attack. Your friend sees his wife now a zombie and is stunned and unable to defend himself. Do you1. Immediately attack the zombie and save your friend.2. Run away3. Stand there and stare as the zombie attacks your friend then kill itIf you say 3, then you understand the total idiocy of this movie. Is it gory? Yes. Is it pointless , poorly written and totally stupid? Hell yes. Is it worth enduring another 92 minutes of my life watching again? I would rather watch clothes drying then this garbage again.Check out the HDTV commercial where they actually show the Zombie attacking a shark, it's the best 10 seconds of the movie and will save you the other 91 minutes and 50 seconds of this movie"
1,Crappy zombie movies that are just rip offs,I rented Zombie because I heard good things about it online. The movie is about a zombie attack on a small Caribbean island. The movie slowly trugded on. Most of the movie was just a bunch of stupid story plots ripped off from Geroge Romero. Only two parts held my interest the wooden splitter part and the shark and zombie show down which was cut short. This lowbuget wannabe zombie movie just doesn't cut it. If your looking for a good horror movie to watch with friends look some place else.
3,Among Fulci's best (though that doesn't say a lot),"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci (as my header suggests) but his 1979 film ""Zombie"" is watchable, if silly. I truly remember the ads in the paper for this one proclaiming ""WE ARE GOING TO EAT YOU!"" If you want to see an intelligent zombie movie with social commentary, get Romero's Dead movies. But if it's blood-'n-guts you want, leave your brain at the door and get Zombie. It's poorly plotted and silly but the zombies definitely look more rotted and disoriented in this film than Romero's, and the gore overall looks more realistic. The DVD commentary by star Ian McCulloch isn't that great (although informative) but some scenes are very inventive (the eye-piercing scene, and the shark vs. zombie scene!). If you like zombie movies plotless and bloody (you know who you are) this could very well be the best. Pretty entertaining."
5,Let the dead rise,Slow to start but once the dead rise they refuse to go down. A great flick for fans of the undead.
3,a mediocre B-Movie,"This movie isn't horrible, but it isn't exactly good, either. It's been a while since my freind and I rented this film, but we've been making fun of it ever since. From the begining scene in the morgue where, over a police officer with a torn out throat, one doctor asks the other, ""What do you think the cause of death was?"" to the final standoff where they have made an unlimited supply of molitov coctails from a few whiskey bottles. The scene where one of the male characters takes a canoe paddle and smacks it against the wall causing the zombies to back off will forever live on in my Greatest B-Movie Moments Catalogue. This loses two stars for a couple scenes that were even too hoaky for a B-Movie which you will recognize once you see it. All in all, if you're a B-Movie fan, go for it, otherwise stay very far away."
2,"Nowhere near the greatness of Romero,s classics.","I was interested in seeing this film after reading numerous reveiws about it on the internet.Some going as far as saying it was the best Zombie film of all time.So i rented it expecting alot.To say i was disappointed would be an understatement.Where to start,first the dubbing,it was horrible and really bought the film down.Second it had to many spots in the movie where nothing happened and where flat out boring.This bothered me alot.It has good points,the zombie makeup are very good,better then dawn of the dead,but a nocth below day of the dead.Thats about all the good points,it just wasnt scary,it didnt give me that terryfing feeling that Dawn or Day gave me.If you already have seen the Romero classics then give this one a try.Just dont expect much."
1,Most DVD's skip.,"My DVD skips about 29 into the movie. Tried numerous Bluray and DVD player, my Mac DVD player, it skipped on all of them. Amazon knows there's problems because the customer service rep said there was a note on the item if it gets returned to ask where the movie skips and more info. She said that usually means Amazon is about to take them off their site so people don't order defective products. I got the refund and paid a bit extra for the new Bluray version of this movie made by a different company."
3,Great Movie Awful DVD Experience,I watched this movie & Loved it. The problem with it (reason it is getting a 3) is that my copies kept stopping in the middle of the movie (Scene where Doctor talks to man in hospital). The movie would completely shut off during that part. I went through literally 10 copies & they all did the same thing on high quality DVD Players. Also the commentary volume is very odd with it going from loud to low. Anyone else have this happen? Maybe it was just a terrible pressing.
3,It's Ok but don't buy this edition any more...,"He can't put a coherent sequence together but he sure knows how to pour on the gore.Skip this version and instead purchase Blue Underground's new release or Shriek Show's 2 disc Special Edition with a doco about the making of the film (if you can be bothered learning about it.)I like a lot of Fulci's stuff, but for probably all the wrong reasons. He's a pretty bad director when all is said and done. Others can try to argue that fact but they're clearly only getting off on the gore quotiant in his movies. You certainly don't seek out a Fulci flick for the brilliant performances or master craftsmanship of his editing/pacing and camera work."
2,Avoid Like the Plague,"This movie is boring. If it is slow to build suspense it failes miserably. I can't believe I bought this bomb. The only remotely interesting part is the end where the zombies take over New York City and that is such a relief because it signifies the end of this stinker. The gross parts were gross -- I got to give it that, but there just wasn't enough of them. Take a caffeine pill before you watch this movie to help you stay awake."
1,This movie made me laugh.,I am a young teen girl and I found this movie histerical. The effects were horrible. I was flabergasted at the women taking their tops off for no reason. I don't think that added to the film. The underwater Zombie vs. shark scene wasn't what it was made out to be.. it was about 1 minute long and it was so fake. The zombie's BRIGHT green blood ruined it. This film was a discrace to all Zombie films - if you want to see a great zombie movie see Dawn of the Dead or day of the Dead.. thank you.
1,A classic this is not,"A bought this expecting a good zombie movie (apparently this is in the top 10) and what I got was a very campy(not in the good way) and overrated piece of crap. Not only that the picture and the audio on this dvd is horrendus very poor quality colors are very washed out and blurry specially in the night scenes.The audio is just as bad and the lip sync is laughable it is like 4th graders did this movie. I will give some credit in the gore department but I bought this expecting a GOOD ZOMBIE movie not for gore. I am sorry if I am offending anyone but if you want to see a good zombie movie go see Dawn of the dead(1976) not only is that the best zombie movie but when compared to zombie,zombie is nothing but a pile of crap very overrated and not worth the 13$ one of the best lol one of the worst."
5,The Best,"I love all of Romero's dead movies but for me Lucio Fulci's Zombie is the best!!!!! The zombies are scary looking. The grave yard zombie that bites Auretta Gay's throat is the perfect zombie: Worms, decay. ugly teeth. A very handsome fellow. The theme music that plays everytime before the zombies appear is spooky. I like it. Auretta Gay looks VERY NICE scuba diving. Olga Karlatos is very good looking and REALLY looks good in the shower. One of the most blackboard scratching feelings happens when a zombie kills Olga Karlatos by pulling her face through a busted up splintered door. Tisa Farrow is good looking. It doesn't have a whole lot of gore as compared to Romero films but still I never get tired of watching it. In my top 10 movies of all time."
1,Easily the worst movie I have ever seen,"Poor acting may be excused, as may a boring story, but the absolutely only upside to this movie is a scene where a woman get a splinter driven through her eye. Groce? Absolutely, but it looked cool. Apart from that, there are few fighting scenes, a notable exception being a scene with a zombie fighting a shark that is VERY obviously a doll. Some poor movies may be seen because it is fun to see how badly it is made. This movie is beyond bad. It is boring and uninteresting."
1,Don't they ever learn,"How many shots does it take before you learn you have to shoot them in the head?Lesson to be learned from this movie: When you throw a molatov cocktail, make sure you do it from outside the house!"
4,Excellent! A MUST BUY,This was such a great Zombi movie. Considering the year this movie came out...the special effects were outstanding! The bonus DVD was very informative and worth while.
3,Mixed feelings about this movie.,"Is this a great zombie movie? Yes! Are the special effects any good? Yes! Is the plot decent? Yes! My only complaint about this movie is that it is badly dubbed. This is an Italian film that is dubbed in English, and the dubbing gets pretty bad at times. So much that it's distracting from the rest of the movie. I've seen this DVD at several stores for about $, so at that price, get it. If you don't mind the dubbing, you'll love this movie!"
3,Is it over yet?,"Let me make it clear that I truly believe Fulci was a master of visual effects and creating atmosphere... however, none of this expertise translated over to pacing. Zombie plods along, dragging out potentially perfunct scenes into drawn out yawnfests.Don't get me wrong, the zombies and gore look incredible. And of course, a certain eye gouging scene is immaculate. Also, the plot and acting are solid enough... just not solid enough to make this movie interesting. Plus, a horrible soundtrack doesn't exactly help.I never understood the hype around Zombie.... in my opinion, Gates of Hell is a much better movie, and deserves more of the praise placed on Zombie."
4,Awesome gore,Just a cheap rip off of Dawn of the Dead. But so what its still pretty cool anyway. The story is set on a tropical island where voodoism raises the dead back to life. But i must say the script and acting were not great. Definitely not as cool as the masterpice The Beyond was(which i give 5 stars) but still pretty good italian flick. AWESOME GORE FULCI LIVES
5,Finally A Low Carb Book that uses Splenda...,"I was searching for a Low Carb Cook Book that only uses Splenda. I came across this one and just had to have it.I couldn't believe it. I found every ingedient at my Local Albertsons and for the first time I didn't have to ORDER anything. My sister and I are both on Atkins and we are so happy now. We made the FLAN and then MADE the Cheesecake. Both turned out great and let's just say WE ATE LIKE PIGS and didn't have any guilt afterwards. There was poem inthe back called IN GODS EYES WERE ALL CLEAR. That poem really hit home. THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK if you want to eat Desserts again. This holiday it's going to be so much better now since there is a ""PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE RECIPE that only has 4 NET CARBS and YIPPY it's SPLENDAAAAAAMy sister and I are so happy that we made this purchase."
2,Net Carbs Are Incorrect,"While the recipes in this book are delicious, the net carb counts are completely incorrect. It seems the author does not count granular Splenda as the 24 carbs per cup that it is. Good recipes, but do your own math when figuring net carbs."
4,"Low Carb Sinfully Delicious Desserts: Cheesecakes, Pies< Cookies,Mousse,Tiramisu, Fudge, Chocolate, and More","This is a cool cookbook! Things I thought I couldn't have I now can. And made with everyday products. Even my husband, who is not on low carbs, enjoys these desserts.Thank you for a great cookbook."
4,Summaries of ten recent Presidents.,"This is a composite book from ten different authors about ten different Presidents. Since these are all well known authors, the writers know their subjects and boil their personalities down in twenty to thirty pages. One cannot get more well known than David McCullough and Steven Ambrose. The writing is great and flows well.If I have any problem, it is that some of the authors are more generous than others. Reeves makes Kennedy look pretty low on the morality issue and Noonan inflates Reagan a little too much. Of course, this is subjective writing, and since the authors know their subjects well, one can probably count on some bias. All in all a great read on some of our more recent Presidents, with the exception of Clinton and Bush II."
4,A Nice Collection of Essays,"This was a nice collection of essays on several of our past Presidents. Some of it was expected based on what I knew about some of these presidents. However, there were some interesting insights, and I learned a few things I did not previously know about one or two of the presidents. It is a relatively short collection of essays, and didn't take too long to read. I found it to be well worth reading."
4,"FOREVER,S A LONG TIME",THE ALBUM IS EXCELLENT ESPECIALLY THE TRACK I'M SO TIRED OF IT ALL BY MERLE HAGGARD. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS THAT HE HAS EVER RECORDED.
2,What a waste!,"I thought that product would be good to use, it lasted two weeks and stop working, The sleeve does nothing for you. Maybe I could use it as a bone and give it to the dog instead."
2,no good for do it yourselfers,"I bought this ish so I could develop it in my darkroom on my own, but then i found out you aren't supposed to process it in B/W chemicals. So it was useless.Amazon doesn't tell you this, but it says on the box: ""Do not process in Black & White chemicals. Ask for regular color processing.""Just FYI-ing yall.as for the quality, my prints looked pretty good after i took them to a commercial developer."
2,"""New-fangled"" black and white","As the first reviewer noted, this is not ""traditional"" black and white film. This is for the consumer market so it can be easily developed on color processing equipment. Have tried a few rolls and the whites come out off-white and contrast is low. Well-processed traditional B&W prints will last 100+ years. No way to know how prints from this film will look in a few decades. If you are taking family photos, go to the expense and trouble of buying regular Kodak B&W film and have it professionally processed. Your great-great-grandchildren will thank you."
2,"Slow, boring","This movie was very boring, even to my 8 year old daughter. Don't waste your time or money, unless you just like to watch puppies."
2,The Retrievers,I still have not recieved the item-is has been 4 weeksThey did inform me the original shipment was damaged and it has reshipped
4,cute kids movie,"bought for my 6 yr old son, he seemed to like it and the price wasnt too bad either. The s&h kills you on anything you buy from the amazon sight, unless your a prime member and you get lucky enough to find it on prime- which I wasnt. The price of the movie was ok, the movie was in good condition, but the shipping and hand. charges kind of made it not worth it for me. If my son hadnt wanted to see it so bad, Id not have bought it."
2,Funny taste,"I can't eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them. My kids also think they taste funny. My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own!"
4,Small size gets high marks,"This fit-in-your-pocket phrase book is nicely designed, and I really use it.The grammar section alone outperforms bigger Behasa Indonesia language courses for simplicity and clear explanations.Categories like ""Getting Around"" and ""Food"" are well organized, and it really is possible to find what phrase you are looking for, standing at the market in front of Mister Banana Seller, in a few seconds. Glossary is English to Behasa Indonesia only (and not the other way around)."
4,Selamat makan.,Selamat siang. Saya hanya tahu sedikit bahasa Indonesia. Dimana setasiun kereta api? Bagaimana jika kita makan pagi di warung ini? Saya mau beli kelambu. Terima kasih.
1,Was this book even in print?,"Why don't the publishers just put the solutions in the text book? As anyone should know, once you know the solutions to any logic or math text, you realize how easy it all is. Could there be an agenda by the Ivy League establishment to incorporate a monopoly of know-how in intelligence? Are they afraid of everyone scoring one hundred percent on exam day? If so, there would be no curve. If so, there would be no disparity between A's credentials versus B's credentials. How does this propel society to intellectual advancement?"
3,Just a Basic Camera.,"The actual pictures produced with this camera look fine. There is nothing special about the photo quality, and certainly nothing special about the camera itself. You have to advance the film manually. And besides a lens, viewfinder, and flash, there aren't any special features. But if you just want a cheap, basic camera, this one is a good one to go with."
2,Walden Pond: a HISTORY???,I'd been looking forward to this book with great anticipation. I expected to find a detailed history of Thoreau's famous pond but instead found more gossipy stories than serious history. Thoreau deserved better. I hope Walden gets a serious history in the future.
5,excellent history,"Walden Pond by W. Barksdale Maynard is an excellent history, thoroughly researched and written in the best prose style."
1,A Complete Waste of Money - Do Not Buy!,"Buyer beware! Do not buy this DVD, as some players won't even play the sound. If you do get the sound to work, it will play at twice the correct speed, and it's like watching it FF (fast forward) with the sound on. In other words, you'll hear the Concerto being played twice as fast. I cannot understand how EMI could even put this on the market."
5,Catholicism From the Inside Out -- Literally!,"Bartholomew F. Brewer, converted, Discalced friar and priest, details his personal odyssey from the labyrinth that is Catholicism, to the life-changing decision he made to follow Christ and His teachings according to His Holy Word, and not the words of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Anyone in doubt about the Catholic religion needs to read this book. It will open the eyes of anyone truly seeking the truth."
3,Kindle version a little hard to read,"Trojan Women is a classic on the aftermath of war. What happens to the women of the losing side? Mostly told through the eyes of Hecuba the wife of Priam, we find out the destinations of the rest of the women and the child of Hector.This was tranlsated into rhyming stanzas, unfortunately in the Kindle version they all run together so there's no rhythm to reading it, capital letters that signify the beginning of a new line is thrown in the middle and it's a little confusing."
1,"Worst and most unfair, frustrating game.",I was so surprised to see this game have such a high rating. This game is boring and EXTREMELY unfair. It gives the enemy all of the moves to where it makes it unbearable and frustrating to play. It made me break my ds because i got so frustrated and threw it at the wall. I really really do NOT reccomend this game to ANYONE!!
5,Simply Great!!,"I'm not a super big jazz fan but, it's good to have a few jazz albums in ones music collection. Sorting through the usuals as Coultrane and Davis, Hancock ect..... I spotted the Bill Evans section. I stared at it vaguely recognizing the name and on a whim picked this up as a curiosity. WOW!!! What a great find! This cd says it's the best of the verve live series box set which contains 18 cd's!! Whoever went to the trouble of narrowing it down to just one 61 min cd did a great job! Now I just need to save up some pennies to get that mammoth box set cause once you have a taste of this you just have to go back for another bite!!"
5,"Useful, To the Point","This is a very useful, to the point description of how an organization can realistically use the Baldridge criteria for improvement. The internal assessment section and appendix is especially useful."
1,Fluff,"I looked at this book in the library (glad I didn't spend the money on it!) and learned little from it. It is full of non-specifics, and provides little in the realm of useful info. Why the publisher thought this was worthy of a book is beyond me. It looks as if the author had to pad the book in order to make it lengthy---and this padding is clearly evident. If you want to learn how to implement Baldrige, there are a TON of other books available (most FREE) that can help you do it. Save the money you would have spent on this, and take your kids out for ice cream. You'll end up with a wiser investment."
4,"Great Information, But Not Easily Absorbed","I think it's very important to be an alert defensive driver, and I'm trying really hard to make this clear to my kids. I bought the book, Professional Driving Techniques: The Essential Guide to Operating a Motor Vehicle with Confidence and Skill with this in mind. It's actually a great book that covers a lot of ""what if's,"" but the problem is that since my kids haven't encountered any of the situations discussed, they really don't understand the importance of the information, and they certainly weren't absorbing it. On the other hand, I also bought SimuRide Home Edition for the PC, a driving simulator for beginners. This is more than just a video game; it is a realistic driver's education tool that puts the ""driver"" into real life scenarios so he or she can practice their skills in a safe environment."
5,Green/Gold Stuffed Dragon,"This dragon is beautiful, the right size and very soft. The green/gold color is beautiful. Great item for our dragon collection. This is also a wonderful gift for a child that doesn't chew on toys anymore. Great to sleep with. I would order it again from the seller."
2,Be Careful You Know What You Are Getting,"The music is good (as you would expect), however be very careful. There are 24 tracks on this CD, but there are really only six pieces. Tracks 7-24 are alternate recordings and outtakes of the first six. If this is what you want, fine. But if you are expecting a CD with 24 different songs, this isn't it."
4,Bop masters getting together,"Though the title credits Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, bop pioneer Thelonious Monk is also on this date, bringing three bop masters together. Add drummer Budy Rich who, though out of his natural element, plays exceedingly well, and you have a cooking set of bop tunes. The only problem I have with this CD reissue is the extensive number of false starts tacked on to the end of the disc. Though jazz hounds might find this fascinating, they take away from the magical music that preceeded them. My advice is to stop your disc player after track 13, or better still, seek out the original CD which contained only the first 13 tracks."
3,great music but the same songs over and over,"You would think that any album that has Bird, Diz, Monk, and Buddy Rich would be fantastic to listen to. This one is, but there are only six different songs on it, and then out-takes and variations of those same songs. So in that sense, it was a bit disappointing. If all of the songs were different, then this would get five stars instead of three........"
4,High School Summer Reading,"In 10th grade I had to read two books for Global studies and one book for english. For one of my Global books I picked ""Too Late The Phalarope"". It was a good book, so good in fact that I read it in one day during a car trip. I found the book to be a bit confusing because of the writing style but the plot of the story is what kept me reading. I enjoyed the book so much I will not mind having to go through it a second time so I can take notes on it! This is one book I will look forward to reading again, even if it is just to take notes!"
2,"Energy some, weight loss? UNLIKELY. Taste = BEYOND NASTY","First off I ACCIDENTALLY ordered this instead of the pills from redline ... it arrived in a busted up container but with the bottle still mercifully sealed so I decided to give it a try. If you were ever fed castor oil or any really disgusting medicine as a kid, THIS stuff puts those memories to shame. It was very difficult to force myself to swallow the half dose I started with (from experience I know to start with half or LESS of any diet supplement because I am very sensitive to their contents and have actually stayed up 24 hours straight and cleaned the house at warp speed) and to be honest I didn't feel anything much other than a little ""loopy"" or airheaded/forgetful/oblivious in an upbeat way... NOT a good thing for any working adult. It may work well for others, it didn't for me, and the taste was enough to have me send it back. GROSS doesn't begin to cover it!"
2,Energy -- But Tastes Awful,"If you want a burst of energy, this will definitely do the trick. However, the taste is horrible. I have an extremely strong stomach, but two of the four times I did take it, I was nauseous. The nausea wasn't worth the energy for me."
5,Great,"I had tried the redline drinks, the pills, and now the liquid form, i love it. it works great. it helped me lose 14lbs."
5,"Well Done, Ms. Leppard!","Mandie's mother is adamant that she is sent to a girl's school in Asheville, and Mandie doesn't want to go. But to please her mother she packs her bags will a sigh and heads for the city.Mandie hates it there. It's a prissy school, and they have to do stupid stuff like balancing a book on their head.But there is puzzling things too, such as the mysterious noises in the attic. Mandie and her new friend Celia are determined to find out. But will they?As soon as I had started reading this book I could not put it down. It was so interesting. I'm glad Mandie found a friend there, a girl who could help keep her in track. And boo to April Snow! She is just as cold and haughty as April snow. Her mother must have known what she was doing when she named that brat!I liked the part about Helen. It made me sad that someone would neglect the poor girl like that. I'm glad that she found a good place to stay after that.If you read this book, you won't be sorry. It is really good!"
4,Mandie and the Forbidden Attic,"This was the second mandie book that I read. It was really exciting! I couldn't put it down! Mandies personality is very realistic, unlike some other books that I have read in the past. I just went to the library and checked out 29 Mandie books because I like them so much. :)"
2,Not built to last,"I paid almost $90 for this charger at Radio Shack because I was in dire need. I bought it in March or April of 2009. Yesterday, 07.28.10, it died on me. There is a blue light that comes on when the charger is plugged into the outlet. Even though the charger remained in the outlet, the blue light faded after less than 3 minutes. There was no power/""juice"" being sent to my laptop. I tried several outlets; I also tried using the car charger that came in the set. The same thing occurred; the blue light faded after less than 3 minutes. Also, I found that the iGo did not ""charge"" my computer's battery. Once I disconnected the iGo charger, my battery would last about 5 minutes and then my computer would shut down."
1,Product will die within a year or so,"I have owned two of this company's (iGo) chargers and both have died within about a year. Specifically, the charger will simply stop charging. When plugged in the blue light on the charger will come on and then immediately fade. The company was great about honoring the two-year warranty on the first charger, but the replacement died a year later. Unfortunately their warrant is from the date of the initial purchase, so if the replacement dies and the two years from initial purchase have passed you are out of luck. I don't know about you, but that simply doesn't sit well with me. If you warranty your product for two years, then the clock should start again when the product is replaced.Seriously consider purchasing a universal charger manufactured by a different company."
3,So far so good,"So far so good, I haven't been having any problems with it quite yet. That's why I only give it a 3 -- I'm not sure how it'll last. I've had it for a few weeks now, so I'll update when/if something happens."
3,Good news & bad news,"The unit was a godsend when I needed it, and it worked great, however, as one other reviewer pointed out, the cords very easily pull out of the power unit, so you have to be careful how you position it to keep it from disconnecting. That got to be a real pain after while. You'd think it was charging, but it wasn't. Mine never quit working, though, as some reviewers have complained."
3,An inaccuracy?,"Just a comment, with the song ""Buckeye Victory March"" it's actually the University's alma mater, ""Carmen Ohio"". Just something I noticed when looking at this item, and for clarificational purposes."
4,Great shortbread pan!,this is a very nice shortbread pan with a cute snowflake design. easy care & clean up. adds a nice decorative touch to your baking.
5,Pretty Snowflakes with Little Work,"A lovely pan, priced less than in specialty baking catalogs. The snowflakes are imprinted on shortbread clearly, and can work for both Christmas and post-Christmas winter baking. Great if you like impressive-looking treats but don't have the patience to work a pastry bag full of icing."
5,"Easy to use, great results.","The pattern came out great the first time I used the pan. I agree with another reviewer, use the recipe from the King Arthur Flour people, or if you are recipe challenged, buy a box of their shortbread mix. It makes two pans full. Cleanup is very easy also."
4,Love this shortbread pan,This festive faith-neutral design makes beautiful cookies all winter long. Glad I finally added it to my plethora of baking pans.
5,makes great cookies,All of my cookies had great snowflake details on them...I did not use the recipe that came with the pan. I used a recipe from the McCormick website...seen it on Martha Stewart as well...I made honey and lavender shortbread...they look wonderful and taste wonderful...this is a great pan
1,Tinkyada usually the best-try a different noodle than spirals,There is no other rice noodle brand that holds up to cooking without mushing and can replace wheat noodles without complaint. Spirals however have a problem in that their centers need more cooking than the rest so to get them cooked well they do become overcooked. Try fusili instead-they are AWESOME!
3,Okay pasta,"I know we are in the minority on this one! We have not tried a large variety of gluten free pasta brands so I do not have a huge reference point. Our first pasta brand was Sam's Mills corn pasta and it is still our favorite. I find no matter which method I use to cook the Tinkyada pasta it comes out mushy, and it does not present very nicely as leftovers or in a baked dish. It breaks up and falls apart. However, the taste is fine and due to price and availability we continue using it."
5,Tinkyada Brown Rice Spiral pasta,"Wonderful product. My child is allergic to gluten and Tinkyada's rice pasta is the best option for us. It is affordable, and it tastes great! Our family loves all of Tinkyada's rice pasta products!"
5,Best GF pasta brand,"I have been using Tinkyada pasta exclusively for a few years. I have used this pasta in dishes I made to share at work, at parties, and at family functions. No one knows the difference until they see me eating it (then they know it has to be GF).It isn't just the taste, but the texture that will fool anyone. Tinkyada pastas hold their texture very well. In my experience, they are as hard to cook to a mush as durham wheat pasta, and maintain their quality through refrigeration and reheating. Every other brand of rice pasta, quinoa pasta, and corn pasta I have tried have a horrible mushy texture and over-cook way too easy.Makes great cooked pasta dishes and cold pasta salads, too.I have never had any problem with the quality of this product, whether buying it at a store or online. I have never had any problems with shipping, and never a need to contact customer service."
2,Not my favorite Tinkyada product,"I love Tinkyada and order it through Amazon regularly to feed my family of 7. However, the spirals are awful and I will never order them again. They just plain fall apart, no matter how they are cooked. By the time they are on your plate, you're going to have little spiral edges all separated from the main piece. They are also very hard to get on a fork. This is my second time ordering spirals and I'm done with them. Im going to stick with the other varieties."
4,Too Delicate for shipping?,"I ordered a box of this spiral pasta, as well as a box of regular spaghetti noodles, and though it is VERY tasty for a gluten free pasta, my bags of spiral pasta each came with a quarter to half cup of JUST of broken shards of pasta, and the spirals that did stay in shape were ""fractured"" and many pieces break during cooking. The spaghetti noodles seemed to come in OK. Would buy this brand again, but maybe stick with less delicate shaped pasta that withstand shipping a little better.... Or recommend better packaging to prevent breakage. Anyone else have this problem with the spirals?"
4,Best chord book I've found,"The Progressive guitar instruction series is excellent. I've studied the lead guitar and lead guitar riffs books, and I recently bought the slide guitar book.The best thing about the chord book is the organization by key. The book provides all chords for each key, in standard and bar chord configurations. The book also contains a nice, brief description of music theory and examples of some typical chord progressions. It's far better, and more comprehensive, than any other chord book I've seen (and as a result, of course, it won't fit in your case)."
5,Ladder 49,"Baltimore firefighter Jack Morrison, making the transition from inexperienced rookie to seasoned veteran, struggles to cope with a risky, demanding job that often shortchanges his wife and kids. He relies on the support of his mentor and captain, Mike Kennedy and his second family--found in the brotherly bond between the men of the firehouse. But when Jack becomes trapped in the worst blaze of his career, his life and the things he holds important--family, dignity, courage--come into focus. As his fellow firemen of Ladder 49 do all they can to rescue him, Jack's life hangs in the balance. This movie is both an exciting and formula-breaking action-adventure and as an enjoyably sappy tearjerker."
3,"Smoke, but not much fire","Firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) lies injured in a burning factory after rescuing an injured man. While his friends and co-workers battle to save his life, we are treated to flashbacks detailing his career, courtship and marriage. The structure is cliché and, unfortunately, the content doesn't do enough to redeem it. Lots of fine actors do good work, but they just don't have much to work with. This film is clearly intended as a tribute to firemen, which is a laudable goal, but I didn't feel that it added anything to my understanding of their lives and work. A pleasant entertainment if you're not too demanding."
5,Sincere,"An above average, bring the whole family, feel good about guys and girls who risk their lives, movie. Phoenix does an above average job as Jack, a rookie fireman in Baltimore. His girfriend, wife and mother of his kids is underplayed and I thought that Jacinda Barrett could have been given more to work with. Yet this is a post 911 paean to those men and women who rush into burning buildings to save our butts and in that regard, not much else is needed.Travolta does an as usual excellent job, knowing his place. Like Gere in 'Unfaithful' the story is not about him and he never oversteps his bounds. He's like an ancient soothsayer, making sense of all the chaos.I especially like the ""For the Love of The Game"" style of telling a present tense story with fairly (when done well) seamless flashbacks. You'll shed a few tears but you won't be disappointed. You can bring the kids. They'll love the goose scene. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"
4,Good Entertainment,"My wife and I went to see ""Ladder 49"" expecting another ""Backdraft"". ""Ladder 49"" makes that movie look like a cartoon. Most things rang true. When Phoenix's character fights his first fire it was just like what all firefighters experience. As a firefighter I noticed a few technical errors but I'm sure they happened to make the movie flow a little easier. Nothing major, like where they parked one of the engines was bit too close to the fire, and I was taught to never give your breathing apparatus to a victim (they may fight you to keep it). But, basically it was very entertaining and most of it, like I said, had the ring of truth."
4,Who do we love? Fireman!,"A simple story of the life of a good guy, Jack, living his dream of being a firefighter. He's brave, but takes risks & is in real danger as the movie flashes back to the beginning of his career. He bonds with his mentor, boss & friend played with dignity & humor by John Travolta. He meets his future wife, who can not only drink with the boys but is a beautiful sexy & really loves him & they have a family. But fireman have their demons too. One of them is the danger of their job they face every day. He risks his life saving others & his best friend dies in the line of duty.Not a lot of surprises in this simply good but sad movie. It is PG-13 but as a father, it's an good old-fashioned type movie with great action scenes to see with your kids."
3,LADDER 49 Overextends,"Depending on what you are looking for in LADDER 49 will make a huge difference on what you get out of it. Promotionally, LADDER 49 is billed as an action/comedy. However, the real story lies in the love life of one of the firemen - and it's NOT John Travolta. In fact, Mr. Travolta is much more of a supporting player than the lead. The film does deliver in its imagery and dramatic storytelling. The fire sequences are incredible and you definitely feel a connection with what real firefighters and their families face on a daily basis. If you are in the movie for a well-told emotional drama, then by all means, pick up LADDER 49."
4,Great Story of the Life of a Firefighter,"I wasn't sure I would at first, but I really enjoyed this movie. The film is seen as flashbacks through the eyes of a firefighter, trapped in a burning building, waiting to be rescued. It starts with his first day as a rookie, as he endures hazings and practical jokes from the veterans. From this point, we follow along as he learns his job, meets his wife, starts a family, and endures both tragedy and triumph as a member of the ""busiest firestation in the city"". The firefighting scenes are breathtaking, and keep you engrossed the whole time."
4,Worth Watching!,"I'm a fan of Morris Chestnut, John Travolta and Joaquin Phoenix, so this movie was a must see for that reason. Aside from great actors, this movie has heart and wonderfully moving performances. This movie really makes you think about the real risk fire fighters take daily. These people are true heroes. I loved watching that part of the movie. Joaquin's character, Jack Morris makes the ultimate sacrifice. Really moving scene.We also see how tight knit these guys are and how they keep it light with a dangerous job.As a hopeless romantic, one thing that truly touched me was the adorable shyness of Jack and his romance with the woman he met and soon married, played very well by Jacinda Barrett. His character is the kind of man women fall in love with.Please do yourself a favor, go out and buy this one."
4,Very inspirational movie that shows the life of a fire fighter,"Nobody is perfect, but we all have a heart. If there is anybody that has a big heart, it's your local fire department. See what they go through to save lives while risking theirs in this action packed movie. A must have!"
3,A nice slice of life,Ladder 49 is a touching story about a fire fighter in Maryland. It`s the story of one characters desire to fight fires and help people despite the risk of dying and not being there to help his family. It`s an okay movie. Perhaps good for a date.
1,"Really 1.5 stars, but definitely not 5!","Sure, I want a movie that honors our first responders, but this one definitely isn't it. Instead, it's all the usual blockbuster cliches. The compelling drama is so laughably predictable you yearn for the action scenes, and the action scenes are so boringly predictable you can't wait for the drama to plod back on. If it were a Discovery Channel docudrama detailing the hands-on tactics of these fellows it would've been all right, but the nature of the fires is never explained (as it was in Backdraft, where the fire was an actual character... the villain). Instead, everything just inexplicably blows up, over and over. I guess the explosions looked good in the trailers. Come on, Hollywood... do these guys justice next time."
2,"Eh,...","Will he die...?Flashbacks.This makes up who he is.The Clincher.The end.Special Features: Surprising there's no CG fires.Pheonix is really getting lowered off that building, hm, interesting tidbit.In conclusion: Eh. (Not a jawdropper, folks. Not a recommender, either. However, for a firefighter, probably a decent tribute). Will not bore someone gun-ho to watch it. To the everyday fellow who, when asked if he wants to watch it, goes ""Eh,..."" in favor of a more rolling adventure, you will be left saying ""Eh."" Will not exceed expectations. Will be forgotten if you are not really enthused to watch it.""Eh,..."" says Who. Peace out, and vote if this review is helpful. (Probably won't be to any and will get terribly assaulted with heartfelt ""NO's""! I can take criticism. Can you...?)"
3,JUST ANOTHER BACKDRAFT MOVIE,"IT IS THE SAME TYPE OF MOVIE AS BACKDRAFT. A FIGHT IN THE BAR, A NEW BLOND GIRL FRIEND, SOME FIRE FIGHTER GETS HIS FACE BADLY BURNED, ALL THE SAME STUFF."
5,A classic,"I thought this movie was excellent because it seemed to depict the real life of firefighters and the struggles they have to live with every day. They save the lives of other people and risk their own in the process. I thought John Travolta was excellent as the chief, but Joaquin Phoenix really stood out playing the firefighter Jack Morrison. He made the role and that made the movie more effective and it was a truly emotional film."
5,DVD purchase,Ordered Ladded 49 a few days before Christmas and got it only 2 or 3 days later just in time for a Christmas! Was very satisfied with my purchase!
2,"Poor plot, poorly executed storyline","I didn't feel any sense of brotherhood between these men. And the plot and entire movie just fell flat for me. It was a cliched portrayel of the profession, cliched life of a man (becomes rookie firefighter, marries immediately, has a boy, then a girl, bbq's with other firefighters at his house etc.). Just a boring salute to firefighting.Firefighting gentlemen, deserved BETTER. A better screenplay would have been a good start. A more tragic or moving death would be have been good. One that made me care more than an ounce. You could see this truck coming a mile away."
3,Paint by numbers,A post 9/11 paint by number production meant to remind each of us of the ordinary heroes and angels who walk among us every day. The are no surprises and as far as action--if you've seen one firefighter film you've seen them all. Still the sacrifices these men make everyday should humble us all.
3,Pales,"When I saw previews for this movie, I thought it was going to be a lot like ""Backdraft"". If only. This movie pales by comparison. Too plodding, too shallow (although a lot of time is spent trying to do character development), and too safe. It's like they had nothing else to do, so why not make this movie."
3,Heavy Burden on the Viewer's Emotions,This film captivates you by playing on your emotional response to the story. There are a lot of good characters and interesting sequences switching from the present and then to flashbacks leading the story up to the point of the central catastrophic fire where Joaquin Phoenix is trapped and cutoff from the other fire fighters. His Captain portrayed by John Travolta tries futilely to rescue him keeping in touch over a wireless. Ultimately it is a very depressing film. I don't see the point of it all. This movie has its moments but it is too hard to take.
2,Uncaptivating.,"Ladder 49 had no plot. It's basically a firefighters are heroes propaganda film. Most of the movie is played in flashback mode, which is fine, as long as the flashbacks are showing you how the first showed scene came about - but this movie doesn't. The whole movie is a review of happenings in a firefighter's life that all seem utterly cliche. The only drama comes from the scenes where they're fighting fires, and they didn't create intense enough situations. The fires LOOKED like they were staged on a set. I'm thinking they must have blown their budget on getting Travolta and Jaoquin, who were both surprisingly flat in their acting. This was especially disappointing to me because I felt they both had done great jobs in their last couple of films."
3,Travolta is great. Story is ok,Ladder 49 is an ok movie with a screenplay that is not that compelling.Travolta saves the movie.
2,This coulda been a contender,"This movie starts out gripping and engaging, and ends up sudsing itself down to the level of a Lifetime movie or soap opera. Love Joaquin Phoenix, fabulous actor. John Travolta is not at his best here. Not sure why this didn't gel, but neither my husband nor I would recommend it."
4,Powerful film about everyday lives!,Probably one of the most accuate portrayals of fire fighters and their families in a long time. John Travolta gives a great performance as the fire chief. Joaquin Phoenix is unforgetable as the hero. This is one powerful film. One that will stay with you for some time.
4,Gift for Dad,"Dad loves anything to do with fire fighting, so he should love this video. He actually asked for it for Christmas."
4,"solid film, good dvd release",if your into firefighting im sure youve already seen it if you dont own it there are some cool extra about firefighting. and if not but just into movies if you liked the guardian or backdraft youll like it too.
5,Simply Wonderful!,"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!This movie is suspensful, funny, and touching. The story mainly follows the firefighting career of Jack Morrison (played by Phoenix), and goes back and forth from the present time to long flashbacks, but it's very easy to follow along. I am definitely going to buy this movie when it comes to DVD! Also, if you plan on seeing this, you might want to take a tissue because of some emotional moments."
1,St Louis Cardinals Wireless PS2 Controller,"This item is not a St Louis Cardinals Baseball controller, it is an St Louis Rams Football controller. Very disappointed as we are huge St Louis Cardinals Baseball Fans, however, was not able to give this as a Christmas present to my Son."
3,Waste of a bonus CD,"The nicest aspect of this book is it's accompanied with a 10-song CD, including great tunes such as Sonny Rollins' ""Way Out West"" and Miles Davis' ""Oleo."" But the author doesn't say much about these pieces. I personally would've loved to see some detailed annotaion about the song structure, instruments, melodic development, etc.In fact, Sutro is mostly interested in names. He spends only about 5-10 pages on what constitutes jazz: swing, improv, and so on. This is what I wanted more of. I want to listen to a piece of music and have someone whisper in my ear ""notice the synocpated the beat here."" I also would like a clearer description of the differences between historical periods. How does hard bop differ from bebop? Sutro gives me some names in each group, but he doesn't help me to *hear* the difference. Why not use the bonus CD to help us out here?"
4,A great place to start!,"Jazz is a huge subject and this book doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: an introduction to the players and the musicGood humored enough to avoid ever becoming ""dry and boring"" and the author clearly loves his subjectI'd give this 5 Stars if there was an extra couple of chapters on history or music theory.As it is, solid value for money and a good readGW"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"The title led me to believe there would be more focus on plot, but the author seems apologetic about the plot portion of the book. The first third is devoted to character development, and the entire book is in the form of questions to ask of your work. Not very helpful in my experience."
2,Not worth buying,"This might be a good title to skim if you are looking for ideas but there is very little practical knowledge included. This is especially absurd because we are told that the author has reviewed 50,000 manuscripts. If so, why do we get so little applicable insights from him. And for a guy who has, we are told, reviewed 50,000 manuscripts, the examples he gives are all from...movies! Not books, but films! What a waste."
4,"When the Plot Thickens, the writing improves","Lukeman promises in the introduction that by the end of the book, readers (writers) will take away plenty of new ideas and inspiration. At first I was skeptical, but ultimately he's right. The topics he covers are themselves nothing new, for they are basic fundamentals, but the depth to which Lukeman plunges into each area makes the book an excellent reference. The amount of questions he compels you to ask of your own work is astounding, which leads you to deepen and broaden your writing. If you are well into your own project, it would be wise to stop and explore your work through the exercises he offers at the end of each chapter. The chapters on Characterization are especially good. If you don't have much material written, don't worry... this knowledge can be used going forward, so that you are saved some revising time."
2,Too much of a good thing?,"I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters?"
1,For Beginners Only,"If you have written anything at all, indeed, if you have read anything at all, this book will not make you a better, more knowledgeable fiction writer. The author certainly seems to assume the reader has almost no knowledge of fiction as most of his references are to films. Likewise, his discussions of fictional technique are shallow: in a discussion of the need for a character to change, he offers as an example ""the rebellious son realizes his mother has always been good and kind to him."" He assumes that a reader of fiction won't sit still for an unreliable narrator (and uses as analogy the refusal of a movie viewer to tolerate an out of focus shot).Perhaps if you are absolutely new to fiction writing, the lists of characteristics in the first chapters will assist you. Otherwise, buy James Wood's How Fiction Works instead."
3,Quite Underwhelming.,I found this book too formulaic to be at all useful. If you review the book in the bookstore you will find that in a few minutes you will be able to glean all the useful information from this book.I would recommend checking it out from the library before you make the purchase and decide for yourself.
3,"Good, but not extraordinary","I loved some of the songs, but a bit dissapointed by some others. Since I bought it on a sale, it's worth to listen to. In overall, it's a good album for easy listening..."
5,Outstanding book about a world class cave.,"As a caver, and cave owner, one of my fantasies is to visit Lechuguilla Cave. Since the opportunities to do so are rare, the next best thing is to read this book. It's well-written and a tremendous amount of time and research went into putting the history and stories together. The photos are great too."
1,Rust spots after first wash! Absolute disappointment.,"I purchased this flatware after an exhaustive search for new everyday stainless. Many of the reviews posted referred to the nice weight and simple styling of the design. All true. However, I should have paid more attention to the couple of reviews discussing rust spots. After the very first wash every grooved piece (forks and knives) were covered in ugly orange rust spots. These were washed in a two year old Fisher & Paykel dishwasher with powder detergent arranged as specified in the manufacturer's care instructions. I spent over an hour using stainless polish to try to remove the spots (it is impossible to remove them completely) and then rewashed only to have the exact same result. These went back pronto! It was a real disappointment from a brand like Oneida. It is clear that there was a defect in the manufacturing process."
1,Extreme disappointment,"We received this item for our wedding registry, and we immediately want to return it. The picture may make it look nice, but don't be fooled. The minute we took it out of the box, we wanted to throw it out of the window. This silverware is cheap, machine punched out chinese garbage. The back edge of the handles has a sharp edge and is uneven. It is very overpriced, very misleading, please don't buy this product, you won't be happy."
3,Extremely uninspired,"Had great expectations for this. Alas... Sounds like everyone ""mailed it in."" I like most everything else Bill Laswell has done and, considering the lineup on this cd, expected a funked up bunch of musc. Unfortunatley, the operative word isn't funked but a word that sounds a lot like it. Glad I bought a used copy. Woulda been mad had I bought a new copy of this."
3,Good back up band waiting for the (magic) bus,"Trying to get into Ulmer's music because I was intrigued by his eccentricity. This cd is an improvement over Blues Preacher and Live at the Bayerischer Hof, but the material is still two-dimensional, simplistic and uninspired. This band does have decent musicians (like Bill Laswell who played with the likes of everybody from Mick Jagger to Pharoah Sanders and Sonny Sharrock), but their material lacks distinction and inspiration. Furthermore, Ulmer is still wandering in the wilderness when it comes to intelligent improvisation, if you ask me. How can he lead a band if he doesn't know where he's going?"
5,her best album,"Karla is a great vocalist,musician and writer.These three things can be seen perfectly in this album, for me her best album. Maybe you've heard ""Lose Again"" or ""Someone to lay down beside me"" by Linda Ronstadt, or ""Home"" by Bonnie Raitt, but Karla's covers of her own songs are much better. My favourite song in the album is ""Rose in the garden"" (by the way not included in the compilation of her best songs ""All my life"".)If you don't know her, I think this is the album you should buy first.Maybe you like Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Carole King.If you like these wonderful all time songwriters, you will like Karla Bonoff."
5,Songwriter Morphed Into A Songstress...,"Karla has been writing for such artists as Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, Lynn Anderson, & Wynonna Judd. Early in her career she was a backup singer for Linda Ronstadt. In 1977 she launched her solo career. Even though she personally has not made it to the top of the charts, many of her songs have. She wrote ""Somebody's Eyes"" which was featured in the movie ""Footloose"". She also wrote ""Standing Right Next To Me"" featured in the movie ""8 Seconds"". I'm heavily into Blues, Jazz & Country music & Karla's song seems to show up often along the way. That's how I discovered her. I find her voice intriguing & thoroughly enjoy her music. Check out some of her sample songs & I think you will find a place in your heart for her too!!!"
4,voice like an angel,i have a lot of her music. this cd is wonderful you can always count on her for a quality cd.
3,"If you like this, check out Wendy Waldman","This is a fine album, but those who like Bonoff should, if they haven't yet, seek out the music of her friend and fellow Bryndlian, Wendy Waldman, a composer and singer of great range who unfortunately never won the popular acclaim that Bonoff did. You owe it to yourself to buy Waldman's Warner Archives collection, LOVE IS THE ONLY GOAL, THE BEST OF WENDY WALDMAN, available here on Amazon.com. It's an 18-song collection from her 5 Warners albums from '73 to '78. (It contains some of her better known songs covered by Judy Collins and Maria Muldaur, who recorded such Waldman classics as ""Pirate Ships"" and ""Mad Mad Me"".) It's a remarkable collection of songs by perhaps this country's most underrated composer."
2,karla bonoff,"She has a beautiful voice but the songs are lame, they sound like watered down Linda Ronstandt. These songs and arrangements have not weathered the test of time. Don't bother!"
3,Amped,"Amped is a pretty good album, if you like that sort of thing. i borrowed the CD to check it out and although i didn't think it was bad, it's just not my kind of music, so maybe the three stars is a personal thing. if you're reading this, then you'll probably like it. i'm more a metal guy, and although i like the flutes (as in Whateverman) I've never liked the sax they put in along with the guitars. They're probably worth a listen though, so why not check them out?"
5,Bravo Bravia!,"Purchased two Sony Bravias,the W3000 and the V3000 and both a excellent. Very clear picture and the sound is fine. The High Def channels are awesome. The HDMI connections are so simple and don't clutter things up with lots of cables everywhere. Amazon delivered both sets on time and the people made sure all was working correctly before they left. I only wish that I had gotten the 52 inch now that I have the 46 but I love it!!"
2,"Easy to Set up, Great Picture Right out of the Box","Wow! The Sony W3000 is a great picture!! I compared this set at Circuit City with several other models and by far it outpaced the Samsung and Toshiba in picture clarity. In comparison to the lower level V or S models, it seemd that the only practical benefit was more HDMI ports for gaming, DVDs, Cable lines, etc.I bought my W3000 2 weeks ago and with Directv's HD channels, it feels as if I'm there. Most incredible pictures I've seen. I highly recommend if you spend the money on this kind of TV, you spend the money on a higher Directv or Cable package. I bought the Directv basic pacakage at 29.99 that did not have HD channels and I felt as if I had wasted my money on such a great TV. With the HD channel packages though, my tv experience improved dramatically. I highyl recommend this set so far."
4,happy,Arrived on time. Good customer service. Product has several features which we are still learning to use. Picture quality amazing!
5,Steiner's Views on Spiritual Science Explored!,"The Master taught Steiner his spiritual mission in life; to develop knowledge that synthesized science and religion. To this objective he devoted the rest of his life, guided by what he called ""the occult power behind me."" This is a lively lecture that emboldens and embraces the tenets of Anthroposophy and will illuminate any questions one might be having on the subject! Excellent reading."
3,A lethal dose of the seven deadly sins...,"I guess I should have known what I was getting into when I saw this on HBO late one night.Without giving too much away, there was one maybe two sympathetic characters. And to me it was less of a movie and more a fable or parable of what happens when ""normal"" people get hold of a lot of gold."
3,CD is nice to have if your want your basic German marchmusik,"This CD features recordings of the most widely performed German marches. Recorded around 20 years ago, the compressed sound shows that fact. It's a great CD to have - but if you really want to get a huge selection of German Marches, you must (I repeat, ""you must"") visit a store in Germany (see their online - link below) called ""Berliner Zinnfiguren."" This store sells small paintable figures and tons of military CD's. [...]I've ordered from them before and they ship promptly. They must have 20 pages of various CD's - either historical or current. This is the ultimate place to go if you want to collect German martial music."
2,In Spanish,"I saw Gavito on ""You Tube"" when he was younger so I ordered this video. It's entirely in Spanish. There is too much talking (in Spanish) and his demos are short. He has an unusual way of dancing, and his movements are jerky. For example, he demonstrates the Carpa, the tent, in which both partners lean against each other, in a 40 degree angle. This is very difficult for most tango dancers, as the preferred method is for the male to support the female, as she leans forward. ""The Sandwich"" is another example of a very difficult way to do a simple step. In this video he is quite old. There are two scenes of them dancing in a club environment, but his dancing is not as good as Javier Rodriguez, whom I consider tops. I don't suggest buying this video."
2,"Well-written, but the plot is exceedingly dull","The name of this book, while intriguing, is somehwat misleading. I expected to read a tale about an enigmatic gunfighter, but instead, was subjected to nothing more than a romance set on a ranch in the old west. The protagonist is not a particularly compelling character, and although the prose itself is well-written, the plot simply trudges along. I had to force myself to complete the book."
4,THE MYSTERIOUS RIDER BY ZANE GREY,"THE MYSTERIOUS RIDERZane Grey? All the books are classics. Well written , thoughtful, experienced by personal writing. The author is a classic himself."
4,Relationship pressure cooker,At first I thought it was a romance set in the wild west. Then it seemed to be a mystery with a ranch setting. The story line kept me guessing with twists and turns in the plot I just had to keep reading until the end to figure it out.The Mysterious Rider
5,We love this book!,"After renewing this book twice from the library we are obliged to return it. So I am here to buy it. My 3 yr old son and I don't get tired of the twisty turny repetitions in this book which have a marvelous read-aloud beat. The vocabulary is excellent. The pacing of the book is fantastic, and it lends itself to reading with great drama and emotion: drenched animals, fright, relief, compassion, pity, laugher, hope, surprise... and the illustrations are spot on. Engaging, expressive, funny, touching. Highly recommended, especially with hot soup on a rainy day!"
4,magnifica compilacion de trance,"Gatecrasher es una de esas compilaciones que siempre buscamos en musica dance: ritmo, energia y un poco de misterio. Compilacion idónea para música de discoteca o para las reuniones caseras. El perfecto estado de Gatecrasher, dos CD's perfectamente mezclados y un diseño que siempre impresiona.El CD1 tiene, a mi modo de ver, un ritmo mas positivo que el CD2, este ultimo incorpora tonos y efectos mas agresivos, pero que no dejan de lado la exquisita calidad del sonido, y es más el final del cd2, con Airwave le pone un final memorable.Recomendada para continuar con las excelentes compilaciones de trance de clubes ingleses..."
5,A Christmas tradition,"As a self-admitted Christmas junkie, I'm always on the lookout for movies and books to make my own personal holiday experience a little richer. I found that in ""Shepherds Abiding"", even though at that point I had not read any of Karon's other Mitford novels. The story is fairly simple and uplifting, but something about it appealed to my soul so much that I now make it a point to reread the book every year when fall comes and I can feel the holidays beginning to stir (which happens early on with crafters--so much to do and so little time to do it!) I also have it unabridged on cd so that I can listen to it if my hands are otherwise occupied, and I don't have that many books on cd. I've given copies of this to almost all of my friends in case their spirits need a little renewing during this time of year. If you are looking for an easy, comfortable read, this is it and it stands alone quite well without having to read the entire series. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
1,And they'll abide a little longer if it's a book they await,"Karon's latest book achieves the length of a novel only through the grace of wide margins and generous line spacing; its content would barely sustain a short story. A long-time Mitford series fan, I was severely disappointed in this latest installment: Karon presents us with nothing more than a vague, breezy update on some of the village's inhabitants - no depth of character or emotion; no real turmoil or triumph; no spiritual insight or inspiration. And precious little plot to boot. The book gives new meaning to the phrase ""painted with a broad brush;"" indeed, Karon seems to have employed a roller. If you're a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
3,Too much repeat from previous books,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Mitford Series, having read them more than once. A book that is written in such a way as to have you laughing out loud is a well-written book that allows you to become part of the cast of characters. I was disappointed in Shepherds Abiding because it seemed to me to be excerpts from other books and lacked the humor so integral ot the others. I don't like to have authors ride on their success by rehashing rather than creating. If Jan Karon has nothing new to say about Mitford then she should be honest about it and let the series stand on its own merits."
3,A NICE HOLIDAY STORY,"This was my first experience with the Mitford Series. The cover looked great, and it being two weeks before Christmas, I picked it up at a book sale for Literacy Volunteers. While I felt that I was missing something by not knowing the characters, it really didn't matter. Karon darts back and forth with the characters along the plot line. It is like a novel on amphetemines. (Maeve Binchy does this threading of plot from character to character- but so much better. She might even spend a full chapter on one subplot to truly engage the reader.) With Shepherds Abiding, my head was spinning. You could read the whole book in one sitting as it lacked depth. Cute story, nice story, simple story. Was there ever a doubt how all of the loose ends would tie together by the end?"
1,Very disappointed,The first review described my feelings exactly. There is no plot in this book and very little substance. And I was very very bored by the end. Painting shepherds is not a compelling enough plot.
1,3 and 1/2 stars. A better story than I first gave it credit for.,I am editing this as of 12/26/08 & could not manage to change the stars to reflect it but my first impression has changed. In a couple of Ms. Karon's other efforts she has produced small short stories and sold them as such to those who will buy anything with the word MITFORD on it. And so when this came out I was quick to cry foul as it runs far shorter than I would have liked. As I love recorded books I got it from the library as an audio and as always John McDonough did an outstanding job. Now that time has passed I listened agian and the story was more satisfying. And the part with Fr. Tim & Co. in The Tea Shop ordering lunch was a howl.
2,Sorely Disappointing,"After reading the previous books(the first 3 more than once), it was w/ much anticipation that I ordered this. Too much time has passed between the release of new editions to the series, therefore it's easy to forget parts. Also, not much substance or plot to this one and the print was so big, I didn't even need my glasses! It felt like a drawn-out 'Esther's Gift'. Lots of foreshadowing of things to come, but nothing ever does.Since Karon is coming out w/a cookbook in 2004, it's easy to see where the recipes will come from (orange marmalade cake, risotto, tea-room menu. Gee, I'll bet there will even be a section for diabetics!) I feel scammed and definitely will wait to check out the last installment from the library."
1,sigh,"Wholesome, sure. Entertaining... not on your life. This entire series is great bed reading for people who can't sleep. It's certainly cheaper and far less adicting than sleeping pills."
2,Mitford book #8 disappointing,"Loved the first seven Mitford books, but this one did not have much substance. Almost seemed like Karon threw this one together in a hurry. She is usually a wonderful writer but this one was different."
5,Arrived Quickly as Amazon orders always do....,"I ordered a bunch of books....All came together and were in good condition....I have not gotten to that book in the series yet, but am sure I will enjoy it as I have the first 6 of Jan Karon's books....."
3,Not enough substance,I am truly a fan of Jan Karon but this book was a disappointment to me. Too much of the same thing. Too much of Father Tim's diabetes (we all know he has it) and not enough about the young people. I want to know what Dooley is doing and also Lace and somehow the other child needs to be found. But I had a feeling this was written just to fill up pages. I reread all the Mitford Series every January and saved this one till last and found it shallow compared to the previous books.Hopefully the next one will tie up the loose ends of what is happening to all.
2,Need to read the earlier books in the series first.,That's all I have to say but Amazon is making me add 20 more words. 5 more to go. BOO
5,SHEPHERDS ABIDING,Mitford series is wonderful! I recommend reading the entire series of these books. The characters of the books become a part of your family!
2,OK story but the style could use some work,"This story jumps around telling spurts of different people's lives. All of these people live in the same town, but there are so many people that it's difficult to keep track of all of them. Often when a scene changes, the author starts with ""He"" or ""She"" so the reader doesn't know which one of the many characters is being presented. The author also likes to start these scene changes other ways that are kind of secretive. Although this method is a tactic that can be used to add mystery, intrigue and to draw the reader in, when it is used so frequently throughout a story, it instead is apt to cause confusion and make the reader feel off balanced."
5,Super series,"I read the entire Mitford series, so this book was up to the great level of all the stories in the series...just precious.The quality of this used book was as advertised. Happy with my purchase."
5,Shepherds Abiding,"This is my favorite Christmas book. It is the most gentle, beautiful story of a man's love for his wife. I have read it every Christmas and NEVER tire of it. Thank you."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book, and was glad I waited to check it out from the library rather than buy it. I was expecting a lot more than I got. It was nothing more than a long drawn out version of the smaller Christmas books, Esther's Gift, and The Mitford Snowmen. I believe the author could've done more to develope the characters-Dooley Barlowe was barely even mentioned-It was a charming little Christmas story-which does warm the heart, but leaves a lot wanting. I'm hoping the final book will be back up to the standard I've grown to love in the rest of the series."
1,Not her best book...,"I have loved all of Jan Karon's previous books. Have read some twice even. I looked forward to meeting my favorite characters again. I am not sure how to describe this very short book. I always have told my kids the teacher will notice huge fonts and generous double spacing. We have noticed Jan! Also, I never did get a feel for the story even though it started out in a familiar way, then boom! on to the next story. Please for the new readers, do not start with this book. It will not make any sense to you. Read the series from the start. Buy the series even, but borrow this from the library."
3,"You'll enjoy it, but also try....","I had only read the first of Ms. Karon's Mitford books, and I liked it very much. I snatched this one up next because I love a Christmas story. Though it did not have the depth of activity and character as the first book, it was a pleasant read. It was while searching for something to read between Van Reid's Moosepath League novels that I decided to try Jan Karon, and I'm glad I did. I will go back, now, and read her others. But if you're looking for the best recent Christmas book, try Van Reid's ""Daniel Plainway."" More than one reviewer made mention of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" when discussing ""Daniel Plainway"" and with good reason. It takes place in Maine in 1897 and has all the generosity and magic that we look for in a great Christmas novel. But don't overlook ""Shepherd's Abiding."" If the subject matter interests you or you're a Karon fan, I think you'll enjoy it."
2,Disappointed,"I am terribly disappointed by Shepherds Abiding. Maybe my expectations were too high. I was expecting a novel in the series and got another like The Common Life. But even more so, the writing was not at all up to Ms Karon's standards. There were throwaway references to the usual cast of characters. The description of a big event in the lives of two of the minor characters had no life to it, and Percy and Velma's retirement seemed flat. There was no verve to this book, and I'm surprised at Ms Karon. I wish I hadn't bougtht the book."
2,Disappointed that this was disappointing!,"I love Mitford.I love Jan Karon's writing. I love every one of the characters in the town she has created. But I didn't love this book - and that's disappointing. I was looking forward to another few hours in the company of Mitford happenings, and found, instead, a brief coffee break. For true Mitford fans, that just isn't enough. I hope that the last book in the series will be full, and complete, and engrwossing, and satisfying. Anything less than that just doesn't do the town - or the characters - justice."
1,A short story dressed up like a novel,"As with most of the other reviewers, I LOVE the Mitford series! This one, however, felt like a shoddy attempt at getting a product on the market in time for the holidays. The publishers should have removed the excessive white space (wide margins and large line spacing) and sold it as a short story.Were it sold as a short story, I would have given it four stars instead of one. As it is, I was left feeling cheated and disappointed.I can't wait for Jan Karon's next real novel. I trust that the next one will feel like the earlier books in the series, and will wrap up the story for us. Hopefully she will give her readers what they are so hungry for.... character development, a rich plot, and information on what Dooley and Lace make of their lives!"
4,A good not great one...,"I love the sense of peace and hope that I always feel after reading these books. This one fell a little short for me, not the depth I would like to have seen. I do have to tell you about another book that I just read that left me feeling the hope and peace I was hoping to feel with Shepherds Abiding. Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin he is a new author and I hope he writes many more..."
1,Something bad has happened to this once-good series,"I came across this and thought, ""Finally! A new Mitford book."" And I wondered how I'd missed it. Once I got the book in hand, I realized I had not missed anything. This is not a new Mitford novel but a little story with some other previously published stuff thrown in. It's a big disappointment. I was so annoyed to realize that I'd paid a book price for a little story that I didn't even enjoy the story itself. It isn't the money, actually. It's that I was all set to relax and be drawn into Mitford again for a nice long visit. This short story sent me packing far too soon. Someone needs to let this author know that her readers are waiting for another REAL Mitford book. I won't buy anything like this again."
2,Mitford - Lite,"I would characterize this book as ""Mitford Lite"" - just does not stand up to the high standards we have come to expect in the Mitford books. Previous reviewers hit the nail on the head when they expressed dismay at the flimsy plot line....a story of Father Tim re-finishing a manger scene just couldn't quite hold my attention, and the sub plots weren't very compelling either. I'm chalking this up to the author and her publisher giving us a ""snack"" to keep us sated until the next, and last, Mitford book comes out in 2005 . I'll still read the final book, but hopefully Ms. Karon will complete this series by giving her readers the rich and descriptive writing for which she is deservedly famous."
3,Charming but disappointing,"I've been a Jan Karon fan since the beginning and enjoyed most of her books, but find the early editions much more entertaining and inspiring. I love the characters, but wished there could be more insights, a broadening of their character. I find the new Dosetville series by Katherine Valentine much richer fare."
3,Pretty Good,"This product is pretty good, but it could definitely use more micro beads. Without it, the products comes out and feels more like a lotion and kind of sits on your face."
3,Small,"This hat is okay. The material is nice enough. It's definitely one of thos small, lumpy little hats that just kind of sits limp on top of your head though.If you want a firm, baseball-style cap, look elsewhere. This is more for dads raking the yard."
1,Way too small,"Either my head is huge or this hat is made for children. It did not fit at all, and the product page did not specify how small the hat is."
2,disappointed,Ordered this for my husband for x-mas. Disappointed this hat wasn't structured. Threw it in the back of the closet. I might wear it someday.
1,Small,This cap is small for me and I thinking about returning it.One star since the size is not specified.
4,"quality good, style nah",After sticking it onto my head I can tell that the style isn't up to par. This is a hat I'd gift to someone rather than wear. But still quality is exellent.
3,Not the best,"The hat is a bit small for my head. It adjusts around perfectly, but it doesn't come down very far from the top of my head. It feels like it wants to fall off just wearing it normally, even when it's tight on my head. It's also not terribly comfortable. But, it's a hat, and if you don't have a big head, it's worth getting."
1,They discontinued there sell,"I had ordered this Burnt Orange/ Light Sand Vintage Washed Contrast Baseball Cap, after i paid and waited for two weeks they had finally told me that they had discontinued making them and were out of stock, without giving me my money back, I just dislike how they didn't tell me and that they still advertised it."
2,Flimsy and not impressive,The hat came in a plastic bag and looked a bit dull. I ended up buying my dad another hat and sending this one back. Maybe for a younger guy?
3,sizing is tight,"The cap seems well constructed, but at 5' 7"" tall and with a normal sized head, this low profile cap fits tight. Would not buy again."
3,On the small side,"It's a nice hat with good material but its a little high on the head, I feel like it would fly off easily even with it adjusted tighter."
5,Very nice hat,It's a nicer hat than I expected. Fits nicely and is made of a nice material. The two-tone color works well. I will definitely be ordering more.
2,"I like the look, but it has faded horribly","I like this look of this hat. The navy color is nice and the tan stitching prevents it from just looking like a blob of color on my head. However, after owning the hat for a month or so, the color is fading horribly and unevenly. There is a big blog of faded color on the font to where it almost looks like something spilled on it. I can guarantee you that I spilled nothing on it. Other parts of it are fading as well. For the price of this hat, the color should have held up longer than a month. It the color didn't fade in such a blotchy way, I would definitely rate this hat higher. But as it is now, I'll probably only wear it while doing chores in the yard."
5,Great cap fast delicevy,"Is a really nice cap, it fits great and the delivery time was less than I expected, I would definately purchase from port authority again, simply great."
5,High speed maths,"I LOVE this book. It opened the door to many other high speed mental maths books.It is not always 100% easy to follow, but 99% is a fair amount. He was a brilliant man."
3,Mistakes,"I have an old copy of this book, published about 1970, I believe. I've been working though it, and was very happy with it...until I got to multiplication by 5. I don't know if it's fixed later, but the method given is incorrect every time except the problem used as an example! I have triple- and quadruple-checked my answers and have come up with the exact same wrong ones every time I use the rule given. Somehow I doubt all those people who have written those glowing reviews have actually read all the way through the dang book. Either that or it was fixed in a later edition and I simply don't know about it. If anyone has some sort of answer for me, please email me at lady_michiko@yahoo.com. Thank you."
5,Fantastic book,"This is a fantastic book, even for non-maths types. So intuitive, you wonder why it's not taught in schools. Shame about the price tho - try your local library....?"
5,I ordered the book!,"I'm here to say that I ordered the book A Chorus of Voices from seeing it on an on line author biography. A friend showed it to me. It took a while to get to my address but when it did I have to say, it's splendid. Each writer contained within this book had something special to offer the reader. If you like classic poetry, and free verse you will enjoy this anthology of works form some of the most talented writers in this world. They come from all over the world as a matter of fact. It's necessary read for anyone that enjoys quality writing with the literary minded reader in mind.Sincerely,Steve H."
1,piece of crap dvd player,"I received this Panasonic piece of crap as a Xmas ""gift"" much to my chagrin as I'd sworn off buying ANY Panasonic products after they refused to help with a problem that occurred with a very expensive 2.4 phone. I may have used the DVD S25 unit a total of JUST FIVE OR SIX times before it suddenly gave me ""no disc"" messages. I take impeccable care of ALL my electronic equipment. The F-ing warranty for Labor (90 days) is a joke as it took me close to 6 months for the problem to surface. They wanted at least $90 to fix it. The unit cost $80 brand new. Now they are online for $55. BOYCOTT ALL PANASONIC PRODUCTS!"
3,Other countries,I wanted to get this Item for my parents wedding anniversary. They reside in India I just wanted to know if someone knows a way to convert the voltage source from American to Indian. Has anyone done this before.Also does this player play WMV files. I have a few movie discs that are in a WMV format. let me knowChandra
3,If you still have an old TV......,"I have an old TV so I had to buy a modulator (a small box that conects cords) since it wasn't compatable with the DVD player. The picture quality isn't that great. The buttons on the remote to skip during a video are horrible. Either it moves really slow or too fast, like 30min. of video in 2 seconds. If you click the subtitles button during a movie, you only get the menu, not subtitles.The most annoying thing is not being able to change the widescreen mode. I read the instruction book and went to the Video tab and saw that it was in Regular mode yet all the movies I watch I'm forced to see in Letterbox style where the picture only uses 1/3 - 1/4 of my screen!!!"
1,Panasonic Died After Two Years,"I didn't purchase this one, but I would have to give the Panasonic DVD players a BIG Thumbs DOWN. I received the PANASONIC DVD-RV31 as a gift from Amazon.com two years ago. After limited household basic use, it just stopped working. I received an error message (HO2) and the Panasonic Service told me to go to a local repair shop. It will be cheaper to buy a new Player, so that's what I plan to do. I would strongly suggest another brand of DVD player (JVC is what I have for other components with much success). I'll never get Panasonic again!!!!"
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Bad motors HO error,"I also, thought that Panasonic still made quality. We were all wrong. Just out of warranty the motor quit (HO7 error) as have MANY,MANY others. I checked the google search and this problem runs through most of their product line. Bye bye Panny; hello Sony."
1,mine's dead,"had this model for about 16 months, it was nice... now it can't seem to find its place in the disk... its spins and whirs and jumps around the disk like a monkey... then plays 10 seconds of the video and does it all again. I've tried many disks, cleaning the lens, etc... its headed for the dumpster"
2,"A few years of use, now it freezes.","After a few years of normal use, my S25 player started freezing in the middle of movies.No error codes or anything would come up on the display, the picture and soundjust stops while the read head tracks around trying to find itself. I've cleanedthe lens with alcohol. That didn't help. I've reinitialized the machine. Thatdidn't help. Panasonic wants more money to repair it than it would cost me to buya new one. I've bought a lot of things from Panasonic over the years. In recentyears though, I've had three different Panasonic products fail on me prematurely.I'm all through with them. I'd welcome any suggestions from anyone who might know howto fix it who is willing to share. Hopefully it doesn't need a new optical pickup. Isaw one on a parts list. They want 85% of the cost of a new machine for it. Not worthit."
3,I bought this 5 years ago and today the door gets stuck!,"First off I bought this dvd player back 5 years ago and just today did the door decide to get stuck! This incident happened only once before but worked again. I had to buy a new dvd player! I'm pretty mad because I want a dvd player I come across to last a long time. I mean more than 5 years. VCRS last longer, but have way worse quality. I think there should be DVD players that don't break easily..."
1,Worthless,"This is my second panasonic dvd player. The first one started freezing after about a year of consistant use. Well, needless to say, I didn't learn from my mistakes. I bought this model and after about a year it froze. I have tried cleaning them both with a dvd/cd player cleaning disc. Neither dvd player will even read the disc. I held on to the other one just in case. I just threw both of them in the garbage. I will not buy anything panasonic again!This dvd really didn't have anything special on it either. It played discs fine until it died! There isn't a big display screen; it isn't fancy at all. For the price of something like this, you can find a better model, make, and quality at a cheaper price. This thing is useless."
2,won't play video discs,"For all this money, this unit is nothing special, It don't play SVCD or VCD movies.These are movies usually burned to CD-r discs. from a home computer."
2,Not even an answer key to the exercises,"The book is easy to understand, but there should be a solutions manual, or at least an answer key to the exercises. It has been very difficult for me to ""learn the mechanics"" and ""apply the concepts"" at the end of each chapter. The pace of the course allows the teacher to solve only 2 or 3 exercises in class, and the book certainly does not make selfstudy easy. Needless to say, that you can't learn financial accounting just by reading. To makes things even worse, a study guide, which does not refer to the same exercises in the book, is out of print."
2,Stopped working after a year,"I'm definitely in the minority here.I had a C400 which suddenly stopped working (shutter stopped working). Unfortunately, I didn't find out about it until I had wasted several rolls of film. Luckily, the snapshots I took were replaceable. Still I expected more from Kodak.If the reviews here are any indication, you will have better luck than I did."
2,Part 1 is a slow tempo Urban style CD,Part 1 is a slow tempo Urban style CD offering 3 mixes of My Love is Your Love: Radio Edit 4min;Wyclef mix 4.3 min; Marvel & Eily vocal mix 7 min.
1,i want my $1.42 back,"i heard about colepitz through a fellow tool fan, and i won't be taking his advice so easily next time. making ""dark, heavy"" music doesn't necessarily mean singing every song in a minor key with a flat, out of tune, melody. anyone who remembers booing tomahawk off the stage when they openned for tool a few years back, this is scarily similar, and worse. toxic to the ears, and the soul."
2,"another live, ""best of""","Yet, another ""best of"" package, this time live, butchering every hit song eric has ever recorded. The question is why was this released? The quality of recording is good but the music no longer matches the songs. It's like the songs have been done so many times over they are just sped through. The whole recording demonstrates how eric burdon and brian auger have reduced themselves to a bar band cashing in on decades worth of material. The musicians performance are fair at best. I was really disappointed that nowhere do you hear brian augers keyboard capabilities. Order this through your local library or pass on it. Not worth the price asked for."
5,A very efficient product!,"Very easy to use, and goes great with the stainless steel look in your kitchen. A must if you have SS appliances."
2,"Good looks, bad performance","I'm a huge OXO fan. This is the first product of theirs I've ever returned. 2 hands are required to remove a sheet of toweling with this holder, and even then it's not a smooth operation. It gets 2 stars for appearance only."
3,Pretty good,"My only complaint is that the ""plunger"" system to keep the center rotating mechanism in place is less than perfect. it's a pretty paper towel holder, but for the price I had honestly expected the unit to work as expected. When trying to tear off paper towels, try as I might there is still some unexpected ""spinning"" of the paper towel roll no matter how hard I push down on the top ""locking""mechanism."
4,Perfect for the Kitchen,It is just what I expected after reading the description and reviewing photos and reviews online. Matches my appliances in my kitchen perfectly. I have only had it for a month or so and it seems very sturdy and I think it will last for a long time.
4,"helpful, but a bit over the top","I recommend this for finding a good base in understanding conventional vs natural birthing methods. She makes several good arguments for natural birthing methods and supports most of them with research. I found the book helpful in my search for information, especially the pro/con lists supplied at the end of certain segments. However, I felt that she went a bit overboard in some cases, almost resorting to scare tactics and guilt trips (on mother to be) in making her argument against conventional or mainstream methods."
3,Good for research information,Like many other reviewers said this book is biased. The author gives this disclaimer at the beginning and how her purpose for the book is in hoping to revert her readers to her opinions and beliefs. I found it good for offering up research statistics and pros and cons of all interventions during childbirth. It's good to read and read other things and then decide what choices are right for you.
2,Too technical for me,I didn't need such a technical guide..I was expecting it to be written freindlier.
2,"Inform yourself, but check the copyright year","I chose not to purchase this book based, ironically enough, on the positive recommendations. It sounds as if this book may be in need of an update, as episiotomies and other interventions are no longer 'routine' in many places, and many hospitals work cooperatively with midwives and doulas. Anesthesia has also changed a lot in the past 8 years since this book was published. While it may be good resource for prompting questions to your OB and hospital, it would be best to look for more up-to-date facts. I have found that this is true of many of these 'expecting' type books."
5,"Insightful, Well-Researched","So many women trust their OB/GYN implicitly; this book forces a woman to think for herself and make her own decisions in regards to her prenatal care. OBs are surgeons, and as such, tend to follow a medical model of care. Pregnancy and childbirth is not a disease, and should not be treated as such. This book offers thought-provoking statistics and information that allow a woman to carefully consider the type of prenatal care she wishes to receive."
5,"""If you don't know your options, you don't have any.""","Whether your having a hospital or a homebirth, this book is relevant. Every pregnant woman will face decisions about the care of her body. This book will arm you with facts to evaluate options for yourself. That's the message of this book: you have choices, even if your doctor or midwife does not present them to you. And choosing to trust your caregiver to make decisions for you is valid for some women. But educating yourself can only make your birth better not worse."
5,The Book every pregnant woman needs to read!,"This book is AWESOME, it has so much great info in it. It literally covers everything that you might encounter in your pregnancy and birth and gives objective reviews about BOTH sides of the issue, not just one like most books do. It will tell you the pros and cons of every choice you make, and gives astounding statistics on the rates of c-sections and much more. This book is a must have for all of those wanting or expecting a baby, and for those doulas and midwives who want to learn more or just have a good book around to reference!Rach"
2,"A biased book: the ""Thinking Woman"" wants to know BOTH sides!","I was very disappointed with the content and overall tone of this book. I went to the library looking to find an unbiased guide of what to expect during the birth of my child, and instead came back with a very anti-medical diatribe that tells women why they should NOT have certain procedures. I wanted to be able to read about what to expect, and then MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF. I question why this book was titled ""The Thinking Woman's Guide"" now, as it really gives you nothing to think about as much as it bestows guilt.Goer fails to play devil's advocate on the side of obstetrics, again and again stating that there are no ""pros"" to some procedures and tests. Oddly enough, the blurb on the book's back cover reads ""But when it comes to one of the most important decisions of your life - how you will give birth - it is hard to garther accurate, unbiased information."" Interesting how Goer falls into the trap of bias herself."
2,"Good information, negative tone","I didn't enjoy this book at all. I thought it had great information, but it was conveyed in such a negative light. The medical profession was portrayed as evil bloodsucking beings who want nothing but to ruin your magical birthing experience and damage your baby. I stopped reading it because while I want to be informed, I also trust my doctor. I had a fabulous birth experience in a hospital anyway and my daughter is not a fire monster."
1,"Childbirth gets the ""Michael Moore"" treatment","I was raised to think that books are our friends, and should be treated with respect. Which is why I've never thrown away or recycled a book in my 30+ years. Until this one. I was so disappointed in the incredibly biased tone and her inappropriate slant on the subject that I tossed this book -- even though it was loaned to me by a dear friend! My justification is that this isn't a helpful book for anyone approaching birth to read.In fact, this book pushed me further towards a traditional hospital birth. It wasn't until I watched the e-class from my hospital with birth videos of natural and epidural births shown objectively that I decided I'd prefer natural. I feel like the respectful thing for the author to do would be to inform the readers of their options, not to use scare tactics and misleading information to support her own position."
3,"Good information, too much documentation on research","Overall, this book was very informative. Was disappointed almost 50% of the book was dedicated to citing the research that supports the facts shared in the main part of the book."
3,For the Thinking Woman who wants a natural birth,"If you're anti-medical establishment and definitely thinking of having a natural birth, then this book is perfect for you. If, however, you're looking for an unbiased book, this is not the book for you. While full of helpful information, the author is very up front about being an advocate for natural birthing, and doesn't have much positive to say about medical practices or practitioners (OB/GYNs, hospital nurses, etc). For those who want a balanced look at both sides, this book doesn't quite cut it."
1,13 Years Out of Date!,"This book touts being up to date with research and current information regarding the issues facing those of us delivering in today's hospitals or other settings. I was really looking forward to a book that I could read that would provide me with research based information to prepare for my upcoming birth. Unfortunately, the year is now 2012 and the book was last updated in 1999. This means that the research that the book was based on is 13 years old! Unfortunately for this Thinking Woman, that is just too out of date.I know for a fact that things have changed for the better, probably in part because of this book. I think it's time for an update!"
3,Excellent Information- A Few Drawbacks,"Although I expected a natural birth perspective (which I share), I was disappointed in the book's overwhelmingly negative tone toward OB's. I would have prefered a balanced, relatively objective discussion. I expected it from a book called The Thinking Womans Guide.... If the stats are so glaring, a balanced discussion is better than dogmatics.This is an excellent book for those who have decided to give birth naturally. It is not one to recommend to friends to help them make the decision about their birth. It will turn many women off. A better book for an introduction to the benefits of natural birth and the drawbacks of managed care is Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn by Penny Simkin."
2,Incredible Anti-Hospital Agenda,"I had been recommended this book to educate myself on what type of practices I might expect at the hospital. I think most pregnant women already hope to minimize the amount of intervention during labor and delivery without all the scare tactics of this book.Some bits of information were indeed helpful, and will arm the reader with questions for their medical provider on why certain options should or should not be employed (episiotomy, epidural, etc.) However, the tone is the book is so shrill and stridently anti-hospital that you come away with the impression that if the only safe and ""right"" way pregnant woman should give birth is to do a home delivery with a midwife. Frankly, that's limiting a woman's choices rather than empowering her to make decisions.Instead, I recommend people read Birthing From Within."
1,this book isn't for everyone....,"it certainly wasn't for me. I was hoping to find (and since have, in a different book) helpful information and tips on how to deliver my baby without inducement, epidural, or other medical intervention. Henci Goer's book is about what she feels is wrong with the medical establishment. While her information may or may not be true, it is irrelevent to me... I would have appreciated a more positive approach to what one can do to prepare for a ""better birth"" (as the title offers) versus her negative approach to what is wrong with current medical practice. The book I ended up buying that has been incredibly helpful, non-preachy, unbiased, and comforting is ""Easing Labor Pain - The complete Guide to a More Comfortable and Rewarding Birth"" by Adrienne Lieberman. It is unopinionated and very positive and is making me look forward to the birth of my first child and also giving me the encouragement and helpful tips I hoped to find on natural childbirth."
3,very negative and scarey,"I read this book, expecting to find information on natural healthy childbirth. However, the author largely focuses on the negatives of hospitalized births with OBs. It is informative and well researched, but left me feeling that I would have to be on the offensive in order to make sure I had a natural birth and avoid unnecessary interventions. I would greatly have preferred to hear more positive options, what women CAN do, what choices and tools we DO have. And so, I much preferred Birthing From Within by Pam England and have given it to several friends.Birthing from Within: An Extra-Ordinary Guide to Childbirth Preparation"
2,Biased to a great degree,I feel this book is very biased. Read other one and find the ones that don't give such judgemental information.
1,Read Other Books Too,It seems to me that this book encourages women not to listen to Doctors and to only listen to the methods in this book. It gives you some preparation for seeing a Dr but really tells you not to. Not sound practices. I know many women who have natural birth and they read many books to get different viewpoints.
1,Unbalanced. Unhelpful.,"This books is not helpful if you are an impending mother who wants to get balanced information about birth and the different options. I had to stop reading this book as all it did was make me feel guilt and apprehension about giving birth in a hospital - albeit with a supportive, non-interventionist obstetrician.Reviewers are correct in saying that the book has research to back up its statements but research can generally be found to support any view on things such as this, particularly given that no true statistical studies can be done due to ethical considerations of assigning women to birth methods.The book also uses things that are ""negatives"" of hospitals (lots of equipment) as ""positives"" of birthing centers (equipment to deal with emergencies)."
1,Preachy and biased...,"I only give it 1 star because there are some informative parts. But mostly it was very preachy, anti-doctor/hospital and very one sided. ""My way or the highway""-like.The author doesn't believe that a hospital birth is any good and the best way to birth is at home or a birthing center. Obstretricans are evil. All that stuff.There were a few moments of helpfulness when the author would discuss generalities or procedures...but other than that, useless. Borrow from a library but do not support this author!"
2,Overly critical of the medical profession,"I found this book querulous and defensive. The author is much too eager to heap blame and criticism upon the medical profession. (For those curious: I am neither a doctor nor a man. I am a woman outside the medical profession, expecting my second child.) Although I read this book for the alternate viewpoint, it ultimately served to confirm my instinctive suspicions about today's birthing crusaders and the use of doulas. I had a positive experience birthing my first child in a hospital with my husband at my side and without a bunch of extraordinary demands and conditions, and look forward to a similiarly positive experience with my second child. My doctor (a male who graduated medical school in the '60s, for anyone wondering) is sensitive to my concerns, is aware of and makes use of the most modern approaches to childbirth, and is someone with whom I feel comfortable and whom I would trust with my life. Sorry to disappoint you, ladies."
3,Valuable research statistics,"This book has valuable research about medical procedures common in birth that can be valuable to someone wanting to learn more about their options. The author is biased - she declares this at the beginning - so read it with a grain of salt. Realize that she is trying to convince you that her viewpoint is the only correct one, based on the research. If you are a ""thinking woman"" as the book title proclaims to be a book for thinking women, then read her information and read other information and then sit down and THINK about what is best for you. No one can tell you what is best for you, but this is an accessible guide to some research studies that have been done so that you can feel you are making an educated decision for the health and well-being of you and your baby."
2,Not what I was expecting,"What I was expecting with this book was a clear, unbiased look at various birthing options so a ""thinking woman"" could understand everything and make a good choice for herself and also more info on VBACs. This author considers a ""thinking woman"" to be one that wants a natural, unmedicated childbirth, attended by a midwife, at a birthing center or at home. If this is you, you can be assured that this book backs your stance and provides scary statistics to make you believe that birthing in a hospital with an OB is an irresponsible and dangerous choice at best. Although my plan for my birth experience was an ""all natural"" one and I can agree with this author's bias, I find the way she wrote this book, that I can't take it seriously and have actually returned it. I would highly recommend ""Birth After Cesarean"" for a factual look at VBAC (though I wish they had an updated version) and would look elsewhere for a ""thinking woman's"" guide."
4,Great Book,"This book gave me great insight into pregnancy in general. It was very informative and helped me understand things that could possibly go wrong and what options I would have at that point. I make it a point to be prepared no matter what I'm doing and being pregnant was definitely no exception. I would recommend this book to everyone, even if you've already had children, just so you know what options you have in case something unexpected happens. It does have some medical terminology in there, but it wasn't hard to figure out since I'm a massage therapist."
3,A little overbearing,"I read this while PG and I have to say now I realise a good part of it was true. HOWEVER, it really can make a person already nervous a little over paranoid of things that if you deliver in a hospital you won't have control over anyway. It was a good book and had good references of research. Kinda pushy on the unassisted side of delivering options."
2,Informative... Sort of.,"While this book raises quite a few good points, some of the suggestions in it seem dangerous to me. ""Refuse ultrasounds to date the pregnancy and assign a due date"" Are you kidding me? What mother is going to refuse an ultrasound for ANY reason? ""Refuse tests unless it is a life-or-death situation"" Well, it seems to me that by the time most issues become life-or-death, that they could have been diagnosed and managed through ultrasounds! That aside, the book repeatedly trashes the medical community as ""ignorant and habitually endangering the natural process of labor and delivery.""Aside from the handful of thought-provoking points, this book is dry and difficult to get through. I'm a medical student, and some of the terms I had to look up, either because they're too new or too old, or just plain confusing. It's an informative book, but I would not buy it again or recommend it to another expectant mother."
4,Great Source of Information,"I really like this book, it is full of information on Hospital Birth and this book is what made me feel confident enough to switch to a Birth Center...The author is definitley one sided but it has a lot of stats and good information."
2,A non-thinking woman's guide,"Horrible and outdated book. She needs to cite each point in the chapter instead of at the end of the book. Makes numerous assumptions without evidence to back it up. When you look up her sources, they often don't support what she claim's they support. She is obviously incredibly biased against obstetricians. Her opening argument that obstetrician-gynecologists are ""trained to view pregnant and laboring women as a series of potential problems"" is frankly BS. She lost all credibility in her opening paragraphs. Her supposed knowledge about the medical literature is laughable. A simple pubmed search will bring up numerous problems with her assumptions on each topic. It's obvious she selectively cite's to her advantage. I do not recommend if you are really searching for an unbiased and comprehensive guide."
5,Superb,"This is a must read. Pregnant women in America are simply not informed of the risks (and degredations) of current obstetric practices: they are not informed of their options and their rights. American doctors intervene in 90% of pregnancies yet America ranks only 23rd among the nations of the world in good outcomes (both mother and baby healthy). Holland, in contrast, uses obstetricians only 30% of the time, in the cases when they are really needed and Holland ranks #1 among nations as the safest place to give birth. Read why. It's fascinating and ultimately empowering for women."
2,Not for a woman who wants a medicated birth,This book was very much against hospital births and epidurals. I didn't like that the author assumed every woman would want to birth HER WAY. An epidural birth can still be a very wonderful birth experience. I got to enjoy my medicated VBAC because I was not in any pain and I could concentrate on what I was there to do - push out and birth a baby. I know women who have done birthing both ways and they were successful either way you look at it. You can be a THINKING WOMAN and still have a wonderful epidural or hospital birth. Reading this book is fine if you want a home birth or an unmedicated birth.
2,Disappointed,"While this book contains good information and cites many research studies (a significant portion of the book is devoted to documenting research), the author's tone seemed negative to me. Ms. Goer obviously has some hostile feelings towards the medical community, and as the book progressed, this became distracting to me. I much preferred ""The Birth Book,"" by William and Martha Sears, which contains similar information and outlines the same pros/cons, but manages to be very positive."
1,"The only ""thinking woman"" this book thinks about is the author.","I bought this book because I wanted to read more about labor and delivery and form my own conclusions on what is best for me. I quickly found that this book is full of propaganda on the part of the author to sway the reader over to her way of thinking.Now, some of the information I agree with but some of it I don't. And in none of the chapters is the reader presented with unbiased options or data from which to form her own opinions.This thinking woman was not impressed and did not find this book helpful. I would recommend revising the title to ""If you're not sure what to think then I'll tell you...""."
2,Not Worth Reading,"The author has a great deal of knowledge in the area of childbirth, but has a very clinical view, which is a real put-off. At the same time, the book scares the reader when it comes to C-sections. I'm certainly not a C-section advocate, but I also realize that sometimes a C-section may be necessary. As a woman who is simply educating myself before becoming pregnant, this book gave me second thoughts about it all the way around! I would not recommend this book under any circumstance to first time mothers or those who have a medical condition which requires a C-section - a much better read would be Birthing From Within by Pam England."
1,NON Thinking Woman's Guide,"I got this book as a gift. Was extremely put off by the author's biased opinion. She goes as far to say that female doctors in obstetrics just follow the male herd's opinion and have no mind of their own. If you have a mind of your own, get a different book - one that will lay out both sides of the argument in a non-biased manner. Also, be mindful of the fact that the information concerning obstetrics in the book is at least 15 years out of date."
1,Awful Bias opinions,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had initially bought it thinking that I would get facts, but instead I found that it is based on someone's opinions about how they feel everyone should give birth. I would like to get my $10 if it were possible since it was a waste of money that went against my beliefs."
3,"Not fair balanced, a bit scary, but still informative","This book is informative but it's so pro-natural childbirth that it tends to totally discount medical science and interventions. Although I feel childbirth should be a natural process and that modern medicine can interfere (mainly with precautionary measures), I still appreciate the necessity and value of obstetrics and medical doctors. Parts of this book are so extreme it seems as if the author feels obstetrics is a ridiculous and unnecessary medical field. It really turned me off to the book as a whole. It also seems that some parts were written to frighten people and make them suspicious of their physician/health care professionals, which I don't think is helpful or healthy. Other parts, however, are very informative and help you understand your options to help achieve natural childbirth. I think the book is helpful, but proceed with an open mind. . . and caution."
5,A must read!,"Henci Goer has provided the information needed in very readable terms for all women to have a better birth. Backed with extensive research, Goer clears up common misconceptions and obstetrical myths that are running rampant in childbirth in this country. As a childbirth educator, advocate and Labor Support Doula I would recommend this book to all pregnant women. Early in pregnancy most people want to read about pregnancy, thinking they've got months to go to read up on birth issues. This book really should be read early. If you read nothing else, read this! BGMCS@AOL.com"
1,Very Out-Dated,If you want to confirm your beliefs about the benefits of natural childbirth then this book will do that but those looking for a neutral source of information will definately not find it here. Readers should be aware that this book is also very out of date (written in 1999). Many of the quoted literature is even older.
4,"Pen is great. Other things, not so much","Was dissapointed that the pen came with a black ink cartridge. The ad said the ink was blue. Also, the inner box had been opened and the presentation of this fine writing instrument had been compromised."
4,Dragons.....,I love dragons and this one is no exception. Perfect size for anyones collection or children (I have both). Enjoy!!
3,PLUSH DRAGON,THE DRAGON IS VERY SOFT AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE SHINY FUR. IT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN IT APPEARS IN THE PICTURE. IT WAS A GREAT GIFT. IT HAS A VERY CHILD-FRIENDLY FACE. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE WINGS WERE SEWN ON UPSIDE DOWN. SHE DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE SO I DIDN'T RETURN IT.
4,Cool Looking Case,"I bought this case primarily because I wanted to go with a retro look with my camera. Sure, I could have saved some cash and bought a cheaper case, but this has style. The case is well put together, and after a year of abuse it looks great, while more importantly protecting the camera. I still get a lot of comments on the look; people almost expect me to pull out some old fashioned camera."
2,Latch is not reliable,No one would argue that the latch on a camera case needs to be fail safe especially on location in difficult terrain where your camera can fall out of the case and tumble down a ravine. Recently on such a trip the latch on the camera case continually failed. Fortunately the camera did not fall out of the case but I was constantly having to re-latch the case.
2,No so secure,"I think the case lock is very bad, I feel it is going to open any time and the camera will fall. The material is great, but for 100 dollars I expected much more. I didn't buy the other choice of case for the Leica that you had because the review said it was a very large case for the camera, but I think This is worse. Also I live in Mexico and it was very difficult to purchase this item because you don't send them here."
3,"Admirable, but not Perfect","Though I have the greatest admiration for Ellman, I must say that this critical biography of Yeats has a few too many blindspots, is too vague and shapeless in its outline of Yeats' life, to satisfy entirely. Roy Foster's two-volume account is ultimately preferable because far more complete."
5,YOU EITHER GET IT OR YOU DON'T,"This record is a classic piece of dense, inspired, and very weird stoner rock. It's simply not easily categorizable in the vast sub-genres of heavy music. If you don't like your Sabbath crossed with a touch of Beefheart, if you can't fathom the fathomlessness, don't bother. These lines from ""Take A Shot At The Clown"" [a slower track which comes complete with a tune seemingly borrowed from some evil carousel] sum up the entire MOR ethic for me...""He prayed once to God, God gave him the nod...Just do what you do, we're laughing at you"". Spectacularly strange. You get it or you don't. Not for complainers."
4,"Like all MOR albums, this one is completely different.","OK, originally I hated this album. Hated it. It's really more like a Chris Goss solo album, since no other original Master is on it (besides a minimal contribution by Googe). The songs irritated me at first. I heard no hooks. It didn't grab me immediately like Sunrise or their first album (IMHO their best) did. I put it away for over a year. Then I listened to it again, and I was quite surprised what happened. This album ended up in my CD changer on heavy rotation. How did ""Calling Dr. Carrion"", which originally grated on my ears, suddenly become one of my favorites? I have no explanation. Chris Goss apparently knows which secret buttons to push deep in the channels of your mind, because this album is addictive. Now, if only a studio version of Jindalee Jindalie was on this disc..."
1,one page! Word count: 459.,charging 6 bucks for a one pageWord count: 459.should be on line somewhere and free...stupidI would have given it a 0 stars if I could
5,Origami Treasure Chest,Origami Treasure Chest is a real treasure. It contains easy to follow instructions and diagrams with illustrations of the finished origami models. It contains a variety of models with some variations for some of the models. The models are simple to intermediate. I recommend this book to origamists who want some easy models to create.
4,Value in the Handbook of Psychiatric Measures,"I purchased this book because of my studies in family therapy in particular family therapy with young clients who have a developing mental illness.This book will assist in clarifying issues and lead to a speedy resolution of their problems, and assist families in helping their family member in the recovery process"
4,sweet and funny,"Woody is used to being every girl's best friend. When he dares to like Kim, the new girl, he is ecstatic to find out that she likes him too, as more than a friend. When they start dating, Woody goes overboard with puppy love, and soon Kim is feeling smothered. She wants the old, fun-loving Woody, not this lovesick creature he's become. Will Woody lighten up before it's too late"
5,"This author hits it on the head, move forward!","Vicki Spina recently appeared on Oprah. Oprah said to buy the book. Buy this book. Spina is talking about how to get past the roadblocks and put your ideas in to action. She's coming at this from a front line perspective. Not a consultant who spends her day talking about doing, but somebody who has and continues to drive her destiny. She is doing.Easy to read, no technical jargon. It's not about turning your computer clocks ahead, it's about thinking like a 'futurist'.Great book to accompany her first, Getting Hired in the 90's. Once you understand workplace in both decades, you'll get it!"

3,An ok movie,"Pretty Good movie, though alittle boring. The students seemed to like it on the rainy day, but lost focus after awhile."
5,cool sailing DVD,"Cool action the sailing exciting and tense.The young crew sailed by them self with training, across the pacific.DVD worth the money and the book too."
4,These kids are terrific!,"What fun to see these college-age kids learn the ropes, so to speak, and do such a good job of racing the Pacific from CA to HI. Even if they didn't win, they are all winners."
5,Not just for sailors,"I have to disagree with the reviews that state this movie gets boring for non-sailors. I have a very little bit of sailing experience (none of it off-shore) and I thought it was great move. I enjoy sports in general and like watching the America's Cup, etc. but this is a film that, while it takes place on a sailboat, is not about sailing.This movie is about the struggle of a group of young people to take on a challenge of enormous size. While the movie left no doubt the people would succeed, at least to some degree, they didn't know if they would succeed while they were undertaking the challenge. The consequences of failure in the middle of the Pacific Ocean could easily be fatal.This film could be used as a study in leadership - in particular peer leadership. It is also very inspiring. I highly recommend the film."
2,Mass Market Paperback,"This is not a 'Paperback', rather a 'Mass Market Paperback', you know, the kind with small blurry print and lousy dark thin paper. It's still readable, but disappointing."
2,Fair,There was no mention that the dust cover was missing and that the print was a lot smaller than normal. It was a pretty hefty price to pay for not having all the information. We were disappointed when we received the book and saw what we got for the money we paid.
5,Francis' First Book was Great,I just finished Dead Cert. It is my first Francis novel. I must say that it was quite good. I love good mysteries and would put this near the top of my list.
5,Seagate ST3500641CB-RK 500 GB External Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire,Seagate ST3500641CB-RK 500 GB External Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWiredid not give me any trouble till now... works beautiful
5,Best external solution on the market,"Until recently I had relied on three external 500gb LaCie drives to manage my data and backups, but one by one they started failing - possibly due to Mac OS X Firewire issues, but unreliable nonetheless. I replaced two internal and two external drives with four of these new Seagate models, and they are incredible. A generous 5 year warranty (vs. 1yr for LaCie), beautiful, ergonomic form factor for the external versions (about half the size of the LaCie's) and QUIET! I do a lot of pro photo/video/music work and I live and die by the quality of my storage media. For every drive I have, I have an exact clone drive in case something goes wrong. I researched all the options and came to the conclusion that the newer Seagate models were the most reliable for the money. So far, I am extremely pleased with my volume purchase of these four drives!"
4,The Best Hard drive for the buck.,"I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well.using : Seagate 750GB, 500GB, 400GB. daisy chained...."
3,"lack of documentation, customer service","I think the drive works fine, but I had questions about performing backups and wasn't able to get a good response from customer service. I'll keep trying."
5,Board book look at a small part of the Lion King Musical!,"If you have a chance to see the musical of the Lion King... Run to see it! It is the most colorful and beautiful play! The costumes are spectaclar. But this play is not for young children 2 to 5 year olds, even those who love the movie. Wait until they are older to take them. In the meantime they can see a small slice of the play and feel like there where there with you! Again an awesome glimpse into the musical, and if you get the chance to see this play.. RUN TO IT!"
3,Local flavor adds to the enjoyment,"Jeri Howard is one of those ""believable"" characters - she has to work pretty hard to find her answers, and she doesn't often get the thrill and glamour of ""traditional"" PI's. The book's pace was moderate, most of the characters were well developed, their personalities grew as Jeri learned more about them. I think what I enjoyed most about the book, though, was the setting. I liked reading about the characters bobbing about in my neighborhood, and actually visualizing the areas they visit and drive through. I get the same pleasure from reading the Kat Colorado books, though I think Dawson is generally a better read."
4,TURNER AND DOUGLAS,"As film actress Georgia Lorrison, Lana Turner gives one of her best performances and Kirk Douglas is great as the cad, Jonathan Shields. This film won an amazing total of 6 AA; only the odd-mouthed Gloria Grahame (in a frivolous performance) won for an acting role. The paradoxical, corrupt and colourful world of Hollywood is given pretty honest treatment here and it's a fascinating excursion into what made the film capital tick back in the early 50's. Lana Turner surprised many when she showed just how far she could stretch her acting ability when well-directed. Cynical and hard with elements still revelent today, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL gives us an insightful look into the lives of users and abusers and it's most interesting to watch, for those in the mood."
5,Best Movie in Grand Tradition of Classic Hollywood Style I've Seen In A While,"WOW. Short review: Just watched it on VHS and got online immediately afterwards to order it on DVD. Not only that, this is the movie that's tempted me into finally making the plunge into Digital Projector purchase. This movie deserves to been seen on the biggest screen possible. The cast is fantastic, but hey, you already know that. Viva Minnelli!Oh, and this movie's also responsible for the first ever review I've written for Amazon. Cheers, GB"
3,It's dated.,Great if you're a Lana Turner fan.Good if you're not.I'm required to write nine more words: good movie.
4,"The original, and the better of the two","Although dated, this light-hearted comedy should prove to be entertaining to both fans and non-fans of baseball. Paul Douglas is excellent in his depiction of a fictional manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates (the cellar-dwellers of the early fifties)."
5,Wonderful movie - understand why Ike liked it,Definately worth watching - better than remake - watched it after reading Ike's Bluff Had seen remake and it was only OK
5,Angels in the Outfield classic,"Great movie, now that my daughter is in college in Pittsburgh, the movie makes more sense. Pittsburgh Pirates losing streak was somewhat based on this movie story line."
3,"Original 1951 ""Angels in the Outfield""","The VHS I purchased arrived in a timely manner & was in excellent condition, as promoted. y wife & I totally enjoyed viewing it."
2,Boring -- but a classic,"This is a common text for many introductory anthropology courses. It's apparently a classic ethnographic work, but honestly one of the most boring books I think I have ever read."
4,Everything`s Fine!,"Alanis` first single off her recent album ""So-Called Chaos"" is really great. It`s not as catchy as some of her earlier singles like ""Ironic"", ""Thank U"" or ""Hands Clean"", so at first it may not seem that interesting; but very soon it will grow on you; especially if you are already a fan of Alanis` particular style.""Precious Illusion"" ,which was also a single from her previous album, is featured in an alternate more quiet version; great song."
4,Historical Backroad Reference,"For those avid history buffs this is a great book to start with for the ghost towns of the Kootenay's. This 110 pg book encompasses 50 stories of towns and has great black and white photo's from the archives incorporated so as you are touring the sites listed you can see what it used to look like in its hey day. The stories include those from the southwest border of BC at Cascade City to the east at Creston and up north towards Trout Lake and North Arrow Lake past Halycon Hot Springs, and easterly towards Kaslo and ArgentaWe found this a great resource as we do lots of back road travelling and this helped fill in the story gaps for some of the rundown buildings we came across in the area."
5,Great Hydration for the face without the oily feeling!,"I first came across Lancome Hydra Intense in a free gift with purchase and immediately fell in love! It doesn't feel like a lotion, but leaves your face feeling moisturized and refreshed! Better yet, I notice a visible difference in my skin!"
5,This Cheese Doesn't Stink,"this is the recording that jobim created when the bossa nova rush first hit the states in the early 60s. considering he was the master of bossa nova composition (writing them that is), it makes sense that he was equally talented at playing and recording. honestly, his playing probably won't blow you away, but his finesse and timing probably will. he's so quiet. the whole recording is quiet. it's beautifully done. while this recording is easy listening cheese, thanks in part to creed taylor's insanely sappy production and claus ogerman's overly lush samba orchestration, it's completely enjoyable either as cocktail party background music, rainy day sleep music or for simple relaxation. although you wouldn't be surprised if you heard it playing on your parents phonograph or in an elevator downtown, it is still a brilliant release."
1,Hold the strings Claus - please!,"Love Jobim, like violins but the two together? Well let's just say it's not a marriage made in heaven. Perhaps the album should have been subtitled Jobim goes `70's mainstream. Claus Ogerman, arranger and conductor, brings a load of Montovanni to Jobim that he definitely could do without. Which is to say it destroys the Samba experience for me. The Verve guys are breathing really heavily over this album. It is actually the worst Jobim album I've heard. Bummer!! But if you dig violins, violas and cellos with your Samba - then this is the disc for you."
5,Smooth Bossa Nova,"In 1965 the Bossa Nova was just blossoming. I was an eighteen year old, doe eyed teen and hopelessly romantic. This album sets a mood like no other! I had lost my 331/3 rpm years ago and have been searching for this everywhere. Alas! I have it again in this beautiful re-master. You cant go wrong here if you love a slow romantic, bosa nova. It is truly a classic of the 60's."
4,DJC mini case,"It's good stuff for the most part. It's... cute (for the lack of a better word). One thing I really liked about it, was that it came with the patch cables and the power supply. One thing I don't like about it is that it is designed to fit only Mini Dan pedals, so say like a WAH, I'd have to have on the outside of it, on the floor; thus, having to carry one more bag with cables and all the extra stuff.Considering I had a few of the little pedals and a good friend who let me have some others, it's a good case to have. Bang for the buck type thing."
4,slightly disapointing but good for the price.,this game is a lot of fun if you just want to fly around and shoot stuff. but the story line is basicly all the series so if your a trek fan its really predictable. but with the skirmish mode is a lot of fun if you really do just want to fly around and shoot stuff. at first i wasn't going to buy legacy but this game didn't quite quench my thirst so this game is definetly just to hold us over.
2,Cheap game but good reason for that,This game is cheap so you can't expect anything too flashy. The ship you control is very small and controls are not intuitive. Can be fun in skirmish mode but if you do the missions its a bit of a chore. There is a stupid section at the start where you fly through rings which is almost impossible. Overall not recommended.
2,nothing special,"Was looking for another game and this was suggested. Looked alright. Was fun for a week but too easy, not much fighting, and you do the same thing over and over in each mission. Didn't do much multiplayer."
1,Just.. DONT!,"I love star trek, I grew up watching it.But this game just SUCKED! The levels grind on you, and I was so bored at points that I fell asleep! The controls where hard to understand.The ships where 'ok' but in an over-all it could have been so much better. The only good points in this game where you got phasers and torpedoes. which you can get in any start trek game really.So my advice. RENT the thing first before you fork over some hard earned cash."
1,playstation 2 games,"This is a blue disk and will not play on our playstation 2, the game was new, and it was no ones fault, the game store said blue disk do not play on older playstation II consoles."
2,"Maybe someone likes this game, but not me","If you could take all the excitment of controlling a powerful starship on the edge of human knowledge and put it into a video game... it would be the oposite of this.I gave up on this game after the second level of ""fly the ship to the destination points in time""...LAME.Maybe I'm missing something, but I did not enjoy this game."
4,Sweet!,This game has so many good things going for it. One of my favorite is the two dimensional three dimensions. Rather than making the game three dimensional where it is hard to orient oneself on a small screen they made the game two dimensional but with three planes. So while there are still three dimensions you get the ease of use of two dimensions!I would recommend this one much more than it's upgrade Star Trek: Conquest since it has more ships and has creative challenges.
2,Star Trek Encounters OK,Star Trek Encounters game was fun to play since it also had two-player capability. I did not like the fact I could not save at key points but it did let you go back if you lost. OK not the best but more fun in two-player mode.
2,User inface causes great pain,"I played this game for a few hours and the awkward controls sent me to bed that night with a numb arm and outrageous pain in my shoulder. I thought maybe it was something else, and tried again.... This game looks nice, but is actually a Klingon Pain Stick cleverly disguised as a video game.I had no choice but to stop playing and throw it away. It was either that or end up in doctor's office. REALLY too bad, I was very, very much looking forward to a good Star Trek based PS2 game but sadly this was not it."
1,star drek encounters,"Hard to see obstacles. Hard to maneuver ships. Very difficult to pass entry level tests, and when you fail, you have to really go far back to get back to where you started. My 10 year old son and I give this a big fat F."
3,I Hope This Is A Fun Game,"I bought this game when it came out and have yet to see what the actual story mode game is like. The reason is that I can not for the life of me get past the first level with the rings! I have tried several times and have given myself carpal tunnel syndrome trying to get past it. Even my brother and his girlfriend took several turns to beat it.You have to fly the ship through the rings and you are timed, and I never beat it. I feel like such a video game loser! Does anyone know any kind of cheat code for this?"
1,Blue disc on this game doesn't work!!!,"I played this game a total of 3 times and this game kept coming up ""Bad disc error"" or something like that. I already returned it once and it's going back again, apparently I'm not the only one having this problem. Bethesda really screwed up on this one!."
5,Great game,"A must have for any and every trekkie. I absolutely love this game. When I first started playing, I was disappointed because it looked like you could only play from the perspective of the Enterprise crew (Archer). But I was mistaken, you can fly ships from whichever series you would like: TOS (Constitution), TNG (Galaxy), DS9 (haven't tried this yet), Voyager (Intrepid), Enterprise (NX), and Sovereign (which I never did end up playing but I'm assuming you fly a Sovereign class starship--Star Trek First contact).You can do single player missions, which can be a hair tedious. Or you can grab a friend to fight against AI or go head-to-head."
2,Both games were rushed!,"To rate Star Trek Encounters is real simple;I paided $15 for it,you get what you pay for.Its ok for a quick game of shoot'em up,but like the reviews for its big brother(Star Trek Legacy),developer should spent more time instead of try to put it out for the holidays.Hoping for a sequel,and maybe hopefully they'll do it GTA style(open space,do what you want to do),and just focus on one era(TOS,TNG,DS9,VOY,and ENT)."
3,"A value title, and it shows","While Bethesda has been working on the Star Trek franchise for some time, this was the first game to come out of the gate. It is not a great game, but it is a fun game for the value price. The control scheme is complicated and sometimes requires some dexterity, but it can be overcome.Stuff blows up real nice in this game, and the onslaught mode needs to allow you to play the alien races' ships, but for just flying around blowing up stuff with starships, this is a good fun romp."
1,Would be good if I could play this,I actually purchased this twice and had to return it twice. I could not get it to play on my unit. I checked on Bethesda website I found several posts in there discussions section about the same thing. It apparently has something to do with it being on a blue disk instead of a dvd so the company could save money.If anyone else out there has had the same problem let us know.
3,Quick Play Game,"Star Trek Encounters isn't exactly a fantastic game, but it is a nice quick play game if you aren't a hardcore gamer. I bought this game for cheap for xmas as I still only have PS2 - I don't have much time to play a lot of games these days. It is easy to learn, and if you are a fan of the ships of star trek, it is fun as you get to play as a wide variety of non-Federation ships. Most importantly though you Do get to play as all of the Enterprises from each of the TV shows and the Enterprise E from STNG movies. The basic premise of the game is you take control of the ships and conduct various missions using the various abilities of your ship such as phasers, photons, tractor beam, mines, etc. The graphics are OK, not great, but hey it is PS2.If you get a good price, it is a fun game that can probably be beat in two days."
1,boring,"READ REVIEW BEFORE BUYING, THIS GAME IS SLOW, AND A LITTLE BORING, INTERESTING BECAUSE OF THE CONCEPT BEING STAR TREK BUT SLOW,,"
3,I've had better...,"Since I have played Starfleet Command I, II, III, Starfleet Academy, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Bridge Commander (in my opinion the best trek game to date), I was disappointed by Encounters.The game is VERY topical, as in you get a Cliff Notes version of the Star Trek Universe. The only character voice you hear is that of William Shatner, beyond that there is no crew involvement of any kind in the game. The battles are very fast paced, with enemies that seem more like fighter jets compared to a dreadnought. If you wana take out some frustration and blow some things up in a famous trek ship go at it!if you want a serious Trek game with a real story and depth, dont choose this one!"
3,Encounters,Star Trek EncountersI didn't get a chance to play it much but it seems challenging enough and the shipping didn't take to long
3,Controls a bit tricky,"I like that the game includes all the incarnations of the Star Trek series and it is fun to play, but the controls seemed a bit complicated. I felt like I needed two extra fingers on each hand in order to lock weapons onto a target while running the engines and flying the ship. The overly complicated controls make it harder to progress and unlock my favorite Star Trek series."
1,Film winding does not work,"I read the reviews of this camera before buying it and I had hoped that the ones about the film winding system not working properly were wrong. However, after taking less than 10 rolls of film with the camera the film got stuck inside and would not wind. I took out that roll and tried other rolls that also got stuck in the camera. I e-mailed Kodak and asked for a refund and they said that they could only send me a replacement. I really don't want a replacement if there is a good possibility that it won't work because of poor design."
1,Unhappy Customer,"I bought my camera the latter part of 2002. It is the Kodak Easy Load 35mm camera. I am very unhappy with it. I have not used it a dozen times yet. So,it is still new. I use the same kind of film everytime that I use the camera. The film is stuck in the camera and will not come out. This would not be a problem except the pictures that I have on the roll are the people that I have worked with for 12 yrs and our company is closing. I will NEVER buy another camera from you. I am so disgusted and upset that I have lost valuable pictures."
1,2nd KE 60 froze & won't rewind,"Camera takes great photos...however..after taking only 1 roll successfully, on TWO seperate cameras...they BOTH froze up and would not let me rewind the film. I do not want a 3rd. Want a replacement. Not good for when taking photo's on a once-in-a-lifetime trip."
1,Don't buy it,After 3 rolls of film the automatic lens cap stopped openning automatically. The only way to know it doesn't open is when you get your film back and they are all blank.Buy something else.
2,Only Good For a Short Time,"I purchased this camera at the end of 2004 because the price was unbeatable. The place was trying to get rid of its 35mm cameras to make room for new digital cameras. At first, I was totally pleased with the quality of the pictures and the easy loading of the film. However, after only 2 uses the camera began to malfunction. When I try to load the film now, it won't accept it and the display on the back of the camera won't stop flashing. I can turn the camera off but once I turn it back on, the display on the back continues to flash, not allowing me to do anything at all. Glad I didn't pay the actual retail price for this camera. I was terribly disappointed because the first set of photos I took came out unbelievably beautiful. I woudn't recommend this camera at all."
3,Good Camera gone Bad,This camera was fine and it took really good pictures and they came out well. But then the camera's battery went dead and the camera was jammed in the middle of rewinding then I finally got the film out but it all out and every picture I took was ruined. Then when I put a new roll in the camera the film went all the to the end of the so I couldn't use it again.
1,A Total Flop,"Being a fan of Karajan's craftsmanship, I was very disappointed with this release. The sound is heavily compressed, with very little dynamic contrast. The picture quality is poor (barely TV-broadcast quality) and betrays its age. Camera-work is directed by Karajan himself, and is distracting in its choice of how much of the orchestra to reveal at a given time, and also makes use of odd, changing-color backlighting. The performance is stodgy, and too heavy for its own good, and the orchestral playing is sluggish and uninspired. Because the production centers around trying to emphasize Karajan's mastery in a mock-heroic way, the juxtaposition between the posturing and the performance is laughable. Truly a waste of my money for this contrived performance of Berlioz. I will stick to my audio recording of the Cleveland Orchestra with Boulez."
2,closer to 1 star if it wasnt for the pumpkin scene!,"Yea, it was pretty bad, dumb, generic. Only good points, it was dark, had mild creepy aspects about it, and the pumpkin child scene was pretty nasty, I gave it an extra star for that, that was cooL! barely worth a rental, have seen worse though, also seen a million better"
3,If you like B movies you'll love this.,"Ok I really had a good time with this movie, who are you folks that think this would be high art? The name, the box art and everything about this flick say's grade B movie, why in the hell would you think it would be a block buster?This is a blast with a very original story and a cool cast of bone headed guys.My only real complaint is the minimal amount of T.& A.If you like B movies like I do this is the top of the pile and you can buy it used for less then you can rent it."
1,Full Moon... Fall From Grace.,"Full Moon used to produce some top quality films from great director's such as Stewart Gordon and the like. Unfortunatly from about Puppet Master 4 onward, things have been looking VERY grim. The quality in there films have taken a drastic turn, apparently due to lack of funds......or cut backs in order to increase profits, who knows. What evert he reason, they can't seem to find a decent actors, directors, FX crews, Costume Managers, etc. For ANY of there films. I swear you can buy half there props and costumes at about any arts and craft store.This movie sux, and not in a good way like Bad Taste, it's not so dumb and crappy it is funny, NOTHING!!!Well except for the naked old lady, that in itself is worth the rental, infact if they would cut out the rest of the film save for that one scene, I'd say it would be worth buying."
2,Yuck!,"Hated it. Don't need to say much more. If you like ultra-low budget movies with bad acting, then you might like it. To me it had no redeeming values."
3,BEST TEMPE VIDEO I HAVE SEEN TO DATE,"This is one of the better Tempe videos, which is like saying it it one of the better Japanese syfy films.Three young men get into a tussle with a witch and her son. Things escalate to a point to where ghouls are involved. The surviving man gets help from a stripper named Rose, who is also a part time witch.The acting, plot, dialouge and sound track are far better than most of the Tempe videos out there. If you can't stomach this low budget gem, don't bother to ever watch another Tempe film...they get worse.Nudity."
3,dead and rotting,"hmm another full moon pictures film. well it's definitely better than hell asylum. definitely worth 3 stars though, pretty entertaining film with good special f/x. zombies were very nicely done and a pretty good storyline. nothing great but a real good film for full moon. definitely worth checking out, has some pretty funny moments in it also."
3,Coconut cookie bar,This is my least favorite bar in the SoyJoy line only because I'm not a big coconut flakes fan though.
2,Were's the bar,"This bar is advertised as a 1.6 oz. bar, it's a 1.06 oz. bar. big differance. The tast is ok, but it is to small."
3,Similar to a bar cookie,"They were passing out samples of these the other day and so I took one and brought it home to try.It looks like a bar cookie, browned on one side, and smells sweet and fruity. It tastes a little bit like a cross between a cookie and bread pudding with coconut flavor while the papaya, mango and pineapple combine to taste just about like dried apricot to me. The flavor combination is not bad at all. I wouldn't guess that it had soy in it instead of another type of flour and the texture isn't bad, just the right amount of chewiness.However, the bar is fairly small and a little dry so I probably won't be buying any. People who like this sort of snack or have some special reason to choose them like avoiding wheat products will probably enjoy them. If I were offered other flavors to try I would taste them so my rating is neutral."
3,quality not as good as last time order?,may need to find a different sock...the quality of these socks was better last time ordered...about nine months ago? socks have a thinner cushion and poorer construction... almost feel like seconds or even thirds...not the top quality I expected
4,Thorlo Running Mini-Crew sock,"This mini-crew is a must for runners of any level. It's lightweight, offers great fit, and provides great cushion for almost any shoe, running on almost any surface."
2,Not really what I was looking for,I typically use a more streamlined sock. This one came off as way too cushioned and didn't breathe well at all. My foot was wet and full of fuzzies. It would be a decent winter running sock.
1,DOA + False advertising,"Left channel speaker crackled from first use. Also, Pyle advertises speakers as being 20W x 2. Um, the input power is 4W for the whole system. I'm a creative electrical engineer, but I can't imagine how to create 40W out of 4W."
3,"Bukowski's first published work, and it shows","I have read four or five Bukowski novels, and I absolutely loved them. So naturally I was really looking forward to this book. However, from reading this book, it really showed that this was his first novel. Its not bad, its just that his other poetry books read a lot differently, and those are the ones I loved."
4,"Obviously good, but not great","This book of poems is good, there are some great pieces in here, but on the whole i was a bit disappointed, in that it didn't have the kind of impact that something like Burning in Water Drowning in Flame did. I would pass this over unless you are an avid Bukowski fan and try something else."
4,Good Stuff,"Typical Buk poetry, which for most is superior stuff. Not as good in my opinion as Play the Piano... but an excellent collection. If you're just starting out on Bukowski and like his writing, he also writes some cool fiction."
4,Worked for me,"I used these for my '01 Mitsu Gallant. It idles much smoother now and gets a bit better mileage, but there was no major performance difference (I really didn't expect one, either, for an older car) I'm not really a car guy, but NGK was very highly recommended by a buddy of mine who is, for what it's worth."
5,Arthur the Dogs Stinky Kat Mitts,"This is a great product. My cat doesn't seem to mind ""bathing"" with these pre-moistened mitts. Customer service is fast and courteous, too."
4,WORKS WELL,"i used it to put over a broken vent on my trailer. it was much easier than drilling out all the rivets on the old crank up vent and risking a water leak. it was a breeze to install. it is a bit bulky, but what the heck."
3,Inexpensive but very fragile,"I like the shape of the cover, the vent lid opens sufficiently and it passes enough air, however, the cover hinges broke when I lifted it during the installation (they have cracks along the lap that hooks into the slots). I used nylon straps to strengthen the hinges. My rating is based on price and design discounted because it is so fragile."
2,Idea is good,The thought behind the vent cover is good...I have had vent covers on my last 3 rv's..This one though turned out to be weakly made..Rear hinges broke while I was trying to mount top half...(made of plastic)...the screw hole that holds the front of the cover down had the threads missing...and last but not least your rv vent cover does not go all the way up...Also darkens the inside of the camper...Have not taken it out on the road yet to see how it holds up traveling..Don't have much hope for long life..
3,"Decent product, but didn't last long.","I installed two of these about 4-5 years ago. Yesterday I was doing some maintenance on the roof and opened one of these covers to clean inside. The plastic on the side clips looks completely pitted and fragile and about to break. I carefully opened it, cleaned, then when I closed it, I put very slight pressure on the main top and it cracked very easily. The plastic is also VERY crumbly and just lightly rubbing my palm over the surface created plastic dust as it deteriorated in front of me.Now, to be fair, my trailer has been in the CA sun for at least 3 of those years, so maybe these don't do well in constant sun? I don't know, but all I know is now I have to buy a new one, possibly two, I didn't clean the other one yet.So I guess these were good for 4 years, but plan on replacing them if you live in a sunny climate at about 5 years. I am researching now, and may go with the MaxxAir brand as replacements."
2,disappointing,The top came with several deep scratches across the top. The plastic hinge is cheap and I suspect it will break within a year or two.
5,Fatten your wallet and have fun,"This is an outstanding book. Easy to read, well-written, and chock full of level-headed advice for investing, particularly in these perilous times. This book will save you the cover price in your first foray into the market by helping you to avoid costly mistakes. It offers invaluable and solid advice on investing. These days bookshelves are crowded with ""make a quick killing in the market"" and other uninformed fuzzy investment books, and TV cluttered with unrealistic shows touting the latest investing technique. While those merely capitalize on a passing fad, this is the real thing."
4,Smith changes his style up a little,"Unlike his other jazz albums, Smith decides to break away from the usual pattern and play the blues, as well as accompany his music with singing. Now some of the songs on this album are great jazz interpretations, I really liked Satisfaction, One Mint Julep, and C Jam Blues, but a lot of these songs just break too far away from Smith's familiar pattern that made him the jazz legend that he is. Sure he provides some good organ riffs off these blues tunes but Jimmy Smith ventures too far into the Blues that this is a little bit of a stretch. Of course I think the best song on this was T.N.T. which is a cool sounding jazz piece accompanied by a band. This is not a bad album by all means, it is still great and has many good songs, but is not a 5 star album because it isn't as groundbreaking or funky as his other albums, but Smith still could play the blues and his singing isn't too bad, but for jazz, this is just 4 star material."
2,a mediocre CD by a jazz/funk great,"However talented Jimmy Smith may be, it does not make up for the the arrangements on this album. There are a few quality songs, but most feature Smith's organ playing atop of corny big band arrangements. If one is interested in Jimmy Smith, I would recommend either The sermon or Back at the Chicken Shack over this album."
4,Both books in very good shape,"They have great service and quick delivery. Books in very good shape - no pages marked. As in the other remarks, I was able to finish the series."
5,Awesome book,"This is a really great book, with the Glorious Appearing being the coolest. I've read it about four times in bookstores, and it never ceases to thrill me. As for what Mark Moore says, he is describing Christianity like it is: but from a negative point of view. The Bible is not a myth. Anyway, this is a good book, and I think it would be cool if they made another series about the temporary release of Satan and the rebellion.In Christ,"
3,Decent,"This is a decent and relatively flexible fast b&w with horrible tonal range. There is not enough detail in highlights or shadows with this film as compared to Ilford and other company's offerings. It is all around just not very impressive. Yes, it is true that it is can be pushed, pulled and do the hokey pokey, but whatever you use it for, the negatives produced are flat and without the kind of range that other 400 speed 35mm b&w films are capable of. It is also not the most flexible film in its category. While some companies are continually improving their film and paper products, Kodak is apparently content to offer the same poor quality film they've been offering for at least 10 years now."
4,Same as Coleman Hawkins encounters Ben Webster,"I had to read the reviews numerous times and keep my disappointment in check at the limited availability of what seemed to be a classic summit.Then I compared the notes about the personnel and the tracks to realize that this is the same album Coleman Hawkins encounters Ben Webster (which is readily available here on Amazon and elsewhere).Great disc, well worth picking up."
5,Fabulous!,This is one of the greatest recordings of all time. What a collaboration between 2 absolute geniuses of the tenor. Also Oscar Peterson's playing is awsome on every cut. I can't stop listening to this. It is inspiring!
3,Love the no Jockey No Panty Line Brand,"Don't buy the ones with ""modal"" though, they take too long to dry and tend to ball up. I buy the ones with tactel (I think that's what it's called). I've been wearing these for years. I don't put them in the dryer, I hang them dry. The string bikini cut is hard to find--have to order online or go to an outlet store. I'm not a thong underwear kind of person so this is the next best thing."
2,You can do better,"If you want a book that lays a guilt trip on you because you feed your puppy anything less than holistic food (that you can nibble on yourself in an emergency!)or because you allow your baby to play satanic tug-of-war or wrestling games, then you might like this book, but I doubt that you'll like your puppy. I'm a new puppy owner, and found much in here frustrating -- she doesn't talk much about crate training, for instance, because it makes her cry to see a dog in a cage, so she suggests you just tie your pup to yourself all day. Do yourself a favor: the information in How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live With is far more helpful and complete, and the writing in The Art of Raising a Puppy is far more readable and enlightening. I can't vouch for the other puppy books, but the two books I mentioned are worth your time and money; this one is, well, for dummies."
3,Okay book. Okay suggestions.,"I think of this book as more of a reference manual than a how-to but it can work as both. While I didn't agree with all the methods it did bring up some new ideas that I had not heard of before. It's a handy book for observing a certain behavior in your puppy and finding a subject that address that behavior. However, this should not be your only puppy book. I haven't found one book I like for all stages of puppyhood, and I have purchased several. But this one is worth getting. It's deeper than many ""Dummies"" books. It doesn't assume that you are a dummy. However it does tend to be a bit too opinionated. Obviously there are different ways to raise a dog. This takes one path. I was willing to accept that path since it was not my only source on the subject. But if you want to buy just one book, look elsewhere."
1,unrealistic,"While it would be great to feed my puppy only holistic dog food, keep him tied to me all day long, and not take him for car rides or leave him alone until he was an adult, it is completely unrealistic. I don't want to raise a spoiled dog, but I plan on playing tug-of-war with him on occasion and even hugging and kissing him before I leave him for the afternoon, against this book's advice. The author also only touches upon some of the most important and basic training info I was searching for by buying this book. Save your money!"
1,Grab yourself by the neck and RUB YOUR NOSE in this book,"I didn't buy this book for a ""sit down and read, cover to cover,"" experience. Rather, I wanted it as a ""skim, then use as a reference"" book.Goals were to (1) pick up the basics of introducing a puppy into a house with small children, (2) setting the foundation to have the family puppy grow into a reasonably well-adapted dog, and (3) picking up some ""tricks and tips"" that might make some of the harder aspects of bringing a puppy into the family a little easier. You know... maybe some effective tips that will allow me more sleep at night without sacrificing the puppy's bladder or my carpet.Unfortunately, there's nothing helpful or successful that I can report to you on any of those three topics. I could give some examples of how it lacked information or provided tips that didn't work, but that's just going to drag out the review. I don't like giving negative reviews.If your goals are similar to mine, this is not the book for you."
2,Not that good.,"I'm not sure what I expected. Well, yes I am. I expected more specific training techniques. This is more about choosing the right puppy and getting ready for it. We already had our puppy and needed help that this book didn't give. We found better training techniques for free on You Tube."
1,Poor pictures,"This book is quite an disappointment for me!The pictures are black-white with mediocre quality,and unable to cover some important developmental stages.Not worthy to buy it."
1,I do not recommend,This is an extremely poor quality atlas of embryology. I was very disappointed with it.
4,Fygi Legrand takes lush and loving,"Laura Fygi has again recorded another superb disc. Her voice and accompaniment are first-rate, thought her song selection could have been better. Yentl hit ""The Way He Makes Me Feel,"" which is so Streisand, is out of place as is ""How Do You Keep the Music Playing."" Legrand has better tunes to choose from. But through it all, Fygi remains true to her form and delivers another nice showcase of tunes. Though this CD is not up the stuff of her earlier takes ""Girl Talk"" and ""The Girl Wants to Know."""
3,A safe approach,Highly professional but very predictable. Good background material but you'll never be uplifted by this CD. Laura Fygi seems out of her comfort zone.
2,Laura sure has a sweet voice and more,"This will be the first Laura Fygi cd for me to buy. I pretty much knew what to expet from her, because I had heard her songs played on the radio a lot. Lauras' voice has sure been everything I had hoped for.L.F. has a very pleasent and smooth voice. I never seems to loose it balance and texture. I guess you could say that she has the voice of an ANGEL. It is one that will please most music fans.The only draw back to this cd was the song selection. She sang Michel Legrand songs which I thought was ok, but I never felt like he had that many hits that I truley liked. As far a Lauras' voice goes it is definately a ""ten"".Recommendation: I think this will be a cd that you can enjoy."
3,The Gift,"Thorton and Epperson serve up another helping of Southern Gothic, forming the third installment of a trilogy of sorts along with ONE FALSE MOVE and SLINGBLADE. Where these two movies benefitted from production as smallish, independent features, THE GIFT suffers as a result of going too Hollywood, trying to heap star power onto the movie. The result is that the authentic small-town feel of the earlier films is absent from THE GIFT. The story itself is suspenseful enough to make it an interesting watch, even if it is a fairly standard-issue thriller plot, and may remind you of several movies you've seen recently (I can't tell you which without tipping you off to THE GIFT's ending). Blanchett gives the most compelling performance in the film."
2,"MOVIE GOOD, DISC NOT","THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE MOVIE SO MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE AND WANTED IT FOR MY PERSONAL LIBRARY. I DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO VIEW IT RIGHT AWAY DUE TO THE FACT I TAKE CARE OF 3 LITTLE ONES AND DONT HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS BEFORE. WHEN I DID GET THE CHANCE, I WAS DISAPPOINTED, NOT IN THE MOVIE( IT'S GREAT, THE PERFORMANCE BY CATE BLANCHETT IS EXCELLENT) BUT THE DISC KEPT FREEZING UP.NOW I AM SOMEWHAT LEARY ABOUT PURCHASING ANOTHER. I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO SEND THINGS BACK SO I WIND UP JUST TOSSING THEM. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THIS MOVIE FOR YOURSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE, TAKE HEED AND CHECK IT AS SOON AS YOU GET IT TO MAKE SURE YOU DONT GET A BAD DISC. AS FOR ME, LIVE AND LEARN!"
3,It's Okay,It was kind of interesting but in the end it was not anything new or groundbreaking. Cate Blanchett made it tolerable with her great acting gift.
3,Tell me again. Where did Cate's salvation come from?,"This odd and unsatisfying movie concerns a young widow (Cate Blanchett) trying to scratch a living for herself and her children in a small country town. The most she has to rely on is her gift. Sometimes she has visions that foretell things. The townspeople call her a fortuneteller. Then one day the promiscuous wife of the school superintendent disappears. Before long she has a vision. Violence erupts, secrets are exposed, townspeople are affected.The murder mystery is not bad. Cate Blanchett is just fine. But the movie tries too hard, with too many overly dramatic subplots. The ending is one of those cheats that is supposed to leave the audience scratching their heads."
5,Great movie,all the stars worked together! not boring at all. Again i passed this movie to the rest of my friends...they also loved it!
3,"Ok Movie, with 2 redeeming features!","The movie was interesting,Cate Blanchett was good as always and Keanu was actually believeable for once!The story was good and suspenseful but I thought the last 20 minutes or so lost me and the murderer was pretty obvious by then and I was past caring anyway.What I really liked about the movie was seeing Katie Holmes breasts ,they are beautiful and while she has very little acting ability i did appreciate seeing them ."
2,Scooby Doo,"In a movie with a limited number of characters and a ""bad guy""to spot, it always ends up like an episode of Scooby Doo -""It's Mr Jones, the caretaker!"". Why? Because he is the ONLYother person there except Shaggy, Fred, Wilma and Daphne!Just like in this movie. Three principal suspects just makesthis movie an episode of Scooby Doo - albeit with some swearing,blood and naked people.Cate is wonderful, but the film is wholly lacking in suspenseof any kind. A little random violence and some ""Boo!"" typescares does not make for a satisfying film - as a supernaturalthriller or indeed as any kind of a thriller.Oh and the direction by Mr Raimi? That would be with a trowel."
2,It's a real gift if you have trouble sleeping,"Advertised as a paranormal murder mystery ""The Gift"" fails at forming any type of suspense with a shockingly predictable story. Cate Blanchett, so wonderful in Elizabeth, cannot save this awful movie. If you are a Katie Holmes fan, you may want to rent this movie just to see her topless (it's near the end). If you are a particular fan of any of the other actors, it might be worth your while, but the painfully slow and predictable storyline will likely put you to sleep."
5,Classic!,"Cate Blanchwtt and Giovanni Ribisi are at there best. Extremely interesting and unique story of ""who done it"". Have not met anyone who didn't enjoy this movie yet."
5,Visions And Portents...,"Small town psychic reader, Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett from the Lord Of The Rings trilogy) finds herself caught up in the storm caused by the disappearance of a young woman (Katie Holmes), her impossibly nice fiancé (Greg Kinnear), a wife-beater and his victim (Keanu Reaves and Hilary Swank), and a mentally ill tow-truck driver (Giovanni Ribisi). Annie is the central figure, using her gift to help the police locate the missing girl. Unfortunately, nothing is as it seems, and everyone's a suspect! THE GIFT is another solid thriller from director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Darkman, A Simple Plan). He's got quite an ensemble to work with here. I love the entire cast, but Ribisi's character is my favorite. He is somehow endearing and frightening at the same time. If you are a mystery / thriller / horror fanatic, then this one will satisfy. Highly recommended..."
4,This one keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"Great acting, great cast, my kind of movie.... suspense and drama.... great combination...kept my interest and I would recommend this movie to many others!"
5,In a small town.,"The Gift starring the striking and extremely talented Cate Blanchett, is a thrilling murder mystery. First of all, what a great all-star cast, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank, Giovanni Ribsi, and Greg Kinnear. Blanchett plays Annie, a fortune teller. She has two boys and she is a widow, her ""gift"" is put to the ultimate test after a wealthy but sexually promiscuous woman (Holmes) is brutually murdered but who was she murdered by? Annie must uncover the awful truth and she makes some enemies along the way especially the locals who think she's a witch. This movie was co-written by Billy Bob Thorton, sometimes you forget what a talented man he really is. I highly recommend Checking The Gift out. Beautiful location, great southern story, and a fabulous ending. Enjoy!"
2,"Blue Diamonds, Yellow Clovers, Pink Moons...",It's more fun staring at a box of Lucky Charms than watching this movie. At least Cate Blanchett looks much hotter in this movie than in others she's been in.
1,Weak in comparison.........,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this ""psychic"" drama. Sam Raimi did direct the groundbreaking 'horror' series ""Evil Dead"". I expected more from him. The highly profiled actors in this flick could not save this bomb. If you want to see a drama that takes you to another time and draws you deeper into the backwoods life though the eyes of a psychic.....run to your DVD store and rent or purchase....""Eve's Bayou"". ""The Gift"" was pale in comparison."
4,Gift was a gift,"The Gift was an enjoyable film, fine acting, and more in depth than I expected. It arrived on time and in good condition, as usual."
4,Excellent Mystery Thriller,"In this suspenseful story set in a small southern town, a widowed mother of 2 played by Cate Blanchett gets caught in the midst of a murder mystery, which unfolds with the guidance of her psychic ""gift."" The story was co-written by Billy-Bob Thornton, and director Raimi has cast a superb ensemble of actors, including Blanchett, Hillary Swank, Greg Kinnear, Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi, & Katie Holmes. This paranormal thriller is spine-tingling in places, but ultimately has a warm compassionate foundation that speaks of universal human emotional needs that all the characters must cope with."
3,What Lies Beneath in the South,If you have seen Harrison Ford's movie What Lies Beneath you have seen this movie. The plot has several twists and you will be guessing 'witch' psycho did it till the end.Worth watching then trade it back in.
2,I own this disc for one reason....Cate!!!,"Im in love w/Cate Blanchett..their I said it. So thats why im foolish enough to purchase a film Im really not that fond of. She is gorgous in it and gives an amazing preformance. Those two things are about the only good things that can be said about this mediocre film.One look at the discs cover art(wich by the way isnt nearly as good as the films theatrical poster)and you are bombarded with images of a stellar cast. But unfortunately even a cast of this callaber cant overcome a prredictable plot, and heavy handed uninspired direction. Good preformances all around (especialy Keanu and Giavani) make the film bearable. And Cate is stunning, she sells the movie.So this is a rental most definately...I say that only because you really only need to view this once. That is unless your a Cate fanatic like yours truely :)"
4,"3 stars for the movie, 1 extra star for Katie","The movie is so full of great stars - Cate, Keanu, Hilary, Katie.... Cate is as usual a very fine performer. But I don't think Keanu is believable as the bad husband. He is not a bad actor he is more suitable as Neo, someone more heroic.About the director - Sam Raimi is not a great (but not bad) director - to me. Spider-man is just so-so. Evil Dead is just okay, compare to many horror classics. So, it is not a surprise that I find the movie is just a okay movie. The most enjoyable part is to see the acting of the fine casts. You may have already realized from other reviews that the story is very predictable, and I agree very much with that.Finally, I will give one extra star for Katie Holmes, for her stunning beauty, and her first-time nudity on big screen."
2,Ho Hum,I agree with the first reviewer the scene with the fiddler in the swamp was probably the best scene in it. Oh and also every scene with Katie Holmes meow!
4,You've Never Seen Keanu Like This!,"""The Gift"" is a quiet movie with strong performances, especially from my favorite person in the universe, Keanu Reeves. Here he plays a wife-beating redneck who can be polite and charming one minute, and terribly violent the next. He does a startling turn in this one, as do many others, including Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes, and Giovanni Ribisi. Cate Blanchett is fine as a psychic in a small town, using her gift to help support her and her children since the death of her husband. Facing harrassment from Reeves' Donnie Barksdale, as well as being ridiculed in open court, Blanchett's Annie is quietly strong, yet somewhat fragile when it comes to her startlingly horrific visions. The setting is perfectly creepy (it was filmed in Savannah, GA,) and the film has a nice surprise ending, somewhat akin to ""The Sixth Sense."" I highly reccomend ""The Gift."""
3,"Blanchett is great, Ribisi is awesome and Reeves is evil","this one is about Blanchett and shes the towns local psychic with her tera cards and stuff. Hilary Swank visits her about her abusive husband played with pure evilness by Keanu Reeves who looks like he didnt shower for awhile, Reeves starts to terroize Blanchett and all the while Katie Holmes ends up missing and dead. Blanchett suspects Reeves and Reeves goes to jail but she soon finds out the truth, it was Greg Kinnear who did it. Giovanni Ribisi is snapping in his role and he shows it. the highlight is when Reeves tries to mess with Blanchett's kid and Ribisi takes out a crowbar and bashes up Reeves' truck, awesome and this is directed by Sam Raimi people, the person who brought you A Simple Plan, Spider-man, Evil Dead I and II and Army Of Darkness. Katie Holmes has some good tatas, heh heh"
4,Good! worth watching!,"This movie has a good story line and well directed.Acting is good, especially, Keanu Reeves acts well and makes this movie good.This is not a masterpiece but you can enjoy much.I would like to recommend this to you.Thank you."
5,Enjoyable & Unique,"This movie is one of Giovanni Ribisi's best performances ever. His talent really shows in this role. Not to mention Hilary Swank, who is excellent in just about everything. A great thriller and an excellent cast of characters that keeps you watching until the end!"
2,Predictable,"""The Gift"" is so predictable you'll think you've seen it before. If you can't figure out what's going to happen within the first 30 minutes I sort of envy your ability to enjoy this level of plotting. On the other hand I assume you've lost a lot of money to Nigerian scammers.The acting is quite good, though the plethora of big stars is distracting."
5,A scary movie with a lot of suspense,"Tons of scary movie dont really have mystery or suspense and this movie did, so I was really pleased with that. I say this is a must see movie."
3,Predictable but Very Viewable,Have watched this movie twice since purchasing it and am very proud of our Cate Blanchett. What an established actress she has become. If u cannot guess who the villian is in this movie before half time I will be very surprised.
2,"Good Premise, but......","Well, worth seeing, about a psychic in the south (Cate Blanchett) enlisted to help find a missing girl (Katie Holmes. One star for a semi-original idea, another for Katie Holmes's (...). Yeah, it was OK. It's not like I want 2 hours of my life back, but I won't be investing another 2 hours anytime soon."
4,More of a review on Keanu Reeves's part,"The plot of this movie could've been a bit better (it was rather predictable and, to me, slow at points) but I found the cast very good. I found all the characters believable. I was especially impressed by Keanu Reeves's character (who was really the reason i rented this--I'm a huge fan) who I didn't expect to be very good. I didn't think he could pull off a villian role (even in ""The Watcher"" he never eally showed much of an evil side) but the first little...outburst effectively freaked me out. I just can't stand him with a Southern accent...So, I really recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a mystery movie. Not that there's much mystery to it really."
4,THE ALMOST PERFECT GIFT,"A fortune-teller uses her psychic powers to help the police catch the killer responsible for a gruesome small town murder.For all its clever twists and turns, this gripping suspense thriller is spoiled by a weak, unsatisfying ending. Nevertheless, polished performances from a top-notch cast - including the brilliant Cate Blanchett - makes this a movie well worth adding to your collection.Special mention for Katie Holmes in another small, supporting role who again shows the darker side to her sweet Joey Potter persona in Dawson's Creek (check her out in the brilliant Wonder Boys as well). The cutesy girl-next-door has finally come of age, growing with maturity as an actress into a leading lady to watch our for in the future!"
3,"Loves parts, had me yelling at the TV on others...","This movie had an overall good story. Cate Blanchet and Giovanni Ribisi were my fave throught the movie, providing great performances. The rest of the cast was, well, average.The thing that had me the most annoyed was that Cate Blanchet's character, although having the ""gift"" to see things, would let a wife-beater into her house at night with her children around while he threatens here, follow a man to a swampy river (AT NIGHT!) by herself (which was practically her death)... I kept screaming at the tv ""No! You know better than that!"".Loved the trippy ending, which sorta reminded me of the Sixth Sense."
5,Honest Film About A Southern Taboo,"This movie was made in Savannah, Ga. If you saw Midnight In The Garden, you are already aware of the 'other' presence there of magic, obeah and other supernatural events. Ribisi is just incredible in this film. I really like this guy enormously. He gives 1000 percent in every performance. Ms. Blanchett shines as the gal with the gift. While the story is very over the top, all of the people depicted are right on. I did get a few phone calls from back home (Savannah) asking me if I had anything to do with this film inasmuch as I am known for having the gift, myself. Nope. Not a thing. But I did very much enjoy watching the film and understanding how difficult it is to be special in a small city. Seeing Katie Holmes topless was rather a shock, but this was before Tom came on the scene. Greg Kinnear gives a low-key, endearing but really honest performance. I won't give the ending away but you will be surprised. Enjoyable movie to watch on a rainy weekend night."
4,A 4 star movie with all stars,The star cast of this movie is just too much. Its fun to watch all of them together in one movie and they definately keep the show running without any dull moment. Giovanni Ribisi as Buddy Cole steals every scene in which he appears. Its a good movie to rent or buy with the on going USED price.
2,OK - but not great!!,"Reading the other reviews on this page made me wonder if I had seen the same movie as them! Yes, The Gift was creepy, but it started slowly and took a hell of a time to get going. Maybe this was to build up the suspense, but it just made the movie drag and go on forever!In spite of this, all performances were good. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress, as is Katie Holmes who is finally breaking away from her Dawson's creek image. The real star of this movie though had to be Keanu Reeves. Granted he didn't have much screen time, but the time he did have he made good use of, giving one of his best and most realistic performances to date.However, even the performances by all the actors in this movie could not save it! Aside from a few creepy (not scary!) moments, it dragged and to be perfectly honest I was glad to get out of the cinema!!"
5,Best Movie I saw in 2001,"I happened to come upon this movie one night in the video store. I was gleefully surprised by the suspenseful plot and the genuinely good acting. The actors in it are less well known overall, but it was the best movie I saw in 2001. I recommend you pick it up at the video store too."
1,A country with a lack of irony,"Obviously the author of the following quote is a .........?""demonstrates that you don't have to be a white Christian to be a dangerous racist spreading lies and promoting genocide---he's actually the only non-white non-Christian that I know of who is doing so in this country"""
1,Don't waste your money...,"Bought this product to clean ""black streaks"" from a cargo trailer. Product does not instantly, nor with scrubbing, remove the black streaks as it claims. False advertisement. May be good for cleaning floors as the other reviewer stated, but I bought it to clean ""black streaks"" as advertised and it does no such thing?"
5,excellent product and service,"Most satisfied with the CD player very good sound and pitch control and easy to use,and the service was prompt and good."
4,boring?,"I can understand how people can say that this CD is boring. I just don't agree with them. It depends upon what kind of mood you are in. If you are in a danceandrockandroll kind of mood, this ain't gonna cut it. If, on the other hand you are looking for music to listen to while having a quiet romantic at-home dinner (i.e. wine, roses, chocolate mousse and coffee after dinner) this is perfect. It's a great prelude for...a long evening with your significant other. It's the kind of music that is the perfect soundtrack to watching the snowflakes fall (preferably while snuggled in the arms of the above person) or soaking in a hot tub. I listen to it while doing design work as well as it seems to allow the creative juices to flow without distracting me from the work at hand."
3,"Pleasant, but low energy","There is no question that Metheny and Haden make beautiful music together; but except for a few cuts (especially the last one, ""Spiritual"") I find the beauty skin deep, lacking passion. The music for the most part is forgettable."
4,sublime bass and guitar tones,.....on first hearing this CD I wasn't sure what exactly Metheny and Haden where trying to achieve. After several listenings I have to say that this is one of my favorite CD's. The musical and emotional synergy between these two friends comes across in their playing. Just a brilliant piece of music to be enjoyed by everyone!
4,Storytelling,"Bassist Charlie Haden and guitarist Pat Metheny have played on many recordings that have found a home in my collection over the years, sometimes as leaders, sometimes as sidemen, sometimes together, sometimes separately, but this is the first CD to feature just the two of them in a duet setting. Both these musicians are from Missouri, and both love to tell stories through their music--thus the title of this CD. This is largely an acoustic album, just the two of them picking in the studio, with just a light touch of electronic shading from time to time overdubbed by Metheny. Musically, this is a CD that is soft and tender; sonically, it is clean and powerful, and it is going to give some systems fits. Special notice should be given to the packaging of this CD, which is both functional and beautiful."
3,Disappointing sound production,"Unless i have a bad cd, this album does not do justice to the actual live production. The sound is not crisp, and coming from Magnepans that is highly unusual...and in contrast, i absolutely love New Chattaqua and the Mays-Hall album. I think they are very superior to this production, at least in the recording techniques."
5,I fu like this...,"I am always looking for similar soundind CD's ,..try Jason Miles(with Bill Frissell),..very cool,..never seen it mentioned here"
2,ZZZZzzzz... Wake me up when it's time to change the CD,"I absolutely love the Pat Metheny Group. Seen them live five times. Own four of their CDs and a DVD. I even like some of Pat's more mellow stuff. But man, this duet puts me right to sleep. It's not bad music, it's just lacking anything resembling spark."
1,A Good Album To Play While Reading a Book,"First off, I have to say as much as I appreciate Pat Metheny's skill and talent, I never found him to be a very interesting player . This album just confirms that assessment -- a crashing bore from note one. It's dull, pedantic, and extremely repetitive. A mismosh of wandering noodling that some may find sublime but I find aimless, trite and tedious. As for Charlie Haden -- maybe it's me, but I just don't see what's so great about this guy. He strikes me as a very average player. This isn't BAD music, it's just weak. Two over-rated musicians sleepwalking through uninspired compositions."
2,A low point,"Make no mistake - this is a dull album - both in terms of compositions and sound quality. I suppose all artists / musicians are prone to periods of creative inertia - and for Pat Metheny this is it. For Haden perhaps he has nothing to be excited about. Whatever the reasons, here we have 2 potentially good musician playing at being boring old men. Even live they failed to inspire. Sorry to all you rock solid fans. Personally, I have chosen to just by-pass this embarassment and get onto the next good album, which Matheny has delivered, thankfully - as the trio album. Now that IS a good album."
5,His most introspective album!,"Pat Metheny could have made the best smooth guitar album in the year. In this time we find to Pat under the midnight spell with an impressive selection of slender melodies and the remarkable supporting of Charlie Haden in the bass.From the first track to the last one you will amaze and engage immediately. Metheny decide to pay his personal tribute to the lyric guitar under the candlelight.Thanks to a very missed girl who gave me her last present, I found myself extremely and powerful amazed from the first time I listened it. And since that moment I became a profound fan of this album, enjoying with avidity and immense pleasure.Do not doubt for a moment. This album is great and I recommend you without reserves."
4,Good budget collection.,"Normaly I am against the endless stream of Clannad reissues that BMG on both sides of the Atlantic churn out (seems they do that to all their artists). But this one is a great collection for the casual fan. Since they maintained the same record company in Europe, unlike here when they switched to Atlantic, this cd is able to cover a good sample of the 80's and even more new age 90's. The amount of songs, the mix from a good chunk of the history (leaving out the folkier days) and the good price make this a good compilation to get. Not really the essential Clannad, but a good place to start."
3,I still done know Judge Thomas,"I was left wanting more. I felt the book was written to achieve a certain number of pages instead of providing me information about Judge Thomas. The book often provides far to much information about the people passing through his life. I was not interested in reading so much informatin about the people who employ him or the people he met on his life journey.The book did address some of Judge Thomas early social ideas, but the book seem to be written without much input from Judge Thomas. I did not get the sense that I knew Judge Thomas after I completed the book."
3,For a different view than the first four I see here,"Under the link above ""product details"" to ""see all editorial reviews,"" see the review by Randall Kennedy for the Washington Post"
1,Why do Tenorio and Ultima seem the same?,"If you have read this book, which is a very sorry one indeed, I would like to pose this question... Why do Tenorio and Ultima seem the same? Think about the similarities of the two and you'll see what I mean. If Antonio is trying so hard to distinguish between good and evil, why does the woman he idolizes so much, seem so evil? Antonio wants good, not evil! This book makes no sense whatsoever!!!!"
1,A horribly bad novel,"One of the worst books ever written. I struggled to interest myself in the storyline, which would have been a lot easier if there was a decent one present. There should have been a lot more stucture to support Anaya's unrealistic ideas present throughout the book. It was simply all around bad. I would never wish the boredom this book causes on anyone..."
1,"Dated, Awkward, Self-Hating Language","If you think it's okay to use white to symbolize all that's good in the world and black to symbolize all that's evil, this book is for you and those white sheets you love so much. I just read Chapter 10 that has no less than sixteen examples of imagery intimating that black is evil - and oh, by the way, the one time white is used, it conveys a divine presence. One of the lines actually reads, ""You are as ugly as your dark soul."" I guess that's why the film, Dress Code, satirically quipped, ""What's wrong with a black soul?"" I combed and combed to find any hint of satire or veiled social commentary, but there was none. Given comments by Fox (both the network and the former Mexican Prez), it's amazing at what can be internalized without realizing the damage that can be done to society."
3,"Bless Me, Ultima","Bless Me, Ultima is an interesting story of a boy, named Antonio, who grows up during World War II. He has to overcome many obstacles, and has the help of Ultima, a good witch, to guide him to the correct path.I don't like this book, because it is boring, and does not catch my attention. If it were more suspenseful, it might be a better book.I reccommend this book to anybody that likes slow books, and can keep focused on the story."
2,Bless Me Ultima,"I purchased this book because it was my book club selection. If I had known that a good share of the book required a knowledge of Spanish, I would have bowed out.However,the foreword built the book up so much that I looked forward to reading it.Result:I was disappointed in the book (as far as I got...probably 40 pages). I went to my book club meeting anyway in hopes I would discover what I missed but still didn't find the book something I would not to others.. The book was sold ""as is"" I guess because there were many underlines(which I focused on in order to ""borrow"" from another reader but that person apparently had many problems, too.)"
4,Great story!,"I suppose what made the book so interesting is that I live in an area where many of these practices are still carried on today and not far from the fictional setting of the story. The whole story leads one to believe that it centers on the life of one, young Hispanic boy named Antonio. It isn't until the very end that we learn that Ultima is the principal character. She dies and so ends the story. After following little Antonio through a couple years of his life we are left hanging at the end. There are too many loose ends that need to be followed up on in a subsequent book which, as far as I know, does not exist."
4,Awesome,This coming of age story was inspirational. While reading it brought memories of my youth. The author's interpretation of growing up in a Latin culture is amazing. It could almost be my own story.
1,Mexican History,"I know a lot of people with Mexican history and I am pretty sure I don't know a single person that has lived this life. I did admire Ultima. I didn't care about the ""coming of age"" story of the young boy."
5,Great book,Very good made me remember the stories I was told when I was growing up in a small-town stories that I pass on to my kid's and hopefully they'll tell their own kid's
5,Spellbinding....magic!,"I had to read this book for my eighth grade English class years ago. It had such meaning because my family is from Eastern New Mexico. Puerto de Luna, or PDL as we call it, is along the Pecos River not in Northern New Mexico as some might think. Rudolfo Anaya is from Eastern New Mexico as well. Look at a map! Just sitting on a mesa on our ranch is enough for anyone to believe that God is alive and well and watching us at all times. Tony has that magic thought pattern that helps us all to look beyond the obvious and concentrate on the mystic. This book brings New Mexico alive."
4,A Hispanic boy¿s coming-of-age story,"Set in NM on the border between a small village and the huge llano (plains), Bless Me, Ultima is Rudolfo Anaya's much acclaimed and award-winning coming-of-age novel from the Hispanic perspective. Antonio is torn betw his father's cowboy side of the family who ride on the llano and his mother's village and farming relations. Many conflicts are presented here: Hispanic vs American culture, Catholicism vs paganism, parents' expectations vs the child's desires, Spanish blood vs native blood.Antonio's life is forever altered when his aunt Ultima, a curandera (healer) comes to live with the family; she teaches Antonio many things, most importantly how to gather the self-knowledge that will help carry him into adulthood."
5,A pivotal text,"Rather than recap the book's plot, as so many others have done, I will simply state that this book deserves a five-star rating for two reasons:1. It broke the door wide open for hundreds of Hispanic-American writers. It is to Chicano literature what Native Son and Invisible man are to African-American literature.2. It is a completely commonplace narrative technique, the bildungsroman (or coming-of-age story) set in an entirely new place (for its time), with an entirely new set of actors, situations, cultural beliefs, and literary traditions.There are countless minor reasons I could use to justify my position, but the bottom line is that it is an important literary work that will have a long life for both of the reasons I've stated above.Plus, it's a damn good book."
4,"God bless, Ultima",The turmoil of growing up within mixed believes and a natural instinct for mother Nature. A growing up oveshadowed by Christianity with many soul searching experiences. Thank God for Ultima!
4,"This book was decent, I would probably recommend it.","This novel by Rudolfo Anaya certainly lived up to the ""blessing"" part of the title. From the begining of the novel when Ultima came to live with the Marez family to after she died, the supernatural forces were constantly at work. From witches to golden fish to owls that carry souls, the constant reference to the spiritual world sets this novel apart from any other. Don't get me wrong, the novel is excellent, however some of the action which takes place remains beyond believability. Granted the novel is fiction, yet based on that it is representing the life of the Indian culture I found it far fetched. Overall I give it a seven as entertaining and interesting."
5,most amazing book,"This is my all-time favorite book. I re-read it every year and I feel the same strong emotions each time. It has something for everyone: crazy antics of 7 year old boys, in-depth discussion of religion, a touching relationship between a young boy and his grandmotherly mentor, supernatural events. I could go on but you just have to pick it up and read it for yourself. By the way, I teach Spanish and my students read it each semester, and 95% of them love it (I think the other 5% never actually read it.)"
3,"Good, but boring at some points","In the beginning, I didn't find 'Bless Me, Ultima' interesting at all. But as the story went on, the characters developed, and I started to understand what was really going on. From mid-way until the end, the book was very good, and I liked the way symbolism showed the way in the story."
5,Ultima is a true look at New Mexico,"I was born and raised in Northern New Mexico. Whenever new friends ask me what it was like to live here, I tell them to read Bless Me Ultima. Anaya's book is filled with the spiritalism and humor that make life in Northern NM special. His character of Ultima is as real as I have ever read. Perhaps others will read the book and take it as a piece of far-out fiction. However, from reading this book, I know that Rudolfo has experienced the mystery of this sacred area. This book stands head and shoulders above anything else Anaya has done. It is already a classic for Chicano readers and is practically a Bible for those of us who are from the area."
3,I considered this an odd novel.,"Recently I was required to pick 2 novels off the college bound list to read for the summer. I picked Bless Me,Ultima for one. I was upset with the constant skipping around. I didn't care for the vomiting of the green bile. I also didn't take to kindly to the voodo dolls. kinda odd! Otherwise, I was decently entertained with the skippy story line. Many people have different views though and my review is my review so read it yourself and find out is the best way to tell! thanks so much for reading this. nicole honors 11 student"
2,This is a classic? Literature's going down the drain if so..,"I had to read this book for 8th grade English.I hated it.Everybody in my class and the other classes who read it hated it.I think that every book you're required to read, you have a sort of prejudice against. But, I'm reading Ordinary People now for 9th grade English and I can tell I'm going to love it. I think that since I live in New Mexico, and Rudolfo Anaya is a really acclaimed author of the state, we should ""appreciate"" this book.I'm sorry. I just can't do it. I can't see why this is a classic. I guess it was an okay book, but even so, I hated it. Not because it was necessarily bad. Actually, I'm not sure why.Anyway, I have some opinions worth disagreeing with myself. I loved (LOVED) The Catcher in the Rye; others hated it. See for yourself."
1,1 Star is far too generous,"My daughter has been reading this book for Honors English, and it has been sheer torture. She has found the book to be boring, and difficult to understand due to the extensive use of Spanish text. In addition, there is a lot of profanity used, including the ""f"" word, and ""bulls**t"" and others. We find this offensive. With so much wonderful literature available for use in the classroom, we are saddened that this is the best they could do.I would not recommend this book to anyone. I started reading it, too, but found it to be a big pain."
3,Review,"Bless me, Ulyima was like book like I have never read, it started off slow and gradually got more exciting. I had two opinions toward the book, one is positive and one is negitive. I liked this book because Antonio was like myself as a child. He is a small kid who is trying to find the truth of his faith. This cahracter was not perfect like most characters, but he portrayed as an innocent little boy. He was a sneaky little child who followed his father everywhere and got into fights at school. THe side of the book I disliked was the way he potrayed the Catholic Church. It seemed like there were cuss words than any other book I have ever read. I thingk he showed many bad sides of the Catholic Church including the way we pray. I don't think I would read another book by Rudolfo Anaya because it was very confusing getting into the novel. I also would read his work because of the cuss words. I would rate this book as a 3 star because of my conflicting opinions on the book."
3,"Bless Me, Ultima","When I first started to read Bless Me, Ultima, I didn't really know what to think about it. It was strange, interesting, but at the same time boring. When Antonio is six, a curandera, or Ultima comes to live with his family. Ultima could heal through herbs and magic. I didn't really understand the book from that point. I wanted the story to be more realistic for me, and I wanted to relate with some of the characters. To me, the whole healing with magic didn't work. Probably because I am not of the hispanic culture that I didn't understand or believe what was going on. One thing I did understand and relate to is that Antonio was pressured to become something when he wasn't ready to. His mother was pushing him to become a religious leader. On a scale of one to five stars, I would have to rate this book a 2.5 or 3. It told a great story of a boy growing up with many adversities and how he overcomes them. But at the same time, we need to be awake to read it."
5,A thought-provoker,What a beautiful book! Anyone who has ever experienced doubts about his/her religion (no matter what it may be) will recognize elements of Antonio Marez's dilemma.
5,Bless Me Ultima,"I bought this book because the school board banned it from the tenth grade reading list in this small valley town. The teachers protested to no avail. It was banned because a parent did not like the tiny amount of profanity in the book.This is an excellent book which has great moral value, exhibits some aspects of hispanic culture and would make for excellent classroom discussion. The ""smattering"" of profanity in English and Spanish was nearly non existent within the scope of what the author was attempting to portray. Good book for any one age 12 to 100."
3,Just didn't get it,"Although the characters, the general story line, and the writer's style kept me engaged, I guess I just didn't ""get"" this book. I just never figured out what Anaya was trying to tell me. It seems clear that all the characters and events are allegorical in some way, but I simply couldn't make the connections. I found the juxtaposition of catholocism and mysticism interesting, but the young narrator's wisdom and enlightenment was simply off-putting. I mean, come on, the kid is supposed to be 5 years old when the story starts, and what--6 or 7 at the end? His level of self awareness and reflection rivals that of a philosophy grad student. If the main character had at least been adolescent, I MAY have believed he existed. . ."
1,Do not buy from this seller,"I would never purchase from this seller. The book arrived extremely late and even though they would say it was within 14 days , I have never ever made a purchase that has actually before that has taken this long. The book is difficlut to read . It has large red pen writing on every single page - no word of exaggeration . Not my idea of a book to be called in ""good"" condition.Will never trust this seller again.They could never provide me with a tracking number in 14 days!"
2,"Joni, Andrew, Walt. Donavon","This was a pretty good book that involves a young boy who has been torn between his mother and his father. Taking him on a mystical journey through manhood. With influence from Ultima, who from the first time that they met, made a huge impact on Tony. Ultima seems to have the power to make people see things for what they are and the reasons behind why people act the way that they do. With heart thumping violence a tear jerking psychological battle between right and wrong, Tony becomes a MAN."
2,A review on Bless Me Ultima,"We just finished reading Bless Me Ultima in our English II class, and I can honestly say that glad. Rudolfo Anaya's portrayal of a young boy trying to choose the right path in life is quite amusing. I can honestly say that there are not many seven year old boys who are seriously thinking about choosing to be what their mother wants them to be, or choosing to be what their father wants them to be. Children think about playing in trees or in the dirt; not becoming a priest or a vaquero.The dreams that young Antonio experiences are closer to visions of the future, than real dreams. He sees himself and his brothers near the river. He also sees himself going with his brothers to a whore house. The boring and meaningless dreams get longer and longer as the book progresses.The action actually picks up in the book about fifteen pages from the end. This pointless book carries on for chapters at a time and I do not suggest reading it."
3,"Bless Me, Ultima","This is the coming of age story of Antonio, a young boy lost in his search for religion and torn between his parents' expectations of him. I was required to read this book for school and did not enjoy it as much as some of the other books that I have read. The plot is somewhat dry and not very exciting. What was interesting was the character development throughout the book and what each character represented in Antonio's life. I'm not sure I would recommend this book to others but you may want to read it if you are interested in culture and religion."
4,A high school must read,"Well I had to read this in high school because the teacher made us, but anyway I had to read this book again because of the comprative religion class that I was taken. It wasn't that good when I first read it, however, as I was reading it this time it seemed a lot better because I could understand most of it.The story is about thecoming of age of a little boy, written as a reflection back to his childhood, and how he ultimately learns responability and decisions based on the things one person does through Ultima.It's a pretty easy read, and the story does not have a climax to it, but it's a decent book."
4,"Great Movie, was a little sad at the end, but shows how much an Elderly person contributes in a good way to children.","Really was a very good story, I liked it a lot because it shows how much an older person is appreciated by a very young child who was influenced by her culture and beliefs. He never forgets all she taught him by example and he grows up to be a very caring person."
4,Fantastic Chicano bildungsroman with conflict as its motif.,"Bless me, is a story about the coming of age of a young mexican-american kid who is internally torn by the choices that he has to make throughout his life. Anaya portrays the conflict in a very vivid way that makes the reader more aware of the chicano society in 1940's New Mexico. This is an excellent book for those people that have ever quetion their own religion and destiny."
1,Did you know this is DAG's father that wrote this.,Most may not know this but Dr Grier is DAG (David Alan Grier) the actor and commedian's father. Just a tidbit of useless info.
1,Like Smoke from a Factory,"Truly amazing. Finally a book that captures the essence of disgusting. Words cannot describe the dullness that drifts from the pages of Black Rage, like the smoke from a factory. A thought that could have been condensed into a sentence or two the authors have managed to expand into 200 pages of nothingness. Though it may have started off as a cute idea, it quickly turned into a nauseating yet boring book. If you enjoyed Black Rage you may also enjoy the encyclopedia, thesaurus, or just sitting in a room for hours doing nothing."
2,Poor sound quality,"The music, while stellar, suffers from very poor production quality. As opposed to the soundtrack which has very good sound, the musicians here seem inexplicably distant (given that the tunes were all taken from the same set of session material). Perhaps I just got a bad disc, but I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this CD where they couldn't return it no questions asked."
4,"Lodge 10 1/4"" cast iron frying pan cover",This cover fits the classic Lodge frying pan so well that you can vent out of one if the pan's pouring spouts if you want to. I would have liked thicker material but it's OK and looks good. Made in Minnesota USA!
3,Not true to size!,"This cover is 10.5 inches in diameter, much bigger than my other 10 inch calphalon cover and fits only one of my many 10 inch pans.I guess I should have bought their 9 inch cover to fit my 10 inch pans.Also the steel is kind of thin."
2,very thin and aluminum rivet,"The lid works well as a substitute for a glass lid and fits perfectly for lodge 10.25"" skillet. However, the material is super thin and light-weighted. The lid feels cheap which probably justifies the lower price comparing to other brands. It's definitely not ""heavy"" or ""durable"" or ""professional-grade"" as advertised. The rolled-over edge makes it hard to clean. But my major concern is that there are no stainless steel caps on top of the aluminum rivets, which defeats the purpose of having a stainless steel lid as opposed to an aluminum one that costs less. Aluminum easily reacts to whatever it comes in contact with. In short, if you just want an additional lid without spending much, it's a good price. But I will not buy it again because of my concern about aluminum."
3,"Relaxing, Enjoyable but...","Relaxing, enjoyable to see but I felt as though it was heavily focused on Maine, NH and Vermont and little time was spent on Connecticut and the Islands. Could have been more time spent on showing the Mt.Washington Hotel as well. Otherwise nice, takes you to New England and gives you a feeling of relaxation. Worth the purchase all in all."
5,Great for Film students!!,"This camcorder is a must for film students. I'm a student at USC, and this camcorder really made my short films look great!!! We don't get to use the schools' really awesome gear until our Junior or Senior year. If you have the money, its an amazing buy!"
5,An oldie but a goodie,"In the movie, Showtime, the fearless reality TV cameraman (the same actor plays a scruffy writer on 30 Rock) carries a Canon XL2. That should tell you how old the design is. In the finale, the XL2's little brother, the Canon GL2, also plays a key part in the story. Canon did a wiz-bang job of product placement. A decade later, the SD-format XL2 is still a well-designed, and now quite affordable, workhorse. Though HD-obsessed film-makers are moving to RED or DSLR cameras, SD is still a useful format for low-def jobs such as low-budget industrial videos and most YouTube stuff."
2,Several Shades of Jade/ Breeze From the East,"The First album Several Shades of Jade, did not play. I suspect It was damaged however the album Breeze from the East did. I was happy enough with that, as it was what I was looking for."
1,Child's play,I think that it can only be enjoyed by 2-5 year olds that are interested in bugs and insects as shown
4,It's OK,My 3 year old thought this was OK. Hasn't asked to watch again in two weeks. The god references were a little unexpected.
1,totally junk,"I watched 3 minutes of it & threw it in a dumpster, the sync was even bad, it was out if sync, DON'T WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS DVD"
3,I EXPECTED MORE FROM A COLUMBIA-ASIAN COLLABORATION,"The production quality was very good, acting fine but still rather melodramatic; the writing lacked coherence and polish; so-much so after awhile one wonders what's happening and who's doing whatto who and why. Most Asian motion pictures are now pretty slick; this, production values aside,could have been from the 80's, maybe 90's.And of course, the premise is never really resolved in spite of mandatory blood baths. Sort of action looking for a reason."
2,good thing I had no expectations going in....,"So I bought this film soley on the fact that David Morse was involved. And though my love for David is great it was not enough to overcome the fact that this film is horrible. I found it slow and for a horror, I must have blinked when the scares were taking place for there were no chills to be had. The best scare was the worst moment in the film but I don't want to give anything away to those who might want to give it a try. If you don't mind wasting $4 on a movie give it a go."
3,Strangely Uninvolving,"I found this album to be intriguing but uninvolving. As a fan of Mr. Hancock's work, the interplay with Mr. Shorter was certainly worth investigating. But none of the numbers managed to truly connect with me like many of his earlier ones had."
2,Waste of money,"I bought these because I was suckered by the ""manly"" marketing. These are no better in quality than a $1 pair of pastel shower gloves. Sure, being a guy, I prefer having black gloves, but these are fraying after a couple months and were WAY overpriced.Save your money and buy something cheaper."
1,Far too small,Most men will not find that these gloves fit them; they are simply too small for a man; better for a small woman or a girl or boy.
2,interesting,"to be honest, i have only heard of one band on this cd. and that is Yellowcard. i love yellowcard, and ""For pete's sake"" is a good song. so check it out."
3,MC CHRIS!!!,"MC CHRIS! It's short but sweet. ""White Kids Love Hip Hop"" and ""Geek"" pretty much make this album a must have for the fan."
4,"Oh, Canada","Brava, Makeda on your wonderfully-written first novel! The level of honesty in this book is eye-opening and refreshing to say the least. The use of patois throughout is courageous and it is this choice, more than any other, that lends a certain authenticity to the work that ultimately makes it a success. In one stroke, Ms. Silvera has brought several groups who are so often overlooked to the fore: Jamaicans in Canada, gay men in Jamaica, lesbian women. So many people go to ""foreign"" (countries) to obtain a better way of life, and this book beautifully shows the way that families are often bisected by the very binationalism that ensures their survival."
5,Awesome movie,"Cant wait to see the next one. This is great. The booth brothers do great work. I love everything they do.Awesome, awesome, awesome"
1,Photo used without permission,"I recently watched a documentary ""Children Of The Grave"" and noticed one of my photographs was used without my permission.The caption on the photo was "" Digital Still From Night Vision Cam Black Mass Sighting, Zombie Road "" The photo was black and white. I have the original color photo and still have the camera card with the original photo on it.Two people asked me to sign a waiver so they could use any of my photo's they needed and I stated I wouldn't sign the waiver they presented to me. I said I would let my photo's be used as long as proper credit was given, it wasn't,instead they used my photo and made it sound like they took the photo when they were filming the documentary. I have emails to these two people stating that. I did belong to their paranormal group and when I refused to sign the waiver they dropped me from the group and banned me from the web site. Then they took my photo and used it without permission!!!"
3,Children of the Grave,"I'd heard about this video from my sisters, couldn't wait to see it. Very interesting, though a little disappointing. Some of the footage was just too unclear to really see what they were seeing, and telling you what you were seeing before you saw it was a little too suggestive for me, it made me feel as if they were telling you what you were supposed to see as opposed to what you were actually seeing."
5,"Sad, Historical, Fascinating","I love history.I love ghost stories...especially the ""true"" ones.I love documentaries.Well worth the watch, super interesting, and a little depressing. Lots of history you don't hear, lots a facts that get swept under the carpet...like so many of these kids. Kinda of a spooky history lesson, shocking tale, and docudrama all wrapped into one package.Troy Taylor's books are also great reads with lots of historical background."
3,War pilot having a mystic experience,"In this book Exupéry appears as a mystic. The state is spurred because he find himself in severe danger during the battle of France in 1940. Somehow he comes into a state because of the extreme pressure he is under. He expresses aristocratic views upon humanity, where he proclaims that he wants to live and die for ""The Human"" instead of a ""mass of humans"". Proberly he would have been sad to see how the world developed after him, where, in the name of democracy, the world was to be controlled by mass culture, continualy debasing itself. In this writing one wonders if Exupéry is actually out of his wits."
5,Absolutely love this thing.,"I have two of these.First one I purchased 10+ years ago and it's still in great shape. But after all that time and not taking very good care of it, I decided to treat myself to a new one.As long as you keep it somewhat moist and packaged it will last 10+ years no problem.I use it when I travel and when I swim. If you have to pack a towel when you travel (not staying at a hotel) then this can easily take the place of the towel to dry yourself off after a shower. I would even argue that it might be faster.I usually clean it with a tiny bit of detergent and soak it in in water for a little while.I can't say enough about this towel. Just love it."
2,Workout Sweat Towel,"NOTE: I returned this after 3-4 weeks. I followed the instructions, but the towel had white spots on it. I believe it was mold!!! Also it smelled like my sweat, even after washing it. BEWARE!!!!!"
3,"Good, but tiny.","I was surprised to learn that this product is about the size of a dish towel. It is very absorbent though. The texture is a little unpleasant, but you get used to it."
4,Great product,"It is exactly as advertised,it does the trick,it really does work.the only con would be is that the direction say to always keep it wet and to keep it in it's container but then it started to have this funky smell because of the water."
1,It isnt't worth even 5 bucks.,I go swim 3-5 days a week and I would say that this towel absolutely useless for everyday use as towel for swimmer.It is extremely small and doesn't wipe off your body like any other synthetic towel. Your body still wet after using this towel.
3,Works well.,The only concern I have is that the chamois has to be kept moist. Wouldn't that cause bacteria build up or mold?
3,Wrinkles,"The material is designed for quick drying, but it wrinkles a lot without water. I don't like the feeling when it shrinks."
3,ok,"I bought them for my husband, he uses them when he is doing his exercises. He told me he like them."
2,eehhh??,absorbed well but lost color in one use at a community swimming pool. i used this for springboard diving so i might just tie die the washed out colorless shammy and reuse it
4,No size info !!!,"How does one know the size of this towel ???No mention of the dimensions !!! Help, please."
4,Don't Forget Your Towel!,"The Speedo Sports towel is an artifical chamois designed to wick water and sweat away from your body while remaining a compact item that can fit in your swim bag or gym tote.I use mine to wash off after working out; gyms these days have no showers (what's with that?!) but my office lav has a sink, so I wash off after working out before I hit my desk. I use this towel to dry off.It fits into a plastic sleeve and it's supposed to stay moist, otherwise, like any chamois, it gets hard and has to be rehydrated. I assume, since it stays moist, it has an anti-fungal and antibacterial component in the fiber, which is cotton-based.As has been said here, it can get a funky smell but it can be washed in the washing machine, which you'd want to do anyway, or swished out with soap in the sink. It also can get a funny color on the crease (mine is blue and a rusty spot showed up.)The dimensions: 40cm x 30cm or 15 3/4"" by 12""."
5,"keeps me dry, not heavy in backpack","I commute on my bike and swim in the morning. A normal towel ends up taking up too much space and adds too much weight. This little guy solves both problems. It does a good job of drying me off. I don't miss the ""snuggle"" factor of a normal towel as much as I expected."
5,My 4-year-old loves it,"My son loves this video and a DVD we have from the same series. The DVD will only play two 15 minutes episodes (there are 6 oon each DVD) before returning to the menu, there is no ""play all"" feature, but my son dearly loves the show and watches closely to spot the clues first. There are bonus challenges (additional items to look for) that will challenge slightly older children as well."
2,"looks good, doesn't function very well for animals","This thing looks like a great idea, but there are fundamental design flaws. My 7 year daughter waited for the full 10 weeks to receive her ""free"" tadpole ($6 shipping and handling), and, on day one, we found it had jumped out of the water, and ended up between the plastic layers and died. She was so bumbed. So, we then purchased a firebelly frog, which eats crickets. The crickets are now doing the same thing, jumping to the edges, and falling between plastic layers. We're going to replace this thing with a regular 10 gallon tank.I do admit, the frog looks darn cute in this habitat, but for practicality, it's just not going to work."
2,Polly went belly up,"My 6 year old twins have wanted this bug/frog habitat since the first day they saw it. We decided it would make a fun and eductional birthday gift and summer project. Having ordered ladybugs and ants by mail before, we decided to go to our ""local pet store"". The instructions make it sound as if any pet store would have a leopard frog tadpole and this is not the case. Finding one at an exotic pet store,we bought one and have enjoyed it for about 2 weeks. One night, ""Polly"" jumped out and got stuck between the habitat and the cover. The boys were crushed. In addition to our questioning how a full sized leopard frog would be content living in this habitat, the full extent of what we were getting into was a surprise as well. The frog feeding and life expectancy require more research than indicated. Our habitat also ""leaked"" if you got water between the insert and base."
1,Terrible experience,"We had problems with this habitat from the moment we started using it. It is flimsy, leaky, and it has a major design flaw--there is a gap between the plastic cover and the fake ""terrain"" the frog is supposed to crawl on. Initially this was just an inconvenience as the crickets we fed the frog fell in the gap. Then one morning my son was crushed to find his beloved frog, Hot Sauce, had fallen in the gap and was literally smashed flat. If you want to raise a frog, visit a pet or reptile store and buy an actual aquarium or terrarium--don't risk letting your kids make a grim discovery."
2,Electronics does not fit Shirley Horn,"A big production mistake. Ms.Horn with an electronic piano. Not even her sensitive singing has saved this CD from discomfort. Forget it. Like in baseball, why change the rules if the team has always been a winner? The great Shirley Horn is acoustics. And how great it is! Keep on browsing on Horn albums. Then listen to the samples and you'll know what I mean."
4,Good Beginner's Toy,"Quite nice - very effective and fun, but a bit on the small side. A really nice way to start out your toy collection.I would suggest having a special bag for it, as the finish promotes lint sticking. No noticeable smell, except when brand new, out of package, and is very easy to clean."
2,its ok.,The material is soft and smooth and it feels ok but a g-spot toy would be alot better... Maybe a tad too long.
4,Cowboy Fan Must Have,"Setting aside the seemingly endless drivel from Pete Gent this book is a must read. The entire book is comprised of Cowboys in their own words, almost makes you feel like you lived through it.It's a daunting task as it is a Tome, but if you simply skip Gent's endless complaints, you can cut 100 pages from the book."
3,Pretty good but--,"I thought the Landry era was covered very well. But once the author got to the post Landry era, he seemed to wing and rush through it with very few interviews of players from that era. So once he gets to the Jones/Johnson era the detail and players insights plummet and I was left feeling that the last 1/3 of the book was no where as interesting as the part before it. I think I would have been left with a higher impression of this book if the author had ended the book after his great coverage of the Landry era."
5,Simply Brilliant,If you're wondering which of the Original Series dvds to get first I'd advise you to get this one. Simply brilliant from beginning to end. The use of the pilot episode within the framework of the then current cast was excellently executed. A classic of the series.
4,"Neat episode, but it's only a sit-back","This show may have had the action all on the viewer, but really this was just boring. Sitting and watching it wasn't that good, but the plot had been written well. If you've watched ""The Cage"", you don't have to watch this one, but still it's okay because of the action on the viewer. It's also like seeing ""The Cage"" in the 23rd century, or it's like seeing ""The Cage"" with some added details. This may have been written not so good, but I still like it and I think you will, too."
1,A poor follow up to the Cage,"The idea of enveloping the first, unused Star Trek pilot ""The Cage"" with new footage (having the pilot act as a ""flashback"") was an interesting, but it did not work out well. The Cage was an excellent telefilm, needing no enveloping really, but the producers obviously felt otherwise. The enveloping story is full of plot holes and, quite plainly, not very good. Spock acts illogically and irrationally for a reason that just doesn't cut it (surely he could have found another way to help his Captain without mutiny). This is a bad episode. The episode it trys to present, ""The Cage"", is alot stronger when presented without the enveloping scenes."
3,Part 1-Great Part 2-Okay,"Started out great with the first 20 minutes being almost 5-star worthy. When ""The Cage"" scenes come in, it seems to go downhill. Part 2 Practically IS ""The Cage"", with a few interuptions. The end has an interesting twist that I won't mention. Pretty good and clever way to show ""The Cage"", but if you have ""The Cage"" video already, don't buy this."
5,great show,this was my fav show from first time it came out back in 60's n still is they have never tops this show in my opinion
5,Keeps you on edge,Heggan's action and suspense novels continue to impress me. I love that she keeps you guessing. The plots are not predictable and there's always a surprise to the end.
3,Great cover,Item was what I figured it would be Great!Item ship as was told it would and arrived on time.
4,5th Dimension Classics,"Great CD with every song you could want,except for one of my favorites... Never My Love.. originally recorded by The Association. The 5th Dimension put their signature sound on it and i've never heard it performed better! Other than this CD omitting this wonderful song, it's a definite keeper!"
4,"Not the same as original recording, except the CD cover","I purchased this CD to add to the missing 2nd CD from a previous CD set that is described as the masters recordings . The cover looks exactly like the original, however the one I purchased is not the masters reproduction, and therefore, doesn't include the same number of songs. A bit misleading as far as the CD cover is concerned."
5,"Lovely frame, easy to 'assemble'","This is a very simple, attractive frame for displaying documents. It's easy to use too--unlike many frames that require you to pry off metal tabs. I especially like that it has glass in front and in back of the document, creating the floating effect."
4,A Pure Demonic Blessing,"Sargeist and Horned Almighty are two black metal bands that are probably some of the blackest and most evil sounding ever. Craft (who is on the same record label: Moribund) are very very dark as well. Anyway, this split is a pure black metal attack. I gave it four stars only because it isn't the best thing I've heard, but it still is very cold, grim, and satanic."
3,Reston Lloyd Colander,"I got this in pink and loved it. But... it does chip and rust a little, and now doesn't look so great after just a few years. I'm now looking to replace it with something else. Although I'm all for whimsy in the kitchen, I think I'd prefer longevity."
2,For Star Trek Fans only,I was given this game by a friend who didnt like it..now Ive never watched star trek or know anything about it but hey...i wont turn down a free game. i found it to be very confusing. i barely played it so i odnt know how the gameplay is...but it's only for a trek fan not for an rpg/action gamer like myself.
3,"Nice try, but too hard.",Only get this game if you like the feeling of wanting to smash your DS into tiny little pieces.
4,Where's the strategy?,"I won't comment on the accuracy of the Star Trek canon in this game but if you are considering purchasing it consider the following: This game is not particularly stragetic in nature, you serve as the captain of a starship and you engage in intergalatic dogfights with multiple allies and multiple bogies. These battles are conducted in a two-dimensional environment rather than a true aerial environment aka there is no vertical plane only horizontal navigation.Because of the limited engagement environment this game quickly becomes repetitive as you deploy the same ""Tactics"" over and over (blast the same shield over and over until you can breach their hull). I feel the game would be better served if it lived up the hype on the box by allowing you to create fleets of starships and strategically deploying them, but if you prefer flight simulators this game serves as a reasonable approximation of one."
3,This captain needs to learn how to delegate,"Pros:--- You are the captain of a Federation star ship--- The federation starships are powerful enough to put up a fight--- There is a diplomacy systemCons:--- The captain literally controls EVERYTHING on the ship, right down to firing phasers. And there is literally no delegation of responsiblities to your crew. This means that you are in control of steering the ship and firing your weapons. So you'd better be good at multitasking."
3,Star Trek: Tactical Assault DS,It's an ok game. I like Star Trek so I bought this to play during commercial breaks. It takes some getting used too but plays like a digital version of RISK.
3,. . . but who is Stephen Foster?,"This video features many of Foster's hits, which for music lovers is great, however, if you are looking for a biography about the early composer, this is not it. In fact, there is nothing revealing or unique that tells you anything about Foster's private life. The movie ends with him living happily-ever-after, which in reality, he died pennyless at age 37. The movie is light and entertaining, and was probably popular for its time. Typical Hollywood treatment. To learn more about the man, see PBS's American Experience, Stephen Foster: America's First Great Songwriter."
3,Surprisingly bland,"I was so excited about this CD: The title, artists involved and occasion all promised to bring me something extra special. Particularly after the last Olympic shows, which were so spectacular.I was left mostly bewildered.How could so much white bread come out of such richness was all I could think?It is almost as though all the reality and truth were blended out and what is left is chatty and upbeat.Too bad.I think it is worth buying only if you are studying music, so you can try to understand what NOT to do in collaboration."
3,not a group,"This recording has some merit, but as a whole, it is not very cohesive. It is obvious that these are capable musicians, but it's also obvious that they had not spent any real time playing together before this recording session. It is loaded with weak spots both in time, and melodic thought. Lacking direction and common musical goals, it is pretty insipid, and leaves me feeling I've wasted my time with it. Throughout most of the tracks, the players resort to playing loudly what they are used to playing, and very little communication takes place. Sometimes it sounds like very little listening to each other is happening, or that maybe they were having a hard time hearing each other.Good players.....Bad setting.....mediocre music."
5,Energic happy music!,"I bought the album the first days after release, and I have learned to enjoy it more and more. All the tracks are delightful - Afrodisia is right now my favorite - Frank lacy's trombone solo really kicks."
3,Unbiased and sometimes informative book,"First the good:This book is an unbiased account of Globalization and it's effect in several different countries. Each section is written by a different Graduate student from that area of the world. Each account gives a first hand look at how the people of that coutnry view globalization through the eyes of one of it's members.Second, the Bad:As stated earlier these are grad students writing these passages so it's hit and mis with these articles. For instance the One on China I found to be very informative and well written while the one on India was poorly written and read more like a promotion for the writers religion.This book is definately worth the time because it doesn't say Globalization is good or evil, it just gives unbiased information. Just take some of the passages as what they are, graduate study level work"
5,"Simply put, the best industrial Christian metal rock album","I highly recommend this group! This band is so underrated. THey deserve more attention then they currently get. Being one of the few Industrial/metal/dark techno/Christian groups out there they have a finely produced debut album. Their lyrics are most definentally Christian and very deep and fun to listen to. All their songs are perfect and a joy to listen to with the exception of ""Unmade"" which doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. Another high plus about it is that it has three hidden songs added to the already beautiful ear candy. FInely crafted metal/industrial/christian stuff. It's hard to label them and they call themselves Post Nuclear Industrial Rock. THe best thing about them is that they are Christian because there are hardly any bands that are Christian that explore the Indutrial rock scene. I'd give it 11 out of 10 stars"
4,Trent Reznor can keep feeling sorry for himself...,"This band rocks the house. Though one may be tempted to think that this is a NIN wanna be group, that isn't true. After listening to NIN for years, I can say that this band has similarities, but it is much different in it's ""feel"" and especially in their lyrics. While Trent continues his ""downward spiral into hell"", these guys are rockin' into a more hopeful glympse of truth and reality of knowing and living for G-d, as opposed to hatred of G-d and perversion of reality in a twisted state of self-worship. Overall I'm sick of hearing Reznor's whining... we all have pain, and I sympathize, but Reznor enjoys the pain so he can whine about it and make $$$ off it. But do I need to say anything else about NIN... I'll listen to my Massivivid CD instead, thank you."
2,Trent Reznor is jealous of none...,"I'm sorry, but for those of you who are thinking that Trent Reznor would be jealous over this, I would seriously have to disagree. Just about every song sounds the same. I hear alot of fuzzy guitars and ""techno"" stuff. I don't know what to call it. I'm only giving it two stars because the singer sounds kind of attractive sometimes. ...And what's with the goggles? And if you think THIS is better than Nine Inch Nails, you don't even deserve to experience The Trent. Just give away your copy of The Fragile, Pretty Hate Machine, The Downward Spiral, or etc. to some poor soul who really deserves it, then go and listen to this and Creed. I guess I'm just a sucker for utterly depressing lyrics about depressing things. I don't know. I'm not your boss; buy it if you want. I'm not God."
4,A great dictionary for middle schoolers,"Fairly inclusive and readable print, but small enough to fit in a desk, locker or back pack. I've bought two; one for my daughter and my godson."
4,Solid dictionary and portable,"Merriam-Webster's Intermediate Dictionary, 1998 edition , is a good dictionary for students 11 - 14 years old.It claims a coverage of 65 000 entries ( definitions, spellings andpronunciations )selected on the basis of their occurrence in textbooks andin other school materials in all subjects.Word history paragraphs with many formal etymologies are found ; as well, paragraphs on differences in meaning that help keep synonyms distinct.Even usage notes are included . Prefixes as well with a list of wordscarrying that prefix.Content is up-to-date with words from the field of computers, technology and medicine.It also provides 1 000 illustrations but in black and white.it is surprisingly not heavy for its 940 pages and can be held inthe palm of one hand."
1,Disappointed,This makes very small raviolis and it doesn't seal good - a lot of the filling falls out upon cooking. I even tried to get my money back and couldn't!!
5,Ravioli attachment for Atlas 150 Pasta Machine,Very pleased with this machine & ravioli attachment. The ravioli attachment makes 3 rows of ravioli at a time. Just love having fresh pasta. It is so much better than store bought. The machine is very easy to use & just wish I had bought this sooner. A real joy to serve homemade pasta!!I am very pleased with everything that I have bought from amazon & I like the fact that I don't have to go to several websites to get what I want.
4,Clowns and Wagon Chow.,"In this edition of the Scooby-Doo book series, the Mystery Inc. gang visits a rodeo operated by Bucky McCoy, the world-famous yodeling cowboy. Fred is one of Bucky's biggest fans and he wants to introduce the gang to his childhood hero. However, Bucky's rodeo is having financial problems and a malignant rodeo clown tries to scare everyone away. It's up to Scooby and the gang to solve the mystery and save the rodeo.This entry into the series reads like an average book and since the mystery doesn't really involve a scary monster, the story isn't as exciting as other Scooby-Doo tales."
5,I remember everything so vividly!!,I read this book almost two years ago. Since then I have read quite a number of novels but Flowers in the Blood still stands out as an all time favorite. I rememeber the characters and the story so vividly. Dinah Sasson's strong character and her ethics. The story was even more appealing to me since my husband is from India and is Jewish. Events and situations in this novel coincided with many of the stories I had heard from him and his family during their period in India. Very good story.
5,Flowers In the Blood-Gay Courter,Flowers in the Blood a timeless book which i've enjoyed many timesThis book should identify the author with whom we associateThe Midwife
5,One of my all-time favourite books,"I have bought this book 3 times. I have read it twice, gave it away three times, and will buy it again for Kindle just because - who knows, I may read it again. I gave my last paperback to one of my friends who moved to India for a time and is Jewish (like the protagonist in the book) as a going-away gift and she has told me she loved it too, and how it helped her experience in India. But you don't have to be living in India or Jewish to enjoy this book. You just have to appreciate exceptional historical fiction and are interested in learning about areas of history that are not usually written about in fiction and like to be spell-bound for a few hours."
5,very interesting story,"Very easy and interesting reading. Learned a lot about the opium trade, India and China in a deightful read. Went to Shanghai afterwards and it made it so much more interesting."
4,Tasty!,"While I'd heard of Willie Bobo, it wasn't until I read somewhere that Santana covered his ""Evil Ways"" (written by one of his band members) that I was sufficiently intrigued and plunked down fifteen for this great, fun, greasy set of latin-jazz r&b/soul lounge music. It's got the feel of a lava lamp, the smell of patchouli, the hip of Peter Sellers' ""The Party"" written all over it. It's just a notch above Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass (and believe me, in Keswick, I've seen every sixties album Herbie put out at garage sales!) and a level below Pancho Sanchez. That said, it's immensely fun and disarmingly toe-tapping. I repainted a backyard deck while listening to this CD last summer and it made the experience ENJOYABLE! A forgotten slice of sixties pop. Here's where you catch up..."
3,Not bad but not good either!,"I've listened to Willie Bobo for years but was a little disappointed in this particular arrangmemt.I'm still looking for ""Fairy Tales for Two"" can't seem to find it, but If any of you do.. You WON""T be disappointed..."
4,Great customer service,I received the product quickly and it did not work. I called them and they had a replacement out right away. The second one works great. They also paid for the shipping for me to return the first one.
3,interesting little horror flick,"This is the tragic tale of three children, all born during a solar eclipse. Unfortunatly, saturn is blocked during the eclipse. Saturn, as we all know is responsible for one's moral conscience. What does this mean for our three solar babies? Well, with a title like Bloody Birthday, its not to hard to figure out. Before their 10th birthday, the kids decide to start killing some folks. The town goes in a frenzy as they try to figure out who is killing their citizens.Overall, this picture looks good considering its age. The DVD doesn't look much different than the vhs. The acting is pretty decent for this type of film with the ringleader of the boys, 'Kurtis' standing out. Mind you, i kind of got tired of kurtis trying over and over to kill the neighbours. Do the job already or move on to someone else! Your bumbling and fumbling lessenned the fear factor considerably! oh well. A solid, if not spectacular disk."
1,Bloody Birthday,"Typical and boring,3 littlebrats who are out killing,let's see how many Horror movies Have I seen where as usual kids have no souls or no mercy and they inflict harm?Yes it happens sadly in the real world but why not a different plot or story?the movie is drawn out and except for Julie Brown the movie is mainly a snoozer."
2,Kids Gone Wild,"After watching Bloody Birthday I was confused why Turner Classic Movie channel thought this film was worthy of a late Friday night viewing. It kind of The Bad Seed times three, but made cheaper than a Roger Corman movie. These kids were no more blood thirsty than what you would find at your local young Republican meeting. The only moment the film delivered even the slightest amount of a chill is when the film's heroine sharpens hedge shears on bench grinder without wearing safety glasses. Not that the whole film was a bore, there was Julie Brown in her prime performing an entertaining striptease. Which helps explains why some of the Amazon reviewers awarded the film five stars."
2,Bland,"I purchased this DVD based on the reviews. I am a fan of 80's horror, so I thought this would be a good movie to put in my collection, wrong! It was quite boring, and it was not made as well as say the Friday The 13th series. It has that grainy look, the cheesy music, poor acting and the it's overall a slow movie. Not impressed, it's not scary and it's not funny, it's stupid."
4,Bloody BIRTHDAY,"THE MOVIE WAS GOOD THE PLOT WAS GOOD THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS MY GRANDKIDS LIKE WATCHING THESE KIND OF MOVIES W/ME AND THERE WAS WAY TO MUCH NUDITY AND SEX FOR THEM TO SEE.THE MOVIE INV/KIDS DOING THE KILLING,SO THIS MOVIE SHOULD ONLY BE VIEWED BY ADULTS."
4,"""Birthday. Bloody Birthday""","Bloody Birthday is an interesting killer kids movie that is like The Omen multiplied by three. It's about three children who were all born on the same night in the same town during a lunar eclipse. Now, they are psychotic killers who are racking up a pretty impressive body count.I liked Bloody Birthday moreso than The Omen and Children of the Corn. In fact, I think it's the best killer kids flick, other than 2009's Orphan. And I liked the exploitation elements. There is a lot of nudity in this film, including a topless dance scene with Julie Brown."
4,Somethings Very Wrong With Little Cindy,"This is a great forgotten little slasher from the early 80's, 3 elementary age kids on a killing spree with zero remorse or conscience, entertaining, good pace, good kills, suspenseful, even a little skin. You don't see kids as serial killers in flicks much, so for me it's a fun unique addition to my collection."
4,Bloody Birthday Review,"Saw this on TCM late at night. They actually show boobies in one quick scene. Odd little movie, with cold Blooded kids (not related) born at the same time of an eclipse. They are evil little 10 year old brats. Fun movie for Haloween, if your kids are old enough to not be shocked at seeing one quick boobies scene. What scarey movie doesn't show Boobies anymore? It's a staple of the genre. I would recommend this movie for people who collect horror movies. This one is a cult classic."
4,SHOCKED At How Good This Was!,"I was aware of this film, but I have always avoided it because I figured ""who wants to watch a movie with a bunch of bratty kids who can't act""? Last night, I was bored and it just so happened to be on Turner Classic Movies so I started watching it. I was blown away at what a great ""evil child"" movie this was! I would easily put it up there with 'Village of the Damned' (the original of course) and 'The Omen' (do I have to say also the original ; damn there's so many remakes out there). The kids are really good actors. The evil deeds they do, come across as a normal everyday thing to these little psychopaths. A lot of familiar faces here and most of them play their roles very well. I really don't understand why some reviewers give this only one star unless they think the way I originally did about kids in movies. I almost rated this film 5 stars, but it isn't quite to the level that the afore mentioned evil kiddies films were, but it's close."
4,Happy memories of childhood heros,"This tape is more than just stories told by one of the greatest players ever to walk onto a field, it's memories of events many of us witnessed in our youth as told by one of the participants in the making of history. It makes you laugh and then makes you sad to realize that the likes of players and people like him may never be around again."
4,"Watchband Lizard, navy blue","Beautiful band! Very true navy color. Easy to attach to watch due to special post, no tools needed. That was fantastic! Only down side to the band is it is a little too short in length. I can still wear it butit is set on the second to the last hole on the band. My wrist is not that large."
5,great new work on labor,"Admirable example of ethnographic methods to reveal the critical participation of African Americans in the labor movement. Needleman provides new evidence that black leaders were instrumental in breaking down barriers of racial discrimination. In this work, Needleman deftly examines how African Americans took on powerful labor leaders and built autonomous African American organizations to encourage desegregation and the development of inter-racial alliances. The writer is clearly among the leading ethnographers in the field, and this book makes a solid contribution to understanding the movement for racial justice in America. Highly recommended."
3,Great book-poor construction,I've owned 2 of them and although the content is great the books fall apart soon after beginning to use
5,Who molded you?,Understanding yourself by understanding your family really relieves pressure and guilt for why you feel the you do. What an eyeopener! Great book!
5,To know and understand,"Florence Littauer's explanation and examples of personalities has not only proven helpful with family,friend and business relationships but as an educator, I have found it exceedingly effective in the classroom."
3,Good ideas,"Its a good book, with great info about people and relationships. Very useful in dealing with others in relationships and understanding others."
3,WESTERN HILLSIDE STRANGLER from TUCSON AZ,"I GREW UP IN THAT HOOD AND FOUND IT ODD THAT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE FLOWIN FROM THE HOOD. NONE THE LESS, A VERY NICE ALBUM. I GOT A COPY RIGHT HERE IN THE ROOM WITH ME, YA DIG?"
5,nice aps c-800 zoom,"i bought this camera, in japan..4 weeks ago wile on vacation..and i like this camera better than all my fimed camerasi like the 3 piture sizes and all the great features.like were you print on your pictures.weddinds,b-dayindependents day, fathers day...exc..the only thing is the film is expensive to buy&develope.;but ver all i love it.."
4,Glad I bought it,"I do like the camera, it is very easy to use and is a nice balance between small/lightweight with good features, nice zoom, and an affordable price. But there are a few things I'd prefer if I could pick and choose. I don't like the fact that the camera's autofocus gets to decide what to focus on. The only way you get to pick something to focus on is if it's in the dead center of the picture (their ""spot focus""). Also, I don't like it that the default setting for an APS picture size is the middle 4 x 7 picture. I prefer the traditional 4 x 6 for most of my pictures and it's hard to always to remember to change it. But like I said, I do like the camera overall, and would recommend it as a good buy."
3,Premature Rewind,"After 10 weeks, the C800 began to rewind prematurely, losing shots already taken. Kodak has a repair facility, no instant exchange, and there is a 3-4 week wait according to the technical representative I talked to. The pictures I got with the C800 are great, but there is no way of knowing when the thing will rewind. I have had a 600 Advantix, not as much zoom or as many features but that camera never gave me a minutes trouble and the pictures were just as good. Maybe a lesson learned."
1,Brown Lines,"I have purchased two of these monitors and they will go in the trash bin. Samsung has not been helpful in repairing and I will not buy or recommend thier monitors to anyone. It is an obvious circuit board production flaw and they should make it right but haven't. Brown lines flash or flicker or the whole screen turns brown once the monitor warms up, a sharp rap on the top will make them go away for awhile. I must get a bigger hammer. ;-)"
1,Never buy anything Samsung!,"I bought one of these and within a few months, had problems. Well after calling customer care, they told me they would send out a new one and then pay to return the old one. Well, this didn't happen. They want me to pay the return shipping now (wouldnt have returned it in the first place if they would have told me this) and will not admit it was their fault. Tried to get the information to make a complaint to the company, and the supervisor gives me a bogus number. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING SAMSUNG AGAIN!!!"
1,Unreliable,"As said before ""Upward geometric bowing of the image is also noticeable and cannot be adjusted with the user controls"" very annoying I returned it once thinking it was just a defect with one. Well needless to say same problem, then the second one was even worse. I frequently get lines across the screen distorting the image, which go away when I move it around. 140 bucks for this?"
1,"Pretty good picture, but what's up with the brown lines?","I thought I was getting some sort of interference on my monitor, but after reading the other reviews here it's obvious that this monitor is defective. The lines do go away when you smack it on the side, but I'm getting tired of doing that 3 or 4 times a day, and I only use it in the evenings.After reading reviews of other Samsung monitors, it appears the problem is widespread. Some people have gotten decent warranty service, others have not. I'll just replace it with another brand eventually."
4,Wonderful puzzle for the curious and energetic,"This is one of my favourite metallic puzzles.Its simple, sturdy and symmetric design made it my figit toy of choice while studying/reading. Each piece is slightly smaller than the palm of your hand making it easy to manipulate even when not paying much attention. The metal is also strong enough to resist malforming in those frustrating moments when you think you've got it, if only you push a little harder...If I had to make a complaint about this puzzle, it would be that it makes more noise than most while playing around with it.I will definitely be looking into similar puzzles by ThinkFun."
4,Tough,"This thing comes separated and you have to put it together and then try to take it apart. I put it together in like two minutes. I still, after maybe a year still have not gotten it apart. But, I will keeping trying..."
5,"Trdndy, fashionable, excellent fabric","This coat is of excellent fabric well tailored. Very warm and way lightweight.Only thing is that I found out it darker, comparing how it looked on my screen (had ordered olive), but that's a minor bug.I grabbed it while on Black Friday sale."
2,Disappointing...,"I read about what a crap game this was but because I loved the Animaniacs and I missed their zany ways, I thought I would give this a go anyway! The controls are awkward and I ended up getting stuck somewhere. I attempted more than a few times but this game brought me no joy. For someone as positive and easy to please as me, even I have to agree with the critics!"
4,great music from outstanding musicians,"This is a great recording from truly good musicians. The selection of songs is fantastic. Among the best are South rampart street parade and Sweet Georgia Brown. If you like traditional music,you will love this recording."
1,Very disappointing,Really not much of a Christmas album. A few really great songs/performances and many others seem unrelated to Christmas. The most disappointing thing was hearing these great voices attempt to perform traditional light hearted Christmas songs. It just falls flat. I'd recommend you listen to ALL of the samples before deciding to buy.
1,Did they practice at all for this?,"Maybe I'm too critical, but this is horrible and worse than a high school concert. I think the person who wrote that it sounded like a Saturday Night Live skit is right on. Hey, maybe we should call them up and have them do it!Anyway, there are times the singers rush the orchestra, they time cutoffs poorly, they aren't synchronized, they mess up the tempo, etc. Not the orchestra - the singers. It sounds like an impromptu concert where they are holding the sheet music in front of their eyes for the first time and are recording it in one take. And it's true, to hear an American folk song sung in an operetic voice just sounds wrong - and it is wrong. I bought this for myself and now I'm using it for a White Elephant gift at work."
1,Let's rehearse,"One of the lousiest I've heard in years. I plan to return this CD as a protest. Not because it was not a well made recording --technically. But, because the tenors obviously had not even sight-read the music before trying to sing it. I wish there was a lower rating than one star. Minus 3 stars sounds right."
2,Boringly Dull,"I am a huge fan of ALL of these guys ie; The Three Tenors. I am not a snob when it comes to music, I sit back and relax and enjoy. But man oh man, this was woeful ! Singing out of synch with the orchestra, exceptionally poor english, the wrong words even to one of the songs. No, sorry boys but this was a boo boo CD !!!!"
5,A Celebration of Christmas,"I believe that this CD is superb. I disagree with earlier reviewers who say American folk songs should be sung a certain way. I am not a regular listener to opera music, however, The Three Tenors are powerful and masterful on this musical selection -- a joy for anyone who is interested in music. For my own part, I have found new meanings and a greater appreciation for the songs on this CD, and I think others will too. I highly recommend this item to those who would like to diversify their Christmas music collection, as well as their musical tastes."
5,wonderful,they are wonderful singers a delight to the ears and doing Christmas music made Christ mas even better
3,"Good Listening, weak percussion- Support the effort","Entertaining songs , real good guitar playing for us on this cd.I am a percussionist since my youth, I am so disappointed with these weak conga players some bands and artist's use, they have very little if any foundation of percussion presentation.Why these conga banger's play drum rhythm's is beyond me, sounds so weak.Ronnie has some wonderful tracks here, I can only imagine what this band would sound like with talent on drums and percussion,although a bit empty sounding at times, the drive is there and the compassion of Ronnie's love for music. Well worth listening to and supporting the artist.Jonny Conga , Santa Cruz"
4,Color of Love -- Broadcasters,"Short and to the point -- this is one sweet set of songs. Easy to listen to, easy to drift along with the riffs. db"
4,Ronnie Pays Tribute,"This is a great CD! Ronnie pays tribute to his influences such as Carlos Santana (you would swear he was on the CD!), Peter Green and others. The CD is most instruments except for the tender 'Everyday Kind of Man' sung by Greg Allman, a very underrated blues singer. Lots of different styles and tempos on the album. You will not be disappointed. Also check out Ronnie's excellent Language of Soul CD. Nice to see a local boy do so well. Ronnie is certain one of the best blues guitarist out there today. Buy this CD and enjoy."
3,OK but not his best,"Ronnie Earl is a bit in and out for me. His blues stuff is brilliant, his West Coast style jazz/rock a bit ordinary. So it is for this album - the blues tracks are great, the others so-so. Previous Bullseye albums like Blues & Ballads, and later TELARC stuff like RE & Friends are better."
3,Fluff. Common Sense. But still has content.,"The first half of the book contains repetitive reasons on why likeability will get you far in all areas of life. All these examples are repeated for the first half of the book.The main point of the book is that to increase likeability, you need to increase 4 things:1. Friendliness2. Relevance3. Empathy4. RealnessAll the content on how to actually increase them sound like common sense, but then again they're not bad. Don't expect a huge miracle pill, but expect to increase your likeability some."
4,Likeability Factor,"I enjoyed reading The Likeability Factor and would recommend it to my friends and colleagues who have relationship issues. I found the book helpful in my relationships with friends, neighbors and co-workers."
2,Wish I liked this book,This book was not graet as I thought it would be it was to repetative for me and I felt like I was at a convention.
2,Obvious Advice,"I bought this book for insight and someone else's well-thought out perspective. What I got was obvious advice, drizzled on at the end of 100 pages of fluff. I say 100 pages, because the first 100 pages are dedicated to explaining why likeability is helpful to you, me, and everyone else in society. If we didn't already know this, we wouldn't be interested in the book, now would we? The next 100 pages essentially says be friendly, revelant, and that brings about 'realness.' The only 'realness' I see here is that there is the lack of intriguing insight.The bottom line is if you're a rude social outkast, then this book might be for you. If you're looking to actually learn something beyond the rudimentary, basic, advice of 'be friendly,' will not find it in 'The Likeability Factor,' which ironically is only mildly likeable as a book."
3,"Great concept, but a boring read","As I write this, I feel ""unlikable"". I wholeheartedly agree with Tim and his concept of getting ahead and having a better existence by putting out genuine likeability vibes. The concept is not new, but I enjoyed some of the statistics anyway. I just think the book was boring. He covers study after study to back up his claims, but I felt it lacked with personal testimonies and heart felt true stories. It reads a lot like a college text book, only the answers are all in the first 25 pages, instead of the back."
3,"Good, but could be more detailed","I purchased this book with the intention of using it in an employability class. The author spent more time prooving that likeability matters than helping improve the likeability factor. Everyone has worked with people they hated, the impact of likeability is something we live with. The language is clear and accessible for high school level readers.His web site made him look like a dynamic speaker. I called to inquire about booking the author for a group of students. The staff that operated could not have been more unlikeable. They were dismissive and rude. A little bit ironic that the representation of author of likeabilty have apparantly not read his book."
3,Likeability Review,"This book is interesting, but I became exhausted reading the last chapter. I'd have to devote my entire waking life to becoming ""likeable"". Maybe I could use it, but I just don't have that sort of time. Perhaps a little less detail would have been sufficient for a self-help book."
3,"A good magazine article, not a book","I thought the book had a good message but, was very simplistic. The message of the book is, be nice, and nicer people get farther. There are loads of examples, including one at the beginning about some guy who's assistant quits and a whole bunch of other things happen because he is not likeable. Then, there a bunch of anecdotes from research studies about likeable people getting far (these stories all seem legit, but, you have to take the authors word about them). finally, we get some advice about how to be more likeable.all in all, probably some good advice, that probably didn't need 200 or so pages worth of text. . . and really, its common sense stuff anyway."
3,A little more detail in some places,"The first parts of it, being friendly and such, are pretty basic. Of course being friendly makes you likeable. But where I got stuck was in ""empathy."" Empathy is problematic, I've discovered, and I'd have liked to see more on managing or balancing that empathy. Somtimes you have to step back when your empathy results in someone taking problems that really require intensive, long-term professional help and trying to make their problems yours, too - or cling to you to solve them. It's an oppressive, clingy kind of negative result that the book sets you up for but then fails to address."
4,A Great Message,"This kind of message may seem obvious but it is amazing how important it is to be likeable! It's not always easy and I do think it takes practise, especially in business. Often we are so busy to get all the work done that we can forget to take time to really be nice - especially when situations are chaotic.Tim is on the right track and I look forward to his next book."
5,Excellent book!,"The Intro to this book hit the nail on the head for me and I recommend this book to everyone. As an actor, I had unknowingly blended my on-screen bad guys with my off-screen friendly self. When my friends became more distant, I knew it was time to get back on track to being likable again. The 4 stoplights analogy clarified my gameplan to being likable again. The references and citations in this book makes it a must read for the analytical types (like me)."
5,What more can be said?,"Really what more can be said? Every poem is a good poem- hmmm, perhaps that is why Keillor calls them... Good Poems? I am a blue collar poem reader. I don't want to understand the free form or debate why the writer used a certain word over another, I like poems that take me away to a familiar memory or experience and most of these poems do just that. It is a book best experienced by candle light with a special someone and/or a great bottle of wine.Thank you Garrison Keillor for another fantastic book of good poems."
4,poetry,The Conde Nast Traveler Book of Unforgettable Journeys: Great Writers on Great PlacesThe Conde Nast Traveler Book of Unforgettable Journeys: Great Writers on Great Places
3,"Good Poems are good, but Garrison Keillor didn't write them","I bought this book for my daughter-in-law, a sixth grade English teacher.I thought that the poems were written by Keillor, however, this is not the case. He collected the poems, and his choices are good. But the book title is accurate, they are GOOD poems, not great ones. I think it would have been more helpful if the purchaser knew that Keillor didn't write the poems. The title makes it look like it is his work."
3,Best Poetry Essay Ever,"The content is more limited by theme than Keillor's other anthologies, yet I dog-eared about 30 poems to go back to. What's outstanding is Garrison's ""Introduction""--it is the best thing written about poetry EVER. It will change how you feel about poetry. I use it in workshops I give. It makes me proud to be a poet [...]."
4,Suprisingly Good,"I am not a big poem reader. In fact, I'd rather not read any of them, but I had to get this book for an English class I am taking and was pleasantly surprised at how nice some of the poems are. Many of them touched me in some way or another. Of course there were some poems I disliked but that's just how collections of anything works. Would recommend to any who reads poems or anyone trying to get into reading poems."
5,Poems for every occasion,"Inspired collection. You can find something for any occasion here, beautifully grouped. Just what you would expect from Garrison Keillor. I leave this book out for people to peruse, and they appreciate the opportunity to gain insight from a brief encounter with a poem. Read one (if you can limit yourself) a day to be refreshed yourself."
4,Great Item,"This was given to me as a gift and it's a great item. I like how it comes with just about everything your newborn will need. Even toys (the keys) and hangers. The clothing material is good but could be better. But I like that the outfits all have matching accessories. Bibs, blankets, hats, booties, burb towels.Definitely a great gift idea!"
5,Big Gift Packed Into A Small Box,I purchased this for a baby shower. The new Mom loved it! It has 24 great essentials packed into a small box. A perfect start for the new baby.
4,great music but....,"I love the cd. I used to have it when I was a kid. And under normal circumstances I would rate this a 5 but because I got it with a cracked case, I am slightly disappointed. Other than that, I'm happy with it. It's a good buy."
5,Jammin' from Long Distance,These fools are the coolest! They rock the party and trip like I do. JD shake what ya mama gave ya! These guys really know how to jam and encourage others with their musac! Keep rockin' for tha Lord homies! PEACE Coolio
1,QEP wet saw blade,"I bought this blade because I have a rail saw from QEP that for some strange reason, requires an eight inch blade. I have not yet used it, but after a half hour of swapping out blades, I noticed that the NEW blade is eccentric. that means the hole in the middle is not in the dead center middle. real crappy quality control. I hope it doesn't screw up the saw too much. This was the second blade the vendor sent me, the first being a ten inch blade that didn't fit at all. I will sell the rail saw before buying another QEP blade from Amazon."
2,A gothic attempt at Fall of the House of Usher.,"""Dark Interval"" is one of Joan Aiken's earlier novels, and is her fourth ""adult"" novel. It is a step down from the previous work of hers, ""Beware of the Bonquet"". This novel follows a young wife, who is recovering psycologically from her amnesia following the tragic death of her three-year old child. Her family is full of malice, and doesn't wish for her to recover. The woman then finds herself increasly drawn into a plot by a Eastern European emigree to keep his life private at all costs. Aiken does confuse us slightly with his name. Is it Harry Lupac, or Hari Lupac? Anyway, the writing seems to be slowed down by the overall mood of despair and rotting."
4,Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure ablum review.,This is a good 1980's sounding album. My two favorite tracks off of it is In Time and Walk away.
3,It's Excellent!,"Anyone who's seen this movie more than once should recognize a few of these songs. Boys And Girls Are Doing It, I Can't Break Away, and Two Heads Are Better Than One are all good and catchy. There's also the Extreme song that was semi-popular anyway. Otherwise this is all old 80's metal bands that are currently serving fries somewhere right now. If this is your era, or your favorite movie, pick this up. It'll go great with your Wayne's World and Beavis And Butthead soundtracks."
5,Best ROCK compilation EVER !!!,"If you like rock and do not have this cd you're a fool. Sorry about the harsh words but simply put, this is the best rock compilation ever!I get goosebumps to almost every song on this cd.Here's the tracks that give me goosebumps:1.Extreme - Play with me2.Vital Signs - The boys and the girls4.Tora Tora - Dancing with a gypsy5.Shark Island - Father Time (this one is so unvelievable)6.Big Pig - I can't break away (another super song)7.Shark Island - Dangerous10.Power Tools - Two heads are better than one (aaaaah)Get this cd and have a great time."
4,A Classic Soft Rock Compendium,"Like soft rock? You'll like this. There are some cool tunes in the 80s rock genre here - 'Play with Me' by Extreme and 'Two Heads...' by Power Tool (featuring Dweezil Zappa, incidentally). Amazing ballads - 'Walk Away' by Bricklin and 'In Time' by Robbie Robb. If you like stuff by Bon Jovi or 'Jump'-era Van Halen you should seriously consider this thang, man. In total a very good album for those who love the music of the time, or the film. Remember the scene with Beethoven rocking out on the keyboard at the mall? - on the album. Remember where Bill and Ted end up in the future and the futurians are standing around waving manically? - on the album. Get it. Soon."
4,"Excelent ( Air Guitar bit, Screech screech screeeeech)",This is a quality soundtrack to follow up a quality film. The only bad thing I can say about it is that you dont get the song Bill and Ted hear in the futre. The one about dancing in the street. Its a top quality soundtrack a must have for every one that was born before 1990. Buy it now
4,eye opener,Most of the things in this book are what you would suspect them to be show children love at all times and be loving to family show love not just say it. But some you don't even know that you are missing you always just assume with doing those things that kids know how you feel which isn't always the case.
5,the best child-rearing book ever,I first read this book when a teenager and it made me cry - a real discovery of all the things that went wrong...now a mom myself I'm gonna keep it at my bedside to remind myself about the miracle of love.hugs an kisses everyone!
1,How to really love your child,"I had a lot of difficulty getting into this book. I tried but could not finish it. I read about 1/3 of the book. While some of the ideas were good, I thought a lot were not very realistic. I could not recommend it."
5,Fantastic advice,I'm in my 50's now and my children are adults. We raised them using this book for guidance. It is spot on. I recommend it. I bought this one for a 30 year old employee with two little boys. This is probably the 4th or 5th time I have bought it for someone with little kids. The younger the better. Follow this book and it will make a huge difference for you and your children.
5,Very helpful.,"Well written and insightful. This book give many useful insights into family dynamics, and is beneficial for those who want to strengthen their family values."
4,How to really love your child,"Of course I thought I really loved my child before I got this book but I have to admit that I wasn't getting the message through to her. Now I understand that I need to really take more time to communicate with her, listen to her point of view and give her my undivided attention. I think Campbell's message is worth putting into practice. I highly recommend this book for any parent."
5,"Balanced, biblical, and wholesome","I think this is an excellent book because it steers away from the external performace-orientation of some Christian books. These books sometimes almost view raising a child like training a dog. The whole focus is on getting the child to do the right thing, to obey. This title also steers away from the other extreme forms of parenting--the child is a delicate, fragile piece of glass that must be coddled, never contradicted or criticized, given whatever he or she wants, and praised for each and every thing they do.Campbell moves to a more biblical focus. He shows that if you build a healthy love relationship, you can exercise appropriate discipline in love and children will actually appreciate it and come to view it as what it is--the most loving thing you could do for them.-Dennis McCallum, authorOrganic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"
5,READ IT!,New to parenting or frustrated that your kids are not obeying? You may be missing a key element to parenting...filling their emotional tank. This is a quick and easy read with great insight on truly loving our children so that they will respond to our correction and receive our love.
4,ABAP PROGRAMMING,"THE BOOK IS GOOD, BUT LIKE MOST SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING BOOKS, SOME OF THE CODE IS INCORRECT OR NO LONGER WORKS. Be careful in reading as there are some typhographical errors in the book. I feel the book should supply more examples and a few more quizzes and exercises in detail."
3,"""Heavy"" book","Very analytical. Long sentence, long paragraph writing. It is helpfull only if you read it from the first to last page. Not a reference. More like bed time book"
2,This isn't an useful reference.,This book informed me of ABAP/4 in detail. But you can't use this book either as a reference or an introduction. Probably this book is only for those who have some experience of ABAP/4 programing.
2,This book is a poor learning tool.,"I purchased this book to prepare for our company's move to SAP R/3 and to learn more about the ABAP/4 language. The book was originally written in German and translates poorly into English. Some of the programming examples do not show the resulting output. One example contained German wording (for vendor and product). If someone had exposure to R/2 or other earlier versions of SAP, this book might be useful, but for persons with no exposure to SAP, this book is a poor learning tool even though the author is quite knowledgable about ABAP/4 and SAP R/3."
1,Very faulty,"I'm an SAP trainer - this book has a lot of mistakes, better buy ""ABAP objects"" from SAP Press/Galileo"
2,Still trying to figure this out,The book would be good for someone who has started the programming of ABAP/4. However if you are a new comer to this you will find it difficult and having to flip to this chart on page ?? then to this chart on page ?? makes it even more difficult. If you want to learn the basics this is not the book to buy. After I learn somemore in the programming stage of my training I might make a new review.But if your a beginner to SAP as I am stay away from this for now!!
3,A very good book but not for beginners,This is a very good book for people who have some prior experience in SAP systems and ABAP. The book is organized into chapters which are not so continuous but each and every chapter explains itself adequately. This book can be used as a good reference material for core programmers of SAP systems.
4,Good one for starters,"The book is a good one for beginners.the topics covered are very comprehensive.For experienced people, the book could be used as a reference in many cases.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
1,damaged,"This rocking fish arrived dirty & ripped. When I called to return, I was giving the run around and a hard time. Don't waste your time with this vendor."
5,Essential for Puppy heads / psychedelic music lovers,This was Cevin Key/Dwayne Goettel's side project(one of many actually) that featured Alan Nelson on vocals. Nelson was a childhood buddy of Key's (he later died of complications arising from advanced diabetes) ...Quirky... occasionally disjointed as one reviewer put it but Key is not a classically trained musician whereas Dwayne was (he also passed away) ...Great ganja and alcohol inspired music alternating between jangly rock and trippy electronica flavored excursions along with Nelson's trippy stream of conscious lyrics and vocal monologues...'highly' recommended ...
4,Memories,"This is Skinny Puppy doing a low-budget project for Nettwork. Let's Fall Out is my favorite track and exemplifies my favorite sound out of SP. Its groove is organic, sturdy and that engineering...! Gah!! In all I really enjoy 3 tracks but keep in mind this was pretty much a one off project. I never saw or heard anything from ""Hilt"" again."
5,Awsome for kids and grown-ups.,"Our 9-year-old saw one of the kids at school play with this. So of course the nagging started as soon as we got home. Fortunately, I remember this puzzle since when I was a kid and had no problem giving in.... :-)Also:- it is inexpensive (unlike the playstation and x-box); which is a huge benefit, since we have 3 kids and things like this have to be bought in triplicate- it is made of metal, so that even our 5-year-old couldn't break it- IT IS GREAT FUN"
3,slight problem,"I love this game and it is well made. However, the tiles do get jammed. I thought if I touched the tiles lightly it would help but it seems to not want to slide easily. That is frustrating. Since I could only know this by opening the package, that seems unfair that it can't be returned."
1,This one is going back.,"There is nothing about this puzzle that is pleasing. I'm going to try and return it, even though I know it is going to be a hassle to do. The numbers felt like they were going to fall out of the puzzle and yet, when you tried to manipulate the metal blocks they would hang up on each other. In addition the size of the puzzle was an utter disappointment and pictures showing on the web are deceiving. I have a plastic puzzle that came out of a cracker-jack box that is bigger and better working than this piece of garbage."
3,The tiles should slide easier,The quality is excellent and the case is a plus. The tiles aren't as easy to slide as they could be for two reasons. The tops of the tiles are too slick to get good friction. It's difficult to move the tiles quickly because they tend to fall out of position and block each other.
1,"Cheaply made, Sharp edges on the back, unsafe","I bought this for my six year old. In the first minute, it got stuck and she was unable to move it. She gave it to me. I fixed it by pressing hard and that's when I noticed a pinch in my thumb. That was coming from the sharp metal edge from the back. At that moment, I decided to put it away. Unsafe for children. Do not move smoothly. Terrible product."
3,"Excellent educational toy, but too expensive","Excellent educational toy, but too expensive in my opinion. You also have to think how to slide the digits as the movement is not smooth. However, I believe it will last forever in the storage in your wardrobe."
3,Not great,"The number tiles feel like loose, and they make rattling noises. I wish it was sturdy. The toy itself feels heavy and sturdy but the tiles take away the overall value. It is a nice game, however. I will look for similar toys of other brands."
2,my review,I had one of these as a kid. This toy was cheaply made. I was dissatisfied with the quality of the product. The numbers are hard tomove around due to the poor quality.
1,Frustrating -- Tiles Don't Move Smoothly,"What a disappointment! When I played with this puzzle in my youth (yes, I admit, it was over 55 years ago), I remember hours of fun as I easily moved the tiles quickly to match the speed of my brain. However, the puzzle I bought for my grandchildren last month seemed defective because the tiles kept getting stuck on their track, thereby making movement slow and difficult. The kids and I were totally frustrated. I thought it was a defect in that particular puzzle so I bought the same puzzle from another bookstore; however, the same problem existed. I am so surprised at the positive reviews for this particular company's game. Yes, the red case is very nice, but I would have preferred that the company spend the extra bucks on a quality puzzle."
5,How To Stump the Video Game Generation!,"Want to stump the video game generation? Order this puzzle and watch them struggle to solve it. This is one puzzle that has been on the market for years, and it hasn't changed for good reason. It doesn't need to change. It can still baffle a new generation."
4,Metal Slide Puzzle Works Well,"Slides smoother than an older version which stuck often. Son likes having the carrying case. Seems enamel and finish will last. Only gave ""4"" because haven't encountered any slide puzzle with perfect sliding action."
4,Great Purchase,"The package arrived in a timely manner, packed well and sparkling new. A smooth transaction. Thanks!"
1,garbage,"this is a piece of garbage, you cannot slide the pieces easy, and it is made poorly. I will never buy from them again."
1,Defective!,I was so excited to give my dad a new game to play so he could quit his obsession with Freecell...he opened it up and seemed intrigued only to find that 1) there was no instruction booklet and 2) there are two 4's and NO 6!!Trying to figure out how to get a refund/new and functioning game.
4,Conan the Magnifcent,"I bought this book during it's first run in print,and found it very enjoyable. the characters had a real feel to them, and the story itself was a smoker! It would be a great thing if Mr. Jordan would write another story with Conan and Eldran! Hey, if you're reading this review Mr. Jordan, try it out."
1,The worst Conan book ever?,"This was a terrible Conan book. When I read Conan, I want and expect blood, death, gore and sex. This book had none of those. If you like Conan, don't read this drivel."
5,as usual . . .,"As usual, something out of print that is simply essential. Drum players, by themselves, should make this collection go platinum. There never was and never will be another drummer like Tony Williams. You must have the classic mid-60s Miles Davis sets for a fuller understanding of his magnificent power, but here are the electrified early star explosions that still reverberate in certain receding precincts, when he set out on his own, armed with ""Jack Johnson"" and ""Bitches Brew,"" the promise of the pre-collapse Sixties idealism, black power and the ""murky corridors of your mind"" . . . and just let fly. Jack Bruce and John McLaughlin and Larry Young and Tony Williams, they all got together and beat a hole in the world that few peered through and fewer are left to forget. At once punishing and awe inspiring."
5,Dreamy,"You want to read , write or just be relax and dream . You can with this cd! perfect and so cool."
5,Great Translation,"Excellent...very inexpensive. Great translation. If you need a copy of the Republic, GET THIS."
3,Create A Community,This is a worthy classic. I saw:How to build the foundation of a community.The way active thinking looks.And More
4,Interesting Classic,"I got in to this book after reading E. Robert Morse'sJustice and Equalityand hearing about the parallels and I was pleasantly surprised. The translation wasn't a very difficult read and there are a lot of valid ideas that are still meaningful today. The wide scope of topics prevents boredom and the read is quick. I was interested in the opening questions- what is Justice and why should we be just? If one can gain material things and social prominence not being just and moreover being unjust, why do it? His answers aren't always filled with perspective, but they do open one's mind. Another good book along these lines is Essays by Michel de Montaigne which is an overview of life from a humanist's perspective."
5,corrections by author,"Publishers blurb implies the book's review of urban history ends with the renissance period--not true!--book covers urbanization through the 20th and into the 21st century! The book mainly covers contemporary urban phenomena--everything beyond the second chapter through the sixteenth and last chaper deals with 19th, 20th, and 21st century urban themes and phenomena. Again, it's a book about modern urban sociology, with only one chapter on ancient, medieval, fuedal, and renaissance urban civilizations. I hope you can correct this misleading and very incomplete description of the books contents. Look at the contents and see for yourself!Dr. Harry Gold, Professor Emeritus, Oakland University"
3,Good enough,Affordable and did the job needed as far as stopping static and proving an extra layer between skirt and tights.
4,nice half slip,Good quality for the price. Vanity Fair makes nice products and this is no exception. It is also true to size and fits me in medium that is my normal size.
5,Great quality,"The skirt is just as advertised. It's a good length, a bit above the knee, and is of good quality. Really great for the cost."
3,Meh - it works...,"I got this to wear under a white sundress. It added another layer so it worked...but, it didn't do a whole lot. It's pretty darn see-through...which kind of defeats the purpose...."
4,small is pretty small,"I am a size five and if I were a six it would give me muffin top, great length, material is soft and not too thick while still providing opaque effect. Works great, would buy another one."
2,Poor quality,"I was not happy with the MP3 player when I recieved it because the slider was broken. I had to send it back for a new one. The second one that I recieved was in excellent condition when I recieved it. My next step...download songs. However, I then realized that you have to use SonicStage 4.0 to move songs from the internet or personal computer onto the player. I was not able to install this program on our main computer and when I called Sony they were no help! I then put the installation disk into an older computer at our house and it worked. Needless to say it is a hassle to have to go through all this work. Finally I got a few songs onto the player, but then I had trouble getting the USB to pop out when I moved the slider. I think that Sony needs to make the player more friendly with other computer programs and work on the slider!"
1,not usable due to SonicStage,"Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each ""artist"" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1.(if you don't believe SonicStage is B A D then google it up or look at the other Sony player reviews since they all use the same SonicStage)"
4,Sony NW-E307 Walkman Bean 1 GB MP3 Player Black,"Great quality product, great sound and excellent design. I'm a little concerned about the sliding cover for the usb connector though. I guess it's not such a great deal!:D"
2,one side does not work,"would have been a great buy, but one side of the audio connection is not working."
5,"Too fragile. One little drop on kitchen linoleum and Poof, its gone!","I wrote a great review on this little bean 2 days ago.I am now editing it.For some reason it wont let me change the amount of stars I gave it. I would now give it 1 star.The darn thing just broke on me. It slipped out of my fingers and actually gently hit the floor ( the cord breaking some of the fall ) and the control stick broke off and the thing is almost useless now.I really think that a mp3 flash player should be more durable. This stinks, I wasted 120 dollars.Time to get an ipod.Mike"
3,I don't like the hold button...,"The bean Mp3 player is really cute in color and shape... but I dont like the way the hold button is on it... It is really annoying especially if you buy the case for it... The ear phones are the worst, they don't hold in when your just sitting there, I can just imagine what would happen if I was in the gym running... However, if you buy the sony MDR-J20 ear phone, they are comfortable and hold pretty well... you won't be able to turn it up to maximun volume it is waaay too high... Oh another thing I want to comment on is the amount of songs that fit on there.... NO WAY does it fit 950 songs! I did an average of the amount of songs I already have and the free space left and I realized that it will probably only fit 300 if you're lucky... All in all its a cute mp3 player, it doesnt have the greatest features though!"
3,Should've saved for an iPod mini :(,"I was very excited about ordering this mp3 player (even if it was refurbished). I was disappointed, maybe because of my anticipation? The downloading software didn't work for me on the first day, and it chooses to act up at random times. I didn't see why I couldn't just drag-and-drop mp3 files from folder to folder like I was so accustomed to. True, it does have a 695-song capacity, but if I had had the chance to do it again, I would've saved for an iPod mini--which is alot sleeker and less little-girl-play-toy looking. This is a nice mp3 player, though, and a nice one to have if you're not willing to spend alot of money (I got my refurbished one for $80). A nice little trinket for pre-teens, but not sophisticated enough for ""older young adults."" Also, it makes this annoying beeping sound (I don't know if I'm doing it wrong?) whenever I try to skip or play back a song. Is that normal?"
1,The Worst DAP,"I don't normally write these things, but this is a special case...I have 7,000+ MP3s. The bundled software - which MUST be used to transfer files to the player - took well over two hours to create a library. Even WMP can do it in less than 15 minutes. So far, so bad.Once I finally got a library created, I found that I could not use my MP3s without a time-consuming and glitchy conversion to what (I think) is a proprietary Sony format. This is crap.I returned this player and got a Samsung YP-T7J, which I am very pleased with. Drag-and-drop, no terrible (and boy do I mean TERRIBLE) bundled software supplied or required, and no compatibility surprises.Skip this one, people. It's REALLY bad."
2,great while it lasted...,"When i first got my bean, i loved it. Clear sound, unparallelled battery life... I gave it a 5-star review.However, both my bean and my sister's have since quit working without any apparent cause. My sister sent hers in for repair, and it came back good as new... only to quit working again a month later.I am not going to bother with getting my bean repaired...My advice: do what I am doing, and spring for the I-Pod Video."
3,Disappointed about the OLED screen,"I bought my Sony Bean 3 months ago, I thought that it was a very good MP3 Player, but now I can see that the screen of the Sony Company are soooooooo bad, I bought this MP3 player because it had 50 hours of playback, 1 GB, it had FM tunner, It was small and I liked the shape of it, also because I read many good reviews about this Sony Bean, but now the sceen looks very misty and the brightness of the scrren is very low. So if you are going to buy this Sony Bean or onother product Sony MP3 Player you will know this information, if it happens to me, it can happen to you or onother person........"
2,"good price / memory, bad construction","The price for a 1 gb MP3 player is very good, but I was disappointed in the construction of this Sony product. I recognize the Sony brand for quality, and was therefore disappointed at the flimsy construction of the operating switch. It was quite difficult to switch back and forth between the FM radio player and the MP3 player functions. Many times the switch ""slid"" betweem these functions. Meaning you are listing to the radio one minute and a digital song the next. Perhaps I had a uniquely misfunctioning product, but in general I would stay away from the Bean. I returned this product within one week of owning it."
1,SKIP IT,"This Bean should not be allowed to carry the legendary Sony Walkman title. This thing is awful! The proprietary software wont allow you to play the MP3 files on another computer, you can upload MP3s without using the software to transfer files, but the Bean wont let you play them. Also whoever signed off on the design should have their head checked, I dont mean the bean shape, I'm talking about the clasp/mode-selector/flappy thingy...its flimsy and breaks easily. When it gets bent outta place through normal use, it is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING to try to find the files, folders and to even switch it off! Forget it and save your beans for something else."
2,Somewhat ok.,"This Mp3 player is somewhat good when you first get it. However, it breaks very easily. Especially the cover of the USB cable. I returned my first one because the first time I got it, the cover feel right off. So I bought another one and it worked fine for a couple months and then the MP3 player has a formatting error and I don't know how to undo the format error."
5,Delightful,"Pagaing through this oversized coffee-table book is a delight.It contains over 800 pages with more than 1300 beautifully colored photographs supplemented with black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings.The book contains photos not only of furniture of three centuries of styles in several European countries, but also the interiors in which the furniture is placed. And the text material focuses on the aesthetic and stylistic aspects as well as the historical aspects.This enjoyable book is one of the best of its kind that I have seen, and I recommend it to all readers interested in interior decoration. It is well worth the price.The collaborating authors have done a truly fantastic job."
3,READ BEFORE YOU CHOOSE!!,"This is an LED ""brigt digi-tech brand"". IT is not very bright, and it cuts your hours by 1/3 if you dont have good batteries or a charge pack or a com1 autocharger. (they make these! buy it!) it is kind of unsturdy, and will break easily if dropped. Nintendo has a nother model (which is in the starter pack for the GBA) which is much more sturdy and gives an extra outlet. But this waistes even more energy! Whats kool: IT WORKS AND YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT AWAY! For beginners. Make your own if your older, its cheaper."
5,Is sharklight better than worm light???,"I think that the sharklight is alot better than the worm light only in the way that it is shaped. I have been thinking of buying a worm light but ever since I have seen this item I fell in love with it. Well, hope you feel the same way i do!!!!!!!!"
1,Not the best you could buy.,"While the SharkLight looks cool, it's definitely not the best there is. The SharkLight uses it's own batteries, which sounds like a good idea but really just gives you one more battery to change. You are better off saving your money and finding a good light source, like playing by a window or under a lamp. If you really must buy a light for your GameBoy/GameBoy Advance, I recommend the Nyko WormLight or WormLight Advance."
1,Piece of Trash,"At first I thought this light looked pretty cool, but then I received it and found out how cheaply manufactured it is. The batteries just add extra weight and the light just doesn't work like you would want it to. Definately not worth the money. Use a lamp."
2,An Okay Light...,"This light was helpful, and it could fit on a Game Boy Color or a Game Boy Advance, which was good. However, the design was annoying and you had to adjust it until you got the right angle. It was very irksome sometimes. You'd be better off getting some other light."
5,Sublimely beautiful - music to heal the soul,"I was lucky enough to find a copy of this CD recently, and I agree with every word of Mitch Bogan's comment - it is sublimely beautiful, soaring, spiritual, uplifting and healing music. It is a crying shame to see this exceptional CD out of print. I can't understand why Terry Callier isn't a household name on both sides of the Atlantic - with the voice and heart of an angel, he certainly deserves to be. If you like folk, jazz, soul - or any kind of beautiful music! - then I implore you to track down a copy of this CD, and spread the word. ""In brightest day or darkest night / Don't give up the faith / Keep your heart right... Keep your heart right."""
5,"Positive, Uplifting , Spiritual: A beautiful recording","I bought this cd without ever having heard any of Terry Callier's music. Word of mouth was enough for me to take a chance. This is easily the best contemporary music I have bought in many, many years. The disc starts with a powerful, yet peaceful track, and continues to mesmerize as the album continues. Some songs are more jazzy, some a bit more folky. We even have Pharoah on many songs! This is a must buy cd!"
4,Television is NOT mindless entertainment!,"I was assigned this book in a college course on television as popular culture. I seriously struggled with the text at first, but luckily I didn't sell it back. After rereading it again, it has completely smashed the myth that nothing on television is culturally viable. Do not fall into the trap of believing there is no culture left in America. This book will teach how to engage your television in a way that is as mentally stimulating as anything I can imagine. Do yourself a favor and get this book! It might take you a couple reads, but it's well worth it. Enjoy. (I took points off for density, but I have the 5th ed.)"
3,entertaining read,"Picked this book up in the bargain section and this sparked my interest. This book covers a range of topics and offers different possibilities of where different customs, traditions, etc come from. As interesting as this was to read, it offers no source of where the information comes from to help validate the claims being made. I got past this and kept reading because i am still curious about how things possibly could have came to be. So for a bargain price i thought it was a interesting book even despite its lack of evidence."
1,Don't buy this!!,"The other negative review just about sums it up. It is a collection of ""just so"" fables seemingly just made up by the author. On a few subjects where I actually knew what the provenance of something was, the book is erroneous. Please, please, please, don't waste your money as I did. Just a typical excerpt:""When....the tomb of Tullia, Cicero's daughter was discovered in the Via Appia outside Robe, it was said that a light had been burning inside for nearly 1,500 years. This was not necessarily an incredible, miraculous tale, but could have been accounted for by a supply of natural gas or oil.""This is NOT just an isolated case. The book is FULL of stuff like this."
4,Original vs Re-Recorded,"A good selection of song titles and artists, but be aware that most tracks are the singers' re-recorded versions. The oldest songs, from the '50s and early '60s, tend to be the versions that played on the radio; that's not the case with the others. Sometimes the differences are very slight, as in Roger Miller's ""King of the Road"". But ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"" is just awful. Personally, I enjoyed the live version of ""Delta Dawn"", but it doesn't sound at all like the original single. If it's important to you to have the original sound on these tracks, then skip this CD compilation. Otherwise, enjoy!"
2,Money better spent elsewhere...,"I have read about 10 real estate investment books within the last 6 months, and despite the Amazon.com user reviews, this book probably was the least informative, least well written, and least organized of the lot. The author refers to his real estate investment experience several times throughout the book, yet he discusses only the single property he has purchased, disqualifying him as a mentor in my mind. He write without technicality, and fills much of the book quoting other ""real estate gurus"" and citing summaries of text he has read. I am really surprised that this book was rates so highly on this site, because it really has been a disappointment and waste of time. By the way, some of the best books I have read have been written by Dolf De Roos. Best of luck to you all."
3,Nice Primer,"Cute, fun, great place to start for someone who is contemplating investing in rental housing. It was an easy read and an entertaining story about how one person got started. It wasn't a ""how to"" guide, however. I read it, loaned it to a friend, and haven't missed it. I have since purchased books that are more useful as reference material, if not as entertaining to read. If you're wondering if buying and rental properties is for you - this book is interesting. If you've decided to take the plunge and do it, you're going to need some more serious material."
2,"Entertaining story, lacks details and insights","This book basically tells the story of buying and renting a single family rental. It takes you through the day-to-day process of getting financing, finding a house, repairing it, marketing it, qualifing a tenant, getting paid. Basically it tells you what to expect, the ups and downs. The problem is that it seriously lacks in details and good insights. It reads like a beginner REI book written by a beginner. Another tip-off is the author keeps mentioning Carton Sheets (Mr. Get Rich Infomercial) and Robert Kiyosaki (author of the vapid ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" book series) two scam artist that give real estate investing a black eye. If you are looking for a great beginner investor book read ""Rental Houses for the Successful Small Investor""."
5,How to Succeed and Make Money with Your First Rental House,"Get this book today! When I bought this book I already had three houses. The information applies to the beginner and even has some important tips for those who are already on their way. The book is written by a real guy who is eager to share his trials and tribulations that we all have in this process. There are a ton of books out there on this subject but this one seems to relate more to the real person and what you can and should expect in the ""real world."" Plus, I have communicated with the author via email after I read the book and he is very accessible. It is nice to have someone in the business to bounce ideas off of who has been there!"
4,good for newbie investor,Wouldn't rate the book high for technical merit or depth of knowledge but as a new investor gives glimse of what is involved in rental property. Good job Doug
5,Deepest evil,"This is pure misanthropic black metal, born from Darkthrone and Mayhem and pushed to the new millenium. This has got to be the most evil and blackened and hatefull thing I have heard in a while, Craft really put themselves at the top of the black metal scene today. This black metal sounds like a combination of sludgey, Panzerfaust Darkthrone and also early bone chilling sounds like on A Blaze in the Northern Sky. This is the first Swedish black metal bands I have heard that doesn't sound anything like Marduk and that's a very good thing, because I was getting sick of that melodic Swedish sound.This is pure blackened evil and is suggested to all you dark souls."
5,All must hail Craft,"Craft, with a simple name, a simple album cover, and a simple mission, to destroy planet earth and all the whiney ass people that inhabit this pathetic planet! Great Black f$cking metal here!!! No wussy keyboards, no crappy female vokills for ""atmosphere"", this is real, raw, true torturous blackened metal! The name Total Soul Rape says it all! For that's exactly what this album does to you! I love blistering speed, but what i love about this band is the music is a lot slower, but it's not b/s ""groove-crap"", it's just...just buy this album along with there other 2!!! Great Metal from Sweden here!"
2,Simply Awful,"Satanic Doom Metal at it's worst. Theres no rythm to their songs on this crap,drums suck badly,guitaring is doodoo if you can hear it,quality is off and just easily put,it is an embarassment (musically) overall. I gave it 2 stars because I love the lyrics. I wish Misanthrope was a religion instead of a feeling. Might I recommend: Sargeist - Satanic Black Devotion. Even if you don't agree with my opinion,whatever. Just like everyone else,I'm judging the album by my taste and standards."
1,glare,"Put simply, does not allow you to see the screen very well. The light is not powerful enough and creates too much glare on the screen. Not worth buying."
1,Bad Mad Catz,"This light stinks...it is very dim and the magnifer stinks too. The magnifer is not the right distance from screen and it makes the screen appear rounded. Do not buy, I'm sorry I did...and the clear plastic packaging makes it implossible to try and returm it if you are not satisfied."
1,One word: bulky,"I think this item is way too bulky. I tried playing under one, but it was hard to see. THe magnifying glass did not do much to help except make it look really bad, and the lights on the item made a reflection. I suggest the one by pelican that is little and that folds over the screen when you are not using it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"now,i know you all think that its wonderful to magnify the game screen.well just lettin you know THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SCREEN IS DARK ENOUGH AND THIS WILL ONLY MAKE IT DARKER!!!!!!!.trust me you will be unbelievably dissapointed with this.just buy a real light.why do you think they made the thing so (...) cheap???!!!"
1,Do NOT buy this,...The light is so dim and doesnt even shine on the screen properly.Also the magnifier makes it worse....
4,Good one,Got this via regular mail in 3 days from the day i ordered. The installation was easy.The combo gives a flexibitlity to copy your old VHS tapes into DVD. Copied the VHS into DVD and went fine without any issues. Found out in a hardway that it needs only DVD-R and NOT DVD+ disc to burn. Have just started using it so will see how it goes.
4,Good but not perfect,"I've copied two VHSs of operas that I wanted to back up. Unfortunately the English subtitles have got lost in the process. Sadness since my German and Italian are minimal.No one has mentioned that it plays DVD-ROMs. If you copy a DVD in your PC using Nero Recode, some DVD-RW drives - like my two, a Philips and an LG - enable the book style of a DVD+R/RW (including DL) blanks to be changed to this. Very handy.Still a shame about those lost subtitles"
1,This is garbage and so is Samsung service response,"I put the firmware on this thing to fix the freeze problem. Now it does not work at all. The install died in the middle. I've tried to call Samsung, but after being on hold for several hours, I gave up. I've emailed service three times over two weeks, and have not gotten a response. I recently bought one of their LCD HDTVs, and I really like it. Sure hope it does not break because I don't think I could reach service to fix it. I WILL NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN!!!!!"
3,More bang for your buck ?,"I purchased the SAMSUNG DVD Recorder based on good experience with other SAMSUNG products. The price was the lowest available for a unit claiming to perform all the functions of a DVD/VHS recorder. I previously owned two JVC units that failed miserably. One before the 90 parts and labor warranty expired, and one after. That's the only reason I had two of the pieces of junk. The SAMSUNG unit has excellent written documention, is easy to set up, and worked like a champ out of the box. The third time I tried to record something on the DVD it started acting strange and wouldn't recoginize a disc. I called SAMSUNG's customer support and received excellent service (unlike JVC). They advised me to returne the unit to their facility in New Jersy for repair. I just got it back two days ago and the unit works great so far. For the money, you can't beat it and I know for a fact that it's a better unit that the JVC DR-MV1S at over $ 150 less."
1,DISSAPOINTED,"PLAYS FINE, BUT WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO COPY, COULD NOT GET ""COPY"" ON THE MENU GOT A MESSAGE THAT READS THIS FEATURE DOES NOT EXIST, IT IS A RECORDER AND HAS ALL THE FEATURES LISTED ON THE REMOTE."
1,DVD Player should play DVDs,"Bought this to copy some old tapes to DVD and it seemed to do ok at that although the interface is a bit clunky. However, it (like another Samsung DVD player I own from a couple years ago) won't play all comercial DVDs. I tested it with Matrix and it pixilated frequently during action scenes and hung up for several seconds at the layer change. Then it froze frequently until the end. Put the DVD in my old Hitachi player and no problems so it wasn't the DVD. I took it back and will try another I guess. Maybe the Toshiba."
3,Doesn't like to play commercial DVD's,"We have had this over 2 months now and it does great transfering VHS to DVD and recording onto DVD. It even plays DVD-R's great, but rentals-FORGET IT. Skips, pixels and stalls. Also gets wiggy reception through the antenna connection."
1,VCR doesn't work properly,"I bought this at the end of January and everything was fine at first. It was easy to operate and the quality of the recordings was good. After 2 1/2 months, however, the VCR developed a problem.If I set the timer, all I get is sound and a gray screen with flickers of the program I recorded. I get the same thing with my already recorded tapes. It appears to have a tracking problem. It went back to Samsung for repairs, but it still doesn't work properly. Only the 'automatic' recording feature wll produce a viewable tape, and I still can't watch any of my previously recorded.I purchased this unit so I could convert my tapes to DVD and feel as though I've wasted my money on this unit. It will go back to Samsung again tomorrow.The DVD portion works fine but if you want a VCR, too, buy something that works."
3,Lukewarm,This series did not engage my sensibilities enough to pay for the rest of the episodes. It was mediocre - not exciting enough or actually at all. If it went to Prime I would watch it but not worth any more dollars to view. Sorry. Loved the title.
3,"Intriguing, But Falls Short at End","I was very excited to watch this series from the BBC. With actors like Warren Brown and Steven Mackintosh, it promised to be quite good!I like the creative ways that the series goes back and forth between present and past, but at times it gets a bit confusing to maintain the correct order of events. What makes this series different from other heist movies is the look into the main characters' personal lives, and what influences their choices.While I won't give anything away as to whether the heist is or isn't successful, the ending falls flat, with a few loose ends not tidied up. In addition, since most of us viewers expect dramatic endings, the lack of such left me a bit deflated. When one invests that much time in watching a series to see it end on such a bland note is disappointing.Not my favorite BBC series, but I'd still recommend it. British TV manages to be so much more original and clever when it comes to scripts than American TV."
5,Thinking Pink in Minnesota,My daughter is a flamigo fanatic and loved the bag. She had received a shirt from this same store (bought by her grandmother) a couple years ago. They match. The bag arrived quickly even during the holiday season and even met our short deadline to take it for Christmas at Grandma's.The bag's square bottom sits nicely on the floor and the heavy cotton material helps it stand up a bit and will last forever. The flamingo images seem pretty robust also. Thanks.
4,Great Product,"I have another larger case for my Digital SLR camera, and bought this one for times when I do not have as much space, and only need to carry the camera with one lens. Great size, fits well into a backpack, and provides good protection."
4,"Kershaw Responder, after a year","I use this knife as a river guide and kayaker, and here is how she fares...The knife itself is amazing, I personally love the size, features, and design. Although it is considered hefty to some, it does not slip out of gloved hands, and is secured tightly within its sheath.However,The sheath DOES have a downside. The screws and screw holes will get rusted out, even with proper maintenance. I recently went on a 3-day ocean kayaking trip and the sheath did not make it through the third day, one securing screw completely stripped out, the other fell apart. The warranty is amazing of course, so I am looking forward to see if Kershaw provides a new sheath.Overall this knife replaced my old river knife, and did so in spades. I recommend it to anyone needing a blunt-tip bad@$$ knife."
4,Modern Day Jim Thompson,Ken Bruen's book is very reminiscent of the late great Jim Thompson in the descent into madness that the main character goes through and the characters that fill this novel with one major difference - Jim Thompson had the tendency to write passages of his books in a manner that was quite incomprehensible while Bruen writes quite masterfully.This novel involves a bouncer who meets a black girl and starts a torrid affair with her while dealing with his no good but amiable friend Dex. Together they plan the kidnapping of a businessman for ransom.The book is not long (about 145 pages) and reads quite briskly but it has some disquietening moments throughout and demonstrates quite clearly that Bruen is a writer to read.Recommended.
2,Mediocre noir.,"This is a rather weak example of noir writing. Bruen uses the short, choppy style, but his sentences seem empty of the toughness that characterizes the best noir (I'm thinking of Ellroy or Thompson). He also has some very annoying (and frequently used) stylistic devices which detract. Throw in some high and low culture references which aren't even necessary, weak characterizations, and an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusions, and you've got ""Rilke on Black""."
2,Ho-Hum,"Very short basic kidnapping story revolving around an aging bouncer type, a sexy young woman and their dodgy partner in crime. Of course since this is noir, they can't trust each other one bit as they run around South London and nasty things happen. Lots of sex and killing, pretty ho-hum stuff."
1,Know what you're getting,"If you are looking for books by Allison Lane the romance author then be warned that this is a completely different author as far as I can tell and a disappointing book. As there isn't much information on Amazon I'll give you the description from the back which gives a fairly accurate idea of the story line:""There are three prophecies leading to the day of judgment, two fulfilled in our lifetime. Now, American archeologist Breezy McKenna, drawn to the mysteries of Jerusalem's buried past, becomes an innocent pawn in a plot to unleash the final fury""There is a slight element of romance between the heroine and two men she has to contend with, the first is an Israeli Intelligence Officer and the second is a half Arab, half Christian who assists her. I can't recommend it as a book for romance lovers although fans of other genres may find it more interesting."
5,In Peril on the Sea,"You don't know how lucky you are to be able to simply order this book; I had to contact a bookseller in London to buy it when I was 16. This one completed my set of ""Swallows and Amazon"" books, and maybe that's why I love it so much. Live the adventure that starts as just a wonderful, if tame few days and nights on board a small sailing boat and turns into a struggle for survival, and a journey of growth, as each of the four children learns his or her own weaknesses and strengths. A children's book for all ages."
5,Sailing adventure in the 1930's,"This was the book that got me started on the Swallows and Amazon's series when I was around 8 or 9. My father had an old copy he was awarded as a school prize back when he was at Boarding School in the UK during WWII. I enjoyed it from the time I first read it, and have reread it many a time since. The Walker children inadvertantly sail across the North Sea in a snall yacht, after first being swept out to sea and then sailing through a storm. Covers a short time-span but a lot of realistic adventures.Some of the events in this book were based on real-life events that happened to Ransome himself and the yacht in the story, the Goblin, was based on a yacht that Arthur Ransome owned, all of which no doubt contributed to the realism of this book."
5,Spectacular Photography,"I don't know what impressed me more, the spectacular photography or the effortless and fascinating way Fred Ward helped me understand pearls. He takes the mystery out of buying pearls. I will not buy pearls again without reviewing this book."
3,"Pearls, dissapoints :-(",I was dissapointed in this book after reading it. I was looking more for a reference book on pearls and not a rambling history lesson. The history is important but not as much as the reference part I was looking for.
5,Great Album!,"This is what you want to hear. A solid album! Great gutair works, great music, great lyrics, JUST GREAT!5/5 Stars!"
1,absolute poop,"don't buy this disc, it belongs in the garbage next to the last three in flames and soilwork discs. bands, especially metal bands, should never sell their souls and vision to the corporate music machine, yeah you're probably sellin more records but all passion and vision is gone from the music. if you want bodom, get everything up through follow the reaper, hatecrew if you don't mind a little commercial, but then stop."
3,eh.,"it's okay. i'm glad i have it. but if i lost it, i wouldn't buy it again. i don't like the last track especially, but the rest of the CD is alright. i listen to it, but overall, not impressed."
3,Bland Bodom,"This is a good metal album, but sounds too much like the other run of the mill stuff out there. Where are all the great neo-classical riffs and solo's which made bodom great? This album does not stand up to Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper.If you are a hard core fan buy it, if not, buy some of their older stuff."
4,Great release,"I don't see what everyone is talking about. Children of Bodom is not selling out. There is shredding, keyboards, and hard pounding riffs all over this album! What do people want for crying out loud. I've been listening to COB since the release of Something Wild, and I honestly can't tell a big difference. Its still great, its COB, and its refreshing, not recycled. Anyone who wants to get into real metal, check out COB. While your at it, check out the entire Finnish metal scene."
1,Awful,"Uninspired riffing, half-@$$ed guitar solos, overbearing vocals that sound like Marilyn Manson, downright cheesy lyrics. Hell even the cover sucks.This is not the thrashy, dark, heavy or technical Bodom you had up to 2003. Do your ears a favor and buy Something Wild, Breeder. Reaper and Deathroll instead of this $ellout nu metal bulls hit.PS: Ignore all those 5 star reviews who say 'DiS iz BodOM BestAst CD BeTTa dan Folo Da Rippa'. They all are nu metal kiddies who have no balls to listen to the old stuff....RIP Children of Bodom..."
2,What the Hell Bodom?,"Wow, I can't describe how dissapointed I am with this album. Besides Octavarium this was the album I was looking forward to the most, but now I can put this up there as my biggest dissapointment of the year. These guys used to be so good, I mean, pop in Hatebreeder and you'll see what I mean. I read in several interviews that this album had heavy industrial influences. Well then where the hell are they. Plus with a band with such a huge fan base, you wouldn't put a thought or worry with what the production will be like, but Something Wild, they're very first release had better production than this. Alexi's voice is also somewhat in question, it's obvious that he is losing it, and it is extremley aparent that he has several studio effects to it. The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because the Jani Warmen still shines on it. If you are looking for a place to start with Bodom, do NOT start here."
2,This is not Children of Bodom!!!!,"Is hard to say this: this album is boring, uninspirational and their sound is like another mallcore band, is hard but is true. Please, make yourself a favor and stay away of this and try: Mors Principium Est, Kalmah, Norther and Skyfire for great melodic death metal with no complaints. You thank's me later!!!"
2,It hurts to listen to this.,"Holy balls this album is awful! Being a Bodom fan since Hatebreeder; I was warned this album sucks. I should have listened. I should have got the hint when the E.p. came out. I should have listened. Damn it! The medolic speed power metal style is virtually gone and is replaced by an up-tempoed nu-metal style with a hint of the melodic melodies we have all come to love from the boys in bodom. Oh well, another band to add on to the list of, ""they suck now."""
2,Ow.,"Weeks before this was released, a friend of mine downloaded a few songs off this album and sent them to me. After hearing the first single ""In Your Face"", I was expecting an album at the very least on par with Hatecrew Deathroll, but not near Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper. Those two albums are two of the best albums of all time. Now where this new effort fails is the overall song structure, lack of original sounding riffs, and the brakes that have been put on Alexi and Janne's soloing. After first hearing the begining to ""Bastards of Bodom"" I got a sick feeling in my stomach and instantly knew there might not ever be a return to the fantastic styles of albums past. Don't get me wrong, there are glimmers of hope. ""We're Not Gunna Fall"" and ""Trashed Lost, and Strungout"" are the shining stars of this album. That does not mean I am satisfied. Alexi needs to seriously reconsider the style of music that they are playing, because this is simply not the Bodom that I, and many hardcore fans love."
4,Typical fun book,"A small picture book that is sure to bring a smile to your face, Cats Do the Cutest Things has pictures of cats on one page and an appropriate quote on the opposite one. You will recognize the habits that make a cat a cat over and over again as you leaf through the pages. The pictures are well done and do an excellent job of capturing the true nature of cats. Cats Do the Cutest Things is a recommended diversion from life into the world of cats."
3,This was my fault,"I bought this CD thinking it was sermons by Dr. Stanley, and realized when I got it that it was music.....duh for me!! It's contemporary Christian music, and frankly, a little more up-beat than I thought would be offered by such a conservative Baptist preacher as Dr. Stanley. It's OK, but will not induce an attitude of prayer or meditation, imho.Good music if you simply want clean, pleasing sounds to play during your day."
2,"Worked fine for a while. Then, it ceased to turn on.","Everything worked fine for a while. I installed the software and transferred all of my music to the drive. It worked great for a few months. Then, the power light started to flicker. Soon after, it wouldn't even turn on. It was useless. I contacted the manufacturer. They sent a new power supply that didn't fix it. I tried everything. It wouldn't work on any PC, or plugged into any outlet. By this time the warranty was expired. I found out it costs $1700.00 to recover the data! I took it apart, and put the harddrive in a harddrive enclosure. Thank goodness I have not lost my data. This external drive was a nightmare! Seems like its made to stop working right when the warranty runs out."
1,Died after only 9 months,"I've bought this hard drive in January 2007. It worked OK until September 07, when it just died. It was not on most of the time, I've switched it on for few minutes once every few weeks when I had new digital photos, so overall it probably did not work more than a couple of hours."
4,Why?,"Honestly...I really have no hardcore complaints about my Maxtor 300 GB drive..... I don't know why all y'all are having problems but mine's been working great for about 2 years now and I have absolutely no complaints. I trust it with all of my media files and backup files. I even have my own portable OS running from it when i travel.My only complaints are that it's not very portable with all the bulky cords and the LEDs are a little annoying (living in a dorm room so the blinking is in my room, not the office)I shouldn't really have to travel with it and i just covered up the LEDs with post-its. No issues after that!"
1,What a piece of crap,"Not only does my drive not work (after one big whopping use), but their tech support is worthless. I have NEVER felt so rushed off the phone. I plan on staying away from this company from now on."
3,duct is hard to extend,"These ducts are a value item and not a high quality product. I purchased 9 lengths to install 2 bathroom fans. I needed the full length of each duct. At least 5 of the 9 ducts came apart when I was extending them. The process I followed was to start in the middle of the duct and pull gently in opposite directions. Then, continue working one side of the duct to fully extend it before moving to the opposite side. If you pull too far (very hard to tell in advance), you will tear the duct. I compared this a spare piece of 4"" duct I had left from another project and that piece took a great deal more abuse before tearing.For the price, this was a good value but I probably should have gone up a level in quality had I know the problem I was going to have."
3,pickle things you never see--such fun to read and reread,Pickle up Pickle down--juggled by a Pickle Clown. Pickle things you never see--like pickles on a Christmas Tree my 2 kids loved hearing this book read to them and then reading it themselves--we would laugh and talk about how silly the Pickle Things were and even as they got older they liked to get it out to review and laugh again i want to get copies to give to friends of mine with young children who would enjoy this book
4,gideon's fire,"among the many crimes that were concerning george gideon, commander of the criminal investigation department at new scotland yard, there were two that troubled him most. its a fine, fast, exciting book--full of suspense"
1,A non-book,"I'm flabbergasted to learn that some readers actually enjoyed this pointless bit of piffle. Truly, there's no accounting for tastes. Here's the deal: this Ian Grey guy was briefly, peripherally involved in screenwriting. He's been in the same room with a few third-tier celebrities. He doesn't like think very highly of the movie business. Oddly, Grey seems to believe that this all adds up to some sort of sensational now-it-can-be-told muckraking extravaganza. It's a bit like a meter maid writing a tell-all account of the inner workings of the justice system. How these aimless drivelings ever found a publisher is a complete mystery. If you feel like rolling around in some real insider sleaze, read Charles Fleming's ""High Concept""."
5,easy to use and durable,Besides ordering a new battery on the internet every 3 or 4 years there's not much else to worry about.
5,You MUST Get This CD! There's nothing better than this.,Oh Ella! I wish I could tell her how much I have enjoyed this CD. She is the stuff dreams are made of. That voice! How did you do it Ella? So effortless for you. Incredible. This is my all time favorite CD. I listen to all kinds of music and cannot go a day without hearing Ella sing Cole Porter. Don't hesitate to buy this- you'll listen to it the rest of your life. Cole Porter's lyrics pour out of her so perfectly. Those songs were made for her to sing! Her phrasing is impeccable. I just cannot express how amazing this Songbook is. BUY IT!
5,The Perfect Combination,Ella is the best jazz singer ever and Cole Porter was certainly one of the best composers of his time. This is an amazing CD. Any jazz lover will adore it.
3,damn near perfect,"I have the original L P ..ella is not among my top ten female singers ..but this album or at least the parts of it I know, is as good an example of her singing That I know of,I guess I've been listening to it for 30 years..it still gives great satisfaction..williet"
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"This album is like a dream come true. The combination of Ella Fitzgerald's voice, clear, true and haunting with Cole Porter's complex, enchanting lyrics is truly incomparable. It has become one of my favorites."
5,excellent,"If you are looking for a definitive book on the history of British Railway Companies, this is it, but watch out for errors. Hunt it down. Don't go for Awdry's Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, it's not worth the bother."
3,"Cheaply made, but does an adequate job","The letters were all significantly tarnished out of the box. In addition, the fake candles blink very dimly to the point that you won't notice that they're on at all unless all of the lights in your room are off (and yes I used 8 brand new AAA batteries, which are not included).However, the letters are heavy enough to hold a fully loaded stocking hanging from their hooks, and look decent enough from a distance even with the candles turned off."
3,NOT THE BEST QUALITY,"The brass on all of the holders was tarnished, and the letter O was already almost falling out at the base. I still used it for this season just because I needed something to hang stockings on and did not have time to order something else, and from standing away looking at the mantle no one would have noticed. If you look closely though-you can see the lack of quality. They were not too expensive though for a 4 piece set so if I use them a couple Christmas seasons, it's worth it!"
1,Incredibly disappointing experience,The package arrived with a dayglow sticker saying it must be returned within 72 hours No Exceptions! The amazon paperwork said no returns accepted after Dec. 1st. I ordered this and the set of 2 candle mantle hooks on Dec. 4th. I wish I had known the Dec. 1st deadline before I placed my order because now I'm stuck with 6 pieces of very tarnished brass with gross impecfections. One of the pieces looks like they left extra solder splayed across it's front. It can be seen from 30 feet away. Also the bulbs are not standard bulbs. They have an extra plastic piece on the bottom used to screw them into the candle base. This means when the bulb burns out it can't be replaced with a store bought bulb. I'll never buy from Christmas Central again.
1,Yikes,"Let's just put it this way. If you want to hear Kittie but don't want to buy the album, just start beating a small child with a very large, injured cat. You'll get the same exact sound, MAYBE EVEN BETTER! AND IT'S FREE! :D :D :D"
2,girl metal?,"yesterday i bought a kittie cd because we had to just run up and down best buy and put your finger on a cd, and what you get is what you get. i only have 2 girl cds(destinyschild,jessica simpson)so i thought that they would be hiphop or r&b.so i went home and and listened to ""charlotte"".i couldnt believe it. it was girl metal. metal is for boy bands like korn and limp bizkit. keep the receipt if you buy this cd.i gave this cd to my sister because i didnt like how depressing their music was. there was too much screaming. these people are like dope, accept they are girls. if you dont like dope, then you will hate this cd."
1,"Please, leave Metal to talented people.....","""Spit"" by Kittie is one of the 2nd worst album of our generation (1st place is ""Wishmaster"" by Nightwish.) Please, leave Metal to TALENTED bands like Mudvayne and System of a Down. We don't need this crap invading the metal world!"
4,This Kittie's Got Claws!,"The four gothed-out ckicks from Canada,Kittie,rock harder and with more conviction than most of thier bloated male peers on thier ferocious debut,""Spit"".Kicking of with the feral title track,the album is a churning,abrasive nightmare of grinding buzzsaw guitars and lead vocalist Morgan Lander's ""Exorcist"" inspired ranting.Given the fact that the group's average age was around eighteen when they recorded it,thier performances on ""Spit"" show an amazing power and dexterity,anchored by Mercedes lander's rock-solid drumming.The album's highlite for me is ""Charlotte"",with an odd,angular melody and a sound that suggests a miraculous combination of Thurston Moore,Courtney love,and Korn's rhythm section,as well as ""Choke"", a huge,sputtering monstrosity that makes most other ""heavy"" music out there nowadays sound positively Britney-esque in comparison.Definately a welcome addition to any hard music fan's collection(and I'm not just saying that 'cause I've got a crush on Mercedes!!!!)"
5,This stuff is phat,"I can't believe these are chicks, The music is hot the chicks are hot and this is probaly some of the best metal since Slayer. I encourage anyone and everyone to buy this album now!"
4,Slipknot with PMS,"We can only hope that these girls' parents keep grounding them so we can get the outpouring of anger that kittie delivers in ""Spit."" They display a talent not often found in the ""high-school goth-chicks"" that dare their parents to ask them to wear that nice sweater that Grandma knitted them for Christmas. At the same time, their teenage rebellion is handled with a maturity and refinement. Highlights of their talent: Brackish and Paperdoll. And those boots! Check out the video that comes on this enhanced CD. There's more to these girls than I even allotted them credit for."
3,Okay,"Theres only one track(Brackish) that is good. the rest of the songs are okay. One of the worst tracks is Spit, it has a good opening guitar riff but then the instruments get really soft and then the vocalist starts screaming, I've heard this before and it doesn't sound bad, but with this song it sounded terrible.The album is pretty heavy but I wouldn't recommend it because it just doesn't sound good, except Brackish and maybe Charlotte."
3,Has Potential,"The concept of Kittie is great.....four young, hip chicks who can ROCK. And they are talented too. Some of their songs, like Brackish, show that they have real potential. However, sometimes I felt that Kittie slipped into metal cliches....yelling when there was no need to yell, swearing just to swear.These women have something to say, and they have the talent to say it. I look forward to their next album, since I am hoping that as they mature, so will their sound."
3,Have longer songs.,"I love the band, but I wish the songs were a lot longer. The only song on the album that clocks over 4 min. is ""Choke."" All the others barely make it past 3. I love the vocals from Morgan Lander. Weak vocal she's not. This music was meant to be played loud. Very loud. I love ""Spit,"" ""Charlotte,"" & ""Do you think I'm a Whore?"" These young ladies are going places."
1,bleh,"this is the worst cd ever made. all the singer does is scream curse words and other unintelligable (stuff). every song sounds exactly the same. these girls are NOT talented. they're only 'famous' cause they're chicks playing loud screaming music. they won't be around for much longer. i guarantee you that. if you want a good 'girl metal' band, check out drain STH. they've got more talent then kittie will ever have."
4,Kittie is a great sounding hard rock girl band,"kittie is great. it's really hard to come across a really good, heavy ALL girl band. I can hear alot of similarities between them and Garbage in some songs... such as Brackish. But in others songs they truly have their own sound."
1,kittie falls short,"absolutely horrid album. repetative, simple, unoriginal. pseudo metal for the same people who buy into marilyn manson and slipknot. do yourself a favor and buy some tool instead."
1,boooring,"this is just not interesting at all. i mean, i dig their message, the whole smashing sexism thing is cool, but musically, they just aren't there. there are so many girl bands that do this whole thing better. Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Kill The Man Who Questions, Cradle of Filth, Thorr's Hammer, Sonic Youth, etc... i'd suggest to anybody whose mind was blown by this album to check out those bands."
2,Very disappointing,"I listened to the single on the radio and thought this band would introduce a fresh twist to hard rock. Unfortunately, ""Brackish"" is the only good song on the CD. The rest are frantic, repetitive, and uninspiring. I felt like I was hearing the same song over and over, with a slight change in the arrangement. I wanted to like this band from the start, but they couldn't hold me. They are a garage band with promise, but not ready for the big leagues. Save your money and see if they improve on their next offering."
4,Chick Rock,"I am not a hardcore music fan. I can't compare this group to the blah blah blah, or the blah blah balm, but I love pissed off heavy metal, and this is that. I have had musics by this group for two decades and I continue to like it more and more. Take it for what it is, and this is an incredible album. Hard rock by properly pissed off people and I love it."
4,good,This is my first Kittie album.These women are a very good at heavy metal music.Their alot better than I expected.
5,heavier than hell,"This cd is HEAVY! The first song Spit is amongst the most brutal sounding songs of all time. THis cd is full of incredible drumming, and guitar riffing, and some beautiful singing parts. Pretty damn good for a bunch of girls still in high school. If your into really heavy stuff like Slipknot, Machine Head, Skinlab, etc, you must buy this cd, although Kittie is heavier than those bands."
1,I'm glad i don't own this CD...,"When I first heard of Kittie, I though ""cool, a girl heavy-metal band."" What I got was a bunch of whiny screaming .... .... Give me a break!"
4,Kittie Rock,The first full length album from kittie certainly didn't dissapoint with stand out tracks such as brackish and Raven it certainly impressed me. In my opinion they left the path open for bands like Otep and Sugarcoma in rock music. The follow up Oracle is even better i would recommend both these albums highly.
1,"UnOriginal,Overdone,Strained Larynx","My first thought was to give these girls a chance to be great. Sadly, it just made me laugh and worry about the condition of their throats when they actually become legal. I see that a lot of you really liked it but I found the SAME guitar riffs in every song and a lack of original material. Sorry, but it stinks like old KITTY LITTER."
1,Kittie is absolutely no talent trash. TERRIBLE!,It is obvious that Kittie is terrible. Every single song is a monotonous gothic feminist moaning session. It takes no talent to bury yourself in grey and black makeup or scream louder and longer than james Brown or Steven Tyler. I am pissed off with Kittie's obsession with the terrible male gender. The music frankly sucks. It is not fun to listen to. Terrible band.
1,riot grrrl retro,"Already we have 90s retro. How sad. So cliche it's sad. If they weren't chicks under 21, you'd never have heard of them."
1,Suck + Choke + Spit = Bad CD,"I pity these suckers who bought the hype, all they are is four bisexual (I may be guessing) wanna-be punk rock/metal chicks who cannot belt out even a low quality song. But I didn't buy it, what led me to the conclusion was that I seen the ""Charlotte"" music video on this channel called ""The Box"", I guess it's only on a few channels in the U.S. (it plays music videos 24/7 that you can pick) and did a little listening to the samples on this site and really didn't care for it, even though I had no thought of buying it anyhow. Plus who made up the song names anyways? Doesn't Suck, Choke, and Spit sound a little like someone who has choked on something and someone is giving him the hymlick (can't spell it but you know what I'm saying!) maneuver. Every song sounds the same, or atleast ends up to be. Scream a word here, scream another word there. If you want a good song with excellent lyrics, buy 'N Sync's ""God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You"" single. That's it!"
5,Spit,I saw them in concert with Slipknot and they were GREAT! This CD is the First on my list of CD's. They're the best since...well since whatever got me listening to rock. I can't wait till they come back to Miami for another concert. I will definitly be there.
4,rating madman,very heavy and very loud. i think kittie will go a long way. i think i see them opening up for bands like pantera and maybe metallica in the near future and who knows well in my opinion i see stardom and i think sometime in the near future they will be headlining their own shows
5,spit[ecd],this album was great there arent many all girl bands that can actually sound that great i give it five stars 1 for great female vocals 2 for a very well put together album 3 for a great sound 4 for great guitars and 5 for great looking girls.
3,"Kittie purrs, they don't roar.","I bought this CD for one song (spit), and after giving the album a few good listens, I decided that I liked the band. Hard Core chicks are a weakness of mine and they struck a big fat chord with me. The only problem I had at all with the cd is that there are subtle hints that Kittie will not be continuing down the hard core road that this album landed on. The four young female combination is TOO marketable and in the humble opinion of this listener, I see a slow but inevitable softening of the music we'll get from Kittie."
1,Good band but- This is NOT an audio CD!!,I find the band interesting but this is not an audio CD so it is of little use to me. Hopefully they will re-release it in a standard format. So I guess it gets returned.
1,Crap.,"... I expected to like Kittie when a friend of mine gave this to me. I thought, ""Cool, a girl band on the metal scene."" This is one of the worst albums I have in my collection. My listening tastes vary from Hanoi Rocks to Sepultura, so I'm usually pretty open to new stuff, but I didn't like this. In reponse to the riot grrl comments, that's what it sounds like: whiny teen girls from the north who have nothing to complain about but do it anyway to get airplay.In Metal Edge they're supposedly one of the best bands out there- if that's true, us metalheads have a lot to fear."
2,All hype and little quality.,"I feel bad lancing into a group of enthusiastic teenage rockers -- and my compatriots to boot -- but Spit is a pale excuse for a rock record.The guitars are thin and mixed low, more of a groan than a growl, lacking in both punch and diversity, a sludgy mess of sounds. The vocals are an unsophisticated grind, the lyrics barely discernible. There isn't much songcraft on display here, and even the excitement level is severely limited due to too much attention to a rumbling low end and not enough biting treble.Some points for attitude but that's about it. For good hard rock/metal by women, go for Veruca Salt's Eight Arms to Hold You, Drain S.T.H.'s Horror Wrestling or Phantom Blue's Built for Performance."
1,Awful!,"1.)A girl trying to scream and sound like a guy at the same time is an awful sound!2.) Every song ( exept 2 ) is 2:30 minutes or less! And thats only because of the looooong pauses in the middle3.) Music? More like noise4.) The same guitar riffs repeated through every song!Totally unoriginal!5.) If they were 30 years old and ugly, you would have never heard of them. NEVER!6.) Dont expect to see a 3rd album from this band.7.) They need to go back to grammer school, because every other lyric is a curse word."
1,Unbearably BORING,"Kittie is the single most boring, untalented, and contrived band in the history of mankind. It sounds like these poseurs were manufactured at the MTV nu-metal factory, complete with whiny lyrics, down-tuned guitars, and a very commercial, plastic overall feel. Don't let all the hype fool you, this band truly lacks any musical ingenuity and no one will even remember them next year (as with all fads). If you kiddies want some serious metal check out early Sepultura or Suffocation."
1,kittie,I've heard good things about kittie so i decided to check them out...figuring they would be as good as i've heard. im sorry to say that they are terrible. the lead singer has no focus on music and the lyrics are meaningless repeats. they don't seem to know what they're doing. don't waste your money.
1,Should let us give 0 stars.,"This is the worst album ever... Do not buy this album! For starters, they're only popular coz they're [female]... yet all they sing about is sexism, feminism and how bad they've had things. They could barely play their instruments when I saw them live ... The drums are marginally better than everything else, but considering that everything else is boring, simple and sloppy I don't think that's too much to be proud of. THE most overhyped piece... ever. They may enjoy the success they have which they've earnt so far, simply from being good-looking girls ... Quite frankly, a pile of rubbish.P.S. to say this is catchy, original or has excellent lyrics is a joke."
1,Let down,"Like so many others, I heard great reviews and decided to check them out.And like some others I was left with a piece of plastic that would have been better use to me as a frisbee than a music CD.I think that they are getting popular on the fact that they're teenagers, girls, and a heavy metal band. But thats my opinon and I know some people agree with me. (I know several)"
1,Brackish=Rubish.,"Yes yes, about a couple months ago I gave this cd a 5 star review-but I hadn't heard ANYTHING by them at the moment and was thinking with my you know what. This is just plain trash. It puts good female fronted bands like Skunk Anansie, Drain S.T.H, Tura Satana and Human Waste Project to shame. All they do is scream and the guitars are never in tune and the lead singer only sounds pathetic when she yells. NO I am not sexist. I love a chick just as much as the next guy, I'm just saying that those above bands could be a better investment in your cd collection."
1,Not worth the money,"Overall, too satanic and Marilyn Manson-like for my tastes. And I prefer Metallica. But, Brackish is an excellent song and I bought the CD with the hope of the rest of the songs being the same way. In my opinion, [geta copy of] Brackish and try to forget the rest of the album."
3,I like there other albums better...,"I first heard of the band Kittie after they made their third cd ""until the end"" because they werent played on the radio or anything where I lived. So after listen to the cd ""until the end"" I loved the band quickly. Then I went to buy their other two albums. They only had the ""spit"" cd. So I bought it and listened to it at home. You can tell they are much younger in this album. They tend to have no idea where to put some screaming into certain areas of a song. The song ""Johnny"" I can't stand at all. But I wasn't to impressed with this album. I recamend ""Until the end"" a lot more."
3,it's alright,"This cd is not the most musical innovative cd. It's got its good songs but most of the cd sounds alike. Not to mention that the lyrics aren't very great. Lyrics like Jonny's been a really bad boy or Do you think I'm a whore really don't catch any meaning for me. The drumming is nothing amazing. Pretty basic nu metal stuff.What I find the most interesting is the bass. I enjoyed the bass; it added texture to the very basic guitar. Now with that said I would give it a 1 or maybe a 2 but I found the vocals to be different and it helped me to enjoy the cd a little more. Your not going to find many female vocalists in rock (this being nu-metal) noneless a full female band. Morgans voice is pretty good unlike the lyrics. Favorite songs - Trippin, Suck, and Immortal."
3,Nah,"This CD is okay but not the greatest. I had to get used to the singer because she sounds different. But I think she has no talent and the guitarists don't know what they are doing. The only song I like is Paperdoll. The other songs are mostly below average but some of them are average. That's why this CD is 3 stars. Overall, not worth your money. For 14 bucks, no, definatly no. But if you are trading a CD and a friend offers you this, I guess you could trade something for it. Just be prepared to expect something diferent, way different!"
3,"Kittie Rocks, but they aren't the first!","Though the Kittie record may strike one of three chords with the angst-ridden teens of today, their sound owes much to other ANGRY poultry (chick) bands of the past notably the influential Runaways, who must always be mentioned--like it or not-- or more recently ERIKA KANE, the rage-driven co-ed jailbait power trio whose base behavior and nihlistic message rocked the Sunset Strip and numerous desert raves in the early nineties before their self-destruction. Notably ""Do You Think I'm A Whore"" which contains much of the same energy as ""Soultry Poultry, Hot Chicken"". Kittie rock, but they ought to give credit where credit is due."
2,Unispiring,"Everywhere I went I kept hearing about this great all girl heavy metal band that was getting great reviews from everyone. Never hearing them before I decided to check out the cd and decide for myself. I was unimpressed. After you get past the fact that they are all girls and all really young, the music is just plain boring. Sure it's heavy with your typical screams, angst ridden lyrics laced with cuss words, mosh pit riffs and such but most of the songs sound the same and just don't seem to have any originality to them. I have to admit that I do like the song ""Brackish"" which is very good but also the only one that I can seem to remember from the cd. Not to mention that the cd is only like 35 minutes long or something it's not worth it to buy a cd for one song. If you want to check out a really good all girl heavy metal band then check out Drain."
4,"A good,heavy cd","I'm not sure of some of the negativity surrounding this album.Many say that it's only growling.Yet they claim to like heavy music.Hmm.Kid Rock is not heavy,nor is Crazy Town.This is a very heavy album, similar to Slipknot and Soulfly.Actually,Kittie is among the heaviest I've heard (older Fear Factory is heavier though)These girls can certainly play.And Morgan can sing quite good,regardless of the screaming.So if you enjoy the previously mentioned bands, you'll enjoy this."
2,Three good stories,"I bought this book because it has 3 words on it ""Orson Scott Card"". However I found that most of the stories reminded me of books I read in the 7th grade. Three of the stories had good content and were enjoyable reading. However ...this book is highly over priced and should sell for about half that price. For the most part if these were the winners that made it into this book I don't want to see the losers. When I pay [this much] for a paperback every story in it better be a jewel."
1,Worst Game Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,the cover made the game look intresting but it was anything but. I was really disappointed when I discovered it was just a point and click type game with no direct control over the characters. the graphics were mediocre as well as the storyline. This is definatly not something you want to waste your money on.
1,This game is SO BAD!,"This game can be described in one word: CRUD. Its a total WASTE of good graphics. The storyline is bad. The game play is bad. You have no direct control of ANY characters. Some characters are little kids with NO fighting skill and if they get caught they die in like, 2 seconds.And in everything else: the game is STILL BAD! The game is not worth a buy, its not even worth the 1 star that I gave it but thats the lowest I could rate it...."
4,It's about time!!,I have been waiting YEARS for this to come out! This is a great movie about college friends who get together about 10 years later and reminisce about their years in school and the time in between.
5,VHS is not enough,"I love this movie, it's one of my comfort films. Sadly, my vhs copy is wearing out. It needs to be available on DVD! And extra's would be really nice too.I was really pleased to see all the good reviews, no one I know had ever heard of this movie before I mentioned it."
4,Huge Lauri as you've pribably never seen him,"Rita is a great writer and this situation ""comedy"" has its lighter moments, but it's really a heavier topic for most of the characters' lives. It's also great to see Rita in a role as compared to her stand up comedy routines. The biggest surprise of all was seeing Huge Laurie and Stephen Fry in different roles from their Jeeves and Wooster characters, and of course, House."
3,So close to being a good film,"This film is so close to being wonderful--the cast is incredible, the story is great, and the locations are super. But, things just don't hang together in tone or content to make it truly touching or truly funny. Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton deliver wonderful and touching performances and that in itself is worth the price of the DVD. But, the Kenneth Branagh - Rita Rudner characters are the backbone of the piece and that relationship never becomes understandable. Plus, the tone moves from slapstick to serious without any real connective pieces. Okay, I will probably watch it again and maybe even again--I mean just watching the Cambridge Footlights crew together is a pleasure (and Stephen Fry always makes me smile). This film is often compared to ""The Big Chill"" but it doesn't deliver the same impact."
2,Just a rehash,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. Unfortunately it is just a rehash of ""The Big Chill"" and I don't mean vaguely the same. I mean total rip off. I also sensed that these fine actors were working really hard trying to make something of it, but couldn't. Really too bad."
1,A vision of hell...,"Branagh creates a creepy world of horror in this little film. Imagine being surrounded by one-dimensional ""characters"" who trot out their crisis motivations at precise intervals. Then wallpaper it all with your favorite tunes of the 80s and pretend this serves as ""continuity."" Then come up with a final revelation that is stunning in its predictablity. They claim it all only takes place on a weekend, when it really feels like eternity. ""The Big Chill"" was only a toe dipped in the pool of smug self-importance--now take the dive.The worst part is that everyone involved here has done very good work elsewhere. Somehow, I think Ed Wood got channelled into the bargain."
3,"Pretty good brit version of ""Big Chill"" without the suicide","Being a big fan of Mr. Laurie, I've been getting everything that he has been in...(have ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"" sketch comedies so wanted to continue watching S Fry and him act together)as well as K Branaugh. Pretty good story line with good interplay of characters (clever way of showing time passing) but glad I saw it at home and not in theater. Feel good friend movie."
2,British Big Chill,"This movie was entertaining, but I must admit I wanted to see it because Tony Slattery was in it. His acting really surprised me because I always thought of him a clown, but I can now see that he is capable of a strong performance. I enjoyed this movie."
2,"Derivative, Forced and a Prison for Talented Actors","This is one of those films that I'm willing to watch, at least in segments, in order to appreciate some very good actors as they make the best a cliched, poorly-written script. As others have noted, this is really just a Transatlantic imitation of The Big Chill. I don't like that film much, either, and so I'm of course not going to be crazy about watching an imitator. There are some clever lines, I will admit, but each character has become mired in his or her personal rut since the group last reunited, and each rut is stated and restated and analyzed in about every facile and melodramatic manner one could imagine. Still, there's a lot of talent on that screen, and while I cringe at the script I can admire the actors' attempts to salvage it. At some point, however, there will come a point where I won't be able to watch even a few minutes of this disappointing film anymore, and I suspect that point will arrive early next year."
4,Great for 2 yr olds.,This is a great game for very young kids who are just learning shapes and colors. It is not a game that you will ever play again after the kids are 4-5 but it was the first board game they learned to play.
1,Not worth your money...,"Don't bother with this game! I'm a pre-school teacher who bought this game for my class of 3-5 yr. olds as we are doing ""A Very Hungry Caterpillar"" unit. While I understand what the game creator was trying to cover (number recognition and counting, one-to-one correspondence, matching, the butterfly life cycle), the game itself is poorly thought out. Way too much stopping and waiting (it can take forever to spin a moon...) which makes the game boring and frustrating for kids. In addition, the caterpillar playing pieces are small cardboard boxes, which easily rip when inserting the tabs in place to make them. I had to tape two of the playing pieces before one game was even played! Not worth your money..."
2,blow by blow is still boring,"I tried to get through this novel twice. My Uncle gave it to me after buying it in Ireland. I couldn't even get past the ""War And Peace"" style writing and eventually had to give up. I never did find out about my family."
2,Is this for real?,I'd like to hear an Irish person's take on this book. It reads like a cross between magical realism and a pulp historical novel. I was hoping for a more grounded account of Ireland in the 19th century.
4,Cheesy show but fun!,"I like this show - it's nothing ground breaking, but it's easy and fun to watch, even if it is quite cheesy! :)My only real problem is that the episodes spread over the 4 DVDs are out of sequence, which mixes the long run stories up. It would have made more sense for the shows to be in broadcast sequence."
4,a fan,"I grew up watching the olsen twins, this show is so cute and funny. If your a fan of MaryKate and Ashley then you'll probably like this show :)"
4,subtitles,"please, someone can tell me if the so little time box have spanish subtitles? have teh DVD extras,as a bloppers? because full house havent got bloppers..... what a pity"
