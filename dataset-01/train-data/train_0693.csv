3,Out of ideas?,"The last two Barbie movies, A Fashion Fairy Tale and A Fairy Secret, are showing that Barbie must be out of ideas. Their mining the Fairy angle until it's dry. The next Barbie Movie, coming out in fall 2011, also involves Fairies. My 6 six year old daughter enjoyed A Fairy Secret, but the accents in A Fashion Fairytale wore too bad for even her. Barbie should go back to the musical format that my whole family enjoyed."
1,not recieved,this product has not been received yet...i gave it 1 star only because i had to give at least 1
3,Not as good as previous movies...,"We have and love all the Barbie Movies, but this one was not as good as the others. Not as ""magical"". Ken is funny with some good lines. My daughter didn't like the ending. Overall it teaches good things about friendship and misunderstanding etc...but, well, these ""modern"" one's just don't capture my daughter like the old world or fairy world movies did. I recommend seeing it, but just don't expect it to be as good as what we're used to with Barbie."
2,Not the best,"Some Barbie movies are fun and even I enjoy watching them with my 5 yr old daughter (Swan Lake, Nutcracker, Three Muskateers), but this one was not fun to watch. I don't like the new trend in Barbie movies that focus on boyfriend/girlfriend issues and pure vanity (examples Barbie Diaries and Barbie Fashion Fairytales). I like the old ones that had good music and a more innocent vibe to them. These newer movies have tween subjects but we all know the majority of viewers fall in the 4 - 6 yr old age range, so please keep them innocent and fun!"
2,Not the great Barbie movie format of the past,"I love Barbie movies, and so does my 5yo daughter. Most all of the movies have had very positive themes of friendship or honesty and I have felt this was a positive message for girls. However, it seems the Barbie movies are moving away from good themes and more toward entertainment value. There is still a message, it is just harder to find. The last movie, Fashion Fairy Tale and this movie Fairy Secret have been true disappointments. Additionally, the animation, voices, and overall quality have not been quite the same. My daughter does like both of these movies, however we have to sit down and discuss what the message is as it is just not apparent. I am disheartened to say that I will not be purchasing any more of the Barbie movies unless I read reviews that they are stellar!"
3,Meant for the older kids,"We own most of the barbie movies and this one is by far the worst. My daughter normally sits and watches these movies and loves singing along with the songs. This one, she kept asking us if it was almost over. Also, she has not asked to watch it again and we have had it since the day it came out, which is very unusual for her. The other ones she still asks for daily."
1,Really NOT for little girls,"Just picked this up last night, and really wishing I had read the reviews first!! It is not appropriate for a 4 year old, as the dolls are acting like bratty teans, rolling of the eyes, and cat-fights. Liked the dancing princess movie and others, but I can't think of any age this is appropriate for. Makes me want to stay away from any more Barbie movies."
5,My Daughter loved it!!!!,"My Daughter wanted this so bad so I decided it would be from the ""Easter Bunny"" and she was so excited to see it in her basket! It was packaged nicely and arrived right on time! :) Definitely would order again!"
1,"This Barbie movie will be conveniently getting ""lost""","We have four other barbie movies that I am quite happy with (both Mermaid Tales, The Princess and the Pop Star, and Princess Charm School). All of those revolve around personal responsibility and friendship - this one almost completely revolves around boys, which I find completely inappropriate. I bought this movie assuming it would be similar to our others and it's not the case - the girls are all brats, only care about clothes and being better than one another, and the whole plot is about girls fighting over a boy. Completely absurd for the target audience. I'm waiting for a few days until my daughter is over the excitement of receiving a new movie, and then it'll be going into the trash."
1,I didn't want streaming,"I wanted a DVD for grandchild, when I found out it was not DVD, I couldn't get rid of it."
1,Complete Mistake,Do not like it nor does my 5 year old care for it. My wifes kindle was on one touch buying. It was accidently purchased or purposely by 5 year old.
5,Great,"barbie a fairy secret was a really great movie, I loved the parts with princess Garciella and Ken, was hillarious. I like the relationship barbie and raquelle build as new friends. very great movie."
2,Did not last long =(,I used this l.e.d scanner with my car alarm and it last only 2 weeks! It burned out fast!
2,This is not a how-to book ...,"I have to admit, I was expecting a how-to on Transendental Meditiation. This book is 308 pages on why you should pay $1000 to go to a center and learn TM.TM may be wonderful, but the book actually made me feel wary. I was originally drawn to TM by news reports of lowered blood pressure and stress reduction in practicers The book's emphasis on all the wonderful things you get, with very little effort, and very little detail on how, smacked, just a bit, of secret societies and too-good-to-be-true, $1000, instant-fixs.And, to be honest, I wasn't looking for a sales tool, I was looking for a how-to, so I feel a little silly and a little duped."
1,Group should be renamed,"Sorry, the purile crap produced by these ""musicians"" surpasses the term ""bites"" as might be associated with the creature named the eel. I think the group should rename itself ""Remora"", because for the love of GOD this group and its music SUCKS!This is definitely America where everyone can truly make a substantial living even for producing irritating noise. The limited success of this group also illustrates that people will buy anything no matter how dreadful the product. The existance of this group should discourage all efforts to eliminate the pirating of music because the crap produced by these people certainly doesn't justify the expenditure of any money."
4,Many good songs missed....,Love all that the Eels have to offer but I agree with other reviews that many great songs were missed.Mark Everett is one of the true geniuses of our 21st century music....but this concert could have been better.
2,do not listen to the hype,"I read many raving reviews of this album and bought it, but now I am thinking if I have listened to the same album??? It seems pretenscious mediocrity, some people talking some ""profound"" bull and then the music coming, unfortunately most all of it un-interesting. This band has ambitions but no creative talents. They think they can make music like Pink Floyd but what comes out is garage sale."
1,do not buy this cd,"I was enticed by the words of the others but it is just plain bad. I really like lift your skinny fists... but this album is a waste of time and money. I enjoy what they do when they do it, but there is a total of maybe 5 minutes of good stuff spread out amongst 40 minutes of wailing and some guy talking- who cares? This CD is BOGUS, please do not get fooled like I was."
1,Very anti-American band,"It doesn't really matter how ""epic"" this music is, because this bands personal ""politics"" are so overwhelming and distracting.As it turns out, the band members are extremely anti-American. Not only on this album, but others, where the music and liner notes are riddled with ""new world order"" and anti-America propaganda, blaming America for an impending apocaplypse and cheering on the 9/11 attacks. My personal politics are left, but all of this is too much to take, especially from hate-mongering Canadians who don't even live here (and yet choose to record half their material in Chicago).I'm sure this CD is always in Osama Bin Laden's rotation, but it sure isn't going to be in mine. Go with Sigur Ros instead."
4,Postapocalyptic junkie chamber music?,"I picked up f#a#infinity on the faith of hearing part of an mp3 of the Dead Flag Blues and haven't regretted it at all. It was my first introduction to whatever genre of music this is -- ""sonic landscape"" or whatnot.Describing GYBE has been attempted by many other reviewers and I'm not sure it's an easy task. Appropriate adjectives include haunting, warm, menacing, dissonant and melodic and patternless at first.It is a record that gets rewarding after a few listens, and it works best late at night as ambient music. Then it shines. The subtleties show through and you wonder whattheheck they did to that guitar (or was it a cello?) to make such a noise. It's gorgeous for those with a taste for the thoughtfully surreal.Four stars is to show my great respect, but also the fact that it has limited appeal depending on one's mood & the time."
4,blew my mind.,"this album gives me goosebumps.it sends me through a roller-coaster of emotions!it is totally epic.this was the first album i ever heard by godspeed in my life, so it was a pretty much life changing moment. haha.it needs to be listened to in one sitting though,no other way should be allowed."
4,meloncholy but beautiful,Definately a band who is way ahead of their time. the music isn't music but some sort of painted landscape of guitar and violin.. truely amazing. truely sad. truely beautiful.
5,Godspeed you black Emperor! ....need I say more?,"Godspeed you black emperor! is probably one of the best bands I've ever heard. f#a#oo is just a masterpiece. Filled with spooky sounds from various instruments, it takes you to a journey, from your deepest, darkest fears to hell and heaven and back. You will not feel the same. You will look at yourself diffirently. This will frighten the livin' sh** out of you."
5,residual music,"This is indeed residual music- a rare find nowadays! In this day and age when you hear a music piece, feel an emotion for four minutes (typically lust), and then move on to the next pleasure. What GSYBE have crafted here is a record that stays with you- it lingers in your mind, pulling with both musical intensity and philisophical beauty. This is art that makes you think! To give comparisons musically is a daunting task- obvious comparisons to the Dirty Three are inevitable, but there are also tinges of late Sonic Youth (see Anagrama), A Minor Forest, Tortoise, and Slint. What makes this band different from the aforementioned is its commitment to storytelling- they have the ability to craft worlds of caustic decline and aural terror. This is not a concept album, however- this is a soundtrack for the imagination."
4,Building a soundscape,"Alternative music always seems to be able to come up with some surprise. Quite often, such a surprise is the synthesis of different styles heard before. But still, the molding of older elements can lead to amazing results. Godspeed You Black Emperor managed to create such a result. I have to say I am a big fan of Mogwai so in a sense, it is no surprise that I like this album. Godspeed etc. use some elements Mogwai made popular, namely slowly building noisy guitars. But then, Mogwai probably took it from somebody else etc. etc. What Godspeed etc. added are violins and tapes so that, in the end, the result is a claustrophobic soundscape. The CD is never boring although it clearly violates everything people ""know"" about song writing. Plus, I have to say, now that Sonic Youth can't produce long and non-boring musical paitings any longer, it's good to hear somebody else can."
5,just listen,"If you feel like a prisoner in your own life, you will appreciate this music. The beginning hit me especially hard. The stoicism of the spoken word is truly a rapture in itself. It brings you closer to what you have always feared."
5,"rich, textured, beautiful.","As with all reviews, I am weary of exhausting the coveted (maybe not so much anymore) 5 star rating, but I believe that this album is truly worthy. This album has reinstated my excitement with the music industry (a feeling I haven't felt since I first started collecting music). Godspeed You Black Emperor! do more than play, they paint. I rarely find music which invokes such vivid, theatrical images in my mind that all I can do is sit an let it all in."
2,far from thrilled,"This camera is way less then i expect.colors are dull, and recording feature soundslike a tin can. it may not be the most expensivecamera out there but i expected more for the cost."
3,OK yea i said o.k.,when i took it out the box....IT FELT CHEAPThe battery life needs more power. Panasonic has yet to come out with a driver for XP. The still images are compared to a PHD camera (push here dummy). This is a low end model. As far as video goes....i love it. I have had nothing but fun and thrills. If you can get it for...cheaper than list.... it really is a good deal. I would suggest holding out though
2,Not thrilled,"The camera feels cheap and the included software is (bad)! I will have to buy a firewire card and cable, which will mean that I can't use my laptop to edit video, which was the original plan. I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm not thrilled with this item."
5,Perfect for my picky eating 3 year old,"I began searching for vitamins recently since my 3 year old son has decided that most every food is ""yucky"" with the exception of chicken tenders, french fries, macaroni, cheese and just a few other foods. He will not eat any vegetables besides potatoes so needs his greens. Was worried these would end up with the cabinet of 'yucky' vitamins. First time he tried he asked for another, and thought they were like candy. So now every evening before bed I have no problem with giving him his daily vitamin. The animal shapes just make it more fun, we guess which one will be drawn out tonight!"
3,Average In Flames / Dark Tranquillity clone,"Perfection in Pain is a much better album. If you have it you can ignore this one. If not, log off now and go buy PiP. The songs and the playing is OK but it doesn't get you in the same mood as PiP. Sounds too much like 1000's of other Goetheburg clone bands."
4,Powerful!,"This is an amazing piece of work that does everything right: raw edge, intimate setting, great sound, balanced song selection. I used to hang out at this club in the 1980's. I just put the disc back on tonight for the first time in a while and was telling a friend affiliated with Interscope about it and came here to get the link. I was surprised to see no reviews. In short: Great disc Mark (Mr. B)!"
1,This book is completely out of date.,"There has been so much new information since this book was written, including significant new information about pre-Clovis people. It was last edited in 1992, making it 18 years out of date, given the fast moving world of American prehistory.Interested in more up to date history? Try The First Americans by Adovasio, or The Settlement of the Americas by Dillehay. There may be newer publications as well, but these two are balanced and extensive. Dillehay's book requires attention and study, but it is worth it."
3,Should have known...,"Absolutely loved the look when it came out of the box... However, after about 2 weeks on my car all the black letters fell off. Should have known... it's a Ford."
4,"Exciting, accessible 20th century music","I liked most the concerto's third movement. At about 8 minutes it has a long slow section with a recurring motif of 11 notes, building to a gargantuan climax. I also appreciated the tone-poem ""La mer a Cassis"" which struck me as Debusssyist. It has a chromatic figuration in the middle range and a melody above, and then later a long descending chromatic figuration with the melody in the left hand. I also liked ""La, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaute, luxe, calme et volupte"", with its modal melody and occasional fauxbourdon harmonization. Five stars for these parts! I hope Ms. Silver brings out her second piano concerto soon."
2,NOT THE BEST,"I think this book was stupid unless you want to take up time its good for that. thats why i gave 2 stars otherwise it was stupid.i thought it was stupid because branwell is suspected of hurting his baby half sister so he desides not talk because he is ashamed of being seduced by the baby sitter and she the who hurt his baby half sister so he's juvenile behavioral center,suspected of a horrible crime he did't do and won't tell what relly happened so his best friend connor try's to get something out of him but he won't talk so connor remember the story of the paralyzed frenchman who wrote a whole book with the blink of his left eye they used that for communication.I think thats stupid because branwell is not paralyzed. after a while he desides to talk and the baby sitter loses her job the baby lives.the end"
4,"Good book, but not exellent","Being an avid Koningsburg reader, I enjoyed Silent to the Bone, but I thought that many parts of the book were confusing, or could have been done with better editing. I adored the relationship between Conner and Margaret. I thought that Koningsburg should have simplified many aspects of family connections, but have gone into greater detail about Margaret and Branwell's relationship.She did a fabulous job with Margaret and Conner's relationships. I loved hearing about Branwell's backround."
5,Very moving,I find that this book is fantastic. I found that I was so intrigued by this book that I ended up reading long after midnight. This book is about testing loyalty and one's journey. It is also somewhat of a mystery
5,Silent to the Bone book reveiw,"I really liked the book Silent to the Bone because it had many things you could learn about. It always had you guessing what would happen next. It gets you hooked where you can't put the book down. It was a little confusing in the beginning with all the names but I figured it out. It took place in Martha's house, the Zamborska's house, and the Behavioral Center. Branwell's baby sister goes into a coma and went to the hospital. That is when Branwell went silent.Bran had to go to the Behavioral Center. His friend Conner id dure that Bran didn't do it so he and his sister Martha investigate through a series of people. Something happened and they are going to find out. To see what happens next I guess you will have to read the book."
5,Awesome!!!,"I thought that the book ""Silent To The Bone"" was excellent. I love the way Koningsburg worded this book. Branwell Zamborska is accused of dropping his sister on her head. But, he can't speak in his defense. See, when he called the emergency operator, he can't utter a single sound. His best friend, Connor, remembers a book he read called ""Diving Bell and The Butterfly"" where a guy is paralyzed from the neck down and he wrote the book by having a man say the alphabet to him and when he came to the letter he wanted he'd blink. Connor likes that so he does that, but just to communicate to Branwell. I don't want to give away the ending so read it for yourself and find out if you like it!!"
4,Good book...weak ending.,"Silent to the Bone was a good book. I couldn't put it down, but the ending, in a way, was kinda perdictible. When I reached the end, I was kinda upset of how it turned out. If there was a sequel to this book, I would probably buy it. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it."
4,A moms perspective,"I would reccommend this book for ages 12 and up, not 9-12 as your reading level suggests. I enjoyed the interesting word games, strong characterizations & insight into young minds but found the plot slightly contrived. Never-the-less the book held my attention from beginning to end. SIAS: Coming-of age book, dealing with mature subject matter including, teen angst, loss and denial. The book will explain!!"
4,Another Great Read! by Rachel,"Silent to the bone by E.L. Konigsburg is about a boy named Branwell who is accused of hurting his little sister, Nikki, and is sent to a Behavior Center. One of the few people who believe that Branwell didn't hurt Nikki is Branwell's best friend, Conner. Conner goes about finding clues that will help him prove Branwell's innocence.When I first read the title, I got the impression that this was a scary story. As I read the summary on the back of it, the book became more interesting to me, and I became more curious about the plot. Then I read it. I couldn't stop reading! As I read Silent To The Bone, I gathered clues along with Conner. I felt like a detective.I would reccommend this book for mature audiences, 12 and older. This book contains some questionable content, but it doesn't take anything away from this great book. If you like mystery or law, you will enjoy Silent To The Bone."
4,Utopia??? I think not...,"This book is a great teacher of how people in the extremes of society live. First it depicts a utopian society where everything is smoothly run, but on the other hand, there is the Jewish community in a strongly anti-Semitic environment. However, it shows that the kid living in the utopia is not nearly as content as the Jew living in Germany because he is not allowed to have any emotions or beliefs of his own. If anything at all, you should read this book to show you that you should pursue what you believe in without conforming to the ideas of others just because they tell you so."
4,silence is not absence to the deaf,"What I loved about this book was the people. I would love to talk with Branwell and Connor over coffee. I would love to talk with them about whatever. to play their games. to talk in their codes. to be a part of their world.Of course, I mean that I would love to be a part of their world before Branwell fell into his own silent world.This story is great not because of the mystery involved. Not because of the suspense. It is great because it depicts a friendship between two young people that survived a terrible and unusual tragedy. I would love to have friends like Branwell and Connor. This book allowed me to glimpse what such a life would be like.Read it to remember your friends. Read it to be a part of their friendship."
2,Do not read,I did not like this book. I read to pg 71 and was bored to death. I do not understand what was happening and regret ever buying it.
1,Not appropriate for the age it was intended,This book contained questionable material that may be okay for older audiences. It should not be marketed to 10-12 year olds.
1,Disappointed,"As usual, Konigsburg has turned out a well-written book centered around a complicated plot. However, as a middle school teacher, I cannot in good conscience recommend the book to the students in my school because of the content. The plot centers around the sexual ensnarement of an adolescent boy by an older female. While the sexual activities of the female were not described in great detail, they were present. As an adult, I realize that these things do happen in our society. I found the psychological insights interesting, but as a teacher, I do not feel the parents in my school would appreciate me recommending this book for middle school children. I do not support censorship, but I was blindsided by the content of the book which many in my small southern community would find offensive."
4,silent to the bone,the story is about a boy that drops is sister that is 5month old they called 911 and the boy would not say anything the boy would not say nothing at all. they took him to a jail. his mom would ask him what happen he would say any thing.
2,Rats. Obvious and cheap work from a good writer.,"Who did it first, DiCamillo with Tale of Despereaux, or Konigsburg with this?What I mean is, fine writers putting out silly, under edited cliches.The bad guy was obvious by page three.Konigsburg can write well without silly cliched sex subplots. (That niche is filled by Judy Blume.)And, as another reviewer pointed out, gaping, unexplained holes in the main storyline. (Maybe if she hadn't had to put in the ham-handed subplot, she would have had time to make sense of the main one.)"
1,not suitable for children under 16,"This book is completely inappropriate.The plot centers around the sexual ensnarement of an adolescent boy by an older female. While the sexual activities of the female were not described in great detail, they were present. There are also allegations of insestual child abuse toward an infant.It reads like a trashy novel or tabloid news. The sexual innuendos were very inappropriate for this age group. We continue to complain as a society about inappropriate youth behavior and yet we continue to expose them to inappropriate content. What can we expect to get? Middle school students are embarrassed and appalled that they are reading this book as assigned reading. It should notbe the book they assign for a middle school reader.Hard to believe this is written for 10-13 year olds."
3,Editing errors make it hard to fully enjoy this book.,"I'm disappointed in this book - not in the plot, but the way the story's told. I was surprised to find that it's very poorly edited. I try not to be nitpicky about things like improper subjunctive use (who cares), but I also found several instances of left-out words - prepositions, articles - little words without which some sentences failed to make much sense.The sentence structure overall was often clunky, and there was way WAY too much detail about people's relationships to each other - sentences something like ""Mrs. A looks after B., who was my father's grad student's stepmom's kid."" I spent ages wading through sentences like this, and then they usually ended up not being relevant anyway.All this combined into a rather frustrating read. I finished it because I did want to know what would happen, and I found the characters interesting, but I can't imagine this book is going to win many children's hearts."
1,This is NOT a children's book!,"Although this book is supposedly a children's book, the 13 year old boy who is the main character is sexually involved with a 20 year old girl named Vivian. Numerous graphical descriptions of ""accidently"" walking in on Vivian in the bathtub are described. Vivian having sex with Morris her boyfried is described. Worst yet, the 13 year old boy tells is friend about an encounter with Vivian: ""Then a very ... adult thing happened."" ""You mean like Viagra?"" ...The author of this book should be ashamed. This book doesn't belong in any child (or adults) hands."
4,Criminal??,"Silent to the Bone is written by E.L. Konigsburg. It is about a boy named Branwell Zamborska who is taken to a juvenile behavior center after he allegedly dropped his six month old half sister, Nikki. THe only reason Branwell can't tell the truth abput what happened the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is the fact that he won't talk. After he called to his babysitter, Vivian, and told her that Nikki was breathing funny, he had not said another word. Not to his parents, not to the doctors, not to anybody. Connor Kane, Branwell's best friend is asked to help. He sees Branwell after school everyday and uses flashcards to communicate with him. With the information he gathers from Branwell, Connor goes on a journey through Branwell's past and uncovers the truth of Branwell's silence and of what happened, that night, at the Zamborska household."
4,My Review: Silent to the Bone,"I liked Silent to the Bone. It was very interesting and icluded some mystery and some suspense. My favorite scene is probably when Branwell starts speaking again. He then tells a lot of answers to questions the characters, and maybe the readers, are thinking. It is my favorite scene because it basically ends the whole mystery and lets you know what was going on with Branwell during the 911 call. It is very informative.This book has a great plot. It was a little hard to put it down. It also used a lot of descriptive words that gave a vivid image to some parts. I think it is appropriate for ages 10 and above, since it has a few parts that seem a little wrong, like a young kid kissing an unrelated woman who only had a towel wrapped around her. And that concludes my review."
4,Compelling,This book kept me on the edge of my seat. A must buy for all kids ages 10 and up. I coudn't put it down. I could totaly relate to it.
5,Well worth reading.,"While it was clear from the beginning that Branwell did not hurt the baby and that Vivian had been screwing with him, I wanted to find out exactly what and why. The book was like a puzzle, each chapter being a piece you had to fit together. Wonderfully suspenseful, perfect for curling up in a chair with on a chilly foggy day. Connor was the best friend a person could ask for. Both he and Branwell seemed very intelligent. Connor's sister Margaret was my favorite character. Vivian was a snake. The only thing I wished I could change about the book would be making her go to trial for hurting Nikki instead of just losing her job."
5,Silent to the Bome,"In ""Silent to the Bone,"" a nanny from England comes to a U.S. University to work as an au pair. She is looking after thirteen years old Branwell and his baby sister Nicki. All is well until this babysitting job goes completely wrong, and Branwell holds a secret too deep to speak the truth. The only evidence is a phone call with the 911 operator on one line, and no body on the other. Branwell's best friend, Connor, tries to unscramble this big mix up, and discover the truth of what really happened.While Connor struggles to help his friend, the book does its job as the most suspenseful and page turning novel written by e. l. Konigsburg. The story moves along at an even pace, as the characters work together to solve the mystery. You won't be able to put the book down. The ending is the very surprising, very realistic truth, about what really happened"
1,weak,considering the Legacy of Jam&lewis they could have done way better than this mess.you know it's a joke when Janet Jackson&Luther Vandross are doing a duet? that's the funniest thing that i've ever heard.cuz vocally they are world's apart.the rest of this cd is dead weight to the ears.
5,Wan to See What You're Getting? Video Review!,Length:: 2:06 MinsCheck out this video review if you want to see with your own eyes what exactly you're getting when you buy the Complete Far Side!
5,All you need,"What can you say? The Far Side is in my opinion the funniest comic strip ever to grace print. I have found myself laughing out loud and having uncontrolable spurts of chuckling when reading The Far Side. And most of this is accomplished with ONE panel. It's a testament to the genius of Gary Larson. And these two volumes comprise almost every far side strip as well much bonus material. If you are a fan of Mr. Larson's work, I would highly suggest selling your seperate volumes and purchasing this comprehensive set. Happy laughing!"
5,18 lbs of fun,"Wish there were more. I seem to recall more cartoons about wiener dogs (the weinerkings). Maybe they are just from a different book, and never were in news papers. There are funny stories about the author in between years of the cartoon run that give insight to his imagination and his life as a child."
5,Funny Stuff!!,"I've loved Gary Larson's Far Side strip from the first time I read it, so owning this complete collection is a real treat for me. It's as beautifully packaged as any art book and has several essays by Gary. I giggled and laughed all the way through both books. Classic stuff!"
5,Best Medicine,"Can anyone with a sense of humor not appreciate and cherish the contribution of Gary Larson?His work is brilliant and hysterically funny. It is without a doubt genius in humor. This book is well worth the price. Let us not forget that laughter, aside from being the best medicine, is essential to all humans and should be done as often as possible. Especially by your bosses.PS- don't give this to anyone that had abdominal or thoracic surgery."
5,Really on the Far Side!,"Bought this as a birthday present for my husband, - and he was over the moon! Great gift for someone who enjoys the wonderful and mad world og Gary Larson."
4,Cool,"The comics are great and so are all the little extras. But the books are bloody huge making them hard to read and I don't unless I'm excessivly carefull that they'll hold up for a long time. But if you want the whole collection this is the price you pay, and I say it's worth it."
2,A heavy set and poorly designed,"What is most disappointing about this collection is the format in which it is presented. So large and heavy and such poor design on each the pages. Each cartoon is framed with a phony looking bevel which I would guess was intended to be a picture frame of sorts with the copy beneath, then placed randomly (and small) on a generic pattern background.One has to look no further than the recent and very excellent Peanuts collections or the Dennis the Menace books to find respectfully designed collections. The Far Side collection Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are poorly done and an insult to such a wonderful and memorable cartoon that a generation of us would look forward to cracking open the paper each morning to see the daily Far Side."
5,Excellent,"This book gives me hours of laughter, especially for one that doesn't even have time to sit down and relax except the weekends. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys laughing, or if they are Gary Larson fans!"
3,"Why Gary, Why?!","Though this collection is nostalgic for a die hard fan like myself, I can't suppress my disappointment at how many of these cartoons have been retouched in COLOR. This coupled with the small panel size and wasted page space is actually quite aggravating dispite the 1000 cartoons not previously released in book form."
5,Very Nice Books,"I grew up reading Gary's The Far Side. Having his entire collection is great, and the quality of these books are outstanding. But beware, these books are huge, they did not fit well into my library, because they are so tall. Not that I am complaining, I love them."
5,Great collection...,...unfortunately it's a bit expensive. I think it might be better to buy the individual volumes.
4,this guy is weird,a lot of people get crushed by animals and there are many cows. and aliens. he says egad and cummings a lot. these pictures are funny and they make me laugh
5,Larson's Legacy,"A fantastic collection of cartoons, which have graced countless bathroom walls in their calendar form for years. The Complete Far Side collection comes in a 2 volume box set, each one with a solid well bound cover and heavy paper which will take the punishment of constant perusal. I would recommend the books as gifts or coffee table accessories to anyone young or old. The timeless humour has enough bite to offend the occasional prude while being so universally identifiable that the prudes of the world would also likely find something within the pages of these books to bring an ashamed smile to their face. It is a meaningful addition to any humour fans collection. You will not be disappointed with the quality of the books or their content."
5,Excellent and comprehensive,Every Far Side ever published - can't go wrong with that. Hardback with good quality paper. A perfect resource for PowerPoint presentations.
3,Somewhat excessive,"I bought this set in 2007. It is big and well bound.The problem with it is that each volume is big & heavy and takes a lot of space to read. In a lot of ways, someone might be better off with a collection of lighter, paper bound versions. It is sort of like do you buy hard bound books or paper bound? I usually buy paper bound as they are more convenient and are easy to carry around. Others, who primarily read in one place, prefer hard bound.Also, I am not a fan of colouring images that originally were black and white. To me, they are more subtle and interesting when in their original black and white."
5,A great collection,"These volumes are great! The comics are hilarious, the color repos were made very well, the books are handsome and would dress up any bookself! Everything you would expect and more!"
5,The Complete Far Side,EXCELLENT! The delivery man asked if I was having gold bricks delivered!Lots of fun in only the way Gary Larson can provide!
3,You can't go back home.,"Excellent quality, however I was surprised that the strip was not as funny as I once thought. I guess this proves that some things are better left to memory. Quite possibly, the content that once seemed totally outrageous, just doesn't seem that outrageous anymore. Or, maybe you don't notice the monotonous repitition when reading only one panel per day in the newspaper. However, when you sit down and read 3 or 4 straight years worth, you finally just want to say. ""Egad, Cummings, cows really aren't all that funny!!!!"""
3,should be on CD-ROM or DVD,"I love the Far Side and would love to own it complete, but I have no room for this elephantine set. Why didn't the publisher also make a CD-ROM or DVD version, which anyone would have room for? ""5"" for content, ""1"" for format = ""3"" rating"
2,Disappointed with quality,"Imagine my surprise upon opening a sealed copy of this set to discover significant grease stains on the pages of the first volume. For what this set represents and what it costs, this is unacceptable."
3,It's Gotta be a Winner!!,"I don't even have it yet, but Amazon says I will by next Wednesday or so. I've read Larson for as long as I've been able, and at around $50 less than retail how can you not buy it? Love those cows!! Please come back Gary!"
4,You have to learn to savor Gary Larson,"Great coffee table book. In truth, as a follower of the Far Side, I have already seen most of the cartoons in both volumes. But it is fun to review them and have them on the coffee table to show to others. The humor relies heavily on word plays in American English and American culture. Some of the humor is lost on readers from other language cultures ( I happen to live outside of the U.S.)"
3,Only ok,"Well, I don't recommend this book. It jumps all over the place and the research is not clear. It just picks and chooses a few nice stories. If you can, just read it at the library if you are curious. It doesn't have depth to it and it seems geared towards moms who work and just don't want more kids to take care of. What if you want only one child or can only have one and you are a Stay at Home Mom? This is not for you. It has a few good phrases. Otherwise it just is like reading opinions of a few people. Get the book The Seven Common Sins of Parenting an Only Child by Carolyn White. That book is much better."
2,Parenting An Only Child,I thought that this book was okay but it was more for working and older parents. It didn't really help me as a stay at home mom.
2,Geared toward the 90's Career Woman,"This book strongly emphasizes the 90's Career Woman, and undervalues the stay-at-home Mom. It comes dangerously close to insulting the stay-at-home Mom and labeling her as an antiquated species. While there are a few good tidbits of wisdom in this book, overall it fails to offer strong advice and helpful guidelines for raising the only child. After extensive research on this topic, I can strongly recommend the books: ""You and Your Only Child: The Joys, Myths, and Challenges of Raising an Only Child"" by Patricia Nachman, Ph.D. and Andrea Thompson, and ""Keys to Parenting the Only Child"" by Carl E. Pickhardt."
5,"Wonderful, informative book","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My husband and I recently decided to make our daughter our ""only"". He, being an only, of course is confident that all will be fine but I needed some reassurance and data to make me feel more comfortable. This book not only made me feel very comfortable and happy about our decision but also made me aware of the different pitfalls that may occur in the one child family - very avoidable pitfalls if aware of them before they occur. I highly recommend this book to any parents of only children or those contemplating the decision."
3,Light weight,"If you want moral support for your choice to have one child, this author will give it to you. If you want hard, unbiased evidence that debunks the persistent myths, you won't find much. It's not enough to say ""I spoke to so-and-so who is an only child and she thinks it's fine."""
2,Author Makes Digs At Those Families With More Than One Child,"This book is not about the joys and challenges of raising an only child. This book is about defending the only child. Throughout the book the author makes petty an immature remarks as to why having an only child is the only way to go. I purchased this book because I was on the fence as to whether or not I should have another child. I wanted an unbiased opinion on the pros and cons of having an only child to assist me with my decision making. Unfortunately, I am still on the fence."
5,Covers all the basics,In recent years one-child families have risen: Parenting An Only Child covers all the basics; from understanding the decision or need to have only one child to disciplining the only child and fostering his independence and communication skills with peers. Singe parenting and family networks are also covered.
2,Not the booked I'd hoped it would be,"This book was mislabled when they gave it the title of Parenting and Only Child. Its not so much about parenting an only child as it is about WHY people choose to have an only child, and what to say to those who ask if you're going to have another one. I was greatly disappointed."
5,Parenting An Only Child,Answered all my questoins and concernsI struggled with whether or not to give my child a sibling and this bookdiscussed all my and my husband's issues and Helped us decide to stickwith one. Her parenting ideas really work. One of the best sections ofthe book challenges every myth you've ever heard about only children.Read this and you won't need any other advice.
5,Spontaneous Inventions,"I saw Bobby McFerrin do this show live. While there's nothing like a live performance, this DVD comes the closeset to actually being there. It's infectious live and will make you smile watching the DVD.Bobby McFerrin is a truly singular talent and I think you will enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Unfair,"I probably shouldn't have bought this dvd. I had just been to a Bobby McFerrin concert, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and have a couple of his cd's, which I also like. But this particular dvd became just plain boring after a while. There wasn't the wonderful audience participation, which was so much fun in the concert. There were too many rambling jazz numbers that went on much too long.The reason I titled this review ""unfair"" is because I am essentially a classically trained musician who mostly listens to classical music. I like some jazz, and I think McFerrin is a genius, but sometimes any jazz can become repetitive and for me, tiresome. I feel sure that a jazz fan would look at this dvd differently."
4,A fabulous collection Carpenters' songs from 1974-1978,"The Singles 1974-1978 will of course have no songs that aren't on previous compilations, however it contains the best hits from ""Sweet Sweet Smile"" to ""Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft"". The most pleasant surprise is ""Can't Smile Without You"". This CD contains a slightly different version, with an unheard line in the beginning...""You know I can't smile without you, can't smile without you. I can't laugh and I can't sleep, I don't even talk to people I meet."" Karen's vocals throughout are superb. This is definitely worth adding to your Carpenters' collection if you don't already have it!"
5,Easy and enjoyable listening,"All around a good CD to listen to. Karen had that unmistakeable and unforgetable voice. I think this collection exhibits more of her vocal range than the more popular Singles 1969-1973 collection does.As other reviewers have noted, the Carpenters' style was changing in the mid 70s and they were experimenting a bit with different sounds. Even so, this collection is easy to listen to and has some memorable songs such as Only Yesterday, I Need to Be in Love, and Won't Last A Day Without You. Whether you remember these songs from the mid 70s or are new to the Carpenters, this is a worthwhile addition to your CD collection. (Arguably, Karen Carpenter is the greatest female vocalist of all time.)"
5,This is the real thing,"If you were to listen to this album, you understand why I hate it when other singers cover his songs. He wrote the songs and the music himself so he should be the only one singing them. If you want to hear ""Turn your lights down low"", you need to buy this version, not Lauryn Hill's."
5,Lovely memories,This album takes me back to my youth living close the major West Indian area of London where this music came from every window or so it seemed. Great album
4,Great but not his best.,"I love Bob Marley, his lyrics and delivery. But, I listen to him alot mainly because of his band The Wailers. Aston Familyman, Carlton, Wya, Anderson etc. Superb musicians who do not get enough credit yet they were 'holding it down' for Bob. He knew their value which is good. Try getting Survival & Rastaman Vibration. Now, that's Roots Reggae!"
1,Caution contains the wrong discs,I've ordered this twice from Amazon and each time Legend discs are housed in the Exodus packaging.
4,It's got the third-best reggae song of all time on it!,"Bob Marley's Exodus is by a long way his most accomplished recording and as such it is a really listenable reggae album. All the tracks are either good or very good, with the exception of Waiting In Vain, which combines all of Marley's songwriting genius with his fantastic trademark loose-but-passionate vocals, and the most complimentary accompaniement from the Wailers in the whole of Marley's exulted back catalogue, all rolled up into one great production. It is truly a masterpiece and without question one of the top three reggae tracks of all time, not far behind Hotel California by the Eagles and Dreadlock Holiday by 10CC. All together now: ""I don't like cricket-ah! oh no. I love it-ah! yeah."""
3,Sound quality is poor,I had this CD when it originally came out on tape. I was happy to see that I could purchase it on CD. I immediately opened it when it arrived and played it on my computer. The sound quality was awful! I then decided to take it to another CD player in the house and was again dissapointed. The CD arrived new still in the package so I don't know what happened.
5,Truly Handy!,I've never understood the appeal of the $300 changing table when changing pads like these are available instead. This changing pad can be used anywhere and is easily folded up and secured with the use of a velcro strap. The pattern is attractive and the pad can be machine washed. We're very pleased with this purchase.
3,doesn't hold pees,this is a low quality changer which won't hold liquid (pee) .it is good for putty only. but I used it for few years as a travel changer so it was useful.
2,Ripped 2nd Wash,"I loved the idea of this and had a vinyl one that came with my diaper bag. I was excited to get this one because it could fold up and go anywhere. However, it ripped the second time I washed it. These things are meant to be used and just thrown in the washer. I sewed it back up but it keeps coming apart at different locations - what a pain."
1,Did not work,Used the batteries it came and it didn't work. Put new Duracell in. It flickered on and went off for good. I sent it back for a refund.
3,"Useful, but...","I ordered this a bit ago to correct some problems with a chair I'd bought and assembled... and then threw away the allen wrench that came with it. Ooops.For tightening the screws, this tool (you actually get two in the package), was very useful. Several sizes and it fits easily in your hand.The only real problem, and the reason it gets three stars, is that the wrenches don't lock into place, and can be a little loose. This is, as you can imagine, something of an issue. For a tool I'll use only once in a blue moon, this is fine, but if you plan to buy this for regular use, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,more great sounds from the folks at Kranky...,"After hearing a demo tape of her work, Kranky Records (superhip Chicago label who have given us Bowery Electric and Labradford among others) immediately wanted Jessica Bailiff to make a record for them. This record, recorded at Low's 20 Below studio by that band's frontman Alan Sparhawk (the other two members of Low also contribute), is a beautiful blend of quiet female vocals and effects-laden guitar; sounds a bit like Flying Saucer Attack meets Low. Yummy!"
4,SUPERIOR NOIR!!!,"I can only add to what others before me have already stated. I just spent the afternoon watching 4 Alpha dvd noirs and this is certainly the most bizzare/dreamlike noir of the batch ( BLONDE ICE, INNER SANCTUM, & WHISPERING CITY being the others ) and certainly the worse video transfer (though WHISPERING CITY is also pretty awful!!!). Jumps, cut-aways, splices, splotches, murky audio, etc., make viewing a challenge. I actually thought they had switched reels somewhere!!!I can only add (BEG!!!) that this unique noir someday gets the quality up-grade it really deserves. A top-notch noir classic with great performances by all involved! Robert Cummings has never been better.SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW PLEASE RESTORE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!p.s.,.......the source material for both BLONDE ICE & INNER SANCTUM were QUITE GOOD, so if you're thinking of either of these two as possible purchases then go ahead, they're super bargains of very acceptable prints!!!"
4,Definitely Worth Watching,"I don't have much to add to the other reviews, which are very good.The villain is the best-drawn figure of all the characters. I loved how his controlling nature extends to the car, where he can control the speed from the back seat. He was truly menacing and evil--you can really understand his wife's fear.Michele Morgan is beautiful--I didn't know who she was and apparently she didn't act in many films in the USA though she did plenty of work in Europe. She's still alive as of October 2008--88 years old."
3,Low rating because not perfect quality,While this piece is just beautiful the one I received had dark marks on the small metal name plaque. Since I bought it as a gift and did not have time to return it I was disappointed in the quality of the one I received. The actual figurine is stunning but the discolored metal made it look cheap especially for the money I paid for it.
2,could be a good prouduct .....,"Great value, great price and high quality, what more could you ask for......where to start;1st... lets start with a frame that fit my NC plate. I had to modify my plate so that I could use the frame.2nd... how about a tab or some way to use all 4 screws to hold the plate and frame. due the manufacturer over looking this feature the frame is bouncing every time the window or tail gate door is shut. i have solved this with a wire and two holes.the product is made from OK material however, I would not recommend this product... find a more thought out design."
1,Ridiculous price,The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous. 5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each. Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts. You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.
5,It Works!,"Finally, a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork. You feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level. It stays with you and does not leave you feeling dopey or spent when it wears off."
3,Super sayan drink????,"I took it at 5am yesterday. It is now almost 3am the next day and I am laying in bed and skin feels tingly, can't sleep at all. I feel like I am at super sayan level 4, power of the red monkey. I could shoot ki blast out the window if I wanted too. Maybe some kame hame wave's too."
3,okay for starters,"The author did her homework pretty well as far as finding out the traditional meanings of hundreds of different colors, numbers, animals, etc. -- details that can make your gifts more personal and thus more significant, but too often she doesn't tell us WHICH culture, for instance, believes amber is an antidote to impotence, so we have the meanings but not the sources, which makes this data just a bit untrustworthy. If you're really interested in the topic, you'd be best off using this book merely as a big set of clues, then doing more research on your own."
4,Great Christmas Album!!!,"If you're tired of the typical Christmas songs then this is for you. The music is soulful and more geared for the R&B listener. This album takes the usual Xmas songs and adds ""Blackness"" and I would recommend this CD to anyone."
3,Great game wish I could finish it,"I loved the game and got quite far with it, until for no reason it kept bouncing me back to the desktop. Tried getting advice from activision and still no joy. Love the game, the bugs are a bother"
5,Wish there were more like it,"Fantastic graphics, great game control, varied action, good plot. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems installing the game or running - EXCEPT - it did crash a lot. But with frequent saves, it was still worth the inconvenience. (It did not crash my machine!). Finally, it was not so difficult that it could not be finished without a ""hint book"" like the Sierra games."
1,A childish bore,"If this was supposed to be Charleston's answer to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, it fell well short. Reading this book was a complete waste of time."
5,duel disk is awsome,I think this duel disk is the best! Who cares if it doesnt have the holograms.Besides it is not true for the holograhms to come out anyway.You still can duel faraway.All you have to do is tell the card name(besides magic and trap)and tell theatk points it is to your opponent and let the duel begin!
2,My 7 year old thinks it is useless,"It was a toy I had my son save for. It was a dream come true when he finally got it. But soon after, he realised that it was highly unweildy. To start with it cannot use cards with pastic sleeves on. The cards get damaged when pushing it in and out of the deck zone and the graveyard. It is difficult to use the hand he wears it on to shuffle the cards as some spell cards call for. It is just easier for the real duelists to carry the decks it the deck boxes and play on the game mat. In fact my son and his friends will play on any flat surface with just the cards.It is just a good prop for taking pictures."
1,"Can you say ""Cash cow?""","I'm a 16 year old who--I'm not afraid to admit it-- plays the YGO game, and even watches the show (even if it is horribly dubbed). My younger brother got this ""toy"" the other day, and I must say it's a waste of money. The only other 1-star review was annoyed that it didn't provide holograms, I'm not, since that would be asking to much. However, this thing isn't really good for anything. In America, YGO is targeted at 5-10 year olds. However, if a child of that age were to put one of these on, he'd look rediculous (actually, that goes for all ages). It'd be about half the size of him/her. Second, it's hard to actually put many of the cards in. The monsters are easy enough, but to put the Magic or Traps in, you often have to bend the card.The worst part though, is that the cards fall off easily. Lower your arm, and there goes the game. Why not just buy your kid some booster packs?"
4,A really cool yugioh product,This is one of the best yugioh toys out there. I got mine yesterday and having fun already. I think one of the problems is that the magic/trap card slots are in the front. Put 2 cards at a time in your deck if you want to go fast and not ruin your cards. If you put 3 or more you will ruin them. Bye!!!!
5,"This I sthe best version on the market ""yet""",Lately I have been reviewing Mattel and Yu-Gi-Oh! and it seems that this is just a prototype of the real launcher. THis is A perfect gift to give to a Yu-Gi-Oh fan for now but it's just a prototype and they are trying to make new ones that have the holographic projector. Once prototypes are put you'll Be able to play with the cards in your deck. It is suggested that when you buy this you only use cards that are on the market in that time. You'll need to get upgrades when you put New Booster cards in your deck.
5,TRUTH,For all you parents out there worried about money this is for you. I can see from most of the reviews I read that you don't like the toy. You don't have to like it cause its a toy for kids.Every toy breaks overtime. The only thing you should care about is that the kids are enjoying themselves. You have so little time with your kids at this point in life. Soon they'll be gone and their you'll be looking at pictures when they were seven. This may not be themost durable toy but its a way to show you support their intrests.Give this gift to your kid and his/her face wll ligt up in gratitude.
5,From What I See It Looks Awesome.... begging for dad to get,Educational part is that you can use Math for life points... Finally my friends and I can use a toy that wont have to make us PRETEND we are on the show dueling... wish it had holograms but WHO CARES!! this looks awesome!!
5,Yu-Gi-Oh! It's time to duel!,"Hello. I am Keaton. This toy is a good model after the one on the TV show, but don't expect holograms to pop up. It also keeps your lifepoints (but whenever you lose lifepoints you have to push buttons to set it). It also assists people having trouble with math with the lifepoints. If people tell you that this breaks easily it doesn't. It has a holder for your deck, your graveyard, your monsters, and your spell, magic, and trap cards. If you have cards with card sleeves they won't fit in the duel disk. Watch out when you make the duel disk go from standby mode (split apart) to duel mode (both sides together), the disk might catch you in the middle of its grasp. Overall this is a great toy. Keaton"
4,Really good toy!!,THE NEW YUGIOH DUEL DISK IS COOL! I USE IT WHENEVER I PLAY ONE MOST USEFUL IS IN THE CAR WHERE U WOULDNT NORMALLY BE ABLE TO PLAY WITHOUT THE CARDS SLIDING AROUND OR GETTING RUINED!PROS: MONSTER CARD ZONES FOR ATK OR DEF MODE!!!MAGIC AND TRAP CARD ZONES!!!FIELD CARD ZONE!!!DECK HOLDER!GRAVEYARD!CONS: DECK HOLDER IS KINDA SMALL SO AROUND 60 CARDS WILL FITGRAVEYARD IS SMALL BUT IF U RUN OUT OF SPACE YOUR NOT THAT GOOD JUST KIDDING!NO FUSION DECK ZONE BUT WHAT I DO IS PUT IT IN THE FIELD CARD SLOT!!!NO SIDE DECK ZONE BUT WELL FIGUERE IT OUTCARDS WONT FIT WITH CASES THAT SUCKS SO DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU INTEND TO TAKE CARDS OUT OF THEIR CASES U MIGHT NOT CARE OR YOU MIGHT CARE IF YOUR CARDS ARE NOT IN CASES.I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS YOU OUT!!!!!
5,Yugioh Duel Disk,"Yes! They finally have created one that actually works. Yeah, my little brother bought one of those cheap imatations for like 65 bucks and it wasn't all that great madly either. But this one is superb. I mean it's like Battle City tournament all into a great gift package. i mean now all there needs to be is a tourament which you have to bet your cards in. Wow this is going to be great. To bad it didn't have holographic projectors though. Well at least now Kiaba will be jeloius of me."
2,not the best.... but OK,I like the toy but it hardly sticks to the show and the deck holder wrecks your cards. The people who made this toy didn't really think about realizim. It's supposed to go on your right hand and the magic cards are supposed to go in the back not the front. They also don't make the magic card slots big enough-sometimes...I think it's ok if you don't really care about the reallizim or the condition of your cards.
3,RATHER EXPENSIVE,"As with most products that carry this name, I am shocked at what I got for the cost. I feel like my Saturday morning tv addicted son has me by the bells. For the same amount of cash, I could have got the entire inspector gadget set and six happy meals to boot."
3,MICHAEL MACHADO JR,I think this toy is a little stupid because when you put your magic cards in the slots its in the front and people could see it.Plus its plastic and has no halo projectors Me and my brother Jonathan wanted to get this toy for christmas but we thought it was stupid so we're searching for something new and approved.
4,cool toy,"I have now purchased a duel disk and it is so coool, the only problem is that if your friends dont have one and you duel them you need to hold it downward or they will see your magic and traps and it is a real hassel to look trough your deck or graveyard and the slot for the grave yard is TO SMALL. Besides that it is a great why to attract duelist and i am going to test this fact a toy show at the richland county fair in mansfield ohio this saturday to see if works i will write another review on this item and give the details. till next time. Peace out"
5,DUEL DISK,"The duel disk is light and very durable.It can hold up to 5 magic and trap cards, 5 monster cards and one hidden slot for feld cards like toon world. You get up to 9000 life points and the counter drops by tens's hundred's and thousand's depening on how may life points you want. The bad thing is the counter only goes down so if you play a card to rise your life points you have to click the counter buttons till it gets back to the number that you want it at. Also the counter lights up. Another bad thing is the the duel disk only hold up to 50 cards and the grave yard only holds between 30 and 40 cards. by Shawn D Age 13"
4,Not Bad!,"I was skeptical about getting this toy for my boys, but I'm glad I got it. Not only does it keep them happy, but they play with the thing all the time. I've been waiting for the time they play with it for a couple of hours and then it end up ""lost"" in the rubble like most of their toys that their bored of playing with. Though their too young (ages 9 & 5) to really know how to ""duel"" ,they love making up their own rules or mimicking one of the Yu-gi-oh cartoons. So far its outlasted many attacks and defenses. Their cards stay in one place (instead of all over the floor or table) and they can take the toy with them, especially in the car (where most times I'm looking for lost cards that fall in between seats and on the floor). The cards stay in one place!No regrets here."
5,Best toy out there!!,"Once again, no one should be afraid to admit their age. I'm 14 and I collect YGO cards and everything. I bought my duel disk at toys r us for $36! and trust me its worth it! It has monster slots for both atk and def position. Bad thing is that the magic and traps go in front. But if your careful your opponent wont see them. The LP thing lights up too. um... The deck holder is a little small so I recomend having a deck with no more than 50 cards. Graveyard is really small but hey if your a good duelist then u shouldnt worry about it. My favorite part is the positions. They change quickly so kids beware, cuts and scratches can occur. Everytime you place a card down it makes the little noise like on the show. This is one excellent toy and would make a great christmas gift! Happy Shopping!!"
1,I must say..,"Yugio I think is a great card game, but come on. Kids want to buy this to be like Yugi, ""Hey look I have this gigantic hunk of plastic on my arm, I WILL WIN THE DUEL!"" I think the TV show has major flaws, just stick with the cards. [...]"
2,...,"Ok,i have posted a review before. I have got 2 helpful ratings out of 9. Now,i think that these reviews are getting alittle...unbalanced? I mean come on..ive written a page on actual facts and my own opinions and compared to those 2 sentence reviews saying :"" THIS TOY IS GREAT! YOU PUT MONSTER CARDS DOWN AND IT WORKS! BUY IT!"". i think mine should be better read and not voted on being bad just cuz i think its bad. I dont want ppl who love this duel disk to rate it on not being helpful just cuz i gave it a bad rating. If thats the case, i myself will say no to every rating saying THIS TOY ROX. Whoever reads this,do not vote on weither or not it was a good rating on the toy,but wheter or not my opinion is correct on these reviews being unfavored. Thx."
3,duel disk,"This, toy is awsom it will allow more people to play yu-gi-oh and we won't have to find a table anymore. The problem is how you are supposed to hold your hand and what if you want to search your graveyard or your opponents and what if you have to look through your deck or your oppnent has to look through their deck. This problem needs a solution and then a second moddle so it can improve and get rid of these flaws."
5,Duel Disk? Maybe,"First of all I've never played the CCG (collectible card game)... But I am big fan of the Anime, both US and Japanese versions. From a glance it looks pretty big. It's hard too imagine that a child of 5+ would be using it. The straps that harness the Disk to your arm IS however small enough for a child. Adult and Teen wearers may have some difficulty with the velcro. I fixed the problem by sewing on some additional velcro. The Disk itself is pretty sturdy and kids might want to be careful when switching modes, it kind happens quickly and scratches can happen.With that said I think it's pretty faithful to the Anime. The Cards fit nicely and the mode changes are pretty good. If you are Yu-Gi-Oh cosplayer or need to complete a Halloween costume this item is perfect. I am pretty happy with it. It will complete that Duelist Costume you're trying to create."
2,Don`t Buy this!,Don`t buy this toy.It`s not worth the money.It`s fun until you see what it does to your cards. The sides of my Dark Magician are ruined!
1,Terrible toy - poorly manufactured or poorly designed,"This has been a disappointing toy! I bought this for my son who had been looking forward to this toy. When we got home, we saw that the buttons you push to decrease the life points wont work (you press the buttons but the numbers do not decrease) and when you slide the short platform clockwise (as per the directions) the platform will not lock and it ends up snapping back. We exchanged it for a different one, but we still have the same problems. We are going to try a third time and if that one doesn't work we are getting our money back. This is a cheap toy, and I can't believe that you have to pay almost $30 for something worth about $5."
3,Duel Disk Launcher,"The Duel disk is alright, when you want to go outside and play, and you dont want to sit down on the ground. But if it had a hologram progector in it, this product would earn high value! at least progect the card! but over all I'll reccomend it if your a true yugioh Fan. otherwise....no."
5,Great Fun,This is a great Yu-Gi-Oh product. They use it in the show and now you can use it.It feels like you're in the show.Now you can be part of the action
1,THIS IS DUMB,THIS DUEL DISK IS FAKE ITS PLASTIC AND THE MAGIC AND TRAP CARD ZONES R IN THE FRONT UR OPP WILL SEE THEM AND NO HOLOGRAMS U CANT GET HURT WHEN U ATK IT SUCKS
4,Duel Disk :),"Hi any one whos reading this I think in the future there going to Invent a real duel Disk which HOLOGRAPHIC MONTERS WILL COME OUT. No It will Not take a lightyear and technogly is getting Sick these days. maybe next year there going to invent the real one. Also i Feel Sad that the Duel Disk Lancher wont calalate your Life Point for you.Last,Does this Duel Disk really Knows that your oppent is ready To duel u? And well be able to attack a monster. I Got wait tell technolgy get the real Thing."
3,One of the few out there...,"Ok to start off i like to play the game and all but i didn't think it was practical. Consider this, you have to hold your entire field up the entire time. Your opponent has to be fairly close to see your cards on the field. It can dammage your cards. I believe the official card cases for yugioh are the only cases that works for it. It can't hold too many cards in the grave yard and deck zone. The idea is clever and all but i just don't see how this is going to replace the table and chairs. Well there is my 2 cents about this product."
1,I hate it,"UM this is bad. ive heard the LP counter breaks alot, not enough cards (my deck isnt big [only 46 cards]) but not with protectors! everyone is mad about the M&T slots in front, but after much thinking I figured out the reason. Well, see if the were in back you'd have to be careful not to hit the disk part when you put them in or remove them. W/ them in front you,ve got all the room you need! But there are still more bads than goods. The LP needs to be visible W/out the light on. the buttons only make the LP go down, not up. and the max is 9990. ive gotten @ least 12,000 b4. well DONT BUY IT."
4,Not sure what it does.....,I purchased this toy for my son. I am not sure what it does but he enjoys it and thats the most important thing because that means I got my moneys worth. Any true Yu gi Oh fan is sure to enjoy this toy.
3,...........OK,My litle brother got it yesterday I must say it's better than I thought but it's huge! in the show it's alot smaller and I don't think it's educational at all.
5,Cool!!!!!!!!!,"Hi. I got my Duel Disk on New Year's and I LOVE it! It does almost nothing to your cards, the deck holder holds 60 cards, the Graveyard 20. When I got it, somebody told me I was lucky because they were running out. I'm not surprised, the Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Disk Launcher is so cool! Mattel, thank you for making this awesome toy!!!!!"
5,THIS TOY RULES,WOW THIS TOY REALLY RULES THE FIELD CARD SLOT ARE REALLY COOLTHE GOOD THING THE LP COUNTER CAN SHOW UP TO 9990LPTHE BAD THING THE GRAVEYARD IS TO SMALL AND YOUR CARD CAN BE SERIOUSLY HURT AND TO THE TOP OF IT THE LIGTH IS RED IT IS SUPOSED TO BE WHITE TO BAD I AM NORWEGIEN. THIS TOY IS GREAT
5,Everything else was just practice,"Yah im Justin Bowen and im the runner up at duelist kingdom and we duelsits have something to say. First thing is that we all use the duel disk and we all think the chaos one is way better looking and way cooler than the first. Second if anyone wants to challenge me you will mostly find me battling my other tournament friends in Columbus, Ohio. [...]"
5,know about it now,"I've heard that cards with sleeve(they are these card protecter things from ultra pro)won't fit in the deck zone and it also doesent have a hologrammer thing.But the good part is this very good device can keep track of your lifepoints,ligts go on when you place a card down.But anyway I would recommened to buy it immediately!"
3,"Not bad, almost true to the show, a little bulky though.","I have been a duelist for about a year now and actually I am a judge at my local card shop. I also enjoy watching the show on TV. The look and action of this Duel Disk is exactly as it is on the show. However, you realize how oversized and bulky this thing is when you put it on your wrist. I can only imagine my nephew (who is 8) would be able to keep his arm up with this huge thing. Another thing that could be better is the slots for the cards could have been made a little wider to accomodate card sleeves, which 99% of all duelists use for their cards. Mattel sized the slots exactly to fit the cards with no room left over. What were they thinking?? Any duelist who wanted to get this for fun and use their prized deck in it, forget it. I would never place my most valued cards in this thing without protector sleeves. I still like it though and it is a good piece to show off. I do not think it is really worth the price though."
5,Duel Disk Rocks,"THis is cool because you can now duel like the characters on yugioh. even though there are no hologram projectors, its got cool things like a light up duel counter, and all the slots like the actual tv show. I am excited for this to come out just as i am excited with yugioh the sacred cards."
3,Hold your credit card!,"I think it is a sucsessful idea, but the way it is made needs to be better. First of all the magic/traps are in the front. That means you would have to reach the whole way around to put a m/t card in the slot. Second, it is very and bulky somewhat heavy so you (or your child) would become very tired holding your arm up for the duration of the duel. My suggestion is to wait until they make a better duel disk."
3,Popular toy,My two boys love this toy because they love dueling. The only trouble they have with it is that the snap that holds it in place is not strong. It goes on your wrist but the snap comes off too easily and doesn't stay on the wrist long enough. One of my sons is large and one is smaller in stature- it doesn't matter- the snap still is flimsy. Other than that-they love it.
3,"CHEAP,PAINTED,PLASTIC",mY FRIEND HAD THIS TOY AND i STUDIED IT. IT TURNS OUT YOU STILL HAVE TO HOLD UP EVERY MAGIC AND TRAP CARD YOU PLAY.ONLY GOOD IF YOUR STANDING ON WATER AND CANT PLAY ON TABLE.
5,a yu-gi-oh fanatic,"this a really cool toy. there are only a few cons but otherwise this is a great toy to buy your kid if he likes yu-gi-oh! the cons are the magic/trap cards are in front,no fusion card slots,and it can sort of ruin your cards a little tiny bit. I m the age of 14 and I love the toy. I hope this review was helpful to you"
1,CRAP CRAP CRAPPITY CRAP CRAP!,"Why? WHY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! What is the point of buying this? It costs too much, it's not any fun, I'm sure it puts a strain on your arm, standing there holding your arm out like that... pretending to be Yuugi or Seto. How would I describe this item? LAME! I seriously doubt that the little kids(ages 5-10) that want this, ""Duel-Disk"", even understand the rules of Duel Monsters. I might change my mind about this if at least ONE person can e-mail me and tell me who Ryuji Otogi is!"
2,Duel disk,"The duel disk is a good idea, but not constructed well. You can't put magic, trap, or field cards on it and you can't fit many cards in the deck and graveyard holders. If it was remade with magic/trap card slots and a field zone with larger deck/graveyard holders, it would be worth the money. Don't waste your money on this."
1,hunk of plastic,"this thing is weak. it can't survive a hit with a baseball bat, not a single hit. education and yugioh are 2 words I thought I'd never hear in the same sentance. same with fun"
3,yu-gi-oh,"it's good but a good kick would bad because break, crack and it's gone. $60 bucks is a ripoff, $40 bucks would be better. Don't get it unless your a careful person and at least it's good because you don't have to score on a piece of paper. i'm 12 and no other friends have this dueling disk launcher but everybody has yu-gi-oh cards. i hope this helps. overall though don't get it unless you're a big yu-gi-oh fan."
2,Arrived Broken on one side,This toy arrived broken to my grandson but he waas so happy to have it he didnt care...one side still worked and that was ok with him....
5,Yu-Gi-Oh - DUEL DISK LAUNCHER,"I do not have this Duel Disk but my friend does I did tried it on and it was tight when you get this Duel Disk you can duel in the car right next to your opponent and annonce your move and you can duel up to 9990 LP but no more because the first three buttons goes by the numbers and the fourth is the light, you an duel as many LP as you wish like for example the every first season of Yu-Gi-Oh was 2,000 LP second season was 4,000 LP.And something tells me in the third season of Yu-Gi-Oh their will be with 8,000 LP."
2,"""Guillotine""","I was reading the other reviews, to see if anyone has the same opinion as I do.(YES) I think this thing is cheezy and dangerous!! I am wondering if they are going to recall this thing.However my 9yr old loves it and is getting angry with me for not saying it is wonderful..blah blah blah"
2,WORST TOY EVER,Everyone thinks this thing is fun. But it's just a peice of plastic. and pluthe first day I got it the straps came out of the hole. It deosn't make any sense my arm is as thin as a pencil. and then every time I used itthe straps came back of and anyone that cares about there cards should never touch one of these card destroyers. so I say WORST TOY EVER
2,MUST BUY TODAY!,This thing is awesome! 1 problem: You have to take the cards out of card sleeves!!!! Dagnabit!!!! Who cares... MUST BUY! MUST BUY!!!!!!!
3,"Worth about $10, awful toy for 6 yr old",This toy is basically junk. My son loves dueling and the cards and was so excited. He is even not wanting to use it. Maybe he is too young but I have to say this toy is a disappointment.
5,the best thing ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I think that the duel disk is the best thing inented for yu gi oh!I would recomend this to yu gi oh fans because you can take it almost everywhere.I am the biggest fan in yu gi oh and i recomend it. So the next time you go to toysrus YOU HAVE TO JUST BUY IT!!!!!I gave the darn thing 5 stars for everything!
5,This Rocks!,"(...) This toy Really ROCKS! If you're a true yugioh fan, then you'll want this toy. It doesn't have a hologram projector though. (....unfortunately) Too bad it doesn't come with god cards. This duel disk Has 2 positions-duel and standby-life point counter, card graveyard, card deck holder, magic/trap cards slots, and last but not least, a field card slot. Remember if you want an ultra good toy, For all you true yugioh fans out there, YOU WANT THIS TOY!!!!!!!! :)"
3,NO HOLOGRAMS,"OK kids face it they dont and never will make it so it will have holograms. they just made holograms in the show so it will look cool,and nobody would watch the show if they just played cards down on some table."
3,not really,"i dont recomend u buy this.maybe its just me, but i dont think is does anything but hold ur cards. maybe its because i dont have anyone to play it with but it doesnt seem like fun to me.its just not the toy for me"
1,Snapped in half after 2 months :-(,After 1 month it broke and would not snap back and hold (but he would still play with it) and tonight it snapped in half. He was just dueling with his brother- he always took good care of it. My son is so upset right now and is demanding I get him another. I refuse to drop another $30+ dollars for this trash (but I really wish he could get another - he is just so distressed)
5,Excellent!,I just got this toy today. I found only one flaw:The left magic/trap slot severly damaged my violet crystal magic card. otherwise it worked well. here are good things about this duel disk:1. the magic and trap cards go in the front ( it wouldn't go in the back like the tv show. there isnt enough room)2. it isn't as heavy or bulky as people think.3. there is a field magic card slot resembling the one on the tv show.3. the blade is 2 pieces so you can walk around with it an it wont be in the way.4. it has a life point counter.5. i ripped a kid off and got it for free!
1,The True Review,"I was very excited to buy this toy. I saved my money (a lot of it) and got it. I played with it for the first time and the very last. I'm taking it back to the store. This toy costs too much money for what you get. Save it for something else. Unless you can get it on halfprice clearance sale. Use your very own hands, mat and brain to duel. It is more fun that way and helps you learn. Do not buy this toy. It bends and rips your cards and it's no fun to use the cards you don't really like. Everyone wants to use the best cards. None of my friends have this and it is probably a good thing. Now I won't have it either, but I will buy more cards."
3,holograms where are you,"I am so surprised that it does not have holograms. why don't they? you should try this toy. i don't think the price of this toy is good too expensive, maybe a price of fifteen dollars. this toy is like having a table on your arm. it really doesn't do much. it will become a good toy when it becomes holographic.why doesn't it hold more cards?"
5,Duel Disks Rule!!!!!!!,DUEL DISKS RULE!!!!!! Look kiddies I'm over 12 I'm 14 and believe me the chances of having holograms are slim to none but none the less these are awsome. It's perfect for duelists like me that are serious and wanna have fun when dueling. But none the less THESE ROCK!!!!!!!
2,Dueldisk SUCKS!!!Don't Buy IT!READ MY REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!,THE DUEL DISK LAUNCHER IS GOOD IF YOU HAVE A SMALL DUELING DECK WITH NO CARD CASES AND YOU HAVE A THIN ARM WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS A DUEL DISK. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ITEM IS OVERPRICED FOR IT'SQUALITY. THIS ISN'T SUCH A GREAT ITEM! TRUST ME!!!!!!
5,Great Toy,My 4 year old son loves this toy. He is not sure how or why it works but has not taken it off is arm since he recieved it as an early Christmas gift. It looks like a monstrosity but he finds it quite fun. I believe that this is a great toy for any yu-gi-oh fan.
5,good but not everything,"this duel disk is like the best toy the only bad thing is that it doesnt fit cards with cases and the magic and traps go through the top not the bottom this is still a great toy. the academy duel disk is better cause it does fit cards with cases and the magic and trap cards go through the bottom not top. if you have good cards in cases gat the academy duel disk on www.toywiz.com , but if you have not so good cards get this duel disk. this is a good toy but its not everything"
1,"To all duelists and parents, it's not worth buying...","Kids who are REAL duelists will be very disappointed with this Duel disk system. It does not take into account card sleeves that duelists use to protect their expensive cards like Buster Blader, Mirror Force, etc. It can barely fit 40 cards in the Deck holder and even less in the Graveyard. Even if you don't use card sleeves, both Deck and Graveyard holders warp and even bend the cards. I'm returning mine and getting my money back."
1,This toy stinks (on ice),This toy really really stinks. :-(. It bends the edges of your CARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!! :-)
2,hmmm.... waste of money !,im 15 and i loved yugioh for as long as they came out in japanese and this seemed to be the worst thing they made!!! the duel disk cant even hold cards with sleeves in them !! would u really wanna put ur nice cards in them and the graveyard cant even hold taht many cards u put in around 20 cards and its about full already.... i could probably list atleast 50 thing taht u can actaully make this product better.. 40 bucks i would rather get more cards with taht kind of money then buy this product !!! but hye everybody has a diffrent point of view but i rate this thing 2-3 out of 10 !!!
5,Deceptively Simple,"A beautiful book; enchanting. Even better than Bender's ""Plain and Simple"" (which I also enjoyed). This book reads simply, but the message is profound and multi-layered. Definitely a book to be reflected on. I wish I had friends interested with whom I could talk about the ""every day sacred"" in our lives; Sue Bender's book was a decent substitute until such time as I do!"
5,Everyday sacred,"I read this book a couple of years ago and it really made a positive impact on my life. Sue Bender has a charming style, simple yet profound. After reading the book I created my own bowl, which gave me time to contemplate her book again. I placed the finished bowl on my desk and everday I wrote down, on a slip of paper, what I was grateful for, what brought me joy, and placed the paper in the bowl. At the end of each week I would read my entries and remind myself what I am grateful for and for all the wonderful things I have in my life.I just ordered, on Amazon, ""Plain and Simple"" by the same author and cant wait for it to arrive. I'm sure it will be wonderful as well. The saying ""A book is a garden you carry in your pocket"" applies to all the wonderful books I've surrounded myself with and I love ordering from Amazon."
1,No insights,"This is not an interesting book. Lots of recycled ideas that are pretty obvious -- like the children's book Stone Soup. Also, it takes about 15 minutes to read as the words are so large and the pages so sparse. Not worth the money!"
2,"Enough about the ""bowl""","Save your money. Well written, but lots of white space on the pages, going back and forth about her spiritual friends all over the world (big whoop), and the ""bowl"" - over and over again. I feel like I wasted my money, which I do not have a lot of. I wanted a nice, insighful read, but did not get it. Very little useful thoughts here, unless you like bowls or have envy for jetsetting people who like to talk about their ""wordly"" experiences. Stuff like this is not relevant to ""regular folk""....... moms (married or single), save your money. Keep looking."
1,Everyday Sacred: A Woman's Journey,"I hated this book and regret paying the $11.00 for it. This is a crock of new age zen b.s. and made no sense to me. It was the author's attempt at ""finding"" herself with a group of dis- jointed notes about weird experinces. If you are going to write a book, it should be entertaining or at least understandable."
2,Kathy's Review,I thought I would be able to relate to the author...but I just wanted to finish the book to finish the book! Not impressed.
2,The Cure for the unnamed Problem,"It's a great description of the Spritual Cure.... but we never analyze what was wrong in the first place... it's a type of Narcissism which in her case comes into conflict with her religious values and forced her to develop her spritual walk as a cure.And it's a good cure, often overlooked because we neglect to name the Beast thats at the core.So the spiritual cure goes untried."
2,Too many characters,"I really wanted to like this book, but half way through I found myself just wanting to finish. There were so many characters being developed throughout the novel it became difficult to keep them all straight. At the end, I felt the characters were unable to live up to their development. Great background - poor plot. I will move onto ""The Black Veil"" to give Mr. Moody another shot."
1,"Bad, Very Bad","I made it about half way through this one before i said, ""This is the worst book i have ever read"". (And i have read a bunch of books). I am just sorry there is no rating below one star."
2,A disappointment,"This novel had some terrific moments. However, the book is marginal at best. I found its characters to be caricatures. Worst of all, it is not a page-turner-it is rather dull. I found too many concepts to be cliché. I almost didn't finish it, but I'll stop short of saying I shouldn't have. The novel just didn't do anything, didn't move me. And that's why people read books, isn't it?"
1,Moody BOMBS again with another POORLY-WRITTEN novel,"I never understood what all the hype was about THE ICE STORM, which I also didn't enjoy, but after Dale Peck's wonderful review of Mr. Moody's last book which called Mr. Moody the ""worst writer of his generation"" (Bravo Mr. Peck!), I thought I'd give Mr. Moody another shot by reading his new novel. Here Mr. Moody proves Mr. Peck is correct. It's not as badly written, as it is a bad novel. Also, it is clear from reading this book that Mr. Moody is far more concerned with being a famous writer than being a good one. Sorry, Mr. Moody. I gave you another chance, but you failed again. Go ahead and write the screenplay to this one: I'm sure you already are."
5,Thoughtful and Revealing,"Arctic Crossing is a very thoughtful recording of a challenging personal adventure. I was most struck by the honesty of the author in his observations of himself, the land, and the people who live there. It is not simply an adventure story but addresses important issues of cultural and environmental survival. I am not surprised that it received the Best Book on Adventure Travel from the 2001 Banff Mountain Book Festival!"
3,Lots of traveling,Thank heavens there was a map in the beginning of the book. It certainly helped the reader to keep the journey straight. Lots of information about the natives and their mistreatment by the Canadian government. The descriptions of sights and living conditions were good. I read this for a book group otherwise I never would have picked it up.
5,Move over Farley Mowat!,"Waterman's books, from ""Surviving Denali"", ""High Alaska"", ""Kayaking the Vermillion Sea"", ""A Most Hostile Mountain"", to his current odyssey across the northwest passage ask the reader to dig a little deeper than when reading the typical coffee table adventure. He invites you on a journey to a relatively unknown terrain, provides historical, mythical, & cultural perspective on the Inuit, and then expects you to leverage that knowledge to current environmental and political concerns. His forays into exotic lands and what he finds there, offer a thinking man's approach to this world of wonders. And what I like best is that he does it mostly alone... and there is a moral to the story. Shipman and Shackleton would be smiling in their graves. He'd eat the TV ""Survivors"" yahoos for lunch."
5,Seducing Calculus ;),"Me and Calculus were going through some rough times. When we first went out together, I was intimidated because she was such a complex girl. I tried getting tips and advice from my nerdy friends but even they were unable to comprehend her. Finally I sat and talked with her about our relationship and where it was heading. As my heart approached to negative infinity, her love rose to positive infinity. I was ready to cut her off from my class schedule but than I got this book and since than, me and Calculus have been so happy together. I know how to find her derivatives without having unhooking her equation. I trained her with the chain rule, and now she is my pet. She no longer has power over me. I studied this book,and now she listens to me!! Point is, if you want to make Calculus your b*tch, read up on this manual."
3,A Good Debut,"This album introduces the Minneapolis-based band Mint Condition and once you hear the opening track you know how strongly influenced they were from that area. Although the highly-charged funk numbers would make Prince and The Time nod their heads in approval, the searing slow jams are what really make this album stand out. Breakin My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes) and Forever In Your Eyes might be considered classics several years from now, but for the time being this album provides only a glimpse of what to expect from the band's upcoming LP's. NOT the definitive Mint Condition album, but a good one nonetheless."
2,Pretty AVerage,While Mint Follows The Great Minneapolis Trail here it's Not As Powerful.The Slow Jams Take over more than anything else.Breaking My Heart(Pretty Brown eyes) is in a Class unto itself.They haven't Followed The Minneapolis Sound Up With Strong Grooves here.but you Since this Group will be Around.it's a Average Start but they have Promise.
5,PRETTYYYYYYY BROWNS EYES :),"Im charlotte.!!! Awwwwwwwwwww i LOVE these songs....IT REMINDS ME of me & MY boyfriend Lewis and 'forever in your eyes'....reminds me when we 1st met christmas time. We kinda braking up at the mo though....but these two songs sends me back to ma much happier memorys of him. I still love him and i always will, it brings tears to ma eyes. But hey..This is a must buy album and anyone who is in love must have this album..."
4,How it all got started,This is Mint Condiion from the beginning! Great job for a debut album! This is one CD that should be added to your collection!
3,A plus for beginning Reefers,"Dr. Herbert Axelrod continues to pass on his aquatic prowess in this book for coral enthusiasts. Novice reefkeepers should definitely invest in this book as it is very easy to read and understand. Experienced reefkeepers would even profit from having this book in their aquatic library for reference at any time, as it is thorough in all the typically kept hard and soft corals. Each coral is given its own color-coded review for difficulty of keeping and put into one of three catagories, green for beginners, yellow for experienced keepers of corals, and red for those who consider themselves experts. On the whole this is a great reference for anyone who is considering keeping corals, either for the first time or continuing to keep them after years of experience."
4,"A great whole album to listen to. Great vocals, good tunes.","This album covers a variety of styles in the folk-rock umbrella. Although Dave is from Britian, some songs have more of an Americana or country rock feel. But he also has a few haunting and beautiful ballads. What stood out to me was his songwriting ability. These stories are well told. Whether he's singing about a friend's infidelity or ""mistakenly"" walking into a strip club, his style is unique. A feel-good album."
5,Let's Have a Miniature Secret Black Celebration,"This is an excellent CD. Picture Depeche Mode with Peter Murphy on lead vocals. Admittedly, my introduction to this group was hearing ""Once in a Lifetime"" at a club off their most recent album. POPKILLER was the only one I could find. Even here in NYC, I only found one record store, Generation Records that had any of their CDs. The music is reminiscent of Murphy's early work on ""If the World Should Fail to Fall Apart"" and ""Love Hysteria."" They also have Depeche Mode's penchant for disturbing lyrics set to a dark but sometimes playful synthpop style. They've been around for a while but I think they're only just coming into their own and may be a force to reckon with in the first decade of the year 2000."
4,Excelent synth-pop music,"This is a good synth-pop album. The overall style is not really ""modern"" (another bands like Alphaville and Depeche Mode had almost same kind of music at their begining), but as I can see, their music style is very, very distinctive from any other band, specially for the leading vocal. My favorite song is ""Tender days""."
3,good read but no blockbuster,"I found the book interesting and it kept my attention however, it's not one of those books that you'll want to read again or that is memorable. The character development was weak and the ending was predictable."
3,Not everything can be above average.,"This is an okay read. The characters are of some intrerest but not particularly well developed or realistic. The plot would probably work better if it were more deftly handled. The writing is functional but in no way clever or inspiring. It just gets the job done. On the other hand, there are not a lot of typos or grammatical goofs to distract. So this is about an average novel, maybe toward the high end of average. If you just can't find anything better, give it a read."
4,Decent CD,"I found the atmosphere relaxing and something natural about Maral's style that wasn't overdone with effects. I also liked her flows though I was looking for something a little more vinyasa or ashtanga -- it was slower than my usual styles. I also find one hour a bit long for something that slow. Perhaps better for someone more beginner than I.Slight mixmatched moments in the video. Nothing to worry about, but I did notice it.Sound track was decent and location was good. The menu was decent too.Again, I'd use it more often if the pace were a bit faster."
5,Impressive Yoga DVD for beginner and not-so beginner yogis,"This DVD is very interestingly produced: there are two instruction types available for the sequences and poses, one very detailed, and another with less instructions. It is well-chaptered, with all the routine times indicated on the chapter menu, so this allows you to easily choose the routines you want to follow during your session. The different moves are well explained and executed. The shooting location is just wonderful and works well with Maral's very soothing voice. All in all, I liked the DVD very much, and think this is a great addition to anyone willing to get or improve their yoga technique."
2,Not really for beginners & not easy to follow,"Thank goodness I ordered two begginer DVD's and actually liked one of them. The menu for this DVD is hard to understand and the series' are very hard to follow. They are all taped at different locations, etc and then all thrown together. One 75 minute session jumps from the woods to the beach with no transition from the instructor. She also doesn't give any modifications for harder poses or any encouragement along the way. Most of the DVD is set in the wilderness, while it's a nice setting, the constant bird chirping and bugs making noises is less than ideal for me while doing something new and challenging. I hate to complain, but these are my honest thoughts, I will more than likely be giving this DVD away and never popping it in again...."
5,Very rugged chew toy,"Our French Bulldog, Dweezil, is very tough on chew toys but this one has held up and is still in very good condition!"
2,Pieces torn off,"My dog started chewing large chunks off this within an hour, and it only lasted for a few days until I had to throw it away. He also tore off most of the nubs immediately. I'm still finding little blue nubs he didn't swallow all over the place. Definitely not the toy for aggressive chewers."
4,Pups love it,We have a 6 month and a 12 month and they both LOVE this thing. I wish I could buy a multipack of them.
2,Not for strong chewers,I have a Catahoula and an Australian Shepard. The Catahoula started chewing this apart within the minute I gave it to him. Not for powerful chewers.
1,Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.,"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog."
1,Don't waste your money,My 10 lb. min pin shredded this thing in under an hour. This is of terrible quality and breaks into small pieces the dog will swallow.
5,My dog loved it.,This is much softer then a regular Nylabone. My cocker spaniel loved it and consumed it in 2 days. Don't expect this to last like a regular Nylabone.
4,solid,"The dogs love this chew. However, it is not good for tug games (my puppy loves tug) because the little nubs that are good for their teeth are not good for my hands. :)"
3,Not for Big Chewers,This toy would be great for a small puppy or dog that likes to chew. But its really gummy and wont last very long for the normal big chewers. One of my older pit mixes literally ate this toy in minutes and shes only 55lbs. The toy was meant for the chihuaha in the bunch but was taken from him and eaten.
4,Puppies enjoy it,"I got it and my puppies took to it right away. They've been going back to it for the past week, so I think they like it!"
5,Great Product,"Our french bulldog Zoe loves these things. She likes the little plastic nubs and she'll chew them down until the ends are pretty much unrecognizable. Our vet is constantly amazed by the health of her teeth and gums, so I would say these things work. The only downside is that they don't last very long for aggressive chewers, and occasionally you have to rinse them off as slobber and the like will get in between the nubs and get it kind of gross."
1,no interest,"No matter how often I put this away and reintroduced it, my pup was simply NOT interested. I bought it thinking it would be ideal for teething - but not for us."
2,My dog has super powers or...,"My dog has super powers or this is not a very sturdy product. I don't have rotts or dobies or pittbulls, I have a 50 pound golden retreiver that broke this in half within 10 minutes of chewing on it. Although he did seem to enjoy it before it broke."
4,"Great Product, Although Not Our Dog's Favorite","Sadie, the Wonder Dog, our (approximately) seven year-old golden retriever was not especially fond of these (although like all dogs that I know, she loves to chew). We surmised it might be the plastic-like texture. (Sadie's not generally very choosy about what she puts in her mouth, she'll eat tofu, broccoli, eggs, bok choy--almost anything.)This is a very good product, and is recommended in many of the books we've read however, if this is your dog's first time with the Nylabone, you might want to try one out before ordering a lot of them. If this isn't the one for your dog, talk to your vet about alternative chews similar to the Nylabon: They're safer than the real thing, and are very good for your dog's dental health."
4,Can be messy,the litte 'nubs' on this particular nylabone will be all over your house. My dogs seemed to like it though.
1,Shame on this company!,"Do not do business with this company!This is a good product, my dog already has one and I wanted to order many more to have on hand.This company was running a good sale so I chose them to give my business.At $3.99 per chew, I wanted to order six. The pretotal was to be $8.52. Shipping and handling was (gird your loins) $29.94, for a grand total of the original price of $8.52 order to total, including tax $38.46.Shame on this company! This company represents greed at it's finest!I placed this same order online with Petsmart and my total order total, including tax and shipping came to $20.31 - a difference in price of $18.15For petite dog dental chews!Thus, my advice is to order this product from Petsmart."
2,bargain Mozart,Really a very good price for 4 operas of Mozart.So dont be surprised if you seen better performances.But close your eyes and enjoy the music.
1,A Release,"In response to the question in T.J.Murphy's review , this indeed seams identical to the earlier box set release. Since NONE of the performances are the best available and some are really bad--in both my opinion and that of those who reviewed the individual dvds, a price reduction was probably necessary."
2,Is This Different???,"Does anyone know if this collection is different from the much more expensive ""Mozart - The Salzburg Festspiele Opera Boxset"" (ASIN B000I80FKU) (also titled M/22) available here on Amazon for $485.99?"
1,What's going on?,"When I placed this order the description says ""in stock"". Now Amazon notified me that they are trying to obtain it. What's going on here?"
5,Love the whole set!,"My husband bought me these for Christmas and I love them. The cups are thick.. feel like a restaurant cups, and the tree is very decorative. I love the way they look and feel. We use them every single morning for our coffee."
3,This is a children's book,I was looking for information on Cornish Rex cats as I have two of them. It was not obvious from the description that this is a children's oriented book.
5,But what's the error?,Very tantalizing to say there's only one error (to the reviewer's knowledge) and then not disclose it. It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness.
2,"Poorly done, but nice photographs.","Although Bartlett and Bartlett have published some decent books on reptiles and amphibians, I find several of them seem rushed, and full of errors. Designer Reptiles and Amphibians is one of these.The book contains a panoply of errors, such as poorly used examples and mislabelled photos. The accurate parts of the text are decently written, but if you are not already familiar with genetics and the species you're reading about, the mistakes may be hard to catch.All in all, this book is a waste of money unless you want some nice pictures of some attractive colour morphs."
4,Price+Features=Great Camcorder,"I'll be honest and admit that if you want to spend a thousand dollars on a camcorder than you will definitely find something better. However, if you are somebody like me who had limited funds to spend but wanted all the everyday features a ... person would want, then this is the camera to buy! All the basics are included (still photo shots, fantastic zoom abilities, picture stabilization, ability to film in complete darkness and amateur picture manipulation capabilities).It also hooks up to a PC using a fire wire cable (IEEE1394) and a video capture board, which I recommend buying the StudioDV from Pinnacle Systems that includes both for ... then getting sucked for ... by purchasing Sony's brand. Also I found the Laser Link feature to be the best features, allowing me to play back my tapes on the TV without having to hook up the camera to it every time.Overall, the DCR-TRV130 is a great camera for what you're going to spend on it."
5,Excellent basic camcorder,"I've bought my camcorder about a month ago and find it to be a dream. This is an upgrade of my 5 year old Sony camcorder and it has all the useful features that you would expect. It also includes a Lithium battery, a built-in light and a night-viewing system that allows you to shoot in total darkness.I would fully recommend this to anyone looking at camcorders."
4,it is - what it is,I found the book informative. Nice commentary - wonderful photos. - done with a broad spectrum of readers in mind.
2,Nice pictures same old information,"I got this book as a gift and tried to find something new that isn't just rehashed stuff of legends.I'll condense this book into the following; Hemi,LS-6,Stage III,Super Duty,Cobra Jet,440 Magnum,427 Wedge Ram Air IV and W-30 - all good, all the rest were not quite up to the task.Of course if you had a drivers licence during that heydey and actually street raced you knew better, most people could not afford those expensive stuff-of legend cars and actually made runners out of the 400 inch and below motors from all the different manufacturers. Those were really the musclecars that were out there in numbers, a poorly tuned Hemi could'nt beat a well tuned 327 or 289 and that was often the case on the street.But hey the photos are pretty good, and if you haven't heard the stories and legends ad naseum - this book is for you."
5,Motor City Muscle:The HIgh-Powered History of the American Musclecar,"Great little book(the 2011 Edition w/a cool Orange Camaro Illustration on the Cover), Everything in the book is covered from Chevelles to Camaros To Firebirds,GTOS,Buick GS/GSX,and 4-4-2,It's A Reader,yes there is alot of Color Pictures some small ads but it is mainly a Reader with funny writing and well deserved nader-bashing,there is even a Mention of The Corvette(Why it's not a Muscle Car, I think the High performance and the new Ones Are).Great Book!"
5,If you buy only one dance CD this year this should be it!,"This CD is what I listen to when I have had a bad day and I need a lift. It gets my feet moving and will always get me out of any funk I happen to be in. This CD is essential for any house party if you want people to have a great time and dance. The mixing is flawless and the combination of songs is perfect, that is if you like to get your groove on. Remember you have to LET YOUR JOY RISE!"
5,Very good book,This book covers your basic design planning as well as advanced three tier support. I particularly liked the section on architecting the application to run in two tier and back to three tier with a simple change in the config file. This book also takes into consideration the variety of databases out there and attempts to support them all. This is a very good book...
1,No low profile mounting included.,Returned it to Amazon with no problems. Have a low profile HP system and could not install it because no low profile was included. They should state that there is no low profile bracket included.
5,Works perfectly.,"Just make sure this is the right card for your PC. If you still have the original HP Compaq drivers on your hard drive, it will see this card, and with one reboot, you now have a DVI out along with the VGA on the motherboard."
1,"Shameful quality, don't be tricked",This thing is a joke. I just received it in the mail and tried it out. The cape is literally trashbag plastic with a string on it. The scissors feel like they are disposable. The mirror is for dolls. The accessories obviously were made by the lowest bidder. I have owned two Wahl products in the past and felt happy with previous purchases. I will no longer buy Wahl products without trialing them first.My favorite part was that they tried wave the Made in America flag. Most of the funk was made in China and assembled in US (just put in the box?). Wow. 100% pure funk.Strangest of all was that I looked at the ratings on Amazon. and showed that they were solid. Must have a bunch of folks overseas contracted with Wahl to write stuff.I think Amazon should stop selling this product. Perhaps a better marker of buyer satisfaction is how often folks send an item back. I am sending mine back today...they day I got it.
2,deluxe chrome pro,the clippers are average the trimmers are pure garbage they dont cut anything and you need a battery for them not a good product i been cutting hair for 15 years the quality is poor you can go to any store and get this quality
4,Wahl Hair Clipper,I have used this product twice since purchasing and it works well. The many attachments make the job easy and comfortable. I would recommend the Wahl as a good value product.
4,no complaints,bought this set for my daddy and he's funny about a lot of things but this one in particular i got no complaints which is a breath of fresh air coming from him. it was part of his christmas gift and he appreciated this more than anything and what he doesnt kno is that it was the cheaper of them all. not only that but i had broken his clippers before giving someone a hair cut so it was well needed and i couldnt have picked a better brand because his old clippers was also Wahl but he had them for over 25 years.
4,great cut,We have had this product about a month and made two or three cuts. It seems to work great and be a product worth getting to save money on haircuts in these tough economic times
3,not quite up to wahl standards,blades were not properly aligned upon first use. the side blade adjustment did not work properly. i've used wahl clippers for many years and this one is one of the worst. my favorite clipper was the multi-colored one that had a different color for each clip size. never used the included trimmer.
2,DEAFENINGLY LOUD clippers,"I've been cutting my own hair for the past 3 years and finally decided to get a new set of clippers. These clippers are fantastic. They cut well come with a bunch of accessories. What's not to love? Well, there is one thing... these clippers are incredibly LOUD. I feel as if I might go deaf in one ear if I'm cutting too close to it. It's not just annoyingly loud, I feel like if you really sat there using them for the entire duration of a haircut, it would be bad for your hearing."
1,Absolutely terrible product,"I first got this clipper a few months ago from amazon. It worked great the first time, but the second time I tried to use it, it made a terribly loud noise, really rendering it unusable. I went for a few months without a clipper before getting one at Target yesterday. But I accidentally got the same make and model, and guess the results? Even worse! I turned it on, and after a few short seconds, the clipper made that same terrible noise and then actually sputtered out and died. I'm returning it tomorrow.Don't get this clipper!"
4,Good clipper,I bought this product to cut my son's hair. The first time I used it my son complained saying that it was pulling his hair. I didn't know what was wrong so I went to read the instructions. I noticed that the clipper blades were not aligned like the one in the picture. I fixed it and after that my son did not complain anymore. I think the clipper does an okay cutting.
4,Great Deal for the Money,"I bought this clipper after seeing that it got great reviews, and had an instant $10 off coupon attached to it. I really like the portable trimmer for my neck and sideburns, and the main clipper has all of the pieces that you could ever need.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars - I had to return the first one, because it got rust on the main clipper. I didn't run it over any water, but I did use the oil that was included but not a lot. Amazon was great with the return, and I'm very happy with my new one."
1,crap,I used this product about 30 times to cut hair.It broke about a month ago. I used once or twice a month at most.
5,"Two years, going strong.","I mow my hair with this thing once every two weeks and it's still going strong. Couldn't be easier. The ONLY complaints I have is that the included mirror is a bit cheap, and the switch on the hair trimmer is a bit glitchy and it'll cut off if you bump it while in use. Those are the accessories though, and you shouldn't even need the mirror for your standard crew cut. The clipper itself justifies the thirty-three bucks I paid... Of course, I see the price is a bit higher now... But for what I paid, it's 5/5 stars."
4,Paid for itself in just 2 haircuts!,"What a great product, and great price. I bought this one due to the reviews, and am glad I did. These clippers are great, they work great, are easy to use, and comes with a handy pouch to put it all in. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is hard to read the size number, but other than that, I'm very happy with this product.Even if it only lasts for a few more haircuts (I hope it lasts longer than that), it has already paid for itself three times over, and the best part... I don't have to leave a tip!"
4,Great clipper,I purchased this for my husband and he loves it!!! He has already used it and this will save us money down the road since he can cut his own hair.
5,Cutting hair made easy,This product and the instructions are everything Wahl claims. I say this is a definite buy.
4,Nice clippers!,"We have been very pleased indeed. I say we, because I cut my husband's, as well as my 3 son's hair with these things. I get done so much quicker than with my old set, and it doesn't jerk their hair because it can't handle the job, like my old clippers did. Now, my guys line up happily, to get their relaxing haircut. I would definitely recommend that people continue to purchase these. Wahl has really come thru. I would like a roomier container with hard sides but, all in all, I am very pleased."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I bought these clippers about 4 months ago and I have probably cut my hair with them about 6 or 7 times. After this period of time, they immediately went bad or dull and it kept snagging my hair (I normally have short hair). They were abnormally loud and my wife was warning me not to use them. Not listening to my better half, I used the clippers, I had to torture myself by finish up and it was very painful. Afterwards, I immediately threw those clippers away and I would never buy Wahl products again. A complete waste of money!"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,It's very noisy and as a brand new product it's not as sharp as it should be so who knows how it becomes after some usage.
4,Alright,it's alright. It feels good in the hand. The blades it comes with don't get as close of a cut as others I have had. My kid dropped it on the tile floor and there was no damage.
3,"Gets the job done, but not perfect","I bought this set as part of a promotion with a mail-in-rebate, and for the price I paid, It was a good deal. The clippers work pretty well, however often start to make a VERY loud buzzing noise while in use; this is resolved by applying pressure to the metal plate (annoying). As for the included trimmer - might as well throw it away. Even with brand new batteries, the thing lacks power to reliably cut hair without pulling."
2,"STarted off great, but failed in the end","I use my clippers to give myself a buzz cut once or twice a week. The battery powered trimmer never worked, but the actual clippers were great...for about a year. Not all the attachments fit correctly, but that didn't matter because I didn't use any. After about a year, the power switch became difficult to switch to on, and would not stay running unless you were holding the switch a certain way. Now I am unable to return or exchange and have clippers that are useless. I have recently read other reviews where the customer had the exact same problem, but a lot sooner than I did."
5,Great Product!,"I am a huge fan of Wahl hair clippers and this one did not let me down as usual. Sleek look, many attachments, and an absolute steal for the price! HIGHLY recommend this product."
2,Good while it lasted...,"It cuts hair pretty well and feels nice and solid. However, I only had this product for about 10 months and then it broke. After 8 haircuts it died when I flipped it on for the 9th and will no longer turn on. In order to get a repair/replacement I need to prepay postage and send it in to Wahl on good faith that they will return it without charge. It feels kind of silly to pay almost $10 for a chance to get it fixed or replaced when I purchased it for $38."
5,Good quality items!,"I use this a couple times a year to cut my own hair, and it all works fine and is made of good quality. I've had cheaper sets before, but this one is with the extra 10-15 dollars. Very nice! The small trimmer is, however, very, very loud, but everything else is fine."
4,Nice present.,"Does a great job. Quiet---with a nice low hum. Got it for Christmas, and very happy I don't have to return it."
4,Works great...saves money!,"We've been using this for more than a year to give home haircut and simply love it! It's easy to use, has a lot of accessories for different hair cutting options, and has proven to be very durable. Highly recommended."
5,Great product - great Amazon service,"I was looking for something with which I could cut my own hair, and this fit the bill perfectly. The small trimmer is a great addition, and the attachments are super useful. The nylon bag is a little flimsy, but it doesn't diminish the overall value of this product."
4,Clippers as described do a good job.,"This Wahl Clipper set is a good product for the money. I have been using Wahl for many years and they make a great product. I will continue to use Wahl products in the future. This set was well worth it. It arrived to my house 3 days earlier than originally stated. Product was packed well and shipped properly. Comes with a lot of attachments and extras. Although the mini clipper did not meet my expectations, I still like this clipper set. I do wish the clipper set came in a hard shell case as opposed to a fabric one. But, I thankfully saved the old hard shell case from my old Wahl clipper set and the new one fits in there real nice. And another nice little tid-bit...the attachments from my old Wahl clipper set fits this NEW Wahl clipper set with no problems."
3,Wahl clippers,"The small trimmer should have come with a battery. Both the clippers seem to be well made. As for the rest of the items, I found they were quite cheap and could have been left out of the package. the cape looked like a kitchen garbage bag and we are not sure that the scissors would have cut paper. but for the price the clippers were worth it."
3,Decent value but...,I have been buzz cutting my own hair for years now and my old Wahl was a true champ. I decided to retire it and bought this one... Meh. It is decent looking and comfortable in the hand but the bottom line is that it misses hairs regularly. Sometimes I catch them right away and for others 2 or 3 days later I will be brushing my teeth and notice a single hair sticking out twice as long as all the others. Is it annoying enough to replace it? Nah. Would I do it again? Nah.
1,Fell apart after first use...........,"I'm not really good at writing reviews,so I'm going to keep it short.. First i take the trimmer out of the plastic bag,i put in a battery.. so far so good.. Oh wait.. 20 sec later it stops working note that the batteries were brand new so there's no way that could be the problem,the trimmer just simply stopped working ,no power at all.so i say to myself ugh well at least i have the clippers right?WRONG,i began using the clippers and this time 4 minutes later the blade falls apart.a screw driver took care of it the first time but then it continues to fall apart...even after adjusting the power to it's lowest setting, i don't know but it looks like im going to need a power drill to keep this thing together. anyways overall it wasn't worth the nearly 50$ in my case(so much for keeping it short) But beware of this product.It's better to be safe then sorry i guess"
2,"Useless clipper, but the trimmer was quite good","The clipper that came in this set were useless. After just one use, it stopped working.The trimmer however was quite good. I have been using it for a few months now and has worked quite well."
2,Not For Everyone,"Heavy weight unlikely to be suitable for many. Low rating based on the uncomfortably loud noise generated by this trimmer. Unclear whether this is a design fault or it arrived with a mechanical fault. Caveat emptor. Another Wahl trimmer, purchased in Japan, works well and is silent by comparison."
3,Not worth the money,Spend a few more bucks and get a better model without a cordless trimmer. I received mine and the trimmer doesn't even work. The worst part is I didn't find out until months later because I rarely use a trimmer.Thank God I was able to borrow one from another stylist or my guest would have gotten a free haircut and looked like they didn't even get one.
5,Love Love LOVE this product!,"I've been using a discount store set of clippers that I paid $12 for to cut my husband's hair for the last couple of years, so I am definitely no professional in critiquing clippers. But I used this tonight (after properly oiling the blades) and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! In one easy stroke, all the hair pieces were cleanly sliced off, as opposed to my previous clippers that took 4 or 5 strokes. It's powerful and heavy duty. There are more than enough clippers attachments, and the scissors were even super sharp and useful. I can't get over how inexpensive this investment was for such a great product. Thank you again Amazon!"
4,Shipment Delay,Trimmer is excellent for cutting the sideburns. Overall im very satisfied and would buy it again in case if the shipment would be done on time. Amazon delayed with shipment for like 5 days. The rest is even cheaper than anywhere else for me when i saw the prices. Shopping is good if the shipment would be on time.
2,Defective item,"this clipper was missing the two screws which hold it together, and therefore the back of the clipper came right off, revealing the wires inside. I have not yet contacted the manufacturer, so I do not know how their service is. In addition, despite the clippers being labeled ""chrome"" they are made out of plastic, something that becomes evident when they come apart... which is why they really should have included the screws"
1,Refurbished & used item shipped,I was a shipped a used item initially. I returned it and requested another one.Again got shipped a refurbished item with mirror broken and scratches on the clipper.Wahl is just pushing their returned goods through Amazon.Amazon services are excellent and probably are not even aware of the contents Wahl is shipping to customers.
4,Clippers are quality; trimmer is not,"The large clippers are quality and have operated very well for many months so far. They are well balanced, have plenty of power, and all the attachments you would need.The nose/ear hair trimmer works reasonably well. The light is not helpful at all and not really needed. Battery life is fine.The hair trimmer was very cheap and stopped working within a couple months. It's kind of a throwaway item and should not play into whether you buy this system or not."
4,Gets the job done,All I require is a simple 3 all around so for that purpose it is great! I did notice however that the main cutter piece does get significantly hot. The blade also isn't as sharp as I would like so some hairs tend to be stubborn.. Not bad for the deal I got though and works for my needs
3,It works but is unrefined.,"I was looking for a hair trimmer made by Apple, what I bought was this. The grip is comfortable but the trimmer is large, heavy and cumbersome. The vibration is pronounced when operating. The on-off switch is coarse to operate and too small. The small battery powered trimmer is a nice accessory but it feels like it came from the dollar store and it speeds up and slows down with a mind of its own (with new batteries). The soft case is large and holds all of the accessories. Their are several differnt size cutters to accomodate most needs. If you drive a Dodge Ram, this is your clipper. If you prefer the Honda Ridgeline, looks somewhere else. Though it functions as promised, it feels as though the design has not been refined since the 70's. I would not buy this trimmer again."
1,Aweful Company,I bought this product and 4 days later I was given an email saying it was backordered and the site should not have had the clippers up for sale on amazon. I went back to the site days later and it was still up there for sale not saying anything about the backorder. They need to stay on top of what they have posted and fix it instead of making me wait days before saying they could not get the product for me
1,it is just garbage,I ordered this thing from the amazon.Please dont sell this product no more.It does'not even work.When I see it and i felt like stupid.
4,Great starter kit,"I purchased this kit for my niece, ... who is intersted in cosmetology. This kit gives her a number of tools that as she learns more, can upgrade each device piece by piece. This is a great starter kit."
5,Great product,"This is a great, quality product. I bought it as a gift for my dad who is a hairy guy. He uses it to trim his head and back hair, and it has worked well for him."
5,as expected,"after reading the reviews, I gained the confidence in purchasing the trimmer and I am fully satisfied with its performance though I had used it once so far. But the first impression is the last impression, I believe."
4,Pretty Good...for the price,"We purchased these clippers for my husband. He uses them mainly to shave his head (no comb-overs anymore). Thus far it's doing a good job and is fairly quiet and easy to use. The extra guides that come with it aren't too practical, although there are plenty of them if you prefer to use them, we find they clog too easily.His last set of Wahl clippers are still going strong after many years but Hubby decided he didn't want to share clippers with our Schnauzer anymore so now he's got his own."
2,"Works well, just very LOUD","The product arrived as advertised and everything worked. This would be an excellent value except it will get very loud all of a sudden while trying to cut hair. It is so loud that I refuse to use it anymore and will buy another brand. I bought a cheapo brand approx 15 years and it worked great all those years. I've used this one 3 times and I'm fed up with it. Believe me, move on to another clipper!"
1,Low Quality Returned,"Large clippers heavy and cumbersome to use. Attachments for large clippers cheap, flimsy and don't stay attached. Small clippers eats batteries like 1st wife ate bon-bons. Surprised Wahl would put their name on this junk. I'll be going back to Remington products."
4,Wahl 79524 w trimmer,"Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper & Trimmer, 27 PiecesHigh quality product. Works very well. It's versatile and easy to handle. Now I'm going to get my haircut at home and avoid the time and cost of going to the barber. Would like to have the battery powered trimmer slightly larger powered by a C or D cell battery."
5,Great Clipper,"I had a $10 Vidal Sassoon Clipper which was plain painful to use, used to tangle my hair, wasn't sharp enough, used to make a mess and would take forever to cut hair. This Wahl is everything that Vidal Sassoon wasn't. I bought this after much research and almost to point of resigning myself to getting my hair cut by a stylist.In short, the cutting surface is sharp and powerful, like the ones used in salons (I used to wonder how is it that the stylists clippers cut so effortlessly compared to mine) and in my case just 1 pass of this clipper was enough to cut it to the level I want. What used to take 1 hour to cut now takes only about 10 minutes, and I was able to do it on my own! It has many attachments and extras which may or may not useful but the clipper itself is a gem -- powerful and painless."
2,Buyer beware,"These clippers did not make it through one hair cut. We obviously were given a bad set because the actual clippers literally fell apart in my wife's hands as she was cutting my hand. The casing around the clippers came off as she was trimming exposing all of the interal wires. We were able to finish the cut (very carefully without electricuting either of us) before we sent the clippers back that day. These clippers got a high review from other purchases, that's why we bought them, but it obviously didn't work out for us. They did cut very smooth when it was working. Also, my wife complained about them vibrating so much it put her arm to sleep. Two stars for the smooth cut."
2,Defective,"This machine lost power a month, I was not satisfied with the purchase that is why people will have confidence to shop online"
2,Not what I expected from a Whal product,"Not at all what I expected, bought this item for my grandaughter (she's a haidresser) and she could not use the clipper, it pulled the hair so bad, thankfully she was able to use the other parts. Would not recomended"
1,Disappointed,"These clippers simply just do not cut close enough for me, and they also appear to be cheaply made. I wish I never wasted my money on this cheap bundle. Next time I'll spend a few extra bucks and buy a professional model, something similar to what the barbers cut hair with."
4,Does the job,"Good for buzzing your own melon. It seems like the #2 is a little long though, so dropped to a one. That was my only small issue. Other than that it has done the job. I should note that I do no blending, fading, or tapering. So I can't really speak to that."
4,Good customer service from Wahl,"Got my kit and used it once. Works well.There were two missing pieces in the kit. I called Wahl, and they sent the pieces to me right away."
2,Got what I paid for,"This was a replacement for a Conair that was about 15 years old. Price was a factor in the purchase. I tried to get a nice package of product for the best price. I got my money worth but the quality of the clippers is less than my Conair. It cuts nice but the adjustment on the side has no ""stops"" so I can never get it in the same place once moved. The plastic guards are cheaply made with flimsy plastic. Thankfully my Conair guards fit this one. I would not recommend this product to anyone. On the bright side, Amazon was fast shipping!"
4,Tight Wad Trimmer,"Wahl makes it easy to ""do it yourself"". I have successfully given myself a few haircuts, and am pleased with how easy it is to add on an attachments, and get great results. I feel like I am cheating on my barber, but Wayl makes this so easy. The guys at work have joked about starting men's night, so we can sit in the garage, drink beverages, and commence with the trimming. There are a few of us who have become basement barbers, so why not make it an event. With the attachments, I won't even mind if Mike has a few too many before grabbing the trimmer. It is that easy."
2,Not like the older models!!!!!!!,"Does not cut as well. We had to go over the same area several times for all the hair to get cut. Does not stand up a a cheaper, slightly older model we got just a few years before."
2,Don't need the rest,"The clippers seemed fine but the rest of this kit: scissors, cape, etc.. is CHEAP. The cape ripped the first time I used it and the scissors stuck together as I used them. You are better off buying the clippers and then finding the rest some where else."
1,"Poor design, power switch fails after limited use","I've noticed other customers reporting the same issue, the power switch starts to fail (and eventually completely breaks) after limited use.I expect I got around 6-7 sessions out of this before the switch started to fail. 10-11 uses later and it's nearly impossible to turn on."
2,Very cheaply made product,i have owned Wahl clippers and trimmer/liners before and this is just not up to their usual standards. i think this is a cheaply made bundle to cash in on the bargain consumer rather than a good set for a great deal.the plastic pieces to adjust the length were mostly bent out of shape right out of the box. the clippers don't cut anywhere near as well as my previous Wahl clippers. same thing with the trimmer. as a matter of fact the trimmer is so small it makes it mistake prone when trimming around the neck and side burn areas.i'm disappointed that i went for a cheap bundle when i should've bout a quality set like the one i had before.
3,Not very impressed,All the items appeared and felt cheap. I bought a better one in Walmart for $14.99with out all the other useless 27 pieces.
4,"Good price, but not Chrome","Decent product. Comes with a nice zip case, and pretty much everything you'd need to give a haircut. The barber's cape was kind of a joke--it was cheap plastic garbage bag quality, so I ended up throwing it out after the first use. Zip case is nice to store all the parts.My main criticism of this product is that it is called ""Chrome Pro"" yet, it contains no chrome whatsoever. Don't call it chrome if it's not actually chrome. The shiny parts of the clippers that look like crome are cheap plastic.Overall, a good deal for your money. Cheaper than going to the barber at $16/cut!"
2,Wahl clippers,The only problem with these is that when I went to cut my son's hair along his neck line it actually cut his skin and caused him to bleed. I have to use the small trimmer for finishing touches. Also it appears that the blade is crooked. I will probably remove the two large screws and see if there is any way to straighten them out rather than deal with the huge headache of trying to return the thing.
1,Junk clippers! Don't waste your money!,I have purchased two sets of these. I thought that perhaps the first set was defective and I had gone past the warranty time. Based on a price I bought a second set. Let me tell you the many clippers that a battery-operated junk. Once you take them apart to clean them they do not go back together again successfully. Customer service that Whal is nonexistent. These are cheap imported crap!!! Don't waste your money.
2,comes with no screws,"i bought this crap from amazon and it came with no screws holding the clipper housing together . how is that even possible ? it's still usable but the housing will come apart if you dont hold it right, that's a hassle while cutting hair. i contacted amazon about it and they did nothing. piece of crap."
4,Wahl Hair Clipper set,"The Wahl Clipper we ordered came in a very timely manner. It was everything we wanted and are pleased with the quality, cost, and the number of attachments that are part of the set. Thank you."
3,27 piece wahl trimmer set,"The price was good, for what all you get with this set. The only bad thing was that I received 2 around the ear trimmer attachments that were identical, and no eyebrow trimmer attachment. That makes me wonder who puts these sets together, and what else I will find not working or misplaced, as I use the set more."
2,Noise & poor life span,"I used this to cut my husband's hair. After 1 haircut the smaller trimmer no longer worked, & after the second the main clipper/cutting device began making a very loud buzzing noise. I literally won't cut my husband's hair without us both wearing ear plugs as it is as loud as our lawn mower! On the other hand, the main clipper still cuts hair well & we have enjoyed the multiple attachments for different lengths. I'm looking into buying my husband a new set, because the noise & lack of trimmer are too annoying & inconvenient."
5,Seems great after 2 haircuts,"I never used a clipper to cut my own hair before but it seems to work great, I do wish they had one more attachment for very short hair. Otherwise 3 uses and it pays for itself."
5,Great Shaver,This product is what I was looking for. It is hard to find a clipper that is good enough to shave your head. This works perfect and comes with a smaller clipper which is great for getting your ears and touch ups on your head.
1,"Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper & Trimmer, 27 pieces","I love the Multi-Cut Clipper, but the trimmer never worked which was really disappointing because trimming is an intrical part to giving a good hair cut. I requested a replacement for the trimmer, but was told I would have to mail and return the entire kit which was really most inconvenient. They didn't offer me any other options, and I need the clipper and attachments weekly, so the returning and waiting for a new kit to be sent was not something I could do. I would have to say that I'm NOT satisfied with this purchase and will not buy from them again. Further, this is the first time I've ordered anything from Amazon that didn't work or arrived damaged. Makes me a little reluctant to order from Amazon again. Wish I would have just bought a set of clippers at Target.Vicki CarlinSpring Green, WI"
1,Wahl not so good,"Clipper set comes with a ton of attachments, but is way to loud. You can hear it from the outside. Not very good overall"
2,Wahl clippers for australia,"the clippers look so good, and I couldn't wait to get them on my head to give myself a no 3 haircut.Problem was, that in Australia we run all our appliances at 240 volts and the clippers are set to USA standards....Bummer... so I went to the electric shop here to get the correct adapter to reduce the voltage, I can get that that for 50 bucks, which costs me more than the clippers.Then the salesman tells me that I will need another adaption?? That will correct the vibrations that make the product rattle and sound like a motorbike...It is set on 60 something or rather and we run on far less than that....Otherwise the product looks fantastic and I am upset that I can't use it unless I fork out more money...So be aware Australians Walh clippers need two electric adaptions if you are going to buy it from amazon and the USA....all the best ...Hairy eric"
1,"1 of Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper & Trimmer, 27 Pieces","1 of Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper & Trimmer, 27 PiecesSold by: Amazon.com LLCReason for return: Missing parts or accessoriesDetails: this order arrived incomplete to my place i openend the box today and just came clipper but did not arrived the mini clipper (Trimmer)please send miss itemResolution:"
3,So far it does what it's suppose to do.,"I bought this to save money by cutting my own hair. So far I have used it twice. The money I saved from going to a hair stylist has paid for it, so now it will be saving me more money as I continue to use it. Not sure how long these things hold up, but for this price I can't go wrong."
4,I liked it,"I have been looking for this Clipper and trimmer combo for a long time, finally got a good deal in amazon. I liked this 27 pieces because its a complete set. Clipper is good and easy to use, trimmer gives a fine touch. My wife didn't know how to clip n cut hair but this device is so simple that after following instructions she cut it in a perfect way. I have bought this about 2 months ago and it has given its price value already... So every new hair cut will be like free. I like it."
5,These clippers are AWESOME!!!!!,"Works really well. A little heavy, but that's ok. Way better than the clippers that I had before. Only thing I don't like about it is the cape that comes with it is so thin it's like a plastic bag. Other than that I love it."
4,Above Average!,I have been through a lot of hair clippers and this is one of the best choices personally. Cuts very smoothly and some of the attachments help and come in handy. I recommend it for any beginner just starting out and those who have experienced many failed machines. This product will be of greay use.
3,Well built but use with care,Compared to my older trimmers the Wahl is built much better. It is easy to use and has many attachments to choose from. The only problem I encountered while doing my sons hair was that it can actually draw blood. I took off the attachments and was trying to clean up around the front of the ear when I nicked him. Then doing the other ear I got him again. The old trimmers just didn't have the power to do something like that so I was caught off guard. All in all I think they are good trimmers but just require a little more care then other trimmers.
5,Wahl clipper/trimmer,This clipper works excellent. It has plenty of attachments. I would highly recommend this model to anyone interested in cutting your families hair.
2,problem,the cordless mini clipper does not work when we put batteries in it...tries multiple times and does not turn on
4,awesome,These clippers are great. They run smooth and cut great everything came with the product and works like professional clippers.
2,This Wahl clipper is cheaply made,I have been using a Wahl clipper for the last 20 years. They were always very sturdy and well made. This is the first new clipper I've purchased in the last 10 years. This Wahl clipper is very cheaply made. it is light and plastic and will probably not last very long. It is VERY different from the old Wahl clippers. I am wondering now if everything they make is cheap. No apparent way to find out...
2,I regret this purchase!,"Received item and first thing noticed, the mini trimmer was DOA and wouldn't work! The bigger trimmer is very loud and I can't seem to adjust it! Too bad I can't return it as I'd probably give it back. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,hoped for better,"I have used a small wahl bullet trimmer for years to give haircuts. My new full size clipper does not do as a good a job. I was dissappointed. I have tried adjusting, but it just doesn't seem to cut very well."
2,Sounds like a little tractor,"Functions were alright. But every second time turned on, it made very loud and unbearable noise. Was trying to fix the loosen screws but did not find anything loosed. The article returned."
3,Save Money,This is the only thing I'm using for cutting my hair now. It has been 2-3 year since we bought it and it still working great.
2,dull,"Worked great for the first few hair cuts, but after that, get dull quickly. We still use it because we're cheap, but is takes several passes to get it done."
5,Works wonders!,Was going to get my husband the balding clippers... But was too scared he'd take a chunk out. These work wonders and are so much better than store bought cheapies we have went through.
3,not of good quality,"have to return the item. It is not such good quality. Well, you can not expect mush with this price however i wish the quality would be much better. I returned the item"
3,"Okay, but Not Great","If you need a product to get a really close cut on African American hair, without tugs and pulls, this is not the product. It's not as close as other Wahl products, nor as sharp. But if you need the guides for various longer styles it should be great. I gave it to my dad for that reason. Also, the battery edger is basically a toy. If you really need a edger or trimer, you'd be better off buying a plug-in or rechargeable."
1,Works well... if it works at all,"I purchased these clippers about 5 months ago to start cutting my own hair. I got about 6 good haircuts with it, but unfortunately ran into one large issue. The more I used it, the gradually harder it was to move the power switch on and off. Eventually, the power switch jammed completely, and I was no longer able to turn the thing on. I sent the clipper to Wahl to get it repaired, paying around 15 dollars for shipping, and got it back around 2 weeks later. I used the clippers twice since then, and now the power switch is back to being jammed. This thing is no better than a paper-weight to me now. I really regret purchasing this clipper, and will be purchasing a new pair from a different brand sometime very soon."
2,Disapointed,"This is our second Wahl clipper. The first lasted 20+ years and my son took it with him to the Army. This new one lacks the quality of the first. The primary problem it the connection of the motor to the blade is plastic. The plastic works loose from the blade, causing the clipper to stop working. It requires a simple disassembly to fix the trouble (2 screws)but it is annoying to have to do it every 10-15 minutes. The $10 Conair clipper that we bought from Dollar General work much better. The extra doodads that come with the Wahl clipper are nice, but unnecessary. The scissors are junk, and who needs 12 different guides? 4 guides are enough for our family anyway. If I could return the Wahl clipper for a refund, I would."
4,Product is great as long as it's not USED,"The product works great but make sure you get a NEW one and not USED. Saw another review that stated clippers were covered with hair and the product was clearly used when purchased as new. Sounded a little strange when I first read it, but the same happened to me! Clippers had chunks of hair, spray bottle still had water in it, and scissors were clearly used as well. AMAZON DID MAKE THINGS RIGHT AND SHIPPED ME A NEW ONE THAT THAT WAS INFACT NEW. But the fact remains that a new one was purchased initially and a used one was sent. Other than that, product is fine."
2,Possible used product,"The product works fine but Amazon should be more upfront with the fact that you may be receiving a used or refurbished product. I took my clipper out of the bag and noticed that there were short bits of hair all over the blades. This doesn't affect the quality of the product but obviously someone had used it before me and the sight was a little gross, especially when you paid for a new item."
3,Just Okay,"I've owned at least 4 different Wahl clippers, and I was a little disappointed with the Chrome Pro. The on/off button seems to make the unit ""jump"" when turned on, and it's not a very smooth operation with a lot of extra humming and buzzing. The attachments also seem a little cheaper than from previous models I've purchased, so I've been using the old attachments. I really like the trimmer... it's great for side burns and trimming around the ears, and I only put a battery in it when I need it. The canvas carrying case is nice, but it could use a handle for easier transport.I liked the last Wahl clipper I had better, the Wahl 79900B Clip-N-Trim. The hard case, with handle, was even nicer. The only thing I didn't like about it was the trim feature because it broke after a while (although, I did drop it). The operation of the on/off button was much smoother too. In hindsight, I should have purchased another one."
2,Can't read the Attachment Numbers,I'll make it a quick and simple. Ordered this thinking it was the better one compared to the Wahl 79520-3101 which my son has which I always used.. Though it might have more pieces and it has a chrome finish upon opening it and inspecting it I boxed it up in a heart beat.. The main reason is the print on the cutter attachments are Very Very small. Ended up returning it and order the Wahl 79520-3101 which is much easyier to read and make out which size cutter attachment.
5,Simply stunning.,Beautifully written. Very entertaining. Collis writes in a manner which keeps you reading till the end of the adventure. I am very interested to read another by him.
4,STAND ALONE,This barbell stand is built very well and does a great job of getting your barbell plates off the floor. The price is what attracted me to this product as other stands seem to be either over-priced or constructed of lower quality metals. Be sure to check the hole diameter of your existing plates to make certain that this product will be able to accept your plates.
2,BOOO!!!! CAME WITH ONLY ONE LEG!!! BEWARE!!!,This unit was amazingly dirty for a new piece... (not a big deal) HOWEVER... it was shipped with only ONE LEG..... how does that happen????? GRRRRR. still stands up and will cost more to send back..... very disappointed! buy a different one..
5,Does the job at the right price,Got this plate rack to organize my home gym. It showed up on time and was easy to put together.
5,Great!,This was exactly what we were looking for to clean up the plates that my husband had laying around our workout room. It was extremely easy to put together and works great.
2,Little disappointed,"I assembled most of the item, except for the bottom handle part, the screw wouldn't fit at allow, we tried it numerous times, but it just wouldn't screw on. Finally I called the company CAP Barbell, noone answers the phone ever. So, I finally sent them an email. I must say the responce time was quick, and I asked them to send a replacement screw. I am hoping they will, if not I will return the product."
3,Missing All Hardware,"The rack arrived in a box that looked like it was retrieved from a dumpster. All the assembly hardward was missing. I'm waiting for the company to ship me some replacement hardware. In the mean time, I put the unit together using some bolts I had at home. It appears to do the job. I have about 30 plates in 10-5-2.5 lbs that I use on dumbbells and it holds them all. Some reviewers have commented about the center post: I was not able to install it without the head of the bolt scraping the floor. Maybe when I get the correct hardware it will work? I rate the product 3 stars based on 1 star for packaging/delivery and 5 stars for function: average is 3 stars."
5,Weight Rack,"I needed a weight rack for a lot of lose weights i had for working out. I liked the quality i got for my money, it works perfect for me. Does not hold 45 lb olympic plates but for what i needed it was just fine. Fast shipping, put together (easy)."
4,Venice Vacation,Melissa and her mother spend a summer in Venice where this little girl makes a special friend she will never forget. A delightful picture book for children to learn a few words in Italian.
2,disapointment,"I used this book during my pharmacology course and things proved to be harder than i expected.I always ended up looking things up in different books trying to understand why is this and why is that because despite its 600 pages this textbook somehow remains a review delevering only core information with inadequate degree of explanation. If you are in textbooks that go by ""the x drug has the y side-effect"" not explaing the underlying mechanism then this is definately your book!"
1,QUILTING WITH CAROL ARMSTRONG,This book was a disappointment in comparison with the other unique and pretty designs that Carol Armstrong's other books include. This book was dull and unexciting. Sorry.
5,A Delightful New Tale About Friendship,"Young Lu has always been told that as long as you have wonderful friends and family, you're never actually poor. But Lu, who has a great family, knows that she must be a little poor, for she doesn't actually have any friends. However, all that changes one day while Lu is taking a stroll along the Louisiana bayou, for she comes face-to-face with a real, live swamp ghost, who ultimately becomes her one true friend.Taking place during the Great Depression, James Carville has created a wonderful story that will show even the youngest reader that friends and family are more important than material items. Filled with super-adorable illustrations by David Catrow, LU AND THE SWAMP GHOST is sure to earn a place in the hearts of readers the world over.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"
4,Author's comment--,"As a frequent Amazon.com customer, I feel OK about supplementing the Kirkus Review (nice example of their famed snarky style--) of my book, ""How Aliens Think"". The title is, I admit, a take-off on anthropologist Levy-Bruhl's notorious ""How Natives Think."" Because yes, some of my stories do like to send up intellectual arrogance; and some use a college setting. But I resist the idea that this (and the fact that I freely use apostrophes) goes along with pedantry. No-one needs to know about Levy-Bruhl to get the point of what I'm doing. Plus, I've seen more heavy-duty pedantry in tomes such as Frank Herbert's ""Dune""-- There seems to be a creeping taboo here against fiction that shows the life of the mind, along with that of the body. If so, it's a taboo I'm happy to break-- JG"
4,Great for the price,"Just put together this item and it looks fantastic. It's quite comfortable, but I've yet to put it to the test so we'll see if it lasts. Initially, I'm very happy with this purchase!"
2,"Nice to read, but not what I and other readers would expect","The plot: Lex Luthor II is dying because of some clone deseases, and he desides to create another superman clone and put his mind on it. The clone obviously ends up a bizarro, escapes luthor and things happen. He tries to re-create his world (in an abandoned warehouse, not like in the 38's Superman), with Lois in it.The story is nice to read, but it's most definitely not what I would have expected when I saw the title. The excuse to re-create Bizarro was stupid. Bizarro's World wasn't another misformed planet, but some sort of old warehouse. Plus, it's a 5-issues story when it could have been a lot less, they just made it bigger to sell more.Anyway, it's not boring. I would just read something better, like ""Erradication!""."
3,Fight Song UK Edition,"Personally, I would recommend this disc for the hardcore Manson fans. The tracks are the album version of ""The Fight Song,"" a remix of ""Disposable Teens"" and a remix of ""The Love Song."" ""Disposable Teens"" was not remixed by any of the band members, it was remixed by Bon Harris. ""The Love Song"" was remixed by Bon Harris and Madonna Wayne Gacy. This Bon Harris individual enjoys putting soundbites into the songs such as a sarcastic, blasphemous version of ""Jesus Loves The Little Children."" Also, discreet references are made to the recent school shootings. The remixes are mediocre in my opinion, therefore I only suggest hardcore fans get this one."
4,Another winner by David Adler,"This is a 27-page picture book. A grandfather explains tohisgranddaughter how he received the tattooed number on his arm duringhis internment at Auschwitz. True story of a Polish holocaust survivor. Brief but good description of the holocaust and treatment of the Jews. Photographs illustrate this book, some from WWII."
2,Read it on the plane,"Jumping back and forth, this book is disconcerting because of repetions that confuse rather than illuminate. At one point, Mivart, whose ideas have been discussed, is reintroduced as if we had never heard of him. Text is encountered that you could swear you've read before and you continue wondering if a mistake was made by the printer until you are rescued with ""as we mentioned in chapter three."" Descriptions of the theory and the scientific background within which it appeared are well done. Very easy reading to pass that long plane trip but leaves you feeling less than well acquainted with the man; better simply as an introduction to his theory. When done reading, I felt like a carnivore who has just consumed a plate of vegetables. Not memorable. No demands made on the mind of the reader."
1,a biography with no basis in history,"Oh dear! The authors didn't do their homework and like so much on Darwin is not aware of recent research. Lots of inaccuracies and hopeless on Fanny his first girl friend, whose grave I walk over most days of the week. The bigots in ""The Battle aganist Bigotry"" are the authors themselves as they give a crude parody of Sam Wilberforce who gave stand SCIENTIFIC objections to Darwin. Why do publishers publish such rubbish?"
4,Nice Book,A nice collection of reviews and information gathered from lots of sources. Covers the Discovery I very well.
4,Good Book and glad that I read it,"I picked this up not knowing what to expect and found that I liked it a lot. In fact, it only me a day and a half to get through the whole thing.I found it to be informative and fun. It has inspired me to find out more about Joan of Kent and that whole time period. I hope that others read it and give it a chance. I think that you'll like what you find.Now to find her other books and hope that they are as good."
4,I can't believe all the negatives on this book,"So what that some of the ages of the major characters don't add up. The love story is true and the author's creation of Joan's and Prince Edward's characters and relationship with each other is very believable. Prince Edward was arrogant and self assured just as a prince in his time should be. What woman wouldn't enjoy the attention, desire, and eventually, the love of a most beloved prince. I have to warn those fans of true historical novels, such as those of Sharon Kay Penman, that this is more of a romance novel. But, it is still a fun read."
2,First Princess Review,"Not a difficult read, but not exactly memorable. I thought that the main character was portrayed as naive and flighty in times when she would have been a much more mature figure.Too many cliche phrases that made me almost embaressed for the author and editor to read. Will keep in my collection, but only because I hate to see a book go to waste."
2,Crappy historical fiction,"I don't understand why many historical fiction authors seem to think all their readers want a romance novel. I read these for the research and the narrative - NOT the sex. WAY TOO MUCH gratuitous sex in this book. Furthermore, it's even pretty graphic, and it's distracting. It doensn't add to the story (hence, it being gratuitous).Furthermore, just from my limited historical research, some facts were changed unnecessarily (for instance, the ages of the Prince and Joan of Kent - which are fairly well documented). That's annoying and dishonest.Finally . . . if I ever never see the word ""tawny"" again in my life, it will be too soon. It's like the author didn't want us to forget that the Prince is blond. Thanks - I don't need a reminder EVERY SINGLE PAGE. Especially when you can't come up with a different adjective to describe it."
5,Best Read Ever,"For those who don't understand the difference: Historical fiction is just that...FICTION (which means it's not real). If you are looking for FACTS (which is NON FICTION and that means its real) then this book is not for you, it would be better for you to research Joan of Kent and the Black Prince by other means. If, however you wish to lose yourself in a richly written book, then this is just the book for you. Yup, it's a historical romance novel, so what? But make no mistake it is well written and you will not be able to put it down!"
1,I'm disappointed.,"I waited anxiously for this book to be released because the Last Boleyn Girl was such a great read. However, this novel reads like a souped up Harlequin romance. Truly, the dialogue kind of ""irks"" me... I mean, ""dear heart, this and dear heart"" that... I wish that someone else would write a review so I can see if I'm the only one that thinks this book was a waste of my money."
5,The First Princess of Whales,This was a great book. I could not put it down until I was done reading it. It was the best book I have read in a long time.
1,FLOSSIN WILL LEAVE YOU FLINCHING,"Another supposed spring break t and a tape. Tape runs about 70 minutes, has about 5 total minutes of girls doing ""booty shake"" dances in bathing suits. The camera is fairly still during these dances, you won't get sea sick as you would with a Luke video. At least someone knows how to hold a camera. But the remaining 65 minutes consist of watching cars arrive in town, cars driving on the beach, an occasional 3 second flash of girls on the beach, and lots of guys with their faces in the camera...this tape should be 5 minutes long. And would never be purchased if seen first. Truth be told."
3,Str8,Yo this here tape is aight lots of female but very low budget ya dig. Nothing like the Luke Freakshow tapes.
5,The best fantasy book I've read in along time.,"I first read this book when I was 17,that was 20 years ago! I still LOVE this book.I re-read it every so often.It's full of Goddess worship and magick. I still recommend it to my friends."
2,Hard to follow because poorly written,"The following is a sentence from page 131 paragraph 1 of this book: ""After declaring a generic Node object to serve as the parent node for the new node, and a variable to hold our function response, which we optimistically set to True - which will be changed if our attempt at adding the node fails, we check to see if the node index is within bounds, using IsNodeIndexOK, described just after this function.""The logical flow to the entire book in not much better.This makes learning anything about XML and VB difficult. I have spent more time attempting to determine what the authors are tring to say than I have learning about XML.I was able to work with the sample code to some extent. But even the sample code was incomplete and more difficult to follow than necessary.With a complete rewrite this could possibly be a good book."
2,Not very good,"I have always had high expectation of Wrox for being the best in technical books, but this book was very disappointing. The book is good at telling what XML is and what the application of XML is good for, but does a very poor job at showing the HOW TO of implementing XML. Most of the codes demonstrated are in portions and tid bits and was very difficult to decipher."
2,Little of everything,"Not a good book if you do not know XML. Book does not go into detail explaining XML.(eg. different types of entities, DTDs; the ""why"" behind it ? )If you already know XML then it is provides some decent information about incorporating XML into your VB projects. Although that info is also available to a very large extent for free on internet.I returned the book."
5,Maybe I'll Catch Fire,"Love the title, love the songs, simple as that. I like 9 out of the 10 songs on this album!! This is defenitly in my list of all time favorites. I've listened to it every single day scince I bought it. Very addicting songs!! The only one I don't like is ''SleepyHead'',I thinks it's kinda annoying. This is on my all-time favorite label ""ASIAN MAN RECORDS""!! If you like punk, BUY THIS ALBUM!! You won't be dissapointed!!"
5,News,You can can get this wonderful cd off asianmanRecords.com for 8 dollars shiping included. just thought i would tell every one
5,One of the best cd's i have ever heard,"This is such an amazing effort. Alkaline Trio has emerged as the best pumk band around. Their music is unreal and their lryics are beautiful and haunting. There is alot of Elvis Costello in their lyrics, and they are a rare punk band that will allow their songs to go over 2:00. This is one of the best cd's i have ever heard.....Every song will stay with you forever, and Radio is a great song for any of you who have been dumped or hurt by a girl, you'll want them to listen to that song so you can you say screw you to. Good Stuff."
5,Excellent album,"That other review is way off. This new CD is amazing. These guys have great songwriting ability, (something that most bands in the ""emo/post punk/pop punk/whatever"" genre lack. This is way better than their last disc, which is also great. Sounds like a mix of Samiam and Bracket, with Elvis Costello vocals. Almost every song is great, with about 4 or 5 standout tracks. Worth every cent. Listen to samples and decide for yourself."
4,One of the best albums ever,"The Alkaline Trio are an incredibly underrated band -- to stick them in any one category doesn't do them justice. The songwriting ability that's jammed up in this band is amazing. Songs like ""Radio"" and ""Madame Me"" prove the incredible ability that Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have to punch in great chord changes that are comparable to late great Nirvana. Punk can't hold these guys, emo can't hold these guys, pop, indie ... none of those categories have the flexibility to have the Alkaline Trio placed in there. The lyrics are amazing; dark and humorous but at the same so filled with joy and pain and anger that you get swept up into these guys heads' immediately. This band is proof that simplicity is a VERY undervalued characteristic in music, but that doesn't mean that creativity has to take a cut either. Best songs on the album: ""Tuck Me In"", ""Radio"", ""Sleepyhead"", ""Madame Me"", ""Keep 'Em Coming""."
2,worst of all,"This is the worst album made by my favorite band. Its monotone, annoying and depressing. Its not depressing in a good way either and its more annoying than anything else. Track 1,4 and 10 are my favorites, Radio is the best one. I heard Hot Water Music's version of Radio before Alkaline Trios version and I like it more, so this version was kind of a let down. Almost every song on this cd made me wanna press the skip button. Skip this cd, buy it after you get all the other Alkaline Trio albums. I recommend buying them in this order: From Here to Imfirmary, God Damnit, Good Mourning. My favorite is God Damnit, I really cant think of an album from any band that I like more."
3,A big letdown.,"After playing Goddamnit about 1000 times over the past year and a half, maybe I was expecting too much from the followup LP. The lyrics on this CD don't live up to the lyrics on the first album -- there's nothing on here I'll be singing in my head come six months from now. Almost all of the music sounds as if it's a rehash from Goddamnit. If you can find a copy of this for cheap in a used bin, pick it up. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
1,Yuck,"If you didn't like emo before, you'll hate it with a vengeance upon unfortunately listening to this album. It's quite difficult to tell which among the 10 songs is which since they pretty much sound all the same."
1,POOR COUNTERFEIT CD,Unfortunately this CD listed here is not an original CD. It is a copy from an LP to a CD and the quality is pretty poor. And 2 other Studio Recordings listed here in Amazon are also copies. So if you see this CD listed here even if the seller states it as brand new don't believe it because the idea is to deceive you into believing you have an original CD in your hands which is not. You can also buy it and see for yourself and then return it for a full refund. I wish one day the will edit her 3 great albums on an original CD.
2,Part numbers if ya need 'em,If your looking for a list of original part numbers this is for you. If you need restoration and assmebly tips your going to be disappointed.
5,Hi-Capacity Camcorder Battery Panasonic VDR-D105,Fast and efficient service. Product was not wrapped or in a box which seemed odd. Product works fine.
5,This candle really works,"I love the Honeysuckle scent of this candle. Even though it's Honeysuckle, it doesn't have a really 'flowery' scent, it's more of a fresh scent and really makes my home smell good. I love the crackle that the wick makes."
4,Functional book,"This book provides a thorough list of hikes in a fantastic part of the state, but I agree that the descriptions are a bit sparse and cryptic. Personally, I prefer greater detail about what I might encounter on the trail rather than just the facts -- see Roach's 14er book as an example."
5,I have not reviewed this CD because there are no contents,How can you expect anyone to buy this when there is no way to determine what its contents are? Come on people get a life and bite the bullet and do the work to include the contents by song title and artist and a general discription of the CD.
4,Crusin Happy!!!!,"This is the first tycoon game I have purchased for me. I have really enjoyed playing. There is alot to watch at one time. The graphics are great. It took a little practice to get the hang of turning the ship. At first I sank many ships. If you detour to far off course you will run out of gas and have to be towed in, this hurts your reputation. All in all I find this game to be fun and additing. Your guest will let you know what they want and it can be a job trying to please them all. I don't play on the computer very much but I have enjoyed this game. It would have gotten 5 stars but it does have a flaw, it stalls in certain situations. For $20.00 it is good entertainment. Buy the game."
1,AWFUL GAME,"This game sounds fun, of course it sounds fun to build a cruise ship,but this is not fun. I was bored with it long before the night was over. One problem is that it can seem like a total waste of time because you have to watch the map and if you run into a disaster, your ship will sink and you have to start all over. You can also not change your route after you have choosen it, you have to just go around in circles.This does not measure up to roller coaster tycoon or the Sims at all. There is not much to do with it."
1,No No No!,"I don't mean to be negative, but this game truly isn't worth your time. I have loaded it on two different computers, one on which it freezes before even getting past the first screen, the other on which I can play for a maximum of five minutes before it freezes the computer up entirely. I read some negative reviews, but I thought 'hey, they're just being negative' but not I. I've gone in with a very positive attitude, only to be very disappointed. It might be a fine game, if you can get it to work. As for me, I say don't waste your money or your time. It's a good idea, but terribly done."
3,It's fun for a while...,"Oh, I remember this game. It would keep me occupied well when I was little. You could build, spend, and go bankrupt trying to keep the people happy. It did get old after a while though...and kind of repetitive after it was actually builtI must say though, the main highlight of this game for me, was taking complaining passengers, and throwing them off the ship XDYOU KNOW YOU DID IT TOO!!!"
2,White,After I started the game Everything was In BLACK AND WHITE! also it would not let me move around anywhere besides that screen.
2,Not a great game,"Hi, I bought this game and when in Instant Action Mode I started out with the smallest ship. I now have over 300,000 in cash and no way to upgrade my ship. All my decks are packed ! I can't possibly place anything else. Basically there is no where left for me to go except to start a new game with a bigger ship. Totally stupid, there should be a way to upgrade your ship in Instant Action mode. I don't suggest buying this game for that reason."
5,good game,"I think it is a good game to have fun with, but one thing that dissapoints me is if you hit an icberg, Rock, run aground or get attacked by the giant squid your ship sinks right away. I would like it better if you could see the obstacle ahead, here a bump, grinding noise or something, inspect the damage and see the leaks, see the water flooding into the ship, seeing where the water is, seeing the ship slowly become submerged, see the list the ship has developed, maybe even have compartments with watertight doors and be able to stay afloat with the first two flooded, sound a siren, launch the lifeboats, see the completely flooded decks underwater, maybe even see the ship break in two when it sinks, give the order to abandon ship, see how deep the water is it has sunk in, send out SOS calls, see how much time there is before the ship sinks, explore the wreck later in a submersible. That would be way better if Cat daddy games made it that way. I would be so happy if they did!"
1,DON'T BUY,Don't buy this software! It is not ready for sale or distribution. I have never had a problem loading or using any software like I had with this piece of garbage. Do the research online. Find other sites concerning this game. You'll see so many problems....just not worth it believe me!
2,Dont waste your money,"This game has no tutorial. Plus, at every sailing you are crashing into unavoidable rocks. THis was such a waste of money. I love all tycoon games but this is not up to par with the least of them. The box, looks good, but beware .It is a waste"
3,Ok Most people think this is a horrible game....,"When I got this game as a present I thought OH awesome...BUT WHEN YOU START BUILDING THE ROOMS...YOU HAVE TO DO THEM ONE AT A TIME (UNKLINE ZOO TYCOON WHERE YOUR BUILING A FENCE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CLICK OVER AND OVER TO BUILD ONE) On this for each tiny room you have to click on the bar click on the rooms and click on the room you choose to buy! It takes like 15 seconds to do that alone and then you have to do that about 25 times to fill up a deck. The Game itself is OK I mean you get to stir the boat and look at he craxy people on board and even throw em' over board if you don't like em'! There is another horrible thing You loose your monry really Fast You started loosing a ton of money just buy building rooms... I personally would not reccommend this. unless you don't care about money, time, or stuff, I olay this game when I am bored...."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought the game out of desperation. And if you are the same way, you might be interested in the game. It does fill a little bit of time, but only for a few days. It gets boring, and the graphics are not as good as I had hoped. The box shows better graphics than there really is, and I have a top of the line computer. Beginning gameplay is a bit confusing, and there is no tutorial, or if there is one.. you can't find it, to teach you what to do. I guess I was spoiled with The Sims.. Good luck with your game if you decide to buy!"
1,I wish I had read all the reviews!,"This is probably one of the worst sim games I have played. I can't seem to get into the action for more than 5 minutes or it will crash. But the game is so boring, maybe 5 minutes is all I could take anyway."
5,Amazing Book,"What I enjoyed most about this book is the realness and the concern I had for the characters after I finished reading the book. The events are true and could happen, it's real life, with real situtaions. Rozelle puts his words and thoughts together as if they are hooked by links of a chain."
2,The most information from the smallest book,"This is one of the most powerful books, packed with useful information in a very easy to read 75 page format. This book is easy to understand with real world concepts that work.The information is clear and understandable and can be applied to all business, government and non-profit organizations and can be applied at any level of management.I recommend this book to any person at any level of management, this should be a must read when entering into the management field!"
1,Terrible,Terrible sound quality. Sounds like the speakers are broken after being installed. The old speakers that were 20+ years old and cracked sounded better than these do.
5,"Great ""How To"" Guide for Self-Help and Inspiration","Amy uses a combination of anacdotal stories and good old fashioned common sense to help readers to help themselves through some of life's darker hours. Through a series of short and easy to read sections, she gets right to the heart of the problem and then provides an easy work-through to a solution. This book may not change your whole life, but I think that it just may change it enough to help you onto the right path. The rest is up to you."
5,Wonderful,"The British journal Gramophone gave this disk a rave review, and I understand why. This is gorgeous stuff. Romantic, in the Chopin/Brahms mode, but distinctive. Try it, if you like Romantic music, I guarantee you will love this recording!"
5,Beam Me Up Scotty!,"A friend recommended this CD to me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when I finally did buy it and listen. This music transports you. Sure the quality of the musicianship is unparalled in popular music, but it's the emotion and messages that will rejuvenate your spirit and make you very happy that your (and Gemma's) paths crossed. This is great for a creating a special mood, a good listen or parties. Buy it or miss out!"
5,Excellent pictorial monograph,"If you are interested in flight jackets, their design, styles and art work, then this book is for you. There are literally hundreds of colour and black and white photographs of aviator leather jackets. World War Two jackets are covered in detail as are Korean and Vietnam period flight jackets. The book is well set out, has large high resolution photographs and is a well constructed hardcover. The only fault I could find with the book is that in many of the photographs it fails to identify the jacket type and specification. It also does not deal with jacket construction or design. As with many of Maguire's books it has excellent reference photographs and information on who used or wore the artical in question, but fails to provide detailed information on the item other than the basics. Still, it is worthwhile addition to a library, although the book is expensive."
3,Fairly good but...,"I have read every one of these book collections that I can get my hands on, and I have only one dissapointment, THIS ONE!! I bought it because I had read #1, #2 ,and #4 and thought their was alot missing. Boy was I wrong, the only reason I am giving it what I am giving it what I'm giving it is because of 2 or 3 of the fights and Osborn's struggles (his amnesia (see last volume) is causing him to become confused about himself). Other than that Nothing doin'!"
5,Profound and unexpected glimpses of a great mystery,"Nicoll studied under Ouspensky.They and another of his students, Rodney Collin, explicate the mystery of time similarly.They say our ordinary concept of time, which is linear and calendrical, is an illusion.That Time like physicality has three dimensions, but which we cannot clearly sense.This touches on the concomitant mysteries of birth, death........and rebirth.Essentially in the Platonian sense phenomena do not exist in the straightforward temporal way we assume it does.Reincarnation is a perversion of Recurrence, which is the idea that experience exists outside of time in a sense, independent of it.A vague sense of recollection of identical or nearly identical experiences is about the only connection we can have with any awareness of the real nature of time.Indian theology introduces the concept of Maya, or illusion, as also addressed by Plato.Therefore we can only have a very fragmentary glimpse of reality, of the totality of experience."
2,"Only 3 1/2""","This is a good cushion but it is NOT 4"" thick as stated. It is only 3 1/2"" ONLY. They need to tell the truth for once."
4,"An interesting ""behind the scenes"" look","This book is a fun read about a first year Major League Baseball franchise. After a brief discription pertaining to the history of baseball in Denver, the book details the day to day revere of a unique franchise. It was interesting to see, not only what it takes for a City to petition MLB for an expansion team but the day to day operations involved with playing 81 home games a year. From the front office to the stadium, to the dugout, any baseball fan will find this book intriguing."
5,An Epic Tale of Today,"After my friend got me hooked on the second book [had to go back and read the first and then the rest] I was reading pages like nothing before. Through the cycle you will see the characters develop, and soon you will find yourself having a 'friendship' with them- being sad or extremely worried to blushingly happy for them. The Deathgate Cycle is perhaps one of the best series of books ever, and I am glad that I have experienced it. One thing that I absolutely love about these books is the mystery involved in them. You are constantly thinking ""What happened?"", ""Why are they going to do that?"", ""Who was that?"", ""How are they going to do that?"". And yet after the end of them all, a few mysteries remain unanswered, to be eternally up to the reader's thought and thinking. If you want an intense experience full of suspense, ponderings, and emotions the Deathgate Cycle is certainly the answer"
5,Best series I've ever read!!,"This series is a masterpiece of fantasy writing. It is by far Weis and Hickman's best series. I found it to be a very unique plotline and it pulled me in as soon as I had finished the first chapter. I listen to music when I read and I listened to one cd constantly while I was reading this series. It is now my favorite cd and every time I hear it, it reminds me of the books I love so much. In fact I have just started re-reading the entire series. I would recommend it to everyone and anyone who passes up the opportunity to read it is at a great loss."
3,Well illustrated but also a bit confusing,"This is a nicely illustrated book, if a bit overly done and the two-page layout is confusing. Windows XP usage is presented in a step-by-step manner, so it's easy to follow. A good start for newcomers to the wonderful world of XinXP."
2,Dont Listen To Tom,"This CD was a huge dissapointment. I am a big Dont Look Down fan and was expected more great music when i purchased this cd, little did i know it was full of crap. Dont Look Down is falling into the mainstream trend of more acoustic guitar, slower songs, and just crappy music. Bender and Wake me are decent songs. But that slow stuff is gotta go. If you ask me, dont buy the album and keep rocking out to Start The Show and older albums of theirs."
1,Too Sharp,The litter is sharp and caused my cat's paws to bleed. I had blood all over my carpet. I hope they come out with softer pellets.
3,Bug. The Original Movie,"I never saw Ashley Juggs version, but Bradford Dillman's is very good. It has a very good, suspenseful story, and the special effects and makeup is decent for that time period. This is one of my favorite movies."
3,strange bug flick that is worth a look.,"This one which opened the same day as 'jaws' did at the theaters back in 70's was a small budget william castle flick. It looks pretty good and it's still intriguing but not a standard monster on the loose movie, instead it reminds me of the classic first version of 'willard' , which had the cool sequel 'ben' by the way and both deserve to be put out on dvd or blu ray together. It's about a scientists relationship with the bugs which set people on fire. So it's a slow mover but intriguing and different. I like it thoug and if you have patience you will too. DOn't expect modern effects though and remember that for audiences in the seventies they were not unhappy with the what they saw in that regard. The dvd has a decent print and no extras really."
3,Strange,"How can any self respecting film buff (I hate that word!) not like Bug? Fascinating because it is uncommercial to the point of perversity. Bugs copulating is what punters pay for? The film is slow, obsessive and sadistic without good reason."
1,Bug,I have always loved this movie. I have watched this movie a number of times since the first time I wanted it back in the 80s. I was glad to find out that it was on DVD and had to buy it. I am glad I did.
3,HOT ROACHES,"BUG was the last film horror maven William Castle made. He co-wrote the script and served as its producer. It's a bizarre little tale about some fiery cockroaches unleashed after an earthquake in a small California community. Under NIGHT GALLERY vet director Jeannot Swarzc's direction and with an eerie electronic score by Charles Fox, the movie manages to have some real chills. Bradford Dillman is quite good as the professor who becomes obsessed with the bugs after they kill his wife, Joanna Miles. As expected, he manages to breed them with another roach and they become incendiary and intelligent killers. Not a classic of the genre, but it is a creepy little thriller with some nasty bugs!!!"
5,A witty collection of musings and short stories!,"I enjoyed reading this book because the author strives to present humor in a different context. He is very descriptive of the short stories presented within and some of them are hit or miss. However, it's not whether a story hits you or not that matters. This book will most likely appeal to people who are looking for something that's modest and yet, still hits the target humor-wise. One particular story that I liked was ""Identity Crisis"" and the author does quite a good job at describing the character and his shortfalls. Overall, Chris Federico is someone to watch out for. I look forward to reading his next book."
5,You're My Favorite Author.,"My first impression of this book, Is that it would go perfect on the back of my commode. Is that to say this is toilet humor?? Heck no. Many chapters are short, the perfect size for those times when you want a quick humorous read. Move over Bathroom Reader! I highly recommend giving this new author a try."
5,The Movers Rock,"Both my seven and three year old sons love the Movers. This album has been listened to a lot, and I would suggest this one to anyone. This one really gets them dancing, and actually, mom and dad too! Just wish we would have had a band like the Movers when we were little!"
5,Highly Recommend,"My two and three year old girls love it. The music is easy to listen to for parents as well. They aren't the typical kids songs, they have a good message."
1,Book description not accurate,"The book description was not accurate in regards to the amount of writing inside the book as well as the damaged cover. There was a large amount of writing in the book as well as underlining and dog eared pages. I was prepared for a small amount of inside writing and dog eared pages, but was overwhelmed with the amount that was actually done."
3,Serves its purpose,This book is pretty much boring and old fashioned but it is what was needed for the course. Would buy again but wouldn't keep.
3,Good review DVD,"This is the DVD if you are learning or have learned Yang short form, Cheng Man Ching lineage and want help practicing at home. It is not the one for learning the form. Pricey,but for the help I get, it's been worth it."
1,Disappointed,The DVD was not what I expected. I was disappointed because the explanations of movements were very vague and the demonstrations did not help.
3,tiny glossy book that glosses over the facts,"This book was written for people who truly do not know anything about the Hebrew alphabet. The book is tiny, the pictures of the letters are really pretty and big and shiny, and the writing is kind to the mind. Great gift idea for kids or for seekers who aren't sure if they want to be pagans or monotheists or atheists. Or for Jews to give Christians who have a lot to learn without offending them. It is a pretty gift book, not a scholary tome. Poeple have found it heart warming. The quality of the paper really is exceptional. You could frame the letters. I am a Jesus freak and have given this book as a gift and it has been loved by Jews and Christians and atheists."
5,Beautifully Illustrated,"This book makes a lovely gift for any Jewish household. It also gives an in-depth perspective on each individual letter's identity. Gorgeous, high-end quality printing."
4,A great gift!,"This is a gorgeous, spiritual book. Makes an amazing gift for anyone interested in learning more about the deep symbolism of the Hebrew alphabet. I've given it as a gift to a girl who was becoming a Bat Mitzvah. I don't know if she'll appreciate it right away, but I bet when she's a bit older, it will be as much a treasure to her as it is to me. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars just because I wish there was more detail for each letter. The artwork is the highest quality...eye candy with so much meaning. Wish it came as a poster, too, because it would be lovely as hangable artwork. Blessings..."
5,The Living Years...and Eternal Living,"Mike Rutherford and Paul Young will forever live with their touching tribute song, ""The Living Years.""The beautiful vocal harmonies, the lyrics blend in with your soul (At least it did mine), and it made me realize how special living with the people you care about really is. You have to appreciate the people you care about when you have the chance, and I have to say, thanks to this song, I am a better man.I appreciate my loved ones, more so now than ever before, and whenever I play ""The Living Years"", it will always make me glad I stumbled onto this song when listening to Casey Kasum's top 40."
4,A few tracks at a time...,"Four stars? Yes. I enjoy the first two tracks so much that this album, because of them alone, deserves four stars. tracks 3 - 10? Individually they're all good in their own way, but one after another? They feel like inspirational self-esteem buinding pieces. The kind you'd workout to in an 80's film before going and giving you're long time bully his comeuppance. One after another? I'd have to be one step from jumping to need this entire album all at once. I would recommend this album...a few tracks at a time."
1,Big disappointment,Upon hearing the great single Living Years I immediately and eagerly purchased the CD... and played it several times in disgust and shock. I kept hoping I just hadn't been paying attention. I was.This is poorly composed formula pop and in my opinion is uninspired. Just buy the single. The rest of this piece of caca is a waste of your time and money.The first album and Word of Mouth are great discs worth having. Buy them instead. My 2 cents.
5,Macho Memories,"The album is worth the price even with only the lyrics of one song ""The Living Years."" The cycle of machizmo gets past on from man to boy, forever and ever. We are prisoners of ourselves. Someday I'll move on to the other songs on this album. Right now I'm caught up in tears in my living years.Wonderful Song."
5,Farewell Selection,"Excellent original choice 4 me. I've selected this CD 4 my final tailored CD of 15 personal favorite songs I've enjoyed in my lifetime 2 B shared by my family in memory of my future passing. If one uses a 12"" ruler as a metaphor of one's lifetime.....I've used up approximately 11"" of it by now so I am preparing 4 the inevitable. The melody is sufficiently contemporary & the lyrics R penetrating.C'est la vie."
5,THE band,"These guys have a unique soundthat can only be understood byactually listening to their music.I'm not even sure what category they would fall into,but it has a mellow, real rock and roll sound to it.A great addition to anyone's collection."
5,A fine retrospective,"During their decade of existence, Carter USM were consistently one of the best acts in the UK indie scene, both live and on record. One memorable review described their music as ""The Clash meets the Pet Shop Boys"", which seems fairly accurate if a bit too simplistic.Dismissed in the US as either a novelty act or as ""too English"", Carter (James Robert Morrison, a.k.a. ""Jim Bob"" and Les ""Fruit Bat"" Carter) nevertheless made outstanding music full of energy and wit and compassion and righteous indignation at the state of mankind. Although they officially split a few years back, they still come up with the occasional collaboration under the name Who's The Daddy Now? as well as their individual projects, Jim's Super Stereoworld and Abdoujaparov, respectively.This compilation is a good place to start."
2,Dissapointing-Not appropriate for teens at all.,"I cannot speak for the rest of the Creative Bible Studies lessons, however after being recommended Doug Fields materials, I though I'd give this a shot for a weekend youth ministry.These lessons are low on scripture and focus more on cheesy little ministry cliches that are going to do nothing for today's youth. They may be affective for 5/6th grades but not for any age older. These lessons certainly won't fit well into Sunday School either considering how light they are. These may make some decent supplements to other lessons here and there but I really would not recommend it either as they are simply going to make your students roll their eyes and can't believe you were able to say that without laughing at yourself."
3,Oy!,"Apparently some people don't get the joke. This isn't really a compilation of rare Christmas songs from all over the world. All the songs here were actually recorded specifically for this album by one group of people. The songs are done in various styles; such as marching band, Jewish, Arabian, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Santo & Johnny, surf, polka and many others. It's pretty fun, although it isn't ""laugh out loud"" funny. It's more of an ""isn't that clever"" type of humor, that will make you smile but probably won't make you chuckle. Fans of novelty Christmas music may want to check it out."
1,Lame It On Christmas,"I can't believe the Amazon reviewer liked this so much. It is a waste of money. You'll know it was a mistake within four songs, maybe three. If you want good novelty Christmas music, this is not it. I sure wish I'd done more research than just take the word of the Amazon reviewer."
1,"Probably defective; if not, just worthless","Amazon's delivery was great: I got the mouse within 24 hours. Coincidence or not that it came from a nearby ""Amazon Return Center."" Mouse worked poorly or not at all. The optical reader would not work on a basic black desk blotter (on which all other optical mice have worked fine). It worked sporadically on the wood desk surface. The mouse was probably defective and returned before Amazon shipped it out to me."
1,Stopped working after 1 year,After about 1 year my mouse stopped working. It developed the most annoying habit of double clicking when I single clicked. I tweaked my mouse settings and there was nothing I could do to get my mouse to stop double clicking. Of course it only did it 25% of the time so I kept using it for a few weeks but eventually I started to lose my mind and threw it away. Since most mice would work with my Mac I grabbed an old PC mouse I had and presto I was back in action and that trip to the psycho ward was avoided.
5,THANK YOU,"I just want to thank everyone who left a review about this product who helped convince me to buy it. I was really skeptical about buying a mouse for my macbook online but I couldn't find any that matched in the stores nearby. This mouse is amazing. I recently switched from a PC to a MAC and I'm loving it. My only complaint was that I hated the one button mouse. This works great with my mac and allows left, and right clicking and the added bonus of the scroller in the middle with NO INSTALATION REQUIRED. Just plug in the USB cord and go. I swore I'd never do one of these reviews but I was just so excited about it that I had to post. Don't hesitate...buy this mouse, especially if you're a mac user. It is definately a deal for your money and looks great alongside my mac."
1,"Two fatal flaws, to me.","What makes a good mouse is a pretty personal set of criteria.For me, this mouse has two fatal flaws.I tend to grip my mouse as if my hand was a claw, meaning that I use the tip of my thumb on one side and pinky on the other, and click with my index and middle fingers.With this mouse, however, the claw approach doesnt work. For one, the sides of it are too slick, which makes gripping it difficult. Secondly, the mouse buttons dont extend all the way to the front of the mouse, so if you have long fingers, you find yourself trying to click where there is no button.My other compaint is the wheel doesn't have very good tactile feedback."
2,"Don't Hold Tune Well, Not My Favorite","I've always used Elixirs. Saw the good reviews for this set and figured I'd give them a try since they were 60% cheaper. They didn't feel or sound as good. Also, they didn't stay in tune well at all. I have a Taylor 214ce and with Elixirs, I've been regularly surprised by how well those strings stay in tune. Maybe these strings just don't mesh with my particular guitar, but they failed my test."
4,Decent Replacement,"This battery is definitely better than my olde one (one of the small NPF-550s); as far as I can tell battery life's great. The major problem that I have with it is it will not spring-loadedly release out of the back of the camera when the ejecting lever's pushed. You must shake the camera for it to fall out. Besides that, it ain't bad. Get it."
2,not a good replacement for the Sony battery,The battery fit into the compartment in the video camera but would not eject when pressing the eject button. Had to shake the camera and coax the battery out with a screwdriver. I returned the battery and will get the Sony replacement
1,Drive Error c:32-01,"I enjoyed the fact that this camera allowed me to zoom in up to 10X and record the data on floppy discs instead of expensive digital cards. This allowed for various themes seperated by cards. All this came to an end after I had the camera just over a year with drive error C:32-01. After research on the problem including hundreds of listed similar problems, I found that Sony charged under 20 dollars for the part and about 150 dollars for the labor. I understand that this common problem has been eliminated in more recent mavicas, but Sony lost my support in their lack of customer care."
5,Sony has done it again...,"This camera is......wow.I was surprised by this camera. Since it was so bulky, I thought it was just a peice of trash.....How wrong was I?¿Pros:10X zoom (A GREAT feature to have)Different picture typesUses floppy disk (saves money from buying EXPENSIVE memory sticks)Cons:Takes a while to chargeAfter you charge it, if you use it for about more than 1 hour, it starts to get warm (I guess thats normal?)Bulky (heavier than most other digital cameras)I used this camera to take pictures at the daycare at which I volunteer. My teacher explained to me how to use it in less than 1 minute. It's VERY easy to use and a lot of fun!! I even taught a 4 year old how to use this!!!! I suggest this camera to anyone."
2,OH NO!!,"We bought this as a back up for our primary digital camera (Sony FD95 - a GREAT camera). Came to discover that this one will not accept a Sony floppy disc adapter and memory stick! Takes only a floppy disk, which has very limited storage when you shoot high resolution (which we do.)Very disappointed, which we had been more careful about checking this out, just because its a Sony doesn't mean it accepts a memory stick. Buyer BEWARE!"
4,Around the World With the Mavica,"I recieved this camera in May 2001 as a graduation gift right before leaving the country for 6 months abroad. I can't say enough good things about the Mavica--I literally took it around the world and captured some amazing sights along they way--and was able to share all of them with friends and family all over the world. The floppy disks make on the go transfer and trasmission extremely easy--any internet cafe will do. The quality of the pictures online is great although when I've printed them, I haven't been quite as pleased. Although the camera is a bit bulky, it isn't too much of a hastle to travel with and the rechargeable battery is a wonderful feature. In all, I highly recommend this camera for anything except prints--you can get decent 4 x 6 photos but the quality isn't what you'd like it to be. Just the same, it's a great camera with an outstanding zoom and enormous versatility."
5,great easy to use,"this camera is for any beginner, it's so easy to use anyone can figure it out. Takes incredible close ups. I'm certainly not disapointed w/it."
5,"easy as ,1,2,3",I ought this camera for its ease and quick response to be able to be used with floppy disks. This seems like a universal medium so as to print and trade pictures with family and friends. My wife loves the point and click and the simplicity of use. For the money this provides a high value for us.
1,Think twice,"On the plus side, this is a very easy camera to use. The 3.5"" floppy makes for speed and convenience. BUT... the negatives outweigh the positives with this camera. It is heavy and bulky (Mostly because of the floppy disk application). The pictures are coarse and grainy and not suitable for printing with ANY printer. It is necessary to focus this camera throught the LCD on the back and in bright sunlight, you can't see what you're trying to photograph. I also have an HP618 digital and there is no comparison, yet they sell for the same price. I am a believer in SONY products and own several, but they dropped the ball with this one. I'm sure that their higher end models are much more satisfactory, but I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I'm not a professional photographer, just a point and shoot guy, but this camera will disappoint you. Sorry SONY."
4,6 Years of World Travel with Mavica,I have been wandering the world for6 years. Andy the HoboTraveler.comI am on my second Mavica with 3.5 disk.The reason is the 10 Optical Zoom andthe 3.5 disk. This is the perfect camerafor making webpages while traveling.I can buy the disk in any underdevelopedcountry and use in an internet cafe.The 3.5 disk drive is a little fragile andyou should wait and not take photos too fastor you will damage the floppy.I have taken about 5000 photos with this camera.I use this camera to post the page or links tomy travel newslette. ...
2,FD75,"Great if you want an easy to use camera, and good value for money. However, I now own 5 mp camera and woouldn't go back. The FD75 is only 0.3 mp, and is ok until you want to enlarge pictures. The camera is great for kids to use at school, but I would not use it for those important occassions, when quality counts."
5,Sony MAVICA my Hero,I acquired one unit in 2002 in Nigeria....and I love The Common Sense Aspect of the Floppy Drive. I used it in Liberia during the War and my MAVICA got wounded....I took it to China in 2006 and got it Fixed....And right now my Hero is here with me Still Taking Pictures for my every day Needs.Sony Mavica ...you are my Hero !!!!
1,It's a no-no,"I can understand it you bought it in 2001 or before at that price. Now, it's a no-no for a 0.3mp camera at this price in 2003. Even if you only use pictures for web and it was 3 times cheaper, it was still not really a good choice. Memory is pretty cheap now. Who want to use floppy disks now? They may not be sold in stores soon."
2,Less than a megapixel,"Sure the floppy is great for ease of use, but do you want to spend three hundred dollars on a camera with a resolution of less than one megapixel? A floppy disk holds 1.44 megabytes, a 2.0 megapixel camera takes a picture that is about .9 megabytes."
5,Great product,"This is my first digital camera. It's terrific. I really like the fact that it uses floppy disks. Using default resolution I get 25-30 images per disk. No extra software, no cables, just put the disk in your floppy drive and use explore. Easy easy easy! And lets face it, if you forget to pack disks you can get them ANY where. The picture quality is good. The camera is very easy to use. If you are not a professional photographer, and just want to point and shoot vacation pics family stuff like most of us, you will NOT be disappointed by this camera. I like it."
1,Don't even think about it,"One of the pros is 10x optical zom but no matter how many pros (not so many,) no way to get a good picture from a 0.3MP camera. For email only, not printable. Too expensive too. You can get a much...much better Fujifilm camera w/ a lower price. You need at least 2MP to have a good (4x6) picture."
3,Some very zen moments,"Has zen moments and moments that fail to be zen. It seems like two authors have written the different chapters, one who is a zen master and the other who is Mr Wilson, Dennis the Menace's slightly crabby next door neighbor. For me, it was the contrast in the two personna's that provided the most enlightenment. Very thought provoking. Cannot help but improve your attitude toward the game and your fellow golfer."
2,Zen in the Art of Golf,"Well, here we go again...another golf book. Luckily I completed my golfing lifestyle perhaps twenty years back...when I had accumulated suffient strokes to last me for the rest of my life. This guy just can't quit. I hope he learns how someday!"
5,THIS IS REAL MUSIC!,"BEING A DEVOTED MINT FAN FOR YEARS, I'D RECOMMEND ALL R&B LISTENERS TO BUY IT AND IF ANYONE OUT THERE COULD TELL ME HOW I COULD GET THE CD REMIX OF, YOU SEND ME SWINGIN, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT."
4,A Definitive Mint Album,"A very enjoyable album to hear at a time when albums are not all that enjoyable to listen to anymore, especially in the realm of so-called ""R&B"". Give it up to the Mint for not only coming out in their now-trademark ""gumbo"" of musical styles, but for keeping to the tradition of true musicianship and originality. For those not familiar with the overall sound of the Mint, THIS is the album to buy first."
5,Classic R&B,"The second release from Mint Condition follows closely on the heels of their successful debut. Principal vocalist Stokely has good presence, projects sincerity and earnestness on love songs, and reflects Stevie Wonder's influence. The backing vocals, arrangements, lyrics and production style aren't overloaded with electronics, strings or any other devices, and they balance a traditional soul sensibility with a 1990s approach. Several numbers are enjoyable, none are overpowering or unremarkable. Sometimes they move into light funk or new jack, but Mint Condition is best at sentimental, breezy love material."
4,Good if not terribly challenging contemporary poetry,"If you start by accepting that hip-hop is the only truly living style of verse in America today, the bar is not terribly high for a book of contemporary, mostly American poetry. That being said, the poems here are notable first for being contemporary and second for being consistently high-quality, if not always ground-breaking. The range of experiences, class and ethnic backgrounds of the poets are what you might expect from a progressive NPR show- fairly broad but ultimately safe; the introductions also read predictably like NPR intros.The women poets supply some of the best material; maybe Bowman's ear is especially attuned to irony and pathos of a particularly female type. But most importantly this collection contains many fresh voices and avoids falling back into tired material such as beat writers, with the notable exception of Diane Di Prima."
5,Wish I'd read this when it came out!,"This is a great book. Well written. I just picked it up used, because I liked Ms. Casey's new book, ""A Warrant to Kill,"" so much. I wish I'd known about this one when it came out. I would have recommended it to friends. It's incredibly suspenseful. What this woman went through is terrifying. I've never thought about monsters like James Bergstrom having wives and girlfriends. How awful to fall in love, get married, and discover that you're married to a predatory animal. The guy is a real psycho. Amazing book!"
4,Excellent read!,Kathryn Casey offers an accurate & frustrating glimpse into the world of this abused & terrified wife who finally finds some justice...
3,An incredible story of a woman seeking justice,"The wife of James Bergstrom KNEW he was a rapist and fought repeatedly to get the police to arrest him. Time after time the criminal justice system simply walked away from their obligations to get and keep this man off the streets. Linda Bergstrom risked her life to do the right thing even though it seemed like no one else cared. She is my kind of hero! Pat Brown, Director/Investigative Criminal Profiler/The Sexual Homicide Exchange of Washington DC and Vicinity"
1,This is not a good album,"While searching for intelligent drum and bass, I picked-out this album from a list of searches. There is no reason to buy this album, unless you are looking for lite 80's non-pop. The songs are washed-out and unfamilliar. It is not at all one of my favorites."
5,A unique and much-needed book,"Ms. Keena's book offers a unique and empathetic aid to anyone struggling with adolescent depression--as caretaker or patient. For therapist, parent or the depressed adolescent herself, it provides both left-brained and right-brained perspectives on this often hereditary disease. By alternating between clinical observations from her current counseling work, and creative writings from her own teen years, Keena gives us a window into the mind of the clinically depressed, at times offering some gems of poetic expression as well as tools for understanding. She also inspires us by showing how she survived the sometimes fatal disease in order to live a productive and happy adulthood."
5,This thing works great!!!!,I got this for my birthday and have been happy with it's performance and ability to take my abuse. Most chargers I keep in the console get damaged from being knocked around but this one holds up really really well. I also like the cable because it is much easier to keep it from getting tangled than a straight one.
1,Does NOT work with Samsung Captivate,"FYI, this item does NOT work with the non-standard micro-USB slots on the Samsung Captivate. Do not buy for any of the Galaxy Class S phones."
2,It's an average boring childern's book,This book was really a load of rubish and I don't know why people have raved over it. It's boring and is really a book for quite a young age group. Half the characters in it are really dumb for their age. It's not very good at all.
5,A fantastic debut for this master storyteller.,This album is a must for any music fan with an I.Q. over 120
3,Flawed Randy,"Is this album a masterpiece? Absolutely not! But, as a first effort from Newman, it is witty, mordant, charming and self effacing all in one. Randy would continue to get better and better with each album(culminating in his early masterpiece SAIL AWAY).RANDY NEWMAN is a tad over orchestrated. Nevertheless many of the songs shine(like ""Davy the fat boy"") and already display Newman's skewed view of humanity, politics and culture. A songwriter's songwriter, Newman pulls off a credible debut."
1,Randy Newman,An absolute shocker. This CD went straight into the bin!How can anyone call this music?Doug Humby
3,Musically good,"This edition does not have subtitles, is in 16:9 letterbox, has Dolby 5.1 sound. Decent vocal and orchestral performance, bright video, and clear sound alleviate what some viewers may find a static, tedious production that emphasizes dancers' writhing bodies. Not all that much ""expressive truth"" here."
4,"Pretty nice, but...","i bought two of these and frankly I was dissapointed. I thought I will get all the six characters. The site does not specify how many toys are in the package. So I ordered two of them. I was surprised to see that I got only one toy in a package. And it was the same one! If I would have known there is just one toy included, I would've ordered different characters. Anyway, I got Cuddles and my favourite is Petunia.Overall, the toy is funny but the merchant is far from being professional."
3,"Nice camcorder, some disappointments","I have been using a Sony 8mm camcorder for a number of years. I bought this because my wife wanted a digital camera and I wanted to edit video on my computer.The digital editing has worked out well and it has been fun, once I got my firewire card to work right. The software that comes with it works adequately. I was disappointed in the video quality in low light situations. It gets very grainy compared to my old 8mm unless you turn on Nightshot, but then everything is a shade of green.The digital camera piece is also disappointing. The picture quality is very poor, though OK for my wife that prints mostly 2X3 inch pictures for scrapbooks. She went with this size because anything bigger looks bad. I do not like looking at the pictures on screen because of the poor quality.For the price I don't know that you can get any better and I still enjoy and use it, but the quality wasn't as good as I had hoped."
3,Don't buy this camera for stills if you want to print them,Buyer beware. The 640 X 480 pixel resolution of the still photos cannot be printed in an acceptable quality. I have been happy with the camcorder functions and the digital media is easy to work with but the poor still quality is a real problem for me.
2,"Looks great on paper, but failed my tests","For me this camera had the perfect mix of features so I picked it up to record my hiking adventures. First off the motor was so loud it was terrible (louder than my gal's voice in some scenes). I took it up Mt Timpanogos and discovered that not only was it too loud, but the 360 degree mic was overpowered by even the smallest breezes, and colors of flowers and plants got totally washed out in bright sunlight (can be corrected by a filter). The B&W viewfinder is useless (I couldn't make out a deer standing in shadow 20 meters away) and the LCD is hard to see in bright sun. It was also way too heavy to carry in a pack all day. In low light conditions it gets very grainy (to be expected, but not to this degree). I returned it and now am trying a DCRTRV17. Same mic and LCD but with a color VF, much smaller and lighter (DVC), a super quiet motor, but only 10x op-zoom."
2,Too Many Better Choices Out There.,"I already own the extremely small JVC GR-DVP3U and was looking for a good second camera. I needed something larger for more recreational use.. The features that caused me to buy this unit where the Sony name, large LCD and the fact that the digital8 format would allow me to still dubb and play my Hi8 and 8mm tapes. I took for granted that the images would be crystal clear and the capabilities would be as expected in 2002. Howver, I will be returning this camera within my alloted 30 days. The low light capabilities are non-existant. I tried filming in my living room with 3 lights on and the images were worse than my old 8mm Viewcam. Outside in bright light if operates fine. Still images are pathetic! This is not Sony's best work. look elsewhere."
2,drawbacks galore!,...Comfort and user friendliness is important to me and this just didn't have it. The zoom function was difficult to control and it was hard to reach the zoom button on top of the camcorder and it just didn't feel right to move the lever left to right as opposed to front and back. The viewfinder was only B+W. My Sony Cam from '91 felt more ergonomically correct than this unit. Glad the TRV530 is discontinued. The TRV117 is a much better choice.
3,"very good picture, pathetic built-in mic","I'm very happy with the image quality presented by this camera. The built-in mic, however, is quite sad. It picks up the buzzing of the camera when recording. This is especially annoying during quiet moments, but it can still be heard even when there are other environmental sounds.Will a external mic fix this problem? Guess I'll have to shell out around 80.00 Sony dollars to find out.As noted by others here in the reviews, the digital still picture component of the camcorder is useless (but taking digital still pics is not the reason to buy this camera - - moving into the digital video recording/editing realm is).Also, it is true that the picture quality degrades quickly under minimal lighting conditions (more so than my previous analog Cannon Hi8).A decent camera, overall. I hope to be more on the positive side once I start editing video with it."
3,Excellent Digital Camera,"Excellent, digital and optical zoom. Special efects wonderfull. I would be great better resolution for taking pictures."
1,VERY disapointing - this camcorder [is bad]!,"I recently bought the 530 some time ago and let me tell you it was the biggest mistake of my life.I am so happy this camcorder is discontinued because it won't make others as angry as it made me.First off, the digital stills are laughable. VERY WEAK!The camera is bulky. I can't even get my finger to rest confortably on the zoom. I end up holding the damn thing with two hands!Okay, the optical zoom is good (that's where it gets ONE star from me). However, the digital zoom is so awful that its pointless that its even there.Picture is very grainy at times when seen on my TV. This had my family very disapointed as I was filming my first born's first few steps. I was REALLY angry.This camcorder was a bust for Sony and I'm glad they threw it out.I will be getting the MINI DV soon."
5,Wonderful for all ages!,"My 6 year old loves this book. Much of the content will be current and relavant as he gets older and while he may not understand everything now he certainly enjoys it. The book is great for all ages and I have learned quite a bit. Of his library of braille books, this is his absolute favorite!"
3,"Good Instruction, minimum difficulty","This video does not really focus on a specific dance (Waltz, foxtrot, etc), but rather instructs dance steps for all occasions and slow music types. If you want to learn a specific dance, I suggest one Cal Pozo's other videos (I liked Salsa Merengue video). The instruction is good and at a beginner level. Professional set & dancers. 50 minutes. Swing dance instruction is basic steps and not too athetlic (Lindy style). Enough to get started though."
2,"very, very, very simple","I purchased this tape and shortly thereafter began dance lessons. Everything Cal covered was covered in the 1/2 hour of the first lesson. Although you are offered a good intro in the tape, it never goes past the very basics of the dance."
2,Forget about this tape. Go for something else !!,"I purchased a copy of Carl Pozo's Vol Two - Swing & Slow dances which was available in CD in my country and quite frankly, I was confused as the steps introduced are too basic with only two variations or so per dance. It turned out as I watched further, that he was teaching the Waltz steps which look 'unfamiliar' in my many years of dancing. Subsequently, I think he did the American Tango steps, again it was too basic to be of any use.I would pass it on to someone else ."
5,Great Product,"Few months ago I went to the hairsalon, and the lady did a horrible job ony hair. She burned my hair so bad that I started to be bold all over. I was looking for a natural product that would help regrow my hair and bring it to life again. I have been using this amazing product for few weeks now and my hair is definatley growing again and it's not dry at all. My hair is soft and it's not that dry as it used to be. It's amazing and I will buy it again."
1,Shedding,Did not work for me. I have been using this for 2 months. My hair shed more than before. I kept reading all the review it work for others but not for me.
4,Long Healthy Hair,"I haven't noticed any increase in thickness, but I was at the end of my rope with my dry, chemically processed hair and this was a last ditch effort before I cut it all off! My hair is soft, compared the the straw like consistency before using this.My hair dresser noticed right away that I was using something different. I have maintained a long style of hair with this porduct and I have acne prone skin so I like that I have not had any increased breakouts on my hair line from this. I massage into my scalp only 2 a week to begin with and now once a week. I usually do it the night before and sleep with it and wash it out before I have to go to work."
4,Nice Oil!,"I have been using this oil as a pre-poo for about 4 wks, and I must say that I feel that my hair has thickened some what. It leaves a tingly feeling on my scalp for about an hour, but nothing unpleasant. Does have a very strong smell, so be advised to use this at night and follow next day with shampooing. Please follow directions...will purchase again."
4,Well I was unsure at 1st,"NICE PRODUCT! IT DOES EXCACTLY WHAT THE OTHER COMMENTS SAID. I HAD A BALD SPOT IN THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND HAIR THINNING. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS FROM MY DIABETES, STRESS, OR FROM MY FAMILY TRAIT. I JUST KNOW ITS GONE AND MY HAIR IS GETTING THICK AGAIN LIKE IT WAS WHEN I WAS A CHILD."
4,Great massage oil,"If you can handle the scent of this oil which is not bad once it settles, it is great to massage the scalp with. I like this for a pre-oil treatment before I wash my hair."
4,nice conditioner,This make my hair nice and soft. I haven't used it long enough to see if it will thicken my hair - which is why I bought it..
3,Not For Me,"I ordered this oil in high hopes that it would make my hair grow due to what was stated in the reviews that I read. I used this as a scalp massage once or twice a week. After massaging my scalp, I would let it sit over night or for an hour before washing. I experienced some shedding from this oil which was not normal for me. I am african american with relaxed hair. I immediately through it out due to the constant shedding i experienced.""Everything that works for me may not work for you"". I remember that quote and now I believe it."
4,"good quality, but dilute","This oil met my expectations. It's a good quality,though not as concentrated as I would prefer. At this price, that's to be expected. Good value overall."
4,Most depressing album of the year.,"I love this album. It's very sparse and acoustic (the Mick Moss tracks at least.) There is a great cover of Trouble's Mr. White, taken to new depths of sorrow and doom. If you need an album to listen to while at your lowest, this is it. Duncan Patterson left the band after the recording of this, but judging from the strength of the Mick Moss penned tracks the band will carry on with no problems. Half of the tracks here are written and performed by Duncan, and the other half by Mick. So, fans of Duncan's work in Anathema will be pleased, and hopefully like Mick's songs just as much if not more. Highlights include ""The Weight of the World,"" ""Mr White"" and ""A Portrait of the Young Man as an Artist."""
1,So sad,"Harrison can tell a great story, Manhattan Nocturne and Bodies Electric are terrific, but the Havanna Room simply blows polar bears. The first ten pages are great, they suck you into the story, but like the main character's life, the rest of the book unravels into a bizzare and untenable story line. I could forgive all that if the book would have been at least entertaining, but it wasn't. The worst part about the story was what actually happens in the Havanna Room. It's as much a dissappointment as the rest of the book. I'd pass."
3,"not all bad, just disappointing","when I picked up this book and read the first few chapters I was enchanted, the 1st few pages were so well written, they were almost perfection.After Wyeth's downfall though, the book just fell apart. the Havana room ""secret"" was ridiculous as was the wine property ""secret"" which bordered on improbability.in spite of all this the book did keep me coming back for more, though at one point I was pretty mad at the author for destroying what could have been one of the best books of the decade.the first couple of chapters are so good though that I reccomend reading up until he has his first lunch at the Havana room, and then putting it down and imagining the rest of the story yourself."
1,A disappointment,"I loved Bodies Electric, Harrison's first book. Each one since I have loved less. This one I didn't even like. I read all the way to the end, hoping, I guess for some revelation that would surprise me. Instead, it started with an improbable concept - a guy who has been fired from his high-powered job, is basically bankrupt, and has no hopes of working for any real money again, decides to eat an an expensive steak house every single day. Why? Because the author needed him there to meet other characters and get the plot lumbering forward. Then you take more unlikely scenarios - an addiction like none you've ever heard of, a character whose sickness seems to wax and wane when it's called for by the plot, a bizarre suicide method - and what you are left with is an over-written mess that never surprises."
4,Decent Literary Thriller,"I liked THE HAVANA ROOM overall, but I must admit it's not for everybody. If you're looking for a realistic plot or likable characters, this novel will probably let you down. I didn't find this book particularly suspenseful, and I must admit I found some of the plot developments completely unbelievable.However, the prose of this novel is remarkably well crafted. Colin Harrison is without question a gifted writer. The narrator of THE HAVANA ROOM, a 40-year old lawyer who has hit bottom, ruminates constantly about aging, the meaning of love, and other important life issues. These ruminations are very interesting to read. I suspect many middle aged men will identify with the themes presented in this novel.I don't recommend this book if you're looking for a fast-paced thriller. But if you're looking for a literary/thriller hybrid, this is one of the better ones out there."
4,Another Winner From Harrison,"Colin Harrison keeps turning out page turners. This is a rather unusual story of how a very successful lawyer loses his position,his wife and his son as a result of accidentially poisoning a young guest at a birthday sleepover party. Then strange twists develop involving a promising former baseball rookie who was coincidentally also poisoned-- by herbicides--his(the baseball players)quest to make contact with his daughter, major real estate transactions, a violent rap type club owner,and the goings on at a private room of an old steak house where things seem to come together. Story is basically told as a narrative. It works."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See book summary above.This will not rank as one of my favorite Harrison novels. As one reviewer notes its more a literary thriller. Plenty of prose here. Once you develop compassion for the protagonist it gets a little better, but overall I still think its a little over-written, though at the same time well-written (this might only make sense to me). Not something I'd read over again."
1,SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AFTER FIRST 50 PAGES,"Havana Room started with an explosive, accidental death that could happen in the home of all of us. The resulting downward spiraling of the main character's life was stunningly sudden and believable. It seemed like we had the makings of another Bonfire of the Vanites where one wrong turn, one wrong decision, and everything can fall in on us all at once. Regretably, that's the highlight of this thoroughly absurd tale of characters one more wretched than the next. It was silly and repetitive with no character seemingly deserving of redemption or reconciliation."
3,Great Start,"For the first third of this book I thought I had found one of those magical times when I read slowly to savor the writing and the mood. The characters were mysterious and I could not wait see the unraveling. Unfortunately, things turned very ordinary, even pitiful. Stock character and stereotypes began to act in predictable ways. Ultimately so disappointing."
3,Good Print but not a good movie,I liked the quality of the video a lot but the movie itself is not good. I would not suggest this movie to anybody. I think I watched this movie as I am a Deepika fan.
1,Horrible movie.,This movie blew chunks. It was utter rubbish. Pure crap.Even the hot Indian chick couldn't make this movie bareable to watch.
5,Finally: The Sky Is NOT Falling!,"This is the first book related to prophecies for the year 2000 & beyond that I have read that is not a panicked ""911"" message. There are suggested ""remedies"" using positive energy, prayers and affirmations in the book that make a lot of sense and are easy to do. (The astrology is not overwhelming and gloomy.) After reading this book, you feel like you can do something POSITIVE for the world besides worry & wonder what's going to happen."
3,"""Know that you Know your own Truth","Having never read any of Elizabeth's books before, and being relatively aware of St Germaine and his wondrous work on this planet, this book jumped out at me. Yes, I agree with the other reviewees, that it is a helpful book to enable us to 'relax' somewhat and know that all is indeed not doom and gloom. Power to the people could never be as important at this time that we are presently in. However, there is a group of chapters which I would have to whole heartedly disagree with and if I didn't know any better, they appear to have an agenda behind them.The Child's Perspective and a few of the following chapters from this one I personally found quite alarming in their content. There is no greater truth than your own, so take care when reading some of this, because at the end of the day it is only an opinion. Don't be afraid to feel and if all of her words ring true for you fantastic, but if they don't this is because this is Elizabeth's truth and not your own."
4,Nephew loved this!,My 4 year old nephew loved this! It's not meant to be used as a toy like an action figure but he loves bobbing its head.
5,Great novelty,"I couldn't find this anywhere on the shelves in any of the stores, so I was really happy to see it listed here. It's a great gift and definitely worth giving or having."
3,Dark force in a toy!,"I was expecting something better, I mean, a bit more detailed, but I guess this is what I would get for that price!"
5,Speaking Truth,"My husbands' National Guard unit was assigned to Battery Park after the World Trade Center attack, and he met Ms. Ghent where she was donating her CD's to people who were working the site. Against this backdrop, her song ""Truth"" was particularly moving. Although it was about the carnage that Stalin committed against his own people, the haunting refrain, ""Truth crushed to the earth will rise again"" could apply to any of the horrendous acts that humans commit in the name of religion or ideology, and the capacity of mankind to rise above evil. The album has a fine variety of musical styles and thoughtful ideas that will please and sometimes disturb but never bore."
2,Sandy and not very tasty,"These clams from China are very sandy and I don't care for the taste either. Don't get me wrong -- I like clams and I have had excellent canned smoked clams from another brand in the past. Honestly, I was expecting more flavor and less sand. I could go on but why?"
1,Horrible service at Amazon.com,"I never wanted to write one of these, but I feel I have to. I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price. This is something that any dime store would do, but apparently one of the world's largest online retailers couldn't. This is very disappointing, and I would never recomend this company to anyone....ever....quite the opposite."
2,IMITATION....,Item is not authentic. Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole.
5,Love These Boots!,"Awesome looking and very comfortable, be sure to get a size smaller than you normally would wear. I wear a 13, but ordered a 12 based on other reviewers, and they fit perfectly. I wear these with jeans on casual Friday's at work all the time."
4,Great Boots For The Price!,"I've read reviews on Kenneth Cole Shoes being large for their size. Guess what? It's true. They're about half or even one size larger than stated. If you're interested in purchasing a pair, I would recommend that you purchase one size smaller. I actually wear men's size 7. I purchased a pair of size 7 Kenneth Cole Reaction (Team Circle) boots. They're about one size larger. With a pair of thick cotton socks, it fits perfectly. Made in China, great style, nice quality leather, good craftmenship and best of all, great $59.90 free shipping price tag. If it wasn't for the size issue, I would definitely give it 5 stars or 2 thumbs up!!!!!!!!."
4,Very nice boots,"I just got these boots today and I'm excited about them. They look a bit bulkier than expected but they are light and stylish. The one gripe I have about them is that they aren't zip up as I expected them to be. In any event, its a great boot."
3,Still listening,"I bought this because I read of Myaskovsky in my reading about Shostakovich. OK, but I have only listened a few times. I still have to get used to his style. Worth trying."
4,Great product,"I bought 4 of these probably 2 years ago. All 4 are still working great. The surface (non-flashlight) lights are dimmer than typical old-fashioned night lights, but that hasn't bothered me. The flashlight capability is pretty laughable, but to be honest you're probably just going to use the light to try to figure out where you left your real flashlight (or to light a few candles). It may sound like I'm being negative, but these really are great products that do exactly what I'd expect. The only reason I'm leaving this review is because I'm going to order a few more for the house for those few other places where I wish I had the same light."
5,As bright as u need it to be!,"I noticed a cool feature that I don't think ayone else mentioned. If your house has lights on faders, then you'll notice too that this little light fades up and down proportionally to how bright the surrounding area is! Meaning: as u turn down your lights, the emergency light gets brighter. Nifty!"
2,Not recommended,"I really didn't like this product.Here is why:- Flimsy switch. Hard to set in the ""Emergency light"" position.- Poor battery. Let it charging overnight and unplugged it in the morning. It was totally discharged the next morning. It can't even hold the charge 1 day (!?)- Light is too weak. The Flashlight mode is half decent. The Emergency Light mode is comparable to a small candle lighting a room (but white).So please keep looking and don't waste your money as I did."
3,OK nightlight & flashlight but blocks 2nd outlet,"It works ok as a night light & flashlight, but it blocks the second outlet when plugged in. There's a similar priced light that does all this one does, and doesn't block the second outlet: ""E-light: LED Emergency Light, Night Light, Flashlight, AAA Charger"""
2,Greenlite,doesnt lite up when lights go out as it says it will. very dissapointed as i gave it for a gift
3,Inexpensive emergency and night light.,"This emergency and night light is a bit unusual in that the night light stays on all the time, the nightlight bulbs are 2 bright white LED lights. It works out great for my hallways where I do not mind the white light but may be a bit bright for a bedroom. As a flashlight it is just bright enough for an emergency (pathetic as a flashlight). If it lasts as long as prior reviewers have stated then I will be very satisfied but it is a China made product so who knows. So far I say it is a buy. I gave it 3 of 5 stars because it is a strange nightlight, the flashlight is just adequate and I do not know if it will last."
3,"adequate but cheap feel, harsh light","This product is adequate and performs as described. However, it has a ""cheap"" plastic feel to it and the nightlight is a rather harsh, white light (with red indicator light, too). My daughter didn't want it in her room (prefers a softer regular nightlight) and I don't blame her. We bought 2 and they both ended up the hallway outside bedrooms. That'll do in an emergency, though."
3,Okay for the money,not a very bright nightlight nor a very bright flashlight but will suffice for what i need -- something to assist in getting to the good flashlight -- in the event of a power failure.
2,Must use as nightlight if also using as emergency light,"We ordered these planning to use them as emergency lights, but you can only use them as emergency lights if you also decide to use them as nightlights (one button selects both features). Great if you want them for both, but didn't fit our need."
4,works well,"A few weeks ago, I ordered three and they are all working well. I put them in two hallways and the basement. The light output is enough to let you see where you are going, but not so bright as to be annoying at night. When you first turn out the lights and these kick in, they seem dim, but after your eyes adjust a bit, they seem to be just the right amount of illumination. They are defnitely not floodlight-style backup lights like you would see in a commerical stairwell, but they suit my needs well.They seem a bit inexpensively made, but you aren't paying a fortune for them either. They do seem to make the adjacent socket a close fit for another electrical plug, but not bad."
4,Great In An Emergency,"I have mixed reviews for odd reasons. My first three were perfect. That was 2 years ago. Recently I ordered an additional 3 and only 1 was working so I had to send the other 2 back.Biggest general problem is that depending on your outlets, they can cover both plugs so you can't put anything else there.Best thing is that after 2 years we finally had a power outtage at night and I got to see how bright these really were. Couldn't believe the great light they threw. I was glad they were in my bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. I recommend these lights BUT, I believe from other reviews AND my latest experience, the products can be irregular and not work properly when you order them.As I stated before I have 3 from two years ago and they work perfectly.The merchant is refunding my money from the latest purchase without an objection and they were packaged beautifully. Can't imagine why a brand new product doesn't work, not 1 but 2 in the same order......."
5,Good product,"This night light works well for lighting at night without being too bright for sleep, and the emergency light provides security in case of a power failure. A good investment for anyone who is afraid of falling when getting up during the night."
5,Awesome combination product. Better than Timex version.,"This little (inexpensive) item does a lot. First of all it is a rechargable LED flashlight you leave hanging in an outlet so it is always charged. It is an ""ok"" flashlight.If you slide the switch to nightlight, it is an automatic nightlight (comes on when the room is dark). In this mode the light will also come on when the power goes out. In a blackout your nightlights will automatically kick on.This one is better than the nearly identical timex model. The nightlight on this brand is white, instead of amber. Also, the exterior is more plain and looks better on the wall.Tough to beat this thing for $12."
3,little size... weak light,"The size is small... the battery is great! but the light is very weak... not bright enough to illuminate a small room.Lámpara pequeña... con buena batería, pero no da mucha luz... (sólo lo suficiente para no tropezarse)."
1,Exploded,When I received this unit I plugged it in and noticed the nightlight came on even though the room was bright. I checked the switch settings and plugged it back in. It exploded. I won't be buying another one.
2,"Eh, not that great...","LED lights not very bright. Not good for interior security/emergency light, not bright enough to deter burglars...This is only good for a kids room."
5,Great for anyone,"This is a great ""preppers"" product. It lights your way at night and when there is no electricity, it becomes a flashlight. Cool. Bought one for my in-laws now will buy one for us and a few more for them."
2,Youth...Ten-year Gap...HEA,"The story was written in the early 90s, published 1992.Jenny Monroe is 17, a month away from 18. She is the daughter of the family that is the top of the socio-economic stratosphere of the small town.Mitch Sullivan...the Hell-raiser of the title. 26, works as an auto mechanic saving money to head off to Europe and become a writer. He already has some articles published, so this is not a pipe-dream. (What is the etymology of pipe-dream, anyway?)I wanted to love this book, even though the H/H were so dang young. I got 1/2 way through, and was still holding out hope...then the misunderstanding happened, and I skimmed through to the end. I really liked Mitch, and Jenny was sweet...but, it just wasn't enough.I generally love a Dallas Schulze book...even the older SIM titles. My favorite being Secondhand Husband. This one just didn't pan out for me.M"
1,not worth the savings,The ADC replacement lamps for the Welch Allyn pocket opphthalmoscope is totally worthless as it gives a field of light that is half-moon shaped and totally unacceptable to use.I had to return all the ADC replacement lamps and exchange for the OEM WA-03900 lamps instead.
1,Bad Quality!,"My bulb came as expected, I was very pleased, but Oh my surprise, after turning on my othoscope, 3 seconds later, the bulb exploted!. Not recommended!"
2,making buddhism inaccessible,An extremely difficult and tedious read. Treats scholastic Buddhism in all its technicality. THe author comes across as a real curmudgeon. Very unenjoyable.
1,Broken Gear after I barely used it,I barely used this tripod when it wouldnt extend properly. Turns out a gear inside had two broken teeth. The gear looks like it is not made out of a strong material. Of course the tripod is out of warranty so they won't fix it.So don't bother with Vanguard products because something as simple as a tripod is easily broken.
1,not what i expected,this did not massage as much as it vibrated. you could barely feel the heat or the vibrations through the cover. totally not what was advertised or what i expected...it was a gift and i was very disappointed in it.
1,This is more of a vibration/pulse pad than massage,I was hoping this would be an MASSAGE chair.. it has a pulse and a vibration-But the heat is nice and warm ! I will be sending this back.
5,Original horror with plenty of twists and turns!,"This is a very smart and original horror film that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The fractured narrative works really well, ensuring that your brain is engaged throughout. Fans of intelligent horror will appreciate this film, and there is also plenty of great visual gore and unexpected scares. As a horror writer I found the film inspiring as well as entertaining. Also great to see Edward Furlong shine in this - the role suits him perfectly - very smart casting. Definitely one to watch!"
3,A bit disappointed...,"I didn't expect much from ""Below Zero"" and I didn`t get much.I found it quite boring.But I have to say it`s a unique movie.I love Edward Furlong which is why I had to get this one-The story seems to be so interesting, but the movie itself just didn`t ""get me""The ending was very confusing...If you`re a fan of Edward Furlong you should see it,otherwise don`t."
5,In Love and War,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister, she loves all Sandra Bullock movies. Needless to say she is very happy with ths one too."
4,I liked it,It was a pretty good movie. i love Sandra Bullock in any movie. She is such a great actress. Thank you.
2,"dull, Bullock couldn't save it","I've become an admirer of Sandra Bullock, so I've been trying to see all the films where she had a major role... Yet I just couldn't watch ""In Love and War"" all the way through. It just lacks energy. Bullock looked pretty in the nurse's outfit . . . but somehow she looked out of place. I've read the five star reviews rhapsodizing about this movie, and I find myself wondering if I watched the same film. My advice would be to skip buying it and rent it if you absolutely must. But if you want to see Bullock in an overlooked movie in which she shines, I'd recommend ""Love Potion #9."""
5,Moving,"This is a truly moving story of a young man comming of age and his experiences with one of the most dramatic periods of his life. Having read the book ""A Farewell To Arms"" I think the portrayal of the mood in this movie, along with the performances closely lived up to my expectations as an incredibly critical reader."
3,Sweet but forgettable.,"In Love and War is a sweet romantic drama but there are some flaws in this epic love story. Sandra Bullock and Chris O'Donnell have wonderful and natural chemistry but the story seems inaccurate and forced. O'Donnell plays doomed writer Ernest Hemingway and I just felt like the part was too big for him, he tried to make it his own and he failed. Bullock saves this film, she is an unappreciated actress, good film just weak aim."
2,Just not enthralling enough to keep the interest of viewers.,"While watching In Love and War, one will most surely get up many times and leave the room to do something else, preferably something tie consuming. A no-no by many accounts, the attempt by Richard Attenborough to recount the story of Ernest Hemingway and his love affair with a WWI nurse starts as something promising. Yet, the promise is broken in the first four minutes, and the viewer is left to dwindle among the every-so-long plot, which seems to have no sense of balance. While the movie may be accurate as far as the real story goes, it is certainly not entertaining enough. The actors do what they can to contribute emotion and gumption into their characters, yet this, along with well-designed sets and scenery, is not enough to give moviegoers what they want. Only for solid fans of Bullock and/or O'Donnell, and no one else."
4,Well done despite historical inaccuracies,"Curiosity after reading ""A Farewell to Arms"" led to the diaries of Agnes von Kurowsky and ultimately to Sir Attenborough's film. The fact that the film takes some liberties with the actual timeline of the story (Agnes' assignments, her non-existent reunion with Hemingway in Missouri), the film itself was heartbreakingly beautiful. Chris O'Donnell did a fine job as the young Ernest Hemingway, but I wonder why the vibrant, flirtatious Aggie was played with such serious somberness by Sandra Bullock? The Agnes we read about in the book was indeed a serious and committed nurse, but her personality was the polar opposite of the film portrayal. This is not to say that Sandra Bullock is a bad actress - I just think the direction for her character was wrong.Ernest Hemingway clearly loved Agnes von Kurowsky with a passion that could only be fulfilled on the written page. For both parties involved, the timing of the love affair was ill-fated."
3,"No blockbuster, but viewable","People shouldn't pay too much attention to professional critics; sometimes one wonders about their agenda, not to mention their cynicism. I'm not impressed by Chris O'Donnell so far in anything he's done. ""Robin"" seems to be his high point. Sandra Bullock, on the other hand, graces anything in which she cares to appear. The lady brings a ""real people"" effect to her roles. We'll see her accepting that little gold statue one of these years. The film isn't any blockbuster; as a war movie, it's fair. As a romance flick, it's OK. As a commentary on Hemingway, O'Donnell isn't the one to bring life to the crusty, alcoholic, arrogant, would-be patriarch (if he could stay family-oriented long enough) that was ""Papa"" Ernest. Not bad cinema, just kind of mediocre. Without Sandy Bullock, however, it would be pretty seedy."
2,The critics were terribly mistaken!!!,"This movie lacked truly experienced actors in serious, and romantic roles. Sure Chris and Sandra have starred in romantic movies, but they are unoriginal, and just like the next. Chris O'Donnell was the last person who should have been picked for the role of such a noteworthy and distinguished American author. This movie puts Ernest Hemmingway to shame. Which is a complete disaster. Where was the build-up of true love? This movie bounced from one scene to the next, without ever convincing me Agnes and Ernest were truly in love. This movie did not deserve the accolades it received from the critics. It has the potential to be excellent, if there were different actors in the roles of Agnes and Ernest. It had the potential to be good if it hadn't been so ""Hollywood-ized."" If you're interested in Ernest Hemmingway's life, read ""A Farewell to Arms."" It's far better."
3,It was a wonderfully acted and moving film.,This was definitely a movie made for romantics. I loved it and would recommend it to all. The actors did a wonderful job of portraying this movie based on a real life story. Everyone should see this movie.
1,I Would Have Given It No Stars,"I recently rented this video about two days ago and let me say that this was a horrible movie. Bullock tries to hard to become a caring nurse but turns out to be a unemotional and untouching female. The friendships are unrealistic for that time period and so is the love affair.There was some interesting parts in the beginning but they ended up dissolving by the first ten mins. The book is so much better and should be read before you listen to my opinoin. Please turn to the literature and not to this lifeless movie. This movie has a good point though, it will not stick to you after you are done watching it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!!,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I personally would not make my worst enemy watch this.
4,Great little camera,I bought this cxamera while stationed in Korea. I own a Macintosh also. This camera allowed me to take video footage and import it to my computer. I would then edit it and re-record it back onto the camera. I would either send the movies out over e-mails or put them onto a DVD disk or record then onto a regular VHS. The camera has been in Korea then back to the US and then over to Afghanistan. Because it has held up to all of that I give it a 4 star review. This camera has had no problems what so ever. I did buy a larger battery for it. It now records forever before the battery dies. You may also want a larger memory stick if you want to buy one also. I have the 4MB and it holds 32 pictures. A 16MB would do fine for everday pictures. The resolution is only 640 x 480. It is not made for taking pictures but more for recording. I hope this review helps someone out.
1,Don't touch it with a bargepole,This Digicam sulks..I used it for < 2years and it has gone kaput. When I reported this to the Sony Service center they asked for $300 repair cost. They are living in anachronistic times when they quoted this sky high rate. You can get a new one (and that too the latest model ) for a little more than $300.
4,What a Zoom!,"I recently took my brand new camera to a big trip to Europe and I had no trouble using it, very easy and very good. There are two things I would improve (1) It is a little heavy to be carried around for over a month, a little bulky also; (2) I specially did not liked the nightshoot, the pictures come out in B/W and with a type of sepia-green color, which is very bad in the case of museums and churches where what you want is living color. Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the delivery vs. price."
4,"Great camera, just takes a little time","I almost returend the camera but the salesman was helpfull(the owners manual could use some help though). He explained to me how to work the still feature. My still photos were comming out very grainy. Do not use the zoom feature on the stills, that was where my problem was. All in all the camera is easy to use and very light weight compared to the old dinosaur we previously owned(also a Sony 10yrs and still going strong). I am looking forward to using the camera this summer on all of our outings and sport events..... FUN, Fun, FUN"
1,Durability is terrible,"Bought this camera less than 2 years ago and I thought it was pretty good, except the digital part. Terrible pictures, it isn't worth the extra $$. However, the camera recently broke, despite extremely mild usage. The camera will no longer close with a cassette inside. I now know that this defect is fairly common, but an expensive repair. I'm looking for a different camera, different brand. Sony has a quality problem."
1,Problems -- do not buy!!!,"Numerous reports of camera stopping (type DCR trv38 and problem in google and you'll see what I mean) . The screen goes blank and that's the end of your DCR. Costs about $300 to repair. Reports from 2 months to 2 years usage and not linked to how often used or how treated. It is a problem with the ""board"" and your camera WILL die it's just a matter of when. It happened to us and we are thinking it was just us. We're buying a new DCR and you can bet it won't be a SONY even if they gave us one--they are too unreliable."
4,"Good product, room for improvement within the price range","Its a great camera for the money. However, I was surprised that there is no carry-case with it. The auto power off is a good feature to save battery, but if you have a tape inserted and you wanted to use it as a PC camera ... its bit annoying that it shuts itself off after few minutes! If a power cord is plugged in, and the camera definitely can sense that, then why not keep an option of deactivating auto power off! And the 700X digital zoom, sounds great, but I haven't been able to use it properly yet."
5,"Looking for Deep, Thought Provoking SiFi?","THIS ISN'T IT! But if you're looking for a good romp through space with a quasi-vigilante, Jame Bond sort of character, you will thoroughly enjoy this material. An excellent read when you just want to have some fun!"
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"This is a book I've read and re-read and re-read numerous times. I enjoyed this book very much. So much so that I took the ""handle"" Stainless Steel Rat on the first BBS I was on (1984) and some ""hacker"" buddies still call me ""Rat"" to this day...I recommend this book to any and all sci-fi readers. The later books weren't always as good as this trilogy - this should be the starting point for any future ""Rats.""In short: GET THIS BOOK!"
3,"A good, fun, book, but nothing great","I regard ""Adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat"" as a good, fun, book, but nothing great.This book is a good read, period.This was the second book of the series that I read. Already, it was getting a little bit boring."
3,A Decent Romp,"This paperback omnibus collects the first three volumes of the nine volume (so far) Stainless Steel Rat series: ""The Stainless Steel Rat,"" ""The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge,"" and ""The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World."" Never having read any of this legendary space cowboy series, I found that a little of this stuff goes a long way. The stories feature a charming rouge con-man who gets turned into an agent for the elite Special Corps. The first story is fun and mindless, the second is still fun, but by the end of it I was wondering if the formula was to be repeated in the third, which it was. There are some fun moments to be had, but this is writing by the numbers."
3,Not the best but still a fun recording,"With 18 different cast recordings of the show I would be the fist to admit that Cats is german is a little weird. This is one of two german cast recordings out.(The other one is a Live double disk recording.) If you like the show then I would get it just for the novelity. It has a few good voices,but the orchestera is small and sorta bland. Out of all the recordings I have this is around the bottom of the lot,but still cute and fun. If you can find the other German it's much better."
3,A cat is not a dog,"Katzen sind nicht Huendlein? This didn't quite make it through the translation. I like the show in English and know it fairly well. I bought the recording to hear early Ute Lemper. Zehr interessant. That was her on Erinnerung? On a leash. The snort at the beginning of Der Rum Tum Tugger is funny and well done. Some good verve from the performers. Shouldn't ""Rumpelteaser"" be translated too, since the names are supposed to be funny?! The sound of German was usually more cacophanous than feline. Very amusing - and not as bad as the reviews on the German Amazon website make it sound. Not nearly as good as the English recording. Not a dog, but it ain't Eliot. TS."
3,ummmmmm,"just a thought, but this track listing seems a tad off. i'd laugh if this were an actual shoutbus album... or maybe i'd just be terrified."
1,Only for school kids,"This book only has the basics of the basics, you may retain about 5 ideas after reading it. There is nothing about filing notes, nothing about notes in the IT era, there is no ""philosophy"" (ie: nothing about the role notes play as a specific form of text). In the information era you expect something better on notes!"
1,No good.,"I regret I bought it. Even Wikipedia offers a better text on note taking, for free. Disappointed."
1,"Vinyl used, not new","buy a new disk and sent me a vinyl used and in poor condition, you are not professional"
1,Faulty,I picked one of these up to clean up my mess of wires and manage my accessories. Sadly only switch number 1 functions. Whilst I can hear the other switches toggle on and off I checked them with the volt meter and got a null reading. The first switch works terrificly sadly the rest don't so I'm rating this 1 out of 5.
4,So far so good,"So far it is working great with my project. I did install a master switch to avoid accidentally leaving some of the switches in the ON position. The switches do not have indicators that will let you know if they are on by just looking at the switches. Once I turn on the master switch, I can turn on the equipment I need with the touch pad."
4,4 way gel panal switch,I am happy with this product it preforms well the only thing I wish it had was a lighted gel pad other then that I would recommend it to others to check it out.
1,Outdated and Irrelevant,"Based upon the first review, I went to our local law library to use the book for a note that I am writing. I was very disappointed. The book is currently out-of-date, irrelevant and, to my mind, poorly conceived."
5,Solo,I love this group. Their are harmonies were tight. I don't know what they are doing now but please come back. For me this cd is just wonderful. I love to listen to people who can really sing unlike a lot of groups today.
5,Hidden in my Heart,"My Mom used to run a daycare in her home and she would constantly play these songs for the kids during the day, and for us as well. I grew to love them - and must admit, I still do. Now that I am a mother myself, I love to play them for my son, and even use them in junior choir at church!It is a great way to learn scripture and all the songs have a nice tune that is easy to remember and hide in your heart!"
5,Second Generation,"My mom played these songs for us when we were little and we'd sing them constantly. Even today when I read a scripture that was on this CD, the song is still in my head to help me remember. Now, I have a daughter of my own and I will be teaching her to sing these scriptures as well! I would highly recommend this CD to any parent wanting to teach their children the Word of God."
5,A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO YOUR KIDS DEVOTION TIME!!,"We added this CD to our devotion time after learning about it from Heart of Dakota, and my kids (3 and 5 yrs old) absolutely love it!!! After we read our devotion, I find the song that goes with the verse and it really takes the verse home. They literally start clapping and dancing, so cute! Its so rewarding to see my kids not only enjoying their devotion time, but actually singing Gods word and dancing to it."
3,Intended for those with vast amounts of time on their hands,"This was well done but quite long as it was originally a mini-series of sorts for television. It was fascinating but at the same time, not quite engaging enough for something so long."
2,Puff piece,"While this film might be moderately interesting to those who don't know much about '70's American cinema, it's a dud to anyone who has seen most of the landmark films of that decade. Coppola,Scorsese, etc. are revered in this Docu, and you have to wonder if the interviewers intentionally skipped over some of the problems of a directors having too much freedom. Only Scorsese gives some mention of 'New York, New York' being a dud, while there's no mention of half the insanity that went on during Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now', although it's been well documented in the film ""Hearts of Darkness"".If you want to watch something better, buy ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"". If you want something that involves just as much selective memory, but a heck of a lot more fun to watch, get ""The Kid Stays in the Picture""."
3,Where Are The Missing Scenes?,"I've just finished watching 'Mickey',and found it interesting, but lacking something. I thought to myself as I watched it that there isn't much to this movie. Watching the end credits one sees a list of songs in the movie. The only song I heard was 'Take Me Out To The Ballgame'. Where are all the missing songs? Was the movie edited that heavily before being released, or was this DVD version a truncated version of the original film? 'Mickey' on this DVD seems like a Reader's Digest version of what the film's intent was meant to be."
2,I just couldn't get into this movie,It is rated family but I though otherwise. The main character is running from the law. He has talked his son into playing illegally. He doesn't come clean until he absolutely HAS to.
1,don't waste the money,"It was just awful. We got about halfway through the movie and my older boys left to go finish homework. The acting was bad, the storyline was so bad, and it just wasn't a good film. It could have been a good family film, but it completely missed the mark.I did give it 1 star, because I like Harry Connick Jr."
1,"Don't Get Sucked in by the the idea that this is a ""Family Story by John Grisham""","This is a bad movie. Even my kids (who are big time little leaguers) hated it. The basic premise of the movie is: its okay to cheat the IRS; change your identity and that of your 13 year old son to avoid going to jail; lie about your kid's age so that he can play another year of little league (with an 80 mph fast ball no less); embarrass your City and sponsor, your teammates and their parents, and Little League, Inc.-- as long as you can throw 80 mph and beat those lieing over-agers from Cuba to 'win' the Little League World Series. Oh, and when you do get out of jail for lieing and cheating and breaking all sorts of laws, all is foregoven, and by golly its time to get back to baseball! There is no redeeming social or moral value to this movie. Avoid it. I would much rather have my kids watch Bull Durham (with a little bit of fast forwarding) than this supposed 'family baseball movie'."
4,"Movie -- ""Mickey"" on CD",Great baseball story and a good lesson in life... Disappointed that the CD didn't have in extra material like interview with actors or director or background of the story.
2,"Cheesy,Clumsy,Corny","Cheesy, clumsy, corny. The only actor who moved me was the coach of the Moose. The main character seemed wooden. The Cubans may have come from a leftist country but, in this movie, they come from left field. Other subplots and characters seemed half-baked. Finally, the movie couldn't seem to decide if it was a family movie or an apologia for cheating.The brightest spot was the inside look it gave us of Little League Baseball, but that wasn't enough for it to reach base safely."
5,polly pocket mat,Excellent product & service. Grandkids love this mat. Got this for Christmas have to get one to keep here now
4,Only Human,"I just received a copy of this disc and was impressed. I heard about Dina on another website and luckily got a copy of this disc used. I'd never heard any music by her before so I was pleasantly surprised with the high quality of the music! Her voice is beautiful and the musical arrangements on each track is impressive. If I had to compare her to another singer, I'd say that she most reminds me of Taylor Dane - another strong bluesy & soulful vocalist.The disc features great ballads mixed with a few really good dance tracks which makes for a balanced highly enjoyable cd to listen to & I'd highly recommend it if you're curious about Dina's music.The standout tracks to me are: I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU, GIVE ME THE RIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, RUN TO YOU, ONLY HUMAN, WORLD COME BETWEEN US & MIND, BODY & SOUL"

1,What a joke,"I have two dogs who think that they need to poop on my window well covers. I bought this product to try to discourage them from relieving themselves there. Not only did it not work, it seems to have been the dog version of a neon welcome sign signaling them that it is okay to come by.After applying the spray as directed I left the area for a few minutes and then looked out the window to see if the dogs were curious. To my surprise and disgust there was poop on my window well covers and my dogs both were licking the treated area as though they were at the ice cream parlor on free sample day.I would not recommend this product to anyone, congratulations to those who this stuff worked for, I myself think it is crap and a total waste of money."
5,Sorry to disagree - love this stuff,"I have two rabbits who have the run of the back yard - with a brick fence. Well apparently word got out and all the neighborhood cats decided our yard was a great new hobby. I've seen possums back there too, and a little hawk tried to get Felix. Well I bought this stuff, sprayed the top of the brick fence and the surrounding trees. I also sprinkled the granules in a couple places. Now we have had total peace for over two months - I just respray (generously) when it rains, which is not a whole lot here in Southern CA. The rabbits are kings of the yard again (which is not easy when you're that far down on the food chain)."
1,Does not work,"I used mot of the bottle on my small front lawn.It did no good at all.No rain that night still the next day my neighbors small dog wandered all over my lawn and yes left that nasty stuff some of you may likeas fertilizer.Do not waste your money on this , I already got a refund at Lowesfor my purchase."
1,Totally ineffective!,My dog went straight to the treated site and did her business with enthusiasm.Multiple applications provided the same results.
3,Liquid Cridder-Ridder,Does not repell rack-rats very long but seems to work on rabbits. If there is a food source such as newer car wiring (soy-based insulation) pack-rats will still find it and have a feast within a week.
1,Should be re-named Human-Ridder,"The only thing that this product is good at irritating is the humans using it. During outdoor application I got a whiff of the stuff and had to leave the area ASAP. However this junk just does not work on the animals it was advertised against. I used it on a garden bed that stray cats were using as their personal restroom. Cats were deterred for about a day, then they resumed their daily business. Used it on groundhog entrances to my backyard and along my fenceline. The damn furball came and went without any problems. This product is a complete waste of money. Would give it no-stars if I could"
1,Doesn't work on squirrels,"Bought a bottle to spray on some plants that were being eaten by squirrels. Even though it never rained, I sprayed them almost every day. Unfortunately, the squirrels came back any time I wasn't around to chase them away. No matter how heavy I put it on there they still ate the leaves. For clarity, I live in Austin, TX and the these are called rock squirrels. They look like a normal tree squirrel but have black heads and the 1st third of their body. I doubt their genetic make up is much different from tree squirrels."
1,Does not work at all,"Hoped this would keep the squirrels away from my flowers, but they sat right on top of it and weren't bothered at all. In fact, we ended up with even more squirrels the next day, it was almost like they were attracted to it. Waste of money...."
1,waste of money,"We had high hopes for this product and when we sprayed it on it was so noxious to us that we thought that it would be effective. However, within seconds ( it was not even dry yet ) the squirrels were back and it had absolutely no effect on them. We stood and watched as 3 squirrels descended up on the bird feeder and began eating, soon even more squirrels arrived and stood on the top of the feeder what was still glistening with the product. We sprayed the surrounding area as well as the feeder itself until wet and dripping and it had absolutely no effect on both the adult and baby squirrels......don't waste your time."
2,I'm not convinced the chipmunks are gone,"I drenched the base of our decorative brickwork, using a whole bottle in a week. That was a month ago. The old chipmunk holes are still poked-in but I think I saw a new one yesterday."
5,CEO reviews,"As a CEO of a financial services company, I receive many books to review that are primarily focused on strategy or vision. While both of those are important to the healthy growth of a company, I tend to see the same philosophies described in different words. This book is different. It reveals the principles of leading in a refreshingly simple manner. The focus of the book is achieving results through leadership and it offers powerful insights to all levels of management. Our executives and management team intend to recommend it to all those in a leadership role and to those who desire to lead in the future"
2,Ford Mustang License Plate Frame,"The frame looked great when I got it, but within 5 days of having it on my car, the black lettering in MUSTANG started falling out. By the end of the first week it said MU____G. Not quite the look I was going for. I ended up buying high gloss paint used on miniature car models to fill in the letters. It looks alright, but not made very well."
2,Mustang Letters,The Mustang Letters are falling off. The plate itself is rather sturdy but the lettering isnt very well made. Plus the caps that came with didnt fit the plate.
1,Disappearing Letters,"Letters fell off like everyone else said. Ended up with ""_U____G"". Removed it and threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money."
5,Book Review,The Face of War carries some of the highlights of Ms Gellhorn's long and illustrious career. The stories are excellent and I recommend it highly.
5,Trevor Hall is Amazing,"If you have not heard this album yet you need to! Trevor Hall is a young talent that is going to blow everyone away. He mixes Folk, reggae, and rock to make soulful moving music. Either in the studio or live this kid will become a new favorite of yours. The Live EP is also pretty amazing as well. Get this Record NOW!!"
5,Amazing,Combine the passion and intensity of Dave Matthews' vocals and the upbeat sound of John Mayer and you have this amazing new talent Trevor Hall. Simply amazing.
1,TRV230 The worst camcorder and a ripped off,"Terribly grainy even in well lighted room. This produc shows how SONY sells products by it's name and not quality. Image quality shot from camera is unacceptable and LCD display is equally horrible. The absolute worst camcorder anyone can buy. Remember, buy product only on it's merrit and not brand. SONY lost my loyalty forever."
2,I agree! Do not Buy this camera,I have found exactly the same problem - grainy and unnatural colors for indoor shots. In fact I compared the video quality with my 6 year old Sharp camcorder and found the older camera had clearer images than Sony DCR-TRV230 in almost EVERY case.
4,"Wish it was ""flatter"" black","I wanted to match a flat ""camouflage"" black I pained on my nerf blaster. just some touch up work. This isn't really glossy black, but not as flat as I would have liked.It was easy to ""paint"" with and got in all the places I needed it very easily."
3,"KING CREOLE, MOVIE GOOD, DVD BAD",BOUGHT AS GIFT FOR NIECE. MOVIE WAS DARK AND HARD TO SEE IN THE BEGINNING. IT HAD ISSUES THROUGH OUT.
3,music is life,"I'm 60+ and brought this for my male-friend who loved the music on the CD because he had seen the movie in his youth.I had never seen the movie up until now, but I think of all the Elvis movies made, the DVD had the best music of all the films Elvis made. Up until his mention my favorite was G. I. Blues.Musically I'd stick with Elvis's 68 Comeback DVD: the black leather program shown on TV way back when.The only one that sticks in my memory that I don't have is ""Jailhouse Rock,"" in black & white, I beleive."
4,ELVIS COULD ACT WHEN GIVEN A CHANCE...,"It's a pity Elvis didn't force the Colonel to help him get more roles that had some acting - he might have been known for that, other than the cheesy do-overs of the 1960s.Elvis' good performance, plus performances by Dean Jagger, Walter Matthau, Vic Morrow, and Carolyn Jones make this worth having for any Elvis fan. Who knows what might have happened to the King of Rock n' Roll and his career, had he stepped up and demanded more real acting roles in his movies?JOHN C. CAREYCAPTAINU.S. ARMY"
5,Great Price for Classic Elvis Movies,"This is a great price and with the no tax and free shipping, it is wonderful to be able to get this many Elvis movies in one set. All of us Elvis Fans have seen these movies many times, but we never tire of them. They are great for the whole family without the PG, R or X ratings of today."
5,long awaited purchase,"This was definitely worth the wait. I had been trying to find this DVD for over a year and was so happy to finally find it on Amazon. It's a great movie. I read it was one of the few movies Elvis did, that he was actually proud of. With that information, I had to purchase it and see for myself. Now, King Creole and Jailhouse Rock are my favorite Elvis movies."
4,King Creole,"Elvis Presley's last movie before he was drafted into the Army. It is his best and has the best soundtrack. Songs like Dixieland Rock and Crawfish, the duet with the black girl, capture his essence. Liliane Montevecchi is showgirl Forty Nina, decked out in bananas. King Creole is set in New Orleans' French Quarter (Vieux Carre). The King Creole is the club where Elvis performs."
3,Doesn't froth as well as the Aerolatte,"The plastic frothing head does not work as well as the Aerolatte coiled metal froth head. Other than that it is a well built, attractive product. For my money, I prefer the Aerolatte."
2,could have been better,I was expecting a super duper frother after reading the reviews----However I find it disappointing. My last one I bought in Europe had double the speed so the it was really thick and frothy immediately. I find the on button extremely awkward to use as it sits on top of the frother.I am used to a side buttonwhich gives more hand held control and freedom to froth. I wouldn't buy it again.
5,Love it BUT....,"I love this little gadget. I'm a paleo eater so I use this fella to foam warmed coconut cream to blend with coffee for a faux latte. It's a great tool. However, I bought it at a small, specialty grocery store and paid only ten dollars for it. Keep looking before you throw down the twenty they're asking for here."
3,Battery Operated Frother,"I purchased this frother with the idea that it would work for me in my Handcrafted soapmaking kitchen. I tried using it to blend my soap colors into glycerin and it seems the glycerin is too thick to properly blend. I don't recommend it for soapmakers, but should be fine as a milk frother."
5,Fun frothing,"Great product. Light, easy to handle, does a great job frothing my milk for coffee. Would recommend this to anyone who loves a special cup of morning coffee."
1,stuff was dry on arrival in mail,"The stuff must work since mine was mostly dry in the tube and a real bugger to try to get out so if you get a tube that is fresh and then are able to apply it to what ever then it should work for you.Don't know about customer service, have not had time to follow up to use them."
4,Cute little notebook...,"I got this for my teenaged niece, and she really liked it...but she is a hardcore Blythe fan. I didn't particularly think it was worth the price (you can find nicer journals for this amount) but it is nicely made and she certainly seemed pleased with it."
5,Cute little journal,I love the cute little Kenner on the cover. I think the colors are fun and retro just like Blythe.
5,"Excellent instruction, great DVD","For anyone looking to learn the basics of tai chi form and movement, Tricia Yu's DVD is perfect ... her instruction is clear and beautifully demonstrated in the DVD. You get both a front and back view of all movements, which really assists in learning the form! This particular form (Fundamentals) is also great. It focuses on the basic movement patterns of tai chi and really helps beginners (and experienced tai chi practitioners) learn proper alignment and refine their form."
4,Tai Chi Fundamentals with Tricia Yu,"Tai Chi Fundamentals with Tricia Yu seems a perfect dvd for me, at the age of 86. After only 2 sessions, my sense of balance is improved. Picking a correct lesson out of the menu is a bit challenging, but I am learning to master it!"
3,Basic Tai-chi Movements,"This is a good entry level DVD for a few basic Tai-chi movemnts, but not an actual complete Tai-chi form.I did find it useful for working with a group of mild mentally and physically challenged individuals. That is not to suggest that this would be the only people who would benifit form it.It also introduces many of the core concepts of Tai-chi in a very basic and easily understandable way. Some of the demonstrations could use a bit more narration to reinforce the correct focus and performance of the movements. Espically when the actual fundamentals form itself is demonstrated."
5,Beginner's Joy,"As a newcomer to Tai Chi I found this video extremely helpful. Ticia Yu illustrates the movements both facing you, which some criticize but is important for being able to view the hand movements accurately, as well as with her back to you. It is simple to review with the guided practice section at the end even if one has only a small portion of time. The format of the DVD is sensible and easy to follow. My only criticism is that Ms. Yu is extremely flexible and one must not attempt to imitate her rather too large foot movements as a beginner. I would highly recommend this video."
1,I received a zerxed copy!,"the book i ordered with a photo showing is an old original book, but i received a zerxed copy,that is what i can not accepted.it is for the first time that kind of event has happened to me from my experience purchasing books on amazon.com."
4,good cd,not great but good what makes it good is ann nesby if you never heard this women sing you have miss truly one of the best r and b and gospel singers ever just listen to a place in my heart track 10 breathtakeing singer
1,NOT BALL Tips,"Ordered this item because I needed some ball-tipped metric hex keys. The picture of the item (with the squared off tips) is what I received, not the description. For less than four bucks I'm not out much, but still, someone dropped the ball when they labeled these ""FULLER 130-7610 9-Piece Metric Long Arm Ball Tip Hex Key Set (blue)""."
5,exactly what I wanted,Bali Women's Stretch Cotton Light Control Brief #8037Just what I was looking for. Comfortable every day wear. No binding or riding up.D. Richardson
5,"TIP: Buy this book, if you don't like it you can put it back","Two parts crazy fun and one part workplace playground, this book has kept my imagination and my mind on the same blinding path through more than one day's work week. Honest. My favorite page is 74. Your's will be different."
5,Loving the Dunlay!,"This shoe is so cute and sooo comfortable. I was able to adjust the sling to customize the fit, and the leather is very pliable, not digging into my foot anywhere. I have wide feet, so digging is a regular part of my life when it comes to sandals or anything with a heel, even if I order wide. Naturalizer is great. If you get the right size, their shoes are comfortable AND pretty."
4,Historic Document,".... ...""Thirakwa""'s playing on this recording is, inmany places, beautiful to me; however, it was recorded when he wasquite old, and he sounds somewhat awkward, even weak in some parts. Istill recommend this cd to those who are interested in tabla, but thesound quality is poor, and the playing, though very fine, is not thegreatest ever recorded. ...."
3,an alternative opinion,"Some parts reveal awkwardness on the player's part, and the timbre of many of his strokes is not even. This man was not in his prime at the time of the making of this recording, if he was ever great as a technician (he has some famous compositions to his credit). He also had an annoying (to me) habit of playing very powerfully in slow parts, and skimming over rolls. While this may have been something which he would have done with any amount of technical ability, I think that it is likely that this habit stemmed from the coupling of his desire to play forcefully with his inability to combine speed with power. One more feature of the playing on this album which I find annoying is the uneven rhythm. I think that, rather than being what is usually thought of as bad time keeping, this unevenness is the result of emphases. Thirakwa is, to me, somewhat like a pianist who, in the name of ""expression"", never keeps a beat."
1,Sonnet Technologies TSATA PIC Card Review,I have a mac and the card intermitently cuts out and losses the drive I have connected to it. It spouts some crazy lettered error message to the system and that's it. You have to restart to get the drive back up. Very scary. Not sure how to fix this problem.
3,Not the best Cary Grant movie,"Okay, so it won an oscar... in the 30s. I didn't really care for it. Grant has much more interesting fare both black and white and color."
2,Didn't work well for me.,"I bought this tripod to use with a spotting scope for long range shooting.With the scope set to 55x magnification, the slightest wind would cause enough movement to make scoring difficult or impossible at long range (300yds).I'm sure this tripod would be suitable for camera use without a high zoom, which is probablu wgat I'll use it for, but I would not recommend it for a spotter for anything over 200 yds."
1,CHEAP JUNK!,"This happens to be my second review of any Amazon product. The item is a cheaply built piece of junk, unable to hold a spotting scope level. Primarily injection molded plastic. Only tightened it to remedy the angle and it broke. This will not hold 4 pounds or maybe even less. Now to find something better. I'm unable to comprehend how it got numerous 5 star ratings. $24.00 hit to the wallet. This was purchased at Amazon."
5,Awsome tripod !!,"I got this for a gift and almost kept it for myself. LOL Seriously...this is a great tripod for the money! It is as stable as it could be, very compact, and I like the handle for positioning it. Only thing I don't like is that you cannot tilt it, but that is such a seldom used feature that I don't care. I like how the head can rise up a few inches. It will be used to take photos of die-cast cars for a collection."
5,Sturdy enough for big cameras,"Length:: 1:25 MinsI could have used this tripod when shooting my first video review. If there ever is a second video review I am sure I will. This is a winner! Sturdy, reliable and reasonably priced."
2,Won't stay tightened,"I loved this tripod when I first got it. But after just a short period, I can't get it to hold my camera in place; it falls over. I have tightened it as much as I can, to no avail.Am I the only one who has had this problem?"
3,A Bit Short,"I purchased this tripod to use with a Celestron 80 spotting scope for range shooting. Although the unit appears to be well built, it does struggle with the weight/size of the scope. It also appears to be a bit short, even at the tallest setting. With a straight scope, you will need to duck down to see through it. I probably won't use this at the range, and will instead use it for my digital camera or camcorder."
5,lovely!,"great little tripod, feels really strong giving support to my camera and it's sometimes heavy lenses. easy to use, to carry, to install. nice little addition to my photo kit."
5,Under-rated,"If you don't give this product a 5 star rating, you have under-rated it. It is everything it claims to be, and priced right to boot."
4,Nice Tripod For the Money,"I purchased this tripod in February because setting my camera on a stack of books to take macro shots wasn't working out so well. I needed a tripod that was easy to use (I am a novice, in the extreme), portable, easy to store and sturdy and reliable. This tripod does all of those things admirably. I love that I can set my camera at a wide variety of angles and heights and all of the changes are pretty easy and fast. My only small gripe is the wide stance of the legs. I have a small dresser top where I do my macro photography and this tripod takes up a lot of room and sometimes it can be a little difficult to maneuver around. I like this tripod and would recommend it to anyone who needs a sturdy, easy to use, basic tripod."
4,Great for wheelchair use,I was looking for something that I could adapt for use by my husband on his power wheelchair. This was the perfect height and had the flexibility for him to use it one handed. He has a wheelchair tray and I simply placed a piece of dysum down so that it wouldn't move. It worked so well for him that I told some university students working with the disabled about this very inexpensive way to adapt a camera!
4,They're Ok...,"These little speakers are ok. They can get loud for a small room, but at the pool, I pretty much have to put my ear on the speaker to hear it. It does sound better than a set of laptop speakers, and it does have a lot more bass than the run-of-the-mill laptop speakers."
2,Very large size for travel and mediocre sound,"I have several pairs of portable speakers for my laptop but forgot to bring them on a recent trip and bought these based on the glowing reviews posted here. However, when I received the speakers I found that they are much larger in size and much lower in both quality of build and quality of sound than for example the Creative speakers. They have a huge and unstable footprint when opened (about 9 inches long and one inch deep) and are not particularly compact when folded either. The sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast, then begin to buzz. I do not recommend these speakers."
4,Terrific travel speakers for iPod et al,"These speakers perform remarkably well for their size and price. Brookstone makes a large, flat speaker which is slimmer than this product, but is mono. These speakers put out meaningfully stereo sound, the hinged speakers allowing for surprisingly sensitive adjustments. I recommend this product and rate it 4.5 stars."
4,PANASONIC FOLDING TRAVEL SPEAKERS,"this product is a good buy for the price, but you have to put batteries into it and if you forget to turn the speakers off after using, the batteries run down pretty fast. There may be an optional ac adapter that you can purchase, but at extra cost. These speakers aren't very small for travel speakers, and don't detach from the middle part, they just fold in, but not all the way to make it more compact."
4,Well pleased,"I liked the fact that it is small but has good sound. I wish it had come with an AC adapter but I was lucky that I had one at home. It also runs on batteries, but I'm sure they would go quickly."
2,Too much static,"Based on reviews posted on Amazon, I purchased these speakers. Was very disappointed in the sound quality. A great deal of static / white noise."
4,perfect,"Though I havent used these speakers, I've sent them to my mom, she is really happy with them, They are not only small and convinient but also offer an excellent quality of sound and if the batteries are new, they have a great sound output. The only thing I dont know is how long the batteries lost. But you could use an adapter to save on batteries.Ripper"
4,Great speakers,These are awesome for the price and size. An extra bonus is the fact that they still can passively transmit sound when the batteries are dead.My only pet peeve is that these don't come with an AC adapter (yet they do have the outlet for it).
4,Great for the price,"I love these speakers. Like several people have mentioned, I wish they would have come with an a/c adapter, even if it cost a little more. I have purchased several other speaker options at twice the price and these are better than any of the others I have tried. I would definately recommend these speakers and a good set of rechargable batteries. I am looking to buy an a/c adapter but am uncertain as to what I should get."
4,Good travel speakers,"I was looking for a decent set of travel speakers to use with my MP3 player. We've had the Panasonic speakers for over three months and they've been great. We've taken them camping so my 2 year old can listen to some soothing bedtime music. I've set them in the bottom of the stroller basket when my husband and I take our son and dog out for walks. We've even used them in hotel rooms to dance around and burn off some energy after traveling in a car all day. The construction is durable and they fold to the size of a paperback. The battery life is excellent - we've only changed batteries once so far. The sound is acceptable. They're travel speakers; you can't expect them to sound as good as your home stereo system. I've found that turning up the bass boost on my MP3 player helped. Overall, good deal for the price."
1,No good,"We purchased these speakers for our son who is overseas. Within two weeks he said they were already buggy, and could only be used in certain positions. By the time he had had them a month he was already looking to replace them. The speakers were just sitting on a desk; no extreme use."
3,Okay but Wanted More,My Compaq has built in speakers so I wanted something that was louder than those and soemthing portable enough that I could travel with it. These are NOT what I needed. These are good if you do not already have speakers.
3,Better than nothing,"My stereo was stolen from my car and given it's age investing in a new CD player was silly. I ordered these to go with my sony cd walkman. They are ok but can't handle ANY bass without dramatically distorting the sound, and this problem has gotten worse since I bought them 3 weeks ago. They're better than nothing."
2,Not very informative,"I believe that the text itself is not really informative. The basic concepts can be understood from the outline of the six principles. The text does not do much of a job in elaborating the principles, or demonstrating how they have been or should be applied in the real world. I also don't believe that the principles are really new to the business community. It rather emphasizes principles that the business community is now attempting to abandon, to achieve a more cooperative way of doing business in the future. (see ""Co-opetition"")"
1,Disappointing,"You know, not every track is bad--what was bad were the few songs by artists complaining about downloaded music and their songs and talent not being all that good to begin with. Quit your bitchn' is what I say. Get some skill before you whine about not getting your money, because you earn what you deserve. Also, that being said, this compilation album is something I did PAY for and the complaining was such a turn off. I should have tried to just download the tracks I liked instead of being honest about it. It isn't just the complaint songs, its the fact that they weren't very good that tainted this entire cd for me. Such a shame, and such a waste of money. My money. Blah."
4,to small,The only problem is that some parts are bit challenging to read because of the size of the words. Dr.suess is still the best.
1,not a childrens book,"if you want a book on his thought process, great book- if your looking for a book to read your child ( mines 3 yr old ) you should pass on this. My husband and i were both pretty surprised when we got it and it wasnt a childrens book"
1,No!,Hopelessly misconceived and awkwardly performed. See my review of the Messe de Tournai performed by Marcel Peres and Ensemble Organum.
2,What she doesn't know?,As a fan of Beverly Barton....the plot sounded good when reading thepurchased review ....but this falls flat.....not as good as some of her other writings.....the spoiled rich girl/woman line is just too common andannoying.......if one wants to read about self-center spoiled women..we can catch the tabloids on Paris Hilton....
1,Beverly Bartoin Books,"I have read many of the books by Beverly Barton and enjoy her writing. But unfortunately, I have been purchasing paperbooks because they are lighter to hold while reading. However, I will not be purchasing any more paperbacks by Ms Barton because the of the last 5 books I purchased, 4 of them fell apart while I was reading them. This is the fault of the publishing house. They evidently are cutting the glue to hold these books together and also to cement the book into the cover. I guess this must be thier way of cutting costs, but they have lost a customer."
4,bella,"I enjoyed reading this as I have all of Beverly Barton's books, I found it hard to put down and it keeps the reader interested from start to finish,I have read many of her books and have not read one I did not enjoy."
3,it was ok,I liked this book a lot and thought ms.Barton did a good job withn the chemistry with Max and Jolie.I thik she spen t to much time with all of the diffrent side stories I found myself skipping a lot of the parts that didnt have anything to do with the mystery or the romance between Max and Jolie.There was a lot of back story that palyed in to this and I found it a little distracting that she put in a lot of stuff that didn't need to be in there.I ususally have no idea who the evil villian in theese stories are but I had a preety good idea halkway through the book and I was right.I think this book would have been better as a lifetime movie than as a book.I am sorry I boght the book and wished IO had gotten it from the library instead.
3,Good Read,"While I liked this story, I couldn't give the book any more than 3 stars because I found the character Jolie so unlikable that it was hard to care much about or, or figure out why on earth Max was so hot for this woman.Great author though -- definitely worth checking out her other works."
3,Not bad!,"This book was not an ""I couldn't put it down"" type of mystery, but it was good. I liked the main character, Jolie, but I wasn't too crazy about Max. This was my 1st book by this author and probably will not be the last."
2,What She Doesn't Know could fill a book and unfortunately did!,"What should be a twisted suspense filled novel turns out to be a scattered melodramatic southern soap filled with characters I could care less about and in general annoy the heck out of me. The action scenes are just barely OK . The love scenes although explicit are so weirdly dispassionate and disconnected that they just about scream ""Cheesy Porn Flick""! What I Do Know is I want suspense that has a solid plot, twists you can't see around, characters that don't make me want to hunt them down and kick just about everyone of them and a few hot and appropriately placed love scenes for spice. This book has none of the above and frankly I want my money back."
2,Lost Potentials,"This is a compact little book with nice black and white illustrations appropriate to the saints, martyrs, or heroes depicted in the synopses above. The information in this book, which represents a great deal of research by the author, is presented in a manner that is interesting to read. That INFORMATION, however, is ESSENTIALLY INACCESSIBLE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT INDEXED. Only the illustrations are, but not in a way that would give the reader a clue as to the page on which the story about a particular saint, martyr, or hero can be found. Nor is there a clue in the titles that top the pages. In the next printing could someone please add an index? If not that, how about printing the name of each saint, martyr, or hero on the page where his/her story first appears in bold?"
2,Disappointing,"The impression I got from this book is mainly that Rawlins himself is an unpleasant fellow, in a whiny sort of way. Good Lord, why complain so much about having rhubarb for dessert? His unpleasantness wouldn't matter so much if the book wasn't, in a sense, a diary, the kind of book where the reader is thrust into the company of the writer from beginning to end.There are also lots of lyrical descriptions of snow, rocks, ice, mountains, etc.; other people may go for that sort of stuff, but I found it self-indulgent and pointless. Give me Edward Abbey over this fellow."
5,Excellent Sci-Fi Flick,"This is a well-made indy film that has a pretty interesting premise that's supposedly based on a real story.It's about how our government used to use young boys to track down aliens and then agents would go in and kill them.The main plot is about 2 of these boys who are now grown men and are pretty screwed up from a life of constant hunting.Some good action & fight scenes.After I watched the film, I did some researching on the web and found a lot of documentation that supports the theory!"
1,So bad it isn't even funny,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. At least the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is funny. Acting is bad, the script is horrendously awful. Even better, the pace will kill you."
4,The westerner,"I have never read a ""western"" novel before, but found that I really enjoyed this one. It was an easy book to pick up and read, it flowed well. Rusty kept the action going. His vivid descriptions of the landscape evoked a nostalgic feeling of the ""old west""."
4,The Westerner,Fast paced and exciting. Good western story and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I could not put it down. THe incidents and the hero are what we would expect from history of the west and from authors like Zane Grey. Rusty' book is a good one and I look forward to the sequel.
5,Beginner or expert!!,"This camcorder is great for any level and a bargain for the features and quality you get. The camcorder is very compact and very manageable under any conditions. A teacher told me once the picture quality of these hi8 camcorders is broadcast quality and he wasn't kidding!! The zero-lux feature enables a picture in total darkness. Great!! The zoom feature is nice and crisp, the digital zoom realm gets a little questionable for my taste. The menu provides lots of options and effects to play with. My family has a blast with this and I truely believe that Sony makes the best for the dollar in this camcorder catagory!! You won't be disappointed with this one!"
4,"Contrasting Stories, Great Value",Home Alone:A young boy copes with the loss of his family in a late 1900's Chicago suburb.Cheaper by the Dozen:A middle aged man struggles with an overwhelming gaggle of children when his wife inexplicably leaves town to pursue selfish ventures.
3,DISAPOINTED,"I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I FOUND A DVD WITH THE WORST EDITING EVER. FOR INSTANCE, YOU ARE SITTING ON THE BALL AND OUT OF THE BLUE YOU FIND YOURSELF LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH NO PREVIOUS INDICATIONS FROM THE PERFORMER, I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING WELL DONE AS WITH THE REST OF THE DVD'S I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON.COM."
2,"This Book about Cities is an Interesting, but One Way Street","To a city dweller since their early teens, City Life proved to be interesting reading for me. With respect to content, Witold's work is brimming with detail. Despite making his home in a land full of impressive cities with teaming skylines, Witold nonetheless gives European cities the credit they deserve. No sentence seems to be spared as trivia, analogies, historical fact and fiction pour out of the pages like traffic down a busy street. But this is a one way street, since what City Life has in the way of content, it lacks in direction. Witold does not really lead us anywhere in City Life. Each chapter expertly discusses concepts and components of an urban existence, but there does not seem to be a larger argument. Every book should encourage the reader to draw their own conclusions. The problem is, Witold's is not as strong as it could be."
5,Great companion for a US road trip,"While driving up the Ohio River valley to Cincinatti, my husband and I read this book aloud to each other. City Life provides a framework for thinking about city development and the history of American expansion. It confirmed our intuitions plus provided new food for thought. If you're the type who enjoys meandering through a city wondering about the hows and whys of the city's rhythm, layout and buildings, this book is for you."
4,What Went Wrong?,"This book attempts to answer the question-an important one to my thinking-""Why don't our cities look like the great ones: Paris, Rome?"" Rybczynski, a student of architecture and city planning discusses the history of American blunders from the highway to the skyscraper, from the ""City Beautiful"" movement, to the negro rush toward city centers in the late 60's. It seems that everything that could've gone wrong, essentially has. Still, the author sees hope in the forms of a few master-planned towns (east coast), and of the modern suburban mall, which he sees as a place for people to gather and do commerce, while feeling safer than they would in urban areas due to the malls' governing rules and aesthetic uniformities which have been abolished in the name of individual freedoms elsewhere, to our peril."
3,Interesting but undeveloped ideas,"Author touched upon interesting ideas on why American cities are different than those of the European/Asian cities, but more often than not it reads like a histroy book of urban development, rather than the in depth analysis that one would assume from the title/description. Many key points are revealed, but all need further development before one can be convinced of their validity"
4,A very good album,This album is very good. It has an amazing song Birth Machine 2000 and the rest are very good. It is in the same formula as the Carnival Bizarre . Domm metal but not boring and slow as their first album. Well their best album till this one is Th Carnival Bizarre. A must for all Cathedral fans.
2,Disappointed in crate,"This is for pets right. Perhaps puppies, Don't puppies chew - a lot. Sadly, the puppy chewed the plastic zipper and now the crate is useless. I wonder why this is not made with a sturdier, steel zipper? Though it worked beautifully for 6 weeks, it does not now. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great carrier!,"I bought this carrier for my 12 lb cat, and it is huge. That's a good thing though, he is able to stand and lay down comfortably, and the plush bottom is easy to remove and clean. At first I was concerned that the mesh wouldn't hold up if he clawed it, but it appears to be very durable, and he didn't do any damage when he scratched. I like all the little storage spots attached, I can easily fit his water/food bowls, and food. He likes the open airy design because he can see around him and that keeps him calm.The only reason I didn't give five stars is the fact that there is only a shoulder strap for carrying it around. It's a big and slightly bulky, so it would have been nice if there had been two straps to carry it in one hand."
1,It scares me that this book could be published,"The author is clearly trying to help beginners design better code, but I find it frightening that people are reading this book and putting his ideas into practice.James Cooper does not understand the essence of the patterns that he is trying to explain. He gets the patterns wrong from the start and then spends pages working his way out of the traps that he has set for himself.Please do not buy this book, unless you are looking for somehting to amaze your friends with. I seriously thought that this book was a hoax at first, and a pretty sick one at that."
1,Singleton pattern is laughable,"After reading his Singleton pattern and implementation, I can't help but think that the author doesn't grasp the fundamentals of Java at all.Throwing a SingletonException from getInstance() when someone already has a reference to the singleton goes against the key advantage of the pattern. Another gem is the author's suggestion that there should be a central repository for singleton instances.Was this chapter even reviewed? I can only assume that the whole book is of this low quality so for your own sanity and the betterment of mankind do not buy this book."
2,A disappointing attempt at a worthy goal,"Like other reviewers here, I had hoped that this book would offer a more approachable look at the GoF design patterns. Instead I found it to be confusing in places, wildly inaccurate in others (Cooper mistakenly identifies the WindowAdapter class as an example of the Adapter pattern, for example), and filled with bad examples and poorly written code. I ended up putting this book aside and investing the extra time in rereading GoF and I would strongly recommend that others do the same."
2,The author doesn't understand the patterns he's explaining,"I liked the writing style of this book. It is much clearer and understandable than any other pattern book out there, but it has one major flaw... the author doesn't understand patterns either! Here's one example... Template. Easy! Take an algorithm, put it in an ancestor class and extend it, then implement the steps of the algorithm. I just explained it. However, Cooper misses the most important part: the algorithm!! Instead, the section labelled ""Template"" is in fact not about the Template pattern, but a decent explanation about how to use abstract classes. I looked in my copy of GoF and re-read the Template pattern section. It's only about 10 pages long and is explained fully on the first page. This may be the worst example from the book, and other templates he explains pretty well. For someone new to patterns however, it's very misleading if every third pattern isn't correct."
1,Unnecessary.,This book basically unreadable without the Gang of Four book. And if you already have the Gang of Four book there's no reason to buy this book.
2,i dont think this book worth my time to read,"well, i have Pattern in Java at home, and this book at my working place, compare 2 books, i like previous one much better. Always, the pattern is not fully described, and you have to go through details in code to get what is the pattern realy about. Even worse, i dont know how is source code on CD get compiled, i have tested it with JDK1.1.8, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, some method like, stack.top(), stack.nextTop(), i cannt find it anywhere. Some part of the book like the deep copy logic, i think it is wrong.well, anyway, i didnt pay this book from my own pocket."
2,Quite Disappointing,"Just like another reader I found this book quite disapponing. While reading this book there was never a AHA| moment, that author has explained this concept well. My yardstick for measuring any Author's writing is Ivor Horton (writer of Java and C++ books).In case you still have access to Web Tutorials for this book, then that is good enough. Buying the book is not very good invetsment."
1,read Design Patterns Explained instead,"This book misses the point of patterns. It explains patterns as if they are solutions to recurring problems. Gee, I thought that's what they are? Well, they are - to some extent. They are more about a way to think. The problem with patterns as design solutions is that they don't help you until it is too late. Design Patterns Explained talks about why patterns are good solutions. You can then use this information on any project."
2,Shakily 2 stars,"I can barely give this book 2 stars. There is a ludicrous amount of typos. I can't believe Addison-Wesley allowed this out of their press. The typos aren't simply misspellings, but rather references to methods that don't exist, incorrect references to return values, etc. The code snippets will pull variables and custom classes out of thin air without any introduction. The only saving grace (and the thing which has kept me from burning it) is that it is a _decent_ refresher on design patterns if you already know them. However, you'd be better off rereading the canonical ""Design Patterns"" book. Maybe this should be one star..."
1,Kind of disappointing...,"When I viewed this book's description and contents on this site, it seemed like a promising companion to the original Design Patterns text by Gamma, et. al. Unfortunately, IT REALLY MISSED:- The chapters are short, choppy, and focused on minor code details rather than the big ideas.- There are no complete programs in the text itself. Nearly all of each chapter is spent discussing code fragments that are inscrutable without a copy of the corresponding program from the disc.-I don't think this book was edited...The Preface promises a tutorial on the JFC in ""Appendix A"" - this DOESN'T EXIST! Most of the chapters contain annoying typographical and logical errors. The chapters are so short...why couldn't someone read through them before putting forth a book with a nearly fifty dollar price tag!My overall advice: keep waiting for a book that truly meets the challenge of presenting design patterns from a Java perspective... this ain't it!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the worst book I have read on java design patterns. The writting, like the author's column on java-pro magazine and his book on java, is unclear, at times even somewhat goofey. Most examples are strange and irrelevant to IT professionals. Over all, it reads as if the author is talking to himself while sleep walking. Programs provided on the CD are also pieces of pointless show offs and overkills, This book is hastly put together. It is clearly not written for anyone who wants to learn the subject"
3,Supplementary for GoF book for Java Developer,"It serves as a good supplementary to the GoF Pattern book for Java developer.The sample in the GoF is C++ and some examples may not be familiar to Java developer (e.g. compiler example in the Visitor pattern).For Java developer, I suggest to read the GoF pattern book to get the concept of each pattern and come back to see the java example here."
3,"Good idea, sloppy execution","The idea is great - provide an explanation of design patterns using visual java components as examples. The author's explanations were usually clear. But there are so many typos that I quickly lost confidence in the code samples and the book itself. It also looks like the coverage Swing was an after-thought. The last few chapters are a superficial tutorial on Swing that provide very little insight into Swing or design patterns.Looks to me like the author did his job, but the publisher (editors, proofreaders, etc.) let him down."
4,Clear and concise with concrete examples,"First let's deal with the typos. There are many of them and some are serious. Looks like there was a rush to market here. Hopefully these will be corrected in the next printing. If it weren't for all the typos, I would have given this book 5 stars.Now to the book itself. I love the organization: all the GoF patterns, each with a clear and concise description. Plus each pattern is accompanied by at least one working example. Each example has a Swing interface so you can run and modify the code to get a better acquaintance with the pattern. Each example is accompanied by a UML diagram which shows how the objects in the pattern relate to each other. The UML diagrams do not show the Swing interface. This is good, it puts the focus on the pattern itself, not on the GUI wrapper.After reading this book, I feel that I have a very good basic understanding of the GoF patterns -- well worth the price of the book."
3,extremely irritated,"i think this book was written with good intentions, to function as a tutorial or a help-guide to the densely written ""Design Patterns"" , or to provide java examples in a more readable way. so far, i like the way book is organized and the way he explains the concepts that i couldn't understand just by reading the original book. however, the examples are from hell!! why in the world would the author think that the general readers would be familiar with 'seeding', and 'heating' in swimming competition? and different types of gardens? i understand you are a swimmer and a home-owner but that's not a proper reason to make readers confused."
4,Ray of Hope,"This book showed me a ray of hope when I was bogged with GoF patterns book.But there is a bit disappointment in the way author explains Factory Method pattern,I couldn't get what he was trying to tell ,the swimmers example was way too complex for the scenario.But the rest of the book is flawless he covers all the patterns successfully.But I always have a question How many more books do I have to buy ?"
1,Zero stars really,"The author should not even be trying to write about Java, let alone about applying patterns using Java. Abysmal book - I read it in the local library and thought, wow a Java patterns bookk based on Gof. More like Goof. Stay away, stay far far away."
1,This was a joke!,I was not able to compile anything from the textbook! The code on the CD did not match the code in the book and furthermore were even different examples.
1,Tell us facts,"The author's opinions seemed to taint the ideas in this book. He's obviously a very strong proponent of good object-oriented design, but with almost thoughtless blind faith."
1,Not a good one on design patterns,"I agree with one of the reviewer that book examples doesn't match with IT field. The book might have some value for interviews(lot of interviewers ask about patterns during job interview) but at times is very confusing. The author goes back and forth on explaining things. Since book doesn't contain whole code examples on paper(they should be on CD), it is hard to follow author's thoughts(if he is trying to convey some!). I guess publisher has tried to take advantage of design pattern buzz word."
1,"Poor samples,boring text",I did not like this book.The examples are so unnecessaryly long and boring that you are missing the main concept.I strongly recommend Head first design patterns for every java developer.Don't waste your money on this.
1,Distracting Typos,"I'm compelled to add a 'me too' to the complaints about type-setting. This book's errors are such a distracting mess that it is a disappointment. If you are a Java developer desperate for a Java-centric treatment of patterns, and you are thinking this book is a slam-dunk for your library because it fills that niche -- think again and proceed cautiously -- or simply spend the money considering this a place where you'll get a few tid-bits that will help you on your path."
3,Buy the other one.,"This book is just the Java implementation of the patterns described in Design Patterns. If you've already read Design Patterns, this book has very little to offer. If you haven't read it, you probably should."
1,Truly Awful,"This book is a complete waste of spacetime. The author clearly has no real comprehension of any of the patterns he purports to describe. His examples are bug-ridden, have hideous style, and often totally contradict the text. Simply comparing his class diagrams with those in the GoF book indicates that his code has almost no correlation with the actual patterns. Couple that with a frighful lack of basic Java knowledge and you have something that will only serve to damage young designers. As a concrete example: the Prototype pattern means, to Cooper, that your class has a clone method. That's it. And he can't even write *that* properly, and instead gives a thoroughly incorrect exposition of how Java cloning works.Stay far, far away. Please."
1,Can't Hear the Deadboys,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this cd. The sound is so muffled it's annoying and almost incomprehensible. Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this cd. The sound is like all those bad videos from CBGB.I'll try again with a different CD like ""Young Loud and Snotty"" and maybe that will have a better sound. Much of Stiv and the Deadboy's vids on youtube are really poorly recorded and this cd sounds much like that. You can do better!"
2,Mired in the mud for 200 pages,"The author agreed to traverse Africa with a man she didn't know very well. Turned out they had differnt priorities - he was intomaking the best time, and she was more interested in seeing the people and land. The result is that, for about 180 pages out of 268 we get to read her complaining about the man. I understand that sometimes you get into a situation that is so bad that you lose all perspective, but I would hope that the author had reflected a little more before writing the book. She identifiesmale/female power struggles as the problem, but does little to figure out, even in retrospect, how it happened and how she could avoid this trap in the future. I know that she had to interact with people to buy food, for instance, but she focuses so stongly on the relationship that she rarely writes about people. The last 60 pages or so are interesting."
4,"Come on people, without Keoki this CD wouldn't be here!","Allright, allright. I'm sick of people who constantly kick Keoki arround, give the poor guy a chance! Anyway onto the CD... This cd is pretty rad. Theres some phunky remixes on this album by ak1200, Crystal Method (which is very mediocre compaired to their full lenth release ), Dj Dan ( Da Man!), and more. I love Dj Dan's work on ""crash"", hes an awesome breakbeat artist! and wow! Dara actualy does a remix that I enjoyed. If your looking for a good party cd, put down that ""MTV's party to go"" and pick this up!"
1,Don't order from Amazon,"This is for a G01W006 which is the updated version that includes RAID 1. If you're looking for RAID 1, don't order this from Amazon/CompUSA!!! They will ship you the G01Y006 (with a ""Y"") which does not have the RAID 1 capability, only RAID 0. What a pain!!!!"
1,Very poor reliability,"I have the 1 terrabyte (Two 500gb drive) version of this external drive configured as raid 1 for ""secure"" back up my files. After about 4 months, I suddenly get the blinking white button and the device is not recognize by my computer (nor any other computer. Maxtor is no help whatsoever. I strongly suggest avoiding these products."
1,600GB of pure problems...,"I have this product and it sucks. Now all it does is flash its white light at me. I have tried everything, reinstalling the software, powering off the drive itself to try and reset it and pressing that one touch button on the outside of the drive. Oh I'm about as geeky as they come. I spent my Friday night performing the above tasks and I have come to the conclusion that the drive is dead after a call to Maxtor tech support. Hopefully it is still under warranty, I bought it this August.I bought this thing because it was an editor's choice on CNET. Sometimes I wonder if they get kickbacks to put products in a positive light. 600GB of pure problems... Hopefully Maxtor's customer service is responsive. The tech I spoke with tonight said that this unit has had a lot of problems.Take my word for what it is worth; don't believe everything CNET says."
1,AVOID IT !!!,"OK... so I shelled out almost $290 for this thing. Now it's pretty much a paperweight. I've had it for about three weeks now. It worked for about five days (total). The problem is software (I think). I've reinstalled the driver four times by now. The hard drive works for a day or two, then it stops. Just sorta sits there and blinks it's supid synch button at you. Then you have to delete the ""Maxtor one touch"" programs and drivers from your computer. Then you have to re-install them, because Windows XP does not recognize it via its ""plug and play"" feature. If you run either ""device manager"" or ""install hardaware"" applications, you will get a ""cannot run the device [code 10]"" error message. IF you try to contact Maxtor, you will be told that it is a problem with YOUR computer and NOT THEIR DRIVE (!!)So... If I may suggest, do find something else to do with your money...."
1,The book is an shame and defamation to all western science,"Letting English major editors dictate what physics books get publishedand their content is a modern disaster.We have ,now, two types of books :1) worthless dumbed down2) technical unreadableand thanks to publishing this trashnothing in between that might aid education?The book is an shame and defamation to all western science :a book about supersymmetry that doesn't mention group theory or Lie Algebra.I makes someone who knows better very angry that publishers can be this irresponsible.The book is:1) a waste of the writer's time2) a waste of good printers ink3) a waste of the buyers time and moneyJohn Gribbin's ""The Seach for Superstrings, Symmetry and the Theory of Everything"" is better: still too dumbed down to be of much good totally."
3,Some good subject matter,"I, like some other reviewers, was a bit disappointed with the depth of some of the discussion, and the complete lack of mathematics. Kane's writing style is tiring in some parts, and the first 3 chapters took as much time to get through as the rest of the book. However, I did appreciate the discussion on the Higgs field. The author presented that in a manner that made it's importance clear."
5,"Outstanding, ""student-friendly"" contribution to physics.","Supersymmetry covers the quest to uncover a grand unified theory of how the universe works - something Einstein failed to achieve. There have been numerous books on the subject but this is the first to describe what research is involved in creating and testing the theory. Different perspectives, arguments and challenges in developing a supersymmetry theory are contrasted."
2,"Mistakes, Mistakes, Mistakes","The book is littered with mistakes. Just Kane's way of writing itself is poor and difficult to follow. He pretends to explain things yet he really does not. One example of many is that he says that ""outside an atom there is a residual electromagnetic force that binds atoms to molecules."" This is blatantly incorrect. Molecules are held together by sharing electrons that are w/in the atom. The electrons can then become delocalized and stray from their normal orbit (based on electronegativity) however his statement implies a world made up of ions... the world is not made of NaCl. This is just one example of many mistakes the author makes. I am finding it difficult to even get through this book. In addition to the mistakes the author does a horrible job of explaining himself while he dumbs it down at many parts he does so too much while at the same time he introduces concepts with out introducing them. Don't waste the time."
2,Superymmetry at the wrong level,"In his review of Gordon Kane's book Supersymetry, R.J. Fokkink bad raps Witten. The book doesn't claim to be co-authored by Witten and states only that the Forward was written by Witten--which he did.The correct level for a book on a complicated subject such as supersymmetry is, of course, the author's first challenge and I believe that Kane shot too low. The ""layman"" will probably find the whole subject pretty dull and the ""informed layman"" familiar with the basics of the standard model won't find much that he or she didn't already know. I wish Kane and the physicists at Fermilab luck in finding a super particle in the next few years, but will be on the lookout for a more informative book on supersymmetry."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book. Supersymmetry is such a fascinating subject, it is even more fascinating if nature turns out to be indeed supersymmetric. However this book, is written in such a style that it assumes that the readers IQ is below 50. The author throughout the book tells the reader that some of the details are too complicated for the reader to comprehend. He avoids using any equations, or in that case any significant mathematical examples that are above the level of a 5th grader. However he does explain the Higgs Boson pretty well. I was disappointed that the book is not more technical, I don't mean at the undergraduate senior level, but something that you would get a great read with basic calculus skill level."
5,A must for all African nature lovers.,"I loved this program. It featured the nature living in and around the Acacia forests of Tanzania. This was nature from a new perspective. A species of Chameleon is shown along with their babies. I loved the footage of the baby chameleons catching baby spiderlings out of their web as they hatch. They were very cute. It also showed hyenas, lions, giraffes, elephants, wildebeests, leopards, cobras, and other animals. I loved it and so will you."
4,A Deformed Outcast Has A Chance At Normalcy,"While spending her entire life on Indigo (a planet in the Earth Conclave) as a repulsive outcast because of her deformed appearance, Magdala Cled is startled, yet intrigued, when a rich, attractive scientist named Claudio Loro approaches her with the promise to transform her into someone beautiful by relocating her consciousness into a new body. Magdala agrees, but at the same time, she can't help but wonder what exactly his intentions are.Although I love Tanith Lee's writing, ""Electric Forest"" isn't my favorite book by her. Granted, it is short (approximately 150 pages), but the technical jargon in the pre-screening and post-screening chapters baffled me. These two beginning and ending sections weren't really necessary to the story, in my opinion, and only seemed to muddle the plot. Still, I would recommend this book to sci fi fans, for a quick read."
4,Bah Not-humbug!,"I get the real print of Charles Dicken's novel. The Great Illustrated Classics version has everything in the book detailed easily, and the pictures help out with the story very much. If you want to understand the story of ""A Christmas Carol"", this book will help readers greatly."
2,NOT usable in my tub...,"In order to use this product effectively, you need a tub that has a specific type of faucet and water pressure. If your tub has a faucet with a narrow stream that does not get wider the further away the water falls from the faucet [think about twice the size of the standard kitchen faucet], the product may work for you. You will also need medium water pressure [that's enough to make your kitchen sink do fine but makes it difficut to get shampoo and conditioner out of your hair if you're short]. If you don't meet this criteria, find another solution. [I just fill the tub with my showerhead that has a great filter!]I actually hated this product but rated it 'didn't like' as I think it may have some limited usefullness for others."
3,ok for small jobs,"the product is OK for small jobs, as is evident by the size of the tube. that said ,the color is close to my original mortar but i used it on my front steps and when it rains the new stuff really stands out like a sore thumb.likewise as a filler on steps one tube doesn't go very far. i would use this again but only on walls and with backer rod. also as i recall the delivery was quite late."
4,A blast from the past,"Very enjoyable soundtrack!My favorite, of course, was the original version - track #5.Second in line was track #3. It's a rather eclectic mix andwell blended.I listen to it while driving and exercising.The constant, driving beat makes its point throughout the track.It manages to set a very exotic theme, too."
5,"Ni siquiera deberia decirlo, porque LA MANIPULACION","ES LO QUE TRAE MAS CLIENTES A MI BUFETE !Pero por decencia, quiero advertirte que un buen manipulador, lleva al hombre ( y a la mujer ) a los delitos y los errores mas increíbles!MAS VALE QUE TE PREVENGAS A TIEMPO... O QUE TE VAYAS BUSCANDO UN BUEN ABOGADO COMO YO (jeje )"
5,In the tradition of MR James,"My introduction to Jonathan Aycliffe's work began with Naomi's room a couple of years ago, and since then I've been hooked, and have read all of his works. His latest offering doesn't disappoint either...it is a tale of pervasive darkness [an underlying theme in all of his works] and the corruption of souls. Aycliffe's style is reminiscent of MR James, another master of classic horror, and fans of the classic ghost story will not be disappointed in this work."
1,"Its more like ""Devil in a CD pile""","Its this Rootsy, country, folk sound with other instruments in the mix.I'm not buying it........oops I did, I wish I hadn't.I read the reviews and it sounded pretty good but to my dismay it was far from good.Maybe they needed help mixing it in the studio?! the vocals stick out like a sore thumb, maybe thats what they were going for but it doesn't work.Apparently they're good live, I'd pay cover to see them but would not pay anymore on a CD.I do like the ability to use a clarinet, tuba, kazoo and a jug.Yes there's the Broonzy and Charlie Patten covers but they're nothing stellar."
1,The toy that fell apart on Christmas!,"This horse trailor is not durable, it started to fall apart within two hours of opening the package and playing with it. My daughter is nine so she wasn't rough with it. She and I were so disappointed. It was Christmas and she had waited a very long time for this particular toy. Anyway, first a window popped out then another then the back window then the bumper fell off and on and on it went...I felt horrible for her. So, I DO NOT recommend this toy for anyone. It was not worth the money I spent on it."
2,lacks durability,"My boys, ages 3 and 7, were so excited to receive this from Santa. They specifically had this toy on their list this year! Unfortunately 2 of 3 doors broke off within minutes of opening it. Both boys were extremely disappointed as was I because it was not a particularly inexpensive toy. Not at all durable."
2,Not good quality,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this item. The truck mirror broke off just trying to get it out of the package. Then my husband tried to open the side door of the trailer and it broke. The trailer hooks up very snugly into the back of the pickup, and that has already cracked. We have only had this two days!"
1,terrible,broke within 2 minutes of my son opening it. This is the only thing he asked for Christmas and it was a total bust. Not a durable toy AT ALL.
5,Gift For Lil Man (great grandson),His mother said he was so delighted with the gift he immediately started setting up his farm and playing with it hauling in his cows and horses.
4,250 continuing ....,"I found this book had very whimisical and charming quilting patterns. While this is not the first book on this topic I would buy. Because it does not do basic quilting designs, every quilter should have it in their collection to inspired and amuse them."
4,Quilting ideas,I love the bringing interesting backgrounds into my quilts. I want the quilt to be mine from start to finish. This book helps giving a great variety to designs.
3,250 continuous-line quilting Designs,"Somewhat of a disappointment as many of the drawings are not terribly good. They seem to have been created in a hurry. Still, overall this is a useful book. A note to Amazon: selecting only the best of images for the previews is not really kind to your customers. Would I take one of the author's classes? Certainly."
2,Not very satisfied,"Yes, the book does provide you with 250 continuous line designs; however, I couldn't find more than a few that I would even consider using. The patterns are very child-like and may be appropriate if one was quilting for a baby or child. The book is nicely segmented by area (bird, animals etc.) Very few instructions, only the basics. For me, it wasn't worth the price and had I had the chance to see it before purchasing, it would not be in my library. A good choice if you want a way to quilt outlines of animals, plants, and birds."
3,only so-so,"Personally I wasn't very thrilled with this book; I did find a few usable designs when looking for non-traditional ones such as cats and frogs, but many I felt were kind of sloppy; I had to make some modifications."
2,I gave up.,"I wanted to like this novel. Having never read one of Rozan's novels before, I did not know what to expect. What I found was a confusing mess of alternating viewpoints, unlikeable characters, and long-winded flashbacks which did nothing other than add pages to an already lengthy book. I gave up reading 3/4 of the way through--I just found myself getting annoyed with the pace and alternating narratives. Too bad, because the subject should have inspired an amazing story."
4,Average read,"This is an ok book. I LOVE her other books. While this was good, it paled in comparison to her Lydia Chin/Bill Smith mysteries."
5,Gorillaz are hype.,"This is one of the best CDs I've purchased of late. I love Blur, as well as hip hop, so This hits me right where it counts. Albarn's lyrics mixed in with Del the funk funk and mad beats bring this album in tight. Ok, enough of my meanderings, just go buy it. WORD!"
5,gorillaz? or guerillas?,"this CD is the bomb. first i hated monkeys but this changed my mind. i first heard of it from my friend, and i thought he ment guerillas. like the brazillian guerilla.my favorite track is Clint Eastwood. It makes some sense plus the beat is sick. all you hip hoppers out there this is the CD"
4,excellent!,"this cd is great. too bad only six songs are good. but those six are some of the coolest songs out there. #2,5,7,9,10,11. so yeah, if you wanna spend 15 dollars for 6 songs, then go ahead, its worth it. thanks for your time and good evening."
3,Self-indulgent and meandering!,"The previous reviewer asks the question, ""Does Damon Albarn ever sleep?"" Well he seems to be doing a good job of it here. Hype and creative animated visuals aside, the music simply doesn't hold up as a complete listen aside from a few great moments. And, not surprisingly, those brilliant moments happen to be the singles Clint Eastwood and 19-2000, so you're not missing much. ""Songs"" like Latin Simone and M1A1 are somewhat humorous after the first listen, until you realize you've plunked down [item price] for this CD. Albarn has to be one of the most frustrating musicians around today. We all know he's capable of great things, but he seems more content to indulge in pretentious, self-indulgent, jerking off than putting together any sort of consistently brilliant music (Blur's The Great Escape is the closest he's ever come, IMO, and even that pales in comparison to truly great pop artists).Buy the singles and forget the album."
5,THE GREATEST BAND EVER!!!!!!,"Yahoo!! I love Gorillaz so much! they are my favorite band ever! this cd is great and it hasen't left my cd player. their music is so addicting its like being on drugs--only its more safer (i would never take drugs)yes i am a total fangirl and i love all the songs on this cd. Plus I have a crush on the lead singer, 2-D (yay! im one of his fangirls) I would say that this cd is better than their demon days cd, which is also very good (i have both of their cds) Go out and get this cd, trust me you will love it."
2,Not quite up to it,This cd was a disapointment to me. Only song i liked was Clint Eastwood. The singing is ok at some parts but the music mostly[disappoints].
2,Spinal tap without the laughs,"This album is supposed to be some sort of parody, but I never understood it and neither does anyone I know . The sad thing is people i know think is great music when the musicians themselves know its just a experimental form .The only reason this isn't 1 star is because of its originalness at least they tried"
3,Highly Polished,"This being the ""first"" CD from the Gorillaz makes wonder. The Album is pretty good overall - each track is a completely different music style than the previous. There are songs on here that harken memories of Blur Song 2, and some gansta rap, to trance style.To me, it sounds like an artificial band put together by a group of producers - kinda like Kid Rock - all marketing and very little substance. The music is good, and the CD doesn't contain any surprises. Very good for background music. There are some catchy tunes - namely ""Clint Eastwood"" which has recently been picked up by MTV.If you got the cash, it wont damage anything.Note: the CD is embeded with a data section - insert it into a PC and it pops up wanting to load a ""key"" to access the bands website. Very annoying. With the inclusion of the data track, it renders the CD unplayable in my computer - where I listen to most of my CDs. There is no useful or entertaining value to this added ""bonus"""
4,Tomorrow Comes Today,"This album is great. LIke Many others, i got this because of the video Clint Eastwood and 19/2000. However the rest of the songs are different. The guys are cartoon characters and that caught alot of eyes. All of the songs on this CD are orinal and display great DJ skills. The Emcee shines everyonce in awhile. If you expect all of the songs to be like Clint Eastwood then you are wrong, but the playyful beat and melody makes you see the cartoons character doing what they are actually doing in your head. The Emcee doesnt talk about cars, hoes, chains or none of that, this is the type of CD that will put a smile on your face instead of hearing how rich some1 is.Lyrics: B+ProductioN:ADelivery: B+Overall: B+"
4,A Hybrid of Styles Brought Together That Actually Works,"Initially I thought that Gorillaz were trying to be a little to electic covering quite a few musical genres.. But the more I listened, the more I realized that it effectively gels well as a whole album.Just a very mellow mood through most of the record and the different vocals definately give it variety. It was also nice hearing Del on the radio (the hit single Clint Eastwood), never thought I'd see that day! Have to give them mucho respect for having him appear in a few tracks, he is one of the brightest lights in the underground rap scene.Anyway, if you missed this album the first time around, it still sounds fresh and is worth checking out. Enjoy it since it might be awhile till they put out another album seeing as how this is just a side project. Peace.. =)"
4,"A unique, interesting, and enjoyable CD","When I heard the Gorillaz for the first time, it was, of course, their single ""Clint Eastwood"". Judging by the single, I assumed the CD was rap. I am not much of a rap fan, but it was unique enough to warrant a purchase. Imagine my surprise when I found the CD was not rap but, I'm not sure what to call it, so I'll say techno-pop w/rap-style beats. Anyway, on a first listen, I thought it 'bit.' After a few times, however, I realized it was actually a cool CD, with interesing vocal styles, cool beats, and very unique music. While there are a few songs I don't like, all in all it's a pretty good CD. I highly recommend it, mainly because it is unlike anything else I have heard before, but don't expect ""Clint Eastwood"". The rest of the CD is like the single, minus the rapper."
4,a MUST BUY for all Gorillaz fans!,"Gorillaz self titled album i a great CD!I think it is really good because there are so many different genres of music, all mixed together- without resulting in [junk]! It's the best cd i've ever bought!! The only let down to me is 'Man Research (clapper)' and 'Latin Simone', the reason of this, in 'Man Research (clapper) the 2D screeching over-runs the good stuff. 'Latin Simone' is not appealing to me, because it isn't even in english. Without these 2 tracks, i'd give it 5/5. Great piece of work. Can't wait for g-sides!I think it is a must buy for gorillaz fans!(; BUY IT! you'll love it!"
5,Good stuff,"This is a good change to the metal crazy-rock world...Great bass lines, and just strait out good music. I like it beacause of the slow mood to it and all the songs are good (omg). It shouldnt have a Parental advisory, they hardly ever swear. They only swear in clint eastwood twice and once in starshine or something like that. But if your looking for a good slow-pace album, this is for you."
3,"The Singles were great, but...","I bought this after seeing the three animated music videos for 19/2000, Tomorrow Comes Today, and Clint Eastwood. The singles were unbelievably good, and I'd venture to say that there was at least one other great song on the album. Unfortunately, the majority of the songs on the cd did not live up to my expectations. The Gorillaz is really an experimental type of band, and a lot of the music shows it. While I applaud the daring and effort the album took, it really did not stand up as well as the singles did on their own."
2,Where's Del?!?,"When I heard ""Clint Eastwood,"" I was expecting to hear more from Del throughout the album. There are only a few good tracks, like ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" and ""19-2000."" The other tracks are weird as hell."
2,Don't waist your money,I regret of buying this CD. It has about 4 desent songs and all other once are a waist.
2,Over-exaggerated CD,"I cant believe all these people gave this CD a good rating. I bought it thinking that all of the songs were going to be like "" Clint Eastwood"", you know with a little rap, but some singing. Well let me tell you that this was soon to be found out not to be the case. A lot of the songs are weak, and its more sound FX than song, and the singer just wails in a lot of the tracks. The only relatively good song on this album are, ""5/4"", ""Clint Eastwood"", ""Double bass""(Although its all instrumentals, and keeps repeating itself), ""Rock the house"", and ""19-2000"". So if you asked me if you should buy this CD I would say NO."
4,Huh?,"I first heard/saw the Clint Eastwood video on the internet, and after a few weeks, I was just dying to buy the CD. So I brought it home, popped it in, and my god, I've never heard anything like this. The songs are nothing like Clint Eastwood, but they have a lot of very weird attributes. For those who like rock and roll, this CD is not for you. It never gets up that rock and roll ""beat"".Its so weird, this CD almost makes me cry for two reasons: one, the songs are very haunting and atmospheric, very other worldy. Two, the bad part is it always seems to want to evolve to something beyond the Hip-Hop beats I think its restrained to.I don't know what to make of this CD, its so depressing in some parts, then it becomes Hip-Hop, and I wake up from that coma I was in from all of that sleepy, very surreal music. I swear this stuff is more potent than any hallucinating drug. Listening to it has left me speechless. I can't decide whether I like it or not, but I can say one thing:Oh My God"
3,woooww.... this is expensive man!,"well, is worth it? first thing you must think before purchase this double cd.1st, okay, there are bonus tracks, 2 remixes and a couple of b-sides. but, you can find all of these in the other gorillaz material. like in their previous single and their new EP, G-sides.2nd, the videos. there are 3. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, and 19-2000. these videos are GOOD, but it is on VCD format and there is NO guarantee it is playable on a DVD player. well, amazon says it can, but I own it, and it is NOT playable on my DVD and two of my friends DVD player.3rd, the price!it is VERY expensive. go buy G-Sides EP and their single. but, if you are a die hard collector..."
4,Interesting and Inventive,"Gorillaz is the 21 century first concept album. The idea of artist using fictional caracters is something that has been appealing to succesful artist over time. Maybe the best example of this is the Beatles Sgt. Pepper album (which in no way I am comparing to this release by the way). By using this approach artists are able to free themselves from stablished ideas regarding their musical background and it allows more room for experimentation.Gorillaz has done just that and it has produced and interesting and inventive recording that along with the comic strip characters presents a very believable piece of work. This may not be the most important record of the century but one thing for sure is that it brough excitment to a quite lame year in terms of new and interesting concepts in music.What you get is fresh tracks with music that it does not take itself too serious and that mixes elements from hip hop, electronica and rock."
3,"Great concept, poor execution","I kinda dig the idea of an anime hip-hop group and the lineup of folks like Damon Albarn, Kid Koala, Del the Funky Homosapien and Dan the Automator to give them life is certainly intriguing and fraught with promise. However, it seems like the Gorillaz are letting us in on a joke concocted by a bunch of guys hanging around the studio ripping bong hits rather than a fully-realized concept. I say this primarily because this CD's style is all over the map which, in itself, is not a bad thing. But in this case it makes for too many distractions and an incoherent listening experience. So, after a few listens of Gorillaz you're left thinking, ""gimmicky"" rather than ""genius!"" There are a few gems, but Clint Eastwood is about the only tune you can bob your head to. 3 stars for the concept -- it still has promise fellas -- but no stars for execution."
5,Real Music is Back,"This is the real music I have been waiting for about a few years. Nothing like this happens very often. This is a classic album for all people. ALL SONGS ARE GOOD. If there's no song that you don't like in this album, I think there's something wrong with you. Many Blur fans probably have this album already. But for those who haven't, this is the one you cannot miss. It's fresh, it's lively yet, calm and cool with rythms of hiphop. It's the combination of blur's british melody and the colorful sound and pumping rythms of american urban."
4,"Kickin' Album, yo!",Nice mix of techno and hip hop and occasionally rap. Something great to just sit back and listen to.
5,hollllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!11,"yo this album is kick ass though i don't know why they put a parental advisory thing on it they only cuss on two songs and theres nothing nasty on the case or booklet or enhanced bonus they it really only cuts sales cause ""the man"" dosen't think you should listen ((god that line sucks)) the thing is that the album was really good and i really liked ""5/4"" ""re-hash"" ""left handed suzuki method"" who wouldn't like them (even though the band isn't real) they are cool so why not buy the c.d. plus for you kiddies don't get your parents intemidated by the parental sign just blast the c.d. on and all you hear first song only says f*** two times then on the last it only says a** two times as well so don't be afraid ^_^ ^_^"
4,Gorillaz = Talent Behind a mask?,"Who are these cartoon characters and where do they come from. Do they have something to hide? Definately not. All the members of Gorillaz has come from a line of talent. Damon Albarn is from blur, Tina Weymouth originally from the talking heads, the dj kid koala, more vocalist/guitar contribution from Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto, and rap from UK successful Del The Funky Homosapien, not to mention production credits from Dan the Automater. What is produced is a bit less than perfection but definately not a bad side project as well. Here you have a blend of Rock/hiphop/Electronics as well as a bunch of other influences into it. So much talent put into a box could have produced something better but this effort isn't bad at all."
2,"Interesting project, but criminally overrated...","This effort is probably one of the biggest hyped albums of the year, mainly due to the fact that Gorillaz is a very interesting project. I mean, an animated band...it's a brilliant idea. But let's stick to the music, shall we? The album's highlight is without a doubt the smash hit single `Clint Eastwood'. And fellow singles `19-2000' and `Rock The House' are OK too, but the rest of the album is an utter letdown. It seems as if the people behind this project had a rush making this album, because most of the songs are dull, monotonous and definitely not interesting. Don't let the singles fool you. The album really isn't that good at all! Actually, the best thing about Gorillaz is their excellent animated videos. Maybe, if you're a real hip hop fan (or as I call it `Brit Hop') you might dig this debut. It's not my thing, I guess..."
5,The Best Music Cartoons Ever,"I love Gorilaz they ment so much to me with there song ""Clint Eastwood."" I got so into them and nowIjust addicted I drew some pictures of them too.They're great with their mix of Punk,Rock,and Hip-Hop.I dedicated my voice to sound like the music.And after so much practice I finally did it."
3,Review,I liked The CD It's pretty cool. But My CD Has 2 More Tracks 19-2000 (Soulchild Remix)& Clint Eastwood (Ed Case Remix)
2,Nothing like I expected,I bought this cd thinking it would have songs like clint eastwood. I was wrong. There are only two songs that are good on this cd. They are clint eastwood and the clint eastwood remix. The rest of the songs are very slow paced and just weird. I definitely don't recomend this cd.
2,"Excellent animation, less than great music","I think that Gorillaz is more for fans of animation than fans of music. I fell in love with that little line that shows up on Murdoc's butt as he's thrusting himself around on the ""Rock the House"" video, but just listening to the CD was disappointing. Am I the only one who thinks that the music doesn't live up to the visuals?"
2,Open Mind,"The Gorillaz CD ""Gorillaz"" is not my personal favorite. Some people seem to like their disturbing lyrics and odd sound vibe. I will admit, there were a few times when I thought to myself, ""This could be something."" But then again, there were many times when I paused the cd player to say, ""What do people see in them???"" More often than never, I paused the cd player to ponder over this. One of my friends loves Gorillaz, and me, being open minded, decided to see what he sees in them. I cannot. My brother liked them, so he had the cd. To listen to this cd, you need an open mind, and plenty of time to stop the cd player and say, ""What is appealing about them?"" I give this cd 2 stars, and say that I do not understand what IS appealing about the bad lyrics and bad singing. The beats are ok, but I'd rather them be set to another song."
3,One great song - the rest are a waste of time,"This CD reminds me of the first Talking Heads CD. One great song, with the remainder being truly uninspired songs that are almost painful to listen to. ""Clint Eastwood"" is cool and original, with a fantastic Music Video. Buy the single and save some $$."
2,I tried to like it,"I like the song Clint Eastwood, so even after reading so many mixed reviews I ordered the CD. The CD is like a mixture of every style of music that exist. It is bound to have at least one song you will like, however, not many people buy a CD for one song.Personally, I am going to tape that one song I like and sell the CD. I listened to it several times, hoping it would grow on me. I tried, but no interest."
1,Terrible,I am sorry but this album is really really really bad. It is not really that artistic. It is just a bunch of people talking throughout the whole album to a certain beat.The only thing that I can say that is remotely positive is the animations.Besides that I wouldn't recommmend this album at all.
1,Gorillaz should never even be alowed to open their mouths,"I love music, especially rock, but when i heard the Goraillaz I ccouldn't believe that that noise was supposed to be music. If I had to pick one band to never have to listen to again it would be the Gorillaz. The only reason they are getting any stars from me is because I can give them nothing lower."
1,Not worth the buy for one good song,"There is only one song on the CD that is worth listening to.. The rest of the CD, is not worth a thing. The entire CD has 1 good song and is not worth the rest."
3,"Virtual or not, they're still a good band.","Who cares if the band technically doesn't exists. That doesn't mean that this cd isn't still a good one to own. If you've heard Clint Eastwood and enjoyed it, then most of the CD is just as good. Track 6, Man Research (Clapper), is a really good. Another one is Dracula with it's slow, creamy smooth feel and catchy lyrics. And this disc isn't finished in 30 minutes, no sir. It's a full 70 minute CD which is a hootin' deal. Another perk is the enhanced portion of the CD. Once it's inserted into the computer, you're taken to Murdoc's Winnebago which is filled with nifty little features like an exclusive screensaver. Some may say that it's nothing more than another Blur album, but I say if that's how it comes off to you, then fine. If you like Blur, then pick this up, you won't be sorry, and if you are sorry, then I'm sorry."
4,Incredibly Innovative,"If you are looking for a pop CD that will get heavy airtime and rotation on the radio...this isn't it. And that is a shame because this is one of the most innovative albumns I have ever had the pleasure of listenening to. I had been awaiting its release since I first heard bits of the song ""Clint Eastwood"" on MTV2. I just picked it up over my lunch hour and was blown away. So, if you like funky hip-hop, slash, rap, slash rock...do yourself a favor and get this album, and let all your friends have a listen to...the sound is addictive."
4,Del is shining,"All of those who like Blur will love this cd and those of you who like del wil not want to stop playing his song again. Ever since Del, who is rapper Ice Cube's cousin, became affiliated with Causin' Effect Entetainment and Funktafried Scientifix, he has seen a real boost in his career. Dan the Automator, who used to work with Mista Mental, has his beats glistening track after track."
4,Finished Monkey Business,"Like King Kong let loose in New York, Gorillaz lumbers out of the jungle and into the city. This multicultural side project from Blur's Damon Albarn mixes its cartoony graffiti art aesthetics with hip-hop, tough-guy raps, lounge, Jamaican dub and squelchy melodica into a dense and dirty eclectic urban stew. It's all performed with a sense of fun, strangeness and adventure, as on ""Clint Eastwood,"" which comes across like Lovin' Spoonful gettin' busy with Grandmaster Flash. Hey, Gorillaz is seriously B.A.D. - in the Big Audio Dynamite sense, that is."
1,What a great idea!(sarcasm),"Here's a great idea! Since nobody likes stupid techno music, Why don't we have the ""mucicians"" hide behind the scenes and have a bunch of badly drawn cartoon characters play the ""music"". Everybody loves cartoons right? Wrong! You'd be better off buying a real life gorilla to destroy the CD for you. What I just said makes no sense and I am aware of that but you really shouldn't waste your money on this CD."
2,Overhyped!,"I bought this cd amidst all the hype over a tecno/hip-hop group and I must say I wasn't real impressed with this cd. Then again I don't really listen tecno but the hip-hop portion seems out of place. This is a good concept album but unless you really listen to tecno, you may not want to buy this cd. Fans of hip-hop may find it extremely lacking."
2,Not what you might expect,"Just reviewed this CD, as most people I was mesmerized by the animated videos for these dudes. To me it seems that they spent way more time on the marketing for this band, and it shows. I was expecting the tracks to be kinda like Clint Eastwood, but in fact this album is all over the place. Reminds me a lot of Beck, however the production doesnt come close, vocals are very weak, and they leave a lot of free, ambient spots which annoys me. The rap sections were good, if you are into rap. If you are someone who likes to throw in a cd and listen from start to finish, this is for you. Overall I only liked 6 out of the 17 tracks. Track 11 ""19-2000"" is great. For me this CD was not worth the $$$. I realize I am the exception (most people liked it), and no doubt this album/band will take off, simply because of the unique angle they use."
5,THESE GORILLAZ FLING COOL MUSIC INSTEAD OF POO!,"I liked tis album for the exact reason that I hear people criticizing it: it's simple. I don't find myself wondering if the secrets of the universe are hidden somewhere in the lyrics. It's catchy, cool and they got beats! A collaboration of many cool artists (Miho Hatori, Damon Albarn, Del Tha Funky Homosapien and more), this disc is put together much more smoothly than a lot of the ""guest fest"" albums that are popping up everywhere. This album has songs that you won't mind having stuck in your head all day!"
4,It's not that bad... but not for everyone,"This album is definately not for everyone. It's for all the jaded people out there who are sick of the typical pop songs and stuff that are playing on radios nowadays. Since I'm one of them, it's refreshing that Gorillaz are doing something out of the ordinary.If you hate this album, I suggest you stick with N'sync or Britney Spears for bubble gum pop. (or whatever that fancies you)"
4,Gorilla pleaze.,"Ten years old and still sounds great. Some albums and collaborations fail because they try to do too much, be too much. That's why Gorillaz succeeds. It's everything into the blender but comes out smooth, not chunky. A bit of hip-hop, a touch of dance, and a little...Blur.""Clint Eastwood"" was the hit here, but I think I've always liked ""Rock The House"" even more. The vocal delivery, and the hook of those retro horns. Just great. ""19-2000"" is also a catchy track, and another single I think. The rest is all good fun.This is pennies used anymore. There's no reason not to give it a listen."
4,Gorilla Warfare,"Gorillaz' first album 'selftitled' is a blend of pop rock and rap which isn't necessarily a first but they are still original.Most of the songs are really good (why only clint eastwood and 19-2000). Good Lyrics good sound good everything but could be a little better.NOTE: The intro to M1A1 (Hello, Is Anyone There?) Is actually the intro to the underrated George Romero Classic 'Day Of The Dead'."
2,Hmm......,"This is most definitely an acquired taste. I have to admit, very unique-unlike any music I've ever heard before. But....it's a taste I didn't acquire. Some will love it, and it will leave an extraordinarily foul aftertaste to others. Their music is dreary, dull, and almost discretely angry at its core; unique, still, but has a depressing, goth-like feel. Also, it is very, (...)weird."
2,"Once again: ""don't believe the hype""","Gorillaz must be the latest proof that just about anything can sell nowadays: they are kinda cute cartoon characters, make silly childish songs and pretend to be changing experimental pop music. Good Ol' Fella Damon Albarn has done better efforts before - and I do consider myself a non-Blur fan -, so did Dan 'The Automator' (can you believe the same man produced and helped creating the Lovage project?), so that's worth the 2 stars they're getting.Listening to the whole CD's just got me annoyed and thinking where Blur's frontman had his mind when decided to put this up: probably trying to irritate his pal Liam. By this time, our public enemy Gallagher #2 was doing some real rock music and punching photographers. How can somebody not go for that? Way to go, man!So, unless you're a 3-year-old boy looking for some dumb music, buy yourself something else, like Smashing Pumpkins' ""Rotten Apples"" or Oasis' ""Hindu Times single""."
4,Straight In,"This album is one that i have been able to get straight into from the start. Gorillaz contains the top 5 UK hit single Clint Eastwood and other gems like 19-2000 (their current single in the UK), Tommorow Comes Today, Slow Country and Double Bass. If you want something that is fresh, new and exciting then this album is the one for you as it contains loads of class A tracks that will more than please people."
3,Fun and funky blend of styles,"I was impressed with the fusion of styles on this record. The collaboration of artists works well and keeps you interested throughout. It would be a mistake to only hear ""Clint Eastwood"" and assume the whole album is in the same vein. Damon Albarn and Co. pull each song in a different dirrection and provide a substantial and exploratory album that kept my foot tapping."
3,"Eh, not quite what I hoped for.","Definately not a bad CD, but just wasnt quite what I was hoping for. The only songs worth listening to are the singles, which can be listened to for free (minus about 30 seconds to a minute of the song) on their website (...). Wish I had bought a different album."
1,"Numbing, Droning Anti-Music","I had high hopes for this CD, and the first track started off lively and rich, but very quickly descended into the numbing, droning anti-music that constitutes the rest of this CD. Its disappointing to see such structureless, shallow din from Albarn, who is capable of turning out incredibly rich music otherwise. Thankfully none of these tunes were released on a Blur album and I hope their music never takes such a mindless, worthless detour."
1,save your money,save your money it's not worth it the only song worth listening too is CLINT EASTWOOD so just get the single
1,awful,"I bought this CD thinking that I was going to get a hybrid of Del the funky homosapien and Blur. Unfortunatly what I got was 1 decent song with Del, 1 average song with Del, and the rest a bunch of experimental garbage. with te exception of song 5, this cd has no merit. It is just a bunch filler and electronic sounds with absolutely no coevsiveness throughout the entire album. one only has to listen to track 12 (the lyrics which are entirely in spanish) to realize how truly terrible this album is. If get this album excepting songs similar to Clint Eastwood you will be sorely dissapointed to find experinmetnal Kid-A-esque noise with no musical talent anywhere within the album."
2,OK but.... EFORTLESS,"the beats were so damn good but the vocals suck and the songs never end! there one hit off the cd (clint eastwood) was the worst rap ever! i don't even like rap and i can tell that!the best songs were 5/4, 19-2000 & starshine!don't buy it! it's only wort 2 dollars"
1,"boring, boring, and boring.","wow this was the worst ... that i have ever spent in my life. don't waste your time and money for this piece of 100 percent .... i bought it because i liked the song clint eastwood, but all the other songs sound nothing like it and are sooo boring. it's good for a 2 year old when it's nap time but if you want good music its anything but. main point... don't buy this!"
3,"first book doesn't represent the others, slow start","As the others have stated, the first issue of Preacher was lacking and i probably would not have continued reading them, except that i ordered three issues, hearing that the first might give me a bad impression. I have read the first three, and i have to agree with the poor reviews that the first book was given, but for the entire series i think i will continue reading and probably end up loving it. I just wish the first book wasn't so slow, it will turn a lot of people off. Go ahead and read the first three if you can, I'm sure you will read a fourth. If you juts can't get past the first book, then you'll probably miss out on a great adventure. Punisher Max might be a better choice for you if you gotta have that non-stop action."
3,I didn't like it,"I heard fantastic things about Preacher so I decided to pick it up and to be honest its not that good. Garth Ennis basically seems to write the same dark humor on every page, and even when it starts out witty it quickly gets old. Preacher has a decent storyline even though the book starts off pretty slow and just seems to go downhill from their. The reason why I dislike Preacher though is because I felt like Garth Ennis was just trying to be gross or shocking just for the sake of it, and the fact that Garth Ennis tried way too hard to be controversial on his views of religion. By the third issue I basically thought, ""Good god theirs more of this?"" I felt like I had already read enough."
5,"WOW, YOU MUST READ THIS!!!!!","This is a great story with great characters. The villans are incredible, and so are the heros. If you pass this up you're losing out on a story so great you can't imagine it. i left this at home when i came to college, and it's so good i have to go home to get it because i need to read it again."
5,Just plain evil (but in a good way),"Picture the late great Bill Hicks, Quentin Tarantino and Loki the Trickster staying up late one night drinking a lot of Turkish coffee. Say they decided to write something; something with action, suspense, religious overtones, and mind-paralyzing acts of violence. Suppose they decided to make it shockingly offensive and gut-bustingly funny at the same time. Preacher: Gone To Texas is that book."
4,Wonderful,Dark humor. Not the best or favorite of comic books for me but it deffiently has its niche. An enjoyable read. i have volumes 1-9. nuff said
4,so much promise,"I like this book a lot, but it's part of a larger arc and that larger arc really starts to sag a few books later. What we find here isn't too uncommon in serialized stories like comics or television shows that actually have a long narrative planned in advance, and that's that the stage setting proves to be much more fun than the resolution. I can't say when it gets really bad but it does and it seems to do so over a long period of time. Or possibly Ennis' whole schtick and his characters, never quite as fresh as those of Gaiman to whom he owes a large and obvious debt, get tiring after awhile. You probably won't go wrong with this one, but I wouldn't suggest buying all the books at once."
2,Over hyped?,Was looking for a graphic novel to pick up and this kept coming up as something I would be interested in. Finally purchased it and read it. After roughly 20 pages I almost stopped reading it but thought something might finally happen that would be interesting. There were a few blips here and there but mostly flatlined for me. All of the shock and awe in the book seemed very shoe-horned. It didnt flow and bits that were interesting to me were never really followed up on. I was very disappointed.
3,It bores rather than shocks,"I've already read separate issues of the Preacher series, but I just scored a pile of the graphic novels for cheap at a library sale and I'm going to read the whole thing in order. Currently, my opinion is that they're good but not great; I enjoy the plot twists and the story is fairly original. I enjoy Ennis' warped sense of humor, but his penchant for nutball violence from the mentally bent can get old after a time. I've got nothing against using random acts of senseless violence as plot drivers; at times I applaud creative use. But it sometimes seems that Ennis has some sort of contest with himself to come up with greater atrocities and more freakish deviant behavior. It reminds me of overhearing adolescents using bad language in public-- they think they're shocking people with their rebellious behavior, when really it's all noise and no substance. It bores rather than shocks. Ennis is a good storyteller. He just loses me when he gets too caught up in the crazy."
3,"Not bad, but...","...it never lived up to its initial promise. Profanity for profanity's sake is OK, but a little more substance would have kept my attention past the first 20 issues of this series."
3,Neil Gaiman he ain't!,"This book kept showing up as a recommendation whenever I bought a Neil Gaiman book, but I was a bit disappointed when I finally broke down and ordered it, and saw what it's really like. Where Gaiman uses brilliant dialog and historical/literary references, Ennis just blasts you in the face with continual violence and freakish, mean-spirited gross-outs. There's some nasty, heavy stuff in here that starts to become more sickening than shocking after a while, and if it weren't for the occasional clever joke and the excellent graphics, I would've thrown this book in the trash.So: if you're looking for a twisted thrill-ride of a reading experience, I recommend ""Preacher: Gone to Texas"" without hesitation. But if you want true graphic-novel genius, you should search elsewhere -- Gaiman's entire oeuvre, for instance."
4,The beginning of something great,"Collecting the first 7 issues of Preacher, probably the greatest comicstory ever next to Neil Gaimans Sandman, this one is a must-read for every self-respecting comic-reader who isn't stuck on superhero comics alone. What happens when a person gets possessed by a creature that came to birth from the forbidden lobe between a demon from Hell and an angel from Heaven. Follow Jesse as he goes on his way to confront a God who abandoned heaven with his responsibilities. This series is SF, western, action, humor, oneliners and bizarre storylines all in one put together by the great writer that is Garth Ennis (Punisher, Hitman, Hellblazer). This trade is a very welcome intro to the world of Preacher and has you meet the mainplayers Tullip, Cassidy and Jesse Custer"
3,Experience proves usefull in this sophomore effort.,"In respect to their previous CD, this CD comes off much more musically talented. The lead singer learns that loud isn't always best and he maximizes his vocal range from screams to harmonies. The drummer, while keeping with his rythmical changings, blends more accutely with the guitar and bass, all combining for a powerful punch of hardcore music. Worth checking out."
1,keepin it real,"For those of you who have heard V.O.D'S old recordings,IMPRINT will never compare.The band has changed so much for the worse,that they get booed at shows.V.O.D has sold out.They dont have the old LIHC sound and energy anymore.What was hardcore at its best is now 2nd rate heavy metal."
3,Clone Rock,"For what it's worth this band is worth listening to. They're not terrible. Real agressive and abusive sound was a bit ahead of it's time. However I have to give this 3 stars because it's a blunt rip off of Pantera's ""The Great Southern Trenskill"" CD that came out prior to this in 1996. They have Phil Anselmo doing guest vocals one one track to start and topped it off with a song called ""Twelve Steps To Nothing"" in the wake of Pantera's ""Thirteen Steps To Nowhere"". ...no, really it's true. Credit is due for first CD to make it big from ripping off at the time under rated Pantera."
4,12 Steps to Hardcore Metal,"The second full length album by these hardcore maniacs... And surprisingly it is even heavier then their self-titled debut.IMPRINT is one vicious, raw, album, more metal on this and more insanity... The album begins with ""What you Are"" and doesn't begin to let up until after track #5 ""Imprint"" (Also has some Phil Anselmo on ""By the River"") #6 is ""Colorblind"" is the highlight of this album... Amazing Lyrics - so much emotion - And it ends with Jada Bloom an epic Metal Romance. Again Tim Williams is truly a poet.IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
4,I for one think it's better than the first CD,"This is a good, original heavy CD. Yes it IS more metal than the first CD, but I thought the first CD wasn't that good. This album has alot of bone crushing tunes, and is a good solid pick if you like hardcore and metal in almost equal doses."
4,This is a follow-up that doesen't disappoint!,"This a follow-up album that doesen't leave you thinking that the first album was just a fluke. This is a very hard hitting, in your face album! If you are growing weary of all of the so called commercial sound such as Korn and Limp Bizkit then this is the band for you. If you are a fan hardcore or heavy metal this is a must have to your collection. I gave this album four stars, I didn't give it five because I found track 11 to be rather disappointing. Although the collaboration of VOD and Phil Anselmno of Pantera is worth the cover price alone. If you liked there self titled debut you must purchase there latest release Imprint."
4,Abrasive!!,"Vision of Disorders Imprint is Awesome.One of the most Brutal releases i've heard.Raging guitars Blasting tribal drums wicked distorted bass lines and Tim Williams vocals,fuzzed out screams and powerful melodies.Lyrics are intense and angry.A ride in the most furous hardcore metal i've heard.Yet i have to admit that at times when listening to this release the intesity levels can really wear me down.Yet the whole point of this release is to create the effect of a bulldozer crunching your body into pulp."
5,"Harder than there debut album, but retaining the safe feel","I first heard Vision of Disorder in Study Hall and I was completly blown away. With the dual guitars going full blast along with the best drummer I've ever heard this makes a great Metal album. This isn't Hardcore, this is Metal. Even though this is still Vision of Disorder. Tim Williams vocals are brutal. I wish he did sing a bit more as in their debut album but the lyrical styaling is still there, Thought provoking. From the opening rebellious lines of What you Are to the fading organ at the end of Jada Bloom you will be hooked. Significant tracks are What you are, 12 steps to nothing, Colorblind, and Clone. Thank god there still is hard music and not this rap metal crap on the radio. This is real music not Limp Bizkit or Korn."
2,makes me feel guiltyI,"I have read about half of this book and so far I am having a lot of trouble with it. First of all, the book deals almost exclusively with overeating. I suffer from anorexia, so the book hasn't spoken to my issue too much so far. Also, the author really reiterates over and over again how sinful overeating is (and giving food too much of a prominent place in your life to include restricting your intake). So far, I have found no helpful advice, for change - just more and more criticism of the way I've been living my life. I know that God should be the center of my life. I am striving to get food back into it's proper place. This book has done nothing but make me feel worse about myself. I am hoping that sometime in the second half of the book the author will provide some concrete help to me."
1,very disappointing,"I was really disappointed with this book. had thought the title would mean it would give more practical advice.sadly it was a book that offered little other than confrontation re sinful thoughts and behaviours. while i am a Christian, i felt people with eating disorders need more compassion than just being smacked around the head with verses and dogma. very let down by this book, as it made me feel WORSE not better...maybe for someone who is nearly recovered, but think it would be very unhelpful for anyone struggling with eating disorders"
1,"Lots of Christian dogma, little authoritative guidance","Like her fellow misguided evangelical Larry Crabbe, this woman quickly puts the label of ""sin"" on problems that are more complex. Being told that they are sinners who need to repent is the last thing that people who are struggling with eating disorders need to hear. I think it is this belief about themselves that drives many of them to eating disorders in the first place. The book just pushes evangelical Christian dogma without seeking a proper understanding of the issues it discusses."
1,Love To Eat Hate To Eat,"I was hoping for a book to help me with my food issues from a Christian perspective. This book is mostly just a long sermon, so it was not quite what I was looking for. It's not a very challenging read and it's a little boring at that."
3,Just ok.,This book was so small and hard to read. I would have love a larger copy. I enjoyed what i did read and would say give it a try with a larger print.
4,"Easy read, good advice",This is a down-to-earth read and ways to apply to make your health and life healthier and more alive.
1,Sad way to end an era,This trade paperback features the last Hulk stories Peter David wrote and you could tell that by then he had run out of ideas to do wih the Hulk so he wrote a story where something really devestating happens with the Green Guy.It was something that most readers did not like and many haven't read the comic ever since. It was a sad ways for david to end what was mostly a suucessful run on that comic. Today the Marvel novels that feature the Hulk are the only source of good story material left that they can still better Hulk stories.
2,Just wasn't the fun she had hoped!,"This toy was disappointing for my daughter. It just wasn't what she had hoped for. It was somewhat difficult to use and I often heard her constantly repeating answers trying to get the the right response. I try to be positive, but I can't recommend this item to others."
5,Chill Groove,"I heard this on Satellite Radio, and immediately came to get the whole CD. I was not disappointed; this is excellent ambient groove, reminiscent of Portishead but a little jazzier and funkier, and without vocals."
4,Witty and wise play about thwarted passion,"Tom Stoppard's the Invention of Love is a rich, complex and sometimes difficult play chronicling the life of poet and translator A.E. Houseman and contrasting his career with his contemporary Oscar Wilde. The play is a non-linear reflection on Houseman's life after he has died and is being escorted to eternity by Charon the Ferryman. I should have written my review right after I finished it because I have forgotten much of the substance. But it was very eloquent and amusing and gave me a greater appreciation for the art of translation of classical literature and the struggles of outsiders such as homosexuals in modern times."
4,good product,"they do the job, not too heavy , just the right weight. It was purchased for an older person. so as long as she is happy with them, they are fine."
2,Hausmann Wrist/Ankle Weight Sold Individually - Brown - 10 lbs,It does not fit snugly to the area applied because the divisions are equally shaped therefore it slips when you raise the leg. It appears to be too bulky.
5,Excellent product and service,"The weights were exactly as I expected. They were received in perfect condition. The customer service follow up was stellar, definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for a seamless experience."
1,HAUSMAN ANKLE WEIGHT,"I SEEM TO HAVE RECEIVED A GENERIC, NOT HAUSMANN. IT HAS NO NAME BRAND ON IT, AND IT ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE MY OTHER HAUSMANN WEIGHTS. I WAS CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED. THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE, DON'T FIT CORRECTLY."
3,Made in Taiwan,"I spent $80 on these thinking they were manufactured in the USA. Had troubles with my shipment so meanwhile I had to purchase a $15 pair from Wal-Mart. When I found out that the the Hausmanns were made in Taiwan I was very disappointed. While they are good quality, the ones I got from Wal-Mart are also good quality and do the job for alot less. If I have to buy foreign, I will try to spend the least possible."
2,Just OK,It has a middle part that doesn't work for me and could use a bigger nozzle so when in use it dosen't clog.
2,Like other shop-vac products it's overpriced,"This claw attachment has deep ridges on the outside, which keeps it high off the floor. One would need a powerful dust collector to pick up everything in one sweep. I quit using it and just use the end of the hose pipe to pick up heavy sawdust. I may use it later on the table to catch dust from my hand sander. This is made of thin stamped out plastic. I would not pay over $3.00 for another one."
2,Liked it but it ripped,"After using these sheets for one month, the corner ripped. This hasn't happened with any other bedding I've ever owned. I loved the pattern and was planning on making it a theme in my 2 year old's room - so I was disappointed."
1,So not a travel sheet,"I received my purchase the day before I left on a road trip, I am so glad I purchased multiple sheets from different places. This one came in and actually fits my sons full size crib. The description of this product is off"
4,Great place to start,"This is a very good place to start if you are just getting into computer graphics and you need a gentle introduction. I discovered it while reading the book 'Advanced Renderman...' in the section under mathematical preliminaries. The authors recommend it as a good introduction, and I would have to second that. The only gripe I have is that there are several annoying typos (which seems to happen all too often these days)."
4,Swoon....,Curtis Peoples has an amazingly smooth voice and emits talent with his lyrics and guitar playing.Highly recommend this album!
4,Smooth Sound,"Curtis Peoples' voice is one of the smoothest I have heard recently. He has lyrics that compliment it perfectly, and when you listen to him sing, the emotion rushes into you and you can not help but get caught up in the music. This compilation of songs is a perfect one and showcases the true talent that he has. One can only expect even better things from him as the years continue!"
2,Keep Coming Back Humor Book,Was not as humorous as I thought it would be. You should include more pages in your preview.
5,"""Cronic Dieter"" really says it all","I've read several books trying to figure myself out. Most people with EDNOS feel like nobody will ever understand what they are going through, when in fact there are thousands of us out there. I've Googled time after time trying to find out if ""dieting"" is addictive. I came across this book, and it spoke straight to me. I'm a dabbling binger, I am partly anorexic, and most of all I am a cronic dieter. She shares the steps it took her to recover from cronic dieting, and that you can heal in time. Very informative and helped me realize what friends I had that helped me stay trapped inside my own thin cage. I suggest every friend or family member with someone suffering from over dieting to read this book.5 stars."
5,The Thin Cage,"For anyone that has had an eating disorder or knows someone who has, you need to read this. It brings everything into perspective. I had starved myself and felt fat and lived a miserable life and now I feel so much better about being ""normal"" and not perfect.I think anyone can benefit from reading this book. You will see yourself and others a little clearer."
4,An Honest Look into the Heart and Mind of a Chronic Dieter,"If you are looking for a book that will give you insight into the heart and mind of someone struggling with an eating disorder then read this book. It is insightful, honest and heartfelt. It contains practical advice on analyzing your eating patterns, behaviors and thoughts that can begin to help a person struggling with an eating disorder to start down the road toward recovery and healing. The author challenges the reader to take a deep look inside and get to the heart of the matter, which is our own self image. And not just how we see ourselves but how we think others see us too. I recommend it for anyone who is wrestling with any type of eating disorder. You won't be disappointed."
3,It would have been great....,"This earpiece is decent to say the least. I would have given at least 4 stars if the earpiece would have been of better quality. Maybe my ears aren't large enough... no, the customer is always right so the earpiece was faulty. It would slide all over the place resulting in me constantly adjusting it in my ear. The sound quality is great if the phone is nearby... if the phone is more than 2-2.5 feet away the static kicks in big time. The only good thing about that is the person on the other line doesn't notive any deterioration until approxmately 5 feet. I would walk into my bathroom... which is ajoined to my room.... and would have a connection full of static. As I said before this headset would have received at least one more star had the earpiece been more practical... I can live with the poor performance when taking distance into consideration."
3,Cute but baby doesn't like it,"This product was so cute when my son used it, the problem is that it doesn't match with his other pacifiers and he doesn't use it. He will keep it in for a few seconds to snap a picture but not long. He is very attached to the Avent pacifiers."
3,"Cute, but I am not so sure that it is safe...",The pacifier is really funny but the plastic part with the teeth on the front is pretty small and almost seems like it could be a choking hazard to a child if they got it wedged in their mouth. It hasn't happened yet but I am just saying that it is small and I will definately watch my child closely when he is using it.
5,Fantastic! The best iv'e heard!,You should get this beautiful recording!It's the best!I might not have the Hightlights cd but I do have the compleate recording!Of course Ms. Paige gives a better interpretation of Grizabella.And Mr. Blessed is Old Dueteronemy!This is the''Dream Cast''!This recording also features the missing ''Billy McCaw''!And the original music to ''Mongojerrie and Rumpulteazer''.It also includes the original ''Addressing of Cats''!In all this is a must buy!But don't take my word for it buy it yourself and you'll see that this import is the best of the best!
4,Okay - good for the London Cast hankerers,"I am happy to see an abridged version of the Original London Cast recording of CATS available in the market, especially to the US market. I don't really consider this to be the finest cast recording, but I am willing to let the beginning purchaser and those who own the Broadway soundtrack try this out. I am a little bit more enthusiastic about the abridged London soundtrack because you needn't tire your ears and feel unhappy from listening to too much of its underpowerdness. Of course, we have Elaine Paige and Brian Blessed singing very well as Grizabella and Old Deuteronomy, and we have complete versions of ""Gumbie Cat"" and ""Ad-Dressing."" However, I would advise you to be aware of Paul Nicholas and Wayne Sleep, who sing with no feeling for the music. Overall, I would recommend this a little bit more than the 2-CD set, and for the general collector, the Broadway soundtrack, be it in complete and abridged versions, would be the first choice."
5,Cats,I like it but I have not reseved it yet and maybe i can get it in time for my brithday on the 24 of january. my daughter has a lot on her mind so if you cold send it to her it wold make her the happiest gril i know.
1,True stories?! I think not!,"I realize that this book was written in 1935. For any one looking to purchase this book please please please keep in mind that these supposedly ""true"" stories of American women are not true. While the women protrayed in the book are real historical figures, the stories about them are based on myth and legend, not on historical facts."
4,Review of Green's 'Laughter',"I was first made familiar with Green's skills as a writer through his more historical works on the age of Alexander. I opened this book with high expectations, and was generally satisfied. The work presents a writer with excellent voice and talent in storytelling. I really appreciate the historical detail of this work (even if occasional oversights occur... can Sappho describe a poker-face?). My one criticism: I thought the sexual element was overplayed; the work is seems first a story of sexual expression, and only then one of a Sappho the poet."
4,Fun movies from the 80's,It had been many years since I had seen this movie. It is funny and suspenseful with great performances by a lot 80's actors.
2,"""Disorganized Crime"" is a disorganized mess of a movie.","""Disorganized Crime"" is one of around 20 Mill Creek Entertainment low-budget Blu-ray titles that have turned up at dollar stores. According to the box, ABC TV Los Angeles, says that it is ""A Funnnnnnnnny Movie!"" Whatever. I thought it stunk. Maybe some grammar school kids might like this story of dumb crooks and dumb cops, but I can't see a broader audience for this movie.There would be potential for some laughs if the seven principle characters could do an episode of Hollywood Squares. Just put Whoopi Goldberg in the center square, stick Gilbert Gottfried in the empty seat and you would have ""A Funnnnnnnnny Show!""On the plus side, ""Disorganized Crime"" came in a high-quality Blu-ray box, complete with a locking tab. I give the box a 5-star rating."
4,always loved this movie,"I have always liked to watch this movie. It is just a fun 'murphy's law' type of movie and everything still works out in the end. A light hearted movie, but I wouldn't watch it with the kids."
2,Disorganized F$%* UPS!!,"Ok When I saw the Trailer for this Movie I thought it would Be Good cause they showed a Crash in the Trailer but when I bought it and watched it I saw that there was no Crash Scene in it and that really got me upset and the Person to Blaim for that would be the idiot Editor who took it out.The Movie would,ve went along fine if they didn't do that and thats why I gave it a Bad Rating it also had Bad Actors as well and Lou Diamond Phillips in it just ruined it he is Not a Good Actor he Sucks.So People thats my Rating for a Movie that I thought would be good but it turned out to be Trash.OH! and I might add to that the Action wasn't good either."
2,Disorganized Crime,"I bought this DVD based on the Customer Reviews in Amazon.com. I guess I just don't have the same sense of humor these people have. In all fairness, it has it's moments...although very few and very far between. The price in dollars I can live with. But, this DVD is a total waste of time. By the time it was over, it felt as though it was 3-hours long. If you have nothing better to do, watch it. That's what I did. To me, it wasn't worth it!"
5,One of my favorite comedies... Ever!,"There is no way you cannot enjoy this movie, the actors are all absolutely hillarious. (Ruban Blades is by far the best) What, at first, looks like just another run-of-the-mill crime caper, turns into a complicated action-comedy that doesn't have one unlikeable character. (Ed o'neil is also one of the best Characters)"
4,A Personal Criticism,"This is an excellent book. It is thoroughly researched, well documented and clearly written. However, I would have liked to have seen a chapter that included information regarding the Hebrew, Greek and Latin sources for the KJB. For example, what Greek documents were used by the translators? Which documents were referred to most often? How did the translators use or mis-use these manuscripts, and what part did they play in the many revisions of the KJB over the centuries? How reliable were these documents? Did the revisionists refer to the Textus Receptus, and if so, which versions of the TR did they use? Answers to questions such as these would have made ""A Textual History of the King James Bible"" even more interesting and informative.Dr. Theodore H. Mann"
4,Disturbing and Funny,"A disturbing and funny collection of three novellas, one for Purgatory, one for Limbo, and one for Hell. The first novella (The Priest's Story) slams back and forth through time as a Catholic priest attempts to reconcile his spotty past by murdering an old lady (and saving her daughter). In the second novella (Wake Up and Breathe), the narrator suffers from sleep apnea, and every time he wakes up, he is in a different time of his life with a different murder on his hands. In the last novella (The Gift Room), the reader is again tossed through time as a family implodes under the weight of absolute freedom and a fetishistic attachment to ""objects of affection."" Well worth buying. It will make you laugh, but you'll be looking over your shoulder the entire time."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I expected the photos to be sharper and was hoping to hear more about what was being viewed. The DVD is strangely designed (for example, the default soundtrack mode is music only and it's not immediately obvious there is a narrated track)."
2,No commentory,i was surprized that no commentory or subtitle to tell me what i am watching. may be it was my mistake that i didnt pay attention to the describtion of the disc content. but be careful.. it is exactly as the title says.. just a stargaze with some music :(
5,Excellent educational material,"an outstanding view of the universe, this DVD helps you to present ASTRONOMY to the public in elegant way, with its sharp images and space tune music people will travel with jaw-dropping thru space and time."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you suffer from insomnia, this DVD is perfect for you! I bought this thinking it would contain an interactive slide show of Hubble images. Wrong! It is just a mishmash of panned images to well-written but very boring music. Instead of showing complete images, the disk starts out zoomed in to one corner of an image and then slowly pans to the opposite corner. It does this for every picture!!! It never pulls back so we can see the whole image which to me is what Hubble pictures are all about. I couldn't stand any more than the first ten minutes because I couldn't stay awake."
1,Don't listen to the positive reviews-They are misleading.,"This is an expensive slide show with music. No voice or video just an option for onscreen narration you have to read. The music is nothing special, quite boring. The screen saver won't install and gives an error during the move data process. The web site does not have support. If you try and download the screensaver from the web site you get a bad link. So if you get a bad DVD like mine don't count on being able to use the screen saver."
5,Utterly beautiful! - but not a documentary.,"I suppose most science lovers like great, picturesque, documentaries; but this is not one. Sure all those quietly moving, revolving clear and sharp slides from the Hubble telescope are captivating and breathtaking. And the idea of including a new age music track definitely makes this meditative experience unforgettable. BUT I it is my humble opinion that a documentary track would have upgraded this stellar show a great lot, for seeing it the first time, at least! (Of course the reverse is also true: you can watch your favorite documentaries, like ""Cosmos"" or ""Hyperspace"" for instance, without sound, with the accompaniment of your favorite new age music...or Pink Floyd!) Try it on this one, fellow Space Travellers!"
5,Universally enjoyable.,"The fisrt scene already warms the soul. The music is awesome. They could not have chosen anything better. I think some people will look at these pictures of galaxies and stardust and go - oh, that's nice and forget about it once they switch of the TV, but others, like me will just sit in awe as you see the most spectacular visions of our universe. It really puts us humans and this little planet we live on in perspective. Who knows how many civilizations are in those pictures if we could only have zoomed in even more. A great DVD with the most beautiful music. Get it!"
5,Right on Christina,"Ever since I first heard this song on the radio, I have been in love with Christina Aguilera. Everything about her is great. She has the best voice out of any teen pop queen out there. She is a truly talented young woman who will go on to be very successful."
4,Effective self-help CD,I have found this CD to improve my overall daily state of mind. I find that I am less stressed on a daily basis and my ability to make quick and reliable decisions has also improved. Simply put; I feel more serene.
4,"similar to another I have, but...","This CD is similar to the guided meditation to help you sleep, also by Be. Naparstak, and I have found both to be very helpful, after, as she suggests on the CD, listening for several weeks, as I have. The imagery and music are somewhat alike, as well as the music, but, just different enough to carry you through and support you as you continue to listen. I do fall asleep faster, and I feel I sleep a little better, I pick it up from time to time, especially when very stressed; the cofidence CD will take longer for me, but I feel stirrings that it is working as it should-on an individual basis. I would recommend these two CDs, but all should realize that all health aids work in relation to how much you want them to work, and how many brick walls you have to knock down. I plan on ordering at least two more of her health journeys, I wish you success with any you try."

3,silicon grease,"I purchased this for use with my Scuba equipment. It's a great sized for pulling maintenance on my regs, flashlight, and camera at home. Also bought a smaller size to keep in my travel kit for emergencies."
4,great for O rings,I used to use petroleum jelly on the O ring for my whole house water filter. But then an expert told me that petroleum jelly is bad for the O rings. So I purchased this. It seems to go on good and makes a good seal. And if it allows me to go through *less* O rings throughout the years then it is a cost saver for me. I wonder if it comes in a larger container though?
4,trident silicone grease,I use this product to seal a snorkel mask to my face because I have a beard.It works fine and will not compromise the silicone liinng of the mask.
4,A great Halloween holiday book,"This book helps with early learning about the holiday Halloween. It is colorful and cartoon-like. Spot does not know what he wants to be for Halloween. Helen dresses as a fairy, Tom dresses as a Pirate, Steve dresses as a clown. Spot has some choices of what he wants to be, but finally decides on being a Wizard. Then off they go to trick-or-treat. This book is fun and exciting for a young child getting ready for Halloween and is appropriate for children ages 0-3,"
3,Spot misses the mark,"Eric Hill's original Spot books had a rough drawn charm and lots of ""lift the flap"" action. These new Spot books are not nearly as fun or cute as the classic stories and this one offers nothing beyond a VERY simple story of Spot choosing a costume to go trick or treating.There's not alot of text, the drawings are simple and commercial looking and there's just not alot to it. However, my kids do love Spot and while they were not as thrilled with this as they have been with other Spot books (Where's Spot, Spot's First Easter, Spot's First Christmas, etc). it's cute and atleast its relevant to the Halloween ""season"". I just wish there had been more to it."
2,Not Covering Any New Ground,"If you are a Larry Carlton fan buy his latest , ""Saphire Blue""... it is without a doubt his best. ""No Substitutions"" may have been great fun to watch live and record/perform but is a real 'widdle-fest' for bedroom guitarists. Most of these tracks are available on previous live LC albums, 'Last Nite' is a better live album. What is happening to SL? he plays with so much distortion and no subtlety, check out 'The Baked Potato Super Live' 1981 for SL's best fusion playing.For guitar heads only, not covering any new ground. Why this CD got an award I don't know. It is not bad, just self-indulgent."
5,Guitarist's Dream!,"This is a truly outstanding CD. The guitar playing of Larry Carlton and former Toto guitarist Steve Lukather is very melodic and intense. This live performance combines Carlton's jazz with some fantastic guitar playing by Lukather. The set up is simple, Carlton in your left speaker and Lukather in your right. It's all instrumental, produced and mixed by Steve Vai, and contains five songs for 60 minutes of pure enjoyment. If ever there was a true 5 star CD, this is it. Buy it, you won't regret it."
2,"At best, a mismatch.","I disagree with the other reviewers--I think the best thing about this album is that its short. What an odd combination. I admit I've never liked anything about Steve Lukather but to put him together with Larry Carlton is like ""Steve Vai & Pat Metheny...Live!"".I think its fair to say Larry Carlton is at his best when he works the solos out in advance (vs. live) but no question, he can be sublime at times. Luke hits everything with a sledgehammer, tons of distortion and everything sounds like a picking excercise from Guitar Player.Next time, how about Larry Carlton & Mike Landau? Or Frank Gambale or Eric Johnson or...."
3,Same old songs and not enough of them!,"I am a huge Larry Carlton fan, both as a session guitarist and as a solo performer (with the exception of some of his less successful acoustic Muzak) but this album is a bit of a disappointment. Three of the five tracks on this album were done on his ""Mr 335, Live in Japan"" album nearly 20 years ago. His repertoire must be sufficiently large that he could have picked tracks he hasn't done before. My biggest objection is that the album clocks in at just over 52 minutes which, in this age of 80-minute-capacity CDs is unforgiveable. Particularly so since Favored Nations is a label run by a musician (Steve Vai) as opposed to a bean counter. If a major label released such a short CD, there would be a fuss. For a small indie label, run by a musician, to do this shows little more than contempt for those who have bought it."
5,Lukather and Carlton deliver gold!!!,"First of all, Steve Lukather is still a member of the legendary rock band TOTO. Second, this effort with Larry Carlton (recorded in 1998) is a perfect example of what two masters of their craft can do when brought together. Like the liner notes state, they both checked ""their egos at the door"". Both have opportunities to show off their artistry, but the music is done in selfless fashion where neither dominates or tries to outdo the other. Couple this with a tight backing band and you have a cd worthy of play after play after play. Ladies and gentleman...GET THIS CD!!! ENJOY!!!"
4,Wonderful playing,"This is an energetic summit of outstanding guitar players. Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather play off one another beautifully. Both have enough similarities to sound great together, yet their playing is distinctive enough to give each solo variety and contrast. It never gets boring. One only wishes for one or two more songs. FavoredNations, how about a Volume 2?"
5,"It's NOT just a ""Guitarist"" album...","I'm not going to echo everyone else's raves here, as I agree with them. It's a shame, though, that Greg Bissonette has received virtually no mention in the previous reviews. Guitar Tour de Force that this effort is, Greg's drumming accompanying Lukather and Carlton is phenomenal! He is Mister Chops as far as I'm concerned, yet his playing is never intrusive or overdone. He has exquisite taste throughout this CD, and gets the chance to shine briefly toward the end of the second track ( as does the keyboard player, who might have been featured at least once more in this set ). This is the model for a drum solo: short, fiery and to the point. Top-notch band. Live jazz albums in an intimate club setting don't get better than this one."
4,"Despite lineage and friendship, an odd couple.","Two talented guitarists, but a live performance that is a bit schizoid. Lukather's often fierce rock splayings overpower Carlton's woody, muted noodling. The opening track, the Tony Hymas/Simon Phillips-penned ""The Pump"" (a Jeff Beck associated rock instrumental classic), is easily the best moment (worth the album all by itself). Luke, a Jeff Beck student, is on fire--big, fat in tone--- and quotes Beck extensively. Carlton seems uncomfortable and resorts to off kilter harmonies and tricks that do not do justice to the piece. The album quickly loses its energy from there, Carlton's watery ""jazz fusion"" influence takes over, and Lukather is forced to retreat. Nevertheless, there is plenty for guitar fans and students to study."
4,"Good, not great; Different than the other albums","This album isn't like Poem or Chimera or like the many older albums like Karma. It is a mix between the two favoring the older Delerium. Still, older Dererium fans will not like this album. But I do because Delerium successfully evolves their style, again.It isn't as upbeat or have as many vocals as Poem or Chimera. It isn't as gothic like old Delerium. Not all songs have lyrics, which makes it closer to old Dererium. It is still good. Not as good as Poem or Chimera, but close. Since I like new Delerium better, I would rank it better than Karma.This album continues the long-standing tradition of using female vocalists with great voices. The Mediaevil Baebes are back.If you like new Delerium, you owe it to yourself to get this. But, be aware, it is a lot different than Chimera."
1,Terrible.................,"To Those who are not familiar with Delerium old stuff....This Cd is just plain awful. Cheesy Electronics,and for some reason the newer Delerium turned Feminist....The old Delerium was More spirtual,And Deep, you can tell the music was tooken from life and had spirtual meaning rather than just corporate marketing,and feminist chanting,the old stuff had heartful electronic sound,i highly recommend the album faces forms and illusions.and spheres,those are beautiful Delerium albums......hopefully the old stuff will come back in print someday......Overall New Delerium Sucks.................."
4,Great Idea,"Great idea, but not such a great thing if your child wants to take more than a couple engines. The storage spots are too small. However, the idea is great. I just throw the trains in a baggie, and put them in the case. Durable and comes with a very neat building you can't buy separately. We make our own set, but this is a great beginning!"
4,A cat's eye view of the theatre and murder.,"_Nine Lives to Murder_ is a fast moving mystery set in theworld of English theatre. During an attempted murder,Winstanley Fortescue, a famous stage actor, butts foreheadswith Montmorency D. Mousa, theatre cat. Cat and man exchangebodies. Fortescue in a cat's body, must try to solve themystery and save his human body from further attacks. Thecat's point of view and the quirks and foibles of thetheatre world make this mystery a really good read."
4,light weight and good for traveling,This product was delivered in time and was what I expected. They don't have good traction for gripping but it serves it's purpose. They are a cool light weight flip flop to sport your favorite Baseball team.
3,Pretty Good,"What Kind Of Man Would I Be is A Great Song.Sadly the SLow-Jams have Overtaken Mint So it's Hard TO Really Appreciate their Overall Ability to Play Many Different Styles.Rick James,Earth,Wind&fire,Gap band,Lakeside,Ohio Players&ew Jack Swing among other styles among others you can Hear on them.Minneapolis is in THE HOUSE On Ain't Hookin'Me Up Enough which Sounds Alot Like PRINCE'S If I WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.Funky Weekend would fit Perfectly on A New Time Album.The SLow Cuts SHow More Originality than The Up-Tempo Stuff.Still You Gotta Give them Props For Being A Real BAND In These Watered-Down Days Of R-N-B.I Prefer the 2nd Disc Overall as their Best."
5,A very unique CD!,"Another job well done by Mint Condition! A great collection of jazzy, Carribean-type songs that really set them apart from other groups. I will be listening to their CDs for a long time to come! Their CDs are well worth the cash! Enjoy!"
4,Their Best Album Yet,"The band has found a comfortable niche in which to expand on their sound a little bit more than their last two albums. Stokley has it going on at the mic now and has really distinguished himself quite well as a soulful vocalist. The musicianship is top-notch and there's even bits of social commentary as are found in the two tracks, Raise Up and Missing. Overall, this album gets four stars just because it deserves it."
5,"For those who like their music fresh, not canned...","This band is like the Earth, Wind and Fire for the Gen-X generation: this album slams from start to finish!!! I mean, ""What Kind Of Man..."" is just the JAM!!! I also love ""Change Your Mind"", ""Gettin' It On"", ""Let Be The One"", ""You Don't Have To Hurt..."" This band has such warm, impassioned vocals, and the tracks are tightly arranged. Get this CD if you think that R&B is dead, and rejoice at these brothers that can bring about its rebirth. Give this band its props and buy this CD NOW!!! Support the real!!!"
3,Tasty but overcooked!,I like to make a quick salad using these tiny canned shrimps but the cans of shrimp I got were overcooked and tough. I have bought this product many times before at my local grocery store but this was the first time that the shrimps were actually tough and hard like they had been cooked for too long. Normally I would recommend these tiny canned shrimps but if Crown Prince has changed it's preparation for some reason......I can not say that I would recommend these any longer.
1,Don't waste your money!!!,Vanity publication and advertisement for parties (who are) more interested in self-promotion than education. Sophomoric descriptions and overly inflated prices for less than mediochre examples of touristy junk.
2,Original or reprint,The original books are produced by the Austin Motor Company or the British Motor CompanyReprints are by Brooklands and have an extra last page stating the reproduction datesDo ask the seller explicit confirmation if you want an original
2,It's okay,"This sorter is much bigger and more space-consuming that what I expected from the picture and description. It takes up a lot of room, does not come with paper coin rolls, is made from cheap material, is not automatic, and the occasional coin hits the floor. For someone wanting something inexpensive more for entertainment than anything else, I'd recommend it, but if you want something for a business or whatnot, definitely find something more expensive--it'll be worth it for the quality."
3,Good for Birthday Parties,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered these, but I thought it was one pair of sunglasses. Instead, it was 4 pairs. Unlike the sunglasses you purchase for kids, these were more the party favor kind that you would give for a birthday party. Cute, but they can't be worn outdoors because they don't have the protective lenses. My daughter loves them for dress-up and she has 4 pairs in case they break, though."
5,Great value and dogs love them,I have given my dogs Pet-Tabs for 10 years. They love the taste and it gives them the extra vitamin's they do not get in their everyday diet.
2,not great,"If youre expecting a lot of gore and violence then dont buy this film as it is very tame .It is directed by antonio magherti - the man who directed cannibal apocalypse (which is a great film) so i had high expectations, unfortunately these werent met. Worth a look and quite enjoyable but nothing special ......."
1,it is 19 years old,i have a lot ot say about this cd i bought it and reallised it was compleately differant to the video cast and then i realised it was 19 years older and my faviourite song is mrmistoffelees but on this cd there is a whoe verse of music missed out where jacod brent dances i was very dissopionted at this. i want realyy usefull company to make a new cd which is the same as on the video. plese e mail me on your views.
2,Fun like a root canal.,"This show pains me. It was inovative in its time but has become somewhat of a parody of itself. ""Memory"" was beautiful once...now it's an ulcerous lump on the proverbial love handles of Broadway. With shows like ""Ragtime"" coming out there is no place for these stale representations of Lloyd Webber's talent...or lack thereof. Like most, I do enjoy Webber's works...however, I find that after a while they all start sounding the same. Gradually pop influences have found there way into his works and key themes from shows seem to find there way into the scores of so-called ""new"" musicals. If Webber wants to get his popularity back to it's status during the days of ""Phantom..."" then he needs to go back to his former style. A la ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". One that works. Think before you write."
2,It sounds as dated as it is...,"It probably is best to wait awhile before thinking that some ""musical"" is a classic. It has been now some 30 years since the release of this title and the passage of time has decidedly not been good to this recording. In fact, it makes you wonder if your 'ears"" were deceiving you back then. Of course, there's still ""Memories"" and all that but other than that the recording simply doesn't stand the test of time."
2,ho-hum...i was bored with it,"Though Elaine Paige was phenomenal in the song ""Memory"" the rest of the cd was boring. Would someone please tell me the plot of this musical? The songs got very boring, very quickly. I could not follow anything that went on in the play since the music doesn't fit into a story. I would not reccommend wasting your money on ""Cats""! Find some other soundtrack for a different musical."
3,Old songs...,"This recording has slower songs than the modern version of the musical. The songs are also a bit different from the modern version. Compared to the video, this recording seems boring. Yet I like it, because the vocals are good. Rumpleteazer's voice is childish and very nasal, but Demeter's voice is beautiful."
3,"""MEMORY"" DOES IT ALL","A good musical, yet not the greatest by Lloyd Webber. Actually, the song ""Memory"" is the only one in our memories. The rest seems to me quite average. We should have in mind that a few years later Webber wrote wonderful songs for each one of his musicals: PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, SUNSET BOULEVARD and the unfortunate WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND, besides his previous masterpiece, JESUSCHRIST SUPERSTAR, with almost an entire collection of classical and marvelous songs. I saw CATS in Broadway back in 1992 and I saw it again last year here in Chile: I guess some cats were left on the plane on their way down here because the southamerican tour production looked quite poor compared to the Broadway version. It was shown in a huge arena and in a frontal stage, quite different to the half-circled and smaller Winter Garden Stage."
2,Did I read the same book as the reviewers?,"I do not understand the glowing reviews of this book. I felt neither engaged nor moved by her vignettes of her life in Key West. It's like going to lunch with someone who talks nonstop about herself, her husband, her ex, her kids, her job, blah blah blah. Boring.I've been to Key West 4 times and believe me, this book doesn't even begin to impart a feeling for the town. Don't buy this book to help you plan a vacation to Key West. The only nice thing I can say is it's a good read for people with short attention spans. Most of the chapters are only 2-3 pages long."
2,not as advertised,"this was not what i was led to believe it was. it was two movies not the one i ordered. i already had one of them. i collect old b and w horror and the case is important to me. this one was not very good. i could not play it on my dvd, although it said all regions. it did however play nicely on my computer. too much trouble to send back.delevery was v ery fast."
1,Dark Was the Night,"Willie Johnson has a knack for the blues, unfortunately he has No Voice, No sense of orchestration, No budget for background vocals or instrumentation, and unfortunately the songs sounded as though they were just being rehearsed. Ok, he sang them front to back, but this CD was a huge waste of money to purchase AND to produce!! There was not a single song worth while. I kept hoping as I listened to the full CD. Painful!!!!Sorry Willie."
4,Eerie Stuff,"Unlike almost anything you've ever heard. Blind Willie Johnson's life story is almost an exaggeration of the sad, hard lives that have made wonderful blues music. Read the liner notes of this cd and weep for this poor man. His hardships make the music - from joyful gospel to unbelievably intense blues/spirituals - all the more amazing."
4,Exactly as promised,"The bar is exactly what it's supposed to be. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it came wrapped up in so much shrink wrap and tape that getting it ready for use was a bit of a chore. I required a knife to get all the plastic wrap off, which led me to accidentally slice the rubber washers at the bar ends - it's not a big deal at all, but it could have been easier. Otherwise I'm very happy with this bar."
5,Their best to date,Buy this CD first. Start it on track 2 and play through to track 13 for an great hour of dance. YELLO tends to talk too much on their Albums. Not this one. Of over 2000 Cd's in my collection it's in my top 5.
3,Yello seems to be on vacation.,"This Album seems to lack the effort put into past albums. There is a lot of ""borrowed"" sounds from other albums that made this album ""stale"" and a little boring at times. Don't take this the wrong way, I've been a Yello fan since 1984 and have been quite impressed with past albums, it's just that this one could have used a little more work...sorry, Boris and Dieter, better luck next time."
3,Pocket Universe,"Yello's answer to Enigma and Deep Forest? Or their way to mark the passage into earnest middle-aged spirituality?Surely all that chanting and references to Rupert Sheldrake, Heisenberg and Galileo are just as tongue-in-cheek as the usual delicious Yello irreverance?Somewhat repetitive rhythms, perhaps intended for techno-trance intergalactic meditation?Buddhists beware !"
1,BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK,I ALSO HAVE TO USE THIS BOOK FOR MY CLASS AND I'VE HAVENT EVEN GOT PAST CHAPTER 1. I GET LOST IN WHAT EVER POINT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO MAKE WHY DO THEY HAVE TO MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED.
4,structured cobol programming : for the year 2000 and beyond,identification division environment division select claus
4,Worth a try,"I play somewhat hard but not as hard as other drummer's I know or have seen play. Every couple of months I was forced to order new springs because they just gave out on me. That could have easily been related to the spring tension I liked at the time, but I don't even know what that was. So, I ended up switching to this heavy-duty spring. I eventually ended up breaking a few of these when I was playing every single day, but I haven't had to replace any since then (I play 2-3 times a week at the moment). I do miss the lighter spring's feel, but this spring seems to be more durable overall and is worth a try if you break springs."
1,Disappointed,"The PDA wouldn't charge up at all. I was very disappointed. Although it was in it's original packing, the product itself was quite old."
4,Age-appropriate,"Well-written, helpful for students approx 8 years and up. Good refresher for the rest of us, as well as good explanations of some of the Amendments to the Constitution."
4,So California Gardening 101,"I have just returned to San Diego after years in Texas. Before I left, I had little to no gardening experience here. This book has been a wonderful tool to get me on my way in a new gardening environment. The information is clear, concise, and has already saved me from making what would have been several ""newbie"" mistakes! I am so glad I found this great resource!"
2,eh. . .,"I suppose with their legions of pissed off fans who love this album they're doing something right . . . however I can't figure out what it is. The lyrics are trite and screamed sans melody. the music, though short, fast, and obnoxious (which I usually enjoy), stagnates, and by the end of the first minute of each tune has said everything it is going to. After buying this album, I was very mad at the person who reccomended it to me. To all those reading this, I would suggest the Cro-Mags Age of Quarrel/ Best wishes and to save your money on this purchase."
3,It's all right I guess.,"I think that the cd is all right, especially the songs Pauly the Dog and Bloodsucker"
3,Not the Most Hardcore Thing You'll Ever Hear...,"For fans of other Epitaph bands like Pennywise and Nofx, and whatever other poppy crap is trying to be passed off as Hardcore, this album might sound pretty tough. But for fans of early Agnostic Front (Liberty and Justice For..., One Voice, etc...) then this album seems kinda limp. A good effort by the boys at making a comeback, and kicking it old school style while trying not to sound like its still 1985, because of course, it ain't. You have to remember, the band broke up in 1993, and decided that they loved hardcore too much to end it completely. I would have prefered if the A.F. boys had gotten together under a new name, but I guess this is their way of preserving their legacy with the new generation of Hardcore youth. Its not bad, a helluva lot better than a knife to the liver, but get this AFTER you've heard their early stuff."
1,Hardcore isn't supposed to be stupid...,"however this album is. Hardcore's come a long way since The Misfits, Bad Brains, Cro-Mags, etc. . . And it's really gone down hill. ""Believe"" has to be one of the most irritating songs out there(you ""Believe hardcore's the way"" huh? Good for you; now what is the point of this song?) Overall, I'd rather get a root canal than listen to this album again."
3,Disappointing!,"I thought there would be more ""there"" there, but I was sorely disappointed. It was mostly a long interview with Barbra with only some shots of her recording with the orchestra, and even those were interrupted. I was hoping this video would include more of her music and more of her at the recording studio. I was truly disappointed in this and would not really recommend it to Streisand fans."
2,Dont bother!,"I expected more from Streisand and all I got is a 40 min. video that isnt entertaining at all.If you are going to buy this video buy it only because you will get the chance to see the ""Somewhere"" music video."
5,An excellent resource for the PHP/XML programmer.,"I have very much enjoyed using this book. It is written in easy to understand language, but it is certainly not dumbed down either.I found the example code used to be extremely succinct. This contrasts sharply with many other technical books that use either numerous code examples where more explanation would better serve the reader or not enough examples to illustrate a point.The information covered is also quite comprehensive, covering everything from the very basics of XML structure and usage up to advanced XML used in RSS, WDDX, XML-RPC, and defining web services using SOAP. This book includes everything you'll need to know to integrate with many current web services or build your own."
2,The Worst of Billy Joel,"Seriously, these have to be Joel's worst albums. ""Storm Front"" is okay but the first two are ridiculously excessive and very unnatural sounding. This is Billy Joel at his most boring, adult-contemporary stage."
3,RITE LITE Wireless Picture Light,"The first light was terible. One LED didn't work at all, the light would go on and off without even touching it, or when my hand was near but not on the switch. The dim positiion did not work at all.When informed of the situation, the company was very good. They sent another light immediately, saying thst it wasn't necessary to return the old light. The new light works as it should and I am pleased with it."
1,Far too dim,I needed this light to be mounted over a dartboard to better illuminate the playing area. It didn't make much of a difference. Must now look for another.
2,Rite Lite LPL600G 6 LED,"The picture lights are wonderful. However, some are brighter than others. Some light-up my paintings beautifully and some DO NOT. The brightness of the lights varies greatly from one to another."
1,FIRST AND LAST BUSINESS PURCHASE,"I ordered this item for my business and PAID FOR next day air...because MY BUSINESS NEEDED IT THE NEXT DAY!!!...On the afternoon that it was scheduled to be delivered, I was informed that I will not be receiving it for 3 MORE DAYS...THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. How is a business supposed to be successfull if its vendors can't fill a $23 order and get it delivered on time. I highly douthat I will ever be using Amazon's Business services in the future."
4,RITE LITE,"I chose this light because it is to be shipped overseas to light a small picture. It is light in weight, very compact and because it is battery operated it will not need an adaptor. It fits the bill and does the job, however it would not be suitable for a larger picture. That said, I am very happy with my purchase."
2,Far from perfect,"The product does what it says and worked fine. The blueish LEDs are not the warm incandescent look that many expect but you can buy (from elsewhere) theatrical gel sheets to correct the color to what you want. What I don't like is that it doesn't allow you to choose between battery or AC, and the arm is not sturdy enough to hold the light in the right spot when you are turning on or off the light."
3,the right color temperature for picture lighting?,I planned on ordering two of these for picture lighting but got to thinking about the color of an led light source. I have an led drop light that works great but the color is very blue (high color temperature). Picture lighting is best when a warmer light source is used...like incandescent. Not sure the bluish source will do the painting justice.
3,light out already,"i love this item, however one of the led lights does not work and I just got it today. Im not sure how to have a new one sent.. can someone help?"
1,Total plastic crap,"I would not recommend this item at all. When you insert the batteries for the first time, they are in there forever.The light does not adjust well, and clipping it on is a pain in the ***.Do not purchase this piece of crap."
1,not so good,i ordered 3. each came with a diffrent shade of green light emiting led bulbs...stunk. battery life on these is...non-existant. will eat your batteries. stay away
2,Not so great,"The lighting started out nice and bright, but in a matter of just a few hours use, it has dimmed to the point that one can hardly tell that it is on."
3,Not very bright.,"I loved how this clips on to the picture, and that I did not have a cord coming down. It is made very well, but the light is dim and batteries wore out too fast in light of the fact that it was not on very long."
2,Weak Light Poor battery life,"This light is not sufficient to light a large frame. I would not use this on any framed art greater about 20X24. Also, the 3 AAA batteries last only about 8 hours. That means, after 3-4 evenings on high, the batteries need to be replaced. Very disappointed."
3,Expected it to be better,Overall good book. Neuro is surprisingly very poorly written. Lacks a section on optics. Images could've been better. Pediatrics and strabismus section is great.
5,Definitely worth it,"The only downside to this radar detector is to set the compass. You will need a retail store parking lot (empty) to drive in circles (3 times) to set the compass. After that the radar detector is such a beauty. It will detect all the bands specified in the description, I know it for a fact. It will detect a speed radars about a mile and a half away in any direction. In open highway it will go as far as 2 1/2 miles. This product has definitly saved me from several tickets."
1,Does not detect LASER!!!!!!!!!!!,"This worked pretty decent for a while and it did detect radar and saved me once or twice. But i eventually came across a cop who used a laser and he got me with it :( . The detector didnt even go off once. no beeps no nothin! Do not buy this. It's not worth the trouble. It also beeps way too much, picking up automatic door radar signals more than anything else. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for another detector. I might just go for a signal jammer myself."
3,average,"I got this product after a speeding ticket. I goes off too much in the city , so I only slow when the level go's above 1 . You will be alerted to Laser, but really have no chance to slow in time. Overall it is better for highway use. Too many things use radar these days and its hard to get something that will detect just the fuzz . Its worth every penny though . Go for it . If only they made a breathalizer/radar detector combo. The pigs wouldn't get any of my money ."
3,Loco Review,Her ukulele skills are awesome on the cd. The only minus is the singing; her vocals accompanied by others kinda ruins some of the songs...sounds to generic.
3,Jews of Kaifeng,The book has loads of facts but I found it read more like a textbook than a summer reading book
3,All the bells and whistles and false alarms galore,"This radar detector has lots and lots of features. I wish the false alarms weren't one of them. I've ended up disabling many of the detection methods because I haven't found an incidenence when those additional methods saved me. For example, VG2 detection seemed to go off a lot and the only thing I could see is other people with radar detectors anywhere near me. It detects what it says it does, you just need to learn real from fake with this one. I want my low end Whistler radar detector I gave my wife back. When it went off, it was the real deal."
5,good product,"It is very sensitive detector and full selection of so many function. The price is great aslo. When you traveling on freeway, it is better to set X band alert off to get rid off false alert from nearby local radar. Each time, when you heard Ku or Ka alert, you can find the patrol car in half minute."
5,Works Better Than Expected,"I was nervous about purchasing a detector. I bought a couple of cheaper ""in-store models"" before that didn't work at all. But, after reading the reviews here I felt confident about purchasing this one.This detector works great. I received a warning that was almost a half-mile away! And, Amazon offered the cheapest price (plus I had a special offer code.) I also received free shipping, which was great! They said in the confirmation e-mail that it would take a couple weeks to receive it, but I received it in less than three days!It's a great product! But, I would advise anyone who buys it not to speed just because you have a detector. They only detect if a radar or laser is turned on. If an officer is timing you between two points, there's no warning at all unless you see him. Use it as a ""safety device"" but use it with confidence!"
2,Cobra Radar Detector,I have been using this radar detector for about 2 years now. It gives alot of false alarms. I will definitely go with the Escort next time
2,bad sensitivity at low temperatures,"When outsite temperature is around 0 Celsius degrees or below, and the car and the unit it's not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange, it gives sudden false alarm like K 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 55 5 0 0 0 , Ku alarm 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm. And sometimes when on the highway , from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength 5 5 55 5 and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller .the spiral coil it's not good to short , you need a straight onemaybe the scale would be better if it was from 0 to 9"
2,Not worth the money,"I recently bought this unit after returning 2 defective 9430 models by Cobra and I'll have to say there is no improvement as I had thought. My impression was 'pay more and get a better product' but in this case that is not true. This detector gave me nothing more than a series of false alarms or no alarms. When radar was detected correctly, it was either too late (less than 1/4 mile) or the alert signal did not increase as I approached the radar making me think it was another false alarm. Thankfully Cobra covers their units for one full year and it is on its way back for replacement. I will say that their customer service is much better than my luck with their radar detectors. I spoke to a live rep right away, something rare to get these days! A UPS postage paid sticker was sent right out to me. I hope the replacement unit works correctly."
4,Good item for the price,"Decent performance, some faulty x bands, but has worked many times to save me from a ticket :)"
5,5 stars,Awesome product...works great. Make sure to lock your car or take out of sight...mine was stolen out of my truck. I have to buy a new one. Boooo
5,The Best Radar Detector,I had Cobra products but this is the best one so far. But I will point out that customer support from the manufacturer was the highlight of purchase of this product. Since I have Nissan Z and it required longer leads to reach the lighter. I emailed them and they sent one immediately. Due to some reason it did not reach me earlier so I again sent an email. In couple of days I received 2 leads one after the other. This kind of service is hard to find. 5 stars to customer support.Cobra XRS-9930 12-Band Radar/Laser Detector
4,GREAT product,"Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new laser detector. It's very user friendly and the ""voice"" alert is wonderful -- you don't have to worry about looking at the detector to see what type of signal it has picked up as it is told to you by the voice alert.Of note, it is a bit bigger than most detectors, but it is well worth the extra size. The size being a bit bigger than the other detectors on the market is the only reason that I didn't give this a 5 star rating."
3,Cobra XRS-9930 12-Band Radar/Laser Detector ( compass ???),Seems to work OKYou can not use the compass if you use your rear window defroster .I have tried it in two cars and when you turn on the defroster the direction will reverse .
1,Do your research!!!,"Due to their wide availability and good marketing the cobra name has become synonymous with good radar detectors to most people. Ignore the ratings on amazon, most radar detector enthusiasts will agree that cobra makes a sub-par product. Whistler, beltronics, and escort make products in the same price range that offer much better detection. Again, don't take my word for it - do some research online and see what the people who actually test radar detectors have to say."
2,Too Expensive,Cobra XRS-9830 12 Band Radar and Laser 8 point electric compass.You need to search other web sights besides Amazon.There are other sights much cheaper.You live and learn!
3,Cobra XRS-9930 12-Band Radar/Laser Detector,"it's o.k. don't understand it yet,but it's o.k.""m m m it make a like of noise?"""
2,Vanga review,This is not a great detector.. overall simple thing is that if you can detect cops radar it means that you alread been detected by cop.360 range is not so good as this doesnt detect the cop radar if he is in the opposite lane in highwayStraight range is ok.. it catches with in 1/2 mile
1,"POOR and USELESS, NOT a GOOD PRODUCT",i don't recommend to buy this product to anybody. it is a poor and a useless one. i got this product for a month now and installed it to my car right away when i got it and used it everyday going to work and drive around. i was so excited to use it for the first time but i got frustrated when i use it. i tried every settings it had and they worked the same. just keep on annoying but there's no cop you can see around and when there is a cop it is silent. i give one star just for the design and look.
3,DOES NOT RUN ON BATTERIES!!!,This is a decent detector; but if you were looking for a cordless / battery powered detector this is not it!!! For some reason the detector has a battery power indicator (it's for an external battery like in a car not for internal battery like the product spec would lead you to believe). What the F&^@* my car has a battery indicator I don't needs a radar to tell me the condition of the car battery!!!
1,cibi,"this is not a good deviceit will not cover 360 degree anglei will not recomend this product to anybodywhen i gone for a long trip, one policeman detecting the speed with his gun in I-75, but i didnt get any signal from my detector. anyway i loose my money on it.dont buy these item, because you will defenitely waste your money."
3,No me parecio tan bueno al menos hasta el momento.,"Soy de Argentina y le veo que tiene una reacción muy lenta al menos con los radares de Camaras de Fotos montadas en auto aca en la Argentina, más precisamente en Buenos Aires. Le falta alcance me avisa a menos de 1 KM de distancia, otra de las cosas tendrían que enviar un manual para America Latina, no todos entendemos el inglés.Saludos, Marcelo desde Argentina - Bs. As."
4,Cobra Gets It Done,"This device lets you know if the police have radar on (they do not always have it on). The Emergency Vehicle warning is helpful, but not all have the device to set it off. The compass is most used... Very easy to set up. Good unit for the money!"
1,Not a good detector if the display burns out prematurely.,"Overall This is a great detector, a little bulk and funny looking, but works exactly as it is supposed to. I have had many detectors over the last 20+ years, and this is the best one yet.The only real complain I have is: the graphic display burned out after a year. This is extremely annoying. It is tough to ""see"" what's going on without the display. The repair cost would exceed getting a new unit.I am now shopping for a new detector, and I am staying away from the complex graphical display, and stay with the simpler LED display models."
2,Radar Detector,This radar detector looks good but the display did not work. I found that this is a wide spread problem with these radar detectors. I don't suggest buying one of these. Buy a Escort or Valentine if you want a great radar detector.
1,One of a kind battery,"I have owned one of these lanterns for about a year now. The battery SEL CB3-6 seems to have been manufactured for this lantern only. I have searched the internet for over an hour and cannout find a replacement. The Vector company was bought by Black & Decker in 2006. They are now owned by DeWalt. ServiceNet handles parts and is useless for parts for the Vector. Apparently, once the battery dies, so does the lantern."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this for my mother who was suffering from Parkinson's Disease. She needed a lift in spirit and a reason to smile. Suffice to say, this audio CD is pretty much useless - she found it annoying after a mere 15 minutes. And so did I.What's on it? Silly audio recordings of children giggling. Over and over and over. If I wanted that, I would of gone down to the park and recorded kids playing on the jungle gym set.This is kind of like taking a tape recorder and recording rush hour traffic. Really, its that bad and not very clever. Save your money."
3,transitions require more time to align band,"I own several 10 minute solution dvds, that I truly enjoy doing. Thetone trouble zones, was a bit disappointing as she moves from one position to the next too quickly and it was difficult to get the band and posture right. I had to replay each segment twice in order to get the correct alignment of the band and enough reps to feel the work.Not a bad workout, just not as effective as the other dvds that I've tried from this collection. I recommend the pilates and kickboxing workouts from 10 minute solution."
4,Great workout,"I really liked this DVD. The moves really work the targeted muscle and I feel my arms are more toned doing this DVD versus free weights. It also gets your heart going. I burned approximately 250 calories doing the entire DVD (according my my heart rate monitor).Minus one star because she moves into the next moves quickly and it can tricky to do at times with the band. But once you get used to the sequence it shouldn't be a problem.Also, once this starts getting easier you MUST buy a higher-resistance band because the one provided is light. Your workout will definitely get harder!!!! That's the point of resistance bands."
4,Another excellent 10 Minute Solution,"I bought this for Lady Hardbody, for the days that I don't train her (e.g. am on travel/whatev). The 10 Minute Solution series is a superb way to plan workout sessions, and even to integrate various elements of fitness from several conditioning platforms (e.g. flexibility, strength, cardio). The only ""beef"" I have with this DVD is that the resistance band that comes with the DVD is pathetic. Expect to have to go out and buy a stronger one.[...]."
2,Not Intense- Easily pulls muscles,"I like the idea of resistance band excercising, but her movements just don't flow. Almost every time I did this video I ended up pulling a muscle. (I usually do weights/cardio 5 times a week and was going to use this to try to mix things up a little bit)"
2,Disappointed,She moves so quickly from movement to movement it is hard to get the exercise band correctly. I would find it annoying to possibly pause the DVD player constantly.
2,"disappointed - D. Larson - Oconto, WI","I purchased this dvd in December & after 2 uses the band has a lot of pinholes in it. It does not stay in place very well when doing some floor exercises. The exercises themselves are good, but she doesn't really take time to explain the moves, it may take a few times to understand the moves & be able to keep up. I prefer using my Richard Simmons Tone & Sweat video, I feel like I've really worked out when done with that tape."
3,10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones,"It is just alright. Nothing that challenging and if you need just a quick workout, it will do."
