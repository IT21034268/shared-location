1,"Quicken 2007 is so slow, and full of bugs","I have been using quicken for over 10 years now. I was very happy with Quicken 2004 until Intuit forced me to upgrade to 2007. If I didn't upgrade, all of the online updates will not work.Now I am stuck with a buggy software and I can't go back to 2004 :("
1,Quickn 2007 Download,"I purchased Quicken 2007 Download and got a refund within three days of trying to use it. The windows kept merging into each other. The images would keep shifting. I uninstalled and re-installed and it was no better. I called tech support. They had me uninstall and re-install, but no changes. The customer rep also was going through the same process on his end, and reported the same problem. He was trying to convince me to keep using the software and wait for updates. I got a refund. Such a shame that they couldn't fix it."
1,Bad support,"If you have an older version of Quicken, beware. This product does not work with some versions and the support line has no solution and wastes a lot of your time before they let you know it won't work."
1,"AVOID 2007 AT ALL COSTS, PAST VERSIONS WERE GREAT, THIS ONE SUCKS.","I've been a user of quicken for at least ten years. I've liked the product historically, but this version is garbage. Like other users, I too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error. Guess what? There's nothing I can do. I can't go back to a previous version of Quicken, because my data file isn't compatable.Honestly, I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first. I was brand loyal to Intuit, but now I'm paying the price. The software is garbage, stay away.Update: No thanks to Intuit, I was able to discover 'super validate' functionality which fixed my problem. To perform a super validate, copy your file to another folder for backup, and than hold control-shift while clicking on the validate function accessable from the toolbar."
3,More bugs...,"I've been using Quicken for the past 11 years. Everything is there. I recently upgradede from the 2003 basic version, mainly because of this version's planning feature. Turns out I can't use it as every time I'm setting up my profile, and click DONE, the program shuts off. I spent $62 bucks on this; I don't regret it but still think might have been better off with my old basic 2003 version."
2,Ho Hum,As an upgrade this product is a waste. There is hardly any difference from 2006! Don't waste your money. If you are buying for the first time it is ok.
3,Migrated from 2004 to 2006 instead of 2007,"I have not yet tried Quicken 2007. but based upon other reviews, i was hesitant to do so. with Quicken 2004 online access about to expire, i needed to do something.I decided to be risk adverse and migrate to Quicken 2006 instead. I'm very happy with that decision. It installation was clean, my 15 years of data migrated cleanly, the version seems stable, and it has some nice incremental improvements over 2004.i can certainly recommend a migration from 2004 to 2006. i'll be forced to migrate again in 2 years instead of 3 years, presumably, but hopefully it will be another stable version."
2,I couldn't register,"I tryed to register the product but as my adrs. is beyond the USA borders it was not accepted, so I registered it with a friend's adrs. which I think is not fear. About the ""user's Manual"" the say that there is one included in the pakage, and there wasn't any, tryed to download it from the web but the site is not avaliable for me.Victor Cohen"
2,Beware: online downloads are deactivated after 3 years,"I've generally enjoyed Quicken products, but they've started deactivating the online downloads after 3 years, forcing you to upgrade or enter transactions by hand. I've NOT seen this noted on the retail box or in the license agreement, so it can be a bit of an unpleasant surprise when you get the ""upgrade or else"" letter from Quicken!"
1,Disappointed Is an Under Statement Never AGAIN!,The few 5 star ratings on this product must be Quicken Employee's. This version is crap. I was very happy with my last three versions of quicken but this is a disaster. I would have continued to use my 2004 version until 2008 when I plan on purchasing a new computer but Intuit made that impossible with their forced shut down of basic functions. I understand if they don't want to support a version but to take away basic download functions from banks and brokers is ridiculous. NEVER AGAIN will I purchase a product from them. I have a used version of 2007 deluxe for sale CHEAP :) I need to purchase some Raid for all the bugs this programs has.
1,"Why, oh why did I upgrade","Ok, after believing that the Q2007 version could connect to my HSBC account, I bit. Bad, bad dog. I have spent hours online with Quicken, HSBC and my other banks. My main checking account seems to be always flagged for other transactions, but none exist. HSBC now says the only way I can get the info is manually download from their site. Tonite, for some odd reason, I no longer have a password vault with passwords and pins for all my online accounts. In addition - the upgrade/hiccup seems to have deleted all my online payees that I will now have to manually reenter, since my last backup brings the data back, but not the payees. I have been using Quicken since it came out and this has got to be the worst upgrade yet."
1,Frustration with software bugs and LOUSY tech support,"I have been using Quicken since 1999 very happily. Unfortunately, I decided to upgrade from 2005 to 2007. It will not let me print reports, and every time I try, it crashes my computer. I spent over 5 hours on the phone with Tech Support in India and they just kept running through their pre-scripted solutions which never fixed the problem. Now I'm going back to using 2005 and will lose all the data that I entered since I upgraded to 2007. I'm VERY unhappy with this product and with how Intuit handled (or didnt' handle) my problem. Stick with your current version. Quicken is a great product, but the 2007 version has too many problems."
1,Wretched.,It's definitely an awful piece of software. It's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7. Follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06.
1,Finally they admit to having a huge BUG!,"After three phone calls to their India based customer support, they admitted that the product has a major BUG! It will not back up your precious data file from within the program. They promised a pop up would show up soon; notifying the user that a patch was ready.We are still waiting..............."
2,Weak effort,"Quicken is annoying in that it could be so much better. Setup was not as simple as they advertise, particularly if your financial institutions don't play exactly well with their system. The package contains NO documentation. For new users, learning to use the system requires the download of a manual that doesn't exist online anymore, or relying on community message boards full of angry customers. Plus, the software is full of tie-ins to Quicken's ancillary services that clutter the interface and feel like advertising on the inside of a fully-priced product. Customer support is perfunctory and poor. The interface is ugly and uninspired. Hopefully they'll do better on the next one, but you have to wonder if they ever bothered to test this on new users (or any users, really)."
1,UPGRADES AS PROFIT CENTER,"I am giving Quicken a 1 star for its marketing model.I am an owner of Quicken 2004 and am frustrated that my 2004 software's functions will not be supported, so I have to upgrade to 2007. I don't care about the live support, or the software upgrades, but I do want the ability to download my financial data. I think Quicken should disclose the fact that software they sell will have a three year life span and users could decide if they want to invest in using the software.I for one will be seeking another product in the future, but for now I guess Quicken 2007 will be my software for another term."
1,Great Functions That Don't Work,"Doesn't connect to bank. It did it once, just enough to get all my data entered, budget planned, hours of planning and effort. Won't connect anymore. I can't even download files and then import them. It asks me to setup a new account each time I try to import, because no matching accounts exist. Then it won't allow me to set up the account because it already exists.This is a highly flawed product at this point."
4,Seems good to me,"Perhaps I like this product because I have never used Quicken before, but I think it is rather easy. I did have some trouble getting a couple of my accounts to sync on the first attempt, but after going through it again it worked great.The main feature I was interested in was household budgeting and tracking. I used Microsoft Money before this and this is such a tremendous upgrade in how easy it is to setup the budget and track spending."
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware: Intuit will use your ""registration"" information for aggressive marketing purposes, and refuses to remove customer name/addresses from marketing lists. Intuit cannot be trusted with customer information, therefore be very wary of trusting them with any information. This is especially problematic because the software company is also aggressive about insisting that you send them ALL of your financial information as an ""online backup."" Since they cannot be trusted with such basic information as name/address/phone/email they cannot be trusted to keep-secure more sensitive information. If a business will not respect customer privacy with regard to advertisements, how can one trust them to keep bank account numbers, credit card numbers, bank account passwords, etc,? If you do buy this product it would be advisable NOT to provide them with accurate personal information (most especially an email address). Again, buyer beware."
1,Be aware,"Be aware if you are planning to switch from MS Money. This version doesn't let you convert the data easily. The CS told me I have to download Quicken 2004 and convert from MS Money, then to Q2007."
5,Great update,I have been using quicken for years and normally update every 2-3 years. This upgrade is a wonderful experience. They have added so many useful solutions. Every year I try the free download of money but it has some nice features but just does not allow the flexablilty of quicken.
1,Quicken is unable to verify the financial institution information,"If you get the above error message you have been ""quickened"". Quicken, always a company that is on the cutting edge of profit strategies, has hit a new low. Imagine if you car stopped working the day the warranty ran out. This is Quicken's new software strategy. They don't just stop supporting the product, they pull the plug on your ability to download information from banks. This had made my working computer program worthless to me. What if this works? How would you like to buy every piece of software you use every couple of years? If you buy 2007, you support this new strategy. I hope it falls on its face."
2,Just try to get support!,"If you did not buy Quicken 7 online, but from an office supply store as I did, it seems impossible to get any answers for questions. Last month I did reach a telephone helper, but Mr. Singh Pal was of no sensible help at all.Now I have gotten a $10 fee from my bank for using quicken, and I cannot reach anyone to find out 'WHY?' It is not mentioned anywhere in the help, nor in the sales pitch.Caveat Emptor!(if you DID purchase from Amazon, you are in better luck, because they ask you for your online order number)k.hazelhoff"
2,Disappointing,"I have been using Quicken for over 15 years. The first time I had serious problems with it (mostly response was bad) was in 2003/2004. When I got 2005, I decided to keep as long as I can. In 2007, I got the new one and am very disappointed. It has many problems and is very unstable. I cannot validate my datafile, and quicken intermittently displays blank screen and hangs at startup. I finally figured out that there is some bad interaction with Norton Conf. and un-installed it.Overall, I am not happy with Quicken and am seriously considering switching to MS Money for the first time in 15 years."
1,Intuit forcing customers to bad choices,"From the Intuit Support Web site: ""To continue using QIF, you must continue to use an older version of Quicken (2004 or earlier). However, Intuit no longer supports these versions. Intuit strongly recommends that you upgrade to a current Quicken version.""From an email letter from Intuit: ""As of April 30, 2007, Online Services and live technical support for Quicken 2004 will no longer be available. To maintain uninterrupted service, upgrade to Quicken 2007.""So, if you want the features that you use, you must use the older version. However, as of April, Intuit will discontinue functionality of other features in the hopes that they can force you to pay them more money to get a product with less functionality. Rotten business practices and low-class approach to software development. Note that none of the ""new"" features of Quicken 2007 are enticing enough to get users to upgrade without the bullying tactics.Buy Microsoft Money instead."
1,There's A Reason This Upgrade Is Forced . . . .,"Quicken has adopted a ""discontinuation policy,"" under which its users will be FORCED to upgrade their software to the latest version of Quicken at least every three years. After having been FORCED to purchase Quicken 2007, I see why. This version is not an improvement over prior verions -- in fact, it's slower and more cluttered. Someone should commence a class-action lawsuit for all of us who bought the product expecting it to continue working (i.e., to continue being able to download bank data, credit card data, etc. into Quicken) and who were subsequently surprised to learn that its fundamental features would be cut-off after a mere 3 years."
4,Almost a winner,"Haunting and disturbing. Not for those who dislike strong language and graphic descriptions of sex activities. I loked the book for the wonderful portrayal of place. The writer catches speech rhythms perfectly--including prolific use of four letter words, commonly used in those parts. The author describes Robbie's descent into insanity while maintaining the readers sympathy for him almost to the end, at the same time rousing pity for his victims. However the book fails at the end --it stops as if the author had got up from his desk one day and never returned. Something else was needed to round off the story without leaving the reader hanging. Reads like a promising first novel by a writer who will go far."
1,A lesson in how to be offended,"I would first like to say that I'm not one who is easily offended. Icurse like a sailor and am tired of PC. I try to give everything its fair shake and try not to make snap judgements about things, especially literature, until I have all the facts. That being said, this book ended up thrown against my wall when I finished it. I felt violated, not only by the disgusting and horrible actions by the characters in the book, but by the book in general. I was generally unimpressed by the writing, the characters had little to no redeeming qualities. You can see this in the detailed descriptions of various sex acts, most of which are extraneous to the already muddled plot. What about that Bunker Man? How incidental was he? There is the question of whether or not he exists and is just a part of Rob's psyche. I don't know, and frankly I don't give a damn. If I could give this a 1/2 star or a negative star, I would."
3,A hard book to finish,"This was a hard book. It's well-written technically, and the Scottish dialect gives it a certain charm. The first third, at least, was pretty enjoyable. But the subject, this apparently well-adjusted man's descent into madness and jealous brutality, makes it hard to recommend. I tend to try and encourage my wife to read books I've finished and enjoyed, but not this one.One thing that bothers me about the book is that there's no investigation as to what causes Robbie to descend into this madness: apparently he hasn't always been this way, or at least no one else has noticed it, but he sinks deeper and deeper into this ghastly, inexorable schizophrenia. It sort of has the feel of a play in that regard, something from Tennesee Williams or Ibsen.As an aside, I saw the author at a reading shortly after the book came out, and he certainly didn't seem like the sort of person who would have crafted a book so bleak and brutal."
1,A Waste of Paper,"Painful to read (mentally, physically, and Psychologically), Bunker Man is one of those novels you keep reading in hopes it will get better only to have your hopes battered mercilessly. Rob's disregard for everyone, the students he is supposed to protect, and even for his own wife makes him a very unsympathetic character. You almost wish he would be institutionalized if not killed by Bunker Man, as the novel's cover sets you up for. Despite being the title character, Bunker Man is barely present in the novel. This is one of the most offensive novels I've ever read. It overflows with crudity that sinks the weak almost non exsistant plot. It seems at many times that MacLean doesn't care about any of his characters which I find lacks discernment. I fail to see how anyone could praise this fault ladden novel, yet alone publish it. If you could rate this book for what it deserves, I would rate it a black hole."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This was the most appaling piece of literature that I've ever read. Rob, the main character, is never presented as remotely likeable or sympathetic due to the terrible and unremorseful ways in which he acts. Ultimately, Rob hurts every other character in this book (especially the females) both physically and mentally. The worst part for me was that never once does the prose stop to consider the consequences of his actions on the rest of the characters. I realize that creating such a mentally ill character such as Rob so craftily may be viewed as a real literary feat on the author's part. On the other hand, I don't feel as if the plot and the repercussions of the character's actions were dealt with responsibly by McLean. It was a struggle to get through the entirity of this novel due to Mr. McLean's sadistic and misogynist imagination. I felt as if it all went from bad to worse. I would also give Bunker Man the negative star rating if it was an option."
1,Save your hard-earned dollars for more worthwhile works.,"If you read for ""entertainment"", Bunker Man will leave you with a feeling of resentment at having blown the purchase price on a less-than satisfactory exercise in writing. Mr. McLean seems to have such a low command of his language that he cannot compose a paragraph without lacing it with profanity. His novel is sick in content and does little more than cheapen us as a society. Only purchase this book if you have a fascination with the behavior of perverts. My copy now resides in the trashbin. I am most surprised that National Public Radio chose to promote such a collection of garbage. I was expecting a crisp, mystery-thriller and got a Scottish lad's exercise in just being filthy."
2,"More ""Filth"".","This the second Scottish novel I've read in the last year that was all about a self-important, self-involved, hell-bound character who fails to see himself as the world sees him. The major difference between this book and ""Filth"" is that ""Filth"" is a bit more amusing and a bit less boring."
3,Second rate Turandot,"I'm afraid my review of this dvd is not terrible favorable. Zhang Yimou did a beautiful job in terms of sheer stage spectacle. The singers, however, are basically second string and definitely not singer/actors, especially in terms of overly stylized gestures, Calaf's wandering eyes, the fluttery movement of Ping, Pang, Pong, etc. Where are the days of Callas, Tebaldi, Nillson, Bjoerling, etc. Perhaps it was the dvd I saw, but voices seemed out of synch with mouth movements. Grand opera can be beautiful, but I don't know that film is the best medium. When the camera gets so close you can see every double chin quiver, well...."
5,Out-freaking-standing!,"This was AWESOME! Granted after seeing the freak show the Met put on with James Levine Conducting I was ""easy to please."" However, I think I overcame my bias, objectively rated the piece and logically concluded that it was SUPER AMAZING!! lol Get this and have fun!"
3,A waste of scenarios...,"When you perform Turandot at Beijing you have to take advantage of everything you have. This performance looks more like a concert... The choir and the actors are always standing in the same place, as if it were a puppet performance... The voices are not as good as anybody can think. Just an average performance in a really wasted location..."
5,an ultimate in overall production,"There is no more spectacular recording of any opera ever made, to my knowledge. The Chinese government got behind it to make it a visual masterpiece, and musical personages from throughout the world flew in to see it. While the vocal artists may have been surpassed by various of the historic greats, the overall production is an unequalled artistic masterpiece.Carl H. Berggren"
2,Eurpean DVDs May Not Play in the US,"The DVD arrived in good shape, but it won't play in our region. They offered to take it back, but what a pain. Beware of ordering DVDs from Europe."
3,ALDO BOTTION,"I am not an opera ""buff"" but I bought this DVD soley for the purpose of seeing someone I know in the opera..his name is Aldo Bottion and he played Altoum but, not knowing opera, I don't know which character this is..I hope it's not the old man with all that makeup, cause I couldn't even pick out my own mother with all that makeup...Could anyone tell me which one was Aldo Bottion?"
1,The quality of this video is horrible beyond belief!,"I saw this performance in Bejing, and this video in no way reflects what I saw. Some scenes are out of focus, there are no long shots which give a sense of space and place. The direction is totally haphazard, with no continuity of shots. It is so horrible to watch, that I was distracted to the point where I could hardly listen. The cast is ok, but totally undistinguished. If you love or don't know Turandot, this video is to be avoided at all costs."
3,Inconsistant,Robert can realy play. As the other reviewer stated when he plays fast and fun this CD is great. However the CD also has to many slow country numbers that maybe country fans can appreciate but I skip through. You can clearly hear his idle Danny Gatton's influence in his playing. I would love to hear an all instrumental tele album from him. He is also an outstanding acoustic flat picker and I think that is what he is doing these days.
1,Unreliable,"This drive is very unreliable. Backing up (copying) small number of files works ok; however when trying to copy large number of files, Windows 2000 starts to report I/O errors. When this happens the drive light stays on continuously and the drive does not respond any longer.I will send it back and try to come up with some other back-up mechanism.SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Buslink USB drives are NOT compatable with Mac OS X,"Please do not buy this device if you want to run it under Mac OS X - although it will work under Mac OS 8/9, support for OS X is ""not planned"" according to their service representatives."
3,BusLink Customer Service,"I have found BusLink Customer Service to be responsive, sometimes arrogant and not particularly helpful."
5,Great for MP3's,"Just recieved the Buslink external 40GB hard drive in the mail last week. Only took five minutes to install and has been a snap to use. I have over 5,000 MP3's stored on it and use it as a digital archive of my entire music collection, vinyl and CDs alike. Works well with Windows 98 2nd edition. With 40 Gigs of space you can fit an enormous emount of music on it. If used as a storage device this product does the job, I would not, however use it as a platform to run programs off of. Overall I am very happy with this product."
3,Great for back-ups,The extra storage works great for backing up large amounts of data. Can be easily moved to different computers for transferring files or creating and restoring back-ups. Drive is plug and play so it is easy to set up. Sometimes Windows 98 willhang up or freeze during long periods of USB Drive inactivity but this seems to be a Windows problem not Buslink.
3,Sort of impressed,"I'm not into industrial music, but this is good music (notice I didn't say vocals). I've been heavily exposed to other agressive groups such as Korn and Nine Inch Nails and more (thanks to my loving partner), but Skinny Puppy's music pushes some buttons, atleast with this cd."
5,Brilliant! Absolutely the best Puppy.,"Without a doubt, Too Dark Park was the best Skinny Puppy project. While their other album's, both before and after, paved the way for other experimental/industrial acts and in themselves, created new genres, this album was definately the most inventive and inspiring."
1,"Bad illustrations, no story line","Just don't understand why Dr.Seuss's books are so popular! The illustrations are pathetic (all animals look more or less similar, it is hard to distinguish them), there is hardly any story line, just a sequence of non-sensical rhyming words.I would stick with P.D. Eastman or Alison Jay any time"
2,Ouch,"The more Dr. Seuss books I read, the more I wonder why people love his books so much. The original books are WAY to long (buy the board books!) and remind me of the study that shows that kids these days have a shorter attention span than in the past--15-30 seconds, the length of time of a commercial on TV. Maybe it's not the commercials that did it, but rather Dr. Seuss. After about the third page, this book switches from fish to other creatures. This really confused me. From the title, I expected the whole book to be about fish, and opposites, or at least different descriptors. But not only is it not just fish, after the third page, the whole thing falls apart. Each page has nothing to do with the following page. Why were these pages put together to form one book? Who knows. To the reviewer who says he can read it in any order--this isn't Choose Your Own Adventure. It's _supposed_ to be a sequential book."
4,AWESOME BOOK,"This book is one of my favorite children books. This book is a real easy book to read for a young child. This book tells about the colors of fish, counting fish, adjectives of fish, what they wear. It also goes on about how many feet some animals have and it describes how fast or slow they go. Then later on it tells about how many fingers he has on his hand. Towards the end it tells about people and kids having weird pets who all serve some useful purpose or other towards the owner of the animal. This is a fun book to read and it does serve some purpose or another towards educating your child in simple but needed words for life and its adventures. This should not be very expensive and your child will read this book over and over for years to come, I know I did."
1,defective product,"This book was mis printed - the bottom was cut off and appeared at the top of each page. I found out too late to return or refund for the total price, but would like to do so.by Dr. Seuss Theodor Seuss Geisel One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (I Can Read It All by Myself) 1988 reprint edition"
5,A proven classic,"Even though he can't sit through the whole thing, my toddler repeatedly pulls this book for bedtime. According to him, he ""likes that."" What else is there to say?"
3,Five stars for the book. Three stars for this edition.,"The book's content will always be wonderful, but this reprint--the physical book (1988)--is a disappointment. It's smaller than the edition I grew up with; smaller than the ones my kids had.The picture shown is deceiving This edition has a big red jagged permanent thing just under the ""blue fish"" of the title, nearly as long as the title words ""red fish"" and as wide as the space between ""red fish"" and ""blue fish"". In the red splotch it says, in white, ""Look inside if you wish for a FREE gift!"" Boo! Yuck!"
5,Timeless classic,"Don't skip this one, please. You just have to have these tongue-twister books to read to your child. It's a blast to read fast too. My little one keeps saying, ""faster, faster mommy!"" Good thing I can speed read! It's a fabulous book and one that every child should own. It inspires tons of imagination and fun and really makes reading exciting for little ones. It's weird to run into someone as an adult who hasn't read these classic Seuss books. It makes you feel sorry for them and wonder what other great things of childhood they've missed."
5,Child Pleaser,My oldest daughter had this book memorized before she entered pre-school. She would go around Grandma's house (or tell anyone who would listen) the entire story. The rhyming is fun and the pictures are great. The short sentences make it easy for little ones with a short attention span. I would definitely recommend this book for story time!!
3,"No logic, but it's fun","One of my first-grade students pointed out the truth to me: this story does not stay ""on the trail"", so to speak, of keeping with a connected story. (Ironically, this fit very well with a lesson). And yet there is something incredibly fun about the random creatures trotting themselves out in all their quirky Suessian glory. So no, there is no logical plot, but we get fun pictures and dazzling rhymes that we love."
4,One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish,"This was a really good book. I really enjoyed it when I was a little kid.This book has so much color and I also like how it all ryhmes. It teaches that everyone one is unique in their own, special way. I think this is for a 4-6 year old child."
3,Good beginners book.,This is a good book for the youngsters. Good Suess style story although I have liked some of his other books better.
4,"Good book, my son loves it","My son really likes listening to this, the last few days we've read it a lot. Though frankly, this isn't one my favorite Dr. Seuss books. It's not bad, but it's just not as fun for me to read out loud as some of the other, that's all."
4,A Good Easy Reader Choice,"A rhythmic, rhyming book of real and imaginary creatures, illustrated in Seuss's delightfully engaging style. It is composed of short, funny scenes that are strung together to form a certain coherency as the creatures named become sillier and sillier. After nine or ten read-alouds it starts to feel a bit long for adults, but the short scenes make it a good fit both for rambunctious toddlers with short attention spans, and early readers who will benefit from the achievement of finishing each scene. It also comes in an audio version."
5,One fish two fish red fish blue fish,"One fish two fish red fish blue fish, By Dr. SeussI liked this book when I was younger. This book let me know that all the fish in the sea were not the same. In this book it discribes all kinds of fish. All the different color, and sizes of fish. Like baby fish big fish old fish new fish. This book helped me to understand that all the fish in the water were not the same that there were hundreds of different kinds of fish. Also that all fishes don't get along with each other, but some do."
3,Good Book,"My son loves this book and it arrived quickly. However, although it was marked as being in good condition it has writing on the pages, a child's name written on the cover, very worn, and pages are creased."
5,Lots of fun for your daughter or son!,"1 fish2 fishred fishblue fish...this book is great for anold fishor anew fish!This classic Dr. Seuss book is a collection of silly rhymes that will make adults smile and children giggle. Bizarrely-wonderful characters like yops hop, yinks drink pink ink, yings sing and wumps bump! Come and ring the gak out back, box a gox and open some cans with a zans!As always, with Dr. Seuss's books, children learn to read by rhyme and repetition. Your child will ask you to read this book to her over and over and soon she'll be reading along with you. Learning through fun is Dr. Seuss's specialty.If you've never read this book you should.This book is fun...and fun is good!"
4,"One Fish, Two Fish","ISBN 0394800133 - Not my favorite Dr. Seuss, if only because it's a little long.A Dr. Seuss that's long is wrong -My child falls asleep too fast!Too many pages, he can't last.Yeah, Dr. Seuss is always a favorite, but this one was one my kid always fell asleep during. He didn't hear the end of the book for years! As a storytime title, rather than a NAPtime choice, though, it's a great book for little ones. You might get tongue-tied reading it, but that's okay, too - you'll laugh together, reading will be fun and everything will work out perfectly!- AnnaLovesBooks"
5,One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish,My children grew up with this book. We would snuggle up and read it nearly every night. This copy was purchased for my Granddaughter and I am snuggling once again reading this little book. She loves it too...as do I.
4,"Dr. Seuss's ""One FIsh Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish""","This book is a fun book for young children all the way to teens. A book filled with tongue twisting rhymes starting out with just ""One Fish"". Many pages filled with great elaborate mad up animals to fit the amazing rhymes. I give this book four stars because it is so fun to read."
4,"""One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish""",This book is good for people of all age's. IT has been around for many years bringing joy to all families . It can be read on all levels. The First level is childern. Most kids see this as a fun filed book with funny pictuers and tounge twister's. The second level is adults. If a adult were to pick it appart the would say it was talking about differnt culters and ethnicity's and how we should all be treated equal. So This is a good book because people of all age's enjoy it.
5,One Fish Two Fish is almost magical,"This is my favorite book by one of my favorite authors. The characters are all excellent, from Ned who does not like his little bed to Ish who wishes for fish on his ""Ish wish dish."" The stories are short, usually one page each, and are all fun in one way or another.I recently bought a copy for myself and since the first time I read ""One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish"" about 10 years ago, to today, the simple phrases and pictures still amaze me. I have never found an author of children's books that can compare to the imaginative drawings and stories of Dr. Seuss (Not even Theo Lesig which is weird because that is just another pen name for Mr. Gesel) This book is a must have for every home-kids or not."
4,Great book for kids,"I read all the Dr. Suess books to my four month old baby boy. He loves them. They are great books for children. However, this particular book is a little long for him."
1,Flimsy quality,Extremely flimsy quality..kids will shred this quickly..not worth the money..very dissapointed..get the hardbound copy. This is a classic that should last for years and the paper back issue is not worthy of the story.
3,Good for beginners...,"This book covers the basics and is a great book for beginners, but if you are looking for something with a lot of meat and new and in depth information, it may not be the book for you. If youare already into this sort of subject matter, this will seem elementary and very basic 101 stuff. It is good, but very basic. Some of the things written in this book also seem to miss the point. But, I will let you decide. Personally, I felt a little let down by this book as it just didn't give very much deeper information."
3,bye-bye dee-dee...,"this album contains some great songs. the awsome cover of paladaice park, n pet cemetary, but dee-dee is going which leaves a bad aftertaste, becuase he is a great song writer n bass player but overall this is a great albumcr."
2,GOODBYE DEE DEE...,"Brain Drain was the last album to feature Dee Dee Ramone as a member of the band. The band's inner turmoil is evident in what is their second-to-worst album (their prior album, Halfway To Sanity, is the worst). Fortunately, there is still some good songs, including ""I Believe In Miracles,"" ""Punishment Fits The Crime,"" ""Pet Sematary,"" and ""Mery Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)."" The album also contains one of the Ramones' best cover songs, ""Palisades Park."" While the Ramones never recorded a terrible record, Brain Drain is not among their best."
2,FORGET ABOUT IT,"If you are a real Ramones fan, you know what I'm talking about: this is one of their worst albuns. Simple as that."
4,New Direction for the Ramones,"This was a terrific album by the Ramones that featured one of their best songs ever ('Pet Semetary') and several other very good songs (the heavy 'I Believe in Miracles', the comical 'Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)', and an excellent cover of 'Palisades Park'. The remaining tracks are all decent (Even Joey's latest attempt at a Spector-esque ballad 'Come Back Baby' -- is top-notch). This was Dee-Dee's last album as bass player. Surprisingly, the change marked a vast improvement over the previous album (the dreadful 'Halfway To Sanity') and the subsequent hiring of C-Jay kept the band interesting through much of the 90s."
5,ROCK BRAIN,"BRAIN DRAIN is a good collection of punk songs from the RAMONES. It's not one of the best albuns from the RAMONES but got the hits PET SEMATARY and I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, and great tunes like ALL SCREWED UP, ZERO ZERO UFO and LEARN TO LISTEN."
4,Thunderous -- last album with Dee Dee,"Certainly this is not one of the classic Ramones albums, but it has alot going for it just the same;Bill Laswell produced it and layered the guitars giving it a dense roar.If like me you are a fan of Marky's drumming you've never heard him hammer it home more so than on this one.It features later day classic ""Pet Semetary"".It was the last album with Dee Dee playing bass (he did continue to write for them after leaving the band).Besides, in my humble opinion, there are no bad Ramones albums."
2,Ramones could do better...,"I have been a Ramones fan ever since I could remember and I thought they could never do anything wrong, album wise. Was I wrong!""Brain Drain"" is probably the worst album the Ramones have put out. Only five of the tracks out of the twelve, are worth listening to.("" I Believe in Miracles"", ""Punishment Fits The Crime"", ""Palisades Park"", ""Pet Sematary"" and ""Merry Christmas (I don't wanna fight tonight)"" )DO NOT get this as a introduction to the Ramones music. You will be severely disappointed."
1,Ugh! Another Bad One!,The only reason this gets a star is for the 3 singles off this cd. The rest Who Cares?
3,I believe in a better world for me and you,"This album marked the return of Marky Ramone to the Ramones. It also was Dee Dee Ramone's last album with the group. And their last studio album for Sire Records. The album is pretty good, overall. It can't measure up to their earlier albums, but how could it? There are good songs here, but only two true Ramones ""classics"" (""I Believe in Miracles"" and ""Pet Sematary""). Although the Christmas song is a near classic. Ramones fans should enjoy this album."
3,"Nice mats, Mis-advertised!","The mats are pretty good. Not the best grade rubber, but for the price, pretty good. THESE ONLY COME WITH 2 FRONT MATS. I would look at a different set if your real picky."
5,A Book Worth Reading,"This book provides an excellent analysis of the problems of very small churches, backed up by statistical information. But it goes beyond analysis into solutions. Solutions are not just programmatic but involve readjustment of vision and self-image. This is a must read for those who lead or are involved in small congregations.John F. PhelpsDirector of haOr Ministries"
4,HIKING THE ANACONDA PINTLER WILDERNESS-,"Being a hiker and nature lover, I found this title one of the best hiking guide books so far. The author convinced me to try the Anaconda Pintler Wilderness, his detailed description of trails in this wilderness is a first. It ties in well with another book, ""The Pintlers, Majestic They Stand"", both of history and mountain adventures in the Anaconda Pintler Wilderness over a century ago."
4,come visit this gorgeous land,"Mr. Arkava's sense of Montana is overwhelming - like he spent all his life here. As a home-dweller in Montana for 43 years, I can tell you that the moon shines loud, the animals sing to you at night, and the sun beats hard in the summer and retreats mightily in the winter.There is also the gaze of the old mountains on young hearts (yes, even though my face is full of wrinkles, I still have a very young heart which beats faster with each word I write) and the majestic views of a still young land from the peak.I admit the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness is even more beautiful than my hometown of Big Timber. I sent this book to three of my four kids to remind them how beautiful this place is (my eldest child, Barbara, still loves her mother and hasn't moved away even though HER three kids have long left)."
2,"Great images, poor value","I went ahead and spent the extra $500 bucks based on the Nikon reputation for a reliable quality product which could be used in the field for years to come. After a little over 6 months of pampered use, the autofocus on this lens just stopped working altogether for no apparent reason. Being the first Nikon product I have owned, I was not impressed. The image quality however was quite nice and very wide at 12mm. I never experienced any vignetting, but lots of flare when pointed anywhere near the sun. I got the auto focus fixed under warranty and ended up trading it in for a little over $500 dollars considered in EX+ condition. So I'm learning. I'm done wasting my money on overpriced equipment. Unless you are independently wealthy or get free gear from Nikon I would get a Tokina or Sigma instead. If anything good comes out of this, it is that I used this lens in trade toward a Mamiya RB67 body and back, which looks like is going to be a lot of fun :) enjoy."
3,Was decent until 10-24mm came out,"Mannnnnnnnn, you should see all the returns on this lens. Don't get my wrong. This is a good len but the 10-24mm is far better investment."
2,Get the Tokina 12-24mm F/4 for half the price,Get the Tokina 12-24mm f/4 for half the price. It's rated sharper than the Nikon and built like a tank! The Nikon lens is plastic.
4,"A little slow and a bit expensive, but absolutely essential","Until I finally ponied up the $1k for this lens, the widest glass I had was my Nikkor 20mm f/2.8. With the 1.5 focal length multiplier that is a fact of life with Nikon SLRs, that's the equivalent of a 35mm lens.I'm old enough to remember when 35mm was considered adequate for a wide angle lens, but no more.The multiplier takes this lens up to 18mm, which is pretty good. Stick it on my F5 and I can practically see behind myself.I shoot a lot of editorial stuff for newspapers and this is an excellent up-close storytelling lens. It's sharp and delivers spectacular scenic results when matched with a polarizing filter.In actual use, my only complaint is that f/4 isn't as fast as I'd like. A minor annoyance and certainly not a deal-breaker.I'm glad I bought it. It's paid for itself many times over."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this lens after much research and procrastination, it was expensive. I used it with my D80 and took several shots at with it over a weekend. The exposures were perfectly exposed,contrasty and saturated but simply NOT SHARP. Maybe it was the particular copy of the lens I got. I was disappointed and returned it. If you think you want this lens, carefully examine the return policy of the company you purchase it from, if it's not from Amazon. Some of the Amazon retail sellers have a restocking fee of 15%. At approximately $900, the restocking fee will cost you a hefty $135 plus shipping if you change your mind."
4,Lens,"I use this lens all the time!!! Love it. Works well with taking pictures of my work. I'm a re-modeler and do lots of bathrooms and kitchens. So in bathrooms mostly, the wide angle is a HUGE plus! Sharp and fast enough for what I use it for. Is also lots of fun in taking all sorts of other pictures including landscapes."
4,Nikon 12-24mm Zoom Lens.,"This is an exceptional wide angle zoom lens. It doesn't offer the ultrawide action of a fish-eye but, once you start using it, it's a great everyday tool. A couple of points: the clip-on shield makes the lens physicallly wide and, even without this, the lens is large enough to impair performance when used with the in-camera flash (casting a shadow on one side of the image) - hence only 4 stars. Altogether obviously expensive, but if you like wide angle images, then the results to date make this a great addition to my D200 kit."
5,Since I couldn't afford the Maserati...,"...I went for this. I know, I know - Nikon gear is really expensive. But I think it's still one of the few things in life where you get what you pay for. As my uncle once told me, ""Kid, if you want the best things in life, you've got to be prepared to get ripped off to get them."" Truer words were never spoken.And why would I plunk down the money on a great D70 and then cheap out on the lenses? Seems a bit silly. If you want to take great photos with a Nikon, why not go all the way (if you can), I say. Would I like to pay a little less (or maybe even a lot less) for this great lens? Of course I would. But this lens is magnificent and delivers the performance I want. It feels good in my hand and greatly expands my creative options. Plus, it's very well made and I expect it will serve me well for many years to come. Perhaps not for everyone, but it's my extravagance for myself and my hobby (since I can't afford the Maserati)."
5,Great optics,One of the best lens for lanscape and confining spaces were you need to get all in. Extremely sharp lens and extreme depth of field.
3,Pricey and not worth it,"This is an excellent lens. Well-built and sharp. HOWEVER, so is the Tokina version at half the price. I tested both and couldn't tell the difference in the images. Used the other $500 for something else."
3,Was I unlucky?,"Maybe I landed on a dud but mine had trouble focusing on one side, so I took to Nikon and they repaired it and told me they added a ring inside (!!!). It still isn't that sharp especially on the sides. This is rather disappointing given the money I spend on it.It feels quite lightweight and plasticky.On the positive side it is very low on flare."
1,Don't waste your money,"It is unfortunte that I couldn't rate it lower than a one. I had to buy this for a class. It is poorly written and organized and along with the standard test that comes with this course, the whole thing is a tortured exercise in semantics. Plus, For starters on pg 54 there are ""WBS Definitions"" and finally on page 58 one is told that WBS means Work Breakdown Structure. It would appear that this author's native language is not English and unfortunately, I haven't yet made sense out of the babble."
3,good thriller,"This was a great beach read, which is just where I read most of it. The story moves with great pace but is pretty improbable. I liked the assortment of characters. Not literature, but a fun thriller."
1,oh pleeze!,"This is the most shallow, one dimensional, tedious, skimmable book I have the SHAME to admit I read. Boring! The idea is not original. It mimics aspects of the NUMA and Dirk Pitt series and feebly attempts Tom Clancey technology dicourses. It is fanciful to have a dashing type pirate descendant doing the ""derring do"" stuff,the plot is too predicatable and the characters so cliche. The reviewers listed on the book jacket include Clive Cussler and Nelson DeMille who I guess must be drinking buddies of Mr. Bell because they certainly didn't help him with his fiction writing! I wonder how the author was fortunate enough to get it published in hardback. And did the publisher assign an editor??? My copy of this book will end up added to the give away pile."
4,This book is just plain fun.,"There isn't anything ground breaking here, it's just a positively fun book to read. A lot of action, intrigue, bond-esque kind of book that just entertains, which is preciously what it's supposed to do.This isn't my genre, so I'm not about to compare it to whoever the percieved ""masters"" are, it was just 500 pages of fun reading. I know that's redundant, but I can't think of any other way to say it; I liked it."
1,time line challenged,"I had problems with this book early on, I slogged on...page 77..Mrs. Purvis is shot, her heart is nicked---coma----page 173-TWO days later she is home and doing needlepoint...page 178 I quit--I coulnd't finish the book---"
1,Do not buy it,"This is a real bad version of a Tom Clancy technothriller. The characters are cartoon like, continuity editing is missing and is continuously harping about the evil French. The premise could be interesting, but it is written for an extremely simple minded audience."
2,A Big Letdown,"Compared to Ted Bells other books, this was a big letdown. I hope his next book is better."
1,So predictable a complete waste of time,Save your money. Anyone that picks the book up will know what happens. We all have seen the characters and story line before. I find it hard to believe that the book was published and that the series is still around.Bell would have had a better series if he took the rich hero and have him battle financial crime. I just found it disgusting that the author would want anyone to believe that this guy is the only guy that can save America and the world. What a cruel joke.
1,Not ready for prime time,"I heard Rush Limbaugh rave about Ted Bell's new thriller Tsar, and decided to get it. Thought I would get some interesting background about Alexander Hawke by first reading Pirate. Getting Pirate was first my Ted Bell mistake. It is so Slooooooooooooow and at 600 pages that's not good. I have personal rule that if I start I book, I finish it. That rule rule and this book are killing me. I hope the decision to buy Tsar was not also a mistake."
3,I wanted to like it....,"I really wanted to like this book. Looking for a fun, summer, beach read--I picked this one up. It started off pretty well. Very interesting plot line, a couple of interesting characters...but then it fell flat for me. I ended up dropping it about 3/4 of the way through. Too many cliches, characters that were caricatures and a lack of understanding by the author of the military, CIA, etc. Not terrible, but not that great either."
2,Hardy Boys gone fowl (sic).,"This is the second Ted Bell book I've read. The first was ""Hawke."" Perhaps I should have cut my losses. Bell's writing and research have improved but ""Pirate"" is still burdened with hollow characters and jarring implausibilities. In providing fast-paced action and a lively plot, Bell has sacrificed all else.Bell's target audience would seem to be 18-year-old military enlistees with time on their hands. As for myself, I cannot suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a Bell novel."
2,Shallow and Pale,"This book is a book written as a ""formula"" book. It has several outright inaccuracies as has been previously cited. Hawke was given the first F35 to buzz around in? Riiiightt! Come on that plane wouldn't have been allowed to be photographed much less flown by a rouge guy like Hawke. What was the point of the F35 Flight in any case?An anti gravity train? Is this Science Fiction?Another case was when Jet was about to be set upon by a frothing at the mouth Doberman, Jet says release the dog. It turns out the dog was a long lost pet of hers named Blondi. Riigghtt! A pet does not show fangs and froth at the mouth.I believe several parts of this book were just stuck in for filler.To often someone shows up miraculously just at the right time to save the day.There is a great lack of creditability in this writing."
1,My first,"I have never written a review of any kind. This book was so bad I felt it necessary to warn off others who may be foolish enough to spend money on it.I read about 1300 pages per week so I know quality work when I read it.Absolutely horrible and unbelievable. If this were the last book on Earth, I would burn it for fuel."
4,Fast paced once you figure out who everyone is...,"Highly recommend this book!This is the first Ted Bell book that I've read and about 1/4 of the way in I was completely hooked. I couldn't put it down, listened to it through the night. I have the audio version (great for commutes, laundry and woodworking) and the narrator is excellent. The story moves fast and is told from the viewpoint of multiple characters -- this is what slowed me down in the beginning, figuring out who all the characters were and what their role was.If you like your novels action packed with characters that you really care about, some humor and a good ending, then this is the novel for you."
2,Needs to be tightened up,"This was the first book by Ted Bell that I have read - I selected it based upon the reviews and Amazon recommendation based upon other books I have bought. While the storyline was really good, the writing was not - there are too many attempts at ""clever banter"" along with details that contribute nothing to the plot. Additionally, some areas of the story are passed through very quickly while others go into long, unnecessary detail - I ended up jumping through several sections of pages without missing anything. I also did not care for the abrupt ending - I actually thought my Kindle download was missing pages. Based upon the writing style - and not the plot - I would not recommend this book which is too bad because this could have been a really good book!"
4,Good Adventure,Ted Bell extends his tale just a little too long. But it is good adventure for the arm chair tough guy. Ted Bell wants us to enjoy the ride...in this he is successful.
5,Great Book,Ted writes a fine thriller dealing in some of todays most compelling topics. I read all of his books and will continue to. If you like Tom Clancy and the other writers in this genre you'll love Ted's books!
2,It is what it is and I was amused...,"This is the third Alex Hawke Book I've read and my feeling for it, is the same as for the other two. There's potential there but it rarely lives up to the hype. I was amazed that Hawke let himself get so stupid over Jet in this novel. And I really couldn't understand why Jet would all of a sudden be in love with Hawke and willing to betray everything for him. There was no real development of that story. It felt like there were too many side plots in this novel - Ambrose falling in love? That was hooky. Hawke almost dying in that new plane? Really what was the point of that. I keep reading his books in hope of him finally getting it ALL right. So far it hasn't happened. So I'll probably wait until the next Hawke book hits my library instead of wasting money on it here."
2,It's a bit of a Potboiler,"If you enjoy a fast-paced adventure story and you're not critical about details, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this book.Bell has created a decent yarn with fairly interesting characters. Too bad he and his rewrite editors were so careless.Unfortunately, Pirate contains entirely gratuitous sequences, unexplained holes in the storyline and factual inaccuracies, making the overall effect a little comic-bookish."
1,Awful,"I rarely stop reading a book before the end, no matter how bad, but this one makes that short list. I like the spy/thriller genre, and I like the premise of France and China collaborating to counter the United States. But I can't stand it when an author doesn't even take the time to check his facts. If he had reviewed his manuscript with any number of 14 year old military buffs, he could have gotten some easy improvements. Not to nitpick, but Lear Jets can't land on aircraft carriers. The Navy doesn't fly CIA agents and their rich British friends around on prototype fighter planes. Harpoon missiles can't be launched from yachts. Etc, etc. None of these things is really central to the plot, so why didn't Ted Bell do just a little extra work to get things right? Laziness."
1,Not Impressed,"This is my first experience with a Ted Bell novel, and will be my last. I find the writing to be too heavily cliched, and the storyline somewhat unbelievable. I'm struggling to finish the book, in the hope that I'll be rewarded eventually, but things aren't looking good."
3,belt stinks after use,"The material of the belt soak up sweat from wearing. It stinks after using and needs constant cleaning. Otherwise, the watch is very functional and stylish looking."
2,Not worth the money,"I was expecting a much ""thinner"" crystal which makes the wine drinking better by 10 fold. Come to find out, Riedel has 3 lines, this is the bottom of the 3. On the good side, it's more sturdy than hand blown crystal. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a glass of this caliber, buy a Libby. The [high] price is not justified."
5,The Best Wine Glass,"This wine glass is great for several reasons. First of all, it is very light. Second, you know how much wine to pour (pour to the widest point in the bowl and that is a ""glass"" of wine). The balance of the glass is good. We also have the burgundy wine glass; however my wife prefers her red wine in the chardonnay glass because she doesn't like to hold the big burgundy glass. If you are only going to purchase one type of wine glass, I would recommend this one."
5,Beautiful glasses,"I am not an oenophile and actually prefer the sweet wines. However, these glasses have helped me appeciate the dryer whites better. The tastes seems to be more complex and I no longer focus on the dryness of the wine.The glasses themselves are beautiful. They look very delicate but have thus far survived multiple dinners and hand-washings. I received many compliments on them.These glasses have helped this novice appreciate a wider range of white wines. They are expensive and I feel my heart race whenever anyone brushes too close to them. But they are worth the money."
2,Old habits never die,I found this device to be much harder to get used to than originally thought. The trackball was in an odd position which I did not find at all comfortable. I have fairly large hands and still found it difficult to use the buttons which were also very difficult to get used to. Most of all I missed having my scroll wheel in the middle. I have over the years become very accustomed to that feature and did not like the way this device works around this button. It was however sensitive with its tracking and felt comfortable except when I had to use it. It was also fairly easy to setup although WIN XP gave me a little trouble at first recognizing the drivers the device came with. Also the price I found was a bit high after using it which between the comfort and price along with my middle scroll wheel button earned its rating.
4,Excellent for the price,"I purchased this to teach Italian to my 7 year old as part of our homeschooling this year. I do not speak Italian, so I needed something basic. This set has been just what I wanted- something simple and low key. Each lesson has a CD portion to listen to, and an activity to do to reinforce what we've learned. I do wish that the lessons built on each other more, to reinforce vocabulary from the previous lesson- but its very easy to add that in myself with this program. You won't learn to speak fluent Italian from this program, but its a great introduction for the price."
4,The marriage of Middle Eastern and Flamenco gypsy music,It is wonderful that Ishtar has 'married' the Middle Eastern sound with the Flamenco ... finally the 'gypsy' music is coming out from behind its 'veil of the centuries'
5,Hard to find treasure,"This is a fantastic album that can be difficult to find. If you love the Gypsy Kings and Albina, you will love this album. Enjoy!"
2,Pales in comparison to their first CD,"I was excited to buy Alabina's second CD; as among my collection, their first CD ranks among the top 3. Uncomparable music and integration of Arabic rhythms and Spanish Salsa. The second album hardly matches up to their original quality. In fact, they ripped two tracks off the original one. I don't recommend this CD much. Now the first one is something else... it is out of this world! The best of the best."
5,A lovely blend of Gypsy and Arabic music.,"This album is flawless and done in extremely good taste. The selections in Spanish are comparable to the Gypsy Kings and the Arabic part is done very beautifully.In every case, Alabina sings the Arabic parts.The Spanish part has her male counterparts singing along. There's a deep soulful quality to Alabina's voice that makes listening to this album a sure delight."
1,Unable to review due to craptastic nature of Sony/Ericsson 905a,"I bought this thinking that the cord on my existing power adaptor had developed a flex-break after two years of service.Unfortunately, it seems I was wrong. It's the craptastic design of the interface on the Sony/Ericsson that's at fault.And so, I'm unable to write a review of this product for it's intended purpose.However, as a review of a means of determining yet another way that the Sony/Ericsson 905A is a truly horrible phone, it worked well.At least it was cheap."
1,sony errikson phone charger,"product worked for about a week then not anymore, sometimes intermittent. Had to order one from the sony co. direct."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Your Romance Published,"Terrific! When I first read this book I'd just finished the first draft of my first novel, and while I was pleasantly surprised at parts of my work, whole sections of it were just plain sucky. I had no idea why some things worked and others didn't. I started by reading Chapter 14, Polish Until It Shines, and found the advice on using your strengths to fix your problems especially helpful. After being mesmerized by this chapter, I went back to page 1 and read the whole book. Golden nuggets were everywhere!"
4,David Bowie collaborator steps out with solid effort,"Gabrels has been a, well... controversial David Bowie collaborator, but I for one would gladly pick a fistfight with any one of his detractors. ""Firedome"", written by applying the piston firing sequence of a Firedome's 8 cylinder engine to a major scale (7 degrees, plus 8 = octave), is all he will ever need to secure his place among the greats of rock's avante-garde. The remake of the Bowie/Gabrels penned ""You've Been Around"" (with actor Gary Oldman [!] on vocals for the second verse), and the slow, noisy cover of ""Bad Moon Rising"" are definite highlights. A few of the Gabrels-written songs are weak lyrically (""119 Years Ago""), but all in all this is a fine album. 3.5 stars (I'll round up, I guess...)."
5,Reeves at his best,"If you are tired of the usual guitar playing, with all its already extremely used ways, but don't want to give up listening rock'n'roll, you really should get this album. Not only a guitar player, but also a songwriter growing after each work, he can give you rock at the best level, and at the same time showing something new, that will not sound strange to your years. That's a difficult task you have to admit. And if you think that this is all, you should get his last online album "" Ulysses (della notte)"" even better than this."
1,terrible,this was the worst music that sounded like david bowie. i can't believe these guys have even gotten a record deal....oh the humanity
3,bad acting,I enjoyed the movie when it first came out in the 80's. I recently bought the DVD and realized its a good story- just bad acting. This is one film that needs a remake. Has the potential for a 5 star.
4,"Dated, but surprisingly suspenseful","Any movie that features Whitesnake video vixen Tawny Kitaen is bound to raise a few eyebrows, but for this 80's horror romp, well, let's just say that acting isn't the most important thing here. Kitaen plays a woman who comes into contact with the spirit of a deceased young boy via a Ouija board, and eventually, releases something much more sinister from the board that begins to assume posession over her. Relying more on suspense and mystery than blood and gore (something that was a change of pace for horror films of the 80's), Witchboard is a surprisingly satisfying horror romp. However, the look of the film is so unbelieveably dated (gotta love the mullet) that some may have a hard time getting into it, but other than that, Witchboard is still a fun flick. The DVD is another fine package assembled by the good folks at Anchor Bay, who sure know how to package a horror film right."
2,B grade movie,"Cheap and cheerful that's about all one can say about this movie, it has a good story line but unfortunately is lost in poor performance"
3,Formula time passer,"Jack and Jill play spooky with an Ouija Board (that looks creepier as time slowly passes due to the director constantly exchanging boards to see if we notice.) Naturally, they conjure up the wrong spirit. The spirit is a Jason want-a-be. We have the dumb cop that figures it out too late.Of course, no one stays in the car. You just have to axe-cept this film for what it is.A side note is that the DVD has a commentary (10 years later) and the making of; that is if you finished the movie and are still interested.Burn Witch Burn"
4,One of my favorite movies,I can't wait until Witchboard is released on DVD! This movie is a definite cult classic and actually a pretty decent movie. The only way to find this movie now is on VHS and all copies I have seen are pretty worn out. If you ever used a Ouija board or had any interest...see this movie. I will definitely add this to my collection when it comes out.
4,"What's all this ""cheesy 80's horror"" name calling??","Cheesy 80's horror?? hummmm??? what's good 90's horror?? Scream? I know what you did last summer, Jeepers Creepers!!! blah, blah, blah!! Some of the best horror flicks to ever come out were between the late 60's and late 80's. Sorry guys, the rest of the stuff you have now just doesn't make the ""cut"" and/or is ripped off from ""80's cheeze"". I wish you were born in that ""cheezy era"" because eventually the 90's and even 2010's (10""s) will be cheezy. At least we and our films had an identity and didn't have to be ok'ed by Ludicrous, P diddy, or 50 Cent...what a sad joke. Sorry........."
3,A scary classic!,I watched this movie back in the 80's as a teenager and LOVED watching it again as a now adult.Great classic movie!
4,GOTTA LUV THE 80'S!!!!,"this flick is 100% for the children of the 80's!!!!! i luv this flick! though its not even close to the genius horror that KEVIN TENNEY brought us with ""NIGHT OF THE DEMONS"" it still is a good fun filled horror flick from the 80's!!!! horror fanz don't be afraid to spend $$$$$ on this flick!others may want to rent before buying!!! later on fellow horror fanz!!! E!!!N!!!J!!!O!!!Y!!!"
3,Another 80's cheese movie...,"I thought I would like this movie, but it really sucked in a way. It would be very cool if they did I remake that would be a lot more scarier!"
3,Cheesy 80's horror at it's best!,"I first watched this movie at a slumber party in the late 80's. I had forgotten all about it until some recently mentioned it, and I remember how much it scared me as a little girl. I tried to rent it, but no luck. I just bought a used VHS tape on amazon.com, probably for less than the rental would have cost. This movie has great 80's style, and a creepy soundtrack. Tawny Kitean was striking in this movie, which almost made up for the horrible acting. There are ton's of cheesy one liners, and some of the murder scenes are pretty grusome. The ending sucks, but the rest of the movie almost made up for it. If you like 80's horror, and can rent or buy this cheap, why not give it a try?"
4,Campy But I Like It Anyway,I first saw this movie on cable years ago. It's about a couple who move into a house where an evil spirit resides.The spirit is dormant until the female resident starts fooling around with a Ouija board.
3,Not up to Douglas Reeman,I was looking foreward to reading this book as I have read most of Douglas Reemans books and was looking for new books on navel warfare. Compared to Douglas Reemans books this was very slow on the action parts and characters. I found myself skipping pages to speed up the action. Operational descriptions were very good but make dull reading. I was going to purchase the book Submarine by the same writer but decided against it and ordered a Reeman book that I had read a number of years ago. I would rather read a good book a number of times than a poor one once. If you are not familiar with Douglas Reeman or a book titled HMS Trigger by Anton Melville-Ross get them. I am sure you will not be disappointed.
5,"Smart, witty television from Paul Gross (again)","Having Paul Gross write, produce and star in any production should be like having a licence to print money. I hope the reason he has not gone completely ""Hollywood"" is by choice and not lack of opportunities.This film is a riviting piece of work. Relevant politcial intrigues and amazing charters dominate this film. The ending is unexpected but completely logical given current realities and the clues in the film. Best three hours I have spent in months."
5,Every American should see this film.,"A companion work, along with the sequel, ""The Trojan Horse,"" this film, the first of two profound and sobering indictments of modern politics, ambition, greed and Machiavellian mindsets, sadly too familiar in America. Paul Gross is superb. Entertaining, engrossing and surprising to the very last frame--these two films bring the future of America and American politics under the microscope."
2,Disappointing purchase,"Item was purchased through Amazon from an outside provider (Kylakins). When watched, two thirds of the way through the movie the disc would not play any further. Discovered the disc was defective. I can return to Amazon for a refund, but not directly to the provider for a new copy. In order to reorder this movie, I would not be able to get it for the same price I had purchased in October(approx.. $23.00) but would now have to buy it for $39.99. I definitely do not want to pay this amount for any movie but would like to see how the movie ends. I will have to reconsider ordering items from Amazon, through a second party source in the future. I am very disappointed."
4,"""a conspiracy of international proportions threatens the existence of Canada itself""",Yes . . . it's called the United States!
5,Great Mystery,A great read. I could`nt put it down. I only hope their are many more HARRY BLACK NOVELS COMING.
2,Original or fake?,"A previous reviewer has described this as ""quite simly the greatest concept album of all time""...and I agree. Unfortunately this is not that album it is simply a compilation of some of the tracks off the original album. Imagine my disappointment to discover Stanley Unwin's opening lines ""Are you all sitting comftebole two square on your botties?"" wiped from the album's opening ....given that this was a concept album this seems to me to be the ultimate in arrogance...as is placing an extra track (which is extremely mediocre) in the middle of the album. The original narrative weaves the songs together to provide a complete work of art so I don't think this album should be sold under the title of the original. This kind of artistic vandalism is akin to overpainting the Monalisa's smile!"
5,Ogden's Nut Done Good!,"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake produced in 1967 is quite simply the best concept album of all time. Harder, meatier and grittier than Sergeant Pepper's, it was also more coherent with a subtle yet definitive storyline (involving the moon and a boy). All songs are well composed over several levels of musical sophistication, making the experience of listening to the album deeply satisfying. The inclusion of Stanley Unwin in the production of the album was a feat of musical genius. Stan brings to it a more meaningful and believable psychodelic element than most other concept albums have. With its mix of melodic rock tunes with their long 'jamming session' endings, ballards and psychodelic interludes Ogden's can be listened to over and over again in pure enjoyment."
5,"A sound, no-nonsense approach to healthy eating and living","This book has the ring of truth to it, unlike many books on nutrition I've read. Dr. Airola lists most common diseases (and even includes a chapter on smoking), and gives step-by-step instructions on how to deal with those maladies, including dietary suggestions, herbal and other supplemental recommendations, as well as other techniques such as juice fasting. (I have followed Dr. Airola's protocol for fasting several times and have found it a cleansing and healing experience.) Several appendices are very helpful, including dissertations on how to fast properly and what constitutes a healthy diet. The writing style is engaging, even entertaining. I consider this book an essential part of the home library. It is a shame it doesn't have a wider readership in the United States."
2,Not impressed,"I wish what this man says would really cure all the ailments he states despite the fact that there are some good suggestions that if one followed, would feel healthier. He mentions these clinics in Sweeden, and let's face it, are we really going to be able to afford them let alone if they still exist from the time this book was written. A friend swears by this man so I am going to give this book to him as he gave his copy away."
2,Poor packaging,"Both Amazon and Riedel did a poor job in packaging these glasses, so two sets arrived with broken stems. Riedel merely wrapped the glasses in paper and stuffed them in a sauvignon blanc box. Amazon placed this poorly packed box into another box without adequate padding. They did this twice. Amazon declined to send a second replacement so I never had the pleasure of testing them out. I love my other Riedel stemware bought at brick-and-mortar stores."
5,Classiques de la comédie,Ces deux films sont des classiques de la comédie franaise. Le Dner de Cons et le Placard sont les meilleurs films de Véber depuis Pierre Richard et Gérard Depardieu. Jacques Villeret est excellent en Franois Pignon et Auteil lui succède bien.

5,This is a classic - you must own it!!,Stop using this from the library... Just buy it and get it over with!!Ansel's fantastic images and stories combine with his technical discussions to provide the perfect insight into how to become the necessary craftsman. His uncompromising approach into printmaking and photography are clear and simple examples that any novice should at least start with. There are other books out there - but no better start than this. Enjoyable and instructive at the same time!
5,the print,Things become clear by reading in a book how to use it! This is such a book to accompaign the normal photolessons on school-level
5,A classic for every photographer,"When I was a teenager Mr. Adams was kind enough to be a penpal with me, a novice. He, his works and books will always be a welcome addition to my library."
5,use of dr clean dvd/cd cleaner/renewer,"the unit does an excellent job in what it was designed to do.the only complaint is finding the liquid cleaner replacement compounds for separate sale.you must buy the whole kit for [some price].so far the only source is the ""gadget alert"" catalog.yes,virginia,this product REALLY works,we have saved 2 dvds so far!!the liquid contents are good for only a couple of uses--PLEASE manufacture+distribute a ""giant size"" bottle refill kit of cleaner and polisher items."
5,Pink Floyd -- Umma Gumma & Wish You Were Here,"They may not be the best band ever, but they are the band that most speaks to me now, that most perfectly captures our time. NIN bores me by now. And all of reznor's progeny seem to be mining the same territory. Godspeed is the new King of Depression, the best to come along since Joy Division. The closest music they can be compared to is the live CD from Pink Floyd's Umma Gumma. Next, I'd have to say Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here and then Animals. No one else is making music like this. Maybe Sonic Youth with Bad Moon Rising and Daydream Nation. Godspeed's reputation is well-earned. I saw their recent sold out show and there were lines around the block of people who couldnt get into the gig. Just the biggest band in the underground right now. Both their cd's are great. Take your pick."
4,All 4 Stars are for Moya!,"I love Moya. It's very beautiful and emotional. BBF3, on the other hand, is kind of off. The guy talking made such an absolute fool of himself that I was almost certain that the song was a satire on anti-american people.My solution? Put the record on the turntable moya-side up (this is a vinyl-only release, by the way), play it, and then never flip it over."
5,the last in my collection - amazing as the others,"only two tracks - only a half hour of material they wrote during one of their concert tours. this is fine by me. infinity symbol lats a little long - a little over 60 minutes i get through two tracks and need a little break....that was what was nice w/ lift your skinny fists...which isn't available on amazon anymore....it was 2 disks composed of 40min on each disk..anyway - this album combinds the debut w/ their latest release...the first was very quiet and their last one was more loud this fits in the middle - easier to approach than the otehr two. the same feelsing of dispair are incorperated...along w/ the liner notes a excert from teh bible explaining loss of the earth and being mislead by god. makes you feel all warm inside doens't it? well, thats gybe for you. enjoy this i wish i had gotten it first in some ways its the best one."
5,Recommended listening for ages 3 and up!,"A frighteningly brilliant EP hard on the heels of an equally stunning full-length, Slow Riot etc. devotes a little more attention to the stirring martial passages and fist-pounding themes that punctuated the aforementioned earlier release. A difficult band to review since they're sui generis -- I honestly can't think of any other band that's doing anything close. A high-volume listening session usually leaves me feeling like my soul has been sand-blasted. At the same time, this band's work gives me a ready response to jaded cynics who claim that no one is producing music with any craft or imagination, since GSYBE! has both in spades. This music is an antidote to a cretinized American pop culture that has given us Pauly Shore and Celine Dion (and yes, I know GSYBE! are Canadian -- maybe they know something in Montreal that we don't...). Try a little Slow Riot at your next cocktail party!"
4,"""Virus"" by Maiden!","The music on this ep is pretty good, but the most amusing part is the vocal sample of the madman on track 2. He recites word for word, the lyrics to ""Virus"", by Iron Maiden! Godspeed must have known this, because Blaise Bayley was the current singer of Maiden at the time. Most people who would listen to this, probably would not ever listen to Iron Maiden, or vice versa. The music is good to be sure, but the vocal sample is worth the price of admission. For any curious godspeed fans, the song ""virus"" is available on the Iron Maiden comp. ""Best of the Beast"""
2,Who cares?,"I am very disappointed by this record. It is incredibly boring! It is a lot like Mogwai, but doesn't engage your attention. The dynamics are blah. The dialogue in the background seems to have been carelessly added. Check out Mogwai's ""Come on die young"" or ""Young Team"" instead."
2,"I'm Sorry, But No","I'm sorry, but no. This music combines the pretentious attitude of Keith Jarrett with the musical inventiveness of The Backstreet Boys. You see, on this album the chords and melodies take a back-seat to volume fluctuation. Their music is extremely boring, and not because of my inability to listen to lengthy pieces of music, but for their inability to make those lengthy pieces of music interesting. Bands such as this think that they can create emotion and elevate bland, simple music to the level of greatness by adding distortion or lots of volume. They can't."
5,riot indeed,"GYBE!'s half hour EP offers more in that slim time period than most current rock bands do in a career. the first track by the canadian collective, Moya, follows the usual pattern of a GYBE! song, using swirling strings and subdued percussion to engulf the listener, building both the momentum and intensity as instruments join in and the tempo quickens to one of GYBE!'s best musical climaxes. Blaise Bailey Finnegan III uses samples from the paranoid conspiracy theorist heard on the last album, yet instead of merely creating an interesting introduction for the song, it acts a bizarre kind of lyric. his disturbing poem rambles on top of a vaguely menacing rhythm, which explodes soon after Finnegan finishes talking into what seems to be an orchestral expression of his internal chaos or perhaps his view of the future.a really fabulous ep"
4,Ehhhh...,"Okay, i bought this product w/out reading the reviews. I recieved the item and was pissed off at first because it was not detecting my ipod. I went through the help at apple in order to enable the disk on my computer options and when I did it still did not recongnize my ipod. I was about to destroy the software but i read online that there is an update thats free that syncs the ipod with the newer version of itunes because the software deals with the older version like 4.1 or something. The website to download the patch is simple and all you do is click next and agree to terms and concepts. I will give you the site to make it easier...http://www.valusoftsupport.com/KBArticle.asp?kbid=5740i hope this helps you all because i know the reviews before me were negative so i am actually the first to write a positive. But its cheap and easy to use program."
2,Tune Transfer,"Product shipped would not even install on an Intel Mac Pro. I wrote the company and after exchaning several email, they agreeded there was a problem and send me a newer disk that was upgraded to work with the Intel Mac Pro's."
1,Total Waste!,"I wish I had done more research and read more reviews before buying. I'm sure it works if you can get it to recognize your iPod, turns out there seems to be a general problem with this program NOT recognizing iPods (ummmm...isn't that the main point?) Don't waste your money.At least I'll save my money on Tune Tools, which apparently is ValueSoft's next attempt to steal your money.Tune Tools for iPod (Win/Mac)"
2,Riven wannabe that falls short.....,"I was hoping this game was going to be more exciting like Riven but it fell short.First of all, the music is almost non existent which hurts the game and when it is cued, it's not that good.Second, the puzzles, while some of them are good, the rest are very tedious work of going back and forth moving parts which takes a long time and gets very boring.Third, you keep waiting for something to happen in this game that never does.Some of the puzzles are very hard, but I like that....There are parts in the story that make no sense.It's tries so hard to be like riven that sometimes during the game, I wondered how they didn't get sued by Ubisoft by the blatant rip-offs in scenery and machinery and storyline.If you like Riven, Myst games, give it a whirl, just don't expect much..."
1,"Stupid puzzles, more annoying than challenging.","I play lots of adventure games. I'm smarter than your average bear. The puzzles were just stupid.Here is an example. You look in a window, and an old lamp is flickering. You are supposed to count the flickers, they are a code. A code to what? Another, totally unrelated puzzle far away. How do you know this? You cheat and use a walkthrough.The puzzles are so random. When you read the solution, you don't go ""ah ha!"" you go ""What the heck?"". With every adventure game, you sometimes have to go to a walkthrough to get unstuck. This game requires walkthrough help all the way through.Too bad, the graphics were kind of cool, the idea had potential, it's just the puzzles that failed this game."
3,Fun but awfully complicated,"I never actually finished this game. It was fun to begin with but it seemed like there was no logic to a lot of the puzzles. Or, maybe I should say, there was logic, but you had to know the end of the story before you realized what you were looking for.If you are a brain or play this kind of game constantly, you will probably do fine. I'm an intelligent human being, but I don't play a lot of these games and don't really care if I get through them, so it was a little more complicated than what I like. Probably, it depends more on your gaming style."
4,guitar? island? Who would of guessed?,For me this game has been difficult. Difficulty feels so good when you solve the game. Really like this one. It has a little bit of everything in it. Guess who-guess what and how.
3,yamaha rx-v461,"I was a Yamaha Fan for many years until I bought the RX-V461,sound quality is good,all round quality is good, one thing is lacking in this unit, YOU definately need the Manual, especially on the remote,It Took me 1 hr to set 5 FM stations, the remote needs some serious re-design"
1,NOT acting!,So the performances in given in this move are complete shit. After observing the lowest bar of talent and plot I will have to give this a negative 18 stars below 0 just for pure crap. If you want to loose brain cells and cry yourself to sleep for nights on end you will make the dive into purchasing this atrocity. F'ing stupid.
1,Poor quality,The lights are very faint and glow for about two hours after sunset. Half of the lights are on for less than an hour. I am returning my lamps.
1,No good,I really don't like these lights. My biggest complaint is that they are hard to mount and they don't stay put.
4,Great singing from New Orleans,"This vocal group from the ""Big Easy"" is quite unique and have a great sound a la the Boswell Sisters. Their rendition of ""What Are They Doing in Heaven Today"" ,an old gospel song, is worth the price of the recording. If you can't get to New Orleans right now, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed."
5,!!! EXCELLENT POWER METAL FROM BRAZIL !!!,EXCELLENT ALBUM - GREAT VOICE AND SPEED FROM BRAZIL !!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL !!!
2,meh...,"A pretty standard collection of songs...my first ""Back To Mine"" and I didn't realize they weren't mixed. You can get all the songs on here elsewhere, and the ""EXCLUSIVE!"" Prodigy track is pretty middling. I like his flow track-to-track, but the selection is ho-hum. Highlights are QOTSA and Meat Beat Manifesto, that 'I Chase the Devil' track if you ever wanted to know where the ""Out of Space"" sample came from. Otherwise, don't bother! Rather expensive for a single disc of unmixed tracks you can find on iTunes or other P2P sites for signifacantly cheaper."
1,Not for my kids,"We love the earth, and what it provides for us, but we aren't into evolution. I actually threw the book out. I didn't appreciate the whole ""Mother Earth"" feel of this book. Should have done more research and saved my five dollars."
3,Rap & Hip Hop?! I disagree.,"This is a decent electronic album with, yes, a prominent bassline. I didn't get the feel of rap or hip hop from it because, bassically, I don't like either genre and I liked this disc. The samples are consistently clever and often amusing, making for a varied listen in whatever style it is. Uh...that's...um...word? A'ite!"
5,"Do they, do they not?","Now this takes me back. A great test for your system, though most of todays surround systems cant even be turned up with these tracks! Ha. I wish I could get a hold of the DJ Bass Boy prequil to this album. Get it and enjoy!"
2,meh,"I got the CD I wanted and it worked, but it was scratched and the original case was all messed up. If I wanted my expectations to be disappointed I could have bought this from the bearded kid at the local music shop. Damn good bass cd, but I wasn't wow'd with the delivery or price."
5,It's a certainty that this CD kicks A**,"This album is raw, catchy, fast, furious, more raw than the album after ""Extreme Aggression"" Mille's bark on this one is frightning, and rules, theres not much to say about this one, every song is a keeper, not one bad tune, 36 minutes of pure mayhem, buy it!"
1,P.U.,This is a terrible CD.....PU. I heard one tune on Last.FM and thought the tune was pretty so the band has to be good too so I ordered. Well I could not have been so wrong. Can't find anything good to say so I'll shut up.
2,Careless mistakes frustrate the reader!,"This book might give you good practice on high school entrance exams, but the careless mistakes make it frustrating to get through even one subtest! They don't even know their alphabet! This is the first book I have seen which has a language test with the options (A), (B), (D), and (D)! It is an outrage to know how poorly this book has been put together. In the long run, it will teach your child to learn a thing or two about entrance exams, but please, if you have other books to choose from, choose another one!"
4,Interesting Book,"The books contains a few interesting passages, along with the common banalities that I hear all the time from anyone who knows what's what in Tai Chi.Still, the stories are nice. It's refreshing to find a book where someone doesn't show you a (poor) form with 2 basic applications and claim to the the God of Tai Chi.If you really want something to sink your teeth into, hit the tai chi classics.PS- The best laugh in the pages of the book are the pics of Yang Chen Fu in ""action"". For a master, he had sloppy form."
5,My 4 yr old loves this!!!!,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She is not that into barbie, but she loves animals. On her birthday she played with this for about 4 hours. She is still playing with it. My son is 6 years old and he was playing with it too. He wants one for his birthday. :)It is definitely worth buying!!!"
5,Budding Veterinarian,"My granddaughter, age 5, is totally enthralled by the pet shop. She can play for hours, rearranging the shop, caring for ""sick"" animals and helping her customers. It's a wonderful toy. The pet food can get messy, but she just cleans up and it's a good learning situation for her. I highly recommend this shop."
3,Not So Fun at Current Price,"We bought this toy for our daughters 5th birthday because she loves pets and the idea looked fun. First, when opening, in addition to all the ties there are also lots of clear rubber bands. So don't let your kids pull things out until you have undone all the holds.The water from the aquarium is ""emptied"" when you use the hose for ""washing"" the pets. The button on the nozzle is hard to press and hold and very slow release of water. Water won't pour everywhere but hard for smaller hands to do this. Also, if you want to empty the fish tank fast this isn't the way.The hamster runs in the hamster wheel (as you manually turn the wheel) and can ""move"" by moving a plastic knob. So far the only way we found the ""pets"" to make noise is by opening the food bin, which is a little cumbersome for the younger ones.I'm glad I got this at a great sale price, if I had paid the full price I would be disappointed."
3,gee wiz,It's cute and all for a barbie lover but theres not that many pets -a couple of rabbits a dog a cat a hamsterand a bird wowthats a lot -NOTYeah Ijust dont see anyone buying this unless their on a barbie spree the 'toy' itself is kind of bulky and i had a hard time trying to find a good place to put itI don't see me buying anything like this in my future unless I go on a barbie spree dought I will though after this product
3,"Kids love it, parents hate it.","First of all I am ready to disown my friend who gave my 4 year old this toy for her birthday. The small pieces that come with this toy is ridiculous. Seriously, why would they put all those little pet food pellets in a child's toy? Had I known that it had those pellets I would have thrown them away before my daughter saw them. Of course scooping the pet food in and out is her favorite part of the toy. Ugh. It is cute and she loves it but it's really a mess with all of the tiny pieces. Mattel really needs to consider parents also when it comes to designing a toy. The only reason that I am giving this toy a decent raing is because my child likes it. If you are okay with a constant mess then buy it."
3,"Better than nothing, but missing info","I've had several VW's starting in 1987 and a Bentley manual for all of them. This latest edition seems to have sacrificed detail for sake of being able to cover a myriad of engine types/models. Notably missing is any information on the power window mechanism, not even a diagram. Also vague is information about the removal/installation of distributor cap and rotor. There is a lot of ""installation is the reverse of removal"" (This makes sense in a purely logical world, but not in the real world). Finally, I notice a total lack of the wonderful symptom/solution troubleshooting tables that have appeared in previous versions. It's better than nothing, but doesn't seem up to the regular standards of detail!"
1,Not Enough Detail,"This book doesn't have sufficient disassembly instructions.It shows exploded views of engine components, but not enough of how to get in and actually service them. Because there are so many models covered, the lack of detail is stunning.Buy this book only if you want to look up the parts you just spent $$$$ at the dealership having replaced. Don't expect to be able to service your own car with this."
3,Hooked and then dropped,I got hooked onto this great story line only to find out that there is no sequal and a lot of loose ends. If you absolutly have to watch it borrow it!
2,"Soap Opera Quality, Low Production values","After watching Downton Abbey, I was looking for another period piece from the UK. This one disappoints.The premise is a good one, and the first few episodes fine--although production quality is not very good. (somewhat grainy and washed out)As the series progresses, the travails become increasingly melodramatic and unreal. One particular story line involving a baby goes beyond stretching your imagination....On the positive side, it is good to see English society....although the ""upstairs"" folks are routinely portrayed as weak, without morals and in some cases, extremely cruel.Overall, I give it a 2 for the beginning episodes that showed young girls coming to London as Nannys. As it progresses, it becomes a soap opera in all senses of the word--overly dramatic with constantly escalating situations, characterizations that are black and white and almost comic, and resolutions that are too pat. By the end, I was glad it was over."
2,WHAT!!!,"I loved the drama but BEWARE..how disapointing...WHAT.. is with the ending,I went threw my DVD thinking I had missed the other DVD!!!Checked with Amazon to see how many came in the set. It was just unfinished.. You really don't find out what happened to the women."
3,A Sentimental Soap Opera,"I bought this DVD set because I love historical costume dramas. However, although the costumes and settings are lavish, the content is barely endurable. At least, to someone who dislikes gobs of exaggerated sentiment and lots of cute little kids. If you like that sort of thing, fine. If not, be warned."
4,Just my kind of movie!,"I enjoy these types of movies. Seeing women from all kinds of backgrounds trying to make a living in a time when most positions that earn real money are occupied by men. I did not realize that there was such high esteem and prestige in being a nanny. They had a lot of responsibility in caring for the children. Some parts were sad and I wish that all could have been well for every character in the movie.I randomly picked this movie as I had not heard or seen it before, and I was very pleased. I shared it with my sisters and they too enjoyed watching it. It is money well spent!"
2,That's All Folks,"Thanks for the reviews, I'm glad some of you enjoyed it. Sorry to tell you though there will be no more ""Berkeley Square"" as, sadly, the BBC decided not to continue production. You'll have to let your imaginations fill in the blanks left over."
5,A Gem,"I bought this series based upon the very positive reviews here on Amazon, and even so, the series totally surpassed my expectations. The characters are richly drawn, highly individual, and very endearing. You truly feel as if have met them-and are glad you did-by the end of the series. What's more, the plot is terrific--carefully foreshadowed and conceivable yet unpredictable. I found myself unable to imagine a resolution and yet knowing such a well-crafted story would resolve convincingly--as indeed it did. The series kept me utterly engaged and attached to the outcome quite literally to the last minute. The only drawback--no sequel!"
5,An addicting series,"This series far exceeded my expectations, and once I started to watch the series I could not stop untill I had watched it in its entirety. I wanted more and more, why are there not any more to this wonderful series?"
4,Why did it stop???????!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this dvd sight unseen after reading so many great reviews and I am not sorry that I did. It is a wonderful mini-series! I enjoyed the story and the characters. All very catchy. What I don't understand is why it stopped! I want to know more! Is Matty pregnant???? What of Lydia and Hannah? And Jack, does he get a girl? I enjoyed it so much that I sat there for the whole 8 1/2 hours (excluding the 5 minute breaks here and there) to watch the entire series! I couldn't stop. I wanted to know more and now I am stuck still wanting to know more.This is a very good movie with likeable and attractive characters, good story lines and believable events! I highly encourage anyone who likes perdiod mini-series films to watch this one. It is more like a t.v. mini-series than a movie type of mini-series though so be prepared to take it slow throughout and want more at the end!"
3,WHERE'S THE LAST DISK?,"This is a great series with superb acting. HOWEVER, it ends in a way that will leave viewers unsatisfied. There is no resolution to any of the several storylines. You can only speculate as to how all is resolved. I had to check the box to see if I had overlooked the last disk.Berkeley Square"
4,A Good But Not Great English Drama,"English produced drama is one of my passions and this is a good representation of the genre. I enjoyed watching it the first time, but find that when I look over my collection to find something to watch once more, I pass it by. The acting is good, but the story is just a bit too unbelievable, a bit too pat. But if you love English drama, give it at least one look. You won't be sorry even if you, like I, feel it could have been even better."
3,I was left hanging!,"I am in the minority group - I think it us terrible that this English soap opera was developed and only 10 parts were made. I invested hours in watching great acting, great costumes and excellent scenery only to side-swipped and robbed by the abrupt ending! As much as I enjoyed the 10 acts, I just feel like I would have been better off not watching it because of how it ended. Save your time and find something that will not keep you guessing!"
4,Please make more episodes!,"I encountered this series through my public library and got to the end of tape five and could not believe that was the END of the series! There is too much left to tell - we're left with Mattie's love Ned going off to war, Hannah's friend being hanged for a crime she didn't commit, the former nanny, Simmons, finding out that Hannah has substituted her child for the baby at her house, Mattie's employer's wife carrying her lover's child without her husband's knowledge (and perhaps going to try to pass it off as her own) etc. When will the public who loved this series ever find out what happened with this and other BIG glaring hanging details? They NEED to make a sequel - this series is great, but there is one scene in the series which children should be warned against watching - not graphic, but still adult material."
1,Lack of recording quality.,"I am so disappointed in the lack of quality regarding the DVD. It is so unclear and ""grainy"" that it detracts from watching the movie. Amazon graciously and quickly exchanged the DVD, but the 2nd one was just as bad. I have returned that one also. It is always disappointing to not have ""CC"" also.I would have truly enjoyed watching this movie and hope they can restore it soon."
3,Could have been...,Better. It didn't meet my expectations. I think it was the way it was played out. It almost got a little bit monotonous. Wives and Daughters was way more to my liking and style.
3,Enjoyable,I enjoyed the story line but wish the producers would come out with a season two. There is just too much left hanging in the air at the end of the series.
4,Berkeley Square,"Love these 1800-early 1900's stories. Great fan of the classics, Jane Austen,Bronte' sisters,most of Dickens, etc. books, made into films. What a mess these girls have, especially the mother. Hated the ending tho, but I didn't write it did I?"
5,I want more!,"Please don't tell me it's over! I simply loved this story. The writing and acting were marvelous. I became so engrossed in the characters that even when I wasn't watching the series I was thinking about it. In my view this has to be the best program that I have seen in a long time, and I am sorry it didn't continue. I and my friends wish that BBC would pick it up again. We're fans!!"
3,Not as good as some other series,"This series was a good idea and fairly well written and produced but I like series that I want to watch again. This didn't qualify.My feeling was this was intended to be followed by another, like Upstairs Downstairs, but didn't quite make the grade. It started well but lost momentum.Worth watching once."
4,nice story,"I got reeled into this story, but then I like stories set in this era. Is there a second season?"
4,"It really deserves 5 stars, but had trouble with characters","Really enjoyed this video. I sat and watched most of it in one day. It was good that I did because it was a little difficult keeping all of the characters and the nannies separated with the families. Trying to figure out who everyone belonged to was the reason for the four stars. The Edwardian period is one of my favorites, and I am so glad I purchased this video."
4,Berkeley Square - The Complete Series,"I love movies or series based on life in England in the 19th century and this story of 3 nannies in London didn't let me down. Each nanny has their own personal story to tell along with their life in the homes of their employers which gave me a new perspective on life ""in service"". It was interesting to get to know the nannies with their families (or lack of them) outside or their life with their employee families and other servants."
4,Strong Women,This is a very relaxing series to follow. The lives of these 20th century nanniesmake us appreciate our lives today. They are servants and are treated as such buttheir humanity comes through. They are inspirations in our quest to survive the world in which we live.
4,Should have continued,"Like other reviewers, the conclusion left a myriad of loose threads. The story is excellent and the actors are simply sterling. It is really worth the cost of the DVD, but trust me, when it is over, you will want more. Sadly the BBC just ended it. I took off one star for that, but in every other way, it is a five star show."
5,really enjoyed this,"i watched this the 1st week i got it and realy enjoyed it, but still think it might have high priced. i was disappointed that this is the end of the series, it was certainly good enought to continue!"
4,Need a sequel for closure,"So many twists and turns in this I wish there had been a sequel. Really good , but mind you, not much gets resolved."
3,Its no Anne of Green Gables,"While I was impressed with the settings, costumes, acting, and more realistic look at the Victoria era family, I thought the stories were rather disjointed. I thought there were several points of the stories that were undeveloped, just ""appeared"", were skipped over or just plain unbelievable. To compare this show to Anne of Green Gables (as one reviewer did) is laughable. Although I am a huge fan of British movies, I would not watch this one again. There are too many other good movies out there."
2,Disappointing,"As a great lover of BBC period pieces, I came to this one with high hopes, despite its cancellation. However, there was a reason it was cancelled. The scripts are not good. The acting is fine, the sets are great, the overall conception is a good one, and expectations were high. But it is annoying. They needed to hire Davies or someone to come in and save this thing, but they didn't. It is not worth a second viewing, except under extreme boredom, and therefore it is probably not worth buying the DVD (unless you have a crush on someone in the cast)."
1,Berkeley Square DVD,"I paid $26.99 for this DVD. I feel when I pay that much for a DVD, I expect to receive a quality DVD. This was unbelievable. It was so grainy, it was hard toview. The beginning credit looked like something that had been pirated. I am very disappointed. I buy a lot of DVD's (and other items from Amazon) andhave never felt like I had wasted my money like I feel on this one. I did call and the person I spoke with apologized and sent me another one. Imagine howsurprised I was to see that it had no better quality than the first one. It truly looked like someone made copies of the original.Because of the poor quality of the picture, we could only watch it for bits at a time. The story itself was very good and we would love to have seen in inits full ,clear quality."
5,Gripping story line.,"I have been a fan of British series like this for many years and I will have to say that this is an outstanding series. It starts a little slow, but watch out, after the second episode the story line has so many subplots going on you will be on the edge of your seat wondering how it will all turn out. I highly recommend Berkeley Square. You won't be disapointed."
3,A flat square,"I was so excited to see this DVD. Because of the first description on Amazon - that it was as wonderful as Anne of Green Gables - I was very anxious to check it out. I was very disappointed - the two shows are nothing alike. First of all, this is a collection of shows from a series, which unfortunately does not have an end. It is wonderful to watch in many ways - very interesting and lovely. But there were so many things that happened suddenly, and without much explanation. I got the impression that the series continued, even when filming stopped!! Many times I found myself wondering ""When did that happen?"" or ""What the heck is going on here?"". All in all, I would say it is a nice thing to watch, but there is no way I would buy it again - it is rather expensive, and it never really ""ends""."
4,"Actually, 4 and 1/2 stars......","Berkeley Square was definitely a joy to watch. I found it interesting to see how all the members of the house lived..not just the rich. I loved watching all of the girls grow together..my only complaint about his movie was its ending..I would have liked more closure, but other than that,this was definitely worth the money."
3,"Soapy, soapy, Victorian soap opera","This miniseries, comprised of ten 1-hour episodes, takes place in Victorian England during 1902. Three nannies from different backgrounds meet and help each other through adventures and travails in London's upper-crust Berkeley Square.While the costumes and setting were interesting, the plot line was pure soap opera. The various characters' moral decisions and plot lines by no means accurately reflect the end of the Victorian era. The series starts out somewhat slowly, but completely jumps the shark in the implausible sixth episode ""When the Bough Breaks"".If no new Masterpiece Theatre series will be airing for awhile, this series could be one to check out, but there are so many other series on DVD & tape that are better. BBC's The Duchess of Duke Street series with the marvelous Gemma Jones is one. BBC's 1976 Pride and Prejudice, A&E;'s Vanity Fair, and Masterpiece Theatre's The Cazalets are others."
5,Delicious!!!,"Like all the New York Style products...this one is delicious! And when they say it's GARLIC....they mean it! Wheww... thank goodness I love the taste of garlic because these are really scrumptiously garlic flavored. These are a thick, slightly hard little chip which makes them great for dips. My whole family just eats them right out of the bag for a snack. What else is there to say? These are GREAT! And low fat with no trans fats. I highly recommend them to anyone who likes garlic!"
4,Good bodysuits,"Made of soft and stretchable cotton fabric. The words are funny, and the size is appropriate (unlike some other less-known brands).Overall the product is pretty good. The fabric is fairly thick so maybe warm for summer time."
2,They shrink and the arm holes are too small,"These were the right size for my baby...until I washed them once. They shrank! Also, the armholes are tight on my baby (He is 6 months, wearing a 12 month size. Mind you he is in the 97th percentile in height and weight, so he is a big baby, but more tall than wide). I no longer want to even use these because they are too small after one washing. They still technically fit, but they are tight and do not look comfortable in the crotch area. One good thing: the hole for the head is nice and wide."
4,CARIBBEAN WEATHER,They can work for hot weather and they are not too thick but they look nice and have cute messages on them. I dont necessarily want to put the one that says big trouble on my daughter because I believe that children become what you label them. OTehr than that the pack is fine.
5,Fasinating intimate account of all the personalities.,"Most appealing for its personal flavor of the events as they unfolded throughout the book. The reader will come away feeling she has shared in all the activities. A must for anyone who enjoys being part of the preparation and inside details of a friend or loved one's wedding. Not only is getting an inside perspective most appealing, but the sensitivity of the author's style makes the reading quite personal as if you, too, are involved in the friendship. Very enjoyable reading that lets you escape from the mundane into a world of glamour."
2,Don't waste your time,"Bought this item expecting a decent product. My fault for not looking at the product more closely. I was expecting the same ""One Love"" fragrance as Auric Blends sells but instead got something else. Smells nice but will not stay burning."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. I ran the dishwasher once and there was still quite a bit of food stuck on my dishes. I ran it a second time just to see if it would help and it didn't. I ended up rewashing the whole load by hand because I simply didn't trust that anything really got clean. I'm one of those that basically washes the dishes before loading the dishwasher and I really hoped that this would elminate that step for me, but unfortunately my search continues..."
4,It works.,"This product works. It cuts through grease and dishes come out clean. The only issue I have is that the powder occasionally gets hard and stuck in the dispenser. I usually re run the cycle after scraping out the stuck detergent. Other than that, its good"
3,ok. Doesn't clean as well as I hoped.,"ok. Doesn't clean as well as I hoped. I thought I could speed things up by not pre-washing dishes, but it didn't work."
2,green pieces in the powder,Has anyone had small green pieces in the box of Cascade dishwasher powder?Would be interested to know if anyone had this problem..The box i bought has a lot of these pieces in it. I did not use it.
5,Barbie Wardrode Carrying Case,I have many Barbie dolls and was looking for a case to store their clothing in. This case is perfect. It is very well made and reminds me of the original ones made years ago.
5,Love It,I aboslutely love this product. I have been using logitech for years. I have a rat and he chewed through the cord on my old one so I got a new one. I think everyone should get this mouse! Its so easy to use especially if you have a laptop. Also the cord is pretty long. Another thing...that ball in picture is gray but in reality it is red.
5,"Seriously, greatest mouse ever","my friend had this mouse for a couple years and i always thought it was so cool. so then when i got a laptop, i knew i had to get this mouse because it worked so well. it takes a little getting used to at first, but then it becomes natural. Great for gaming as well, you can turn faster and spin. must buy!"
3,Took a chance on different mouse,"This mouse is smooth and accurate. The ball to curser movement is dead on! Left and right click buttons are everything you will ever want them to be. It's made for right hand use and it may take a little getting use to.I have limited use of my hands and found that a track ball mouse works best for me. For 9 years I've used a Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse by Logitech. They last me about 3 years each. I thought this time I would try Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical (Silver) by Logitech. May be this one will last longer and I like the scroll wheel. BUT, I'm having a hard time getting use to the track ball offset to the left and I had to put a pad onto the left click button to find it easier. I'm sure in time I'll be use to this on and very happy with it, if it last longer than the one I replaced. The track ball does not fall out if you turn it over! I love that. I recommend it."
4,1st time trackman user,"I bought this product because my one-button Apple mouse died. Overall I'm happy with the Trackman and it works as expected. I've been using it for a few weeks with no major issues. My thumb is still not as precise with moving the cursor around the screen, but I imagine my control will improve with time. One small thing I don't like is that since the two buttons and wheel are relatively close together on a slanted surface, my fingers bump into each other when I use the wheel. On a normal ambidextrous mouse, the fingers are well separated and the wheel is clearly in the middle with plenty of room. I can't really say this is a design flaw, since the surface of the mouse if very ergonomic, but it might take some use getting to. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. It is easier to move the cursor over large distances with the flick of a thumb."
3,Thumb Navigation,"I like the Logitech Trackball mice because my wrist become tired with a traditional mouse. If you suffer with sore and tired wrist make the switch to a trackball mouse. This particular model use your thumb for navigation, something a little ackward for me."
4,Love it - using it now,"I love the optical mouse. It has helped my back tremedously because I am no longer reaching for my mouse to move it around. It took some getting used to but I am so glad I bought it. If you get anything remotely wet or even gummy"" on the ball it acts funny!"
5,Best mouse I have ever used,This is the best mouse I have ever used. I don't know why more people don't use it...so easy on the hands and you are not pushing a traditional mouse all over and into things on your desk.Highly recommended.
1,Not received,"Expected delivery date was 8/13/10. It is now 8/25/10 and the USPS site says out for delivery. Can't get help from either site. Will never use USPS again. I'll give two more days (for two weeks) and request a charge back on my card. Can't find anywhere else on Amazon for help either, so I'll make sure I order from somewhere else as well."
1,Not a good trackball,"On the scale of mens body frames I am in the small category, yet this trackball is still too small for my hand. I need a trackball for my work, and since using this one several weeks ago I have started developing capal tundral symptoms. Also, the picture is deceiving. It shows a silver trackball, but when I got it in the mail it was gray and red (not quite as cool looking). The trackball is way too small to be a comfortable fit for a grown up male. I guess less plastic makes it more cost effective (cheap). Anyway, it needs a complete redesign. The trackball gets stuck sometimes because of dirty build up but there is no way to take the trackball out to clean it. I have an older Logitech trackball which works great and is very ergonomic, but they do not sell that one anymore."
1,waste of money,This mouse is terrible. There are no back and forward buttons for surfing the web. The trackball is extremely annoying. Don't waste your money on this.
3,This is not really an optical mouse,"The mouse works ok if you want a trackball - where you don't move the mouse to move the cursor, but move the thumb ball to navigate the screen. I was specifically in the market for an optical mouse - one that does not use a rollerball on a mouse pad, but uses reflected light under the mouse to navigate. Calling this an optical mouse is misleading - make sure a track-ball is what you want when you buy this."
2,It will not work for small hands,"This mouse is simply too big to work properly for smaller hands.If you are a woman and have small hands, don't wast your money. Don't buy this product"
3,"If You Don't Have Wrist Pain, Don't Buy This","The trackball itself had more resistance than I thought it would when I moved it with my thumb. It was not as smooth as I hoped. I have no wrist pain whatsoever, but I just wanted to try a different type of mouse so I bought this one. Too awkward to get used to and can't imagine it being useful during shoot 'em up computer games. If you aren't dealing with wrist or hand pains and still want a new mouse, I would suggest that you buy a bigger traditional mouse. Any traditional move-it-around-the-desk mouse should fit nicely in your hand. Unfortunately, I haven't found one big enough for my hand, so I have to settle for smaller mice."
3,No more having to move a mouse around on a mouse pad,I still need to get used to the Ball. It moves a little fast for me at times so I guess I need to adjust it. I've had it about a month now and I'm still using it so I guess it will probably stay. I'm sure I will do much better with it in a few months so I plan on keeping it.
3,"Great trackball, worked for 5 years...","The corded version of this trackball is exceptional. Fits my hand (medium glove) exceptionally and a great space saver over a non trackball mouse. The only grievance with this mouse is that after 4 years of daily use, the left mouse click button mechanism became extremely worn. It still clicks but failed to hold click resulting in windows being let go during a drag. Quite annoying. Contacted logitech about replacing just this mechanism but I imagine it isn't the most economical solution. Shame to have to replace such a great mouse for what seems to be such a minor issue."
2,"I agree, earlier model was much better",Wish I had another of the earlier model - this one is a pain to use.My biggest complaint is my middle finger keeps inadvertently pressing the right key.I like moving the ball with my index finger and the earlier model had a smaller ball.
3,Need smaller version,Absolutely nothing to complain aboout. Now have 3 trackballs. Use one for laptop. It would be nice if they made a smaller version for road warriors to take with their laptops. Otherwise beautifully functional product.
2,Poor imitation,"This is a poor imitation of Logitech's original (and high quality) Trackman Marble Wheel. Despite using the same ball and mounting scheme, they decided that they could make this new version without a ring to remove the ball for cleaning. I loved my old Trackman, even though I had to clean it every few days; I keep my hands clean, but I used it an awful lot. Less than a week after I bought two of these new Trackmans--one for home and one for office--I've had to tear them open to clean them to restore the ball action to a smoother out-of-the-box feel. Another problem is that the mouse wheel and right button are badly placed and do not correspond to normal 3 button mouse finger placement like the original did. Finally, a lesser issue of taste is that the mouse wheel roll is too discrete. It's nice that it's not completely smooth and featureless, but there's a little too much resistance/feedback."
4,"Best all around Trackball ever, used to sell for $25, WTF ???","This is the best, most comfortable mouse for regular Desktop & Laptop users, gamers may want something with more featuresI don't know what happened but the last time I bought one of these it was $28 NEW, the price now seems outrageous at over $100for that price you can do better IMHO.I've had 3 of these and they all lasted over 3+ years of heavy duty daily use & still worked OK but the socket gets a bit loose after years of use which is no problem for most normal users.I don't like wireless mice or keyboards, they all have a slight delay & the charging is a pain.Stig. NJ"
5,Best Mouse I've Ever Owned,"Works great on my MAC. Bought a second one for my netbook and now I don't dread trying to use the netbook. If you own a netbook you really need this (although it's big for a netbook). Even makes games on the netbook easier to play. VERY VERY happy with this, and I've owned several mouses (mice?) in the past few years until I found this keeper."
5,The only pointing device I use!,"I've been using a track ball of this design for 13 years now. My original was by Kingston, I believe, but they no longer make them (I still have it... still works, but my cat got at the cable and I'm afraid of breaking what's left!)Now I have 2 logitechs. One for the desktop, and one for the laptop. For anyone that cares, I play games and I do some light spreadsheet work, aside from the normal internet activities. I've never had any problems with accuracy or comfort with this track ball! The only complaint is that it needs to be cleaned a little more frequent than the old fashioned ball type mouse. But since the ball just pops in and out, it's a snap!"
3,My Review,The software that was provided does not work. They inform me that new software has been developed and that should clear this situation up.
5,Never going back to the old mouse!,"The Trackman Wheel did not take very long getting used to, and after owning it for a while I would have to say I would never consider going back to the old way of mouseing.The ball controlled by the thumb is the way to go, the mouse (controller) stays in one place.Logitech offers different versions of these Trackman Wheels, for right handers, lefties, and for those who can use both hands.After you try the Trackman Wheel you'll throw the old mouse away."
5,This is the only mouse I'll use. I'm totally spoiled.,"When a friend gave me his old computer 10 yrs ago, he gave me a Logitech trackball mouse with it. It was my first computer. I'd only used a regular mouse a few times, & had been very frustrated by it, but I quickly adapted to the Logitech ball. I found it so much simpler, more efficent, & faster with less effort.I had to replace the original used trackball mouse about 5 years ago, & the replacement is still working fine. I only got a new one because I got a new PC, & my partner wanted my old ball mouse. He had been using a regular mouse for 20 years, but decided to try mine, & he now loves it. A great product! (just clean the ball with Windex every month or 2, & it'll last forever!)"
3,Nice but....,"Its a nice mouse, but I'm not so sure how much it has helped my carpal tunnel seeing as it did not completely relieve my symptoms. Also its not a very good gaming mouse, seeing as it only has 3 buttons, where as a good gaming mouse usually has more. Over all ,however, it is a very sturdy mouse and feels comfortable in your hand. The rollers under the ball do tend to get dirty however and require cleaning, but cleaning is as simple as wiping off the rollers with your finger.Getting used to using a track ball from a regular mouse isn't very difficult. If your having hand or wrist problems I would recommend giving it a try as your results may vary from mine, especially if your not as heavy of a computer addict as I am."
3,Trackman,My last mouse was a Trackman and it did well by me for many years before it was time to replace it. I knew that nothing else would do. Although I do like this one they have changed the shape a bit and for small hands like mine it's a bit bulky. Overall though I would still have gotten this item.
3,Too Big,"Technically I'm sure this is a fine product. My college professor suggested using a Trackball instead of a mouse for Photoshop work, but after ordering this and trying it out for awhile, I went back to the mouse. This was too clunky and big for my smaller hand and I was very uncomfortable using it."
5,Logitech Trackman Mouse,"I have bought various iterations of this mouse over the last 15-years. If you are not going to use it for gaming, then it is the perfect mouse. Its great if you have cramped desk, and no room for a mouse. Finally, if you are like me and find it difficult to use a mouse for long periods, this mouse really reduces the strain on my right arm and shoulder."
4,good trackball,It worked immediately after the pluggin with my windows 7 64 bit system. It does what it is expected to do.
5,Track Ball,This may be difficult or awkward at first but once mastered you can move faster around the desktop with much less stress on your wrist. No more mouse wrist!!!
5,Love the Trackman,"No need for extra space on the desk, this replacement for a mouse fits the hand perfectly. With your thumb you move the wheel, or spin it for faster cursor movement. Makes pointing a whole lot easier."
2,logitech mouse,"I don't like the way the right button works, when I go to click to click on the left button my fingers click on both buttons (Its a physical reaction) I've had a logitech trackball FX for years and loved it but I will pass on this one hope the grandson likes it."
2,Cheap mouse,I've been using this mouse for a month now and I don't like it.It's very inexact and it feels cheap to the touch.The track ball is kinda bouncing its socket.I also keep pressing the right click button all the time when I want to left click. It's very annoying.
5,Consistent,This product consistently runs smoothly..I love this particular brand and type of trackball...I would highly recommend it to anyone that uses a trackball...
5,Trackball or nothing!,"Logitech simply makes the best trackball on the market currently. I have 4 of them and have never been unhappy.They need to update them and add a couple more buttons, but other than that, this is the best product for the price on the market.Once you go trackball, you will never go back."
5,roller ball mouse,"rollerball mouse, the only way to go. this Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical unit is perfect. The only thing better is the wireless model."
3,Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical,"Works great. Drawbacks after long sessions feel slight disconfort at the wrist, never felt that using MS Trackball"
5,A great mouse all around,"Once I tried a trackball mouse, I was hooked. But the first one I had didn't have a scroll wheel, so I looked for this one. I've been very happy with it. I quickly got used to controlling the trackball with my thumb, and having the scroll makes navigating very easy.It is much more ergonomically correct for my wrist, but you still have to pay attention to the way your hand rests on the mouse, as I've noticed that if I don't, my wrist still gets sore after a long time browsing.Overall, a great product!"
5,Trackman Wheeled trackball Mouse (wired),"I have a Microsoft trackball wheeled mouse of the same design on my other computer, and I love it. I have become spoiled to not having to move the mouse around and re-adjusting it back onto the pad. Logitech has always had great products, and I felt confident in choosing them for my replacement mousing needs. I have not been disappointed! The product arrived on time, and in perfect order."
4,a good product,"I bought this for two reasons:One, I always wanna try what it feels like to use a wheel track.Two, my fingers always feel numb after using a typical mouse for a long time.After using this product for several weeks:One, it feels great!Two, no more pain in my fingers."
2,Not as good as its predecessor,"I purchased this trackball to finally replace my aging Logitech Trackman Marble with a newer one. I have a Trackman Marble+ (with a scroll wheel) at work, and I love it. The one I have at home does not have a scroll wheel, so I thought it was finally time to upgrade.Unfortunately, this next generation of Logitech's ingenious thumb-operated trackball does not live up to the promise of its predecessor. They have made it both taller and narrower, neither of which are positive changes for people with anything but the smallest hands. And in an effort to keep up with the foolish decisions coming from Microsoft, they chose to provide translucent windows around the ball itself, allowing the red laser light to escape and light up the entire room.Overall, I cannot recommend this device. I do however strongly recommend the earlier rendition, if you can find one."
1,Mac Users Beware!,"Mac users: be careful before buying this product! After installing the software on my Mac (OS 10.4), and after spending much time with Logitech tech support, I was told that the software is not compatible with Mac OS 10. The device will perform basic functions only."
2,Do not buy thumb trackballs if you want to avoid rmd!,"If the reason you buy a trackball is for ergonomic reasons (you have sore wrists, repetitive motion disorder, or whatever) DO NOT buy a trackball that is driven by your thumb. BAD IDEA! I did and my thumb started getting sore after about three months of using it. Get the trackball that is driven by your fingers, so you don't have to move your fingers at all."
5,Best mouse available on the market,"We have been using the Trackball mouse by Logitech for a number of years. This particular model is our favorite. I should add that we are a right handed family if this makes any difference. I sell online and must spend hours on the computer and this mouse simplifies so many programs that I use. Ball lifts out easily for cleaning, the scroll button is great especially on sites where I can't use the up and down arrows of the keyboard effectively and your hand and arm do not tire from moving the mouse around as you only move you thumb and fingers. You will never want to use another mouse once you have tried this by Logitech."
2,Great in the past but not this one,Purchased this Trackman in September 2009 after having many logitech products that were wonderful. This trackman came with the marble ball loose in the socket and there are no adjustments. This makes accurate placement of the cursor almost impossible. I have contacted Logitech several times in an attempt to get it replaced or repaired with no response. Wait times on phone calls is always 10 minutes or more. I have sent two emails with no response. Although Logitech has been wonderful in the past I would purchase something else until they get their quality control back to an acceptable level.
4,Best price for this was on amazon!,"I love this mouse for surfing or when I am playing RPGs. Nice change from a regular mouse and a nice break on my wrist as well, but my thumb does get tired after a while. Overall I love it!"
5,Perfect trackball,I use this trackball in a small alcove off our kitchen. This is our main household 'go to'machine for Web searches and scheduling and there was just no space for a mouse. The Logitech is a p[erfect fit size-wise and performs beautifully. Very comfortable.
4,Best Bet,"This Marble Track Ball mouse is a very good device to use if you have limited desktop space. Ease of use in that it is totally functional while stationary. Clean up of the Marble is very easy with less hassle in comparison to older style mice. Second one I've owned, first one lasted for six plus years."
5,easy use,Like this trackman & for the price it is great once you get use to it it will become an old friend at first I was not sure I liked it but now I like it allot
5,I hate MICE,"This product is a safe and animal friendly alternative to having mice infest your desk. By using the trackman you avoid having to maneuver around your workspace, and can leave the pointing utensil in one spot. I love it."
2,"A fall from grace, this used to be the trackball to buy...","I used the original until one day while cleaning it I lost one of the ball bearings. The original was awesome. Sure, it had to be cleaned from time to time but the ball spun easily, the cord was long, and most days it worked so flawlessly you just forgot about it. So since the original would catch without the ballbearing, I decided it was time to get the newer optical version.Ugh.My first one had dyslexia. Up would go down and vice-versa. Logitech was nice enough in sending a replacement but after a few months this one catches almost worse than my original without the ball bearing! Only the trackball doesn't come out so you can't manually clean it. Very frustrating and I'm currently looking for a new solution. If this trackball will be your daily driver don't expect the legendary reliability of the previous models. This one will only disappoint."
5,gotta love the trackball,"I upgraded from the old one to this one and I was not dissapointed. This mouse is not for drawing, mind you, but really good for games and its awesome not needing a mouse pad"
5,Logitech Trackman Wheel,"Have used these for years and will never go back to chasing a mouse around trying to interface with my computer. Shape fits my hand, only movement is the thumb and fingers no wrist movement at all. These things ROCK!"
5,Wonderful product,I love the trackball mouse. I had one and had to replace it in a hurry. So I bought a regular mouse and have used 2 different ones. I have since ordered a new Logiteh trackball and I am working faster and better with it. I will never use anything else.
3,Great for right handed people,"Logitech always makes great products, and I've only got two complaints about this mouse, which wouldn't even be complaints if I hadn't had the pleasure of using the other Logitech trackball mice.If you're right handed, you won't have much to complain about. BUT, if you're left handed, you can't use this mouse. This was not a concern for me when I bought it, but it turned out that for the left handed people who also sometimes use my computer, it's impossible--they adapted by using their right hands, which was hard.Also for web surfing, this model doesn't have back and forward buttons, both of which are on the other Logitech trackball mice and are more useful than they might sound. This model does have scroll, which is useful for many applications, including reading web pages and scrollings in graphics programs, and the others don't.I guess you can't have everything in one mouse, but Logitech sure comes close."
4,Good-ness,"I have an older version of this item. I like the older ergonomical design. I have had it for many years, and I needed another one for work. Over all this is a very good item stands the test of time. Nice clean movement with the trackball."
4,Great product!,"Good useful tool. . . except is not impervious to cat hair.My cat loves the computer station so I weekly have to unscrew the back and get the fur balls out of the roller ball area. Would be nice to have a quicker, easier way of cleaning it!"
5,Great Product!!!,"I'm fan of the trackball, in méxico is very difficult get one of these, finally i made it throught Amazon, is great, confortable, adjust to my hand, having the ball on the left adjust to my fingers to press both buttons, i'm very satisfied with muy purchase."
4,Great buy,"I bought this type of mouse because I have had issues with carpel tunnel syndrome and wanted to see if it made a difference. I think it has. I use it about 9-10 hours/day and it has felt much better than a traditional wheel mouse. I am not really used to the ball for the thumb yet, and it slows me down a bit, but I think it is worth it."
4,"Does the job, but the ball seems a little loose and inaccurate.",Amazon as usual had a great price and quick free shipping. The unit has generally the same build quality as other logiech devices. The one nit I have is that the ball is loose and does not track as firmly as I remember.
4,Not quite there...,"I had a Microsoft Trackball Optical which the Logitech replaces. What I like is that the Logitech's trackball remains smooth to scroll compared to the MS one which has a tendency to ""gummy up"" even after immediate cleaning. However, I wish it had a bigger trackball like the Trackball Optical or the Logitech Trackball Marble. I also wish it had the 2 extra buttons like those two. I think it'll take a bit more time before I can tell if it's really good for me or not."
5,Amazing mouse but needs more features,"I love this mouse, I hate track-pads and regular mice but trackballs are the best. Its the most comfortable and easiest to use once you get used to it (although many people will tell you differently). The only thing I would change is for this one to have more features, such as volume control (i downloaded an application that turns the wheel into volume control), left to right scrolling, to name a few."
5,Best track ball mouse,I have had other mice with the track ball on top which quickly proved difficult to use for long periods of time. This is my second Logitech trackman with the roller ball for the thumb. I will buy another one when this one dies. Great product for those who are on the computer for long periods of time.
2,Trackman,"I ordered this item because I had been using an older model that become defective, but now I wish that I had chosen a regular mouse. This model has a scroling wheel that rubs and irritates the index finger when you use the left button.Also, this wheel which serves as the double click button, is hard to operate. Since I had already opened the CD, (which was not really needed) I could not return the item. I will have to go to the regular mouse, even though I have limited space for it."
3,roller ball,"Bought this mouse to remove pressure form my wrist. It helps, but sometimes the ball is stiff and a little frustrating because the mouse is still new."
3,"Works great, just not heavy enough","The trackball weorked quite wwell, but i found its way to light and it slides. Thats the only complaint. if you dont mind the weight, this is a great item"
5,Even Use if For My Laptop,"My last laptop was stolen, along with this mouse. This really isn't a portable mouse, but I'm so hooked on the thumb action and the fact that you don't have to have ""clean"" space around you, that it makes for a perfect travel / laptop mouse. (just bind the extra cord together so there isn't so much cable). I've since replaced my PC notebook with my first MacBook and am buying another Trackman to put in the computer bag with it."
3,"Good, but...","Good product, but my ring finger inadvertantly pushed the right button at times when it was the wrong button. I have changed it to a trackball without the wheel."
5,Great Product,"I have never been able to use a scroll pad to get precise control of the cursor, and the buttons below the pad are not convenient for me. With the trackball, my control is instant, stable and precise. Furthmore, I don't have to have a lot of space to move a mouse around. I have worn out several of these over the years because I use the computer 8-10 hours per day. There was no hesitation in replacing them with the same product. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this great product, since you can't find it in retail stores. I only wish it was available in Bluetooth. I would pay a lot for that, hint, hint."
3,Ergonomics,"I have a small hand and I could not get comfortable with the the trackball mouse. It was too large and I found myself having to strain to operate the track ball while keeping my hand on/near the mouse buttons. In addition, since I only used the trackball for a day or so, I could not get the precision I am accustomed to. However, I returned the trackball for a more traditional-type mouse, the Logitech wireless Optical Laser Mouse (that I use with my regular computer and keyboard) and I LOVE it for its comfort and precision. Hands dowen the best mouse i have ever used."
2,Not Good! My Hand goes to sleep!,"I have trackballs on every computer in the house. They aren't optical like this one, but I wish they were. No more cleaning!But I can't for the life of me operate this one like the others. I am used to the index finger moving the ball and the thumb doing the clicking, so I am constantly fighting this thing! Plus my thumb doesn't have the range of motion that my finger does, so it isn't as easy or as quick to move as the other kind!The part that really gets me though, is that my little finger and ring finger goes to sleep and then I get pins and needles!Maybe you can get used to it, but I won't! Will be replacing this thing ASAP."
1,Not happy with it and it's gone!,"I remember back when the ball had some mass. On this newest model the ball is so light it's too easy to work. How is that a problem for me? I wanted to get away from mousing on my desk. Having used the older model before I was looking forward to that familiarity. I feel it is easier to control and develop a feel for something that gives you feedback, that let's you feel something as you work with it, not just skate away.They have gone the way of most everyone else, cheapen it up and sell it for the old price. Sorry, it isn't for me."
4,Nice product,"Everything is great about this product, just wish the software allowed me to assign different functions for each botton."
3,Not as good as the old logitech marble,"This mouse has plastic beads to hold the marble in place instead of the metal ones of the old logitech marble. I think this diminishes the fluidness of the movement and makes it more jittery, but Not as much as some others, though, like the microsoft intellimouse, which is total junk.The buttons are too close together. Not a good gaming mouse like the old marble. Good for the cheap price only."
3,"Nice, but could be better.","Bought this for a second computer, and after hooking it up I realized there were no back or forward buttons, which for me is not good. It is easy to use, but lacks in overall function as opposed to what I am used to."
2,"Stopped the pain, but quit working after 7 months!","I am a regular PC user, who spends 4-8 hours per work day on my computer. I experienced repetitive-use-injury tingling in my wrist after using a ""regular"" mouse for years, but once I purchased this one, the tingling and night-time numbness went away! However, I am very sad to say that this mouse ""died"" after 7 months. It is a bit too pricey to be so ""disposable."" Terrible."
2,"Trackball too light, does not roll smoothly",I am kind of disappointed with this product considering the great reviews I read before purchasing it. I had a Logitech stationary trackball mouse in 2001 that I loved but this one is no where nearly as good. Another reviewer mentions that the weight of the trackballs have been a lot lighter in the recent models. That is exactly what is wrong with this product. When you roll the ball with your thumb it tends to bounce around within its socket instead of rolling smoothly. The older trackball mouse I had was very smooth and had a much heavier ball.I am a web designer and like to work quickly so adapting to this mouse hasn't been easy. But I am getting used to it so it isn't horrible. It helps with wrist pain and is functional but it definitely is not a 4 or 5 star product.
3,Smaller than the Trackman Marble+,"My Trackman Marble+ went bad and I got this as a replacement. It just doesn't fit my hand as well. The Marble+ left my wrist above the surface the mouse rests on, but with this, half my palm rests on the table. It is higher in profile and steeper. It does not accomodate you're entire hand.Another difference from the Marble+ is that the right-click button is clicked using the middle finger.Its good, but I miss my Marble+."
4,It works for me,"This is a very solid trackball based mouse. While I normally use the Microsoft Trackball Optical, this is a nice alternative. The only thing I wish this mouse had were a set of side buttons for scrolling forward and backwards. But other then that I've got no complaints. Plus, unlike the Microsoft Trackball, you can still by this one in the store."
5,So good she stole it,"I've used this kind of mouse for five years now, and I have to buy a new one. Not because it broke, not because I can't find it, but because my mom liked it so much, she stole it. The origional that I bought, which was bought used, is still going! I'll never buy a different kind!"
2,Logitech Trackman Wheel should be more popular!,"Very convenient mouse. Why would you want to move your wrist/arm when you can do it all, and more precisely, with your thumb? The scroll wheel doubles as zoom in games like Spore. Ball rolls smoothly on three jeweled? bearings. Easy to clean with a few wipes of a cue tip. MTBF of the button microswitches based on my experience is several years. (error in ""stars"" rating. I rated 4 or 5 stars on all categories)"
2,New smaller trackball got too small!!,"I have been using the ""white"" optical trackball since they came out, I think in 1998 or so. The ""old"" size was a perfect fit for the hand, but the new size is just too small. My hand cramps up after about an hour of use; I would actually rather use a mouse than this little thing. Also, the trackball does not appear to be removable for cleaning as the white one was (and it needs it about once a week). If you are thinking of replacing your old white one with one of these think twice, I was sure disappointed and am hunting down old white ones..Scott LeeCAD engineer"
5,Bought thru Amazon -- Shipped by TigerDirect,"I wanted to buy/try the Trackman (desperately) even though Amazon did not offer ""free shipping"" at that time... I am extremely happy I got it before delivery due-date...Now I'm more at ease with Amazon Marketplace Vendors like TigerDirect."
4,So far so good,It takes a couple days to get used to using the ball with your thumb but it's rather comfortable. I had wrist pain before when I used a regular mouse and with this mouse I still get pain but I can be on the computer a lot longer before I begin to feel it. My only concern is how the ball can't be removed for maintenance or cleaning. When it is acting sluggish I like to give the ball a good roll (like in the Golden Tee golf game) and the ball will respond better.
3,Takes awhile to get used to.,"First, I'm not used to using a trackball - thus perhaps my own problem. But I suspect that others may have the same problem of adjusting to this input method. One complaint though, the scroll wheel is extremely slow - by that I mean that it takes a lot of turning to move the screen down or up. This speed may be adjustable, but I don't see any way to adjust. Overall, not bad, but it may take me a little longer to become proficient with it _ have only had it for one week."
2,Logitech Trackman Wheel Mouse,"This mouse just didn't work for me, and I had to send it back. It feels comfortable, but when you move the wheel instead of the mouse to move the cursor, you can only move it so far, and then you have to lift your thumb and put it back at the starting point to move it some more. In other words, the movement can't be a sweep from one place to another."
3,just doesnt feel right,"as much as i thought using your thumb for the trackball is a good idea, its just not very comfortable compared to using regular trackballs. i've only tried it for a day though so i'll try using it some more. currently i enjoy using the kensington trackballs, the slingblade trackball and the expert trackball are nice."
4,"Awesome, Accurate, and fast","I've been a big fan of the trackball for years and have tried many different brands...Best perfomance goes to Logitech (even previous versions of this model).However, unlike the previous model, this one is small in comparison and I have large hands....my wife LOVES it though.Drivers were somewhat easy to install, though it's a good idea to remove any other mice/trackball drivers first due to conflicts.Overall...excellent product."
4,TrackBall,"I use architctural drafting programs in a very small office, and my wrists began to ache with all the shifting and moving i had to do with a regular mouse. I decded for the TrackBall, and am very pleased with it. I have small hands but the shape contours very nicely, and the ball rolls very smoothly. It is reat since i do not have to flail around anymore to get from one point to another on my drafts, and also I no longer have contend with a mouse-ball that stalls, gets stuck, or randomly moves."
5,Price??????,"Why is this thing listed at $208!? Should I take mine to Antiques Roadshow?I've had one for a number of years but I guess they wear out. In any event I find the cursor gets a little unstable and can jump about and some inadvertent touches also create a problem. I have found that cleaning the ball and the ""cup"" can help but does not cure everything and it reverts to bad behavior fairly quickly. Resetting the speed, etc. on the control panel does not seem to be much help.Because I have arthritic hands and wrists this is more comfortable for me, minimizes required desk space and interference with documents I am working from, and with experience it can be quicker and more accurate; a sing flick of my index finger can often get my cursor immediately to the spot it needs to be.I was looking to replace mine (which I am using right now) but the listed price ($70 and up used can't be right)."
5,so comfortable,"This mouse is perfect. Finally! A mouse that stays put...my fingers do the work, which helps my wrists. I am so pleased with how easy it is to ""roll"" the ball with my thumb, while clicking away with my index or middle finger."
3,Comfy,"Very comfortable, still jerky when using it to click on small things, probably don't have it set up quite right, but love it otherwise. I'll have to READ the instructions and make sure I have the setting speeds correct."
4,Not too bad at all.,"It is definately better than what I had. I was using a normal optical mouse, but I didn't have the space on my desk to move it around. This doesn't have to be moved at all. I suppose that if I had more room I would go back to a normal mouse, but that doesn't mean this is not any good. It is just not as responsive unless you turn the sensativity up, then it gets hard to be precise. All said though... it is a great product."
4,I got what I wanted...,"This is my second Logitech Trackball Wheel, it is a little less accurate than my first one that you could use the fingers - this one you have to use the thumb, but is not a problem. It looks great, have a good ergonomics, and the value is certainly much more than you will pay. I approve n recommend."
4,Great device but price is all wrong.,"You can buy the wireless version for $50 but you are charging $210 for an older model which uses a wire? I have this same one at work and wanted to get one for my pc at home, but not for this price. I'll go to staples and pay $50 for the wireless.Someone needs to double check the pricing."
3,great in its day,"I still use the trackman wheel optical on my desktop after 4 years of use. Doesn't look too bad considering its been dropped often and still works well.Cons - wired and wires even well concealed get caught, tangled, and in the way."
4,Trackman mouse,I find using this product is excellent for those with limited space. There is no need to move the mouse around and it is ergonomically a good fit.
3,Good product but not used to,"It is a good product but I am not used to use this. Sometimes it irritates me while selecting image from one screen corner to another. It skips in between and then I need to reselect.For simple clicks and scrolls, I dint face any issue but selecting a big portion of screen (or image) is pain."
5,Save your wrist,"Spares the wrist from awkward movements that we usually do with mouse, the device is somewhat larger than the regular ones but thats perfect as it allows the palm to fully rest on it. Tracker ball is also positioned well with respect to the thumb. Left and Right buttons are right under where the fingers rest. The sensitivity of the mouse can be customized using the Logitech software. Pointing accurately using tracker ball with the thumb could be a challenge initially particularly while selecting items from quick launch where the icons are tiny. It can be desensitized but that would mean more scrolling thumb action while moving across the monitor. If you find a balance it works like a charm."
1,READ the license! Unethical policy...,"Intuit has a ""sunset policy"" in the license agreement of only providing support for 3 years. I understand the sunset concept, the manufacturer can't support a product forever, however that is not what Intuit's policy is limited to...What you need to realize is that after 3 years, they DISABLE key functionality of the software, forcing you to upgrade to the next version.I was a SATISFIED user with Quicken 2004. However, I had to upgrade because Intuit disabled the key functionality of being able to download transactions from my bank.Instead of forcing me to upgrade with a ""timebomb policy"" how about creating a product that I want to upgrade to?Imagine if Honda came to your house and disabled your car after 3 years?Look for other software solutions! Don't become an Intuit crack addict."
1,Don't Upgrade to this Program. It crashes and has many flaws,"I have upgraded from Quicken 2006 to Quicken 2007. Quicken 2007 is constantly crashing. It does this during must attempts to download on-line transactions. ALso, I don't know if anyone else is having this problem, but Quicken 2007 is not allowing me to use the key board to copy and paste. The enter and tab key don't work either. I hope you like your mouse. I am returing mine to the store. I did call Quicken Support, they ran me through some stuff that helped, but it didn't solve it completely. My experience has been that every version since 2004 has gotten much worse.***Also, Quicken makes the registration very deceptive on this one. I don't want to use there on-line access. I have had personal information stolen twice now, so I really don't want to give very valuable personal information to a company.***Keep your old file if you upgrade."
2,A real pain to use,"I wish I hadn't bought this product, but now that I have it, I'm kind of stuck. It's enormously unintuitive. It only fitfully downloads information from my bank account. It won't let me delete old, defunct accounts. It's difficult to navigate its menus. But, I will keep it since it lends some organization to our finances."
3,Good organization but does not handle CDs correctly,"For the most part, I enjoy using the Quicken software. The electronic downloading of transactions is great, but many financial institutions do not support it due to the high cost charged by Intuit. The most disappointing part is that there is not a built-in type for CDs -- you have to manually manage them as if they were a stock fund."
1,Misleading features,"I had this software for 5 minutes when I decided I wanted a refund. I entered my personal info, entered my bank info and it told me that I needed a separate username and pin from my bank which could take 10 days to get (Citibank by the way). I called Citi for the pin and they told me the arrangement with Intuit is one where they charge $9.95 A MONTH for access to download data into Quicken. Sorry, but no -- that's not worth it. I'll hop over to Microsoft for a try with Money."
1,Worthless Garbage,"I've been a Quicken user for over 10 years now. This new release is without a doubt, and by far, the worst offering to date. It's not only the worst Quicken version so far, it's the worst software products of any kind I have ever used."
1,Don't Do It!!,"We have used Quicken for years. Now with 2007 we have hit some problems for which there seems to be no fix. The worst thing is the support. All support is done in India, I don't care about that, but I do care that the support people are ill-trained, are not familiar with what the program does and cannot answer simple questions with correct answers. I have had nothing but trouble trying to find out when a simple check printing problem will be fixed, if ever. I would stay with the older version, if it is working for you and don't waste your money."
2,Not worth the cost,"My investments screens now have both vertical and horizontal scroll bars, where previously they had none. There is too much real estate taken up by the new look&feel;, which leaves less space for my data.Also, one of the new features allows for multiple investment accounts with the same financial organization. However, this messed up both investment accounts as it put the investments into the wrong one!"
3,"OK, but not really worth it.","I upgraded this weekend from Quicken 2005 to the 2007 version.Good news: No problems, everything is working fine.So-so news: I don't really see anything much different, other than some fancier graphics and shading that, if anything, makes the presentation of information more difficult to read.Oh well, since they typically cut people off from the stock update service after three years, I would have to update next year anyway.I did get the latest R2 version, so perhaps that is the reason I encountered no bugs or crashes."
3,Filling in the blanks...,"1. QIF support went away a few years back, this is nothing new. Many banking institutions support QFX.2. Often times with Quicken releases, there are no dramatic changes between releases, just enough changes to make it look like management is doing something to improve and release a new product.3. My experience as a Quicken user since 1990 has been that it is always best with Quicken releases to wait until the first patch release is available before buying. This has become more apparent in the year 2000+ releases. Intuit outsources a lot of their functions overseas, so they lose efficiency and control with their product development and support. While overseas services help improve a balance sheet so the CEO can reap bigger performance bonuses, it often yields lower quality and services in the end. Just an unfortunate product of corporate greed sending work to the lowest-bidding country."
1,Keeps rashing when I update my bank accounts,"I had no problems with Quicken 2006, however 2007 has major problems. Support for Quicken which is apparently in India provides no help and leads you to believe the problem is with your data file. They asked to try to duplicate the problem in a new test file and now I am locked out of bank's online banking. DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
1,Intuit continues its streak of terrible products,"Intuit continues its streak of terrible products, August 30, 2007By E. L. Edsall - See all my reviewsI have purchased Quicken 2005, 2006 & now 2007. I should have learned; Intuit doesn't care about improving their products; just selling them. And, what you have a problem with their buggy softare? Get out you credit card and pay $29.95 to speak and listen (carefully at that because the person is in India - can you say impossible to understand on the telephone) and be told that the problem is with your file. Oh, wow great but I thought it was your software. The truth is it is the software; full of more bugs than a 10 day old animal. Don't take my word for it; look at the forums under quicken.com. Thousands of disgruntled users. Where are those class action lawyers when we need them!"
1,Can no longer recommend Quicken,"Unfortunately, Quicken has continued its decline with this release. There are significant problems with screen display updates (unless you like staring at a flickering display while you wait for it to update), and, most importantly, is is almost useless for investment tracking, due to frequent errors from Quicken's update servers. Their tech support is unresponsive (I suspect all off-shore), and this has been getting worse for the last year.Anyone thinking of buying this should spend some time in the forums and see what issues users are having before making the decision to depend on this.I speak as one who has used Quicken since the very early days, but I'm out of here unless they put some resources into fixing issues."
3,Quicken upgrade,"Overall nice features. A couple things that are just plain annoying though. The mouse clicking on the left side of the screen on the accounts, drops down a small menu that effectively blocks your view of the next item in the list. As if this isn't annoying enough, this also has full reign in all of the registers, so you cannot see the next item in the list below the one you clicked on until you click on something else. This is really a major annoyance, but otherwise the product works well and is very intuitive."
2,"Crappy, but work when it wants to.",Quicken needs to get some good updates and stio chaiging the color and a few words and call it a new version. Can't wait for another company. What happen to MS Money
1,very buggy,"I've been using Quicken for many years. While I like the interface, it has been getting more and more buggy just about every year. The 2007 version is the worst I have used so far. And their technical support is not good at all. Eventually they may help solve a problem, but it's only after many tries.Also if you are getting the premier version because of the investment management there's 1 bug they already told me they cant (or wont) fix. When you try to drill down into your asset allocation to understand a certain asset class, it always includes the cash asset class along with the one you really are trying to look at."
1,Turn and Run,"I've used Quicken for years. The 2004 worked wonderful. Then, Quicken automatically shut down this year and forced me to buy an upgrade. I hate upgrades but I had to get Quicken 2007 since I had years of financial history. The 2007 upgrade sucks. Checks were reported as written to unknown parties. I thought somone stole my identity. Forget about asking Quicken for help. One day I spent four hours with my banker trying to figure out the problem. Calling Quicken is like calling the moon -- forget it, Quicken, don't just walk, run from this upgrade."
4,Quicken 2007 hurts my eyes!,"If teal green isn't one of your favorite colors, then you're going to find that using Quicken 2007 will make you nauseous. In fact, you may want to delay your upgrade until Intuit addresses this issue. I wish I had.It seems like it would be a simple matter for Intuit to offer users a choice of theme colors or skins. Or perhaps someone could write a software patch to do this?I like the way Quicken 2006 looks and wish that 2007 kept the same look and feel. Other than that, it is an excellent program with only a few minor flaws."
1,Do not upgrade to this.,"This version of quicken is terrible. If you are updating from another version of quicken, as I did, you will just be heading for trouble. Several things broke when I did this. I am definitely asking for my money back. I have spent several hours with technical support without making any progress. It is absolutely not worth it."
3,Pretty user interface but still does not handle bank CDs,"I decided to upgrade from 2006 hoping that Quicken 2007 would handle certificates of deposit. Unfortunately, it does not. When I download transactions from Schwab containing CDs, I need to go into the transaction list and edit each of these transactions. Then I need to go into the Performance screen and update the value of the CD so Quicken will correctly display the value of the account containing the CD - kind of defeats the purpose of a software application designed to simplify managing your investments.If you have a number of bank and investment accounts and do not have any CDs, you may want to consider this product. If you use certificates of deposit don't waste your money on 2007, it will only complicate your life."
1,If you enjoy spending hours resolving technical problems this product is for you!,"I wish Quicken was as good at making a quality product as they are accepting your money. Their online download works flawlessly, their product operates erratically and they look to charge you $25 per incident to fix these problems for you. I'm thinking I will just stick with my banks software and chalk my Quicken purchase up to a lesson learned."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I have bought the newest version every year and this version is terrible. My screen flickers & jumps. I even tried throttling back my video card adjustment. I tried to go back to version 2006, but once you convert your files to the newest version they cannot be read by older versions. Quicken is slipping bad.I have tried working with their support dept. with no luck. They say they know about the problem, have no patch yet. Maybe I will MS money next year?"
4,"Aaah, memories...","This was my first Frost album. I remember sitting in my car after parking just to hear the end of the album, thinking ""Man, if I could record just one album, I'd want it to sound just like this."" The orchestration, and operatic vocals mixed with the metal was way ahead of it's time. The lyrics were thoughtful and intelligent. I always liked the way the Frost lyrics were vague and open to interpretation, like insightful poetry. This was a major step ahead in te world of metal, but most folks, even the early fans weren't ready for this. After buying Morbid and Therion, I understood more why they thought this was TOO different. I'll bet they thought this was solid gold compared to Cold Lake though,ha ha! This album is highly recommended."
2,Nostalgia Only,"I am a fan of the old sound of CELTIC FROST. Unfortunately this record's a bait and switch in my view. Looks amazing, should be killer, but ultimately a record who's sucker punch approach to distance the band from its contenders back in the day fails miserably. I give this record 2 stars in total.1 star for the title, cover art, layout, production and the band's attempt with"" Babylon Fell "".The second star is given for "" Inner Sanctum "", the only song on this album worth the actual time spent recording its entirety."
1,Beginning of the end of Celtic Frost,"This is the album where Celtic Frost began to get ""experimental"". By ""experimental"", I mean they began to incorporate classical instruments, opera, and worst of all incessant whining, crying and blubbering instead of vocals. The lame experimental electronica and hip hop beats don't help elevate this album either. The fact that the previous two albums were metal masterpieces is what really makes this ""experimentation"" a real shame. Not only is this album boring and pretencious but its also REALLY REALLY ANNOYING to listen to."
5,Nothing comes close,"The Frost - simply the best (until Cold Lake, which sucked). Into the Pandemonium was the best album by a band which was never respected as much as it should have been. Groundbreaking mix of metal and classical instruments, plus awesome riffs such as my favourite track ""I Wont Dance"".Buy it, and live again."
3,Influential,"Thomas Gabriel Warrior is an icon, but this is easily the least of the Celtic Frost albums I've heard. To Mega Therion is a lot heavier and Cold Lake better written. But still not bad for a group that would influence black metal in the 80s to today. Key tracks are: Mexican Radio, Mesmerized and Sorrows of the Moon. I wouldn't recommend it unless you need to hear every Celtic Frost album."
4,Not for everyone,"When these dudes came to town, they were booed of the stage. This album is strange. The Mexian Radio cover is silly, maybe fun for a listen. Other tracks are pretty far out metal tunes --> 2 singers (melodic female, monotone male). Some songs have french dialogue with classical music. Ive played this for many people who thought it was horrible. Celtic Frost went on to record some diverse music, most of it forgettable(i.e. glam rock when it had already died).Surprising album, most people wont like it. But it is refreshingly creative. Good for metal fans or collectors with eclectic tastes.I like it because it is heavy, interesting, different, creative and of course dark, brooding evil metal. Wish I could describe it better."
1,Only for Extreme Felix Historians Only,"This DVD has attractive packaging, well designed menus and good background on the animations....BUT viewing the shorts is difficult. They are mostly grainy, dark in contrast, and some are so damaged they are painful to watch. There has been no attempt to restore these films on any level and the prints are as rough as I have seen in ANY silent era film on DVD currently available. The music score makes no attempt to compliment the action, but it's just honkytonk piano playing random songs in the background. I give this DVD 1 star for content and historic value, but for viewing enjoyment, its a dud."
4,Felix the Cat - Felix!,"Great stuff! Felix the cat is of course classic animation at it's best.Crazy stuff that has obviously been a big influence on the animation that came later... and still influences. This DVD is great news for any animation lover, although they could have thrown in a few extras."
5,Please Release More,"I'm suprised Felix is so hard to find (without even getting ripp-ed off). This set is pretty cool. Other reviewers say there are bonus colored cartoons as well but I cound't find them. Luckily I have those on the 600 cartoon collection with even more 1920's Felix cartoons included. It would be pretty sweet if they release more of his 1920's era. I'll buy them, whether they would be in volumes or in a complete set. Oh, and please also release the complete series of Twisted Tales OF Felix The Cat. Thanks!"
2,There Are Better Options,"I decided to get this thinking that since it shows color artwork on the cover that it would reflect upon this DVD having some of the cartoons by Felix that we come to know and love. Unfortunately only the last 2 cartoons were in color and, the rest were really really old and primitive black and white animations that only either a die hard fan of Felix or someone old enough to actually remember these cartoons would enjoy. If you are looking to buy any Felix DVD for the fun, entertaining and colorful cartoons that made Felix as popular as he is today I think you would be far better off instead buying the 1958 or later cartoon series."
5,great value,This is a great value... So far it has worked well. I think the other cables in regular stores are overpriced.
3,Works but .....,This FireWire Cable works for my Sony Camcorder to Macbook. But quality is something which can be better in terms of durability. Data transfers well but the outer coating of the cable itself is already falling off so I am not sure how long will it last. I will go for a better one. But for the price it may be a acceptable compromise.thanks.
1,Dead on arrival,"This cable was supposed to replace my 3ft cable between my Buffalo external Firewire RAID and my Toshiba Laptop running Windows 7, Ubuntu 10.04 and Mac OS 10.6.4. In none of the OSes this cable could establish connectivity. Plugging any of my other 3ft cables in established connectivity right away.I do not have any other devices to connect with this cable, but I am pretty sure that I am not dealing with a length issue here. If the cable was too long for the voltage I think my FW HD would at least be somewhat visible to any my OSes, instead of complete silience.So I need to classify this Belkin cable as defective right out-of-the-box and am returning it. Am ordering this one now insteadhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PRE1XI/sr=1-18/qid=1279431265/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me;=&qid;=1279431265&sr;=1-18&seller;="
2,Nice Cable but not for all Apples,Nice cable but it does not fit my late model macbook pro. It may fit the older macbooks.The description needs to be changed.
5,"Great product, Can't beat the price!","I ordered this 1394 cable to retrieve some videos I had stored in more than 25 DV tapes. My video cam is the Sony HandyCam DCR-HC21, which is no longer compatible with WIndows 7. I installed the software directly from Sony website that allows Win7 function with the handycam via a i-Link cable that Sony recommends. Their i-Link cable costs over 65 dollars. For a cable! I decided to try this one here, and what do you know...!! I have all my videos right now in DVDs! It took 110+ DVDs to store all my videos, but hey! they are safe and we can go back and share the memories on our flat screen... priceless! This cable rocks! Don't pay so much for a i-Link cable, this here does the trick. And another plus, this cable is very long! Nice! Will store it forever in case I need it again."
1,Never again!,Wrong parts for what I ordered it for and they said it was the off brand and it sure was! I would have returned if it were worth my time and effort to do so!
1,This product was for an OLD apple computer...,"This product was for an OLD apple computer....when I bought it, I had to purchase an extension for it to fit into the new Apple computer. I didn't return it as I had already sent to overseas to my grandson."
5,Great Deal,Great deal! Best Buy wanted $29.99 for the same product. Life saver to copy videos from my old Canon video camera to my PC. You MUST have a firewire port on your PC...will not work to USB.
5,Affordable and quick,"If your system can handle firewire, try this cheap affordable alternative to usb 2 if you don't have firewire 800 or usb 3.0"
3,4 pin 4 pin,The item I purchased was as described and came timely. It does not work with the canon camcorder that I own.
1,Not for an IMAC,I bought this to transfer Mini DV Video from my camera to an IMAC and the cable does not fit. Maybe this is my fault but my research indicated this was the cable I needed.
5,works exactly as described,"we are using this to transfer our video from our handycam. It gives superior results to usb transfer, in our experience. Older pcs may require Firewire cards, too."
5,Great product!,"Good transfer speed for transferring video from my Sony Handycam!!It took a lot of research and many full video tapes before I decided that this was what I needed to transfer video from my Sony Handycam. The problem was, the Sony manual only specified an ""ilink"" and gave very little information on what an ilink was. It took hours to find out that it's just Sony's name for a firewire cable. Then the question was ""which firewire would fit my handycam and PC connections?"" Pictures of firewires sold on amazon showed that this was the one.It was pure heaven when I plugged it in and I was finally able to download video to my PC."
4,Does what I needed.,I purchased this item to download from my video camera. I'm not up on electronics and this item was recommended to me by the specific item name. It does what I need done. I was able to download my video to my computer. I am very satisfied.
5,Belkin Firewire Cable,Cable worked great and now I have no problem getting video into my PC. Well worth the price paid for it.
5,can't beat the price,I'm amazed at the mark up on cables at the big box stores. I mean $30 for a cable I can get for $5?
4,it does exactly what it's supposed to do,"great product for someone who needs reliability. the braided cable feels like it will last forever, it is stiff but that can easily be worked around. I highly recommend it and you just cannot beat the pricetag"
2,watch out,do you really want to buy it ... It's a 4 to 6pin connector.I bought it by mistake for my handycam and later found out that i need a 4 to 4 pin connector.
4,Compatibility,Nothing wrong with this project. It was not compatible with my dell laptop. I had returned it and ordered 4-pin/4-pin cable.
4,Great FireWire Cable,"I bought this item to transfer movies from a DV camera to my computer, the cable works great and it was cheaper (with shipping) than cables that were available at my local BestBuy and Radio Shack. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a FireWire Cable."
5,Belkin F3N401-06-ICE-IEEE 1394-4-Pin/6-Pin Mbps FireWire Cable (6 Feet),The Belkin F3N401-06-ICE-IEEE 1394-4-Pin/6-Pin Mbps FireWire Cable (6 Feet)cable has met my needs. I needed a cable for my 5 year old HP computer. I'm using a Sony DCR-TR510 Handycam Video. I'm also using Adobe Premier Pro 7.0. When plugging the cable into my Fire Wire port and starting Premier the program is able to control the Sony Video Camera. Its doing exactly what I need it to do with this equipment. The Belkin cable is well worth buying. I have had the cable for a few months and so far I have not had any problems.
2,If you have the patience...,"I stayed up late one night, not reading, but ""leafing"" through this 615 page document, inserting bookmarks for each of the approximately 120 stories. This appears to be the only way of creating a usable, if crude, table of contents. So two stars. Five for the work itself, minus 1 each, for the three hours I spent at this tedious task.By the way, I recently purchased Abelardo Castillo's Cuentos Completos, also published by Alfaguara.Cuentos completos (Spanish Edition)This one comes with a thoroughly interactive t.o.c., so it appears that someone at Amazon or Alfaguara got the message."
4,"Very complete, but no index","This is a 5 stars hands down for content, but it lacks an index. You can still navigate between stories with the ""LEFT"" and ""RIGHT"" keys, and you can use the search function, but it would of been easier with an index."
5,New Vitality,"I'm a retired police officer with 27 years of service. Of those 27 years, staying in good condition was always available. Since retirement I have found a new and exciting way to continue to stay conditioned with the exercises in this DVD. The inspirational message offered helps, not only in body but mind and spirit also."
2,Not Pleased With This DVD,"I ordered this DVD hoping to start a yoga routine that would, as the title suggests, help me ""Release Stress and Lose Weight"". I am very dissapointed and after watching once (as suggested) and then participating the second time. I feel confused as to what I am supposed to gain from this or how to put it to use daily. While she, Suzanne Andrews, does present and demonstrate some yoga poses and moves it is choppy and there is no routine to it at all. The pauses in between poses are distracting and I don't find her voice or facial expressions to be soothing or natural.I am very sorry to say I spent good money on this one!"
2,"For beginners... or really tired people, maybe.","I used this DVD only once, when I was first getting into yoga. Even for a beginner I was bored out of my mind. I didn't even break a sweat and did not feel like I worked out anything. It was far too easy. I would only recommend this to an elderly or really, really out of shape person."
5,A great way to take calcium,"My good friend was diagnosed with osteopenia, where the density in bones is lower than they should be (a precursor to osteoporosis). After two years of taking this product along with vitamin D, her bones are back to normal.Diagnosed with osteoporosis earlier this year (2012), I started taking Ionic Mineral Calcium about 4 months ago. I have not had a subsequent bone density test, so I cannot speak to its effectiveness personally yet (it takes a while to rebuild bone density). I can, however, say that it is the easiest way I have found to take calcium supplements that are 100% absorbable (hence the seemingly small amount of calcium) without overloading my system with hard to process calcium pills or powders.I take it along with Vitamin D AND Vitamin K (which helps bones to stay flexible -- a great hedge against breaks).It has virtually no taste, goes down like water."
5,Fantastic Invasion....a fantastic voyage,Fantastic Invasion is Douglas Adams in Africa galoshes and all....discovering new tribes like the WaBenzi's and the like. This is a look at the modern African continent with a bit of tongue in cheek and none of the paternalism or simplistic viewpoints that normally pervade literature about Africa and its problems. If you are not a sensitive viewer and want your mind blown away by someone that tells it like it is read this journey through Africa. Notwithstanding that this book is more than 20 years old it still has lessons to teach us all.
4,good but not excellent,I enjoyed this CD very much only because of 1 song. The rest was not impressive for me. But it's good in overall.
5,An interesting and extreamly heavy take on black metal...,"This is simply unlike anything ive ever heard before, wonderful black/death metal with fairly good production, and pounding pace. They kindof have that at the gates feel with a naglfar like atmousphere. Great cd"
3,"not exactly ""gospel"" comedy","This DVD did have a few funny moments but I can't say that I'd feel very comfortable showing this to the whole church body. Simply omitting curse words from an act doesn't make the material ""gospel"". I'm not saying that the material wasn't funny. 'just saying that it's not church setting appropriate. I felt a little misled by the title. A more accurate title might be ""Prime Time TV Ready Comedy"" and not ""Gospel Comedy Allstars 2""."
5,Gospel Comedy Allstars 1,"I enjoyed this comedy video and would recommend it to anyone who lobes church but likes a good comedy told in religious style. You will laugh, believe that!"
2,Useful information but...,"didn't have much to do with the exam. Lots of complex math problems, questions about rockets, medical questions, etc. in this book that did not show up on the exam.I spent a lot of time studying this book before the exam and not one question from here was on the test. There were things I had never seen that I had to identify (symbols)on the test that I wasn't prepared for.I passed the test based on what I already knew but my score could have been higher and I could have easily prepared for the test in a matter of days had I known what type of questions were going to be on it.Bottom line: If I were to do this over again I would study from basic study guides online. Maybe the exam has changed but this book has very little to do with the current 943."
2,Too many assumptions,"I was disappointed with this book. Although it is structured reasonably well, the text often seems to assume prior knowledge - ie it talks about elements/actions as though the reader is already familiar with them.Then when you look up the reference in the index to see if there's clarification later on, the item cannot be found.As another reviewer says, there is much better information available both on the Internet and in other books.There's also a lot of irrelevant padding - like pages of quotes from the program developer about the......development of the program. As if it matters.I read it in a few hours and immediately put it up for sale. No takers so far."
1,Wish I hadn't spent the money,"I wish that I'd read the reviews before I bought the book. My version of OneNote is 2007, and the book is about 2003. To top it off, all of the websites mentioned in the book (except the Microsoft site) no longer exist. What a waste of my hard earned money."
5,"What an album, what an experience!","Try listening to `A Storm In Heaven' through headphones whilst lying back on your bed drinking tea. The waves of sound will flow through you and without realising it; the album will have played itself out with the parting message `See You In The Next One (Have a Good Time)'.Strangers to the genre (Like I was) may require a couple of listens before their resistance is completely broken down. However, once your mind has been set free from this cynicism, the album will open up and now reveal its true self. A Storm In Heaven is a magical album, I only wish that The Verve had retained the same ethereality in their later efforts."
5,Great music.,One of the Verve's best records. Full of great songs and sounds. Really happy to have this copy at last.
5,The greatest album of the 90's,"This album by The Verve is one of the most important albums ever. Every single song on here is mind blowing, from the opening song Star Sail, with it's wispy and feathery guitar lines to See you In The Next One( HAve A Good Time). Each song on here is absolutely insanely perfect. These people who are saying the sound quality is poor and offensive, I have one name for you....John Leckie, he's a genius and if you know anything about anything in British music you would know what he's capable of. I must say this album redefined a lot of parameters in music for the 90's. The Verve are easily the most important band of the 1990's."
5,very helpful,"I have a Down's child. I found this book to be very helpful. There was a bit of weeding of the history of the Institute to be done. But, by following the information I was able to create a program to fit our lifestyle. (It helped to read the other books by the author on Reading, Math, Physical Activity and Knowledge.) I read the author's other books first, and I felt that this book was the missing link I needed to create a program for my child.If you are looking for a Step A, Step B... it is not quite that clear. This is a guideline...not child specific. But, frankly if it was specific I would be very skeptical. How could one program be good for the wide variety of ""brain injured"" children that exist?If you want to help your child, it will take effort on your part. And, it can be time consuming, depending on how far/fast you want your child to advance. But, after only a couple of months mild/moderate effort, I have seen significant progress...and my son amazes his therapists."
3,"NOT a ""how to"" book","A better title for this book might be ""How a wonderful, caring physical therapist labored on behalf of brain-injured children"". It is an interesting story about the admirable life of Glenn Doman. It is NOT a book about what to DO with your brain-injured child. There was literally no specific information about therapy techniques or teaching protocols. It was not a wasted purchase because it is a beautiful story, but it does not fulfill the promise of the title."
2,Frustrating!,"This book leads you to believe that you will get instructions on ""What to do with your brain injured child."" I found it was more like one man's personal story of the development of a therapy program and the his institute. Details of his analysis and people in his life get tiresome and I found myself often thinking. ""Okay fine. I agree with the principle but what DO I DO?"" There are some sketchy instructions, but I found myself at a loss for how to carry them out since my daughter doesn't understand spoken language. When you are desperate for instructions and frankly don't want to read a story, this book is frustrating!"
5,Breaking the paradigms,"Glenn Doman & his Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential make ground-breaking progress in the treatment of brain-injured children. Where the conventional medical community treats symptoms with medications & surgical interventions, IAHP treats the actual injury by training the brain to learn and develop. This method is controversial, but there are just too many success stories to ignore."
2,Nothing to do.,It's a nice history about the live of the author (really a great doctor) but does not propose any suggestion. It's an advertising about his fantastic method.
5,How Could You NOT Do This For Your Brain-Injured Child?,"This fantastic book taught me more in 2 days than I've learned elsewhere in 2 years. Finally actual help is out there, not just negativity. This is what I expected to learn from my developmental pediatrician, but didn't. It's wonderful to know there are people in this world who give so selflessly for our children. I loved this one so much I ordered ""How to Teach Your Baby to be Physically Superb"" & ""How to Teach Your Baby to Read"" I can't wait to see some real improvement in my daughter!!"
2,What to do about your brain injured child,"While this book has an interesting program and premise, I feel that the subtitle is misleading. Even though the cover mentions ""autism,"" not one of the cases cited in the book is that of an autistic child. All of the cases offered as examples involve children with severe impairments. These are children who are unable to talk, walk, see or hear. They have cerebral palsy or were injured after birth in an accident. Since this is a ""revised and updated edition,"" I feel that the author just put autism and other impairments on the front cover to attract a wider reader base, even though the method doesn't really seem to address the problems of an individual who is higher functioning."
2,"Love the size, very poor durability","I bought this pad for its larger size. I haven't seen any other brands with 34"" length -- those extra inches are really nice for a toddler! However the plastic material tears soooo easily. My last pad (diff't manuf.) held up for 16 months before developing one small tear. This one developed its first tear in the first week and 3 months later it is riddled with big tears. We're so careful when changing our LO and don't wear any rings or bracelets which might snag on the pad, but nonetheless it tears. We now have to buy another smaller one as this one is no longer useable after 3 short months."
1,NO WAY! STAY CLEAR FROM THIS CHANGER,Got this in the mail and the tag attached to this changer pad is DISTURBING.Do not want anything near my newborn with a tag that reads: that there may exist trace amounts of chemicals in this product known to cause cancer and birth defect or other reproductive harm. Was shocked Target / Million Dollar Baby would even sell a product like this. Who would use this on their child with a tag that has this warning? I would like to meet that parent....
3,Interesting Early Hemingway,"Torrents of Spring is a slim work, a short story--I guess. This early, almost experimental (but for the fact that it is a) satire takes to task a number of more verbose, stylistically florid contemporaries. The plot, if you called it that, is linear enough, and the characters are based more on a medley of ideas and events than any real people--displaced from the current of American history swirling around them. It's a nice short read and a must for any Hemingway fan looking for something different."
3,Mad Hannah Rafferty,I thought the way the book was written was excellent. It just didn't necessarily hold my attention for the whole time. Definitely worth purchasing and reading though.
1,blech,"I like watching beautiful naked women get it on as much as the next guy, but two women rubbing themselves against each other doesn't count as sex in my book. The script (what little there is of it) and acting are also pretty bad, not that either of those things is particularly important in this kind of film. Even if the sex scenes were genuinely erotic, though, the whole thing is so badly filmed it's damn near unwatchable. I kept cleaning my glasses, thinking it would help the wretched visual quality. You'd have to be a pretty nondiscriminating sex film fan to like this. Try The Erotic Witch Project or Girl Explores Girl: Alien Encounter instead."
4,"If you like lesbian vampires, then this is your film!!!","Although there's very little dialogue in this movie, the action is highly erotic. This gorgeous vampire babe makes out with a number of beautiful naked women before killing them. But a hot female detective is on her trail. Does the plot really matter? Certainly not! Some of the girl-girl action could have been a bit more imaginative, but hey, this isn't a porn film, right? At the same time, it hardly ranks as a horror film, either! But I KNOW what I like, and I LIKED this film!"
3,NEW MUSIC PLEASE...,When is Marc Anthony coming out with something new?Seems like he stopped working on new stuff once he married J Lo.What a waste of talent.Soon he'll be 50 years old and the voice won't be the same!
3,Could have been better...,"I purchased this cd for my mother who is a HUGE Marc Anthony fan. This cd was okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase another one. I was expecting so much more (new songs, etc.) from Marc. There were too many ballads and not enough salsa. He's had much better in the past."
3,"Good CD, but....","This CD has some good songs, but Marc Anthony has left out the songs that made him great. Where is ""Contra La Corriente"" or ""Y Hubo Alguien"" or ""Hasta Que Te Conoci"".If you want to sample the true greatness of Marc Anthony, skip this one and go listen to ""Desde un Principio: From the Beginning"" That CD is his greatest."
4,Objects of Design from The Museum of Modern Art,"MoMA canonized modern design as it did 20th-century art, and this anthology of pictures and expert texts highlights a collection of 3,708 objects that range in size from microchips to a helicopter. About a tenth of those are illustrated in nine thematic sections. Many are icons, but there are a few surprises, especially among recent acquisitions, where the inventive use of materials supplants functional beauty. Paola Antonelli, MoMA Curator of Architecture and Design, describes the collection as presenting a history of ideas and realizing a part of Alfred Barr's dream of a unity of the arts. She explains how the old selection criteria of truth and beauty have changed while retaining some of their old authority. It's comforting to know that relativism does not yet extend to firearms, making MoMA's collection a gun-free zone. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
3,Very scary music,"This is not the sort of music to listen to while broken down on a dark road waiting for roadside assistance.That said there is a novel attraction to music that skirts the edges of disharmony, although more that a few listens might jeopardise my mental health!"
3,One track wonder,"Ballad Of A Man Long Gone was the best track. For the low price, it was worth it though."
5,differents work cited page style,"If you have a job where your life depends on how well you write reports, or simply attending college for your classes of English comp I and II, this is a plus-plus to have.Different citation syles, even the ones you are not used to it, but you know you have to know about it."
4,If only he could write just wee bit faster,"First, a caveat: I am a die-hard Ian Rankin fan, eagerly snapping up anything he writes the minute I can find it available. If you are familiar with Rankin's wonderfully layered John Rebus, then by all means indulge in his newest title. Replete with political machinations, the basic storytelling is flawless--a great multiple murder mystery! If you are unfamiliar with Rankin's work, some of the nuances of shifting relationships may be lost on you, and that would be a shame. Rebus's complexity is such that over the course of the books featuring him, he becomes better known and more self-destructive with each new title. This is not the Rankin book to start with, but for those who have been interested in Rebus's faltering romantic life and, more importantly, his position at work and on-going thorn in Cafferty's side, the changing dynamics do not fail to satisfy."
3,Solid Police Procedural,"This is a well written police procedural/hard boiled detective novel. Part of a popular series set in Edinburgh and featuring the distinctly hard boiled Detective Inspector Rebus. As with many novels in this genre, Rebus is flawed human being redeemed by his obsessive interest in pursuing the truth and establishing justice, features often unappreciated by his superiors. While hardly at the level of Raymond Chandler, these books are solid examples of the genre, written well with good plotting and creditable characters. Good entertainment reading."
2,The Voice of Dissent,"After reading the other reviews, I wondered if I read the same book. Slow, complex, convoluted. Honestly, Edinburgh does not present the alure that it apparently does to others.Plot focuses around simple greed of land developers and double crossing by the dark side of a seedy lot of players.It took me much too long to connect any of the dots and when I did it was a disappointing picture. First and last visit to Mr. Rankin's world. Buyer Beware."
2,A bit of a mess,"Set in Darkness seemed like a jumbled mess to me. I enjoyed most of the previous books but this one was not a good read. First it was difficult to get into. The plot then is like a tangle of multiple balls of yarn. First a body is found in an old fireplace. Then a tramp throws himself off a bridge leaving behind a lot of money and a politician is murdered. It is clear of course that it will likely all get connected but in the meantime Rebus will pal around with Big Ger, drink too much, possibly hit the sack with an aging celebrity, antagonize colleagues, experience incredible strokes of luck, only to tie it up neatly in the end. Good yarn is usually enjoyable but this seemed like a mess to me."
3,Had to work to stay interested in this one,"While this book was readable, it's not one of the better Rebus novels. It's one of those that I could have taken six months to finish because it didn't really hold my interest but was easy to pick back up whenever. The way the multiple cases tied up into one felt sort of forced in places. As always though, I enjoyed the rapport between Rebus and Siobhan. They're a fantastic pair."
4,set in darkness,"It seems the longer I go with the John Rebus novels the better written they are. Compared to Rankins earlier novels, the plot is much more involved. It seems the more Rebus drinks, the more human he is. I enjoyed the book very much and am looking forward to the next in the series."
4,I Was A Little Disappointed,This was my first Ian Rankin novel. There are three investigations going on in this novel and at the end they all tie in together. John Rebus is well drawn and is interesting. I found the story dragging at times. It's a complex crime novel. I rate this a A-.
4,"Terrific and Comprehensive Cycling Book, But Equipment Section VERY Outdated","This is probably the best overall book on cycling ever written. Very comprehensive and detailed about any and all facets of cycling, including training, diet, bike fit, equipment, and even LeMond's own Tour de France drama, when he battled teammate Bernard Hinault for the crown in '85 and 86. Great read.Only major drawback: the section on equipment is HILARIOUSLY out-of-date. LeMond debates the merits of six-speed freewheels vs seven-speed, for example. Hey Greg, might wanna re-write that chapter sometime, we're up to eleven-speed cassettes these days, at least on Campy.Aside from the equipment section being about 20 years out of date, it's well worth getting."
3,Racing skill is not the same as technical knowledge,"Greg LeMond had a great career as a bicycle racer, but that does not equate to his writing an authoritative book on bicycling. He doesn't correctly describe how to use the brakes effectively, and neither does he have a solid background in how to ride in mixed traffic. From another cyclist, I have heard that LeMond's advice on bike fit can get people into trouble if, like most, they do not share his unusual physical proportions. So, I dip my helmet to LeMond in respect for his stellar racing career and the impression he gives of being a good and generous person; but I suggest other books for detailed technical information on bicycling."
3,"Beautiful print, Odd proportions, Frustrating customer service","I love this O'keefe!!! The color and composition is amazing. First saw a poster of this print at Museum shop many years ago, and had been kicking myself ever since for not purchasing it then and there. The proportions are not a standard size, so you'll either need to crop and mat to fit a standard frame; or custom frame this poster.Now, all that being said, a warning: This print is sold through art.com. So if you receive a damaged item, as i did, you will have to pay for shipment of a replacement. Unlike items purchased from Amazon directly, which are guaranteed. Also, the e-mail and 1-888 phone# listed on the packing slip are incorrect. You'll have to search their site, or Amazon for the correct contact information. More than disappointing, as this was to be a Birthday Gift from my Family, and it has become a real sad headache."
5,I would like to translate it to Swedish,"Being a recognized translator and a Stan Getz fan, I would like to translate the book to Swedish. At the same time I am aware of the fact that certain aspects concerns an important family in Sweden, i.e. Silfverskiold. Anyway, Maggins book is of too great importance to be ignored and Stan Getz is a legend..."
4,Hard to put down.,"I am so fed up with jazz biographies and histories loaded with racial politics. Maggin's book is such a breath of fresh air in that regard. Through this fascinating biography, you learn how collaborative jazz has long been between the races as Getz comfortably performed with white and black musicians. It definitely needs a discography. But given the amount of work Maggin put into detailing Getz's life, he was probably too worn out to tackle a discography. Great book."
3,"Not bad, but not current either","I like this book, but it was published in 1985 and does not include the internet as a resource for projects. If this book was updated it would be great!!"
3,ngongtroi59,"The teaching topics are not well connected, i.e. Discuss about one topic then jump to a practice that not in sequences. The CD is in very poor quality, can not watch the entire video. The manufacturer needs to review on quality, very poor and defective CD. Disappointment!"
1,south bronx heroes,"this dvd was returned because of such poor quality, it should not have been sold anywhere. thank you"
5,saving the best for last,"In honor of Twain, I'd like to redefine ""classic"": the older one gets, the better it gets. Thus with Horowitz's playing. When I was younger, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. There were the techically more proficient, and quite obviously,many more passionate. But, at the end of the day, none play as well as Horowitz - and never was the perfection of his playing and understanding more in evidence than on this last studio session, to which I still give an ear decades after I first heard it. Essential."
5,Great Album to have,"This is the first couple of classical music tapes/CDs I had. I have been listening to this album for more than 10 years, and I never felt tired of it."
5,The Man who lost China,"This is an excellent and well researched biography of Chiang Kai-Shek.It provides insights to a man who in many ways remains an enigma, but this book brings the reader to a much closer understandingof its subject and the politics and political culture that was and perhaps still exists in China.The Princelings of today seem to have learnt much from their Elders. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying to develop an understanding of Past and Future China."
4,A balanced look at the man who united China,"If you believe the Chicom stooges, Chiang Kai Shek deserves to be villified. Crozier balances both KMT and CCP sources to get a balanced look at the man who attempted to bring the Sun Yat Sen's democracy to fruition. Crozier traces Chiang's life from his boyhood in Chekiang to his death on Formosa. Chiang was vain, surrounded himself with corrupt yes-men, but he did care about China and would have united it had not his American allies sold him out. No matter what your assessment of the KMT, you cannot deny that given the results of the Cultural Revolution, that Chiang is the lesser of the two evils."
5,Great Book,If you are thinking about start a Virtual Assistant business this is a must read for everyone. It has all the tools you will need and then tells you where to go to have help and follow up.
5,"Virtual Assistant, The Series","I have not finished reading this book, but I highly recommend it. It has a step-by-step approach that is very helpful."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for VA's","I can't say enough about this book. Anytime I buy a book that I know Diana has had anything to do with, I know I will not be disappointed. As a VA who is just starting out, Diana's books have always provided me with all the information in one great resource. The book is easy to understand, without being overwhelming.I love the fact that in just about each section, she asks for the opinions of other VA's as far as what they went through with a certain situation. It is great to see the input they have to offer, which is also helpful when you are trying to make your own way in the business.Overall, I would definitely recommend Diana's book. Her book helps you to be well equipped to face the unknown challenges of the VA industry with confidence."
2,"Disappointing, simple information","Information is too simple. I found this book to be useless to my somewhat established business. Buy a NOLO or book specific to what you need (marketing, finance, etc.) Give this one a miss."
4,Virtual Assistant book review,"Very informative book. Has given a few great Ideas for me start as a Virtual Assistant.Virtual Assistant, The Series: Become a Highly Successful, Sought After VA (Virtual Assistant)"
2,Disappointing,"There is a lot of general business information in this book that you can find in just about any business-related, how-to book. You'll find the typical marketing advice, typical Web site advice, and typical advice on writing a buisness plan.The virtual-assistant Web sites listed in the ""You're Not Alone!"" section are mostly outdated, although I realize the author has no control over that.There is some useful information in the book, such as the sample marketing letter and the sections on choosing services and setting fees. There also is some useful advice from other virtual assistants. However, I'm not sure those things make the book worth its cost. It may be worth the cost for someone who is totally unfamiliar with business practices.Frankly, if you're interested in offering writing services through your virtual-assistant business, I would recommend reading the book titled ""The Wealthy Writer"" by Michael Meanwell."
3,"Not great, not too bad - half way to what I was looking for","I am a self-confessed small business book junky who recently decided to launch a VA business.The book itself has a nice heft and large format, though the content itself had a distinctly ""off the laser printer"" look that seemed homemade.I would have liked to see the authors dig a bit deeper into helping the reader find a sense of direction and reality as they enter this business. Some of the contributions made by working VAs were helpful, though I don't think there should be so many of them. Space would be better used on practical information.Good appendix!Donna"
2,Reproduction quality is poor.,"This review concerns the Kessinger Publishing's ""Legacy Reprints"" edition:Caesar: The Gallic WarThis edition is a reproduction (photocopy) of the Heinemann/Putnam 1919 edition. As such, it is very difficult to read (every page is a poor-quality photo reproduction with black text on a gray background - very low contrast, difficult to read for long).There are no maps included in this edition."
2,I should have read the negative reviews.,"In this book you will find poor photocopies of the original translation. No maps are included despite being advertised. At no point is it clearly stated that the book is a poor photocopy of the original printing. It has been nearly a hundred years since the original printing of this translation. It is pathetic to have just paid so much for such a poorly copied issue. If, for some reason, you have a mind not to pay a luxurious price for sloppy and effortless work then be warned. This edition is very poorly made."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MERCHANDISE,"I am very disappointed because I have never received this item, and I paid for it. I contacted the seller through Amazon and never heard back from them either. I will NEVER use this seller again!!!! I'm very upset with Amazon as well and hope to receive a credit for this purchase from SOMEONE."
2,Too promiscius - haven't they heard of AIDS?,"I really don't like the show at all, only bought this because a friend had it on his shopping list for Christmas. I'm soooo glad this show isn't typical of the male gender."
2,2 & 1/2 Men - Season 6,"I had enjoyed the show while it was on & now when I do not know what I want to watch, I bring out the DVD and watch some of my favorite shows."
4,Good,The quality of the DVD is good and the DVD was entertaining but not as good as previous seasons. Still good.
1,2 and a half men the 6th season,Ordered this on Dec. 3rd and still haven't received it. Tried to contact seller twice with no response. In the process of legal action.
2,By far the worse season,"I watched all the ""2 & half men"" seasons. I LOL from the 1st episode of the 1st season to the 7th one of the 6th season, after.......the DISASTER! Charlie is no more Charlie, his new fiancee Chelsey iper sucks and she is on scene all the time. Charlie has became a second Alan, he apologise often for his (brilliant)past, became a loser and there is nomore laughing. It is sad to accept but this show died! I'm so disappointed! Chuck: give us back the old Charlie or give up. PS Fire the new director and the new writer, they can't..."
1,Charlie Sheen makes me gag,"Charlie Sheen is too old and too much of a has-been to be acting the part of a playboy, and the kid is too old to be still be playing a kid. This show jumped the shark several seasons ago."
5,FANTASTIC,"This movie was so great-the first 2 minutes were a bit slow, but once it got going-even I was captivated-the story is very creative, funny, and also a tear jerker-even my kids cried over the sad scenes. I could not stop watching it-my kids absolutely loved it. The music (I am a big Phil Collins fan)was wonderful and I could not get the songs out of my head for 2 days even in my sleep. I completely recommend this for your kids!!!!"
5,Better Than Expected,"I am in college and I really enjoyed Brother Bear. It was cute, fun, sad, colorful, and actually quite moving. When this feature came out at the theaters I was not expecting much and didn't bother to see it. I rented the movie and just got so into it. The story between the friendship of Kenai and Koda is cute. Their evolution from acquaintances, to friends, to family is a good message for us all. The animation of the wilderness is beautiful (makes me appreciate 2D animation again). And, well, the movie was moving and a bit reminiscent to the Lion King and Bambi. I have to lastly saw that I loved the two mooses in the movie. They just cracked me up so much.Brother Bear is not the best Disney movie that I have ever seen. It is not in the ranks of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, but it is nowhere near Disney movies like Atlantis. It is a cute movie and I think adults will like it if they see it."
4,"Good story, se convirtio en oso para ser hombre","Good story, not too complicated so they could focus on quality of staging and funny moments. Excelent work of backgrounds with an especific tecnique (like lilo and stitch), and work of palettes. The first bear is impresively well animated. Efects of shoulder camera that makes more dramatic some scenes. Sings are boring as always, but what can I do, they dont understand that anybody likes the singing.Muy buena historia, no muy complicada asi se pueden enfocar en la calidad de las escenas y momentos graciosos. Excelente trabajo de fondos y paletas, con una tecnica definida como lo hicieron en Lilo y Stitch. Efectos de camara al hombro muy bien logrados. El primer oso esta animado de una forma impactantemente buena. Les da por cantar, como siempre, pero ni modo, no entienden que a nadie le gusta la cantadera y que se pierde el ritmo de la pelicula. Pero esta en general muy buena, divertiva y emotiva, se redimieron de El planeta del tesoro."
3,Ok,"This film came out to theaters November 1st...and my son and I saw it a little after that. While watching this film, the two of us thought that is definately was a cute film, and it had some of the Disney trademark on it, but it was not one of the better ones out there. I thought that the story overall was a bit boring. It was not real high action, and it was a bit too cutesy for my taste. It is not a bad film...but it surely is not the best ethier."
1,really bad political correctness...,"This looks puked on. even I voted for bush, unlike those losers who made this sh**ty movie! So tell me again, why did somebody make this. Ir is way too politically correct. It is ""Man is Evil"" like, it is environmentalist, it has the ""Great Spirits from above, and it has music which no one in the right mind will like, especially not love. Now anyone who likes this should have their Butts dropped off, and so should the makers."
1,unstatified ~ twice,"I'd like to return the two (2) DVD that were sent to me. Both received had a prompt that said not authorized to play in my region. (I am still awaiting to hear back what country so that the return address is complete & the P.O. will accept)I send these DVD movies to my grand daughter who lives w/her Spanish speaking grandparents, along w/young cousins. The seller wanted to send me a web link, if I recall correctly, that would instruct on how to get the DVD to play. If I was unable/unwilling to do so, I certainly wasn't going to inflict what should be a gift to kids.I still do not see that my account has been credited back. Regretfully, I feel sour about the experience.Mrs. B"
1,"once again,bad...","I know that the last 3 reviews have given you enough info on how the movie is but I just need to warn you once again...this movie has way too much political correctness,to the point where it's either laughable or boring,take your pick."
1,Didn't work on our Sony DVD player,"Maybe it was a good movie, maybe not, but it didn't play in our Sony DVD player. Maybe copy protection gone too far. Worked in the Apex DVD player in the bedroom, but we are returning it since the kids use the Sony DVD player in the family room. Hopefully they will fix this in the future."
1,don't bother,this movie is absolutely horrible. The plot is tired and the characters weak. Avoid this one....
1,remember back when conservatives controlled the media...,...now all the animated movies are like this.Liberal and just plain awful so much that not even a liberal himself would find it watchable.Even the newagers who obviously fueled its release would hate it.
1,Bearly credible,"This is a dreadful film. It's a cheap Bambi remake for the 40 somethings who cried the first time Mummy Dear got plugged, sneered the second time and then, finally on the third showing, cooed over their offspring when Thumper revealed the inner beauty of life.Similarly, this film is all about death, and America's continuing inability to come to terms with the 'big one'. Apparently we're to be comforted by the knowledge that dead relatives can always stroke our chin when we're at our lowest ebb and that Grandad is now an eel.To be fair, my five year old son was delighted by the cub and then thoroughly confused (but not upset) by the ending...why did his mummy come back from heaven and then leave him...again ? The answer, my son, is that there's nothing more callous than a dead mummy bear...except for a sicko Disney executive."
2,small,"The movie was a small screen the whole time, making watching the movie difficult. I wouldnt pay for this again."
4,Cute film,Hoping once kiddo's recent animal fear phase passes she will want to watch more of it. She adores bears but is currently terrified of them. It's a very sweet film (previewed it of course) and Disney has done a lovely job.
2,"Uninspired, Over-Schmaltzed With a Dash of New Age Goo","Brother Bear comes nowhere near the animation heights Disney achieved in the early to mid 90's. As story, it was tired and formulaic, as animation, it lacked visual energy and inventiveness. An eskimo folk tale serves as vehicle and inspiration for the film's new age ""we are at one with nature"" theme, but the overall feeling is closer to greeting card sentimentality."
4,Good movie but beware of the shut up,This was a good movie that we watched as a family. Good story however I was surprised how many times they said SHUT UP and even had brothers spitting on each other. I know it's brotherly behavior however not what I want my three year old learning. All in all I get it a 3-4 rating.
5,Brother Bear,Loved this movie. I get it out when the grandchildren are spending the night. One of the favorites. Would recommend.
4,Great movie!,Love this movie and so did my children when they were young. Now I have copies to share with my grandchildren.
5,Brotherly Love,"This was a great movie with an important message. My whole family loved it! Its geared towards older kids... i think it can be emotionally hard for smaller ones because like bambi and other classics before it, it deals with some hard issues. Still... it had great humor and a lesson for the young and old alike. Well done Disney!!"
4,Heartwarming and hilarious,"I just saved this to tape on my Tivo. It is probably one of the funniest movies! When I saw it in theaters, I was surprised when I saw that Sitka had the same voice as Aladar from Disney's Dinosaur! I didn't quite recognize the voice at first; I read the credits. Here are some of the funniest parts: after a stampede of caribu (which I thought were Megaloceras before) Kenai says, ""Never try to milk a caribu."" When Rutt and Tuke are riding a mammoth, Rutt wants to ""drive"". Tuke says, ""just relax and enjoy the ride!"" Rutt says, ""oh, okay,"" and spreads his legs out and says lazily, ""whee!"" Rutt and Tuke are walking in the mountains, and Rutt says, ""I can't believe you totalled a mammoth!"" In case you didn't catch it before, one of Rutt's antlers are broken in that scene."
5,Best Movie since the Lion King,"I saw Brother Bear on the day after it came out,and I was AMAZED. I've been waiting since mid-summer to hear and see more about this movie,and it was much better than I ever expected. I've drawn scene after scene of it,and I'm trying to get my hands on as much merchindise as possible! :)"
3,Becoming a Man,"The story takes place in an Indian Village many years ago. Keani attends a ceremony to receive his totem. The totem is a symbol of transition from boyhood to manhood. Keani's totem is a bear. He is told that the bear means love. Sidka is the oldest of the three brothers, and his totem is the eagle of guidance. Keani really isn't pleased with his totem.After his brother, Sidka, is killed, he throws his totem to the ground. From that point forward his life is transformed. I found that the movie was a little sad but poignant at the end. The Brother Bear games are enjoyable."
2,:(,"This movie was not good, and I found myself waiting for it to end. It was disturbing, and, well...boring. It's too boring for older kids, and too disturbing for little ones. And when I say disturbing, I mean just down right nasty! I can't believe Disney, of all companies, would produce something like this and call it a kid's movie! Buy something worth buying instead, like one of Disney's older animated movies, which were actually GOOD."
5,Brother Bear,I have 6 boys ranging in age from 3-19. We all loved this movie. It was a good family movie.
2,Disney pushes the envelope yet again...,"If you are a Christian - please do not waste your time on this movie. As a Christian mother I was warned that this movie was full of spirit worship and bought it for my 3 1/2 year old son anyway. Well, the spirt worship is one thing but the movie is just plain BORING on top of that. The moose use the word ""stupid"" to the point is not humorous and it teaches our children to use inappropriate language as well. I am sorry but Disney should be a name you can trust and when a movie is written for children such language and inuendo should not be present. Disney just pushes the envelope too far with some of their stuff and they seriously need their wrists slapped for some of it.Again, take out the religion and word ""stupid"". The movie is just dull and boring."
3,Ok if you can get past the greenie tree hugging,"Another kid's movie hiding a pagan world view with tons of greenie lectures.Ok, animals are cool and we should all live in harmony.Anyway, this is one I won't be in a hurry to watch again and can't recommend owning."
4,Disney gives us another winner!,"Once again, the folks at Disney gives us a story about life. This time, the storyline is about the Native American practice of Shamanism, or the importance of the connection to the deepest power of nature. Respecting life and all animals. This story may be too deep for most kids. But what they'll enjoy are the characters like the two moose, who turn out to be the voices of the Mackenzie Brothers from SCTV. Recommended!!"
4,Review for Brother Bear,"It feels like a project that got quietly pushed through the pipeline while the studio gears up for bigger and better things. The journey is diverting on a Saturday-morning kind of way, but it doesn't compare to say, Finding Nemo. It turns out to be a paradigmaticventure, illustrating both the virtues of hand-drawn films and why they have become an endangered species. Disney hides the morality tale behind a rip-roaring soundtrack, goofy moose sidekicks and enough bear slapstick to delight any child. This opulent movie, with gorgeous rainbow animation, is heavy on message but light on humor, though, I recommend seeing Brother Bear."
3,A good attempt,"This is a good attempt with a moving plot, but doesn't own up to even the weaker Disney films. it's unusual...but the songs are terrible, but is a good ""just-once"" film. The previews said it was in 'the spirit of THE LION KING' but it isn't"
2,some good; some bad,"The exposure to Eskimo culture was good (if accurate); the music and scenery were beautiful. However, we are discarding it because of the excessive use of ""shut up"" and other disrespectful talk. Movies are where our children pick up disrepectful language."
5,The Lion King of the 2000's,"Brother Bear is a very good family movie with alot of heart, soul, and humor. I am 17 years old and I like this movie as much as i like the lion king."
2,Mixed impression,"Brother Bear had positive aspects:1. The example of how brother bear came to care for Koda2. The animation and graphics were visually appealing3. Humorous moments with the two mooseNegative aspects:1. The scene where one brother tackles another and proceeds to spit on him. This scene was totally unnecessary. Our three year old started spitting on other people after seeing this movie. The last thing parents need is a movie teaching them bad behavior.2. It presents the killing of the mother bear as a bad thing, yet the bear seemed to bear no responsibility for being a factor in the death of Kenai's brother. Although Kenai started out tracking the bear as a result of his anger over his brother's death, in the end he killed the charging bear as matter of self defense.3. The scene where the two rams keep yelling ""Shut up!"". This scene also causes small children to repeat this phrase in an inappropriate way."
2,this is the story of how a boy became a man by becoming a bear.,"The title of my post is the concluding sentence to this movie (what does that even mean?). All I can say after wasting my $2.00 on this movie is ""What the heck?"" Bad Disney... very bad."
2,Disney by Numbers,"Take a little bit of Beauty and the Beast (Character transforms into beast following selfish act and must atone), take some of Pocahontas (basing the story around native ritual and magic), add a pinch of The Emperor's New Groove (a road trip with tension between the two leads that eventually results in friendship) and add a lot of The Lion King (comedy duo sidekicks, death in the family, the whole nature thing). Finally leave out all of the trademark Disney magic and you basically have the recipe for Brother Bear. Lets hope that Home on the Range is a little more original and entertaining."
2,Tereribly sad!,"This movie is probably good for very little kids who don't understand death, but for everyone else it is very sad. It's also not funny enough to be entertaining. It is way too long and there isn't enough going on to make little kids smile. I wouldn't reccommend unless your child is interested in death and boring movies!"
2,"""Not this Daddy! Not this!"", A disappointed Dad","""Not this Daddy! Not this!""That's the review my 3-year old son gave Brother Bear after about 15 minutes, not counting several minutes of previews we sat through before I gave up and fast forwarded through them.To be honest, I was a bit relieved. The animation was lush but unengaging, the narration was overly preachy, and the Phil Collins music was, well... Phil Collins music.It wasn't a total loss -- we spent the rest of the evening putting puzzles together and coloring."
3,tolerable,good for kids but my kids don't like it and we are not even going to attempt the second film. I got it dirt cheap and i know why it is not that good and i would not go out of my way to get it i just needed it for my collection and i don't like it much.
1,"Unfortunately, the magic has left the building.","Here's what I can say is good about the movie...the colors and the animation are pretty.Otherwise, it's simply boring. The music is uninspired. The dialogue is preachy.The changing of the aspect ratios 24 minutes into the film is gimmicky and lame, downright annoying in fact.Buy practically anything else made or distributed by Disney and you will be better off."
2,Good for Kids Only,"Movies like this is the reason why Disney as a company is doing so badly. It is not a bad movie, but the story is VERY predictable. This means that the only people who will enjoy this movie are very young kids. There are some really laugh out loud moments involving the mooses, and one scene with the newly transformed bear were reminisce of those old Disney shorts about the bears and the park ranger. Unfortunately, those were the only good things an adult will find amusing. Whether about 10 mins of laugh will make this a good movie for you is a matter of personal choice. I find the movie wanting. You know the movie is in trouble when there were SO many songs. There was simply not enough story to fill up the screen time. Of course, kids may like this, but if you are an adult, the only reason why you want to buy this DVD is that you have a bunch of rug monkeys that you want to distract with this movie."
3,Called England through a Local Dallas #,"It told me at the beginning of the phone call that I had over an hour of talk time. After 52 minutes, I had one minute left, which works out to 18.9 cents per minute. It took 45 minutes for the PIN to reach my hotmail email account."
4,Everything I was looking for in a watch,"An atomic watch was a must for me because I needed the accuracy. I also prefer a watch that is easy to use and keeps itself set. The solar recharging feature for the battery is a bonus. I rated this watch 4-stars instead of 5-stars only because of the small numbers on its face which aren't offset with enough contrast. (I'm nearing 50 and my eyesight for this kind of reading is marginal). Otherwise, awesome watch!"
3,Nice - for the short time before the battery died,"It's a nice watch and I like the solar concept. But the supposedly ""back-up"" battery died after only a few months. What's the point of the solar power if it's not enough to actually power the watch unless you're in direct sunlight almost all day long?Great if you work outside in a sunny place. Otherwise, a disappointment..."
2,disappointment,"I would love to wear this watch. When it works, it gives accurate time and the display is clean and nice. However, unless it is perched on my windowsill soaking up the rays, it quickly loses charge and dies. I received it as a gift and I don't really have time to figure out how to get it fixed, so I continue to wear my old watch. My new one sits looking out the window like a house cat. Very disappointing."
3,Not Thrilled,"All these watches are amazing. So, in the first place, it's a very competent watch. That said, I was a little disappointed. I have a GW300 (module 2608) that had one of the early batteries so notorious for failing. This (GW700) watch just seems to go in the wrong direction. It's not as good looking, as tasteful, whatever. The digits are harder to read. The layout of the display makes less sense. Now with time on my hands (no pun intended) and with nothing to lose, I ordered a battery for the GW300 and carefully changed it. Guess which one I'm wearing and guess which one is in the cupboard in standby mode? If I had it to do over again, I would simply look at the pictures of the many watches Casio offers and try to be more careful."
3,"Yummy garlic bagel chips, but....",Roses are redRain gives them a soakin'I wish the bagel chipscame to me less broken.
5,Betcha can't eat just one!,"These bagel crisps are great. They provide a slightly salty crunchy snack perfect for in-between classes or a short break on the job. Everyone I've shared them with loves them too. Nutritionally, they're ok: not the best, but far from the worst."
5,"So Far, So Good","I've had this for a few months and have enjoyed it. It looks good and the recipe dial is a cool feature. I'll use it for some of the drinks, but not all of them. It works well. I didn't have any problems getting it apart like some people. It's pretty heavy, but that's probably a good thing! Unless you have nice, tall cabinets, it will be too tall to store without laying it on its side, because it's quite large. That's probably the only negative I have for it."
4,21 year old loves it!,Purchased this for a new 21 year old. It comes in handy for her favorite drinks within reason. Seems durable and the recipes are pretty good.
2,Received a defective unit,"I was originally going to give this a three star review because of the following positives and negatives:Pros- Sturdy construction, modern and nice appearance, and easy to use (in theory)Con (a big one)- I received a defective unit. No matter what we tried, we could not get the cap off the strainer. This is coming from a man in his 30s with average strength. The cap is incredibly tight. In fact when we pulled on it, the metal sheath pulled off and left a black plastic cap. Hence, no straining capability.What dropped the review to two stars was the non-existent customer support. I e-mailed them twice about this and it was like a black hole. Luckily, Amazon's customer service is much better and I returned it for a refund."
1,Poor Construction,"The words do not line up with the holes. The outside turning part to pick your drink it completely worthless as I can't read half of the stuff. The novelty wore off as soon as I saw that I'd have to take the inner core out of the sleeve to be able to read any of the drinks. Not even worth my time in returning it. Works great as a regular shaker though, but if that's what you want, just buy a regular shaker and don't spend your money here."
2,Recipes don't line up with the outer sheath,"Great size shaker. Solid construction. I received one of these as a gift, and noticed the recipes don't line up completely with the openings on the outer sheath. No problem, returned it, got another. Same issue. The tops of every ingredient are cut off because of the way it is printed. Makes the recipe portion kind of useless, if you don't know the amounts."
2,"Nice to look at, just can't use it....","It took me nearly 10 minutes to pull the shaker open, (I finally had to bang it on the side of my kitchen sink to loosen it) but I STILL can't get the lid on top off. It was also very hard to ""dial"" and sticks when you turn it. Maybe after a few uses (if we can ever get the lid off!) it will loosen up, was going to buy these as Swag Gifts for a Girls' Night Out event but will try a different brand instead."
1,"Dial Stuck, Recipes Illegible",I received this item at my work shipping/receiving dept. and the guy who I picked it up from was concerned that the package had been damaged because he heard a loud rattling noise coming from the box. I opened the packaging that looked like it was thrown together in a hurry to find out the small cap was tossed inside the main body with no wrapping around it.That really didn't bother me but then I discovered that the dial was completely stuck. It was impossible to move defeating the main purpose of me buying this type of shaker. The second flaw was that the text for the recipes were smudged in several spots to the point of illegibility.I can only assume that this was grabbed from the stock room after someone else returned it and shipped out to me in this damaged condition.Completely Dissatisfied
3,"Ok shaker, the recipe twister is worst than useless","The shaker is a shaker, it's large and can mix 2-3 drinks at a time. The recipe selector is worst than useless, but thankfully it can be easily taken off."
2,QUESTION.PLEASE ANSWER,"Ok...so this isnt a review,but a question I have on this product. Where is the instruction manual to this thing? What do the lines above the alcohol names mean. There are two, three, even four lines above some of the alcohol names. Does it mean the amount of alcohol that is supposed to be put into that particular drink. Please answer...for it has left many of us flustered. thank you very much"
4,Make better drinks,"This shaker is extremely useful in a variety of scenarios. The after-work, wind-down cocktail. The pre-party, warm-up drink. The after-dinner drink. Even the weekend-long bender (just kidding of course).The dial is easy to twist and turn and the drink recipes are easy to read. Even over time and repeated use. The built-in strainer can't be beat if you've got citrus and ice in the mix. The drink recipes run the gamut from the standard (martini) to the weird (the aforementioned between the sheets). Heck, it even works for drinks whose recipes aren't on the side of the shaker.My only buying advice would be to buy two of these. Depending on your thirst, frame of mind or company this'll only do for two drinks at a time. For the party person in you, you'll want to be more flexible with your drink mixing."
4,fun and useful,"Even though we rarely use the ""dial-a-drink"" feature, it's a fun item and works quite well no matter what you're mixing. (Lately I've been using it to whip cream for tiramisu. <g>) My only complaint is that it takes me forever to get the lid off, but maybe I'm just a wimp. I agree that it's big enough to mix three drinks at a whack, and the stainless steel seems to be of decent quality."
1,Hard to open!,"This shaker is impossible to open. From the time we brought it home, I had such a hard time getting the lid off. When I finally did, I couldn't get the lid to the pour spout off. Even my husband had a difficult time. Very frustrating. Save your money!"
1,I've given up,"Despite this being a wedding gift from my brother, I've given up on it. It has become nearly impossible to open! Several people have spilled drinks trying to pry it open. I like it, but it simply doesn't work, and it makes you look like a fool when guests are waiting for their drinks."
2,There's a reason they don't show you any of the inside in the preview,"In my opinion, buying this version of this sheet music was a waste of time and money. When I tried to open it with Kindle, I found that the font size was extremely small and pixelated, making it very hard to read. Aside from this, you cannot zoom to see the text or notes any closer. Granted, it's a fairly cheap version of the sheet music for this song, but I still don't think its worth the price if you want to use it to read the text of the song or even play it on any sort of instrument. I would look for a higher quality version of this piece or one that at least shows you a sample of the actual sheet music."
5,What I wanted,"It was as it was advertised. I got it for my father when another, more expensive, gift was not going to get here in time for Christmas. It arrived within a week of ordering it and my father seemed genuinely pleased."
4,"Weird, but it works","This looks like an internal IDE that was put in a plastic box, with some conversion hardware that turns it into external USB. Maybe they're all like that - this is the only one I've ever bought. Makes you want to take it out of the plastic box and install it as an internal drive....The drive has worked great. I used it to back up my crucial data just days before my old hard drive crashed. Only four stars because, 1) the plastic box/cd drive are hard to get back together, after you take them apart, and, 2) the Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4 software that came with it, hangs under certain circumstances, when you're backing up data. I've personally never seen any 5-star burner software, but I haven't worked with CD burners a whole lot."
2,"Better than nothing, but there must be something better","It seems odd that this CD-RW drive is still on the market, as it is rather slow for today's demands. The Adaptec software that shipped with my drive had some sort of conflict, which made it impossible to record music. Fortunately, Pacific Digital customer service worked with me and got me NTI CD-Maker, which worked well enough for burning CDs but not as well for printing labels. Once everything is up and running, putting together a disk is fairly straightforward, albeit time consuming for music CDs. The end result is great: your own music mix on CD or a handy way to backup data files and photos off of your hard drive. I was thrilled to get this drive a few years ago. Now I think I would look for something with more bang for the buck."
1,"Good music, evil copy protection","I like the music on this CD very much, but cannot play it on my laptop or any other computer. It contains MediaMax ""copy protection"" software from 2004, a program that's notorious for making computers vulnerable to security problems, and is just generally evil (a quick web search will tell you why). If you want to listen to these songs on a computer or any Ipod-type device, you're better off buying them from a site that sells music downloads-- don't buy the CD. I wish I hadn't."
5,Royal Purple Well Worth The Money,"This oil is much more pricey than regular oil, but it really is well worth it.We use all of the Royal Purple products in our Tahoe, Snowmobile, 4wheeler, and Dirtbike.Sorry its not so detailed like the other reviewers, but its great stuff!"
1,Save your money,"I got sold the hype to and bought enough RP for 4 oil changes in my 2006 Lincoln Town Car. There was absolutely no difference in gas mileage and what may be perceived as a boost in horsepower is the fact the RP is a racing oil that was never intended for daily use according to my mechanic who works on some of the most exotic cars ever built. So because I was foolish enough to switch from Mobil 1 to RP mu motor now has internal noises and a clatter that was never present before. That has now improved since switching back to Mobil 1 but don't by this garbage unless you're doing some competitive racing. There is may excel but I would never put this in any daily driver. And BTW..., I haven't spoken to a single mechanic who endorses this oil, STAY AWAY FROM IT!"
5,Excellent Synthetic Oil,"I used this oil and the matching royal purple filter for the first two oil changes on my brand new 2012 Ford Fusion Sport AWD. I shortened the first two intervals to about 4,000 miles to get the initial break in materials out of the engine and then had each oil sample analyzed by Blackstone Laboratories. The Results were perfect! The oil had tons of life left in it and could have definitely met\surpassed the factory 10,000 mile recommendation while providing my engine with maximum protection."
5,Best oil for the money!,"I've always liked Royal purple. It just last longer compared to other synthetic oils, making it cheaper in the long run. I get around 15-18K between oil changes in my Expedition. I do swap out the K&N; oil filter every 6k or so miles. I do so an increase in Highway mpg with the Royal purple vs what the Ford comes with.In my other two 4 banger cars, I don't see any MPG improvements, but the once a year oil changes are great."
1,Don't buy these shoes unless you want blisters,I bought these shoes and after wearing them for 20 minutes I had blisters the size of quarters on my heels and toes.
1,junk,don't buy. these are cheap batteries. get what u pay for. they don't last long at all. i stick with duracell now
3,Not for digital cameras,"These batteries are fine for toys, remote controls, etc, but not for battery eaters like digital cameras. I guess they just don't have high capacity although they are called ""high performance"". I used to use these in my Canon A510, and 2 batteries would be gone in like 2 hours! It is a big hassle to keep changing batteries, especially when you are travelling. I blamed my camera at first, but when I tried a pair of 2500mah rechargables, I know the difference - The battery life is at least 2-3 times longer!"
5,Amazing deal!,"Unbelievable price for a package of 50 high-quality AA batteries! Bought two....they're good until 2010, so I should be in good shape."
2,Memorex Batteries,"I was disappointed. These were not the Memorex Batteries I usually see, these are made in China and look like knock offs.I haven't used them yet, so they may be O.K., expecially at that price, but I feel like I was missled.I also found I could buy Batteries at Costco for the same price."
5,"""Excellent, enjoyable and well written, overall smashing""","This book was like a box of chocolates, so many great and spiffy stories to read and I didn't know which to choose. I advise anybody with free time and an intrest in teenagers or just an intrest in finding out about the meaning of adolesence to read this great book!"
5,Important read for parents,"I found this book to be very interesting and easy to read and recommend it to other parents. Dr. Ponton uses colorful examples from her work with teens to explain the motivations behind some of the dangerous and not so dangerous things our kids do. Moreover, she makes the important argument that teenage risk taking is a normal part of development in our culture. I felt like I was in better shape to relate to and understand my teenager after reading the book. Her other book on adolescent sexuality is also good."
5,whoever doesn't like this isn't a metal fan,"this is the powermetal album the albums one reviewer named kreator pleasure to kill,destruction sentence of death infernal overkil were german death metal this is power metal, this album is unbelieveable great stuff i listen to it to skateboard along with voivod's war and pain and many other albums. This was a masterpeice kai hansen is talent so is the rest of the band i prefer this band over iron maiden anyday incredible whoever doesn't like this is a poser plain and simple also get keeper of the seven keys part 1get this you won't be dissapointed way better than bands like running wild,grave digger ,iron maiden etc. all though i am a fan of them allp.s God Bless and get helloween to get back kai hansen"
3,Wide F*cking Open,"Originally released as a 9 song LP, this version of Walls of Jericho includes the 5 song mini EP and the Judas single. All in all a pretty good bang for the buck. This is probably the fastest album Helloween ever did, and Walls rivaled anything from the day--including releases from Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, Venom, and (dare I say) Slayer. Walls of Jericho is definitely balls out metal. Lots of double bass and twin guitar work. The bad thing is, all of the songs (except Gorgar) sound the same. There really is no variety in tempo between each song. In addition, I don't particularly care for Kai Hansen's vocals on this album, as he was Helloween's original singer. Nonetheless, Starlight, Victim of Fate, and Heavy Metal (Is The Law) are cool songs. Also, $10 for the mini EP, the album, and the Judas single all wrapped together is a good deal. Check it out--this is the birth of Helloween."
5,crimially underrated german thrash!,"i picked this up on casset in 86-87 this was mind blowing not the fastest or heavest but very hard and pure metal.at the time i thought america was the only place thrash/speed metal grew from but then i heard helloween,kreator,celtic frost and then coronor.these were some of the best, many liked sodom and artillery very good but not my style really but helloween had a fury at this time that american kids could relate to until the keepers of the 7 keys cds which are great euro power metal maiden style cd but this cd esspecially this 2 cds set will live in my heart as top knotch german thrash metal greatest song(timelessly relavant today)!"
1,complete waist of time and money,I spent 3 hours trying to install this product on my Toshiba laptop. Finally gave up and decided to send it back... I find MP3 players are still too new and have lots of bugs to be worked out. So for now I am planning to buy a CD burner and use my trustee CD player instead. Save your time and money.
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"Words cannot describe the frustration I have right now after trying for six hours to get this thing hooked up to my computer. I was on the phone with one of their tech reps for over an hour as well, and he finally gave up. It's a problem with the drivers... I cannot believe that any company in America could put out such a shoddy product with such weak documentation... (The rep, though he couldn't help me, did try, so they'll get a small point for that. But don't waste your time, buy something good..."
1,Surprising poor quality...even for the money,"I'll keep this short - this product is terrible. This was my first foray into a portable, and I went with the Rio name because I recognized it as one of a few industry leaders. I was mistaken. This product simply did not work - and I even exchanged it for another...and that didn't work either. The software was shoddy and inconsistent, - and when I did get it to work for a day it had unbelievably poor sound quality (a la the hissing you hear in the background that other reviewers have mentioned). Bottom line - this is a poorly designed and manufactured product, with incredibly bad website and customer support. Buy something else - like the Nomad IIc - it actually works and you'll be up and running in literally minutes."
2,Very Bad Sound Quality,"I thought that all those reviews talking about humming could not be true. I mean, this is a very well known player.However as soon as I started using it I discovered that was true. The humming is very annoying. The sound scale of this RIO is from 1 to 20, and unless the volume is higher than 8 you will hear that noise.I hope the Nomad is better than this. I'll return mine and get the Nomad."
3,Good....but save up and get better,"Well I bought this MP3 player as my first one. I have to say it as REALLY good sound from what I have heard (at 128 or above), great battery life (but I think the 10 hours is pushing it) and I'm happy it can support my WMA files.But this is where the good stuff falls short. You only get the song number so you don't really know which song you are selecting. Also it takes so long to go through songs, you better put only your best songs on there. DO NOT LISTEN TO WMA FILES ON THIS PRODUCT. Although it may support it no matter what the quality, I get a wierd fuzzing in the background EVERYTIME (which seems to be gone on my computer).If you are going to buy this as your first MP3 player (or a spare one for one of the members of the family) then do it. But if you are looking for anything above MP3's and maybe some bells and whistles, look somewhere else."
2,hum is very distracting,"As mentioned here (reference to ungrounded phone is very accurate), the humming noise really distracts what might be a good beginner mp3 player. Sound quality(above the hum) is fairly good and although not feature laden with an inexpensive 128MB smart media card, you can have a 160M player much cheaper then 128MB products. I got this free after rebate with a windows XP promotion but I would not buy it for any price. The humming is that bad and the manufacturer must be fully aware of it and it is totally unacceptable. Funny thing is from reading reviews from CNET, the people love this player but I don't understand why they're not hearing what we're hearing."
1,WILL NOT WORK WITH XP,"I got a RIO ONE Free with the purchase of WIN XP only to discover that they are incompatible. There is no driver for XP, and after sending three e-mails to technical support at sonic blue, I still have not received a response. Now I know why it was free :-("
2,Dissipointed,"I also recieved the Rio one free along with Windows XP, it worked great untill 3 hours later I loaded XP, and well I should have thought ahead cause now its just a christmas present for some else who hasn't upgraded there computer yet. I've emailed support too many times to count, but all they say is to either downgrade my operating system(which isn't possible with XP so they obviously don't know what the're talking about), or to try taking the battery out and trying again(its a software problem though, not a physical problem). If you're going to get a computer loaded with XP, stay away from this player."
1,"Flashing ""USB"" -- the saga continues (SONICBLUE SUCKS)","I, too, was lured by the low price and expandibility of this item. However, like the electronics fan from Connecticut, I had to buy a second unit. Now, the second unit is flashing ""USB"". It's as if the internal memory card needs to be reprogrammed or re-initialized. Unfortunately, SONICBLUE's CUSTOMER SUPPORT (...)!!!! Who wants to wait 20+ minutes on a long-distance call? Their online support (...) as well.Basically, their poor service is great advertising for Creative Labs, as I will probably order their Nomad IIC.I learn another lesson with this product--You get what you pay for."
1,Don't bother with this...save and get a better one!,"My RIO came without the firmware that runs the display... So I was never able to use it. I tried reaching Tech Support for a week by e-mail and then started the trek through SonicBlue's labyrinth of phone options. After running in circles and never actually reaching a human or a voice mail and always being refered to another toll number, I decided tell you all about it.If you haven't already figured it out my opinion of the player is poor and the company is yet even poorer.Good luck and Happy Holidays!"
1,Useless.,"I bought the Rio One because I had another MP3 player (one fromCompaq) and I didn't like that the other player used the MMCcards which have smaller capacity. The Rio One was a gift fora relative and I wanted to buy them something better than whatI had.That was a huge mistake. My Compaq MP3 player has never, notonce, given me problems. The Rio One player is currently brokenwith the flashing ""USB"" message others have written about. Now Ifeel really bad because I bought this person an MP3 player whichis far worse than mine. And as others have said, tech support?What tech support?"
1,Poor quality and a lot of trouble,"I am on my third one, the first two having been replaced under warranty. The first one would not play the selections that were stored on external memory. The second one had a very annoying background hum and the third one has that same hum but it isn't as noticeable. If you but one I would recommend that you first listen to it with a good pair of headphones with the volume set to minimum or you also purchase a really cheap pair of ear buds so that you get plenty of outside noise."
1,"Flimsy, and DOA!","The first thing I noticed when I pulled the Rio One from the blister pack (no easy feat in and of itself!) was how light and flimsy it felt. A strong wind (maybe) or a drop on concrete (definitely) would be the end of this device.The second thing I noticed was that it does not support Windows XP.Most importantly, however, was the third thing: it was dead on arrival. No display, no USB communication, no nothing. Changed batteries, pressed all the buttons, read the manual (!)... no luck. And reading other reviews, it sounds like I wasn't the only one with this experience.Bottom line: Get something else. This one's a stinker."
2,A Disappointment,"I got my Rio One for free during a promotion... when I purchased Windows XP. If it hadn't been free, I would have returned it. I have since added a 128MB flash memory card .Pros: Lightweight and small; easy to use; sound quality is more than acceptableCons: The display - it is absolutely worthless (I currently have 24 songs on my Rio One and by the time I memorize which song is where, I'm ready to swap them out anyway); The Rio One always starts on song 1 which is really annoying since I listen to mine in the car so several short trips results in me starting with the same song (one solution - front load your favorite songs); Skipping ahead or back is slightly yet irritatingly delayed - no where near as fast as my Rio 500 (a product I recommend highly - if you can find it); the buzzing sound from the unit when playing songs at a low volume level (but since I'm normally in my car its not nearly as annoying as it would be if I used it at home more often); it doesn't have a backlight"
1,Where did the external memory go?,"I disliked more than less of the Rio One. Extended memory has stopped working although I've reloaded the flash many times and gone through the www drill of locating potential answers. Instruction book is over simplistic and not addressing potential problems very well. Help desk is past my waiting time. Good Concept, would not recommend it to anyone. P.S. ""Cash back"" voucher was returned after 3 months stating ""bill"" was not submitted. Not! Amazon.Com should regulate companies like this or at least stop selling defective products."
5,"Great player, execllent sound, low price","This is the best MP3 player I ever heard! This player sounds great, has roomy storage space, and has fast transfer time from computer to the Rio One. The only problem I had was that I at first could not get the Rio software to work right until I downloaded a updated .dll file from their website, but from there on everything went smoothly. For the low price, great sound and quality, and ease of use, I give this 5 stars."
2,Mine just died (it is the third time),I bought one when it first came out and it never worked right. Since it was under warranty they sent me a new (refurbished) one and it had the same problem. Then after a two month battle they sent me out a brand new one and it worked great for about a year but then it just died. Actually it isn't totally dead but all it does is blink the amount of memory it has until the battery runs down. I can't turn it off or play any thing.So the support people do the best they can but I don't think the player is designed very well.
1,"Worked for a while, then completely died","I bought this product , because it was my first mp3 player, and I wanted an inexpensive one. It worked fine for about a year, then one time when the batteries ran out, it just stopped working, and complety died. Now, with better models with more memory and durbility on the market, I'd skip over this one."
2,nervous wreck it'll break again...,"I bought the RIO ONE 32mb for my son for Christmas 2001. It stopped working about 2 weeks later. We had to download new firmware. Then about 3 weeks after that it died completely. We did nothing for months because the store we bought it from said ""too bad, call the manufacturer."" Then in Nov. 2002 I decided not to throw away a hundred bucks and I sat on hold for about 45 minutes until a tech answered the phone. It was pretty easy after that, I guess there are a lot of problems with these things. They gave me instructions to return it for a replacement, which I did and about 2 months later a new remanufactured one arrived. We still had to download something for it but we have had no problems since (6 weeks or so now). Wish us luck."
2,Very Bad Customer Service,"The product it's self is great. Very easy to use and great sound, but linking to the PC for downloads was not user friendly. The Mfg really failed here. Called customer service (no 800 number) and found the service to be very elementary. Their solutions so far were 1)""don't use the software that came with the unit, it doesn't work"" 2)""we've never seen anything like that, could you email it to us and we'll look into it?"""
3,Good Basic MP3 Player,"All things considered this is nice basic MP3 player.It is relativley inexpensive, easy to use and light weight.It is not perfect. It looks and feels like it was cheaply made. I am afraid if I drop it that will be the end of it.Sound Quality is not so good. Not even close to cd quality. Sounds more like a cheap walkman cassete player.But the low cost and portability of the unit make it perfect for working out or listening on the beach."
3,Solution for Flashing USB,"I, too, had the flashing USB thing happen to me the day I bought my Rio One. After many many hours of searching the net and Sonic Bleu's website, I found that I needed to reinstall their firmware (which I somehow found through their obscure FTP site)."
2,Lacking,"I got this unit to replace my Rio 500 that got lost in a car crash. I was disappointed with it as soon as I got it.First, there is a constant buzzing sound at low volumes that makes everything sound muddled.Second the display is awful. A cheap calculator has a better display.Third it decides to shut off right in the middle of a song for no good reason about every 15 minutes.I thought it would be a really good deal considering I could buy it and a 128mb smart media card totaling 160mb for quite a bit less then the Intel Pocket Concert(which only has 128mb). But the disappointing performance forced me to return it.After more in depth research, I found that the Creative Nomad IIc offers everything the Rio One does, plus a far superior display, backlighting, voice recording, etc. at the same price!"
1,"Bad Product, Worse Tech Support!","I purchased this product. It worked great for 2 weeks then started flashing USB. Nothing would play and unit would not even turn off! I have been talking with tech support for 2 months now, they gave me horrible directions for fixing it, it only make the problem worse and/or corrupted some files on my PC so that I had to delete/reinstall everything (I am A+ Computer Certified, so yes, I know what I'm doing). Each email to tech support takes at least 5-7 days to respond. My unit was sent back over a month ago and I still do not have a replacement (They make you pay for shipping charges for the new unit as well!) I would not recommend this product based on other reviews as well as my own experiences with their tech support. One plus, the included headphones have a great sound to them."
3,Things you should know before you buy,"1) MP3's are only as good as you! Don't complain about the quailty of the mp3 player when the odds are your mp3's aren't of a high quality, or were ripped by someone other then you. If you play songs at a high bit rate then this player sounds fine.2) 32mbs is not enough for decent quality music. 128kbps will give you a little less then 32 mins of music, buy more cards, because they are very cheap, and you can listen to more music then a cd player will give, and HIGHER QUALITY TOO!3) This is a beginners mp3 player, or a very frugal persons mp3 player. If you know how to rip, edit formats, and enjoy music of high quality, get a more expensive player.4) THERE IS NO BASS BOOST, if you are used to that on other players, you well be dissapointed with this. Also there is no text display of the ID tags on the player either.5) Battery life goes pretty fast, but it only takes on AA.I like it cause its cheap, expandable memory is cheap."
3,"good sound, bad display","I just purchased this at a local electronics store. A great price after the rebate but I am returning it because the LCD display is pretty much useless. An MP3 player should show the title of a song and artist (it's the whole point of having MP3 after the compression capabilities), this one just list the track number. So I guess you have to memorize the song title to it's corresponding number.The sound is actually good. THis is my second MP3 player and it beats my D-Link in sound quality. The RIO one is cheaply made, the D-Link is sturdier. I would keep if the LCD display provider more info."
3,It is not the worst.,"Granted it is not the top of the line mp3 player, but for the money, (...) it is all right.As for not working with Windows XP, if you follow the instructions in the booklet, NOT the on-screen instructions, the player works fine. If you are having a problem, uninstall Real Jukebox, delete any reference to it in the device manager (unknown device, etc.), unplug the player from the usb drive, restart the computer, re-load the Real Jukebox, ignore the part where they say to plug in your player on the on-screen instructions. After completing the Real Jukebox install, reboot, and when you are back to the desktop, re-plug the player to the computer and Windows XP will find it and install it. I made the same mistake and talked to the tech support, which did not know the correct answer to the problem, so yes they are useless.For the price of the player and some cheap flash cards you can have an unlimited sized player, and have hours and hours of music."
1,Chick Science,"It was a so-so book. Lots of interesting facts written in an almost chick-lit style. It was a bit like Becky Bloomwood writing a Steven Pinker review, but the jokes didn't work. ""Shopaholic & Brain"". You want the real thing? Go buy Steven Pinker, he can be smart too, but his humor is more elegant, his writing much better and you will learn tons more in a more objective way. Fine attempts to shock you, by showing how easily we can be fooled by our unconscious, is a like watching FOX news.You want to laugh? Go buy a Sophie Kinsella book, she is funny!The book could be a good introductory reading for people interested in neuroscience, but, nah, if you are really interested you better spend your money in a real author."
5,Funny and illuminating,"This is an excellent book. It brings together a wealth of academic research into the way our brains work and, in particular, how we can't rely on them, and I found this fascinating and in the case of some chapters genuinely helpful and illuminating. What sets the book apart is the fact that this material is presented so clearly and readably - and it's often very funny - but that doesn't mean it's simplistic. The last reviewer said it was suitable for 12 year olds but the fact that it is easy to understand doesn't make it any less insightful.This book was strongly recommended to me by a friend and I'm very glad I have now read it. I in turn recommended it to a friend who is an eminent psychiatrist, and in fact he'd already read it and thought it was very good too. So it works for a top brain-doctor and for a complete layman like me. Exceptional."
4,Easy and informative read.,"This book brings you up to date on how your brain is programmed to deceive you. Don't worry about having to wade through a lot of Freudian BS; it describes a lot of fascinating research, with each chapter dealing with a particular aspect of self delusion.When it came I was surprised to see the large font and small pages. It is not a massive tome by any means. But it is quite enjoyable and told with an engaging wit.I was on the verge of giving it 5 stars but it was just a little to thin to get that ranking. Still, go ahead and purchase this book. You'll enjoy."
3,a mind of its own,"The information is interesting and the research seems sound, when you get to it. The writing style is much too casual and detracts from the subject matter. Ms. Fine's personal life is of no interest to me. I find pages of what appears to be not much more than journal entries in a book I purchased for research material.Thank-you,Diana Jacobs"
4,We bought together with the bonmusica shoulder rest,"We like this item, my son love it. After 4 years of unsuccessfully trying to fix my son posture, finally the violin teacher suggested that we change the shoulder rest and the chin rest.Honestly, the difference is so obvious, my son is holding is violin better and he is not complaining of any sshoulder or back pain anymore.We glad, we did the purchase.New orleans, LA"
1,Item does not fit product,Unfortunately the item and description WILL NOT fit TJ Jeeps without welding on new screw holes to fit the holes on the headlight of your jeep.
4,like it,we havent tried the coffee yet or the tea but the packaging was attractive. I thought that it would have been a little larger but for the price it was a good value
1,Very Pretty but the clasp isn't that secure,"I love this bracelet, it is very pretty, but the clasp is not great, Easy to trip it up and it becomes unhinged and it left and i can't find it even after a month. : ( I don't think Amazon would replace it either. So it's just gone."
2,"good tent - FOR THE BACKYARD! otherwise, forget it","This tent is very big and heavy, not suitable for anything but car or backyard campingPLUS, WORSE:IT RIPPED TO SHREDS, POLES BROKEN< the first time wind got over 12 miles an hourthis is a very mediocre tent, we returned it for a refundit has a lot of room but it just isnt very strong or portable"
4,easy to pack,"The tent is very compact when it is packed and can be assembled by one person. The interrior room is great. I am 6 ft and can stand in the middle of the tent. The extra pockets, windows and accesories are all good. it can fit 4 adults and a couple of bags. I can fit a queen blow-up matress in it real easy.The bad: very hard to clean if you get stuck in the rain...but I guess they all are. also, depending on the heaviness of rain, you may have to get something additional for the top. I have had it leak a little under heavy rain."
5,""" The Hilton ""","I purchased this tent relying completely on the reviews of previous buyers. I am happy to say I was not disappointed and I think it lives up to all five stars!Setting up the tent even in the dark was simple when following the directions and 2 or 3 people can do this quickly.Due to certain reviews I took the advice to use sealant on the seam with the tag in case of rain and during a night of rain we were able to test this. Not one person felt wet!The size of the tent is generous 3 or 4 people with a sizable amount of gear would be comfortable. If you are using it solely for sleep without gear my friends and I were able to fit 6 snugly but still comfortably for a couple nights.We found it easily ventilated, bright, and spacious with standing room. I am proud to say I am now the proud owner of what my friends refer to as "" The Hilton "". The next camping trip is in the works!"
2,Cheap and falling apart,"I bought this tent last year and only used it once. I am diligent about drying the tent before restoring it. This year, we were pumped to get out on our first camping trip and all the line in the poles had frayed and broke. It was very hard to set up the tent as the poles simply kept coming apart. I was not a happy camper at all. Ultimately we got it up and it was fine. The rain fly was an issue too.It rained on us all weekend. Rain kept catching at the entrance so any time I went in and out the tent, the rain collection on top dumped on my back. We had a few leaks too as the rainflap touched the tent in a few places.So I am debating, order replacement poles or call it a waste and move on to something else. Really makes me mad. You'd think a ""Columbia"" brand tent would be good. Plus I was suckered by the 5 star reviews."
3,ok tent,Nice construction a little cold due to the fact you can't close the inside of the tent. The back wall is all screen great in the sun but cold air flows in at night with a draft mover your head. other than that it keeps you dry!! grat bag for storage plenty of straps
3,Leaky tent,This tent was easy to setup and it is an excellent size but it leaks at the seem under the back window
4,High country,When I ordered this tent I was needing a tent for 3 people to hunt out of. After I set it up I was extremely disappointed with how small it actually was. I put a cot in it and there was not much room left for anyone else. This tent went up very well. One very frustrating thing was every time you came out the front door you hit the rainfly pole and knocked it down. I believe you could comfortably put two people camping in this tent for more than one day. Three people if you had to.
3,Leaky,"This tent has a lot of nice features:-Set up is easy.-Over 6' tall ...great clearance!-Lots of windows for ventilation.-Skylight.This tent has one bad feature:-Leaks from window seam.We experienced light rain for about six hours. The tent had a large puddle in the center (where the lowest point was), causing our sleeping bags to absorb al lot of the water. This is unacceptable.I was going to exchange for a new one until I saw another reviewer experience the same issue."
5,I am really tickled with this tent!,"My husband & I are really impressed with this Columbia Bugaboo! We did not set it up at home prior to taking it camping (I know we should have but ran out of time...yikes, that's asking for trouble)! But, we had no problems whatsoever getting it set up. And in jig time! Plenty of room for the both of us and all our stuff! I love the gear loft. I love the cup holders (great for waters). I love the side air vents (great concept). And I LOVE the tiny remote control nite lite! Not real powerful but just enough to see yourself to bed when the other (me) is already sleeping! The front door mat is kind of a joke...but we have our own dirt catcher mat, so no matter. All in all we would highly recommend! In fact, my best friend (and camping buddy) went on Amazon and ordered one for herself today! So thanks Columbia & Amazon! I'm sure we'll get many years of use out of our Bugaboo!"
4,Nice Tent - short Review,"I have only used this tent twice: One practice backyard setup and one overnight campout. The tent was not difficult to set up. First time, including reading the instructions about 30 minutes, second time 15 minutes, winging it.All zippers worked smoothly. All parts fit flawlessly. Sizewise I took up about 1/3 of the floorspace with a queen-size inflatable mattress my son used about 1/4 so there was some room to stnd up and walk in the tent. A third person would have been doable but slightly cramped.Overall very satisfied with purchase!"
2,JUST OLD AND PREDICTABLE,"THIS TIME, JOHN WAYNE PLAYS A RODEO STAR WHO, ALONG WITH HIS FRIEND, GETS FRAMED FOR MURDER AND MUST CLEAR HIM AND HIS FRIEND'S NAME. WELL, THE MEDIOCRITY OF THIS WESTERN CAN'T BE BLAMED ON THE ACTORS, IT CAN HOWEVER, BE BLAMED ON THE STUDIO THAT MADE IT. LONE STAR PRODUCTIONS REALLY MUST'VE BEEN A HORRIBLE STUDIO TO WORK FOR, BEING THAT ALMOST EVERY JOHN WAYNE MOVIE THAT WAS MADE BY THEM ARE PREDICTABLE AND REPETITIVE. BUT, IF YOU LIKE JOHN WAYNE, YOU CAN'T GO ALL THAT WRONG."
3,Fretless AZM - Distant Earth,"The prolific Fretless AZM delivers Distant Earth, another album of electronic frippery and jazziness. The jazz is much looser on this album than on previous ones: ""Manipulation (Is Suspected)"" exemplifies this spirit, and ""Jam Sandwich"" is pretty much self-explanatory. ""Brass Lines & Basses"" goes from another jazz-jam to a house track halfway through -- a surprising and refreshing change. ""Travis"" has a melody that's a bit more elegant, but no less funky. The final track, ""Distant Earth,"" throws in some ethnic drumming for added flavor. All together, it's another mixed bag, but one that warrants investigation."
5,Absolute Foundation of Tonal Music,"This is an indispensable work for anyone with a serious interest in musical composition. It lays out the entire foundation of tonal composition (i.e.: counterpoint) in a lucid, organized systematic manner.The serious student of musical composition should have this book, work through it not once but regularly. I re-read it constantly and work through all the exercises again once or twice a year.It should also be used in conjunction with ""Structural Hearing Tonal Coherence in Music"" by Felix Salzer (Schenker's protégé)."
5,"required reading for composers, theorists, and historians","This is mostly valuable for its historical significance, but that is no mean thing, and it is worth your while working through it-every composer and theorist should. The translator distributes his English version of Fux's ""Gradus ad Parnassum"" between this and ""The Study of Fugue"" so I recommend you pick up a copy of ""The Study of Fugue"" too.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
1,WARNING- Does not include the 59 minute rapid bake!,"It's not amazon.com's fault, it is advertised on the box. But it doesn't have the 59 minute rapid bake feature! The rapid bakes available will take at least two hours."
2,salton warranty problematic at best,"After owning a breadman for several years, and worked fairly well, it has broken down. Most good companies I expect to have a good warranty, no questions asked, etc. However, the warranty is only one year. Basically, this says to me that this unit is only good in the short-term and then has problems. If you are confident in your work, then back it up with a good warranty. I was told I could return mine and get a refurbished one with only a 90day warranty for 40 dollars. NO thanks, Mr. Breadman"
4,Eastwood Sings Country.,"Eastwood play uncle Red, a drifter trying to get to the Grand Ole Opry. Along for the ride is Eastwoods son Klye."
5,Awesome,This stuff worked like a deam. Followed instructions and found leak right away. But light and glasses also. Shipped on time and good price.
5,Top Plaything.................,"Our two cats love these Boogie Mats, had to get each one their very own because when one got on it to play they wouldn't share so, now they each have one.Put fresh catnip in and they have a terrific time...........J Anthony"
4,Boogie Woogie,"This is a fun product for your cat. If your cat likes catnip, then they will love the boogie mat. The mat comes with a bag of nip, but it isn't very potent so you may want to add a little more. My cats don't play with it as much as I thought they would, but they do love to chew on the tassels. You should get this only if your cat is crazy about catnip!"
4,Delaneys,"Easy reading, as always from these ladies I was kept interested. Fun and a good relaxing read.Made yu feel like you new the characters."
4,Awesome Author,"My favorite author, Iris Johanson, has yet to disappoint me. I love all of her books and would recommend them to anyone."
2,meh,"Product was recieved quickly and burns fine, it just doesnt smell like Nightqueen. Would suggest the essential oils instead. :("
2,Not helpful,This teacher has horrendously bad posture and should fix that before teaching pregnant women. These exercises are extremely difficult. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at the end she gives some helpful tips on taking care of your body during pregnancy.
2,Too long,"This could have been a great 250 page book. The first 150 pages are pure background, half of which is absolutely irrelevant to the story. The author drones on about the religious epiphanies and work history of the victims and their families.As for trail life on the Appalachian Trail, I detected some gross factual errors that made me question the author's research. Damascus is not a week from Pearisburg on the AT, and Chestnut Knob is not, under any circumstances, a day's hike from Wapiti shelter, the scene of the crime.Although the narration of the crimes and subsequent manhunt are page turners, the book again needlessly boggs down in courtroom proceedings which are rehashed verbatim.I only recommend this book if you REALLY want to know about these murders...."
4,Not Too Long,This book was a little long but I really appreciated the research the author had done to bring this story to us and I did enjoy reading the background of the characters. I wish I had discovered this book about twenty five years ago when it was published. I would like to have thanked the author. It is an interesting read and I do recommend it.
1,A book to put you asleep,"Boring,boring,boring! The author spends way to much time discribing every pimple on each character. So much so by page 40, I forgot who was who, who's life experiences was who's and who was meeting who where. I have read many many books on the Appalachian Trail, but this one was a real snoozer. I bet this book would have been better if it had been written in about 300 pages less and possibley written by someone else. Of course the victims were nominated for sainthood because they never did a bad thing in there life. Just to much. You'd think the author was with them every second even in there intimit moments. Oh brother. If your interested in the murders,read the 3 pages on the internet instead of the 500 plus pages of fluff in this book. A tip,pass this one by and put your money towards a better book."
5,Women's Asics GT-2110 Running Shoe,I love this shoe. I had a pair previously and wore them forever. I wanted to replace them because of comfort and durability. I was able to find them on Amazon. I was very pleased with the vendor. Shoes arrived within a couple days. I will use this vendor again!
2,Very Comfortable,"I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted, but these were true to size and oh so comfortable. You really can feel the difference. Their return policy (60 days, used) also reassured me that if they did not work out, I wasn't stuck with them.*UPDATE* I've had the shoes for a few months now (well passed the 60 day return period) and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued (towards the sides of the shoes). I most definitely don't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already. Substracting some stars..."
5,Unbelievable!,"I started running again after many years. I bought average shoes due to not knowing if I would stick with it. After a few weeks of my feet hurting and feeling like they were numb I went and got fitted for shoes. These shoes had the ""ah"" factor right away. I didn't truly believe the ""shoe factor"" that states the shoes are everything. Boy was I wrong!!! They made an unbelievable difference and now 9 months later I am still running and have even entered several races. I wouldn't do it without these shoes. My running partner agrees. Her knees are not in good shape, but she is now doing great with these shoes. We're believers!"
5,Asics Gt 2110,I am an asics fan. I check Amazon and other web sites for the best price before I purchase. Amazon consistently has the selection and best price. greta kilpinen
5,These shoes kick ass!,"I finished a marathon on this pair of shoes - and I don't think I could have done it without them! I used to use a Reebok prior until 2009, which I thought was the best shoes on earth (bought the same model twice). But when I tried running on these shoes for the first time in 2010, I fell in love. Long distance running never felt so light and easy! Since then I only buy Asics. I bought another model last year, it was okay but not as good as this one - so I think my next purchase would definitely be this exact same pair!"
5,Amazingly comfortable for running,"This is my 3rd pair of Asics and this particular style is great for running, no break-in time required!"
5,Wonderful customer service and product,"I highly recommend Roadrunner Sports and I will order from them in the future. My shoes fit wonderfully. In fact, they are the best pair I own to help with my Plantar fasciitis. I did have a problem with them so I contacted Roadrunner--they immediately e mailed me a free shipping slip and I received a replacement pair in just a few days. They were so helpful and nice--their customer service is amazing."
4,"Good fit, but not long lasting","I have been running in this Asics series ever since I found them. They are a good fit, with a roomy enough toe box for a wider women's foot, but not too wide. They are supportive but light, maybe not suitable for a overpronator, but fine for a normal step. My only disappointment is that they wear out very quickly with regular use. All the asics in the 1900 and now 2000 series break down really fast. I often have splitting seems within a few days and the overall cushioning, support, and outer parts of the shoe wear out fast."
3,Not my best ASICS shoe,"I only wear ASICS shoes because I've tried every other shoe, and these are the best brand in my opinion. I run, on average, 10 miles per week. So far the shoes are fine, but they're nothing special. Typically I spend $85-$100 minimum on running shoes, and these I bought on sale for $60. My feet don't feel the kind of support that I usually get from brand new ASICS. Next time I'll bite the bullet and spend the $100+."
5,I really like this pen!!!,"I have used one of these pens for several years (ever since my old Visor Pro handheld). I didn't want a pen/pencil/lazer pointer, multi-purpose monstrosity, - just a pen and stylus. Also, I like a decent-size pen. Most PDA stylus pens are either way too thin or way too thick. This one is ""just right"" - This is a really nice pen, although the ink runs out pretty quickly. My old one was pretty beat up, so I was delighted to see that Platinum was selling them pretty cheap - a third of what I paid originally - but beware - they charge $4.99 EACH for shipping. It still means a good pen for an OK price, but $7.99 is a lot more than $2.99...."
5,Very nice and comfortable to use.,"I can't stand that little stylus that comes with the palm. This is nice and thick like a regular pen. Easy to use. The pen writes smoothly. The stylus tip is a nice bright red so you can be sure you have the right tip in place. Good price, too. I am afraid I will lose it, so I am ordering a couple more."
4,Fantastic stylus! Smooth pen!,This pen/stylus is a classy-looking item that has a great stylus tip and an extremely smooth-writing ball point pen combined in a double twist action housing. I got the pen mainly for the stylus and ended up loving the pen - it writes better than a Cross pen and even a little smoother than my fancy Shaeffer pen. Now I just need to find refills for the pen... the only negative I could find.
3,pen doesn'y fits in the stylus slot of many PDA cases,"This pen is not that slim. It will not fit in a palm case or a cassiopedia. It is still nice to have, but don't expect to keep it where you kept your orrigianal stylus"
4,Awesome! - Even If You're NOT Studying for the AP Test,"I truly loved this book. I am on an Academic Bowl Team and needed to be able to cover the information explained in AP English/ Comp. This book has helped oh so greatly in my playing ability, and I feel that I could pass the AP Test without have taken the class. The book clearly explains everything on the test and shows manners of remembering how and when to use certain things. I highly recommend it!"
2,"worst ending ever,completly spoiled the book","I purchased this title mainly because i like the artist.so i bought the ""complete"" edition thinking there would be alot more artwork and stories-as said in the discription-.but to my dissapointment there wasnt,just the script to the book which is just pointless seeming you read it throughout the story anyway and a diary from some1 in it.And thats it.the story starts off half good then is just rushed towards the end,like the writer thinks ""right i've had enough of this,lets just finish it up"".I suppose i can sell it on ebay when the film comes out to double the money i paid for it."
1,No Original Ideas anymore?,I liked this story when it was done in Vampirella by Mark Millar.I wonder why all of the author's stories feel so familiar?
2,Not A Big Fan,I like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while I'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax. This CD just didn't fit. There are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast/upbeat or there's too much talking/chanting. I found myself distracted when I put this CD on.
4,young old man,"Great to find old Cat Stevens, admired and enjoyed 40 years ago, in best of the shapes. Voice, expression and vitality untouched. Nice to have him back, no matter the exterior context, who cares(Quick and careful delivery from Amazon, thanks)"
4,He has returned!,"I was a huge fan of Cat Stevens. He always seemed to have such a lyrical insight. Poetic, passionate with an excellent rhythm and style. Not truly understanding WHY he left the world of music, I packed away his albums, assumed he was involved with some sort of ""cult"" and always rolled my eyes and shrugged my shoulders, if his name should come up as it had occasionally, in newspapers and general conversation.Now I know all thanks to his comeback and this DVD which gave me a lot of insight as to why he did what he had.He is older and very wise and philosopical - voice has a rougher edge to it now as Yusuf, but the Cat has returned. I have pulled out his older material, now on CD of course, and am relistening to everything he had to say back in the 70's. Wiser than most of us at such an early age, I believe he just had to take that break and rediscover himself more on a spiritual level. Call him a perfectionist.He's back and I recommend the DVD for true fans."
5,Welcome back Yusuf,"Loved the whole DVD compilation - the concert and the behind the scenes look at Yusuf's life after giving up his Cat Stevens days. It is amazing to see how Yusuf or Cat's stongs can touch you again after all these years. Some of the best songs that Cat Stevens played are all in this DVD.Welcome Back, Yusuf!"
1,Old Product....not able to use.,"When I received this product it was old and smelled funny. I'd never used it before, so I dont know what color it is supposed to be. Looking at the picture I assumed that it would be an opaque honey color, but it was brown which led me to believe that it was old. It also smelled funny....like old olive oil. Oh well, you live and you learn."
3,"To be fair, there is actually some beautiful music on this recording","I'm a fan only of Kathie Lee Johnson Gifford's Christmas Specials that aired in the '90s--in fact, those are a riot. I purchased this to hear the duet with Sandi Patty, and that duet is actually done very musically, and makes for a pleasant piece of music--and in fact, I found myself listening to some of the other songs, and I actually liked them. Some of them are really pretty, and Kathie Lee doesn't do a bad job vocally on them."
1,No Wonder Frank Cheated,Yet more evidence which testifies toward the flawed character of Kathy Lee. Highly deplorable.
5,Been waitin for a book like this!,"sooo much information. subjects on everything. i have over thirty books on natural and alternative medicine and once in a while i get one that is sothorough and easy to understand, thanks to james a duke."
3,Just OK,"For all the hype, it was average. I have shelves of herbal guides and agree that pictures and more detailed info would be better. Too preachy and too ""Don't try this at home...and just to be sure, I'm going to be very vague about how to use this..."" Also picked up a rather paternal tone, but that could be me."
1,Disappointed,The overall quality of this product is really bad. The material is very poor and the letters look like an at home iron on transfer project.
2,no difference,I think the song sounds like everyone elses music. I think def jam soul needs some fresh new creative sound.
3,3rd storee ...,This cd shows the creative minds of 3rd storee...they definatly have good vocal skills and they are very talented young men who are on the right path to success. Another great group in the making and they've just started...I strongly recomend this cd to anyone who's ready to experience a different kind of sound
4,An Incredible Effort,"This album consists of 12 tracks by an up and coming male group. The tracks on the album range from acoustic ballads to energetic hip-pop tracks. Songs such as 'Now I Can Breathe', 'I'm Sorry', 'You Don't Want Me To', 'Don't Lose Hope', and 'How Can This Be' display the incredible vocals that separate 3rd Storee from the rest of the male groups that are out right now. The songs 'Get With Me', 'Clap Your Hands', 'Superstar', 'All Aboard', 'Type of Mood', and 'What Would It Be Like' are more up tempo songs that seem to be written to touch the fan bases of some of their contemporaries. These songs at times appear to weaken the CD but overall 3rd Storee has made an incredible and empressive effort on this album."
1,Totally horrific rendering to DVD,"I was waiting for the release of this box set so that maybe i could get a remade version of the Highlander DVD which, as we all know, has to be the worst rendering to DVD in the market... Well let me tell you you're better of buying the VHS version. I won't even mention Highlander II since it is not only a horrible sequel to such a masterpiece it has as horrible a video quality as the first movie. Only good thing here is the audio quality which i'm sure is not worth the extra $$$. Stay away from this box set or any version of these movies in DVD format. Buy the VHS version of Highlander. You'll be much happier. I give this 1 Star cause it has Sean Connery in it. But if I had to evaluate DVD quality in both audio and video i would give it -5 stars."
1,The Worst DVD Rendering EVER!,"Don't waste your money on the Highlander DVD. It's frustrating to seea great movie so completely butchered. For some reason there is a THX Mastered label on the cover, even though the picture quality is just slightly better than Real Video on a 28.8 modem."
5,Great introduction/reference for weight training,"I'm glad I started with this book...it's well organized and very thorough. Covers all the essential things a person should know to get started in the weight room. It's also going to stay on my shelf for a long time as a reference, because it gives good tips on form, exercises, etc., as well as for other things that might pop up. you will probably want more info as you get more into training, but this book will continue to be of use as a reference."
5,Upbeat downtempo,"Anyone who's a fan of jazz-based music and electronica is sure to love this album. I happened upon them by chance when they opened for another band. Intrigued, I later bought their self-titled debut when I saw it in a store. Nublu Sessions has some tracks off that release, as well as all-new tracks. Nublu touches on a variety of styles, genres, vocals and tempos. It would be hard to be disappointed with this album. I also recommend getting their first album."
5,satisfied,"I received the item in excellent condition (no damage), but it arrived two days later than the estimated delivery date..."
3,"Weird, Strange, Freud","Well, it's going to keep you interested, that's for sure. Freud is dissecting some strange topics here, but it's informative, interesting and worth the read."
3,Zen Micro Photo .........very complicated device,"Super speedy delivery from Amazon.com as always. However this MP3 player is unbelievably complicated.........navigating through the player itself is fairly straightforward but trying to organize, delete or move files around from your computer is an exercise in frustration. In fact it's so complicated that tech support were not able to provide me with really pretty base information on deleting files while the device is plugged into the computer! I have experience with database design using programs like Access; this little product is more complicated. I'm sure there are solutions to the problems I'm experiencing but the question is how much time should you have to spend learning new software and organizing data in order to get the most out of your MP3 player?"
3,Owned for nine months,"Pros:I have had this mp3 player for about nine months I like it a lot it is asy to synce with rhasody to go.Cons:Touch pads are sensitive.Charging battery- sometimes I have this thing plugged in to the usb all day only to find it on and playing from the songlist. When I leave it I make sure it says docked. I don't lnow how to prevent that, it's annoying ecspecially if you plan to use it for a long period of time and the battery isn't charged fully.I think I will upgrade to the Crative vision M, ny husband has it and I like it much better."
3,portable music : ZEN MicroPHOTO 8mb,"I bought this unit for its plug-and-play capability, ""creative"" brand, and style, price. After using it for three months I do not like its ergonomics at all. Its sound quality is also a lot less than desired.Creative: This machine does not make CD quality sound from WAVs, it does not play FLACS, it is either overly sensitive or under sensitive to touch inputs and the toggling between options is NOT intuitive.On top of that the screen is not bright enough or glare-proof.I am happy with the price: around [...] bucks with all the credits and rebates."
4,great while it lasted,"i really loved this player until the hard drive failed. the sound was great, photos crisp, the cool blue light on the trim of the player and pretty much everything about it i loved. but the hard drive failed after a month and a half and i think i just gotten a bad one to begin with and i could have gotten another one, but insted i chose to get a refund to buy another Creative player with a bigger hard drive. ( i got the W now! love it too!) but i was able to fit about 1800 songs on this small, but sturdy player but my music collection is in the 10,000 range and i really did need more storage. but if your looking for an inexpensive alternative to the Ipod, i would get this over the Ipod anyday. it includes: fm radio, voice recorder, photos, wallpaper settings, software and removable battery. none of which are included with the 8GB ipod."
5,Great MP3 Player,"I just received the Zen Microphoto as a gift. Wow. It's much better than my prior MP3 player. The former player (a much smaller unit - I think a Nomad) was also a Creative, which lasted for several years and many hours in the gym. I even dropped the prior one, and it still works well. Therefore, I expect my Zen Microphoto to perform as well and to last as long. I've had no trouble transferring music from my laptop or listening to it on the Zen Microphoto. The controls are very easy to use and adjust through the menu screens. I also purchased the Traveldock to take it on the road and charge it when not connected to the computer. (I should mention that my partner has a Creative 30GB Nomad Jukebox Zen Nx which has lasted about 3 years so far and has been used very frequently when travelling, at home, at the gym, etc. I believe that our experience with Creative products demonstrates that they are excellent and reliable.)"
5,Better than an ipod,"This has the best sound quality- better sound then ipod. cheap, durable, and lightweight. charges and downloads music all on the same cord! The price is a steal. This is just a great product"
1,Disappointed BIG TIME!,I purchased this little mp3 player 4 months ago. Guess what? Now the battery life is 1 hour or less! The only good thing is that the battery is replacable but still who would like to replace the battery every 4 months. I highly recommend that you just get an Ipod even if this thing is cheaper. At least wait until Creative does something about their battery life.
3,"Sound it good, but that media explore has problem","The sound of this zen 8gb microphoto is good, the photo is also good. but I found the software which transfer cd to MP3 called ""media explore"" is bad. When I installed it, true it works, but this software will cause you windows explore ""not responsable"" when you install it(even not run) regularly. So you can't use windows explore without unstall ""media explore"".Creative's software design must be worse. That's the reason I give it 3 stars!"
1,Incompatible with most operating systems.,"This product is compatible ONLY with Microsoft Windows XP. Creative has really fallen short on what could have been a nice product by choosing to offer drivers for only one operating system.If you have Windows 2000/ME/98, don't waste your time with this product. There is absolutely no way to transfer files to it. I had one, tried it, and sent it back for a refund."
3,really nice...but not the best,"I actually have both this and the iPod Nano, and i like them both, although this player gets a lot less use. I actually plan on selling it. I like the color screen, but it makes my pictures look blueish and i dont ever use the FM Radio Feature. I enjoy my ipod more, mainly because it doesnt skip, IS actually quite sturdy (it's made out of metal, not wood like a pencil, so think before ytou say it will snap in half; I've sat on mine a lot), and i also love the fact that it uses iTunes, which is an AMAZING program. Don't get me wrong though, if you are looking for an mp3 player with a larger capacity than an iPod Nano, this is deffinitly the way to go"
2,iPods are #1 for a reason,"Whoa, what a disappointment! Sound is way below the quality of my iPod 6 GB mini. My iPod is charging constantly while I play it in my car with my Monster cable, and it is also charging while I work with my music files.Maybe the new, yet-to-be released Zens are better. One can always hope. I don't have anything Apple, except my trusty iPod, and I will gladly replace my Mini with the 30 GB iPod when I run out of space. You can't beat the clickwheel navigation of iPod either...awesome for those of use who work out while using our players, awesome for using while driving. Once again, Apple rules the world of MP3 players."
2,ipod Video is better,"In terms of features, interface, usability, ease-of-use.. ipod wins hands down.(but I must admit that I like the 8G capacity!)"
2,Not for the technically challenged,"First let me say the Zen Micro Photo has wonderful sound. The ear plugs were of good sound quality. I am very technically challenged my kids and husband have to help me with any thing technical. I found the dial on the Zen Micro Photo to be impossible to operate. It is VERY SENSITIVE to the touch, I could not even raise and lower the volume. Finally, when it began to freeze up on me regularly I did return this and Amazon kindly refunded all my money even the cost to ship it back."
3,Overall Good Product,"Very durable - I've dropped it several times hard and it keeps on ticking. The navigation is very touchy which can be tricky. The accessories are very limited. The ear phones that it came with are big. They keep falling out of my ears when I'm working out. I like how durable it is, I can always find smaller ear phones but I wish it was easier to navigate."
1,Better pray yours works out of the box,"Mine failed within 3 weeks--the software just hung. The manual is useless and the web faqs almost as much. No e-mail support, just web-based. After getting an RMA number, I mailed the unit back. Now (3 weeks later) they are asking for a $25 ""diagnostic fee"" before they'll look at the unit, along with a note not to reply to the e-mail. Instead they give you a hyperlink back to their Customer Support web page, where you need to fill out an e-mail form and plug your RMA number in. (I'm assuming that the request for a ""diagnostic fee"" is a mistake. If not, I'll be talking to the District Attorney's Consumer [..] division).The amount of hassle I've gone through over this *far* outweighs the benefits it has over the iPod (which, when it works, really are there). This may be a technically superior product, but Apple Support is easy. Creative's is as shabby as I've ever been subject to.Never again."
4,Pretty good.,"This was a birthday present for my 17 yr-old son. He claims it filled his expectations. Good quality sound. Liked the personally customizable background. Didn't give the 5th star because you can't see photos and listen to music at the same time, plus it classifies groups with ""The"" as part of it's name(i.e. The Beatles) all under ""T"" which makes this one a rather large category difficult to search through. Which in the end is not such a big deal."
4,Pleasantly Satisfied,"I am quite satisfied with the look and sound of this product. It is much smaller than I had pictured also. I have had it lock up twice, but to its defense it was on sound files with poor quality. I had to pull the battery, then I synced with my computer again, and it worked fine. Overall, great product for the low price!"
4,Solid Product,"Its a very good product, holds a ton of songs and the color screen is pretty sweet. The product works well, and is a real solid alternative to the IPOD. The battery life in my opinion leaves something to be desired, but all in all its not that bad. The option to purchase a replacement battery, is a real advantage that this product has over the IPOD."
1,Worst purchase ever...,"At first I was really pleased with my Zen, it was great. It had enough storage space for everything I needed. Navigation was simple, though it took some getting used to. The one problem I ever had was it's final problem. I was listening to music and all of a sudden it froze. So I figure it's not a big deal and I restart it and it rebuilds its library. And it froze again within 3 minutes, so I restarted it and it starts in ""Recovery Mode"". I had used it several times before just formatting it and starting over. So I tried that. However it refused to connect to the computer at all. I tried any number of things to connect it. The creative website offers no support for issues that aren't simple. So now I can't use it. And quite frankly I wouldn't use it again, too many problems. So I went and bought a Zune. I couldn't be happier, so thanks for sucking Zen!"
2,Don't last,"I was really happy with my Zen Microphoto until it stopped working after less than two years. Creative offered me a new one for $150 (which is half what I paid for it), but I'll probably try to find one without built-in obsolescence. I think that a $300 device should last longer than that, and I wasn't impressed with Creative's after market support. My other big problem was I could never get it to work with Windows XP, although Vista seemed to support it OK."
4,Creative Zen Micro Photo 8 GB MP3 Player,"This is a nice product. The only problem is that when charged through your computer it takes forever to fully charge. Additionally, if you utilize the equalizer function, the battery runs down exceptionally quick. Despite those functions, the overall product has great features and a great sound!"
3,Good design with mediocre sound quality,"Well, everything was said already:pros: Compact design, battery life, 8GCons: touch pad is not perfect ... BUT BUT BUTFor those who care about sound above all:This toy can play loud - better that any iPod yet I was really dissapointed from its mediocre bass performance. It soulds like it can not play a clean Bass sound - it sounds distorted and it smears the rest of the spectrum.That's not the way I like my player to sound."
2,Went Through Two In Less Than a Month,"I chose this player over other similar mp3 players because of its removable battery. No battery lasts forever and I didnt like the idea of having to send it to the manufacturer just to replace it when it goes bad. For the most part, I was satisfied with the player until it stopped working after two weeks. It actually ""worked"" but it stopped letting me add/delete music. So I sent it back and got a replacement. I just thought that I must have got a faulty one but then my second one started randomly turning off during the middle of a song. It didnt matter if the battery was low or fully charged, it would just turn off for no reason. I sent it back and Amazon gave me a complete refund."
1,creative lab zen not consumer friendly,"I purchased this for my son. After downloading software, he was not able to transfer music from Media Player. He was told to change something in the registry so the USB port could communicate. First of all my other son has an apple I-pod so we knew the port was fine. Secondly I spoke to my brother who has lived in Silcon Valley and has worked in the computer industry for over 30 years, he said you never should change anything in the registry in windows XP. Creative does not have a toll free number to call and it takes 24-48 hours to receive an E-mail response from them. This is nonsense."
3,Vision/Zune,"Sorry but for the same price you can get a 30 Zune, or 30 Zen Vision both show video, just FYI"
1,Been using it one week - DEAD!,"I've never had a product [...] out after one week of use. The screen froze up and no matter what troubleshooting tip I tried from the creative website, nothing worked. Now I'm waiting to hear back from email support because they don't have 24 hour phone support. Not impressed. Would have gotten an iPod, but this thing was given as a gift."
1,Better pray yours works out of the box,"Mine failed within 3 weeks--the software just hung. The manual is useless and the web faqs almost as much. No e-mail support, just web-based.

This may be a technically superior product, but Apple Support is easy. Creative's is as shabby as I've ever been subject to.Never again."
1,Complicated,"It may be a great device, but I've seen intercontinental ballistic missile launching systems less complicated. I, and a computer consultant for my company, have spent two days trying to figure out how to use,load and organize it and are really frustrated. If I still had the box, it would be on its way back to Amazon. There needs to be a manual to explain its workings."
4,opinions of a 66 year old on my zen,Quality sound. Rather sensitive touch control that takes a bit of getting used to. Ear phones are single size and drop out easily - hence only a 4*. Nicely compact & solid - you know its in your pocket and it does not feel fragile. For a novice-computer person the software is not too difficult to instal. Overal - a good buy.
4,Good Product,"I bought this mp3 player so I could download music from napster. I use it at the gym, run it thru the radio in my car and hook it up to speakers and listen to music at work.The only complaint I have is that sometimes you have to keep hitting buttons to get where you want on the menu. Other than that, I'm very happy with the player's performance."
2,IT WORKED FOR ABOUT A YEAR....,"I BOUGHT A CREATIVE ZEN 8GB MP3 PLAYER LAST SUMMER. IT WORKED WELL FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR, AFTER WHICH TIME I COULD ONLY TURN IT ON BUT NOT PLAY ANY MUSIC. WHEN WE CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, THEY ASKED IF IT WAS BOUGHT OVER 3 MOS AGO. THEN THEY ASKED IF WE HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY; WHICH WE DID NOT. THEY SAID ""THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT."" THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WAS THAT IT WAS ACCIDENTLY DROPPED A COUPLE OF TIMES. BUT THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE DESTROYED IT. ANYWAY; I BOUGHT AN APPLE IPOD TO REPLACE THIS UNIT. THE OTHER THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS UNIT WAS THE CONTROLS ON THE FRONT OF THE UNIT."
1,Very bad quality,"I bought a Creative Zen Microphoto less than a month ago. It worked great for about 3 weeks, until one day it shut down, and it never turned on again.I am not the only one who has had problems with the item, a friend bought at about the samne time I did, and one of the buttons doesnt work anymore.I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone, It looks nice, and it is cheap for what you get, but I would rather get something that works."
3,Okay I guess,"I was in love with it when I first got it. I wanted to get the IPod nano, but at the time it wasnt in pink. So, I found the zen microphoto and saw the colors it had to offer. So I bought it and it was what I expected it to be and even better. I listened to it a lot. I put it aside for a while. When I finally got the chance to listen to it again, I realized that it skips songs. I really dont know why it began to do this. I was disappointed. But its only select songs that it does it to, im not sure why. Also, it has a very low battery life. I listen for not even 1 hour and the battery life becomes low. Overall, I think its a good product."
1,Disappointed @ Creative MP3,"We are anti-IPOD. We own a 6gb Zen, 4gb Zen photo & 1 MUV. So, I purchased this 8gb Zen back in Nov06 as a christmas gift for my teenage daughter. It did work for couple of weeks (from chirstmas till mid Janurary). Then it was the problem, when she was listening to music and all of a sudden it froze. So I figure it's not a big deal and I restart it and it rebuilds its library. And it froze again and again. I went to the Creative discussion Forum website and I found that everone has the problem. Creative should have a recall on this unit (this is not a cheap unit) So now I can't use it. And I'll send it to Creative for repair or replacement."
4,cptrich,"This mp3 player is great, I love how easy it is to download photos and songs, the playback sounds great, lightweight easy to carry and so much better than the I POD. The only drawbacks are the usb cord is too short and the headphones ear pieces are too big. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars. For the price you can not go wrong with the Zen for 8 gbs you have more storage plus photos that the I POD does not. The case does not scratch like the Ipod. Plus it is really nice looking ( I have the red)."
4,Zen MicroPhoto MP3 player a good value,"I purchased this MP3 player after carefully comparing to othe MP3 players by other manufacturers. The Zen Microphoto 8 GB player is not the best on the market nor does it have all the bells and whistles of some of the other players which cost quite a bit more but dollar for dollar it is a good buy. The user menu is intuitive and easy to learn. The unit seems fairly rugged. Mine has been dropped a couple of times but continues to work flawlessly. The Zen MicroPhoto gets one demerit in my book, however, because the touch pad is overly sensitive making operation a bit frustrating. Even setting the touch pad sensitivity to the lowest level does not resolve this problem. If you're looking for a good value in an MP3 player and don't need scores of gigabytes of storage, consider the Zen MicroPhoto 8 GB MP3 player."
1,Expected Better Things,"I have had nothing but problems with this Creative product. I am constantly rebooting and half the time that doesn't work, I've tryed to reload the firmware and that dosen't help either.My next step is to call customer support - I'm really looking forward to talking to India (not)."
2,NOT GOOD FOR AN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE USER!!!!,"Got my daughter this for Christmas - No problems if you are sitting quietly on the couch listening to it!!DON'T buy this if you plan on jogging, bike-riding or even driving on a bumpy road!! Broke within 45 days of easy listening - Customer service was fairly helpful with return of product however. We have had all types of mp3's in our house including ipod's, creative and cheaper brands - Don't waste $250.00 on this one!!"
4,Good Player-Not so good pictures,"This is my first MP3 player and as a starter player, it's fine. However, the screen started giving me trouble right away. I lost a whole line of pixels near the bottom of the screen. The company actually states that they prefer that you return faulty merchandise to the store. Unfortunately, anyone who buys from amazon knows what a pain in the rear returning things can be and I am a busy person so I decided to live with it. The playback is good, although the headphones that came with it are pretty mediocre. Also its software isn't very good either. However, it's a good price for eight megabytes of music to take with you wherever and when it breaks, I think I'll be ready to invest in a nicer Ipod."
3,Meh,"Got the 4GB in July, and took it on holiday, only to find that the battery life lasted half the advertised length, and that it didn't have a charger, and it was a pain to charge without the specified charger, which, by the way, costs an extra 20 (over in England). Took it back, and got the 8GB. It has a brilliant interface, is colourful, not overly stylish, but produces a great sound and picture, but it also freezes, skips tracks, and is a rather slow, outdated money making machine."
1,Bad Choice!,"I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it. It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months. The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs, albums titles, and eventually that there was even any music to listen to. Now I have a 200$ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC. Customer service? Don't count on it. So if your into extensively troubleshooting, highly frustrating, pieces of junk, this is a great product."
5,Outstanding!,"Outstanding design, performance and price. I can't understand why i-pod gets all the attention."
1,"Attractive, expensive, paperweight.",Have had this player for about a year and it has never worked properly. More often than not the software used for loading and organizing files does not see the Zen when it is connected. This despite the fact that windows does see it. On the rare occasion that it does successfully connect the Zen and the computer software freeze up before I can load more than a couple of dozen songs. I have gone through all the steps Creative recommends in order to correct this all the way down to editing registry files. I would give this zero stars if I could.
4,"Good player, needs a little help.","Bought this player in Jan 06. Picked the Creative player after doing a bit of research on all the larger MP-3 units. When i got the unit in the mail, it was very easy to set up and run. The screen is nice, crisp and clear, even in bright light situations. There are only one item that i would like to see fixed with this player and that is the controls. The slider/selector touch pad is difficult to master and prone to erroneous inputs. Other than that, ive been quite pleased with it."
2,Good until it died at 11 months old,"Enjoyed my MicroPhoto until it just froze. Even after several hard resets will not do anything. The freeze problem seems to be a known issue. But Creative wants $25 just to look at it even though it is still under year warranty. I called and the recording said that since I hadn't bought the extended warranty, I would have to pay to talk to someone."
3,Satisfied...but,ProsGreat sound qualityPerfect size - smaller than I expectedEasy installation and file/playlist transferA lot of space for the priceConsBattery life shorter than expected.Menu a bit clunkyI've had it for three weeks and am still not used to the touch pad. I always end up selecting things I don't mean to.Who needs photos on an MP3 player? I think they just add that to raise the price. I wish there was an 8GB without photo capability that was less expensive.OverallTo me the most important thing in an mp3 player is sound quality. That combined with the amount of space and the easy transfer of playlists makes this a good deal.I would buy it again if I had to do it over.
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! This player has gone bad twice for me and I have had it less than a year. Creative customer service is awful. You have to pay them 12 dollars just to talk to them on the phone, and although email support is available it is not at all helpful. In addition to this, if the product is still under the one year warranty a 25 dollar ""diagnostic fee"" is charged each time the player is sent in for repair. Unless you want your mp3 player to be complete garbage in less than a year, purchase something else. I am giving up on this one and purchasing a different brand."
5,Creative Zen Micro Photo 8 GB MP3,"This was a gift for my son's 13th birthday. We could not get it to work but when we contacted the vendor they sent us a replacement pronto. The second one has worked great! Happy with product, even happier with service."
4,almost perfect,For all you people who think ipods are the best things that have happened to music then you are stuiped. I hate how they trap you into itunes and don't let you use anty other program. Now I love the Zen Micro it is small and sleek and has wonderful sound. I also love all the featuresThe one thing i don't like is the FM tuner because you have to fight to get a signal. Also the finger pad is sometimes sencitive
2,"Great Player, but no Audible support...","I love this player! It takes time to get used to the touch-buttons (I've never used an ipod before), and the ability to view photos while music is playing would be nice, but in general this is a nicely-executed product.My biggest gripe however, is the lack of Audible support. Creative has done a good job of making it's devices compatible with this popular audio-book service - I find it an incredible oversight that support wasn't included with the Microphoto. Be aware of this if you decide to purchase one.To 'digitally-sign' a petition for Creative to include support in the next firmware update, head over to the Creative Lab Discussion Forums, and search for: ""Petition: Audible support for Zen Microphoto & all future Creative players (including Vision:M)""I'd rate 4-or-5 stars if this support was there, since this is my primary use of an MP3 player."
1,couldn't load music on it,"I had a Zen Touch 20Gb that I loved, but after 2 1/2 years of hard use, it stopped working. So, I bought this one. It was great when I took it out of the package. I downloaded all the programs and hooked it up to the computer to charge. After it finished charging, I tried to download music on it and I couldn't. No matter what I did, my computer would not recognize the player. I kept getting messages that the player was not detected. I tried another computer and I got the same results. After researching the problem and calling the company, I found out that this is a common complaint with this product. I am so disappointed and I am returning it."
1,Two died after two months each,"Based on the very good performance of my old Zen Micro 6Gb (still fully functional) I purchased a Zen Microphoto for my daughter. It just died after about 6 weeks. I got it replaced. New one, same story. Did not want to have it replaced. Not worth it."
1,Customer support sucks...,"Thought I'd go with an iPod alternative, big mistake. Player hangs during transfers, then crashes, rebuilds the library and all the song titles are a mess. Tech support was rude and condescending, no one would deviate from the script, which recommends ""small transfers"", less than 100 songs. So in order to fill the player, over 20 transfers would be required. When I said I was trying to transfer 7 GB the woman laughed at me. I want this to be a good player, but it has been a headache so far."
2,3 Strikes Creative is out!,"I bought my first Creative MP3 a few years ago, it's big and bulky, but I liked the set-up and had read warnings galore about the I-Pod. It worked well for several months, then stopped allowing me to dock and download anything. I bought my LAST Creative Microphoto last November. It freezes, it rebuilds, it freezes, it rebuilds. If you take the battery out for more than an hour, it might restart. All those hours collecting music... Wasted! I'm done with Creative."
4,Pretty good box,Overall it is a pretty good box. It seems a little slow to respond to commands from the remote. And it takes a rather long time to start up.
1,slow and boring,"i dont know why there are so many good reviews... after 150 pages this book is all about a girl rambling to herself in a swamp about baseball and her boring dysfunctional family. i keep reading it the same way you watch a trainwreck.... i keep asking myself, can it really be this bad? how can king make money writing this junk?"
4,My Book Review,"This book was like a breath of fresh air after reading Dreamcatcher. The plot is very simple: a survival story about a little girl lost in the woods and she is looking for her parents but doesnt find them til the end of the book. King manages to avoid the psychological babbling of his recent books but still pull you in with well developed characters.In this story a little nine year old girl must battle the elements, her fear of a stalking creature, and the deterioration of her body and senses.This book is not meant to scare you into the wee hours of the night but it will keep you turning the pages just the same. King makes you care about this girl and whether or not she will survive, which makes it a given that she will (this isn't a Bachman novel). Knowing this doesn't take away from the intensity of her struggle.I highly recommend this to Stephen King fans or anyone who loves a good read."
1,This book is just bad!!,"I like Stephen King. But this book was a waste of my time and money. I wanted to stop reading mid-way because it was so predicable what was going to happen at the end. So many endless pages about the forest/wood. It just dragged, on and on. I have to rate this at 1 star, because I have no other choice. But is should be a -5 stars."
3,Frightening!,Trisha is lost in the woods of Maine for about a week. She begins to hallucinate baseball player Tom Gordon accompanying her through the thicket. What she doesn't imagine is something (not someone) stalking her through the woods. The climax is very exciting. The book does tend to drag a little through the middle. King does an excellent job of scaring you. This book is good but not great.
3,Not bad,"This wasn't the most exciting book I've ever read. In fact at times (in the middle of the story) it was pretty dull, but it made me feel sorry for this poor little girl, and I wanted to finish it to see how or if she would ever get out of the woods. I might have enjoyed it more if I was a baseball fan, but I'm not. But, all in all it wasn't bad."
3,"Well-crafted story, but not much meat","This was a typical King story in regards to the quality ofwriting, but there wasn't much of an actual *story*. It's only 224 pp!And what about what King wrote in the forward of *Four Past Midnight*?The whole lot about having written the four pieces in the collection and ""they were too long for a short-story, and too short for a novel.""? So he waited until he had enough to make a book? Well, he didn't wait with this one--at a cost of almost as much as one of his 500-700 pp novels, *TGWLTG* just ain't worth it. END"
4,Great Read with a Soft Ending,"I really liked this book. Told in the point of view of a little girl lost in the woods was refreshing. I have recommended this book to my 16 year old son. The book really kept my attention and I couldn't put it down. Then, at the end, it just fizzled out. I wish S.K. would have put as much enthusiasm in the ending as he did throughout Trisha's journey in the woods.And let this be a fictional lesson to parents going through divorces not to create such a hostile environment when they have kids to consider first. hmmm..."
3,King has made better ones before,"If I hadn't been given the novel as a present I probably wouldn't have picked it up in a while, but I believe that Stephen King has written much better novels than this one. He is characterized by being a master of terror, but there wasn't almost any terror portrayed here as in other, usually older, novels of his. Though I guess it would be fine for younger readers. So they won't be scared off too soon by King and dare to read his novels further."
4,Oops!,"It is a good book but certainly not ""hot horror"" as categorized above.Unfortunately, I fear there will be people who choose not to read this book as a result of its headline here.As avid King readers know, some of his books simply do not fit the stereotype that exists in many minds. This is one of those books."
3,"I'm glad she made it out, because I didn't.","The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was good, but not great. I was looking for more and didn't get it. In any Stephen King novel, there is a bit of the supernatural that drives the book forward. I didn't get it here, so I was let down. However, it was still a good book and recommended for those looking for a safe read."
2,:weiver ruoy rof eltit a retne esaelP,"This book didn't do it for me. And while there are obviously many people who love books where nothing happens and there's really no big point to be made, I'm not one of them. I could have spent the time it took to read this snoozer doing pushups, but instead I'm a scrawny guy with a super-dull plot crowding his subconscious. Thpppt to you, Stephen King, for stealing my muscles."
3,Recycled King!,"King wrote an earlier book about a woman that was accidently chained to a bed in a log cabin (he's written so many that I forgot the name). In it the woman struggles to survive and escape from her bonds. While doing this she has time to examine her own life and realize a great deal about herself. Well in this book, instead of a woman we have a girl (Trisha) and instead of being chained to a bed, she is lost in the woods. While trying to survive and reach civilization, Trisha also examines her life and starts to realize a lot of things about herself. While doing that she fantasizes about Tom Gordon, a relief pitcher for the Red Sox. Sometimes she imagines seeing him and getting advice from his image. I think because King is such a big Red Sox fan that he needed to put together something with the Red Sox.The books tends to drag a little past the middle. I might have rated this book a little higher had I not read the first book (which I thought was a lot better)."
1,King's Worst Effort,"Though I have been an avid fan of Stephen King's for 15 years, I must say that this work is completely unworthy of his talent. Rather than a novella, it should have been written as a 10-12 page short story so its readers would not have to have suffered for so long. I have read almost every thing King has ever written, and for the first time, I skimmed the majority of the book. After about 5 chapters it was no longer interesting what might happen to the young heroine, who, for whatever reason, believed Tom Gordon would see her though her ordeal. It was a more arduous journey attempting to read the story than it was for the girl to be lost in the woods. For anyone who is a true Stephen King fan, this book will be a huge disappointment, and anyone who isn't a huge fan should not judge his writing prowess on this piece of trash. This is by far the worst piece of literature King has ever published."
3,"A good story, but told before....","I was actually listening to the audiobook, read by Anne Heche (who added a lot to the story with her narration, I think).While listening to the book, I had thought the girl was a bit older than her 9 years, as Stephen King writes the protagonist as a mature individual. [She doesn't necessarily 'act' her age until the end when she is so desparate to get home].'Tom Gordon' refers to the baseball player she of whom she is a fan; who shows up as a 'spirit' to motivate her to keep on going. [The protagonist ran away after her brother and divorced mother were arguing while on a trip, and soon regretted her actions].This type of story [a child is lost, survives on his or her own while parents search] has been told before, but this story is told pretty well."
4,Solid novella.,"Girl gets lost in the woods, does everything right, and comes out unscathed."" NOT! Stephen King takes you into the woods, the DEEP woods, and lets you know it...right down to the last blistering, bubbling mosquito bite. Ouch! Forget the bug repellant...there ISNT any! The strength of this novella lies in sheer description. I wont go into further details, but lets just say this novella makes a ""bad night of camping out"" look GREAT...not good, GREAT! Enjoy this book;you'll enjoy the safe haven of your home after the final sentence is read."
2,Worst Stephen King I have read,"If I hadn't gotten this one in an airport, and then was a captive audience, I would never have finished it. I suppose if you were a big baseball fan, it would help your enjoyment of this book a lot. The end leaves you wondering, in fact years after reading it, I still wonder sometimes."
3,Lackluster writing for Stephen King.,"While this is not a bad book, it is most certainly not in keeping with what most would expect from a Stephen King book. It is lacking in horror, suspense and drama. Truly not what a true King buff would read were it not for having his name on it. It was disappointing to say the least."
5,Great!,"This was a great book! My first of Stephen King (I know, I know). I have a feeling it is very different from his other books, just judging from their movie versions, which are probably pretty chopped up. I really enjoyed this book, it was breath-taking to see what was going to happen next. A page-turner!"
4,The Girl who loved Tom Gordon,"A spellbinding book that will keep you turning the pages. The book shows greatly in detail the changes a mind makes when you are alone in the dark, miles and miles away from anyone and anything.I could not stop reading this book. I couldn't put the book down. This book was exhileraing and action packed. All wilderness loving people this is your book.This book realliy goes into depth of the mechanics of the way a person thinks and how they gradually go insane."
4,Beautiful,"Stephen Kings never stops to amaze. This book was a great tale about courage, struggle, and love. I don't want to tell to much about the story, but I can tell you - this book can make you think. My heart went out for little Trisha McFarland, as she is lost in the woods, her only hope for survival a walkman - so she can here the baseball games. I give this a big thumbs up - as it makes human life and the relationships we have seem very real."
1,The Girl Who Loved T.G. & Wasted My Time,"I had not read any Stephen King and picked up this novel as a sample. A huge disappointment. The story is weak and contains little suspense. Given the nature of his success, I assume this work is not indicative of Mr. King's abilities."
1,disappointing-a yawn,"After enjoying King's lyrical prose and some of the best storytelling I have ever read in 'Bag of Bones' and experiencing the final walk along the Green Mile, 'Tom Gordon' failed. King used the idea of being lost in the woods to try to evoke fright but never does.The best of King's new works consist of original plots mixed with remarkable dialogue-both of which are absent here.King's attempt seems to show that even the best writers have their off days-better luck next time. Any King afficiando looking to be enthralled or excited should not read this book."
4,King pitches a near-perfect game!,"The 9-innings with Trisha are wonderfully described. Having spent some time in some dank, bug-ridden New Hampshire woods, I could almost feel myself trying to swat away the noseeums as I read the book. And the ""did he or didn't he"" appearances/advice from Gordon - and the ""was it or wasn't it"" ambiguity of ""the threat"" leave the reader to make up his or her own mind. Really good reading!"
4,"Not your usual, but still good","Whenever an author like Stephen King strays from a tried and true formula, he opens himself up to critcism. But, I for one enjoy these forays into the untested. I think Mr. King is a very talented writer in any genre, even those outside of his typical ""horror"" stories. I thought this was a compelling story, although not as ""lively"" as most of his readers are used to. I found it gripping and interesting, since it wasn't typical. And, most importantly, I cared whether or not the girl got out alive, which is more than I can say for some of his recent characters in his more accepted form of writing."
2,boring,I collect Kings books in hardback only. I hate to say it but this book and his last 4 are boring. He used to write scary to where you were griped in the book while reading. Now Dean Koontz is kicking kings butt. I keep buying them out of habit but don't enjoy reading them any more. I always drift away from Kings books.They just don't have that hold on you like they used to. Sorry I don't mean to be cold. I couldn't write a book if i tried.Lynnae
2,Low on horror and adventure,This book is great if you need instructions on how to survive in the woods. There are very few scary moments and it is hardly suspenseful. Go for Bag of Bones instead!
3,so so effort,"As a fan of Stephen King who reads everything he puts out I was a little disappointed with this book. He has tried this style before with better results(Gerald's Game). I do think that writing in this style allows the reader to see the range of King's talent as a writer...horror is not his only medium. I would not reccomend this book to one who had never read King before, however. Real King fans might apprieciate the effort, but it must be kept in mind that ""they can't all be gems."""
2,What happened to the King of Horror??,"Being a TRUE fan of Stephen King I was disappointed by this book. His readers depend upon his writting style! This book seem hastily written and thought over. What was this bear thing in the woods and Why was it following Trisha? Nobody knows and will never know. I thought after his last ""bad"" novel, ""Bag of Bones"" He'd return to his good writing, his style, the horror he's known for. Let's get back to his true form and stop wasting our time with this dribble."
3,Please don't tell him he can't do something anymore!,"Immediately prior to beginning work on the exquisitely boring Gerald's Game, some one made the mistake of telling King his female characters were ""too thin"", that he needed to work on rounding them out. Evidently someone made the same mistake and told him his characterizations of female children needed work. Thus, we have The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. Like Gerald's Game, it's somewhat pointless. But unlike Gerald's Game, it's actually a neat little package. I'm still unsure if I was turning the pages to see what happened next or turning them ~hoping~ something would happen next, but regardless, it was a page-turner. And while the ""monster in the closet"" was nature all along, it was a formidable (if invisible) monster. While a departure from what I normally read King for, I enjoyed it. And I hate to admit that."
4,King Believes in God!?!,"I have read a few Stephen King books, but admit I only read the ones I feel have potential to reflect Shawshank and Stand By Me qualities. Most don't but this one does. King presents a wonderful story of how baseball and God often drag the outcome to the last pitch of the last inning. As a youth pastor two things ring true, God often makes us wait until next year and then answers in the bottom of the ninth, and we don't always like the final score."
3,Definitely not his best,"This book was a refreshing alternative to King's usual horror story habits, and I'm glad to see that he's trying out new styles and genres. However, I was not all too enthralled with TGWLTG. It was well-written, descriptive, original and cute, but it lacked any interesting plot twists. I enjoyed it, but at times I was anxious for something different to happen and whenever I felt like something was going to take place, nothing ever did. Tricia McFarland was a sweetie-and-a-half, however, I was anything but impressed with this book as a work of literature."
3,Good Read,"To the readers who came before me and said this book was boring, I must disagree. I think Stephen King's true talent lies in his ability to get inside a character's head and give a sometimes creepy, often hilarious account of what they are thinking. This is a great example of that talent. It's a simple story without a lot of flash, but I never found it boring. ""A good read."""
2,predictable plot,"I can't believe that readers were ""touched"" by Trisha McFarland....how could you care when it was SO obvious that she would make it out of the woods?This story( please note: I say story, not novel!) would have been more suspenseful had the child molester in fact been in the woods...hiding from him would have seemed more plausible than being stalked for days by a bear! As to the ending, how about Trisha's parents arranging to have the real Tom Gordon come to meet her @ the hospital? Her disappearance had been publicized, so it would not have been unrealistic for a major leaguer to respond after hearing of her devotion. Now that would have been a big finish to an otherwise lame book!P.S. Believe it or not, I am a Stephen King fan!"
2,BOOOO!!!!!,"hmmm....how does one say this?? this book is not very good. there was a time when this good man we all know as stephen king could put life into the dead. he took dracula and made him into a town. he brought the devil back to life in an antique store. this is the same man who reinvigorated telekenisis at a high-school prom. but those days may be over now. if this novel is any indication of a new direction, a new form, a new genre, a new anything that may be permanent, than society may have to kiss those heydays of interest a sweet goodbye. this book is as boring as most any ancient classic and without the major literary merit. i'm sorry mr. king, but if u intend to go down as one of america's greatest writers than something must be done, for to go out like this would be far from great."
4,Different than King's usual stuff but good.,"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was a moving tale, one of those books which have touched me deeply. Of all the books I've read in the last few months, only The Triumph and the Glory touched me as profoundly as King's latest. I highly recommend it, in fact I highly recommed both books!"
4,A study of prepubescent survival!,"I've read most of Stephen King's novels and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is quite different from the others. I thoroughly enjoyed it's captivating account of 9yr. old Trisha's ordeal lost in the forest.Her survival instincts and "" know how"" sort of made me wonder if I could accomplish such a feat, never mind my ""camper experienced"" 8yr old granddaughter,but iI guess,""what a difference a year makes"". Trisha's instinctual survival efforts seemed a little too mature for her age. However the book is a fast and easy read and another Stephen King ""must read""."
5,A great one day snack!,"This is not The Stand, a feast for several days, but it certainly is a very tasty snack when one's personal reading time is limited. Perhaps those disappointed readers have lost the knack of becoming a Trisha, heart pounding, trying to stay calm, singing in the dark... A wonderful lose yourself for a day book."
3,This book should stay lost in the woods,"Am I the only one who thought this story was a total snooze? I realise that the premise of the story limited it somewhat but essentially all this is about is a girl getting lost in the woods and having hallucinations about her favourite baseball player. After I put this book down, I had no better understanding of the protagonist, Trisha, than I did when I started it. The baseball theme was effective, but Tom Gordon's role in the book is never explained. I was disappointed in this book, but I almost always enjoy reading Stephen King. Yet 'The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon' lacked humour and drama. Worse, it was SLOW. King can do better than this. Hey Stephen, don't worry, even great ones are allowed to stumble."
5,A Good Summer Read!,"First, I'd like to submit that summer books needn't be long. Second, Stephen King novels don't need to make your skin crawl!! In this short novel I found plenty of suspense, this is written from a child's perspective and it brought me back to my childhood and some near misses with ""getting lost"". Despite being a guy in his early 40's I found myself relating very well to Trish'. As an adult I was hooked on the depth of detail in this adventure (after all with a one character story you better have background). Now this isn't ""THE STAND"" or ""THE SHINING"" and I don't think it should be compared to them. It was a nice summer read!!!"
2,"THE ""KING"" HAS DEFINETELY LOST THE CROWN!","After ""Bag of Bones"", another novel that testify the new writing style of Stephen King. I don't like it at all! The plot of this book is simple, there's only one character. In short: just a good tale for kids, nothing more, nothing less. A REAL fan of the REAL Stephen King can't to anything but missing the novels that consecrated him the King of Horror."
2,WHERE'S THE CREAM FILLING?,"A good surface plot but nothing underneath. I kept thinking that with every page turn something new and exciting would happen but it was the same thing ... bugs, dark, rain etc... Definetly not one of King's best."
3,An Easy Weekend Read,"A girl lost in the woods, a slightly interesting plot. But hardly the kind of thing that you would come to expect from King. However, that aside, the book contains a feel of actually being in the childs place and makes these woods come alive. The book isn't all that long and should hold your attention enough to finish it at a moderate pace."
4,The amazing story,"This book was like a breath of fresh air after reading Dreamcatcher. The plot is very simple: a survival story about a little girl lost in the woods scared to death and she's looking for her mom and brother and finds them at the end of the book. King manages to avoid the psychological babbling of his recent books but still pull you in with well developed characters.In this story a little nine year old girl must battle the elements, her fear of a stalking creature, and the deterioration of her body and senses.This book is not meant to scare you into the wee hours of the night but it will keep you turning the pages just the same. King makes you care about this girl and whether or not she will survive, which makes it a given that she will (this isn't a Bachman novel). Knowing this doesn't take away from the intensity of her struggle.I highly recommend this to Stephen King fans or anyone who loves a good read."
3,Dull as paint,I stopped reading this very early because the character's inner monologue read like a middle-aged man trying to write like a 9-year old girl thinks. It didn't work.
2,This book was overhyped and not scary enough,"Stephen King's horror/sports dramatization fails in my book. The story is terrible, and does not even get scary until the end. It is mostly suggestion. Suggestion can be more scary than truth, but in this case, it is not. Dont buy this book, it is not worth the small amount of money that it costs."
2,Before reading this book - make strong coffee,"I found this book very long and drawn out, with absolutely no suspense to keep the readers interest. King's format of organizing the beginning of each chapter with baseball ""Lingo"" was very inventive. However, I did fine that forcing myself to finish reading his novel was close to a self-torturing act. Just ask my husband."
2,Not one of Kings best...,"okay i LOVE stephen king.. but this book stinks. It totally goes nowhere fast..not too much of a point to it.I can honestly say, that I have loved all the of the reast of the books I have read by him."
2,"Average story, Zero value","Stephen King's attempt at blending sports with ""horror"" is a failed one. This book is all just suggestion. It is just a big obsessive thought of this lost little girl who is only having an argument with her id (Fruedian Psychology). The god of death, who is supposedly a huge monster, without giving the ending away, is not that much of a monster after all. He is not even that strong. King also tries to include some theme in his novel. He tries to say that God does not help anybody, and is to busy to answer her prayers. I think Stephen King is running out of ideas. This book was probably more for teenagers than for adults. My advise, don't buy this book. The movie will be better, if they are actually going to make one."
2,Boring and story line moved very slowly.,I am an avid King fan however this book was sort of boring from the start. It was hard to continue reading it at times. The story line seemed not to move to fast. I had a hard time concentrating on the book and pushed myself to finish it. Not the great bizare type of book you expect from Mr. King. Sort of disappointed.
2,Even King has an off day,"A girl wanders away from her family while hiking. She gets lost and through sheer determination trudges through the woods day after day trying to find her way to civilization. At night, she takes comfort in listening to her portable radio that is airing baseball games featuring MLB pitcher Tom Gordon. Eventually, she starts hallucinating and sees Tom Gordon, among other things, manifest himself into her psyche.As a Steven King fan, I can confidently say that The Girl who loved Tom Gordon is not his best work. King has written non horror type stories before and I have found them very enjoyable. This one, however, just didn't do it for me. The story went flat early on and the plot wasn't strong enough to keep the pace. All in all, the story was decent. There were simply too many gaps between points of excitement."
4,I love the Girl who loved Tom Gordon,I found that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon to be a very gripping and heart wrenching book. This novel had me hooked on page one. The detail and the plot were amazing. Stephen King did a great job in painting a mental image of what was going on. I think this book was great. The ending did disapoint me though. I won't give it away but it was not what I expected it to be. But over all I think this novel was a work to be proud of. YOU DID IT AGAIN STEPHEN!
3,Kind of boring,"I read this book from cover to cover on a two day road trip and there were times that talkin to my mother was more interesting. Like all Stephen King books, there is some great imagery in there. But it just doesn't have the edge that his really great books do. Stephen King has proven that he has the ability to write a gripping story even though there is very little character interaction or scenery change (see Gerald's Game) but it just didn't happen in this book."
4,An Object Lesson for Fiction Writers,"I teach fiction in Manhattan. My students are very sophisticated, and they will only reluctantly admit they read Stephen King (who absolutely influenced me--I read all his books up until the time I was in 9th Grade). That's too bad. This story is so well told, and King's sense of plot is so muscular that it chugs along even when parts of it don't quite make sense. (It seems unlikely to me, for example, that the novel's protagonist, Trisha, would make the connections and leaps that she does; would a 9-year-old realize, for example, that it was the water that made her sick?) The ending is a bit confusing, thematically. We didn't realize that Trisha identified so strongly with the absent father, so the exclusion of the mother in that final epiphany feels a bit off. But these are minor quibbles. The conflict and character development in this book are so strong that every novellist wannabe should check it out. They'll probably enjoy the trip, too."
3,Tame,"I wonder if Mr. King was publishing this today (2011) if it might not be tougher, scarier, more troubling. I wonder if the last 11 years of ""young adult"" books might not have changed the overall tenor of this story. Maybe not. As it is, ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" feels flat. I was never too concerned for Trisha McFarland. Good story. Interesting premise. Fairly tame. Fairly? Check that: very."
5,Great,King IS getting better as he gets older. He truly is a great writer. The wasp-priest was creepy as hell! I think this story is all the more scary if you've ever been lost in the woods. I know from experience that it can be a terrifying ordeal. It really is a great book.
3,"If you long for the King of old, Don't","Long time fans, think twice. I have read every work of fiction published by Stephen King/Richard Bachman except for Dark Tower III and Insomnia. This is the first time I felt the material would have been better left unpublished. If refunds were available for dissatisfaction, I would apply. I did read it straight through in one sitting, but that is more attributable to its length than avid interest."
3,"Entertaining, but not his best","I found this book to be a ""snack."" It had a good premise, and I hated to put it down, but it didn't have the meat of his other books. Another female survivor story, Gerald's Game, had more tension and scary parts. King has done better in the past, and will do better in the future, but I don't rate this one as one of his best. The obligatory monster was lukewarm and rather silly. Other villians, such as Flagg, It, and the necrophiliac in Gerald's Game, were better fleshed out. I'll keep it on my shelf but I won't be rereading it anytime soon. With King's talent, he doesn't have to write a book just to have one in the bookstore, and I'm a little disappointed in this effort."
4,Was suprized....,"..that I enjoyed this book as much as I did. Although the story line seemed to be pretty simple,it kept me interested & wanting to continue reading. I'd recommend this one."
2,Don't waste your money,By far the slowest King book I've ever read. Too much about baseball and not enough about the wilderness. PREDICTABLE
2,"Good writing, but where's the story?","I thought the writing itself was very, very good. But although the little girl seems to be a cute kid ...... where's the rest of the story? In the end, there just wasn't any point to the whole experience - and certainly no reason to read it."
2,Tom Gordon couldn't get to third base.,"Tom Gordon. Who? I'm not a baseball fan. That aside, I always enjoy Stephen King's descriptions of people and things. He has a special, sometimes disgusting, knack for describing things that we can understand, but rarely have the ability to adequately put in writing. This book includes wonderful King descriptions; however, I think the story itself falls far short of fascinating. I expected the book to have some climactic moments, it didn't. Scary? No. Looking for a surprise ending? There isn't one. Maybe you must like baseball to appreciate this book? I finished this book and immediately felt compelled to look for the missing pieces. Oh well, I won't give up on Stephen King yet though...Bag of Bones, here I come!"
5,STOP GIVING AWAY THE STORY IN REVIEWS!,"Many of you may not have liked this book, but PLEASE dont give away the story! I now have no purpose to read this, except to finish the book. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
3,"Good, but it wasn't hard to put the book down","Usually when I buy a Stephen King novel, I can't put it down. But this book lacked his usual suspense and imagination. The plot was shallow and somewhat predictable. It's lacks the usual King magic."
3,Some Decent Entertainment,"Not as chilling as really good Stephen King, but still okay enough to while away a couple of evenings with. Try to get it from the library if you can, you'll only want to read it once."
4,Realistic terror!,"Just as in the Dolores Claiborne and Misery, this is a captivating book that really shakes the readers attention. This could happen to anyone! The feelings of the main character were explained so vividly that I found myself screaming with her, feeling the bumps with every fall and getting caught up in her daydreams as Tom Gordon walked with her in the woods.... I can't wait to see if they make this into a movie!"
4,Once Again.....,"No one really reads a Stephen King novel, they become a Stephen King novel. His ability to make us feel as if we are in the middle of the woods...lost, alone, and nine years old is astounding. Although there was no ""evil"" in this book it was immensely gripping and in it's own way terrifying. The only thing I did not like was the title. Linda"
4,Leave it to King!,"Leave it to Stephen King to make something as mundane as a walk in the woods into a heart thumping adventure. As usual, his characterizations and dead-on descriptions have you feeling like you know Trisha and are there with her, lost in the deep woods of Maine. Her trip through the swamp was heart wrenching and her determination so admirable that I found myself pulling for her as though she were my own daughter. This is not a very long book, which must have been King's goal. Otherwise, I think he could have had some fun with the storyline of Trisha's family as they await her fate. Instead, he remains focused on the heroine as only King can focus. I couldn't wait to see how this book ended, and I wasn't disappointed as the last chapter unfolds. I think non-hikers would probably like this book less than those of us who can relate to following a trail through beautiful, and sometimes eerie, woods and imagine what being lost there might be like. Completely terrifying!"
3,"I've read better, but not much.","This is definately worth the read, but in my opinion it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, nor as good as everyone told me it was.Girl gets lost in the woods, after a few days she starts having dellusions, thinks ""something"" (don't want to give too much away) is following her, sees Tom Gordon (pro ball player) who helps her find her way.It's a fairly short book so you can probably finish it in a few nights."
3,Lost in the woods?,"I have always taken King's books seriously, so this attempt to write a ""serious book"" confuses me. Unfortunately, King has to live with the stigma of sub-literature that people put on just about any genre piece. This terrific novel by any other standards, did not hold up for me when compared to other King greats. There are moments of pure brilliance - in fact, page 100 to the end are terrific. Trisha's family history is very realized, as are her friends, but sometimes the voice of Trisha wavers. Sometimes she's too adult, sometimes too childish. The cacophony of her terrible mistakes clashed against her moments of insight are difficult to believe. Mostly, there are moments where we are wandering in the woods with her, and unfortunately, are also lost and a little bored."
2,"This book was slow, and weak.","Not one of his bests....thank god! It was a very slow, weak, boring, ...I could go on an on! I thikn he shoudl stick to his usual frightening detailed books..this just didn't compare!"
1,"Like the Red Sox, the reader loses again....","Since the postcript mentions that this story of a young girl's trek through unknown woods was written in Florida, one can assume that it was hurriedly scribbled on the backs of notescrap after an inspired romp through the sports pages while sitting on the beach. I'm going to read this again (when I can find 30 minutes)just to make a true count of the falling down/bodily function/bug swatting/gurgling stream references. Stephen King - meet Thomas Harris. Please!!"
3,"Well told story, but really not in King's TOP 10...","I've read quite a few of King's greatest books and this one is very different. First, it is a short novel, so even if you don't love it you may get through it quickly (like I did...).Second, it is not really scary, the story seems endless and after 150 pages I was tired of the Tom Gordon intrigue. So, why is it not that bad ?!? Well, the main character (Trisha, a little girl lost in the woods) is very attaching and the story is well told by King. The description of the woods and Trisha's feelings is intense and keeps you turning the pages.So, if you like King's long descriptions and you are in for a short relax read, this book is still a good choice."
2,No Fall Classic,"King is still sharp, yes, but what is young Trisha thinking? Clearly this heroine has misplaced loyalties. She clings desperately to Gordon and the 43 straight he saved last season, but what of the post-season, Trisha? Where was that string against the hated Cleveland Indians? Where's the promised land? The fact that the streak survived another clumsy Boston October doesn't make ME feel any better, young lady. YOU need to reacquaint yourself with what it means to be a winner. The Sox don't need this kind of pre-playoff nostalgia. The ghost of Babe Ruth still haunts Fenway. Two stars."
1,The Guy Who Used to Love Stephen King,"If you have expectations of reading Stephen King as you once loved him, forget this one. The old and middle writings of King were my cup of tea! Then he changed. I no longer have any desire to finish the Dark Tower series (apparently nor does he) and what his current writing has become no longer interests me. This book deals with a nine-year-old who gets lost in the woods. Yeah, and... And that's the point. There's not anything to it. Skip this one."
2,DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE,I just cant understand why so many people pretend to likethisnovel. Stephen King has written many good books and a few greatones. But he has also written plenty of bad ones. Bt he is human and sometimes just does not deliver. If this book had been written by Michael Nobody everyone would have a differnt opponion of this book. IT IS VERY BORING.There is nothing scarry about this book. And it is not very entertaining. Very little happens over the course of 260 pages. I can understand some people liking the book but it just is not very good. But I I give it an extra star out of sympathy. END
2,Couldn't get into this book...,"I usually like everything Stephen King pumps out of his book writing mill...but occasionally one of his books just doesn't catch my attention. I found this book very hard to get into, it was extremely slow and I didn't even finish. My husband read it and said it does get better in the second half of the book but he agreed it was hard to get into the storyline."
5,Lost...,"Trisha McFarland is lost in the woods and I found myself lost in the pages of this book. When I started reading The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I didn't stop until I was done. Stephen King puts the reader into his characters like no other and this is one of the best I've read. I haven't read a lot of King's works, but I haven't read a bad one yet. I found myself becoming Trisha, feeling, seeing, and smelling what see did. I cared for her and worried about her (something I don't do very often).To those who complained about its size, I would just like to say that it's the same as complaining about a movie being too long. A story is told in a determined amount of time. No more and no less... Stephen King transported me into Trisha for a wild, suspensful trip. All I can say is Bravo!"
2,Boring,This book was too long and boring. I have read other books of Stephen King which are really scary. I found myself anxious to finish it and put it away.
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It's well written, and gets exciting towards the end, but Stephen King takes a long time to get there and being lost in the woods for over a week is inevitably rather repetitive. The plot is negligible."
3,Little girl lost tale almost lost me.,"Make no mistake about it, The Girl that Loved Tom Gordon is a nail biter of a story. I just thought that King stumbled a bit in trying having to have the story both ways, having the threat be both natural and supernatural. Granted this is a ""Stephen King"" story, so gross outs and ghouls are to be expected and welcomed. I just felt that the book was a tad too sketchy in its use of the ghoul and that the scares would have been made more hair raising if a lighter touch had been used. I was however quite amused that this novel's original hardback release coincided with the early theatrical playdates for The Blair Witch Project, another lost in the woods tale with a concept not too dissimilar from King's."
4,Rory's Opinion,"Stephen King's book, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is very good because it gave a good description of the woods, it created a sense of fear, and the ending was satisfying. Throughout the entire book the woods are described, and King tells how the girl, Trisha, felt. ""Trisha was willing to leave sight of the brook if the clenches of trees and tangles of bushes near it got too thick, but she refused to leave the sound of it."" King also created a deep sense of fear. ""You won't even get inbarned because they're never going to find you. You'll die out here, just wander around in these woods until you die."" The ending was satisfying. It was worked in perfectly and the girl survives. I like Stephen King. He has written many great books and this is just one of those that should be a classic."
3,"Didn't Love Tom Gordon, but ...","Although I'm a very loyal SK reader (and will continue to be), I can't give this one high marks. There isn't much suspense, and the ""creepy bits"" we all know and love stay at arms length through most of the story. The plot is rather uneventful, quite frankly.If you're a loyal fan, you *must* read it (you will anyway, right?), but if you're an occasional King reader for suspense, skip it."
2,Not up to par.,"I like Stephen King, but this book was not up to his usual standard. It had the feel of a throwaway effort; maybe he wasn't really in a writing mood. It's a quick read and not boring, just not top-of-the-line King."
1,dissapointing,The book was allright it was very dissapointing for a Stephen King novel. The story was very lame and farfetched. Don't waste your money. Wait till it goes on a bargin book table at you local book stores!
5,Another Goodie!,"I loved this book. I am an avid Stephen King fan and was delighted when I read this book. True, it was not one of his usual ""scare me to death"" stories, but it was indeed captivating. I don't know about you, but as I read about Trisha's ordeal, I really did feel like I was the one lost in the woods. It was hard for me to get beyond all those mosquitos! And, it would have to be just that way if you were truly lost in the deep woods. I found myself pulling for Trisha at every turn. The one thing I couldn't swallow was the fact that Trisha's parents could even sleep at all the night she disappeared. It takes all kinds.Be sure to read this book and enjoy it like I did."
2,P-lease!,"Suddenly, King is churning out his writing. His latest work is a 20 page short story that was extended into a 200 page ""hardback"" for a few more ""greenbacks."" The story has no real plot or even a purpose. A few of the ideas are good in the book but its mainly just plain boring. How many times can he describe the forest to the reader. Its just plants, plants, and more plants. King, stop trying to milk your readers and start producing good fiction again. By the way, Storm of the Century was another ill-conceived flop. If not, you'll turn into just another Dean Koontz and look at him now."
3,Not King's better book but certainly a good one!!,"I was so amazed when I saw a new Stephen King's book while I was wandering in my favourite Bookshop, that I immediately bought it. Come back home I started reading it and found it absolutely good, also if it isn't at BAG OF BONES' levels. I think that it can be inserted in that sort of ""King's theological period"" in which DESPERATION and THE REGULATORS are collocated. In this book King reflects about God and his nature, that is of ""coming on in the bottom of the ninth""; by the original idea of comparing the disadventure of Trisha with a baseball match, King reveals his great ability to mix up different elements with that sort of dissacration that is a constant of his works.....and finally he reveals his deep supporting of the ""Red Sox""!!(sorry for wrong expression but I'm from Italy and my English may be not so good)"
3,It kept my interest and didn't take long to read.,"This book was alright. Not typical Stephen King horror. ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" was sort of like ""The Long Walk"" revisited (written by King as Richard Bachman)."
4,"Red-sox lover gets lost in woods, and uses Tom to keep sane","Little girl, who loves Tom "" Flash"" Gordon get's lost in the woods, and to get through a couple of weeks in the woods she uses an imaginary Tom Gordon to make it through. A must read for Stephen king fans."
4,King continues to evolve in this short novel about surviving,"Although this book is a little different than King's normal style, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the way the story unfolded and looked forward to reading about Tricia next obstacle. However, the three ""gods"" that Tricia sees across the stream played no real role and served no real purpose to the story. The story would have been just as strong without their very strange appearance. I also feel that King either needed to develop the character of the Bear or leave him ""just as a bear."" I didn't understand the significance of him being ""more than a bear."""
2,An underachieving novel.,"I understand the debate among King fans as to whether this lives up to his talent, but having read only IT and THINNER, I prefer to compare this novel to other non-King novels on the market. As such, I just don't believe there was much effort put into writing this one. It seemed like lazy writing. The plot plodded along and some of the phrases left me wondering if he could have done better. Not bad, but not great...."
5,Stephen King's best novel,"I've read about 10 of Stephen King's novels, and this one is my favorite. This riveting story of survival is scarier than most of his books dealing with the supernatural. The main character, a 9 year-old girl, comes alive in this great little novel. I strongly recommend this to both teens and adults, even those who would never think of reading a Stephen King novel because of his normal genre. If you like scary novels, or books about wilderness survival, you'll love this one. If you have some interest in baseball, it makes this even better."
4,Ageless story told with brilliant illustration.,"Pop-Up Book Version:This story, while often considered a work of juvenile fiction, is quite ageless. It gets at that spongy heart of fear-- where the prospect of being completely lost in a world that has ""teeth"" that it can bite you with anytime it wants to is more than probable. This pop-up book, like the story itself, is also ageless. A wonderfully condensed and brilliantly illustrated book with scores of secret tabs to pull and pop-ups to explore."
5,I loved this book,"I had low expectations when I started reading this book. I got hooked quickly and could not put it down. I loved this book and it's main character. I really cared about what happened to her and had to put the book down and walk away when it took a bad turn. It is not a horror story in the classical sense, it is a horror story for the the parents and brother of the little girl and for the main character finding herself desperately lost in the wilderness. I highly recommend this book."
5,He really lets you know how it feels to be lost in the woods,"I found it so real, every step that she took, from getting even with her brother to the last step. I have taken only about 2000 of those steps but can imagine with Mr. King the rest of the steps. Thank you."
3,King needs to chill,"Stephen King has always been my favorite author; he's always had a clever, if not repetitive, story to tell. Perhaps he's working too hard, though. His latest, ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" is typically King-esque; suspense, other-worldy elements, and of course, a kid in the story. However, the first one hundred pages drag slowly and terribly. Most of the book is a narrative, and very nature-oriented. One would think there would be more action, more brushes with death, no matter how unrealistic (that's never stopped King before), but here we find King (and his character Trisha) going in circles. By the end of this short novel, it is a rather enjoyable read, but not what one expects King to pull off with such a subject at hand. Steve, slow down. Take more time developing your books. But, of course, I'll always read whatever he chooses to write."
2,Didn't really care what happened at the end,"I bought this book because my realtor's name is Tom Gordon and I was selling my house. I like a lot of Stephen King's work, but this one just didn't keep me interested. I did finish the book, so it wasn't awful, but I didn't care about the main character at the end. I could tell there was plenty of research done, and some of it was interesting, but my overall take is that somebody can have my copy. Unfortunately, the realtor wouldn't take the book off my hands!"
2,Disappointing,"This one reads as if someone put a stopwatch on King & said, ""You have 24 hours to write a story. Setting: girl lost in the woods. Ready, GO!"" 24 hours later, this is what we get. Hard to believe there are so many errors in a piece this short. It is still an engaging read -- Steve can spin a yarn. The other thing that kept me going was the knowledge, gained from reading King for almost 20 years now, that he has been known to kill off the kid and end the story tragically (see Cujo). That knowledge left the outcome uncertain, right up to the end. But this is a disappointing work, considering that King had gotten back to producing at least a few worthwhile pieces (Green Mile, Desperation, Storm of the Century) in the past few years after years of complete crap (Insomnia, Delores Claiborne, Gerald's Game)."
3,"The book was 'aw-right', but by no means among King's best.","The book is a 'must read' for Stephen King fans, simply because that's what makes them fans -- they absorb it all no matter what! Nothing new here though folks, the standard 'SK format' minus true demonic entities (instead we got the boogey man). King also seems to think that African Americans aren't fans (ergo, the 'Sambo' analogies). I've been a King junkie since his beginning (plunking down my bucks on the hardbacks only) and he won me over as a fan with the 'Stand', where 'Good' was personified via a little old black woman. Move on Stephen, evolve, not regress!"
4,Atypical King -- not one of his best but a good read,"Although it is not the usual Stephen King book, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is not without its pleasures. Trisha is a spunky young heroine; you can't help but care about her. ""Supernatural"" aspects of the story are limited but effective. The ending is a little bit of a downer, as I would have preferred some more resolution. I think the readers who panned this book were expecting a Carrie or a Pet Sematary; to me it's more like Gerald's Game or Misery. Incidentally, I am also awaiting the next episode of The Dark Tower."
3,101 Ways To Torture A Child In The Woods by Stephen King,"Again King evolves as a writer, but his subject matter and the thoughts he puts in the mind of a nine-year-old child just do not ring true. A good couple of hours diversion, ""The Girl Who Loved Tome Gordon"" should not be a starting place for new King readers. That spot should be reserved for ""The Shining"" or ""Salems Lot"". King is, well, King, and so he is here. However, the novella feel of the book coupled with the almost ""deja-vu"" of other books I have read, made for a flat experience."
2,"OH WHERE, OH WHERE HAS MY STEPHEN KING GONE","What happend to Stephen King when Stephen King was good. Pet Sematary: now that was a great King book. The Bachman Books are hard to beat. Rose Madder was excellent. But then comes Bag of Bones and this. King has lost his old charm and writing skill in the persuit of something more literary, and it is causing me to stick with his old stuff and other authors. The only reason I finished this book was that I listened to it on audio, and even then it was a struggle. I am a fan of Stephen King, not Jack London. ... it belongs in Young Adult Adventure. Well, I guess I am left to reading the old King and hoping that some day he'll come back in his former glory."
2,The woman who was disappointed,"I haven't read a lot of Stephen King's books, but from the few I have read, I can honestly say he's capable of better than this.(I believe even Mr King admitted as much.)There is very little character development, which gives one little reason to care if Trisha escapes the woods, in fact you pretty much know she will."
3,Lost in woods?,"Since Insomnia, Stephen King's works are getting less and less complicated, gradually losing from the once-beautiful style and mood. Horror through a child's eye have always been the best area he writes in, yet this one, although it is not as disastrous as Rose Madder, is quite below his average. The plot is very simple, and, personally speaking, reeks too much of the Blair Witch Project to me. I admit that it is an easy and entertaining read, butn if you are a fan of his old ones like It or The Stand, keep away from this, it will only feel like a knife in the back."
3,"Good read for the pool, but not much substance","This was definitely not King's greatest work. As a mother of an almost-9-year-old, I found King's description of Trisha's thoughts too far off base. Additionally, I didn't buy that a 9-year-old would do the things King has her doing. Nevertheless, I was intrigued with finding out how it ended."
5,MORE GORINESS THAN HORROR,"This book by Stephen King is extraordinary, I especially love the detail put into the plot. The ideas are great and the suspence is thrilling. It's imposible to put this book down. Definitally worth a re-read! Once you're done the book, don't throw it away, you're sure to come back to it another time."
3,Very enjoyable,"Being a hiker, and a Stephen King fan, I started reading this in the bookstore and couldn't turn away. The story is not that unique, but King's writing makes it uniquely true-to-life. The sub-plots are very familiar and will have you thinking that King's knows the reader's thoughts."
2,An entertaining disappointment,"As a huge and long-time Stephen King fan, my first warning was the shortness of this book. Stephen King books are generally in excess of 400 pages, and this is a lightweight in comparison. Although some of his short books are excellent, such as Misery or Gerald's Game, I have found most of them to also be short of his standard.I found myself caught up in the story, as always with this author, with the vivid imagery and excellent character insight drawing me into the novel. I felt a real sympathy for the girl child heroine, and her thoughts rang true. However, I was left with a feeling of incompleteness. Perhaps he had to make a deadline so did not flesh out the story as he normally would have.If you're a big King fan, go ahead and get this book, but if you're looking for true horror or suspense, this does not deliver it."
3,Not King's best work,"I am a huge Stephen King fan, and have loved every book of his that I have read. And i was very excited to read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, as I have heard that it was one of his best works, but I has hugely disappointed. As I was reading I kept on waiting for the book to get better or the scary part to happen, and it never did. Don't get me wrong the book is very well written and it has it moments, but they a far and few in between. Please read this book because I am sure that a lot of people will disagree with my opinion, and you may to, and I do not want to ruin a book for anybody. I cannot wait though to read another Stephen King book, as I know the next one will be better and more suited for me."
4,Ever wade through an endless swamp with flies eating you?,"Well, if not, you should read this book and see how heroic Trisha is. Trisha is a 9-year-old with an active imagination, but if you've ever been lost in the woods, her imagined monsters may seem just a bit more real to you. By the way, the Tom Gordon reference alludes to Trish's facsination with a professional baseball player. Fortunately she go lost in the woods while carrying a radio in her backpack, and despite being miles from civilization, she can still listen to baseball games at night. These keep her company, and they also help her stay connected to her dad, as Trisha and her dad share baseball as a common interest."
5,One of my favorite S. King novels,"This is one of my all time favorite of Stephen King's novels. Everyone should read it.I read it many years ago but still remember how much I enjoyed it. I don't always enjoy his novels, but this is one I kept to re-read."
5,1st time reading King...,"This is my first time reading Stephen King and I can honestly say that I was very impressed. This story is about a 9 year od girl named Tricia who gets lost in the woods for nine days.I was drawn into this story very quickly and as strange as this may sound; I became attached to Tricia and found myself not wanting to put the book down because I didn't want to 'leave her', lol. I also cringed when she was sick, shuddered when she ate a raw fish and was so proud of her when her survival instincts kicked in. It was an amazing story of perserverance and survival and I just loved it. Even though this wasn't 'horror' per sae, I still felt fear for her in the sense that this could really happen and the building fear that something was tracking her in the woods...waiting.The only thing I didn't like was that for a 9 year old she uses some pretty strong language( I guess I would too under the same circumstances, though). Excellent read, well worth 5 stars in my opinion!"
4,Really Good Quick Read,Im all for short books(not to short) but once in a while its nice to have a GOOD book that doesnt take to long to read.Fast paced and well told.Very detailed which I love.It took me to the places in the book.Thats what books are supposed to do!
5,One of Stephen Kings best,"Stephen king has written many great books, but I think The GirlWho Loved Tom Gorden is one of his best.This book takes you through the book like you were there with her, such good details. This book is about a girl who goes on a camping trip. When she finds out she has to go to the bathroom, she wanders off into the wilderness.If you are looking for a person vs.nature book, I would certainly recommend this book. All this girl has is her walkman to listen to while a massive beast hunts her, follows her every move. She gets the baseball games tuned in on her walkman and gets to listen to he favorite player play, Tom Gorden. She sees him, he is there with her suddenly. Can she survive with this all too real beast in the wild? Let Stephen king take you on an adventure you will never forget. I would recommend this book for 14 years and older."
3,Not his usual stuff,This book is a departure from Stephen's King regular style. I am not a baseball fan and did not particularly love this book. I love Stephen King but I thought this writing experiment was rather dull and lacked a lot of the imagination in his other books.
4,OK,"even though i was disappointed when i realized that this book is a pshycological thriller and not Kings classic horror and bone-chilling books i got over it fast because this is a good book. Im glad that King kept it short and got straight into the plot, unlike many other of his books where he takes 200 pages to introduce to you his characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book up until the ending because after King took you to such peaks and realizations about Trisha's state of mind i would have preferred a more appropriate ending or way in which the outcome occured, but then again who am i to critic King, a master writer? I would recommend this book because King kind of toys with Trisha's mind, and the readers."
4,"Blair Witch Project, anyone???","I was a third of the way through this book and mentioned to my roommate that I wondered if the people who had made the Blair Witch Project had read the book. I love King's older stuff and I loved this book, too. He proves that you don't have to have goblin's and deamons jumping out and drinking human blood every other page in order to ratchet up the reader's fear. Patricia's desperation and degeneration as the days of her trek continue were very believeable and very frightening. The one thing I didn't particulary like was the ""God of the Lost"". It felt as though he just through this supernatural element in as a bone to all those people he knew were going to be whining because it wasn't another ""Salem's Lot"". All in all a good book and a scary read."
1,Is this Stephen King?,"If you have read the other books by King, then you don't find his ability to create a 'cosy, creepy' athmosphere in this book. Also there are no characters he has elaborated (not even the girl). Disappointing."
1,It was Stephen King?,I finished to read this book yesterday... 2 days after I bought it... I found it like a tale for teen-agers! There was the King's style but... not like his old great titles!
1,undeniably disapointing,As most of King's latest novels (excluding The Green Mile) this book sounded promising but just didn't deliver. I wasn't the least bit frightened. As a matter of fact I kept reading in hopes of at least feeling a slight chill in the air...nothing.
1,The Koran would be more scarey!,"I buy every book King writes looking for his old self. I read all his old books and had sleepless nights, not with this one. This is the only book he wrote that I did not finish. It should also be the first book that Amazon,com offers people that buy it their money back."
1,A Stephen King failure!,"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is without doubt a failure. The 10 year old girls and boys who read it might find it enjoyable; however, in my opinion, it wasn't worth the paper it was written on. Give me a refund!!!"
1,A GOOD WRITER ONLY HAS ONE JOB...,"Make me care and Stephen you failed. I couldn't get past page four and had no qualms about giving up and closing the book forever.Different strokes for different folks, but I remember when I could not put your books down...a long time ago I know, but you got me longing for the good old days."
3,Good,The girl who loved Tom Gordon is a story about a young girl named Trisha. She goes hiking with her Mom and her brother which argued a lot with each other about a lot of things then wanting to have a break and needing to answer a nature's call Trisha gets seperated from them but she can not find her way back. She's lost in the bush.I am a huge Stephen King fan but this one wasn't what I have expected. OK. At least 95% of the plot was regarding Trisha - it almost seemed that King forgot with whom did she go hiking!I struggled but I still made it to the last page when Trisha is finally found.
2,Aburrido,"Empece a leer este libro con la esperanza de verme sumido en los placeres que solo el sentir miedo nos da. Sin embargo, al pasar las paginas me vi envuelto en una historia para colegiales; un tanto estupida. Es un libro aburridisimo.EL CRITICO LATINO"
2,Bad Ending,"When you pick up the book and read the first page, it looks like a pretty good book. You keep reading and like it, it builds up to an ending,suspense,suspense,suspense, stupidity.It is the worst ending Stephen King has ever written. It seems a good book about a girl lost in the woods, with something after her, it gets you excited about the ending, then disappoints you. I don't reccomend it at all, just skip it."
3,"Could have been better, but still worthy of a read!","This book started strong, lagged in the middle, then finished on a pretty high note. I did enjoy the story and how it was told by King, but it was just missing something needed to be a great survival story. It was not as scary as most King novels, but it had a few moments of fear. I recommend this story for a good short read, if you have nothing else to do."
4,Realistically creepy,"A great one by Stephen King. It was sweet and to the point not all long and drawn out like King's books often are. I read it in one day and loved it. Trisha, a little girl lost in the woods off the Appalachian Trail, has to learn survival while trying to find a way out of the forest. Her encounters are spooky and her thoughts terrifying. It is a great and exciting read!"
3,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS??,"From time to time, King write something that the line between horror and a ""normal"" book is very thin. This is one of then, not a horror story (but there is a evil entity), is more like him, telling us how some parents are so self-centerd that they won't notice until way too late that their children are missing or anything like that. No gore, no scares, only the suspense of whether the girl lifes or dies (which i won't tell, so you go read it). Not a bad book, yet not one of his best work. What it lacks in horror made up in impressive descriptions and suspense. Buy it so you can have the King collection."
4,tom...whoa,"I thought this book was pretty spiffy. It was the first book since I've started my binge of reading that I was actually captivated by it. I wasn't paying attention to page numbers or anything else going on in the world. And I used to love it when there was lots of dialoge especially when the author dished it out well...but this book barely had any and I couldn't have made it better. The only downside to it was the ending. Since the book was building up to be so good I thought the ending would be like ""KABLAMO!"" but it was just like ""boom"". yeah that's all"
1,King continues to disappoint. But what else is new.,"The man writes like it's an obligation (which, contractually, it probably is). Perhaps if we stopped buying his drivel (face it, he's written nothing since The Shining/Stand/Salem's Lot era), perhaps he would be content to sit down and write one good novel ever two years or so rather than one bad one ever four months. And with this latest...man, finishing his stuff lately is a chore. Little trisha isn't the only one lost in this ""novel."" Forget it. Wait for the TV movie. And then don't watch it, either."
2,Typical King. Slow and poorly written.,It is hard to believe that this man has been so successful. This is the fourth book I've read by King and (of those four) only The Green Mile was any good. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is slow moving and dull. One more thing. The Red Sox catcher is Jason VARITEK.
2,The Thrill is Gone,"I just love reading King, I think 90% of what he's written is pure genius, but this one falls short on many levels. No excitement, no thrill, not much of a plot either. Maybe this might satisfy juveniles, I don't know. I didn't find the young heroine particularly interesting, although she is clever enough to stay alive. But the book died somewhere early on. I can't say pass this one by since King is a great writer and there's always something to admire in how he writes, but not all his stories are worth the energy to read. I admit I like King's crazed psychopaths best, but I also appreciate his tamer stuff, usually. Not this time."
2,"Great storytelling and chapter titles, lousy story","This was a great disappointment. This had a lot of posibilities. There was no supernatural, unless you consider Trisha's imagination. Placing yourself in her situation, it was frightening. However why didn't Trisha observe the first rule taught to all who are lost in the woods: ""hug a tree."" After all she did learn some survival techniques from school and her mother."
2,Please Stephen go back to writing horror.,"This is another example of Stephen King writing well but not writing his genre. The writing is first rate and the characters are good but the story was certainly not up to snuff. So I say again, PLEASE STEPHEN KING GO BACK TO WRITING HORROR!"
1,TEDIOUS AND BORING,I got tired of the whole thing after 50 pages of nothing but a lost girl walking in the woods
2,A Dull Cliche,"A young girl is lost in the woods. Period. A reader waiting for that great Stephen King plot twist or suspense will be utterly disappointed. King's book starts out with an intriguing first chapter, but everything afterwards is a tedious account of Tricia's prolonged nature walk. No surpises here, but plenty of lost-in-the-woods cliches."
4,Excellent!,SK should write more books like this one. Just enough suspense to keep you interested with not too much horror and gore.
3,good but where is the next Dark Tower?,"This was a good, quick read. It wasn't his best(IT), but certainly not his worst(Dolores Claiborne). It would probably be a good book for a teenager who wants to read King. I'm waiting patiently for the next book in the Dark Tower series to be published. Hopefully I won't have to wait as long as I did for Wizard and Glass."
1,AWFUL,"This book was a waste of time and money!There was no character development, the story was weak and predictable."
1,A Big Disappointment,I was really disappointed!!! I'm a 13 year old girl who has read many Stephen King books and I think he is an excellent writer. This book didn't even compare on my scale to other books such as Salems Lot. It was genuinly not scary at all to me. I was so bored with the book by page 100 but I thought it might get etter so I stuck with it. I was wrong.
4,"Not typical King, but a very good read","I finished this book a couple of nights ago and I found it to be wonderfully written and with a very good story line. This is not typical King, it does not have the intense shock value of books like ""The Regulaters"" or ""Pet semetery"" {""Pet Semetery"" being my favorite King book} I can understand how some found the book slow and lacking in the shock department, I will admit that the girl acts and thinks in a way that is older then a nine year old but this is a great read non the less. If you are new to King, check out ""Pet Semetery"" and ""Cujo"" before you read this one and I think you will be able to enjoy it more."
4,Through the open woods.,"If you read ""The girl who loved Tom Gordon"" you will be awake the whole time. It's not like those little, stupid, small booksthat make you go to sleep. You never know what is coming next, you'll be surprised. This book is about a girl who goes with her mom and brother Pete, on awalking trail. Mom and Pete are always fighting and were at it again. Trisha(the girl)had to go pee and couldn't get her moms attiention. She goes off the trail and goes pee. She gets lost and cant find her way. To find out what happens read the book. I rate this book a 4."
3,Better than...,"I found that The Girl That Loved Tom Gordon was very similar plot-wise to Gerald's Game. I do think that TGTLTG was a much better telling of the story though. Even though the plot is pretty straight-forward and predictable it kept me wanting to continue reading. The ending was kind of abrupt, I was hoping for ""Extra Innings"" :) All in all a suprisingly good effort for a re-hashed plot. In contrast I think I gave Gerald's Game one star."
3,the girl who loved tom gordon,"this book is about a little girl who was walking on a trail and wandered off into the woods.she got lost and she did some pretty impossible stuff to survive out in the wilderness.stephen king said that this book was supposed to be scary and it is more into the fantasy section.it would go under scary books,but when people read it they might think that the book is scary.I think if you put yourself in her posistion it would be scary.i did not fall asleep reading it."
5,Teen's book!!,"""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" by Stephen King,is a great book and exspecially great for teenagers. It is an inspiring, exciting, and adventurous book. It is about a girl who gets lost in the woods and is trying to find her way home. She is frightened and the thing that is following her is making it even worse. She doesn't know what the thing is and neither will you if you don't read the book. She is only surviving on her love for Tom Gordon. This is an excellent book and I'm rating it a five star book."
1,ZZZZZ,"First, let me say that I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but I did not like this book. I was utterly bored and couldn't force myself to finish. It was so slow and the story wasn't compelling at all. Such a disappointment after Bag of Bones!!"
5,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"My daughter sent me this book for Christmas. I've been a Stephen King fan for years but had stopped reading his books because I thought he was becoming too grim and blood-thirsty. I forced myself to start this book simply because my daughter had sent it to me. I couldn't put it down until I had read the whole thing. Thanks Mr. King for bringing back true suspense. Thanks for not having this book become so gory that I wanted to puke. Thanks for having the girl survive and come out the heroine! I was lost once and had my son lost in the woods and know it can be terrifying; your mind plays tricks on you. Thanks for having the heroine a girl, a young girl, and one who shines -- survives with true grit."
3,"Well writen, but not a classic.","I have been waiting for this book to come out on paperback, an then an opurtunity knox came along. I read it in a couple of days and I liked it. It was well writen and easy to read. The story was great but it had some mistakes. I know that some of you don't want to read about some girl lost in the woods through the whole book. And Stephen King still hasn't gotten back into his original scary novels. I would recommend this book to everyone except for the ones who are fans of Stephen King and want a good scary novel."
2,Wake me up when its over...,"Not since Gerald's game have I been so dissapointed in a King novel. I'm still waiting for something to happen and I've already read every page. Am I missing the point??? I'm not one of those readers who believe that King is only good when writing horror, but this book really failed to reach me. I'm surprised that the other reviews are so glowing. I think King should spend a little more time thinking about his next book before sending this out to his adoring fans."
1,Predictable and childish outing,"A very disappointing novel; the pre-adolescent narration was painful to read, and the plot was predictable on every occasion. Save your money and reread The Shining or Misery."
1,Very disappointing,"I thought Storm of the Century was an aberration but this is way worse. This is a book about abolutely nothing. Nothing at all happens. Red Riding Hood is a better story and I'm truly disappointed in 'The Girl who loved Tom Gordon'. When you compare this book to some of the masterpieces King has written such as 'Salems Lot' and 'The Stand', you realise this was written very quickly and maybe just to fulfill obligations."
4,Interesting and Intelligent Look at Being Lost in the Woods!,"This book exemplifies King's ability to thoroughly develop and interact with his characters. By the end of the book, King had brought me to the point where I really cared about what became of Trisha. The story was not as exciting or imaginative as some of Stephen King's other tales, but the book was still very entertaining considering it was 90% monologue. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a great character novella (also it is easy and entertaining reading for the beach or poolside)."
3,It's certainly worth a try!,"I will admit first of all that I am not a King fanatic, though I do enjoy much of his work. Usually I am turned off by his gratuitous violence which is thankfully not present, and his profanity which is minimal in this book. This was a good story, though the beginning was uninteresting and the end awful. The middle got progressively better until I could feel my own pulse race and I began to truly get jumpy, but one can sense in the last four ""chapters"" the plot winding down. The last two are like King just got sick of it and decided to slop something off to make it appear like an ending. It was horribly contrived, formulaic, melodramatic and boring. But don't let the last few pages discourage you from reading it! Overall it is a pretty good book, short enough to read and finish just in your spare moments, and creepy in some places. I would really I guess give it three and a half stars. Try it, you might like it."
3,Decent at best,"I am not an avid Stephen King reader, so I am not very familiar with his writing style. But, I am however extremely familiar with his movies and I would have to say that if this were made into a movie, it would be pretty juvenile. Most adults wouldn't sit through a two hour or hour and a half film about a child lost in the woods. But, that doesn't mean no one would. This novel/ short story was a nice read. It was slightly suspenseful in a mediocre sort of way. The ending was kind of happy if you like that sort of thing. But, I did thoroughly enjoy all of the characters. Especially Trisha's friend Pepsi (one of those people who like to call people by their last names) and little Trisha's father who calls God the ""Subaudible"", he was the true definition of a character. All in all, it was a fairly good read, just not your typical Stephen King."
3,O.K But not Great....,"I have read a lot of stephen king books and the other day i saw this one at the store so i thought that i would pick it up i didnt really like it that much, there was not a lot going on like in most Stephen King novels. Another thing was that this book was not scary at all, i dont think it was meant to be a thriller but all the critics are saying it is scary, i didnt see any scary parts in it at all. so if you want to get scared dont read this book.But if you do want to get scared readSalems lot, also by King Strangers, By dean Koontz Red Dragon, by Thomas Harris"
4,"Harkens to ""Gerald's Game"" but without the tedium...","King has an incredible talent with his characters. The young girl in this story is a well-developed character. Though young, she is not uninteresting to an adult reader. The plot line is realistic, and King's ending is more evolved from his earlier novels where the line between reality and imagination was bold and crisp. Here, he has blurred the distinction to such a degree that the reader is left with a satisfying feeling that the heroine was living a story that nobody would believe--though the reader does.Ok, it might have had a few paragraphs here and there which dragged a bit, and that is why I offer four stars rather than five. I likened it to a more interesting ""Gerald's Game"" (which in my opinion was a huge disappointment), but truly, it also blends the feelings of ""The Body,"" and even, perhaps ""Bag of Bones;"" offering that brooding, Maine-woods feeling I always get from a King novel."
5,I always fall in love,"Whatever I might think of the storyline,(which was awesome) I always fall in love with Mr. King's characters. This little girl becomes so real, I expected to see her playing with my kids in the back yard.I remember growing up on a farm, surrounded by acres upon acres of woods. I would often go into the woods by myself, and pretend that I was being hunted by a T-Rex, or a monster of some kind. This book gave me such a feeling of deja-vu, it took me a couple of days to shake it off.Want to be a kid again? Read this book."
4,Great Summer Reading - Scarey too!,"I am fascinated by the readers who call themselves King fans and yet cry for the old stuff. King has grown and so should his so called ""fans"". The book was very well written, very descriptive and the characters charming. Except for the Boogy Man. Loved the baseball aspect. I also thought the book was scarey in parts. I was reading alone in the house at night and a couple of times had to put the book down, it brought out things that go bump. A must read! Thanks Mr. King!"
4,Sweet,"I've read many reviews by King fans who are not happy with this book. Can it be that you are not Red Sox fans? Can it be that you don't understand what King was going for in this book? It does not all have to be action, horror, monsters or fear. This is the story of a lost girl who perseveres and survives. She has a hero who inspires her and after a few days, lives with her in her hungered mind. I loved this book. I think that King is exploring other avenues with great success."
4,"Quick, good read",This was my first Stephen King book which is probably why I liked it (not having any of his other books to compare it to). I was drawn into the story and felt the pain Trisha went through as she found herself lost in the woods. I thought her feelings were totally realistic - one minute she was feeling extremely satisfied and content with feeling full for the first time in her life and then she was having a screaming temper tantrum wanting to get out the woods immediately. I might have to try another King book and see what I think
2,This Book Was Not Even Scary,"This is one of the worst Stephen King books I've ever read. It wasn't even scary and it took me two weeks to read it. If it was better I could have read it in two days. This book did not keep me on the edge of my seat, and I would never reccommend this book to anyone."
2,The worst book ever by Stephen King,"No doubt this is the worst book by Stephen King after Geralds Game. I forced very hard to read this book but after 200 pages, once again: 200 pages I dont found any suspenseful paragraph even words! Dont waste your money buying this book. Except you are a teenagers who love adventure genre (lonewolf,etc.) and not like a disturbing book, like IT, PetSemetary, THe Shining,etc. If you like to comment this review or just want to discuss with me about SK e-mail me at: indopsycho@yahoo.com"
1,Horror? I don't think so.,"This book should not be in the Hot Horror section of Stephen King's novels. There is nothing horrific in it. It's about a little girl lost in the woods, period. I kept waiting for something to happen. It's a good thing I was listening to it on a CD when I exercise and just kept on listening until I was finished, otherwise it would have been one of those books you get a few chapters into and never open it again."
1,A blown save opportunity,"The premise of King's book is too good: a young girl lost in the woods, her furtive imagination going wild as she tries to find her way out. Unfortunately, the actual story is about as compelling as watching a 3 day cricket match. Who knows if King could have written it in a way to hold my attention, but as it stands, the story is dullsville. The best moments are when our heroine talks to Tom Gordon, but those are far and few between. Most of the book is written in a rather sophomoric way and many of the events in the story make you want to roll your eyes. A nice payoff at the end may have redeemed the book, sort of like a closer coming in in the ninth to save a losing game. But alas, this one will have to go in the ""L"" column."
4,"Haunting, visoinary and suspenceful!","The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon, is a truly haunting and all to believable book. Even though there is an evil lurking around it is still a truly wonderful adventure book. It was so good as an adventure/survival book that I didn't want ti to become the usual Stephen King book with some sort of evil lurking around.Trisha Gets lost in the words and for the first day she thinks that she will just find her mom and brother again but she dosn't. So she decides to Ration the food, but she didn't do it enough so she runs out of it in two days and has to begin eating berries and drinking creek water.The Girl who Loves tom gordon is an absolutly brilliant visionary tale, it is well written and very colorful, a true treat that is brilliant, but a little to much of the same Stephen King to be his best."
4,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was a very good book. I am not the type of person who likes to read a lot, and I could not put it down the entire time. The book was about a young girl, named Trisha, who lived with her brother and mother and rarely saw her father, because her parents were seperated. Her mother wanted to try to keep the family together, so she planned a camping trip with her kids. The brother and mother fought the entire time, and so Trisha could not stand it anymore and decided to take a walk in the forest, just to get away from things. She ended up walking to far into the woods and could not figure out how to get back to her family. You should read the book to find out how she survives, or if she even does. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants some ""easy"", yet enjoyable reading, that won't let you put the book down."
3,Pretty Good,"Young Trisha McFarland is put through the test of her young life while on what started out as a six-mile hike on the Maine-NH branch of the Appalachian Trail. Mom's been difficult since the divorce and Trisha's older brother Pete hasn't been much better. Trying to escape their constant arguing, Trisha allows herself to fall a little behind, but wanders off the path, takes a wrong turn and falls deeper into the woods, finding herself completely lost.Trisha's Boston Red Sox hero, number 36, relief pitcher Tom Gordon, helps comfort her as she catches a couple games on her Walkman and through her own vivid imagination. A story of a child's terror, her faith and her love of the ""game.""A pretty good story that really held my interest. Growing up just south of Boston, I really enjoyed all the Red Sox talk."
1,Yawn...what a bore!,"I borrowed this audiobook from a relative and found it to be so boring that I had to give it back without finishing the story. From what I can tell, the plot consists of a mother, daughter, and son who fight constantly yet end up going on a hiking trip. This trip is supposed to consist of some quality family time, but ends up in another mother/son fight. In the middle of all the fighting, the daughter (Trisha) ends up stopping to go pee in the woods, which ends up with her getting seperated from her family. And the rest of the story is about her being scared and lost in the woods. It just wasn't very interesting to hear about how scared she was and how she couldn't find her way back to her family. There wasn't a scary twist to it...just a girl lost in the woods."
3,King Fan,"I have been a fan of SK forever! Die hard fans like myself will read it out of loyality to THE MAN, but this book, although suspenseful, was not the edge of my seat page turner of old. SK is taking a turn toward the philosophical and spiritual as he gets older. This book like many of the other new ones is missing the EDGE, that used to keep me up after the lights went out wondering if just reading created the magic necessary to have his creatures come to life and be in my closet. I'll keep reading, but I miss the old SK. For folks who are new to his writing, begin here and work your way back through the years to the REALLY GOOD STUFF! This is a good intro the the pyschological terror that has made SK famous."
3,Definitely different,"I can't say that this was bad, but it wasn't especially good either. I think that's because I'm really expecting something scary, something like Carrie or some of his other books. This reminded me of Cujo, I think that it's just too real...too possible. I really liked the idea about walking with Tom Gordon and being followed by the God of the Lost though."
5,awesome,this book came to me in great shape almost new looking and arrived very quickly im very happy with this order!!!!
3,Not one of King's best,"This is a great book for a quick read, and does effectively capture a very common fear: getting lost in the woods and being stalked by a giant, unknown creature. This probably would have been better as a short story, but King did a great job pulling you in and relating with the main character. Most people who have read some of King's other works will probably not enjoy this that much, but this is tame enough that some younger readers (teens) would probably enjoy it quite a bit."
2,"Is it time for Stephen King to ""take a hike?""","Another over-hyped disappointing read by S.K. The ""being"" stalking the girl in the woods could have been so much more chilling..remember Cujo? I think Trish needed some more harrowing adventures on her trek and more physical obstacles to overcome. The story plodded tiredly along, just like Trish."
3,Not a typical S.King book.,"I thought the book was good, but not typical King style. It could have been more frightening, and it was drawn out a bit. But I did enjoy spending time with Patricia."
2,Ho Hum for the most part,"I can only hope that Mr. King wrote this to make a few bucks until he finishes the next Dark Tower series! I listened to the 4 CD version of this book and after CD #1 and #2, I had to look at the author to make sure it was Stephen King. The last section was great but hardly worth wading through the first 3/4th's of it."
1,Collectors value only,"Well, the last few King works have been less than appealing. This one in particular takes a new low...boring. It was an easy read, but what horror is it to us (presumeably adults) that a little girl is lost in the woods. I would have liked to have read more about what was going on with the family of the little girl during her misadventure. This one is best left to the collectors (myself included). Please Steve, more horror like what I read in 'IT', 'CUJO', 'SALEM'S LOT', etc."
4,"Good book, but I wanted more.","This was truly a great book that amazed me because it certainly wasn't his usual work. It kept me interested, but I wish it was a bit longer! I can't believe it ended when it did. There were a few situations that weren't developed enough (caller with misleading info about Trisha). Otherwise, I really liked it. Suspenseful, and exciting, no doubt!!"
2,This is a book for the younger set.,"I think this book should have been marketed or labeled to the correct readers, 15 and under. This was pretty tame, pretty lame and just plain boring."
3,Not as Good as I thought he was,"This was the first Stephen King book I read. I had heard about his other books and how scary they were, but frankly I was more frightened with the airplane ride I was on while I was reading it! Good book but shouldn't be labeled as 'scary'."
2,"King strikes out with ""Tom Gordon"".","""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" was an okay novel. As an avid reader of Stephen King, I bought this book with great expectations. Being lost is one of my biggest fears and if anyone can put this into words, Stephen King can right?....WRONG! This book would have been so much better if it was written as a short story. King spent too much time with lame explantations and not enough time on things such as ""The God of The Lost."" The book was too reality based, although it picked up toward the end. My suggestion for any potential readers of this book is to skip the entire middle of the book; read the very beginning and the very end (Top of the First and Bottom of the Ninth). The middle of the book could best be described as ""The Girl Scout Camping Survival Guide."" A definite disappointment Mr. King."
2,Just a Quickie to Make Money,"AHHHHH!!!! As a Stephen King fan I was greatly disapointed with this ""book."" King definitely has a way with words as he has proven in all his other novels, but this one misses the mark of being a King book."
2,Barely enough plot for a short story,"This one was the second novel by King in a row that I consider ""boring"" (after Bag of Bones). I really can't believe, that this once wonderful author of shockers like ""It"", ""Pet Semetary"", ""The Shining"" or ""Salem's Lot"" has written down such a lame story. I must say, that I knew this story would be boring, but I bought it just for the baseball scenes in it - and these are pretty good. But could one honestly say that this novel has something like an interesting ""plot""? No! A girl, struggling for survival in the woods - or: wandering around -, that's not a story I would want to read a second time. That's barely enough for a short story."
3,Quick Read - One Tough 9 Year Old!,"Though this was unlike any Steven King I've read (Bag of Bones being my favorite), it was interesting. This young little girl shows the strength and stamina you seem to expect from a young child. Her undying love for the game of baseball and in particular, Boston Red Sox player Tom Gordon, is in itself the fuel she uses to keep going. The games her mind plays on her makes the long lost journey in the woods even more real. You want to take her in your arms and make it all go away and give her a good warm meal and a hug. He's right, I wouldn't want this to happen to my daughter or anyone else's for that matter. I think being alone in the woods and lost at night would probably be the scariest thing a child could imagine. Try reading it through a child's eyes. What a brave little girl!"
2,Unengaging,"This is a disappointment. Although the premise sounded quite good, the book isn't. It fails on the most basic point: You do not care very much about the little girl, she is utterly unengaging. She talks like an adult (and I don't refer to the four-letter-words she uses) - a beginner's fault for every writer: You don't just say that a character is nine years old - you also WRITE him/her as a nine year old. Furthermore, the incedents that happen to her aren't particulary interesting. The only joy in this short novel is King's writing style - which still shines in some places. Even though the book is quite short, I would exchange it with Mr. King's brickstones any day. Review by Oliver Naujoks, Marburg/Germany"
5,"Excellent! Couldn't put it down, didn't want it to end!","I've been a fan of Stephen King's for years. I enjoyed ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" tremendously. The Trisha McFarland character is spunky, resourceful and very brave. I now understand how very easy it is for a person, child or adult, to get lost in the woods. I think every child at some time or other thinks ""They'll be sorry when I'm not here anymore"" and for Trisha it actually happened. Stephen Kings description of the White Mountains made me feel as if I were right there with Trisha, he still has the ability to keep me glued to the book wishing it wouldn't end. Excellent story!"
2,The Writer Who Loved To Repeat Himself,"Stephen, it's time to move on.King pulls out all his patented gimmicks in this quick read. The ewwwww factor, the bogeyman, the troubled pre-adolescent, the faceoff at the end. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Stephen wrote of his methods in ""Danse Macabre"" and now it's time to move on.""The Girl..."" is not without some fun (in the King sense) but why try to shoehorn the gimmicks to fit the story.Someday (soon I hope), King will drop his compulsion to shock and gross-out and simply write a good story. Ya know ya got it in ya, Steve!"
1,Not his best...,"I was so excited that there was a new King book out after the horrible ""Storm of the Century"" , but after I read this one, I was asking myself if we were ever going to read anything as good as his older stuff again. I found it boring, the main character was okay, but I found it hard to believe that a nine yr. old girl would say some of the things that she did. All in all, when I was finished reading it, I thought what Trisha thought at the end, ""That's it? That's all there Is????"" Very disappointing.(Especially for $16.00)"
2,to long and no point,"Who wants to read 200 pages about a girl wandering around in the forest? And what was up with that wasp guy? How wierd did he get?No offence to Stephen King but I think that he is flat out crazy!He needs to write a novel that actually makes sence! Who cares what a descriptive writer he is, if you dont have a decent plot, than the story in ruined.I give Stephen King credit for at least attempting to write a decent novel.He is an exellent writer wiht great potential.All he needs to work on is a better plot and story."
2,unappealing,i took up this book because i expected something much more than the book actually has.I has very little to give the readers.Its just BORING.This was the the first Stephen king that i read and i was really dissapointed.But the desciption of the woods is very well written in the book.That is the only plus point.
1,Inexcusable,"This book is so horrid I don't even know how to convey it. Like Gerald's Game, this book doesn't have enough of a plot to keep you interested. It is basically just this little girl wandering about the woods, and trying to survive. King is an enigma because in latter years he is trying to write diffently than his successful ventures! He needs to stick with what he began with-horror, suspense, etc. This story should be labeled young adult. I think teens might enjoy it. Maybe."
2,This book kind of sucked,"I didnt really like this book, I didn't find it scary at all it made me unintrested and not want to read it. There was really no mistery to keep you on the eagde of your seat."
5,Another Great Character,"Stephen King is a master at creating great characters, and 9 year old Trisha is no exception as she tries to find her way back to civilization after becoming lost in the Maine woods. This book is a quick and easy read of a good story without any of the horror elements that are often present in King's stories."
1,"Stephen, you missed on this one","This book missed the mark by a ""green"" mile. It was not up to the author's usual standards. It wasn't boring, but it was predictable. It was obvious the big, bad monster was going to turn out to be a bear. I want the old Stephen King back, the one who writes 900+ pages and puts kids in peril. Now that is storytelling. Not this trash."
4,Can you write a whole book about one 9 year old girl being lost in the woods for 9 days? Stephen King can,"Can you write a whole book about one 9 year old girl being lost in the woods for 9 days? Stephen King can. Can you make a snap of a branch in the dead of the night make the hairs rise on your neck? Stephen King can. Can you wrap it all up in a metaphor of a baseball game and deliver a winning throw just when you thought all was lost? Stephen King can. Apart from slowing down in places where I couldn't understand the baseball references (didn't grow up with this game, in fact, I still don't get it), and apart from some things the girl utters that don't quite belong in a 9 year old's vocabulary, it was an excellent read with a masterful payoff at the end."
3,Eh,"I had a hard time deciding whether to vote this as a 2 or a 3. I ultimately chose a 3, because it is an average read when comparing it to most books; but it is not what you would probably expect from Stephen King. To me this seemed a short book, that had a way of drawing on and on. Still good writing though, and the story is interesting in it's own respect.A must read for those ""true"" Stephen King fans, because, well, what book he's written isn't? NOT one I would suggest for first time ventures into the masters works."
3,Lost and Confused,"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a brave attempt by Stephen King to scare us, and yet touch us, with his harrowing portrayal of a little 9 year old girl who gets lost in the woods. Although he succeeds to some point (Trisha McFarland is a very compelling character) the novel falls short. We really never feel that Trisha is in any sense of danger, and that takes a little away from the suspense of the novel, and what King is trying to do. However, he is, after all, trying to tell a story, a routine one at that, but with a little bit of a twist. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon isn't King's worst novel of which I have read (Misery) but it also isn't his best work and skill of writing. Disappointing, but I think we can forgive Mr. King."
3,Almost Realistic,"I consider this the worst book by King that I've read (please note that I haven't read many bad King books). It was way too short so there was no time to really develop a relationship with the character. I found myself not caring whether or not Trisha lives or dies.I gave it three stars because I think there is potential in the idea. The plot was interesting at first, but King has an inherent tendency to add little supernatural twists to his plots. This story would have been great if he had kept it completely real and possible. The survival techniques of little girls is a fascinating story by itself; King just threw the integrity of that concept away by adding the weird-creepy-following-monster into it."
4,"Simple, But Quite Entertaining","The Girl Who loved Tom Gordon is not Stephen King's best work. Its not complicated and involved as The Stand, or as bone chilling as The Shining. But It works. The woods are a scary place, and I used to be terrified of them as a kid. The idea of a little heroine with a possibly haunted walkman is a simple formula, not too big on horror, but big on courage and faith; which is another formula used in most of King's books. Trisha joins Dolores Claiborne or Jesse from Gerald's Game in Stephen's heroine against evil club. The baseball stuff was boring, since im not a sports fan, but it did have its purpose, and the ending could have been a little more scarier, because we were expecting a big climax. But it didnt, and it is an enjoyable book nevertheless. Not laying it on too thick, horror tactics this time around were replaced with old fashioned suspense and anxeity, and thats not so bad. A good quick read, worth giving a try."
4,Must be OK ...,Another thing picked up for my Daughter ... she hasn't complained about it so the disk must have been in working condition and the game entertaining enough.
2,batman begins,i cant rate this game because it would not play on the system and it was to late to return it
4,Depends on your like of Batman,"If you love Batman, you will enjoy this game. You already get the drift of the story line. There isn't much exploring to figure things out, however, the usage of the original cast and the solid storyline makes it a good buy. I'm a huge Batman fan, so all things Batman usually tickle my fancy. Enjoy!"
3,Best Batman video game too !,"The game comes straight from the movie obviously.You unlock more and more movie clips and other prizes with every stage you complete.As for the graphics go , awesome.Batman has great climbing capabilties.His hit combos aren't so great either thats for sure.But you do have special movies that mainly invlove jumping up in the air and falling upside down and drop kick the opponent.I give it three out of five stars."
4,Batman has finally been done justice.,Batman Begins is a great game usind stealth ninja like abilities. The batmobile levels are fun too. The graphics in this game really bring it to life with amazing facial expressions. The only reason I didn't give this great game 5 stars is because I think they hould have tried to make more gadgets and more ways to get around obstacles. Another great thing about the game is that once you beat it you get the Dark Knight batsuit the Worlds Greatest Detective batsuit and The Caped Crusader batsuit. You also can drive the prototypr batmobile in the two driving levels. I HIGHLY reccomend playing this game on the challenging mode if you don't you can quickly beat the game in around 6 or 7 hours. Overall I fell that the 40 dollar price on this game is perfectly fair. - Max
3,I was expecting more,I saw Batman Begins and I thought it was pretty good. I was very excited when I heard there was going to be a game based on the movie. When I rented it I was very disapointed. This game is so short that I got frustrated about it. The best thing in this game is using stealth and scaring your emimies. The game is very repeditive. Overall it's a rent.
4,East meets West in the wide blue yonder,"I confess I am a sucker for anything put out by the maestro Djivan Gasparyan. How does one explain the sound - the emotions - conveyed by the duduk in words? Impossible! It's like trying to describe the glory of spring blossoms to the blind. Okay, enough poetic license. What makes this album worthy of repeat plays (besides Gasparyan) is the extremely rare musical sensibility of Michael Brook. His past collaborations with musical greats like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (Night Song) and U Srinivas (Dream) have been outstanding. He does not disappoint us this time either, although the use of some hackneyed guitar riffs on a few tracks precludes a 5-star rating. In found the songs ""Freedom"", ""Dark Souls"" and ""Take My Heart"" in particular, positively haunting. Overall, a welcome addition to any discerning collection."
3,Interesting,"If you are dealing with duduk and/or similar instruments, you should buy this. On the other hand, I can say, I think it might be better when I think about the quality of Gasparyan and Brook."
3,So so...,I was hoping for more of Djivan; interesting mix of styles. It seems like the album was rushed and not fully finished. They're both very talented artists and I think could've done a much better job (maybe the next album!)
1,blaahhk!!!,"I'm a fan of Gasparyan's work, and an avid Realworld follower, but this collaboration with Brook is the worst album I have heard by these artists."
5,a western classic better than almost all others,"I love this one. Again, this was a recommendation from the old man. He has fond memories of this one from his youth. I can see why. Jimmy Stewart hans in a great performance that shows a range one wouldn't expect from him. The story itself is good, as the protagonists get what is coming to them in the end. In the process, Stewart becomes a little tougher than in other movies. Great twist! All in all, a very good flick."
3,"Sophia Loren in ""Between Strangers""","I found this to be a very experimental and unusualconcept for a drama. It's always a visual treat to see afine performance from Sophia Loren. Her dramatic rangehas expanded in her later years, lending pathos to a filmwhich features frankly depressing subject matter. Whilethe three protagonists escape their circumstantial andunfulfilled lives rooted in unhappy relationships with theirfathers or spouses, that escape doesn't occur until thevery very end of the drama, painting the experience in verygloomy colors. The concept of the three parallel lives is aninteresting one and I wondered throughout if the director,Edoardo Ponti might be the now adult son of Sophia Loren.I'm sure he's some relationship to Carlo Ponti. I enjoyedBetween Strangers, but it wasn't thrilling."
4,"Celebrate woman, don't burn the bra",My admiration of Sophia Loren borders on idolatry. Though she will not go down in history as one of our great actresses she was not bad in the movie.Eduardo Ponti made this movie with his mother in it and it is decisively a success. I loved the subtle play of relationships and experiences that are all too familiar to us. It is a lovely gentle movie in which the characters remains true to themselves and the story line is soft. I appreciate that the movie goer's intellect are not doubted by spelling/blaring/yelling out the plot or clues. We are trusted to pick them up ourselves and interpret them as we wish.This movie is a true celebration of woman without needing to burn the bra.
5,Highly recommend,Great product and great service. The incense smells great and lasts a long time. I will definitely be ordering again.
3,Opium Incense review,"I was hoping for the strong aromatic fragrance of burning opium incense. There was the faintest scent of the usual opium incense, however it was extremely weak and nearly unrecognizable. The overall scent was pleasant enough and the sticks did have a nice slow burn which is always a good sign. This incense is better than most of the cheap store bought stuff that is passed off for incense. I think the manufacturers of this particular incense attempted to cut to many corners or use substitute inferior products which weakened the scent, mixed in with the pleasant scent, was a pungent unpleasant mystery Oder that surfaced almost subliminally minimizing the olfactory pleasure. Overall this incense is not for the aficionado, but for every day home use in small quantities for some one that is not to picky about their background incense, it is acceptable."
2,Two Smart Girls Grow Up,I would have rated it three stars if it would have had all three girls from the Original but since it didn't two stars. The plot drags and while Deanna gives a good performance it was hard to see Helen Parrish as Kay Craig. Kay grew up all right she grew up into an entirely different person! Nan Grey's presence is nostalgic as was Charles Winninger reprising his role but it lacks what Three Smart Girls had-fun! The songs however are very good. An uneven sequel that proves that even during Hollywood's Golden Age sequels have never really worked.
4,cautionary note,"I have fine blond/brown hair. This gel works great on my hair for hold; but the ""psycho silver"" color doesn't show through on light colored hair, apparently. Also pricey for such a small amount."
1,Useless,The tubes were half empty and the consistency was odd for a gel...almost liquidy. Makes me think I got a bad batch or it's just a bad product. Was suppose to use it for a hair show....that got scrapped!!!
2,Book left out important fact....,"I only give this book 2 stars because it does not give the true account of Mohommad's life. He had sex with children - that is a fact. Read the Hadith, it plainly states that mohammed had sex with girls at least 7-8 years old. If he were alive today he would be arrested and put in jail. I would then call mohammed a pedophile pervert.Why dont we hear the truth about islam and not this watered down version?"
1,unsatisfied,"not what I wanted, was called and offered a replacement because they did not have the camera I ordered. This camera was supposed to be new but it was obviously refurbished. It broke the first time I used it and the display is not functioning properly."
1,Not a digital camera,Thought it was a digital camera. So I couldn't rate this camera. I sent it back about 3weeks ago and still haven't receive my refund. Hope the seller ( New 2 Sell) credits me soon.
5,Great camera if you can still find one!,"I received this camerera as a prize and would recommend it to anyone. We use this camera as our primary camera for everything! I took it in with me when my daughter was born, snorkeling, fishing, hiking and I have now handed it to my now toddler. If you have had a toddler, they can break anything with the exception of this ELPH SPORT. I have had this camera for 4 years and have nothing but good things to say!"
2,If you really want an underwater camera....,"...get the SeaLife ReefMaster. 16.4 feet could turn out to be a real limitation. Besides, for that kind of range, the Canon Sureshot A-1 is a better buy."
2,Great while it worked,"Great camera, compact and good looking. It made great pictures, the downside is that it stoped working after 6 months, it began having problems that were solved by calling Canon's 800 #, I now have to send it in to be checked or replaced.Again, it may be my bad luck, if I was rating the months it worked I would've given it 5 stars. Hope you have better luck!"
4,"Good camera, good value.","My camera has really stood up to the elements and multiple beatings. It has worked well for me taking pictures underwater and in the surf, and has also been to the top of multiple 20,000+ feet mountains. Dropped countless times on rock, snow, sand, and also dunked as much into water. I have learned to force the flash on anything but super sunny days - the pics come out a bit dark in conditions other cameras would have no problem with, and i've found it could really use a filter in intense light situations. Nothing you wouldn't expect from a specialty use camera. Just bought a second spare one for when the first one finally does give up - which i don't think will be for a long time.Good camera and good value!"
5,AWESOME ACTION-THRILLER !!!,"ROUTE 9 is an extremely well-crafted rural thriller with gripping performances by Kyle MacLachlan, Wade Williams, Peter Coyote, Miguel Sandoval and Roma Maffia. The story is somewhat comparable to A SIMPLE PLAN, but the twists and turns come faster and more furiously. When two small town deputies find a million and a half bucks in cash at the scene of a drug deal gone bad, they take the money and successfully cover their tracks--or so they think. The director, David Mackay, (who made a film called THE LESSER EVIL which is as good, if not better, than ROUTE 9) does an excellent job of maintaining suspense and tension. The situation becomes perilous, but there is an excellent sense of humor throughout the film. I can't recommend it highly enough!!!"
3,Late Night Movie...Lotsa Action...and KYLE!,This film was ALRIGHT...but not much more.If you have the DVD and haven't seen the movie...DON'T watch the Trailer First like I did! The Trailer gives TOO MUCH away.Okay movie to watch if you're needing distraction from vaccuming or laundry.
4,Suspenseful TV thriller.,"Two cops arrive at a crime scene with seven shot dead bodies and a suitcase with $1.5 million dollars. They decide to steal the money and don't mention it to anybody. But it turns out one of the shot people weren't dead and has heard everything and soon, they find themselves in deep trouble.The story is quite interesting. It shows how people can behave in ways they didn't know they were capable of, when they find themselves in strange situations. It's not too predictable and the movie has a nice, sometimes melancholic feeling. All the actors are good, especially Kyle MacLachlan, Wade Williams and Roma Maffia.I recommend you to see this movie, especially if you liked ""A Simple Plan"". It's a good, suspenseful thriller."
4,A Twisty Crime Drama,"Two small time country sheriffs stumble across a crime scene with a lot of dead bodies and a suitcase full of cash. Then they start making mistakes.Greed gets the better of them (and their friends) as the story keeps twisting tighter and tighter. Meanwhile, bodies keep pileing up and the hole they dig gets deeper and deeper.The only question that remains in this well made little film is who will make it out alive."
2,a highly average movie,"i didn't give it one star as kyle maclachlan's emoting scenes had me in stiches but the film was tedious. i guess it was supposed to be a moral about how ordinary people can go bad when money is involved but we didn't get to know anything about the 2 cop guys to begin with except kyle maclachan's character loaned his friend some money and trusted him to get it back (which since his pal had big gambling debts makes him more dufus than lovely guy). the filmmaker obviously thought his idea was so strong that he didn't have to put any work into developing it but really, this story is old. if you enjoy seeing kyle machlachlan you may get something out of this silliness."
4,A Basic Guide,"This book gives a good general overview of the types of dust collection systems avaialable to the home woodshop. It discusses how to calculate air flow, types of collectors and materails for vents, with good illustrations of the topics. This is a first step in determining the right type of dust collection system for your shop."
2,Some invalid data,"This book was my first readng on dust collection. My first impressions where very positive because the book was short and clear.However, after building my first dust collection system (and spending quite some $$$) following the instructions of the book carefully, I realize to my dismay that my system was not even as efficient as my shop vac. (I could have bought a shop vac for each of my tool for the price of my installation).After reading more litterature on the subject I realized that this book contains a lot of errors and describe system that are appropriate for hooking up 1 or 2 machine sitting next to the dust collector.The numbers describe to estimate the power of your dust collector, the size of your pipes, the CFM requirement of your tools are very underestimated.Some illustration are also showing stuff not to do like having long run of flexible pipe."
2,Not Enough,"There's just not enough in this guide to competently set up a system. That said, it will help someone with no idea about dust collection get an overview. What I missed most was how to size the system. If I used what kind of equipment, how much and how simultaneously, then how big a dust collection system do I need? This book just didn't give me enough."
2,Don't Squat,"These pants are very long, also they don't pass the squat test. If you don't know what I mean...they are thin and things show when you squat."
4,Just fine,"These are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine, are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking. It's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate."
4,cotton spandex boot pant,"I was looking for some exercise pants to fit my legs. I usually need at least a 32"" inseam and these fit the bill. My only concern is the fabric is a little thin and they might not last very long."
4,The electronic dimmer is different and takes a little time to get used to.,I have used the pole dimmers in the past that have the manual slide. Initially I didn't like this one as each time you hit the on sie it turns on to the last 'dim' setting. You press the the upper portion of the switch 2x and it goes full bright (actually you can double tap the top or bottom for full bright).If the kids are sleeping you don't have to slide the dimmer up and down to guess what the brightness will be when you flip it on. One touch to the top and it just comes on the previous dim setting which is very nice.
1,subscription problem,"I have been patiently waiting for my first issue but have not received one as yet! Therefore, I cannot comment on this magazine ""bon appetit""."
4,she doesn't like it,"NEW REVIEW! I take back what I said before about my sister liking this magazine. I mean, she likes it OK, but she says the articles are strange and only marginally cooking-related. She doesn't like how there are more ads than actual magazine content, and she was confused about the products being highlighted, as they are things even kitchen-gadget collectors (like my sister) kind of scratch their heads at.Wish I could change the star rating to 2 stars."
5,Made my Thanksgiving!,"I was given the Thanksgiving issue as a gift and used many of the recipes to make my dinner. In fact, the only non-Bon Appetit menu item was the mashed potatoes. Everything was huge hit. I am going to subscribe now so I can use their recipes more often!"
3,3rd at best,"Spent quite a few issues comparing Bon Apetit to Gourmet and Food & Wine and I felt that Bon Apetit was by far the third horse in this field. The writing is mediocre and the pictures show food the way you've seen it a million times. Very little special, what tried to be editorially special read more pretentious to me. I know it's been around for a long time but I didn't find much to give me any interest to buy it again."
1,Unauthorized charge on my credit card to renew unwanted subscription,"I bought a 1-year subscription through their website to try it out. After a year, I did not have any intention of renewing, but they kept sending me magazines. So I just waited for it to run out. After the 2nd year, I found a charge of $18 on my credit card. I called and asked them to refund it promptly. They told me they had me on a continuous subscription. Poor business practice, as I did not receive any notification of my credit card being charged, nor did I elect for this option."
3,Magazine interesting but caters to mainstream,This magazine has vivid pictures and great recipes as well as a question answer section where the subscriber can send in cooking questions in a Dear Abby type format. As I mentioned in my title this magazine caters to the mainstream of the cooking world (repetive information quite a lot)and sometimes can be over the head of a common homemaker. I would suggest ordering Gourmet or Cooking Light magazine rather than this one. If however you are looking to buy or for info on top brands and top resturants in major cities this is your magazine.
3,Bon appetit,A fancy food magazine. Interesting articles but odd recipes. It would be nice for those looking to really expand their cooking tastes but I found it not so useful for my kitchen.
5,Great Cooking Magazine,This is great for folks who like to try out new recipes... also a good gift for someone who likes to cook. I have a friend who asks for a renewal every year for her birthday 'cause she loves it so much.
3,Not so inspiring,"I have been reading Bon Appetit off and on for the past five years or so, and I have been comparing them to Gourmet (subscribe) and Food & Wine. I have seen the quality of the content diminish over the past years. The Recipes Request section has frankly begun to offend me- swooping too low.However, I keep some of the old issues around- especially, some of the holiday recipes for the day when I actually will have to cook a turkey and I can't reach my parents. But my parent's stuffing recipes are better, anyhow.If you want something for everyday, no-hassle cooking, this is probably the best choice. Pretty straightforward. Unlike Gourmet, this mag lacks helpful ""the how-to"" to supplement their recipes. For example, in the back of Gourmet, if they have a merigue recipe, they include a Julia Child step by step instruction.I would also agree with a previous reviewer, who noted that sometimes it is hard to distinguish the articles from the ads. That speaks loudly."
3,Bon Appetit has definitely changed...,"I have been subscribing to Bon Appetit for close to 10 years and I decided to write this review because I feel the magazine has really changed...for the worse...over the last 2 years. I used to love BA because the recipes were fantastic, ideal for entertaining, mostly easy and/or fast, with a few exceptions, and not too ""fancy"" with hard to find ingredients and things that a lot of people, just don't cook. It seems like the magazine has become much more ""high end"", more like Gourmet , which I don't like. I love to cook but I don't like to spend hours and hours searching for ingredients and standing over the stove everytime I decide to do so."
3,3rd best at best,"Spent quite a few issues comparing Bon Apetit to Gourmet and Food & Wine and I felt that Bon Apetit was by far the third horse in this field. The writing is mediocre and the pictures show food the way you've seen it a million times. Very little special, what tried to be editorially special read more pretentious to me. I know it's been around for a long time but I didn't find much to give me any interest to buy it again."
1,Magazine Renewal,This item has been paid for but I have not received an issue of the magazine yet and my subscription has expired. I will revise this review if I get the magazine soon.
1,Bad Customer Service From Publisher,I have never subscribed to Bon Appetit. But I subscribed to Gourmet Magazine through Amazon. Gourmet disappeared about October 2009. And I got assurances from Amazon and the magazine publisher that I would get Bon Appetit (another magazine from the same publisher) for the remainder of my Gourmet Magazine subscription (seem to recall it was over 6 months). Well here it is - almost March - and I haven't received a single issue of Bon Appetit. I can understand consolidation in the magazine industry - but not such lousy customer service.
4,Bon Appetit Magazine,This was a very good price for a very good magazine. I saved $3 - $5 overthe normal subscription rate!
4,Great Recipes,A friend of mine used to subscribe to Bon Appetit and flipping through the magazine I found so many interesting recipes.
5,Bon appetit is a great magazine for anybody who loves food!,I first got this as a free sample because of something else I had purchased through Amazon. My whole family loved it so much that we have been ordering it ever since. We both work in restaurants and consider ourselves to be foodies so it is perfect for us. We all(including my 5 year old daughter) get excited to look through it each month and find great new recipes that we have to try. There is a good mix of colorful pictures mixed in with the mouth watering recipes. I would say that this would be a good magazine even for someone who is not overly into food but who is looking for some good new dishes to add to their monthly repertoire or just a little inspiration.
4,Make a lady happy with a subscription,"Amazon sometimes makes it hard to say ""no"" to spending money. I really wasn't interested in a magazine subscription, but I knew someone who I suspected would love a subscription to a cooking magazine. And by golly I was right. My sister-in-law is head over heels after only the first issue of bon appetit magazine. And yes I had ulterior motives. She is a fine cook and I knew I would get a meal or two out of the deal."
4,From a Gift Giver's Perspective,"I recently ordered 3 subscriptions for 3 different individuals. 2 were new subscriptions while the other was an extension. I personally do not read Bon Appetit cover to cover but the 3 people who do love the magazine. Of course the recipients all enjoy cooking. From what I know, Bon Appetit focuses mostly on recipes while their secondary topics are restaurants and chefs from around the world. My girlfriend constantly shows me recipes from Bon Appetit that she wants to try..."
3,"Lot of style, not too much substance","Bon Appetit is a beautiful magazine to look at, but that is almost all I really use it for. I have had a subscription for the past year to this magazine and have found only one issue that was really useful. Bon Appetit has some good recipe ideas, but I never seem to have consistent results when trying them. They do have a great feature that lets you write in requesting the recipe for a dish at your favorite restaurant.The magazine is chock full of recipes, but the organization seems haphazard and finding the recipe you want is quite difficult. It is much better suited to casual browsing or scanning. As is common to many glossy cooking magazines, it is occasionally difficult to tell the difference between editorial content/recipes and ad content/recipes.... If you just want something that will look pretty on the coffee table or has pictures you can drool over and perhaps one great issue a year, ""Bon Appetit"" is the magazine for you."
2,"Eh, the pictures are pretty...","I got this magazine hoping for some new, innovative recipes, but instead, end up flipping through the magazine without saving any recipes at all. None of the recipes look that great, and they call for ingredients that you just can't find anywhere, even in specialty stores. I love the beautiful pictures, but as far as recipes, they just aren't for everyday cooks, adventurous or not."
4,Consistently Good,"I have received Bon Appetit for years and it has always been good. Whenever I need something new for a dinner party I'm sure to find it here. There are also lots of recipes that one can do during the week that just take up a little more time but make dinner that much more special. The concentration of the magazine is on food, not travel or wine as is the case for some others. I often use the website epicurious.com in conjunction with it and that is very helpful. I enjoy the articles and the pictures are done well. It is not a glitzy magazine but is consistently good."
4,A little too fancy for me,"I breeze through it to look for any plain boring stuff they might have (not very often). My wife likes to look at the desserts. This was purchased for us as a gift and we renewed once, so it peaked our interest enough to do that. Its a good magazine for the break room or the bathroom."
2,No Way,This magazine has so little real information on cooking that it is not worth reading. What information it does have is often for great hamburgers or how to prevent burning your French fries. Forget it.
5,Love it,"One of the best magazines out there, recipes are tested, information is accurate, beautiful to look at, great price excellent value"
1,Long time subscriber ends subscription,"I have been a subscriber for many years. More than I care to count! This year, however, will be my last.The magazine has been overhauled. It used to be full of fabulous recipes, travel stories about food, wine information ... everything you needed to really get to know and create food. Now, it is no better than a 30 minute Rachel Ray show. In other words, you'll get something to eat but it won't be special and you won't learn anything if you are already an accomplished cook.The design used to be clean and simple. Now, it is cluttered and might as well have a feed running across the bottom.Instead of it being a magazine for people who love to truly embrace the culinary arts, it has become just another magazine about food. Very sad.If you are just starting to cook, you might enjoy this magazine. If you can put together a meal without a box or can ... it is really not for you anymore."
3,Too many ads,"I have subscribed to several cooking magazines over the past few years, and have to say that I have been disappointed with Bon Appetit. The magazine is high in advertisements. From my Oct. 2008 mag, about 50 of 150 pages were full page ads. There were approximately 20 pages of recipes. However, I have yet to try any of these. Therefore my review isn't based on the quality of the recipes.There are usually several articles related to food travel, which I am not interested in. The food photography is good, but I find some of the recipes to be too extravagant/trendy for my lifestyle..nice to look at, but frankly I will never use these recipes.I have most enjoyed Cooks Illustrated and Cook's Country. These are ad-free and rich with recipes that I actually have tried and used over and over again. Bon Appetit is more of a lifestyle mag that doesn't seem to fit my lifestyle. I won't be renewing my subscription."
3,Not bad...,"... but not so good I would subscribe to this.This magazine is much like Gourmet. Same ads, though not as many, same layout. It's almost like another version of Gourmet.However, I enjoyed the articles more as well as the recipes than Gourmet. There were a few that I am intrigued enough to try. The recipes themselves were more fancy than say, Everyday Food.Then again, I like Everyday Food more because that's the type of food I eat.If you're looking for something a little more elegant without so many ads this isn't a bad one. I do think that Fine Cooking might be more your cup of tea. With fewer ads and more recipes."
1,Useless Waste of Paper,"This ""cooking"" magazine is more like a billboard that comes to your mailbox every month. More ads than articles, which is sad saying that the articles are essentially ads. There are very few recipes, and you will be lucky to get 1 recipe you actually want to try a month. They do not talk about cooking method, ingredient selection, or really anything related to actual cooking.This is ""Food Style"" this is not a cooking magazine."
3,Good magazine but not a good gift,"Bon Appetit is a good Foody magazine for both meat eaters and veggies alike. But if you want to give it as a gift, be sure and order your subscription about 2 months in advance. You seriously don't get the first issue until about 2 months later (which I don't really understand.)"
1,Pretentious and useless,"A friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because I like Cooks Illustrated. This magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants. There are so few recipies in it I wouldn't call it a 'cooking' magazine. What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.If you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine, then this magazine might be for you. If, however, you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it, try Cooks Illustrated instead."
2,Can get cheaper elsewhere...,"Nice scoop - thought it had a push-out thingie to eject the ice cream, but it's a simple scoop. Still nice. However, this exact scoop can be bought at TJ Maxx or Home Goods for $3.99. I saw it there recently. Nice scoop, but $10 is basically ""regular price"" for it."
5,Wow them at the next holiday party!,"This book matches the levels of Hal Leonard's Adult Piano Method Book 1, but can be used along with any piano method. The songs are progressively more difficult throughout the book, but don't go beyond the 'low D to high D' note range. It comes with a CD or MIDI disk, offering a full accompaniment if you don't have someone to play with you. But all the pieces can be played as solos. Standards like 'Ukranian Bell Carol,' 'Silent Night,' and 'Deck the Hall' will get you in the Christmas spirit!"
2,ajsabcjabkjabkc,"Mob Stereo is a punk band from NYC. They are like one of those bands you would see at the Continental or CBGB's every weekend. They started in 2002 and now this is their first full-length album. The songs are short and simple. There is a sketch of them on the cover of this. At least the Ramones let us have a photo. Every song like ""Future"" only has three or four chords. All the songs are verse-chorus-verse. There are no guitar solos. The vocals by Noor Jahan. Her voice is very quiet for a punk band. There are many of these types of bands in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and when I see them, I usually hate them. Mob Stereo doesn't really have any catchy tunes. They seem being comfortable being this tame band. I wish there was more energy on this record. When you get the song ""Revolution"" you wish for something faster with more excitement, not a ballad. I have heard worse. The Germs weren't too good at first."
4,Among the best of Sabatini's early works.,"Although certainly not on a par with the author's more famous works, Captain Blood, Scaramouche or The Sea Hawk, Mistress Wilding (first published in 1910 under the title Arms and the Maid or Anthony Wilding) can be ranked among the best of Sabatini's early novels. In it are all the seeds of his later genius: a tight and twisting plot, historical accuracy, sparkling dialogue and plenty of lively humor. As with Cpt. Blood, the story takes place during the ill-fated Protestant rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth against James II. The characters are carefully drawn, though the protagonists are not quite as appealing as in other novels. What makes the story unique is that we really do not know who will be the hero and who the villain until the latter third of the book. Perhaps that is why Sabatini changed the title for the American edition. Not the best the author has to offer, but Sabatini fans will love it, as will lovers of historical romance."
4,Vintage Sabatini,I am a dedicated fan of Mr. Sabatini's works and am in the process of completing Mistress Wilding. I cannot say enough good things about it. I love the prose. Wish modern authors could convey their ideas in such a way.
1,Bad batteries,Though it apears to be a good deal only about half of them actually work. I think they were just old batteries.
1,Size labeling confusing. Am now stuck with a bunch of unusable batteries.,"Have ordered from this company before and all was well. This time, I ordered multiple packages for a discount. Then, when I pulled out the first package and realized the batteries didn't fit, it was past the return policy deadline. Am contacting the seller directly to see if the situation can be rectified; but, I don't have much hope."
1,hate it,"The first four batteries went dead as soon I put it on the device. Tried a different pack and worked for two days, I will not buy from this vendor again."
5,A good deal,"These are the same size 13 batteries I used to purchase at the store but a lot cheaper. They last just as long as the more expensive ones. With 2 hearing aids, I use a lot of these so this is a good buy. This was my second order."
1,Hearing Aid batteries from Local Battery.com,It seems there is something wrong with the batteries. They do not even last for 1 hour and they should last for at least 5 days. Is there a number I can call to talk with Local Battery?
3,icell Tech size 13 batteries,"fast shipping, first set of batteries have lasted 6 days so far, but hearing aids are not as loud as they were with other batteries, plus i've notice my daughter(3yr old) is not as attentive as she was while using the other batteries."
5,Good value,Last nearly as long as the name brand for much less money. Will buy again when these run out.
5,Surprised at how long these last. GREAT VALUE,"Cheap, and they last a good long time in my behind the ear hearing aids. Product shipped fast. I am using less batteries.I highly recommend these batteries and the seller I got them from Good value"
4,not bad for five bucks,"Amazon tempted me with a five-dollar annual subscription, and I bit. It's been worth it. I enjoy the pictures (refreshing to see great beach pix in the dead of winter) and try not to get bogged down in the articles. Lots of web site references, if you want more details about a destination or property. A few good recipes here and there, both for drinks and food."
3,"Excellent pictures, good travel magazine","While CT+L (luckily) doesn't insist on having some type of rating in every issue that Conde Nast is obsessed with (Gold List/Best of/yada yada yada), I would like to see more critical writing and fewer pages of advertising at the end of the magazine. However, I already get Florida T+L so I knew what to expect: lots of pretty pictures and an occasional article out of the ordinary."
1,Confusing book on basic biology topics,"My son is using this book in his freshmen 'intro to biology' course. This book is so incredibly difficult it rivals some of my advanced biology classes taken in college. The wording is complex and written at such a high level that even I have to re-read many sentences. Too many big words and complex ideas packed into a small space. The graphics are not very helpful. I would never consider buying this book if I was a science teacher. My son now hates science because of the complexity of the topics presented. Fine for a college level class, but for a freshmen bio?? Not a chance."
1,Ridiculous in every way,"This is by far one of the worst textbooks I have ever seen in my life. The writers put no effort into making it clear for the reader to understand, and the multiple choice questions that my Biology teacher makes us do at the end of each chapter don't even nail key points, many of them are random. Not to mention I can't carry it in my backpack as my it's heavier than any book I've ever held.If you're an educator and are considering to buy this book for your students, don't. It'll only make the students more stressed and frustrated."
5,GREAT WATCH,This is my husband's third pathfinder watch in 16 years. He LOVES this one the best. It is so much easier to use. He has a big wrist and the dial is perfect. It arrived in record time in perfect condition. Thank you.
1,"Great product, poor service","The watch is great, but if you ever need service, FORGET IT! You would be better off buying a new watch. Casio service apparently has not grasped the meaning of ""customer service""; tried to charge me ANOTHER $45 after servicing my watch and having the buttons fall off"
4,Best Sport Watch on Market,"Thus far I have owned two Casio PAG40 Pathfinder Triple Sensor Multi-Function Sport Watches which is proof that I like the product. This watch has been worn when scuba diving to over 130' deep and under very challenging conditions including heavy vibration and has never failed. The compass is great as it helps to verify your position when necessary. I have never trusted the temperature gauge but like the altitude function. I use the stopwatch function to keep track of my golf score (one second equals each stroke) and number of fish caught more than as a ""stopwatch"". Light always works and is quite bright. Watch has three batteries so it is somewhat expensive when you need to replace a battery but...that's the cost for a very busy watch. Consider getting a spare gasket/seal so when you replace the batteries you have a quality new seal too. Great watch and probably the best sport watch on the market."
3,Not As Good As You Think,"If you're depending on this product in a a SHTF scenario, you've chosen poorly. If there is a situation where you're going to be fending for yourself over a long period of time, why are you getting a watch that runs on batteries? You'll be EXTREMELY lucky to find replacements. Is looking for watch batteries going to be high on your survival list? Hopefully not. Get a good mechanical watch that winds itself. And learn to use a compass."
1,Semi accurate with a defective compass,I took this digital watch with me to Bhutan and found it semi-accurate with altitude readings (within 50' of actual altitude) but the compass was completely worthless. The compass reads off bearing by 15 to 20 degrees. No small error. I followed scores of time to to reset it but nada. Each time I check it against other navigational compasses it was always off bearing. Thank God that I had a magnetic compass too. Always bring a back up! Not recommended.
3,Bulky but good,This watch is big. I guess It has to be with all the features. The altimeter and the barometer are accurate if you synchronize them. The temperature is always higher then it is because it's on your wrist. Overall it's pretty good.
4,Reivew A Question of Magic,"A Question of Magic by Tom Mcgowen, is an enchanting story about a young man named Lithim, who travles with his father,Mulng andother races of creatures such as trolls, dragons, little people etc. the group of travelers find a goddess named Gurda who tells them how to prevent the destucrtion of the world the do as told and are saved."
4,Very good but with one problem though...,I have one problem with this set. It does not include the special 14th episode. Although this was not aired in america would it of hurt to have put it on the DVD? I have dial-up so if I want to see that episode I`ll have to spend hours downloading it. Damn.
5,Tenchi Muyo OVA DVD Set,"I completely love this DVD! If you are a Tenchi fan it is a must-have! The animation is wonderful, the story lines are so interesting and exciting and the characters are the best! I love Ryoko she is the best in this series! If you are into anime and action packed romance/comedies then you will love this series! When I bought this I was fairly new to Anime and was just fascinated by it. It was unlike anything I have ever watched. The best thing about this series is....everything!Also if you have only seen the edited Toonami version you HAVE to see this version they cut so much out of it that has no reason being cut. I mean I can understand editing the nudity because kids watch Toonami but they cut scenes that have nothing wrong with them! Anyway get this DVD even if you have never seen anime ( this was one of the first anime series I ever saw and is what got me hooked on Anime.) I just know you will fall in love with it like I have!"
5,Tenchi Muyo! A classic,"What is there to say? after almost 10 years since the original release of this set, This Tenchi Muyo Box-Set continues to excite and dazzle customers, whether you first saw it when it came out, you were glued to it on Toonami, or are just getting into it for the first time, Tenchi Muyo doesn't let you down, the box-set itself is great aswell, with a nice clear sleeve over top a great picture of Ryoko, the discs contain all 13 episodes of the first 2 OVA's, in great quality, both the dub and sub are phenomenal, with a third disc containing trailers and fun extras, something any Otaku or Tenchi fan would foam overAll in all, Get this box-set, it may be a little pricey for some, but with the amount of content presented, its worth every penny for this Anime classic"
5,Great,I was mostly excited about spending the eighty three dollars. I mean WOW! Where else can you just give away that kinda cash!
3,Its like they tried to give it a deeper meaning.,"This has a decent story good action and remarkable character developement but is all obsolete when you don,t have enough focus on an actual plot. There are about 10 episodes and the rest are fillers. Yeah if you have plenty of free time go ahead and buy it if you can afford it."
2,Childish but not really for children,"I was a bit disappointed with this series. I'm a huge fan of Japanese animation but I found the story telling, with all the goofy love triangles, trite. The idea that all the women in the house (even the mother of one of his admirers.) are in love with this young man is male ego in its purest form. The whole thing is too silly for adults to enjoy and there are too many sexual references for small children. The animation was good but certainly not ground breaking. Given the exorbitant price I would recommend missing this one."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!,Tenchi is my favorite anime searies of all time and when i heard about it I Just had to buy it. If you liked any of the Tenchi Muyo! saga you will love this box set. And it is well worth the money.
4,Tenchi Muyo! is the best!,"I began wathing Tenchi Muyo! on Cartoon Network when it aired. At first I that it was stipid and strange. I started watching more of it. I found it to be funney, cute, and full of action. Then I realized that it was all censered! I thought that if it is this funny censored, it has tto be great. This is not recomened for little children who watches the show. If you are a parent of young children that watches this show, buy the edited version on VHS at Walmart. The uncensored version has sexual inuindos, such as in scenes where Little Washu tries to get a sprem sample from Tenchi, Ryoko being happy of being a saddist, a baby breast feeding and playing with Mihoshi's breast, ect ect ect. For begining fans, save your money up and get this Tenchi Muyo! series first. Buy this 1st, then Tenchi Universe, then Tenchi in Tokyo, then Tenchi the movie: Tenchi Muyo! in Love, then Tenchi Forever, and finally Tenchi the movie 2: Daughter of Evil last"
4,"Great start, slow finish","This is a fun, laugh filled anime piece with a healthy bit of fantasy and SciFi. The first half of the series was very good, with a solid, ongoing story and lots of humor. After the first full story, however, things start to break down. The story starts to lose focus, meandering with various starts that lead nowhere. While still fun, it becomes very episodic, and starts at least three ongoing stories which are not continued. Maybe they get back to them in the movies.I enjoyed the set, but the first DVD is the best with the second being okay and the third nearly useless. The third disk is a collection of information and trailers on the series and movies, but is mostly untranslated. What is translated has to be read off the screen in large blocks of text, not subtitling. It contains no additional episodes."
4,An amazing DVD Box Collection,"Well I must say that this DVD set is more then worthy in my book. The animation is extremely well done and the number of episodes placed in each DVD disc is very good.The 3rd DVD, The Tenchi Encyclopedia, was a worthy little extra as the 2 other discs are pretty much extra-less but I suppose that the amount of stuff in the TE, makes up for it in spades.I'd have given it 5 stars, if it wasn't for the fact that the 13th(and final) episode's subtitling's timing seems a tad off; but a great job all around...More people should who love anime should consider this a keeper."
5,YEAH! TENCHI IS ON DVD!,"I LOVED this DVD box set. I've seen the original Tenchi Muyo Collection on VHS and I have to admit...bringing it to DVD was a GREAT IDEA! Also, the Tenchi Encyclopedia is another great addition! Tenchi is a great anime. It has all the classic elements...girls, space, and humor!"
5,tenchi muyo,My kids and i enjoyed watching this box set. I recieved the box set quickly and from the time i ordered it.
3,"It's Good, But. . .","I like the program, but I really wish that it was available for the Mac. As it is, I had to buy Virtual PC just to run it. I really wish that software companies would be more inclusive, instead of moving some of us to the back of the bus."
1,Rather disappointing,"While the program has a lot of features, it is in no way possible to create any sort of drawing that could be submitted to a zoning commision or regulating body. The 3-D view is difficult to control, and the perspective inside a structure is abysmal; it is only good for external views. Drawing a terraced home with rooms at different levels was not possible without having part of the home flying out in space or under ground. The landscape grading feature could not correct this problem.In all very disappointing."
1,My house turned out terrible!,"OK, so I bought the program and designed my house. Then I printed the house plan and proceded to build my house. When I finished construction of the new house I stood back and admired my work. Right away I could tell something wasn't right. The house is really tiny! In fact it measures 11"" long x 8 1/2"" wide. Great - the house is worthless! I have a wife and 3 kids and it don't take a rocket scientist to see that we all ain't gonna fit in this teeny weeny house. My friend Earl says I shoulda printed the plans on a bigger printer. Now he tells me. That's a great idea but I can't seem to find a printer that uses 40-foot x 60-foot paper. I don't think I would recommend this program. It didn't say anything about this on the box."
