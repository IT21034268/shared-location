4,"Great list of courses, quality printing",I gave this as a gift to a well heeled friend who lives out of state. Though he has already played several of the courses he was very excited about the list and he said that the pictures and overall quality of the book were excellent.
1,Totally damaged,"I just received the book from Amazon LLC and I was very very disappointed with its condition. I wonder if it came to South America in the back of a burro across the Rain Forest. Its cover was folded, the book was scratched, one of its corners was bended in and the overall shape was indescribably poor. What happened to Amazon??? They say it's new when you buy it, but when it arrives looks like a second (or third) hand. Shame. I will think twice before buying at Amazon again. It was supposed to be a gift, but now I am ashamed to give it."
5,"Another son-in-law, another great book",Tom is an avid golfer. Now he hopes to travel to golf at some of the courses in this book. He was very happy to have received it!
3,Not as many pictures as I thought,I thought this book would have pictures of each course they recommended but they only had pictures for about half of the places. I was disappointed and think this book is worth less than the price they charged due to the shortage of color photos.
3,Shipped Wrong.,Folding larger stickers like this and stuffing them into a box does not help in the application process.Stickers of this nature are hard to apply if you don't know what you are doing.The included directions are incorrect so this is why you get 2 of ea.Spray a mix of water and dish soap on the window and the sticker glue side.Apply sticker from bottom up and pass a credit card up the center to set it in place.Squeeze out all the water and when it drys it will be set.I was sent a different set of stickers but all I wanted are the 2 smaller ones anyway.The others I will put on eBay.
3,Polished production diminishes effect,"This release by geri Allen is very polished, so much so that it reduces some of it's impact and thus reflects the 3 star rating as opposed to four. The music ranges from straight ahead jazz to mild free explorations. All in all a dark tone is felt throughout the entire disc culmintaing in the last piece ""Angels"" which is probably the best composition here. Allen has talent both as a player and a composer and despite the overpolished production that is what makes this release worthwhile."
3,"Colorful and imaginative, but a bit long winded",This series is definitely worth reading and this book finally brings the plots together. Her writing seems to be improving.I could wish that the editors had done a bit of cutting. Parts of the story seem to repeat and to be a bit uninspired at times. I also think she reveals too much about characters' motivations and the history of the world around them. A little bit more should have been left to the imagination.
4,Enjoyable reading for those of us who really like fiction.,"Robin Hobb is one of my favorite authors for light reading. This trilogy held my interest until the very end but it started to get long at the end. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book, the story just didn't wrap up as I would have liked."
5,great trilogy,"Love robin Hobb and this series is my favorite so far, I read it twice ( all 6 books) waiting for the last book coming in April!"
4,great late night reading,"I am so thankful for a great series that comes to a satisfactory conclusion in 3 books. I loved her Assasin trilogy but enjoyed this one even more. The characterization was great. I cared about how each of the main characters fared. Although the ending was Hollywood-like(just how you would want it to be) and there were some bits that were not filled out (Amber sought for Wintrow just to tell him that?) the writing was exceptional. As an avid consumer of escapist fantasy, I felt this was one of the best series I have read (comparable with early Goodkind, Jordan, Martin). There were some obvious machinations of plot to arrive at the desired end, but I raced through the last 100 pages to find out what would happen to each well developed character"
5,I've packed my bags; I'm heading for Bingtown!,"As always Hobb has managed to craft her characters excellently and imbued them with qualities so human that even when you hate them you can't resist admiring some part of them. You get to know the characters so well that even though their deeds may be treacherous, your understanding of their motivations and their own inner struggles forces you to feel compassion for them (to a greater or lesser extent). Skillfully crafted! I didn't want this series to end. I loved it even more than the Assassin series. Please Robin, if you are out there, tell us what happens next."
5,One of the best fantasies I've read in a long time,"I thought this trilogy started out a little slow, and stretched on a bit long during the first book. But, because I loved what the author had done with the farseer trilogy so much, I stayed with the series anyways. I'm glad I did. Kennit was one of the most completely realized villains I've ever read. I actually felt sorry for him, and it was refreshing to end a series on a note of regeneration and healing. My only complaint is that now I'll have to wait another year or two for Mrs. Hobb to publish her next book. I'm glad she's returning to Fitzchivalry - I thought the final one left too many strings hanging, especially for a chararacter I had come to care so much about."
3,I like the dragon!!,"Well after just finishing the book I want more, although to be honest it did become quite hard going at times, especially in the middle of the book. The characters are amazing, very indepth, and this could be some of the problem. You spend so much time with a character the book begins to slow down slightly and you lose the theme a bit. Some of the revelations in the book are very cool and make pieces from the earlier books make sense. But I liked the dragon the best anyway, such arrogance, and also weakness. The descriptions of her are also amazing. i will be reading any other books she writes although i feel that the assassin trilogy was better. It was very daring to write a whole trilogy that was solely dependant on ships and the pirates do keep it exciting, although i think i will keep my imagination firmly on dry ground in future!!"
5,no complaints here,In simple words ... reading robin hobb is pure entertainment. I was drawn in immediately to the farseer trilogy and because of that I picked up her liveship series. Want to get lost in a book...read Robin Hobb.
1,Paperback?,"I do not want paperback books cluttering my bookshelves. If you know of somebody that does, by all means have at it."
5,Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass Deodarant from Amazon - awesome,"I love this item..........I've used it for years......and I reallllly appreciate the price that I'm able to get from Amazon -- it's much, much better than in the stores. Thank you."
2,where's the erotica????????,"i'm an avid reader of black lace books. well an avid erotica reader actually. from a black lace book point of view this book was very disappointing. this was more of a SEMI-erotic fantasy story. i truly missed the graphic, sexual sizzle black lace books are known for :o("
2,Incomplete Songs!!!,"I've been looking for quite a while for a CD full of classic hymns around amazon. I thought I finally found the set to get in this. Who could resist CD's with Amazing Grace, Blessed Assurance, Rock of Ages, Old Rugged Cross, etc. Too my great disappointment, I don't think any of the hymns come with all the verses. The soprano often takes solos and takes away from the full chordal sound I expect from hymns. They only sing the 1st, 2nd and last verses in Amazing Grace, one of my favorite songs. How can they cut out half the verses of the most popular hymns of all time? If you are looking for a collection of hymns, keep searching, because as far as I'm concerned this contains NONE of my favorites if they only sing 1 to 3 verses per song."
3,Great Selection Spoilt by Inappropriate Singer!,"I was really impressed by the track list on this CD set and loaded all three into my CD player and settled back to enjoy the music. Sadly, many of the tracks I found almost unlistenable, as they were performed by a solo female singer with a terribly harsh and strident voice who seemed to be straining her vocal chords for volume rather than allowing the sweetness of the music to come through. Those tracks with group harmonies were brilliant, but my enjoyment was somewhat spoiled by the solo female singer."
3,CD is just ok,CDs laike this one are a collection of songs that have been sung by many artist. Seems very commercial to me like a lot of karaoke CDs. Sometimes the music drowns out the vocalist.
1,Who's the music director?,I love hymns. I work out to hymns. But this collection is sooooooooooo slow!!! They've slowed down every good hymn to the point it is painful to listen to it. I do not recommend this DVD unless you like your music painfully slow.
1,"So, so, so slooooow",I agree with another reviewer; the songs are so slow they are unbearable. I'm selling my set at a garage sale and looking for something with a little more pace!
2,Screechy solos.,"Some of this CD is ok, but they have a solo soprano on some of them that sounds very screechy. Also, they ruined ""Redeemed"" by changing the tune. Do not recommend."
4,Kanu figure by Griffin,"I like it, but i didnt feel like it looked much like Kanu Unchou, but i do like the figure itself is nice art work if i do say so myself. great size too. not for kids. No Nudity, removable Naganata weapon. love the pose now that i saw her do this actual pose in the series."
4,An Easy Winner,"I like this album for the reasons that the Florida listener didn't. The freshness Roberts brings to these Rags has reawakened my interest in Joplin. Its also nice to here some new music inspired by Joplin. I even broke out the sheet music and revisited Maple Leaf myself with a new attitude. Joplin is in capable hands with Roberts. Though not a ground breaking effort it's certainly worthy of serious listening. If you want Joplin played in a more traditional way there's plenty of that around. By the way, I recommend the Butch Thompson album as well."
2,Maple Leaf Drag,"I love Joplin, but this recording is a big disappointment. Roberts embellishes the music but seems to add little with his improvisation. He does not fully understand ragtime tempos. Worst of all, only half of the compositions are by Joplin. Try the CD by Butch Thompson."
5,Nice Set,I purchased this set as a gift. The person who received it is very happy with it and enjoying using it.
3,A fun romp through the sillyness of hollywood.,"Artistic Differences, by Charlie Hauck, is not the kind of book that will change your life or give you new insights into the human condition. That is why it only rates 3 out of 5 stars. However, if you liked the movie ""The Player"" or any other behind the scenes, satirical look at the ridiculous world of Hollywood then Artistic Differences will make you smile. From the beginning to the end, it is an over the top farce that is not meant to be taken too seriously and that is where it gets its charm. The characters are memorable (although stereotypical) and the plot moves along quickly as our narrator - writer/producer James Hoy - gives us a look at how bad decisions, out of control egos and rabid insecurity dictate what we watch on a typical sitcom. If you're in the mood for a light, sometimes biting, read then give this a try."
1,unhappy,The item that I ordered which was described as a blue CANVAS boat cushion turned out to be a blue NYLON boat cushion that I could have purchased at Wal-Mart for $7.00. After payin shipping I paid over $16.00 for the same thing. This is a boat cushion that I have been looking for and have been unable to find and I thought that I had found it here. I thought that after reading the description that I would get what was decribed... Not soTherefore I am Not happy with this service and will not use it again.
2,Thought this would be better made,"This cushion seems cheaply made. The innards consist of individual 1/8"" foam sheets, which result in the cushion lacking any substantive structure. Technically, it qualifies as a Type IV PFD. However, I only plan to use it as a last resort in emergencies. Doesn't look like it would hold up well as a seat cushion though."
2,Not helpful to alleviate night terrors,"If you are looking for a book to help you alleviate night terrors, this is probably not the book to read. The book claims to be a breakthrough program, but it offers very little guidance for alleviating them. The main author, who is a sufferer of night terrors, but not a doctor, goes to great lengths to support his claim that all adult night terrors must be caused by past trauma. It is imperative, he says, that a sufferer recognize that trauma (primarily child abuse) occured and to move on. If the reader doesn't buy into this assertion, then the rest of the book is really not helpful. I was hoping for more on how to alleviate night terrors, but this book came up short, in my opinion."
1,Not good,I didn't find this book helpful at all. The author maintains all the way through the book that night terrors are caused by traumatic child abuse and doesnt discuss anything other than this. This is not correct in my case which made the book completely useless. I don't recommend this to anyone. Probably the worst book I have ever purchased.
2,Options other than Napoleon's defeat.,"This was a hard book to read. I don't read much alternative history, simply because it is not true. I enjoy the academic debate of what might have happened if things were done differently. In this book, ten distinguished historians change some facts and show how things could have gone differently for Napoleon. Some of them are OK to read. The large majority have changed the scenario so completely that it is simply fiction. That is why I didn't like reading this book. It also may have been the reason for it being on the discount shelf.I am not sure of other alternative history for the Napoleonic era. However, readers could probably pick a better book from the thousands on Napoleon."
1,Do not buy this toy - will cause vomiting!,My poor year-old terrier tore pieces of this toy apart in a few minutes and ingested a few of the tiny fragments. A few hours later she vomited for half of the night - at least 12-14 times. Nothing else would have caused her to be sick - the toy was the only new addition to her nighttime routine. I emailed the company today about this product - it should be taken off the shelves. In no way should this chew toy be labeled safe and non-toxic!!!
5,Love this company!!,I love their products and will defninitly order from them again! They ship quickly and deliver as promised.
5,"A ""reader friendly' survey of facts and fables","An icon of legend, the Ark of the Covenant is the centerpiece of Jewish history and a long sought prize of Biblical Archaeology. Enduring mysteries such as the fate of the Ark and where it might be today continues to prod the imagination of scholars, theologians, archaeologists, and the general public. In Searching For The Ark Of The Covenant: Latest Discoveries And Research by Middle East expert Randall Price (Th.M. Old Testament and Semitic Languages) is a ""reader friendly' survey of facts and fables concerning the Ark, rumors and legends concerning it that span four thousand years of history across several continents and diverse cultures. Highly recommended reading, Searching For The Ark Of The Covenant is informed and informative, thoughtful and thought-provoking."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Let me sum up the book for you. The Ark is safe in the Temple Mount beneath the Holy of Holies, but you shouldn't look for it, instead you should spend your time searching for Jesus (the out-of-the-blue Jesus sales pitch on the very last page). His conclusion is based mostly on a story told to him by rabbis who went looking for it recently but didn't find it. Let's hear it for gut feelings. The Author does a good job derailing bogus theories of its location, while completely ignoring Oak Island (just one of many extraordinary possibilities for an extraordinary loss), or delving deep into the Crusaders time in Jerusalem (who may have attained it). Discounting the real Ark being in Ethiopia is easy...reading his awkward text is not. Lack of dates throughout the book make it difficult to know what time period he's speaking of. For a final laugh, enjoy the author's picture on the back cover."
3,Interesting but Tedious!!,"This is an excellent book for those interested in biblical topics, history, and archeology. However, at times I found myself ""up-to-my-eyeballs"" in facts! This is where the book really started to slow down. The endless scripture references, and other notes was frankly exhausting. Dr.Price's book is more a textbook than an average read. Now please don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the book. It's just something you might want to read a little at a time."
5,Something for everyone,"This is a collection, by various writers. Something for everyone. Might not like them all, but style and method are consistent."
2,Disappointing...,"These controllers quickly worked their way to the back of the lineup as far as which of my controllers get the most play time. They are really awesome looking, but they just stink! I take great care of them, but the turbo button will randomly activate, and the buttons will stop sensing unannounced, which is not good for something like ""Super Smash Brothers."" Anyone who plays with you more than once will quickly learn to not get stuck with one of these controllers if they want to win. The seller was great and they arrived on time, but the controllers just don't make the cut!"
5,"Thoughtful, Profound and Incredibly Readable","From the first line of Ruin, I was hooked. This is the kind of story that stays with you long after you finish the book. And I finished it in two sittings! I particularly loved the manhood ritual but I won't say any more about the story because I don't want to spoil it for you! What I will say is that all of the characters feel like flesh and blood; they come to life immediately. I read this book because a friend gave it to me, demanding I read it right away. I had never heard of Isobel Noble before, but I will be stunned if this book isn't a bestseller and its author isn't famous before the new year is out!"
4,Enjoyable with a couple missed twists,"I thought Tom Corcoran did a fine job with this Alex Rutledge Mystery. A good story, clever dialogue and a somewhat angled climax. I did think he missed a couple of opportunities to add in a needed twist, however it was still worth the read."
1,"Dry, Flat, and Boring","This author can write, so it is hard to believe that he could take a number of murders, attacks, shootings, and a car chase and chew them and chew them and chew them until there was no ""juice"" left. I got so impatient with the illogical fretting of the ""hero"" - that I skipped the last third of the book and went to the end to see who dunnit and why. Wish I had skipped that too since there was no satisfaction in it. I am greatful, however, to realize that this book was only one of a series and I have managed NOT to read the others. I congratulate myself for that!"
3,Typos galore,"I really like Tom Corcoran books, but this one has about a million typos! Who proofreads this stuff? A machine? I like to read, but this is not acceptable."
3,keep it simple,"The Key West stuff is great. The puzzle, however, demands a family tree and friendship chart. Our hero is always an observer with little action, maybe this will change."
3,Release the T.V. Series,"The dvd is great but for some reason they cant release the series. Though, if you really like this show then by this dvd to add to your collection."
4,SUMMERS BEST,IT is a dvd that sends you back in time when SUZANNE SUMMERS was in this persons opinion at her best. I just love Suzanne she is a very attractive actress. The dvd is as great as the show.
2,well done.....i thought,"duffy was at his best in this complimation i felt. Sommers could have played off JT and Cody better although i do not blame her as cody was doing time for the constant abuse of his spouse which somewhat tarnishes this complimation, all in all a good season ruined by some wayward fists."
2,Bring us the full season instead,"The show was great, 5 stars, and had a lot of fans. I'm sure full seasons would sell just fine. We don't need these ""trial-run"" sets to get us to buy."
2,not happy,"I ordered Step by Step the entire series from amazon, some seller they used, and I'm NOT happy with it. It came from China! The 3rd disc won't play!! It was just copied from TV, it has Christmas ads 4 movies on the bottom of the screen! Now I can't find that seller on here! NO KIDDING!!! I'm out over 75.00! RIP OFF!!"
2,I WANT THE FULL SEASON,"I really like step by step, but I want the full season.The show gets 5 starsThe dvd gets 2 starsI WANT IT KNOW!"
4,"Well, Some Of Them Are My Favorites",The Christmas episodes included on this DVD are some of my favorites of this series. The other ones were just okay.
1,Absolute trash,"This movie is so bad, I don't even really want to write a review about it. Take every dancing movie cliche, music video technique, and Jessica Alba, roll it up into a sickingly sweet 90 minute story and you get Honey which, despite its name, really stinks. Unless you are a big Jessica Alba fan, like Coyote Ugly, this movie is just way to lame once you get past the hot young female lead trying to make her way in life. I will repeat this over and over, little kids 99% of the time just ruin a movie. This holds true, with a annoying little kid that is suppose provide the cuteness, but I would prefer to see dribbled like a basketball and shot out of the movie. About the only kid I've seen in a movie that didn't annoy me was the little girl in Aliens. People need to stop putting little kids in movies! They are not cute! They are annoying!"
1,Why would Yolanda Adams agree to be on the soundtrack,of this very HORRIBLE movie?!That's all I have to say.
4,Honey,"Audiences' enjoyed Honey worldwide. The way that Jessica Alba expressed her character Honey thru dancing was also nice. The relationship that Honey and her mother had was average; on the other hand her mother didn't want Honey's life to be all about dancing. What her mother was doing without knowing was helping to create a better dancer out of Honey. When the celebrities were in the movie they did a nice job. Missy Elliot really brought her character to life. She was funny and had much attitude. When the children were dancing at the end, it showed how much Honey put her heart and soul into what she believed. I would of liked to see more of the end. I wanted to see what happened with Honey and all the dancers. There should have been forty-five minutes of life after they got the money. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I would encourage others to check it out also."
5,Love the movie!,"I like hip hop and stuff so I really enjoyed this movie! I was watching it w/a friend from work and her two yr old daughter and boy did her daughter move to the music! There are many amazing moves in this movie and I was wishing I had her moves. This was an inspiring movie and since I'm an emotional person, I almost cried. If you wanna learn moves, watch this! Jessica also inspired me to go for my goals in life like she did!"
4,Good for the whole family.,"Certainly not the most thought provoking movie, but entertaining, fun, and delivers a positive message to us all. It was refreshing to see young people having fun instead of the ubiquitous gangster stuff."
4,Dancing her way up the charts...,"i loved this movie. it combined the hip-hop flava with the ghetto. i love dance movies, and i think you have to, to enjoy this movie. the dance scenes were incredible with some hot new moves. the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because i didn't like how it ended, i wanted to see that director get what he deserved and honey cheorograph missy elliot's routine. that woulda been hott to watch. this was a great dance movie, but save the last dance still holds it's spot as the best dance movie of all time. i also feel that this movie coulda had a little more romance between honey and the baller, chaz, it woulda made it sexier."
4,Taste Like Honey!!!,Honey was indeed a good movie i just dont know why they compare it to you got served.Its whole different ball game in both movie especially honey.Honey is jessica alba who wants to make a break through in the dancing world you can call it but it just distracted by work and everything around her.If you watch the movie good the movie display about true events what really goes on in todays worlds especially with kids and young adults with talents.Theres alot of people like honey with mad talent it just its hard for them to get know because either it the environment there living in or the are distracted with other things that prevents them for achieving there goals.I really like they focus on Jessica Alba and others people around here cus it goes to show you never give up because the thing you are looking for it right there in front of you.
1,Terrible Movie,I am happy to say I didn't spend money on seeing this film in the movie theaters.The acting in the film is horrible. Alba was cast for her looks. Her acting in this film is soooo over the top I couldn't bare to watch anymore.The dancing was great and had me wishing I could move like that but everything else about the film... SUCKED!!!!!I would not recommend this movie to ANYBODY. Just terrible.
2,Arrogant DVD production,"Every menu option comes with a long intro. You can't skip the previews. It's ridiculous. Don't encourage such arrogance by buying it. (Sorry, Jessica -- I'm a huge fan.)"
1,Alba's SO talentless and tasteless...,"First off the movie-predictable, shallow with horrible acting. I knew that going in but figured Jessica alba would be worth it and my girlfriend liked it so I got the DVD... If you watch all the way through the outtakes the director sneaks in some footage of Jessica being really snotty to Lil' Bow Wow. ""Could you please stop touching me!"" she says to the playful boy on the set. That right there blows it for me."
1,Bittersweet Honey,"This DVD is truely dissapointing. The plot line takes a huge chip off ""Save the Last Dance,"" only difference between that movie and ""Honey"" is that the ""Save the last dance"" had a better plot line and talented actors, while ""Honey"" stars Jessica Alba, who was obvisouly casted for her sub-par looks and her worse then your high school cheesy production of romeo and juliet acting talents. The movie has as much pizazz as ""Glitter."" The plot line of the road to fame was not as easy as i thought it could be is getting really old. please don't waste your money on this junk."
1,Cliche To The Hilt,"An MTV/BET hybrid film starring Jessia Alba who was clearly chosen for her looks. It is my understanding that she had to be taught how dance which baffles me because the last time I checked Mya is a trained dancer and since acting skills were not a prime concern, she could have done the role. I think the change in casting alone could have saved this movie from the absolute trash heap into at least renting class. After all, there would have been some real reason to expand on the dancing. Beyond that gripe, the numerous cliches were overwhelming to the point where my 13 year old younger sister could stand no more."
1,Honey,This movie really sucks. The dancing was good but the story is really bad. Jessica Abla does not know how to act. She is very cheesie. She looks good but that about it. If i could give it a zero or worst i would.
3,Watch it for Jess and that's about it,"There are some good and slick moves no doubt but it pales when it comes to real dancing. Jessica looks pretty and hot but there are some silly little kids whom people are raving about particularly one kid whose move Jessica is supposed to have copied in one of her dance sequences in the movie (that's how the story goes). That was one sick lousy move and one that will make you cringe. Honestly that kid sucked. There are tons of kids on Mtv and other TV dance shows that will have your jaws dropping. Check it out for Jessica, otherwise this is no big ""dance-movie"". There's a sweet romance between Jess and her lover that is worth watching though. If you are looking for good drama and dance check out ""Save the Last Dance"".Wanted to give just 2 stars."
3,Slow-Moving But Inspiring,"Honey may be slow-moving and may be routine, however it is a very inspiring movie that gives out a message saying ""dreams do come true."" Honey is also a very fun film. It has a great soundtrack mixed with hot dance moves! A quite enjoyable film!"
5,The movie Honey was great!,I really liked this movie because I am so into hip-hop I am 12 years old and I have been taking hip-hop lessons since I was 3 years old! I think there should be more movies like Honey! I also liked this movie because I am such a big fan of Lilromeo and I always have been since he has came out! He is my rolemodel anyways I think the movie was incredible and for all those people that havent seen it you should right away because you will love it!
5,Great movie!!,"Great cast but Jessica Alba earns the movie the 5 stars, she did great and the movie is great because of her (and the rest of the cast) no matter what anyone says.It's a very fun movie, ALL THAT MATTERS!!If you like hip hop and you like a movie that has a positive message, you'll love the movie.If not, you'll probably still like it unless you're too stubborn to admit it.Thanks to all that made the movie!! You earned your money!"
5,gr8 movie,"this is a gr8 movie 4 a female teen age group. theres good music (hiphop mostly), hot guys, good dance routines n a good story line. this is tha kinda film that makes u jus wana get up n dance! its similar 2 save the last dance, which is anuva 1 of my faves...i jus cant chose between tha 2 now :S so wot if its original? its a wkd movie! luv jenn xx"
1,Pass on this movie.,Slow storyline and not really that much dancing. Jessica Alba is probably the ONLY saving grace in this movie. pass on it.
3,Historical Signifigance of Honey,"Why has everyone failed to acknowledge the wonderful actress Lonnette McKee who portrays Jessica's mother ....Someone who set the standard for all of todays young singers. Staring as ""sister"" in the original movie Sparkle.You should all be ashamed."
3,Not Bad,This movie did skip in places but over all i did get to watch most of it but I do wish I had known it skipped before I bought it.
3,Watchable,".... but haven't we already seen this in the 80's movie ""Flash Dance"" and recently in ""Save the last Dance"" which were all better than this but I like Jessica Alba and I liked the dance moves and that's what made me sit through this. I'd rent it rather than buy it."
3,I have to be honest!,"This movie reminds me of Flashdance, which was much better! Jessica Alba is gorgeous & perky & that is her appeal. However, nothing about her dancing is all that impressive that people should so desperately want her in their music videos & the plot line is so vey cliche. The charcters are just too...done before & the movie overall was kind of boring. If you want a good movie about an inspiring dancer who overcomes obsticles then you must rent the classic Flashdance."
2,Honey?,"Hmm let's see where shall i begin...basically to sum it up in a few words. Cliche, unrealistic, fake, bad dance moves and ummm yeah-cliche!"
2,Cheese comes with this Honey,"The cheesy HONEY has all the cliches right. Attractive bargurrrl with stars in her eyes gets discovered by a sleazy mentor who tries to blacklist her when she won't ""get with his program"". But the girl reaches inside herself, finds her ""inner spunk"", and shows everyone, including that evil Snidely Whiplash mentor that she has what it takes to make it after all. Add a hip-hop soundtrack featuring a few ""I'm gonna live my dream and you ain't gonna stop me"" songs, and the ususal ""street"" choreography, and you've got a movie that can be seen back-to-back with BREAKIN 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO."
3,Retarded,"This movie was a dancing movie. It is about a girl from the projects who achievs her passion for dancing....how interesting. really, c'mon, who da @$*k would wanna see that? the only reason i saw it is because jessica alba was HOT... but really it was like a chic flick. w.e"
2,alba yes movie no.,This is a marginal movie that tries to exploit albas obvious appeal. Its not memorable except as an on screen launching pad for ms albas career. It is not fair to judge an actress only for first performances that can bring attention to her overall potential. I know she is very talented.I realize that sometimes these movies are inevitable.However she has already proven herself in dark angel.I will wager that her next moves will be to try a variety of concepts leading to big screen success.In the end i do not blame her for a foolishly made production by hollywood copycats.She is super. The movie?- is your decision. now you know mine.thank you !!
1,It sucks the life out of you!,"Wow, so I only watched this movie because my siblings rented it. Needless to say, they're 13 and 14 and they didn't even enjoy it. What the hell name is ""Honey"" anyway? And if Jessica Alba is so all about being ""Latina"" what is she doing pretending to be half black?? Good Lord her stupid fake little ghetto accent drove me nuts! Her dancing isn't even good. And the ""streets"" in the movie weren't even bad. Plus shouldn't ""the kids'"" focus be on education instead of having their life goal be a background booty dancer for a rap video? If you enjoy seeing a skinny fat-lipped white girl shake her non-existent ass up in the club this movie is for you!"
3,wheres the 3rd disc?,The blu-ray copy of this dvd was fine. I enjoy anything that DX did. The problem i had was the item on the web page said that this was a 3 dvd pack and the price reflected it. I was very disapointed when i recieved the item & it actually had only 2 discs. I returned the item and got a refund. I see that Amazon has since changed the web page and now it shows that there are in fact only 2 discs. I would have kept the item if i knew that now i have to reorder the dvd all over again.
2,Some Of The WORST Wrestling skits ever!,"DX is a faction that appeared in the late 90's and had some fantastic and memorable moments in their glory days. Yet, in 2009-10 wrestling has changed to a more family friendly product, taking away a lot of what made DX great. What we're left with is a collection of very corny skits and not a lot of overall excitement. Pretty lame. I will say, there are a few good wrestling matches on here, like Survivor series 2009, but there is nothing here that makes it a must own or that you can't get elsewhere on a stronger WWE release. If you're a DX fanatic, then by all means complete your collection. Casual and even collector fans can skip. Your money is better spent on a different title. Just my 2 cents."
3,Good DVD For DX Fans,"My son liked this DVD...he is a WWE GX fan. Of course, GX no longer exists because Shawn Michaels retired."
3,Trigger Point video,Could be more informitive if it has better camera angles. You can not see where the hands are most of the time. What a waste of time to film in such an unprofessional way.
4,A Great Contemporary Introduction to Jesus the Savior,"Placher presents us with a very mature reflection on how and why Jesus is our Savior. He discusses the person of the man named Jesus and also the work of the God-man refusing to separate either, but keeping them intimately and intractibly connected. This would be a very valuable book for a Sunday School class or even for a special study during Vacation Bible School, for example. Placher's contribution here is wonderful. My only criticism is that I would have like to have seen or felt more passion from Placher about the Savior that is he writing about. Though this is an easier read than T. F. Torrance's The Mediation of Christ--you get a sense in that book of Torrance's evangelical fervor for the Savior, where the same passion seems lacking in Placher's book. Should that be the case? We are talking about the person, Jesus Christ, to whom we owe everything."
5,The Wierd Al of Country Music,"This is an absolutely fabulous CD - definitely one of his best. Cledus is not a good singer, by any standard, but the lyrics to his songs are hysterical. This is a CD for both country fans and their opponents. You don't need to know the original song to appreciate Cledus' version. For example (She's got a butt) Bigger than the Beatles - a great song about overeating. And If Shania was Mine - great lyrics, including ""Oh, I'd love to seduce her, but she married her producer. Now all I can do is pray (pray) she'll get a divorce someday...If Shania was mine..."" In any event, this CD is definitely worth the money and the time -- the humor will definitely take your mind off your troubles.*There are a few songs that are more adult material -- for example The Change (a song about a sex change -- which I might add, is hilarious) and 1-900-Sheila (just look at that title)."
5,Undone? I say WELL done.,"This book is hilarious! It kept all of my children laughing for hours. I have three kids, ages 2 1/2, 5, and 11. My oldest is a bit slow, due to some learning disabilities, but my youngest is smart as a whip. The middle one is of average intelligence but has a terrific sense of humor. He loved it the most, though they all ask me to read it every night. They giggle uncontrollably every time I turn the page and my oldest is always asking, ""why Med mad?"" (The character's name is Ned but she can't pronounce her N's yet.)A perfect book for kids of all ages, and totally entertaining for parents too! It's funny, clever, and easy to read over and over again. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a children's book this much."
5,undone & unbelievably funny (when you're six),"Ian Lendler has joined the many children's authors attempting to revamp the fairy tale for the contemporary age. He has succeeded. Admirably. My [...] daughter thinks it's the funniest book we own, never realizing she's getting messages about independence, the risks & benefits of culinary skills, & battle tactics. I read it to her kindergarten class (alright, the read-aloud version of this book is becoming more like performance art than a quiet bedtime story) & had them hooked. It also has enoughlittle details to prevent the boredom of endless repetition. Because this book will be read again & again."
2,no indexing,If you don't want to spend any money for this book you'll get the text and that's it. The book is all here and readable. There just is no indexed table of contents.
1,excellent seller,Seller was great received item quickly. the book itself was dull. lots of better stuff out there. try reading Sophie. it's a historical fiction on the development of philosphy.
1,Better Business Bureau rates PQI as unsatisfactory.,"I purchased a PQI memory card and it died after about two months.Although PQI advertises a lifetime guarantee on their memory products and their website has you fill out an RMA request form and email it to them as an attachment, the email address they give is invalid. All subsequent emails to PQI regarding the invalid email address and warrantee processing were not responded to.According to the Better Business Bureau ""this company has an unsatisfactory record""."
1,what happend why?????????,"These speaker suck they have no bass at all i misread something saying that they are good speakers the secound time i hooked them up they broke the blue light power signal just went off! I went so far that i opeaned the speakers to see something that i can fix, but thier was nothing broke inside it all looked new, so i had no coice but to trash them......DO NOT BUY"
4,"Excellent for developing intuition, but that's about it","I took Biometry as a course at Stony Brook with Rohlf. I think the book does an excellent job at building a conceptual understanding of what different statistical techniques are used for. Coming out of the course (which was essentially Rohlf reading his book to us), one develops an excellent ability to look at an experiment and determine what type of analysis should be done. This is pretty damn important. What the book fails to do is, once you know which test to use, help you analyze your data using popular statistical programs. Other texts (e.g., Tabachnik and Fidel) appreciate that knowing which test to use is only half the battle. Biometry is weak at helping you actually run tests.One great stength of Biometry is its treatment of non-parametric data. It is by far the best treatment I have seen in an introductory text. I would highly recommend this book to anyone whose data violates assumptions of the typical ANOVA model."
4,What people hate about Wall Street,"The authors do a good job describing some of the mechanics and BS that goes on on Wall Street. I thought it was refreshing to see a guy who lived it come clean on some of the crap that goes on on W.S. Wander what the dope-smoking hippies are protesting now (Oct 2011)?Well, so do they, but they should protest lack of enforcement of insider info, lack of morality and the overall stinch of lots of smart, uber-greedy scumbags who would sell their mother, their country or God himself to be the new BSD. The book is a great read, I recommend it."
4,"There's no right or wrong, just money ...","I found this book to be more of a dairy than confessional. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but the theme was set early on, ""My colleagues aren't playing fair and I'm still going to take the money.""Because the author is documenting real events, it was refreshing to get an insiders perspective on WorldCom's lifecycle. In particular, as a CNBC viewer, the talking heads are always tossing around ... ""former head of Citigroup ..."" and several of these players show up in the book. So that was a value added aspect that I enjoyed.The thing I found funny was that the last page of the book pretty much sums it up. I did pick up a few trading notes but things were drawn out in the later half of the book. Enjoy."
5,Inside the convoluted web of greed but no fear,"A fantastic account of one brilliant, talented, and hardworking man's ascent from Buffalo to the hallowed halls of Wall Street. In spite of the great views, the fantastic parties, the private jets, and the great pay it appears to have been a lonely trip. The account is that of the only honest guy on the street. The other analysts will do anything to get a piece of the cheese. Here's the story of one man's ethical struggle against a system that proclaims loudly, "" GREED IS GOOD"". The account is honest and forthright. Many of the stories are outrageously funny. The book is enjoyable and reads quickly. Make sure you buy it for your kid in college who aspires to be, "" An Investment Banker."""
4,Citizen,"Very informative and revealing.Entertaining disclosure of moral,character and intellectual failures of a human being.Clear picture of the banking system where intellectual mediocracy were able to succeed.Not literary well written, but good and solid account of greed and deception."
4,View from a former colleague...,"The book is remarkably detailed, and well researched. A great read. You conveyed the emotion well. Also, I never realised quite how weird the whole Jack Grubman thing was!It was nice to work with you Dan. I trust you are enjoying your retirement, and if you ever read this, feel free to contact me via Justin at CSFB or Vic (now at Chevreux)."
2,Disappointing!,"I read ""Confessions of a Wall St. Analyst"" expecting to learn about sophisticated scams that cheat investors. Instead, I learned little other than Reingold dislikes fellow analyst Jack Grubman; his other main points - the obvious conflict between analyst research and marketing of new issue services, and the unreal salaries paid those involved in investment banking - are old news.Not worth reading."
2,Telecom analyst with No Inside Information is better title,"Not a confessional but a career recount of a telecom analyst who denies having inside information and who had limited participation in transactions and little or no solo face time with infamous execs. Books by employees that witnessed first hand the financial wrongdoing, who knew the execs involved or by journalists who uncover shocking facts are more compelling reads.The story is that before Regulation FD, when insider information was less regulated he was paid big bucks to be a telecom analyst and does nothing to rectify bad behavior. He focuses on his raises and on another analyst, the Moby Dick character. Nothing, not even telecom analysis or his firm secrets is ""uncovered"" ,The real shocker is how the title can breed such a banal non-story."
3,Not So Bad After All,"The first time I heard the CD I wasn't too impressed, except the ""No Matter What"" song was great. But as I listen to it more, I am liking it more and more"
4,More pleasing than most,"I bought this album after hearing 'No Matter What' on the ALW Celebration video, and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the singing. This group deserves more attention, especially with the ability to do vocal effects like the chorus on ""And I"". The songs are meaningful, and have enough distinct qualities that you don't get the effect you hear sometimes listening to the radio - the vague feeling that you're listening to the same song regurgitated over and over again. They are limited only by the confines of the pop music genre - and I hope to find that they break these limits in other CDs."
5,A must have!!!!,"Keating has an unmistakable, unique sound that will make him one of the most influential musicians of the nineties - a 90's version of Sting! Their sound is great, lyrics delightful, and Keating.......just edible!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought the CD for myself, not for my 10 yr old daughter, and my 3 yr old son and I watch their video of their Manchester concert on an almost daily basis."
5,"Talented, good-looking... some words to describe Boyzone",All though I've been a fan of theirs for ages.. this must be some of their best work!!! I hope (along with the 5 guys) that this album will break them into the US market.. so far they haven't =(!! Buy this album and you'll be blown away with their soft lulling voices!!!!! I love them more and more each new single and album- they just keep getting better!!!
5,fantastic,i think this cd is really good. bz seems to have matured a lot since they started out and this really shows in this album. i love it.
3,"Corny, but not bad.","This is the first Boyzone album that I heard, and although the songs can be a bit corny, the vocals are pretty good. Ronan has a great voice, and he and Steven compliment each other. My fav tracks are ""No Matter What"" (penned by the great Andrew Lloyd Webber), ""Where Did You Go"" and ""I Love The Way You Love Me."" This is a very listener friendly album and my Mother loves it more than I do, so don't be afraid to purchase it as a gift for your Mom, girls!! Have fun listening!!"
1,"No, no, No!","The only reason anyone should buy this is because they fancy one of the band members (Stephen is my Favorite..) But, I'm afraid, It's trash.."
3,not great,"The name of this band should be ""Ronan Keating...and company."" He completely dominates all the songs. I would say that's fine but this is supposed to be a group effort. GROUP RONAN! That means you let other people sing! Everybody else is basically backup singers who get their faces on the over of the album. Stephen Gately is the real star of this group. His voice is so pure and beautiful next to Ronan's. Here's a tip for everybody. If you like Ronan you'll LOVE Bryan Adams. Go buy Stephen Gately and Bryan Adams's albums and skip this one."
2,I must be the only one,"from the reviews I've seen so far, everyone seems to love this album. I do not fancy this at all. I didn't pay much for it and yet I still feel jipped. This album was more than bland and lacking in originality. The single song that was worth it was 'Picture of You' which I love. But that's about it. Boyzone does nothing for me. If you're looking for ballads and plain cookie cutter music, look no further than here."
1,Horrid,"They are not any better than the Back Street Boys or NSync, and actually they are much worse."
1,Pants!,Speaking as a resident of the country in which Boyzone are most famous I feel that I have more rights than most to comment on them. To do so I feel that I have to use just one word: shite! They are all bony arsed bog men!!!!!!!
3,Different music,I bought the cd because it had one very fitting song on it. I like oldies music and three of these songs are pretty decent; my daughters would like the rest !
1,The opposite from their case production,Silverstone makes phenomenal computer cases/enclosures. I assumed that the cables would carry the same attention to detail and quality that goes into their case manufacturing. I ordered 5 of these cables for an htpc build where 4 were to be used for two raid 1 arrays and the 5th was to be used for a dvd drive/burner. The slightest amount of side to side pressure on the cable ends while seated in the motherboard or hard drives will cause the cap sides to break off. This makes the cable unusable as it will no longer remain seated in the drive or motherboard. Don't make the same mistake that i did. I broke 3 of these cables from the pressure of just plugging them in. I have used $1 budget cables with better durability which is sad considering these come in at $7 a piece. You do not get what you pay for in this case.
4,"Hot, tight Celtic guitar","If you're a fan of Celtic guitar or a guitarist yourself, do yourself a favor by purchasing this disk. When I hear Tony McManus play, I get vicarious blisters on my fingers. He does this triplet thing with his right hand that is bloody amazing! There's one medley of songs on the CD that includes a version of ""The Rakish Paddy"" that would make Pierre Bensusan sweat. As a guitarist myself, listening to this CD is both inspiring and disheartening at the same time...he makes stellar technique sound easy."
4,The queen of brazilian torch songs was a gay favorite.,"Some call her old fashioned with her dramatic voice and her torch songs, some inspired in her own life. But Dalva was great in her style, and she was a queen in the early fifties, the great brazilian radio star before Bossa Nova. This CD shows 21 songs where she exposes her emotion and her strong voice in Edith Piaff's and Libertad Lamarque's style.Recomended for Almodovar's admires and gays in general.She died in 1973 with 56 years old."
5,"Mental, mental, chicken oriental","Shooglenifty have redefined Scottish music, the hard edged techno sound is the perfect backbeat to celtic tunes"
5,pipe track rocks!!,"I REALLY like the start to this album, an incredibly catchy tune called John McKenzie's Fancy by J. Barrie. I noticed that this tune is also on Robin Bullock's album, ""Midnight Howl""Midnight Howland on the World Pipeband Championships 1983 album. A truly great tune!"
5,Excellent Book!,This book was great! The author is such an excellent artist with really unique techinics and he truly expresses his insight. A really great assest and a great job!
3,Inspiration,"This is a book to inspire creation of art through photography and in depth follows the authors rational proving vision can be brought to fruition. The book does not waste our time demonstrating how to use Photoshop, rather it shows what Photoshop is capable of and could be seen as more of a portfolio a'la coffee table. Too often the images use repetitive parts and left/right mirror images resulting in vulvaforms better suited to Judy Chicago's ""Dinner Party"". The faint, fine print makes for difficult reading. The book does not indulge the author by trying to impress us with his knowledge of keystroke shortcuts; he explains how logically to find and use the various tools."
3,Philosophical Photoshop Book,"I think few people are writing textbooks which try to teach the philosophy and critical thinking portions of digital editing and retouching, and for this effort, Caponigro should be praised. Unfortunately, the text gets somewhat preachy and self-indulgent in some places. I'm not sure that the author selected a specific audience for this book, and therefore it is hard to suggest the book to anyone."
2,"Good intent but poorly written, too long, few clear examples","Mr. Caponigro may have started with the best of intentions but his writing is so bad, you have to strain to get through the material. He takes too long getting to the point and provides so little clear direction or examples, that I'm left only with his sense of self-importance, not information about Photoshop. If the he had let an editor shorten the book by half and provided more clear steps/information about using Photoshop, I would have indulged him more, but as it is, this book is of very little use for someone wanting to expand their Photoshop skills. Its the author being spiritual and groovy way past the point of usefullness."
2,unhelpful at best,"Strange that a book on photography has images so small I needed to use a loupe! The text is small as well. And the writing is longwinded, and directionless--in short it is a chore to read. I didn't find much inspiration in it either, as his photos are very reminescent of Jerry Uelsman as well as surrealist painters so I fail to understand the raves of this book. I thought Photoshop Artistry was a much better book."
5,How an artist uses Photoshop,"I first saw John Paul Caponigro's images 3 years ago and thought he was an exceptional artist. His book describes some of the Photoshop techniques he uses to create his art, a melding of traditional photography with digital techniques. I especially enjoyed the chapters on creating atmospheric perspective, compositing images, creating shadows and generating symmetry. He also offers a different perspective on how to use many of the Photoshop tools.This is not a book for a beginner wanting to learn Photoshop ('Classroom in a Book' is my suggestion), nor perhaps for an intermediate (I recommend 'Photoshop Artistry') but for someone who is familiar with the program and who wants to learn the techniques of a highly skilled artist 'Master Class' is a good choice. Some may find his musings on his artistic choices too Zen-like but if you like his art you'll probably love the book. I certainly did."
5,A book to bring your skills to new levels.,"To sum of us Photoshop is more than a tool but an experience. Photoshop allows the creator to expand on their vision. To grow past the limitation of the analog and into a domain that has few visual limitations. This book is a great guide to that experience. I had the good fortune of seeing Mr. John Paul Caponigro lecture several years ago ;hence, was very pleased with the completion of his book. He opened my eyes and my mind to concepts and capabilities both at his lecture and with the book. The book is detailed, insightful and revealing. However, It is not a document for the beginner but for someone that wanted to expand their creative skill to a level they did not know was there."
3,Good techniques but mostly about vision and esthetics,"I too found the very thin and light type of this book very hard to read. However, after vowing to slog through it anyway, I found the discussions of the techniques to be well done. The problem, which can be viewed as either good or bad depending on your bend of mind, is that the author takes the reader on his personal journey of discovery of digital art. And personal journeys takes a long time and are somewhat boring for anyone else but the person himself. Starting from a photography background, I found the artistic point of view interesting, even educational and inspiring, but too much of a good thing. After a while, I started skimming the main text and reading the 'methods' summary at the end of each chapter which spelled out the techniques in a nutshell."
1,Master class snooze book,"I admit that there is alot of content in the book, but i feel like i am reading someones personal journal. .... As one other review said "" ""Master Class"" is 50% philosophy..."" all that philosophy just turns me off, and makes me feel like he is talking down to me at every step. If you want to combine photography and photoshop then perhaps this books for you, but if you want to do anything else with Photoshop then select another book.If the book had not been a text book I never would have bought it, and for the first time in my life I might just sell it back at the end of the semster.There are better Photoshops books, there just has to be! ..."
1,Caution,"I found myself looking up ""wrong"" answers and finding disagreements between this study guide and standard reference texts. I stopped using it early in Chapter 1 (I.M.)."
1,"Unfortunately, not TWAIN-compatible","I make my living developing software for controlling scanners, and a very basic test shows that the FS-531 (as of December 6, 2004) has a pathetically broken TWAIN driver. I say ""pathetically"" because very basic software testing by Syscan would have revealed this bug before the FS-531 was released. If you only use this scanner from Photoshop or similar programs, it may well work - I can't say. If you attempt to use it with an automated scanning application, it will very likely crash (fatal error) - it will depend on the exact TWAIN features used by the application. This baffles me, since I would think that is exactly the type of application it would be *designed* to work with."
4,Illustrated dictionary,"This dictionary with simple, clear illustrations is an essential componenet to any understanding of Hawaiian words and language. Especially geared for beginners and children, this dictionary covers alot of ground. While not being too technical or cumbersome, it is an enjoyable book to use."
5,Great Hawaiian Dictionary,"I am serving a mission in Samoa and wanted to compare this language to Hawaiian. This dictionary is perfect. Every definition includes a sample sentence demonstrating the way the word is used. I could probably learn basic Hawaiian from this book alone. Fantastic - couldn't be happier.I'll be looking for a self-instruction course in Hawaiian as soon as I finish mastering Fa'aSamoa, but I only wish there was as good a Samoan dictionary as this one."
5,Fake News is Back,"The Onion is one of the most consistently hilarious publications ever made. With a combination of cynicism and erudition and a seemingly endless creative ability the writers of the Onion constantly churn out stories that make fun of our country, leaders, way of life, beliefs and more for the truly best of intentions: To make us laugh.The latest installment includes a year's worth of comic gold. One of my favorite articles is the one about America's King returning from exile. Great stuff. For anyone who likes high-minded humor that one doesn't necessarily need to be 'high-minded' to love, I would recommend this and all the other Onion books. Regardless of your politics, religion, race, etc. you will surely find some great stories in here."
3,decent....,"This Onion book is okay, but I found Vol. 13 to be much funnier...the best story I've found in this book so far is the one about the Mexican-Canadian overpass..."
5,Revealing indeed !,"I knew of this book when I was a teenager and had always wanted to get a copy of my own. Thanks to Amazon here it is ! This book was very revealing to me in relation to the existance of a Pre-Adamic race of humaniods. This race eventually were judged and destroyed by God before the Garden of Eden due to their joining with Satan through the occult. These eventually became the demons of the Bible. Demons are not ""fallen angels"" but rather disembodied spirits of these pre-adamic races. Interestingly enough, this book also not only counteracted against Spiritualism but also again the theory of evolution itself, which was becoming popular in the late 19th Century. It is a must read for everyone in the 21st Century."
3,Thought Provoking,This book has some interesting ideas about Earth's history. However you need to remember that it's up to you to do your own study in light of the information we have today.
1,How Typical,"Interesting book. However typical of nineteen century man this book presents clear prejudice towards women and womanhood diminishing her role by putting her in subjective, submissive role. I do not think that the writer was illuminated by Spirit of God as one reviewer puts it, as I do not thik that any writer is when aside from providing the reader with strictly scholarly work he is bending the words of scriptures to his own prejudices adding his own views. Do not recommend reading unless the reader is interested in the way the mind of a nineteen century man presents itself."
2,Is this an abridged edition?,"I first got a digitalized early edition (1889) from the Open Library and after reading a few pages decided to buy this one from Amazon. It was a surprise to find that this new edition left the ""Introduction"" out of it. Would that be because in it the author criticizes the divisions among Christians and the false doctrines that were brought in by men? How can I be sure that the rest of the book was not ""censured"" to please the ""churches"" systems and their religious leaders? (my rating is for this edition, not for the book that I am still reading)."
5,Great Book,"Not to be read at a fast pace, at least not by me. But, overall a very good thought provoking book."
5,Mind-bending!,"Not for the faint of heart! Uncovers the deep past and gives understanding ot King Solomon's statement, ""Nothing is new under the sun!A hard, old english read, but worth it."
1,No Technical Support!!!,"I returned this product due to not being able to get any technical support from Epson!!! I never got this printer installed, so I do not know how it works. I tried for 2 weeks to get technical support, by phone and email. After 2 weeks I decided I better return item because I felt that I would have a product that the manufacturer did not care about helping customer who bought it. I will never purchase anything that comes from Epson. Absolutely, no customer service or support from this company."
3,Good Value for Money,"The printer is a great value for the price. It is quiet, compact size, prints very well. My only complaint is the black ink is used up quickly and it prints slower than expected. But other than this I feel it was definitely work the money. Thank you."
4,great printer for the price,"Versatile printer - does not require paper stock to fold acutely during printing like many other printers (particularly important for card stock printing such as covers). Will do descent photos, but of course not like a specialized photo printer (check out its dot size). Holds up very well over time with fairly heavy use. Ink usage is certainly no heavier that other major brands. The printer has always been very Mac friendly thru all of the operating systems over the last five years. The bad reviews by some I have read here must represent lemons."
1,Highly unreliable & broke little over a year,"I have been using Epson printers for more than 20 years, starting with their dot-matrix models. This is the most unreliable of it all. A few months after purchasing, gaps started to appear in the output & cleaning the nozzles did not help. Little bit over 1 year, the printer completely broke down. In addition, never able to get the driver to work on Windows Vista so it was always a guessing game (& complete waste of money), when it comes to buying ink replacements."
4,Cautious about C88+,"I have only recently installed this printer. It is being used with caution..My reason for this is that I bought a C88 printer from Amazon, but within a few weeks, the magenta jet became clogged and to this day, having tried everything possible, it remains clogged.However, I did not give up on Epson as I continued using the Epson C86 which eventually died after two (2) years. Then I installed the Epson C88+ printer.It is now under observation. I believe that it may be an improvement on the C88, but I have to wait and see. In the meantime I purchased another C88+ printer from Amazon, which I will keep in the event of the present C88+ breaking down.....Barton"
1,Driftwoodco: seller of e-waste,"I bought a used Epson stylus C-88+ color printer from driftwoodco for a project. The project was delayed so I didn't buy the cartridges right away. After a couple of months I needed the printer and when I set it up with ink it did not print. Nothing. Nada. When I emailed driftwoodco, they did not reply to my email. No acknowledgement whatsoever. Outside this printer looked good with original labels on it, but inside it was dirty. My guess is that they did not test it to see if it worked and just sent it to me. Now I am stuck with their re-packaged e-waste and I have to pay to dispose of it after it never printed a single page!!!! Driftwoodco is the worst supplier I have used on Amazon."
1,My Epson PhotoStylus became a Boat Anchor,Warning! Epson is very aggressively trying to stop the use of compatible ink cartridges by changing the chips in the cartridges that their printers will accept. My PhotoStylus now refuses to accept ANY new cartridges (even Genuine Epson cartridges) after only 2 years of very light use. Epson refuses to answer emails on the subject and I have no choice but to throw this printer in the trash and buy another one! I'm looking at Lexmark and Brother this time and I recommend you do the same.
3,Replacement C88,"My selection of our original C88 maybe 7 years ago was it's relatively rare (even then) parallel port which I needed in a failed attempt to salvage an old DOS database program. That printer went bad and my replacement was based on the fact it was cheaper than throwing out the spare cartridges I had for the original machine. It's a 4 cartridge system so the colors are adequate although not optimum--not a big deal as we have two other more capable inkjets on our network. Still--for $80+, it's a relative bargain"
3,As expected,"A connector cord - pc to printer was not included in shipping package. Fortunately, I had one and did not brave a snow storm to be up and running when the C88 I was using, finally stopped working.This is the 3rd or 4th Epson C88 that I have owned. I use it because I can set preferences to black ink only and print in text. Print ink is too expensive and the unit shipped has a different cartridge design than previous models. Hopefully, the extra ink cartridges that I purchased at a computer show will work."
4,Epson C88+,So far so good...just hope it lasts longer than the previous C88+ printer. I chose the same model because it is the only one that has all the qualities I want/need. The Epson ink is too costly and they fix it so that any other ink will not work or gums things up.Epson Stylus C88+ Ink Jet Printer (C11C617121)
3,Epson C88+ printer,"Gives beautiful prints but the ink cartridges are small. Especially the black, which is the workhorse of any printer. I went through a black cartridge in about two weeks. The Photos are clear and color-accurate, and can be borderless. The pics of our cat showed every hair as clear as a bell(she's black). I've always used Epson printers, and hope I get the same results from this one."
2,epson:creating for failure?,"i have had a c84 and c86 and tho i love the printer when it is working, they seem to consistently become inoperable by at most year but often in less time! my last printer i had hardly used and it failed. They wanted me to send it somewhere in yonkers but sorry for me if they cant fix it! that is unacceptable to me, it seems a scam to insure purchasing - i am now looking into other kinds of printers."
4,Prints Fast!,"This is my second Epson Stylus. The one I purchased before is now a discontinued model but I wanted another reliable printer so I went with the newest model, the Stylus C88."
4,Espon printer - great output for the $$$$,"I have had many of the C80 series and they all have been great. They don't last all that long, but for the money totally worth it. I am replacing an Epson R320 that I HATED. This is working out much better."
4,Be SURE to run it once a week,"A good printer but prone to clogging if you don't use it enough. Once a week, print a color picture on ANY kind of paper. The head cleaning mechanism in the printer is only so-so."
5,Solid Printer,"I had an Epson C84 for several years. Finally the service life expired. While the C88 may not be the latest technology (All-In-One), it does exactly what I want. It prints dependably and economically and refill cartriges are easily obtained."
5,Epson Stylus c88 Great printer,"Epson Stylus C88+ Ink Jet Printer (C11C617121). I had an Epson Stylus 888 for eight years and loved it, When I recently had to replace it, I searched for printers and ended up at the Epson site. All I needed was just a printer. After reading the product reviews, I settled on the Epson Stylus c88+. It turned out to be a great choice. The printer is much better and easier to use than the old Stylus 888. Although there are 4 ink cartridges, thet are reasonably priced and easily accessible; even on the web. I like the fact that each color has a cartridge, which means I don't have to replace a multi-ink cartridge if the red runs out. The only thing I don't like is the fact that if i turn it on from my surge protector/switch panel, I still have to reach over and additionally turn on the printer; the on/off switch does not remain in the on position. The Amazon.com site offered the best price, free shipping and I had it in less than 3 days.Overall a thumbs up product."
5,Good basic printer for the price.,"If you're looking for a good photo printer. This isn't it. If you're looking for a basic printer that can print documents, resumes, and flyers. It can work for both Vista, XP, Linux, and Apple OS 10.4, 10.5. Good printer."
3,Epson Stylus C88+ Ink Jet Printer,"The Epson Stylus C88+ Ink Jet Printer has out performed another Epson printer I owned previosly. I researched printers quite a bit before I settled on the Stylus C88+ and for the low cost, it is fine for text printing. I have not tried it yet as a photo printer. The ink cartridges do not run out as quickly as other people have mentioned."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"This printer is horrible! Goes through black ink faster than any other printer I've ever owned. I've had this printer for less than a month and have not printed an obscene amount of documents; however, I am already on my THIRD black ink cartridge. Not worth it! Very slow as well."
4,"Great printer, sharp printing.","When my 9-year old Epson Photo 820 needed replacing, I just needed a good color printer, not a photo one this time. This one so far has fit the bill. Have not printed a photo yet, only text - which has always been sharp.Meets my needs for a dependable color printer. Has seperate inks for each color which I wished my 820 had that during its day.Easy setup for Win 7, as the driver is included in Win 7."
2,Our last Epson printer,"Pros:Good hardware, decent print quality.Cons:Not at all Mac friendlySlow as molassesRuns out of ink quickly, cartridges are expensiveThe worse feature is it won't let you print if any of the ""convenient individual"" cartridges are out. That means if you're printing b/w and yellow is out, it won't print.To add insult to injury, if you shake the ""empty"" cartridges you can easily hear ink in them."
1,It's a trap!!,"Please don't buy this printer. Every time I try to use it it wants new cartridges. If you only print in B&W this printer sucks. The color cartridges dry out, and then you have to replace them anyway because the printer wont let you print without all of the cartridges full. If you don't use the printer for a couple weeks the cartridges dry out and you have to replace them. It's absolute crap."
1,Be aware of ink issues before you buy,Be aware that Epson engineers its ink-jet printers to use small amounts of the color inks even when you only print in black and white. Eventually one or more of the color cartridges will run out and the printer WILL NOT WORK until you buy new cartridges - even if you have never used color.
1,I always loved Epson printers until I bought the C88,"I bough my first Epson printer in 1995 and it lasted for 10 years. So when it came time to replace it, I went with Epson again.I bought the Epson C88 based on the recommendations here and it stopped working after one year: The print heads just stopped working and I tried everything to get them working again: cleaning, replacing the ink cartridges, etc. Another reviewer stated that this printer wasted ink and that is also true. I have never seen a printer go through so much ink in my life."
4,Great Printer,I replaced my old C88 with the same model because it gave good service for a long time of constant use.
4,"Good price, good product!",The item was received quickly and in perfect condition. Easy to set up. The colors are magnificent. Having a little trouble with the feeder/could be operator error. But I love this machine and the price was right.
2,"Good Quality, But Goes Through Ink Unbelievably Quickly","My printer arrived today. I printed about 25 pages on the text setting and already my black ink level is at 50%. I've been using Epson products for years and understand that their ink goes quickly--and their cartridges are very expensive (4 required cartridges cost approximately $50-$55)--but I've never experienced anything like this. The quality is good, but only get this printer if you don't print very often, otherwise it isn't worth it. I regret this purchase already."
2,Already having printing problems after 3 days.,"I'm already having printing problems with the Epson c88+ purchased through Amazon after only having used it for three days. It prints as if it already needs cleaning; and it continually has a problem pulling the paper through. Another minor detail, but a hassle to work with, is that the paper support backer keeps falling out."
5,Epson C88+ Inkjet Printer,"I had an Epson C88 for years and it finally showed its age, so I ordered the Epson C88+ and am surprised at the improvement on an already great and cheap product. I would recommend this printer to anyone. I have been a computer consultant for 22 years, so I think I know what I am talking about."
3,Printer okay; Epson customer support not okay,"This is the third in this series of printers I've owned. They don't last long, but the price is modest. I wouldn't have bought this one but for the fact that the last C88 died just after I replaced all the cartridges at a cost that nearly equals the printer cost. The new C88+ wouldn't recognize the cartridges from the old C88 even though they are the same cartridges sold for the C88+. I have always received superior customer support from Epson. This time, however, I talked with two people who were obviously shuffling pages in a book and reading canned responses that didn't address the problem. An e-mail response to my dilemma arrived 3 days after my request and was similarly not on point. I needed to print, and was forced to toss the cartridges from the C88 and install new ones. Essentially that doubled the cost of the new printer. It'll be my last Epson."
1,Ink Cartidge Usage Problems,"We have two Epson C88+ printers which we bought because their price seemed reasonable. We are very unhappy with these because of their ink cartridge usage. First of all the cartridges are expensive. Next, we constantly having to clean the nozzle heads or align the heads to prevent gaps from appearing in the printed documents. This cleaning/aligning uses much more ink so the cartidges don't last as long as they should. By the time we get everything printing well, it is time to replace the cartridges. Lastly the printer stops printing if even one cartridge is out of ink. You cannot even print in only black if (say) the yellow is out. Several times when replacing the cartridges, I would shake the ""empty"" cartridge and it sounded like there was still plenty of ink left. I am wondering if their monitor get confused at times and reports a cartridge empty when it is not. By the way, BOTH printers exhibit the same behavior."
5,Great printer,"I purchased this printer to replace an Epson C84 model that did not want to work any more! I purchased this item, one because my aunt has the exact same one and I love how it prints, and two, that it is an Epson printer! It fits exactly where the other one did, and it prints like a gem! I will always stick with Epson! They make great products that work for a very long time!"
2,"Limited Media Types, Marketting for Tech Support","I bought this printer specifically to print to Avery Window Decals since i had been informed it was compatible and the decals land within its specifications.What followed is hell. The printer likes to chew up the decals while attempting to push it out to the output bin.When i contacted epson i repeatedly got what felt like marketting rather than tech support. Things along the lines of ""special technology in epsons can only guarantee high quality on epson papers"" when i was simply asking why the printer was destroying my expensive media, not why it was printing ugly.The print quality when it does print is quite good i should add, making this not entirely negative.I will most probably be returning this shortly. If i get some miraculous support in the next day i will ammend this review."
5,Dependable product,"This is the second Epson printer I have owned and I am totally sold on Epson printers. My experience has been that they are very dependable. I purchased this one to replace a previous one that just eventually wore out. I am very pleased with this one. It does O.K. with ink usage, of course this depends on how much you print. I am planning on getting another one. I would recommend it."
1,Issues right out of the box,"I'm a visual effects guy in Hollywood. I use complicated computers and programs all day, and have done so for the last 20 years.I couldn't get this Epson printer to recognized it's own ink cartridges! I checked online and found that this was a common problem with this printer, and has been for along time. Based on the online comments, there is no way Epson doesn't know about this problem, yet they have no fix for it on their site.If you like being frustrated and wasting a couple of hours trying to make this piece of junk work, then having to spend time repacking it, and taking it to the P.O. to send it back, then by all means purchase it! Otherwise steer clear!"
1,fell apart AFTER 30 days!,"I don't really use my printer that much so when I started having problems I went online to return it only to find out that AFTER 30 days - you can't. Parts that were supposed to be fit together at the factory or wherever weren't. So after doing 4 repairs and the last one was beyond me, I tried to return it- no such luck. So I went directly to Epson and bought it from them, same model, same supplies but no problem. Buyer Beware!"
1,Into the trash can,"I literally trashed this printer, and I'll never buy another Epson product. When I replaced the original black ink cartridge (with an Epson cartridge), I got an error message advising me to ""Replace Cartridge"". I called Epson support and they said that they knew of the issue that the printer sometimes doesn't recognize a new cartridge, so they shipped me a replacement that did work. However, when this replacement went dry, and I bought another Epson cartridge, the printer wouldn't recognize that one either. Epson refused to replace the printer, but sent me another cartridge which failed to work. When it operated, I used the printer with my iMac, on which I run Parallels and a few Windows based programs. Although Excel spreadsheets printed as expected from the Windows side of my computer, some of the spreadsheets would print in a goofy manner from the Mac side. I junked the Epson Stylus C88+ printer and replaced it with an HP Deskjet 6988, which I love."
4,increased govt regulation,"The book is written for an American reader who might be a manager for an electric utility company, or for someone who might be involved in trading electricity. There is a slight defensive tone about the latter purpose, given the Enron fraud meltdown.There is an elementary discussion of the physics involved in power generation and transmission. To give the reader a basic understanding of what actually happens. Including the physical limits of a transmission line on the amount of current that it can bear. As well as the transmission losses incurred when selling energy over long distances.But much of the book deals at a higher level. Notably, explaining how to comply with government regulations, including the various regulatory bodies, where these might be at the Federal or state level. Not surprising, given the Enron scandal, which is still unfolding, and the heightened government scrutiny over the entire utility industry."
3,Pretty Good!,"This album is the debut for Cledus. You can't strike him for the ""sound quality"" of the album. The parodies are funny and so are the originals. I mention the ""sound quality"" because you can tell a difference between this album and albums that he put out later.If you have a Cledus record, I recommend you buy this record. If this would be your first Cledus record, I would offer a different album by Cledus, this guy has talent and the record label wimped out on his debut. Don't get me wrong you can make out the songs, it just sounds like it wasn't recorded in a studio at all. That is the only reason this album doesn't get 4 or 5 stars."
4,"Would make a damn good movie, someday","King of the Jews is a compelling, interesting fascinating read that tells the story of Lodz, the last ghetto to be liquidated in Poland. I.C. Trumpelmann is the protagonist. Supposedly a doctor, he cons his people, leaves, and returns to rule them and ""protect"" them from the nazis. He is loved and hated. There are funny parts, but most are horrifying and sad. One of the more interesting things about ""King.."" is that it gives you a look at not only what life was like inside the ghetto, but also the Jewish politics behind it.The down side is that there are so many characters it's difficult to remember who is who. I knew that this was based on a real man, but it took me a while to realize that Epstein had changed almost every major character's name, including Hitler's.Either which way, this is a fascinating book, that if fell into the right hands, would make a movie that could rival Schindler's List. Highly recommended."
3,Personal Business,This book was another recommendation to a sales company. It was helpful and had some good insights. It is to help in small businesses.
5,A handy guide to home-based business,"More Build It Big: 101 Insider Secrets from Top Direct Selling Experts is a handy guide to home-based business, written by professionals in The Direct Selling Women's Alliance especially for those interested in a home-based businesses that rely heavily upon network marketing, party-plan, and person-to-person sales.

From using a newsletter to enhance one's visibility to taking advantage of tax incentives to improving one's skill at friendly conversation, More Build It Big is a highly recommended supplemental resource and self-teaching tool for the dedicated entrepreneur. Also highly recommended is the previous book in the series, ""Build It Big""."
1,Cheap,This is really junk. Light stiff and cheap. The sleeves are lined with some plastic stuff. You will not be satisfied. The one they shipped us must have been returned because it had a candy wrapper in the pocket. We reinserted the wrapper and will return it also.
4,The Russian Style Fashion hip,"This ferza al hagat, an Arab cotton coat, is wonderful for those living in extreme temperatures. The inside consists of durma wool extracts with pockets of mutton lined with a synthetic alagnia (a form of cordex). This is highly breathable and makes a fashion statement in any part of the world except Alaska."
4,Well made but not good fit for a teen,"My son is tall 5'8"" and a little thick but a medium on him looked like he was playing ""dress-up"". The sleeves were way too long, enough so that we determined a small probably wouldn't yield an appropriate fit. It is bulky so if you are a ""big"" man width-wise, this is for you. Return was handled well. I got an Eddie Bauer medium and it fit like a glove. It is well made though & would keep you warm."
5,Got this for my flu larder.,"I already have the masks and needed the filters. Good price, better than that of the mfgr. where I originally purchased the masks. This mask and filters are highly recommended and that is why I purchased them in the first place."
3,Not what I expected....,"It was a little disappointing when it arrived. I had long desired a machine such as this that could intimidate the meddling neighbors and strike fear in the hearts of yuppy soccer moms but when it arrived it was much smaller and far less intimidating that I had expected. I loaded the twins in to take them to school and realized that there was not enough room for five. Needless to say Im now out of the carpool. What the Badonkadonk needs is a roof rack.My attempts to intimidate were futile. When I arrive at the twins soccer game, the mothers just point and stare at the ""Big Iron."" They've even gone as far as bringing bags of wrinkled clothes to press during the half-time.Overall, the Badonkadonk was a bad investment but what can you expect for 20 grand."
2,Not an amphibious assault vehicle!,"You should know that this is _not_ a hovercraft type of amphibious assault vehicle! It is not floating on a cushion of air (unless you count the air in it's tires!) And it doesn't float!! (well, it doesn't float very long..)They really should have been more clear on this point and included larger more visible warnings against driving it into deep water of a pier or boat launch... or at the least they should have recommend personnal floatation devices..with everybody packed in there it was like a remake of ""the Hunley""..STAY ON DRY LAND WITH THIS VEHICLE!!"
1,Buy American!,"I've been shopping for a light armored vehicle as a second weapon system for my wife. The 60hp Tecumseh engine seemed just right for the driving she does, primarily between our gated community and the Sam's Club in the bad neighborhood.But I decided not to buy when I learned that the Badonkadonk is produced in Ontario using Korean subassemblies incorporating Indian components machined by Filippino laborers! An American is free to buy any weapon system he wants, but if our upperclass stores, fortified housing, exclusive resort compounds, brokerage offices, and other common destinations have all been built by other Americans, shouldn't our transportation be also?It costs more and is a bit bigger than I need, but I finally went with a Cadillac-Gage LAV-300. Made in Michigan."
1,A horrible mistake!,"I can not recommend this automobile.Apparently they built the transmission backwards on my particular tank. My two lovely children were watching from the front when I put the tank in reverse, but instead of going backwards it shot forward and ran them both over, killing them instantly.I'm heartbroken, I'm now $20,000 in credit card debt, and my wife is trying to say it was somehow my fault for buying it in the first place. I do NOT recommend this tank.The only good thing about it is that it gets better gas mileage than my Hummer."
1,Don't believe the HYPE!!,"As an aspiring dictator of some little country in Eastern Europe, we bought three of these so called ""Tanks"" for our Paramilitary uprising. We opted to have the Camouflage paint job and now we can't find them anywhere! I want a refund."
4,International Shipping not available...,"Argentinean legislation can be tricky when it comes to importing tanks, submarines and, for some reason, toothpicks; so I asked NAO Design to put ""dish washer"" in the invoice's description. They hooked me up (trimmed a bit off the price too so I pay less import taxes) and when they were about to write down my address, turns out they do no ship Internationally, due to some treaty or other that the US signed with some multinational organization, UN or something, i don't remember.Needless to say, I am disappointed, NAO should get it's own legislator and two or three lobbyists in congress and create an exception for the JL421.Until then, I guess I have to continue using my Ford Falcon, which is as close as one can get to a tank, if you ask any Argentinean."
1,Don't drive it in Berkeley...,"I traded in my Hummer for the ""Donk"" because of it's myriad safety features and boy did I need them. In this new Obama liberal, tree-hugging environment this vehicle seems to cause road rage-- no doubt because of it's ""carbon footprint"". When I stopped at a light, liberals went so far as to get out of their cars and start shooting at me and throwing rocks. They were a crazed screaming Nazi mob. Thankfully, the rust-patina steel shell was able to repel the onslaught and I was able to hightail it back to my garage unscathed. I'm thinking of upgrading it with a M198 Howitzer to defend myself.The nerve of these ""enviro-weenies""! A man can't even drive to work anymore.Note: It doesn't come with cupholders, and the suspension is a little stiff."
1,Shoddy workmanship,My 'Donk was great at first but then the margarita machine broke. That SAME night the toilet clogged up!!!!! I bought it in December of 2005 and now the ba$tards refuse to honor the one year warranty!!!!!!! Amazon should do something about this!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!
4,Great for deer hunting!,I take this vehicle into the woods with my sister's wife and just start shooting at anything that moves. We haven't caught a deer yet...we usually run out of ammo within 15 minutes...but don't underestimate the taste of teriyaki crowjerky.
3,Excellent vehicle for desert sortees,"Rumor has it that George Lucas is now selling a 'Green' retrofit for this model that includes sails. Production was delayed when the prototype blew up.Also, the deck mounted cannon upgrade poses some problems as the turret can be de-elevated too far, allowing possible damage from friendly fire."
5,Only 14.99 for Shipping and Handling,What an incredible deal! How many people can say they own a tank that looks just like Jabba the Hut's palace? You'll have a return customer; the next tank I buy is going to be genuine NAO design.High quality tank; great value; incredibly stylish. You've got to own one!Five stars.
3,Not bad but...,If you have the Amazon 3.00 shipping thing IT DOES NOT COVER THIS!The tank is well built and the 6hp engine is more than adequate in helping you out run lesser 5hp tanks.
1,What a disappointment!,"Darn my own stupidity -- I had falsely assumed that this JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank would be perfect for commuting to work. What a shock when I realized that it would not fit through the gates of the Royal Governor's Palace of Colonial Williamsburg. That was just my first disappointment. But when I found it cheaper at my local Wal-Mart (thereby saving on shipping), my mind was made up. It had to go back.If it comes out in a more compact model, and they are willing to negotiate price, I will reconsider this purchase."
1,Very disappointing...,"I bought this based on the window sticker which stated that it got 2 miles per gallon.But in reality, in actual desert use, it only gets 1 mile per gallon.Therefore I do not recommend this particular tank."
1,SCAM! Beware.,"I ordered the Badonkadonk for some storm chasing. I like to follow tornados around and show the footage on my iPhone to hot chicks at the bar while wearing myThe Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee.Anyhow, I was severly dissapointed in the ""Donk"". The JL421 Bakonkadonk is just A LAWNMOWER WITH CARDBOARD GLUED TO IT!! Do NOT be fooled by the hype. The cardboard was torn away after the first twister.Do not buy!"
5,A must have!!!!,"I got to say, if im either sunning myself in the vast desert with a chick in a metal bikini chained unwillingly to me or navigating the zombie ridden streets at night during the Apocalypse, the JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank is the best money I have ever spent."
5,best tank on the consumer market,"Bottom line: when it comes to stomping out the Jawa menace in your neighborhood, this is the only way to go."
2,I bought one used...,"..from Jabba the Hutt. Let me say that it is impossible to clean all the slime out, it smelled like a bantha inside, and I found a used condom; I will never do business with him again. Plus, he plastered and painted over all the blaster holes. If you are going to purchase a used JL421, please be sure to go over the chassis with a magnet so that you know the body is solid. I guess you might say that my low rating is due to the fact that I got a bum deal on mine--just sour grapes. As far as I can tell, the JL421 is a solid ride in all. I am applying for a spot on MTVs ""Pimp My Tank,"" and hopefully they can fix up this hunk of junk; hydraulics, neon lights, DVD and game console...oh yeah."
1,Deathmatch on Tatooine,My mate Luke used to boast that he could bullseye womp rats in his clapped out T16. I told him he wouldn't even be able to bullseye my Badonkadonk. Turns out I was wrong...
1,easily blown to kingdom come,"I am an acquisitions officer for an artillery unit in the Russian Army. Since mafia hooligans stole all of our equipment to sell to Kyrgyzstani rebels, we have been looking for a low-cost alternative to the T-80 Main Battle Tank. After successful trials at a facility in Moscow, this so-called ""Badonkadonk"" was approved for use in the Chechen theatre. Initial reports were favorable, but then somebody noticed that the tank lacked a cannon, treads, and armor, and possessed the engine of an electric bicycle. It did, however, have an excellent audio system, but this failed to compensate for its disappointing 100% mortality rate. Recommended only for use against Lithuanians."
5,Well worth the money!,"Our last two JL421s have been total lemons. Since I'm a blonde and also use a cell phone when driving, my husband said, ""Hey! Safety at last!""He was right! I have mowed down five Hondas, four Toyotas, two Neons (what a piece of [...] THAT is) and yesterday I bagged an SUV. And me? NOT A SCRATCH, baby.I felt parking would be an issue but frankly, people go running when I pull up in my Badonkadonk. I took up seven parking places at the Mall and didn't even get a ticket!Somebody is bound to gripe about this, so let me tell you: the sound system sucks. Instead of Grateful Dead and Eric Clapton, you get some radio news channel about aircraft and radar, I have no idea what it is.So grab your CD player and cell phone...Wanna take a RIDE?"
5,Perfect for conquering your neighbors,"Although the JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank offers just about the right firepower for conquering your neighbors and, perhaps, adjacent neighborhoods, those of greater hegemonic ambition should consider a higher-end product."
2,I've had better...,"This 'donk sucks! I hated the so called aerodynamic design of the window panes. they're slotted and angled so you can only see out in one direction which makes it difficult to navigate in any other terrain besides open desert. they way amazon shipped this guy was less than ideal. yeah, it's big but what do you expect? it's a 'donk!"
1,What...No Cupholder?,"I mean I've been using donk as my commuter tank, and shes really been great.But I never realized how important cup holders can be. I spilled coffee on myself the other day and gave myself a fairly minor burn. It itches a little, so Im thinking it actually might be a rash. I have to admit that I accidentally ran over a few neighborhood kids the other day. They were playing behind my donk while i was washing it off in the hot afternoon heat, I put her in reverse to get out of the sun and took out about 4 kids. Not really sure how many I took out cause they are kinda lodged underneath big donk. Not really sure what I should do about that either, but she still seems to run unobstructed. Maybe one day they will fall off.But other than the cup holders...Id vote 5 stars."
2,A handy vac would do a better job,"For those that are thinking of buying this to 'clean up their neighborhood'- don't buy this thing. I did and it was a mistake. I've had this for several years now and despite the many funny reviews, a handy vac would do a better job than this machine. It doesn't vacuum, it doesn't sweep the streets, it doesn't empty the garbages. In fact, the rust color actually adds to the trashy look of the neighborhood. Hence the lower rating.If you are looking to buy a vehicle to take with you on your trip to NYC then this might be appropriate. If you are looking to go tour a strange country, then this might be a fine vehicle, depending on the country. But otherwise, I'd give it a skip.It is an expensive vehicle that drives so slowly you won't want to use it for the quick run to the grocery store, it doesn't 'clean up the neighborhood' and it is tight and cramped inside."
4,Remember to go with the ABS option,This vehicle performs poorly without the optional ABS. But put the ABS on it and this baby screams! Especially useful when there's a foot of snow. You'll be the only one driving!You may also want to wait until fall for the Hybrid engine.
5,Best Tank for the money,"This tank is by far the best tank for your money. I can fit at 20, and the insides are pure steel. Need a bigger ride for the big game? Well this is the only way to go.Those other clowns that try and hog up the lot will have nothing on you.Did your friend forget his wallet in Tikrit and is begging you to go back to the bar where he left it? Not to worry. You'll be the king of the road on the baghdad highway in this rig!"
2,Don't buy it,"I recently purchased the JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank for some light inter-planetary conquest, and I must say I am disappointed. After only 300 lightyears of use it required an MOT and the mechanic informed me that I would have to completely replace the 3.5inch thick rear armour, 345653.654cal laser cannon and 18.5inch alloy rims (spinners, of course). Cost me one Zorgian Dollar and fifty cents!Dynamite sound system though"
4,"Great product, but be warned...","My friend and I each bought a Donk and used them to recreate the Battle of the Bulge, using Downtown Flagstaff as a stand-in for Luxembourg. He was the Allies and I was the Axis (we flipped a coin to see who played who, I didn't willingly volunteer to act as the German Army...). It was fun and all, but needless to say, local law enforcement wasn't amused with the amount of destruction we'd caused.If you're using Donks to simulate historic battles, I recommend a large open area. Less property damage and fatalities."
3,Not the chick magnet I hoped for,"So I thought the Badonkadonk would really pull some chicks for me. I mean, it has style and class and ports to fire missiles...what else could one ask for.But in reality I cruised the local high school and lo and behold there was my arch enemy in his 1999 M1A1/2 Abrams main battle tank. On shot and my bodonkadonk and all my posse were blown to smitherines. I'm back in my Yugo drivig solo.Get the suped up battle version - a couple heat seakers would help out."
2,Underwhelming,"After blasting my music too loud one too many times, my next door neighbors got fed up and bought a Badonkadonk to teach me and my stereo speakers a lesson or two. I was quaking in my boots when the tank arrived on their doorstep.They went after my shed first, which was made of straw. And they drove and they plowed and brought that to the ground. Then, my neighbors went after my garage, which was made of sticks. And they drove and they plowed and brought that to the ground, too. But when they tried to knock over my brick house, they rammed into the walls and broke their tank.I'm unimpressed. Too bad they didn't shell out the money for the optional gatling gun as others here have done.My music is louder than ever."
1,Just a toy,"Check the stats! The sound system is more powerful than the engine! No machine gun, and the windows are too big. Good for parties, lousy for fighting off post-apocalyptic barbarians. If you're serious about surviving the collapse of civilization, get yourself a basic armored vehicle and use the money you save to hire some mercenaries."
1,This tank is entirely unsatisfactory,"I have now purchased six of these and not one has worked long enough for me to adequately invade Poland.The furthest I got in one (the fourth purchased!) was half a mile down the B303, before it broke down outside the local Budgens.Disgusted is not the word.From now on I will seek to undermine their government from within.One star!"
1,Toy for the dumbest amongst us,This stupid looking tank must be the toy for the dimmest and dumbest amongst us. Likely lovers of this one could be Don Rumsfeld and George W Bush.
1,You'd have to be a moron,"It's a symptom of how depraved our culture has become that this item, like the Hummer, is even available. I guess there's an emerging sociopath market that manufacturers have finally found a way to tap into."
1,Seriously,I am Blackhawk Pilot in the US Army and I mean this is one of the dumbest things I have seen in my life. $20K for an electric tank. There must be some really bored people in this world. I don't see how anyone could find this remotely interesting. And for the (probably majority) of people making up these stories: get a life.
4,Low rider don't drive to fast,"Fitting after market hydraulic suspension and flourescent downlights under the rims turns this otherwise combact innefective light armour vehicle into a pimped out chick magnet, and makes it somewhat easier to get over otherwise impassable objects on the battlefield, as well as neighbourhood speed bumbs. Keep in mind that you may find that the flouros need to be turned off during actual combat. All up this makes for a great lifestyle vehicle, perfect for work and play. Until I bought the JL421 I just had no idea just how much the chicks digg multi purpose light armored attack vehicles."
4,It's not as perfect as all that!,"I went the extra bucks and bought the stealth model. I drove it home (and Hey! Don't believe the stories of 0 to 60 times reported by other owners. It's all bunk. My best time was 0 to 60 in 3 minutes, 14 seconds.) Anyway, I drove it home, parked it in the driveway AND NOW I CAN'T FIND IT!Sometimes stealth can be too much of a good thing. I should have gone for the standard model.Sam"
1,Drove like a Tank,"I was somewhat interested so I went for a test drive at my local Donk Dealer.First Impressions:There are like 0 options for this thing.No Hatchback VersionNo 4 door versionNo Spoiler (this would had been sweet)No lighted cosmetic mirrorNo 8 trackNo Bike RackNo Hitch (Come on now!)No Color choices. (Perhaps if they had Mary Kay pink)I took it for a test drive:Damn thing drove like a tank. We've been building vehicles for over 80 years. You would think some of that engineering would make its way back to NAO.I felt every bump.Serious understeerIt had a blind spot as big as an eclipse.You need a 4 lane highway to make a U turn.To top it off, the horn didn't work.I also checked the modification market on the internet. Again it was seriously lacking. There were no suspension upgrades, exhaust upgrades or chip mods. I found one site that had a missile upgrade. Real dissapointment."
1,Tank? Please. :(,"This is most certainly NOT a tank. I mounted a military surplus M68A1 105mm main gun for deer hunting. I only got one shot off. The resulting recoil ripped off the roof and flipped the ""tank"" 3 times. Needless to say, I will NOT be buying another JL421 in the future to replace the heaping scrap of metal in my backyard."
2,Disappointing,"I was undecided as to whether I should get a Toyota Prius or a JL421. I opted for the ""bad boy"", mainly on the strength of the reviews found here. I must say, I am a little disappointed. For starters, the performance. While I'm not expecting to hit 60 in under five seconds, I didn't think it would take three days, 4 hours and 26 seconds. Could do better. Secondly, the after-sales service leaves a lot to be desired. When the brakes gave out, they replaced them with a land anchor. I live on a hill, so I can see the safety aspect, but it's a little impractical round town especially since my model does not have power steering. Seriously - what were the designers thinking? I had to hit the gym for four weeks until I had built up sufficient strength for a three-point-turn. On the plus side - it's a looker and I enjoy taking it to my Save The Environment meetings on Thursdays."
3,Useless in the snow,"I bought this product last spring and it worked great for crushing my enemies, seeing them driven before me, and hearing the lamentation of their women. I was king of the world! Nothing could stop the nightmare thunder of my JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser Tank.Until it snowed. Then my Badonkadonk got stuck in my yard, unable to negotiate even a few inches of snow. Unbelievable that the manufacturers installed a blu ray system with 5.1 audio output in the dash but didn't think to include four wheel drive and snow chains?! Not all of us megalomaniacs live in the desert, ya know. The Donk is currently serving as a glorified igloo for my kids to play in until the snow thaws.I'm giving this product three stars because it DOES work great through spring, summer, and fall. Just don't make any plans to conquer Siberia or Antarctica or even northern Canada using this machine. Hopefully any newer models will take cold weather into consideration."
3,Formaldehyde sickness from living in my donk,"I have been living in my Badonkadonk for three months, after my wife kicked me out of the house for not lifting the toilet seat. Things were fine the first few months, but after the second month, I began developing a wheezing cough which the doctor says is being caused by the ""new construction materials"" in my Badonkadonk leeching formaldehyde.Now my hair is falling out, and my lungs are in distress! I suggest you leave the windows on your donk open to air it out ever few hours if you plan on living in it for extended periods, as I have!"
1,Not Recommended for Combat!,"I'm in the U.S. Marines stationed in Iraq and me an my platoon along with some govt. funds chipped in to get this tank. There are six members in my platoon and only five would fit in, I chipped in the least so I had to sit this one out when we go to battle. Soon as that Badonkadonk hit the field those Iraqies blew that sucker up like it was a Fisher Price toy on the 4th of July! So unreliable. I lost 5 of my men, and even worse I was out $1,000. At that moment I became a lone soldier with an empty bank account. We shoulda known better then to use an untested pile of junk before settin out to war. Now I'll never see that money again, or my platoon."
1,The JL421,"Many is the night, I am sitting in my bathroom, wishing I could drive my shed onto the highway as well! Well now with the Badonkawhateverthehellitis, I can finally fulfill my life's dream! Thank you!"
4,"Finally, a tank in pink!","I've been shopping everywhere for a nice little tank that really says ""Let's have a good time""! I feel secure knowing the other warlords, agrophobics and the tinfoil hat set don't have this tank.I feel i can show at the PTA meeting and no one else will have this tank! It gets so dreary buy weapons of war from the usall places.This will be my UPSTANDING AGROAUTO, maybe I'll take it to burning man next year!!! OOh... I'm all a twitter!I Gave 4 stars becouse it's little and trendy hot. But any deceant piece of gear will jack this golfcart in a prts store."
2,does NOT attract chicks,"I thought this tank would be a real chick magnet, but suffice to say that that has not proven to be the case.It's a fine tank and all, and serves its main purposes well, but I really thought it would help me get some action, so be forewarned... it will not. Though I am not much of a stud, so maybe it will work better for you, I dunno.I'm keeping it around just in case, though, ya know?"
3,My other Badonkadonk is a Canyonero,"I looked at Frank Lloyd Wright's ""Falling Water."" I checked out Corbusier's funny leather chairs. I even tooled around in a Mercedes 300SL gull wing. But none of those would do...none of them embodied the epitome of such fine design, such sleek and noble lines, nay, such grace and yet uber-indestructible brute force as the Badonkadonk. I mean, Falling Water had that nifty bomb shelter built in to the basement, it even came with a weenie roaster for post-apocalyptic campfire sing alongs, but nothing says both guts and glory with such a touch of je ne sais quois like my Badonkadonk.The only area in which I find it lacks is the extra added touch of personalization, for the eternally hard-to-please woman who will settle for nothing less than perfection. I mean, my Canyonero comes with a lipstick holder instead of a cigarette lighter. It's all in the options, man...all in the options."
2,"As an iron, it leaves a lot to be desired","Since I've become an extra-extra-extra large clothing size I've been on the lookout for an iron that:1) Covers a much larger surface area2) Doesn't adversely impact my eating timeImagine my joy when I came across this latest Badonkadonk model that appears to be a grotesque iron! I can lay my fat-clothes on the driveway while heading off to the nearest McDonalds drive-through. My clothes would end up crinkle-free while, at the same time, I'd be filling my drooping-lard-belly with hamburger-fat goodness!But alas, as an iron the Badonkadonk only managed to leave tire stains on my clothes. Plus the McDonalds takeout wouldn't fit through its tiny windows. I regret spending so much of my burger-budget on this lemon."
3,"Very luxurious, but with one glaring issue","Pros: Luxurious, much larger on the inside than it looksCons: Warranty does not cover Jedi attacksI have a friend that has used the Badonkadonk for years, for the sole purpose of attending to certain ""business"" out in the desert. He has been able to entertain many guests aboard this vehicle while attending to his business, and even found a robot to serve him drinks aboard it. However, his Badonkadonk was involved in a certain ""incident"" concerning a Jedi, and the vehicle is no longer in working condition. Upon attempting to contact the company to have it replaced under warranty, they company informed him that attacks by Jedi aren't covered. So now he's just stuck with a $20,000 pile of metal. Do not buy this if you think you may come under attack by a Jedi at any point in time!"
2,Not impressed,"Worked ok for the first few months I used it. I'm 5'10, 170lbs and it's fairly comfortable with the adjustable headrest.I began finding ball bearings scattered across the garage floor and realized it was from two of the casters that fell apart (explains why it always felt like one of the casters were dragging). For two new casters it's $20 (including shipping). That's nearly half of what I paid for this creeper shipped so I think I'm going to look into buying a higher quality creeper instead."
3,Shipment should not dmage a garage used creeper,""" Seller did OK, but did not list that product was made in China. Box had slight external shipping damage, when box was opened, product had broken caster and other damage. This product is for garage work and should withstand damage that may occur during shipping. I should have bought USA made product, buyiing on internet makes it difficult to find out product origins."""
5,impressive,"cynical pop...i pictured a singer with a sly smirk on his face pretending to be arrogant. pretending, because there is an honesty to the songs on this ep that, when mixed with the whitty lyrics, creates a refreshing new pop sound. this might be what fountains of wayne would sound like if they were served by one too many bad waitresses."
5,"Terrific, a most enjoyable listen.",I was recently introduced to Paxton's CD. I have found it to be a refreshing and revelating addition to my CD collection.
2,last R&R tour,"parker is always great but the backup band sucks, lame guitar and the drumers mindless pounding rim shots are enough to drive you up the wall these figgs flop..."
2,Another JFK Book,"I felt this book re-hashed everything that has happened with the Kennedy family over the last 40 years. I felt sorry for Caroline because of all the tragedies and heartbreak that she has gone through though. One thing that made me dislike the book was the fact that at the opening of the ""Jacqueline Kennedy: The Camelot Years"" reception, she snubbed off Laura Bush (The First Lady) and didn't even speak to her, but put Hillary Clinton on the pedestal and praised her. That seemed pretty rude since through the whole book everyone talked about how down-to-earth and friendly Caroline was. Overall, the book was just a repeat of everything we pretty much know about the Kennedy's."
2,Another Jack and Jackie Bio,"The first 2/3 of this book is nothing more than another re-hashing of the story of Jack and Jackie. Only it's told as the story of ""Caroline's dad"" and ""Caroline's mother,"" references that the author uses ad nauseum. Perhaps that is how he justifies the title and the claim that this is a book about Caroline. It is only the latter part of the book that truly deals with the subject at hand, Caroline Kennedy.Sure, it's difficult to tell Caroline's story without referring to her parents. However, we all know the story of Camelot. And is it really necessary to refer to the same old quotes from the same old sources? Somehow, I thought that this book might be different. It's not.This is a easy read (in a People magazine sort of way), as I completed it in less than a weekend. But save your money... wait for the paperback, or better yet, get it from your local library. It isn't worth the full cost of the hardback."
2,"Not only ""same old, same old""... but inaccurate","I have read all of the Kennedy biographies and there is very little new information in this biography. The first part has been covered in all of the others, and the second part has been covered in the tabloids, which makes we question the accuracy of anything here that has not been lifted from another source. I noted two parts of this book that do not appear to be in keeping with what has been well documented. 1. The books states, that on April 4, 1968, Caroline was in her classroom when a teacher came in and whispered to her teacher that Martin Luther King had been shot. Quick research on the Web states this happened at about 4:30PM EST..Are 11 year olds in class at that time? 2. The books states that when visiting the White House JFK Jr. told then President Nixon, that he used to play under his desk. Everyone knows that the famous Kennedy desk was removed when he died, and not used again until it was brought back by President Clinton."
4,Balalaika,"As usual there is an unlikely plot, but the singing and songs make up for it all and you can get lost in the magic of Nelson Eddy's voice. It ends happily and that's what these musicals were all about - romance and happy endings."
3,Taste and Make of Milo,"The product is China made. Taste is not quite the same as those I had shipped before, from Australia, New Zealand, UK, Malaysia and Singapore. Color is a shade or two off the original Nestle Milo.It is not widely available or rather not available in the District or the vicinity supermarket where I stay. I like the rich chocolate flavour especially in wintry seasons and I drink it with a slice of Brea California bread and strawberry jam purchased from Potomac Cosco. Instead of adding evaporated milk, I stir in condensed milk typical style (no sugar)to get a rich flavourful taste drinking it while hot."
5,Good stuff,My boyfriend loves Milo chocolate mix. He discovered it overseas and was surprised I was able to get some for him. Fast delivery.
5,the real deal.,My daughter fell in love with this in Chile and we were unable to find it in the local grocery store. She loves it more than regular hot chocolate.
2,Underwater photography book,Very disappointing. I was hoping for a more informative book. This was pretty basic photography. The previous reviews were misleading for me. This was a waste of money.
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I have a bit of experience, but not much with underwater photography... I was looking for something to take me to the next level. This book seemed like more of the same, and didn't provide me with much. I would say that it is also a bit outdated..."
1,don't bother,"try another hitch number as this hitch is just close.only one hole alined,the other two had to be drilled.the receiver is way under the bumper. DOSE NOT FIT A CHEVY S10 AS STATED.USE TO BE A GOOD COMPANY.must be a Obama thing.."
4,useful,"I bought this as part of a gift and was disappointed with my first set. They where tarnished! :(The seller quickly sent me a new one and the recipient, a frequent crab and lobster eater says they are great for getting all the stuck in bits. they look very cute and sturdy."
4,Game is fun,The game was purchased for my 10 year old nephew. He enjoys it and I have tired my hand at it a few times and its quite fun.
4,Insightful dog story,A serious heartbreaking book about the relationship between a special dog and an owner who needs unconditional love. Some reviewers have criticized the multiple points of view (not always chronological). I found listening to the audiobook added a special dimension since each voice was created by a different narrator. The dog's voices were especially delightful.
3,A Book For Dog Lovers,"With the current glut of mystery/thriller fiction available, it is nice to see an auther explore thoughts, feelings, love and relationships, particularly those between human and animal.The two Wolfhounds and the cat in this story are elegantly portrayed and very enjoyable. The humans for the most part are less believable and not as likeable.I'd recommend this story for those who have lost a cherished four-legged family member, or those who fear losing the same."
2,DISJOINTED and annoying,"oh my goodness...this book is beyond schizophrenic. i ordered it based on a review in Bookmarks magazine and the reviews on amazon.com. don't be fooled: the dogs only speak rarely and then it's only for 2-4 pages (for a total of only about 20 pgs...). otherwise, the narrator's voice skips around from men to women without any method to the madness. new characters are introduced on a whim; old characters are given a voice after being mentioned only once 100 pages earlier. this book is incredibly frustrating and not worth the time."
4,Worthwhile and touching,"Sight Hound does not clank along with all the plot machinery of a ""big"" novel. It moves very quietly.You know, from the beginning that the dog is a goner, that Rae will bond with someone in her life and possibly lose someone else. The writing is beautiful and the story is touching and the book is worth reading...especially the funny chapter ""written"" by the cat."
5,Sight Hound,"Hearing Pam Houston as the keynote speaker at the Loft Literary Center's Novel Writing Conference deepened my appreciation for her novel Sight Hound and how novelists can play around with structure. I'm savoring this novel, re-reading sections before I go on, and enjoying it immensely! I can hardly wait for her new novel, Contents May Have Shifted, to appear."
4,Fascinating view through a dog's eyes (and other senses...),"This unusual novel is skillfully choreographed in multiple voices, among them two Irish Wolfhounds, a cat, a vet, and humans close to the animals. Novelists are often cautioned to avoid using multiple points of view, because of the disorientation it can cause, and I admit I did find myself unable to remember a character's identity once in a while (I read it over about five nights' time) but the overall effect is one of buoyancy, of a somehow familiar mingling of beings buoyed up by the life-force itself. It is a delightful novel, and I intend to make sure my dog-loving friends know about it, especially my friends who have Irish Wolfhounds."
5,SIGHT HOUND - could be 'Insight' into hound...,"SIGHT HOUND is magnificent contemporary writing. It is also one of the greatest DOG books ever. As someone 'owned' by an Irish Wolfhound, it is an extra pleasure to read. Pam Houston has an extraordinary ability to speak in many voices with both truth and wit. And for anyone who is dealing with mourning a beloved canine soulmate, this is a MUST READ."
4,I really wanted to give this 5 stars,"This book pulled my heart strings. I too lost my ""soul mate"" dog to bone cancer and it was eerie how many links there were to my real life. Hearing Dante talk was theraputic, I would dearly love to know what my dogs think. Rose describing her favourite treat couldn't have been put better! The emotional ups and downs between the humans and dogs are the best I've read and help put this book in my top 10.I also loved Pam Houston's chapter in Dog is my Co-Pilot.But the first chapter is tough (power through everyone it is worth it!) and the human characters are not real, they seem ""Hollywood"" (ie created for a television movie and manipulated)."
4,Wonderful book,"While the book can be confusing with all of the different points of view, hang in there and you will be rewarded. Great story, great things to consider after you read it...and I'm not even a ""dog person""."
3,A little sentimental for my taste,"I love books about women and their dogs, I admit it. I bought this one because Amazon recommended it to me based on a lot of other books I've bought. But it disappointed me. The woman is such a 'hero'--like, everyone loves her so much and she seems so perfect, when really I found her annoying. And her husband is perfect. And the dog is even more than perfect. I love my dog more than I love anyone in the world, but even I know that he isn't a saint. I just felt uncomfortable the whole way through, like I wasn't reading something true. On the other hand, I have to confess, I never wanted to stop reading it. I guess this is what's meant by a ""page turner."" That's why I gave it 3 stars, a compromise."
5,Monster Gourment Dining,"This is a great Huggly title, and like all the others in the series, it's a huge hit with our 3-and-a-half year old. Perfect for bedtime or for read-on-your-own, the fun pictures, the great cast of characters and the riotous story lines win all around. Huggly, Boote and Grubble are the least scary monters under the earth, and their mischief and adventures are all very good-natured."
1,Misleading condition,"It said this book was in good condition. When it came I was dissappointed to see that it was quite beat up. Bent corners, rubbed away edges on cover and folds in pages."
2,"""Blood on the Tracks?!!!"" I think not!","First - I have every Parker CD. And mean all the ones from when they first came out (not just those listed on this site.) I love Graham - seen him live three times (whenever he comes through.) BUT - this album is awful. The original reviewer was really on the money (even if he was a man of few words.) This album is wishy-washy, sappy, no urgency at all. Hey - I loved Struck by Lightning which was largely acoustic - but that has some killer songs. This album has nothing going for it. Not one song sticks in the mind.I dig it out periodically to give it another listen, but honestly - this thing is horrid."
1,Not what you call tops!,"This CD is pretty bad in my opinion. I put it into my CD player once. I haven't put it back in since. Anyone want it? I'll give it to you for FREE, because I sure don't want it!"
2,Weak GP album,"I love Graham Parker and love most of his albums, but this one is an exception. It just simply isn't very good. Partner For Life is a eloquent song about marital bliss without being too sappy, and it is the one highlight of the album.He has a couple excellent acoustic albums, mainly Struck By Lightning and Live! Alone In America which are both excellent albums."
4,Graham Parker - Intelligent Music Beyond The Norm,"Look, I've got to stick up for Graham and this album. First and foremost if you don't like intelligent song writing AND well crafted pop, you aren't going to like Graham Parker. Fine by me (and him) because Parker suffers no fools. This particular album is probably his most mature outing yet, one filled with beautiful songs that actually do something most songs don't these days: impress you with the authors life and experience. From the extremely haunting opening tune ""Partners for Life"", one of my favorite love/marriage songs to the bitter observations of ""Disney's America"" you will not find a better 'full immersion' listening experience than this. I must warn however that this is Parker at his mellowest, far beyond anything he did with the Rumour. Personally, I love this album!"
4,GP Quality,"In the grand scheme of Graham Parker's career, I wouldn't call this a weak album nor an unusual one. It may not have the dynamic highlights of a ""Squeezing Out Sparks"" or rank up with some of his recent overlooked gems, but it's still a pretty solid album with some very memorable tunes, all with Parker's trademark lyrical bite. Anything this guy puts out is interesting to my ears and this album is no exception."
3,Where he's at,"TWELVE HAUNTED EPISODES could have been titled GRAHAM PARKER TODAY, as the songs reflect where the artist is at. It is perhaps as laid back as any Parker album I know. ""Fly,"" ""See Yourself,"" ""First Day of Spring"" and ""Partner For Life"" play in my head when the CD isn't playing on my stereo. In recent years Graham Parker concerts consist of Graham and a guitar, and no band. That could be one reason for the stripped-down TWELVE HAUNTED EPISODES production values - there will be no missing wall of sound when performing these songs live. By the way, is TWELVE HAUNTED EPISODES the first Graham Parker album to include a picture of Parker without his sunglasses?"
5,This is an excellent album by a very talented young lady.,"Crystal clear vocals, the kind not heard since the days of Karen Carpenter. Melodic and thought provoking lyrics make this a must for any collector of contemporary folk music. Even better still, she is Scottish."
2,NOT a seat cover as title indicates,"This product is just a little back pillow, not a seat cover. The pillow is nice and comfy, but I'm rating it bad because the title lies."
2,Only for the very petite!,"Extremely short!!!! Came up to my waist (I'm 5'7"", size 10) Ugh! And of course you can't return once you've opened the package! Beware! Total waste of money if you are average to tall! Very disappointed.Very nice design, okay fabric (better fabric than some others but not high quality either)Fabric similar to low end pantyhose that covers but does not hold, mold or shape you in any way. Not much stretch.Would be fine if you are slim, trim and around 5'."
4,A good book,"This book is based on a robot which anyone can build if they have a little electronic knowledge. BUT, the book only describes a robot which just walks around the floor. THAT'S IT!! There's no voice recognition, it's just like a remote controlled car, but it can go around on its own without a controller. I am now searching for a book which reveals how you build a GOOD, WORKING robot, not just an electronic car like this book!"
5,A Must Read!,FANTASTIC. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a unique perspective on relationships.
4,Rebirth of the Psychedelic Furs,Love the song. Reminds me of the Psychedelic Furs in 82' (RIP New Wave). Buy it.
3,"Good, but needed more detail",This was a good introductory book but did not go into enough detail for my taste.I did like the anecdotes and the pictures were great.
3,Not Fully Satisfying,The way the author chose to wrap up the story isn't satisfying and feels like a let down from the grand beginnings. Still a nice read if you need to know what happens to the couple.
2,Not the best of the three books,"The first two books in the trilogy (Sooner or Later, Waiting Games) are the best ones. In this book, Jessie comes across as an angry, much less sweet and innocent version of who she was before. She is definitely less endearing in ""Now or Never"". And Michael is so caught up in his recovery that he becomes self-pitying, boring and irritating. There is also quite a bit of foul language in the book, so some parents may not find it suitable for their teens to read it."
4,Not as Updated as You Think,"As a college student, I found this book extremely informative. But even marketing professionals may get something out of this book. The content is very focused and clear, albeit a bit out-of date. The scenarios presented in this book, however, simply illustrate the concepts of the authors and their dates are not that important. The only 'updates' to this edition seem to be some simple case studies of succesful and unsuccesful marketing plans implemented by different types of companies, so I would recommend the original edition in paperback to save a few bucks. Overall, however, I am very glad I read Marketing Warfare and will definitely hold on to it and refer to it in the future."
5,Marketing is Warfare,"I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone seeking employment in a competitive environment. As a marketing major, this book was informative but did not teach me anything new about marketing. Instead, ""Marketing Warfare"" did look at marketing at an angle I had never thought about before. Marketing is war. Anytime one company makes more money another company loses money. That is the way a free-market economy works. Now that I have read this book I feel more educated in the field of strategy and tactics. This will help me in the long-run as I am looking to one day become a manager who will have to make decisions about strategies and implement the tactics that will need to be used to win the marketing battles of tomorrow."
3,"good information, simplistic style, and a bit wordy",I am an engineering student and I read this for a business class on entrepreneurship.The information is sound and straight-forward. The authors labor each point repeating it many times which got to be a bit annoying. The war analogy is a bit overdone--a marketing VP thinking himself to be a general is a bit pretentious--though it makes the book memorable. The many case studies flesh out the principles he lays out and it's easy to apply the ideas with contemporary examples.The book could have been 30-40 pages instead of 220 using more concise language and normal size font. I'd recommend borrowing this book from a library or even reading it in a book store since it's a quick read and you'll absorb most of the information with one reading.
1,Ups.. Al Ries did positioning,"I think ""Positioning"" is the best ever book written on marketing by Al Ries. But this book is just a positioning they build on that book. I recommend reading ""Art of War"" by Sun Tzu instead of this book, and apply in marketing and everyday life. So simple."
4,Good comparison of war and marketing ...,"The authors first talk about some important wars and the strategies that were used that made and broke the war (which are derived from Karl von Clausewitz's ""On War"" book that was published in the year 1832). The same war strategies are compared in the marketing field too - defensive, offensive, flanking and guerilla warfare. Four case studies - Cola war (Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi), Beer war (Budweiser vs. others), Burger War (McDonalds vs. Burger King) and Computer war (IBM vs. rest of the world), are dealt in explaining those strategies. Though last couple of chapters (about advertising, tactics and strategies) was not that interesting as the rest of the book, overall this book is a good one.Also recommended: The 25 most common sales mistakes by Stephen Schiffman, The little red book of selling Jeff Gitomer, Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore."
1,worst $10 I ever spent..,"Sorry, but $10 is not worth this book. I bought a CD and what i got is 2 guys talking for 45 minutes. They talk how they decided to pick military approach instead of conventional marketing approach. They don`t provide any solid leads what to do, but general view why military is similar to marketing. OK but what should I do next? should I start reading military books?I listen to them and I came out with knowledge that absolutely doesn`t help me.What a waste of my time and money."
5,The best book for marketing guys,I have read all the books of Al Ries & Jack Trout and this must qualifyamong his best.It's a must see for all the marketing guys irrespective of the industry he operates on.
3,Needs to be updated,"Although, the basic information in this book is valuable, the specific examples and case studies need to be updated to include current market positions, strategies and success/failures. However, we can all learn from what other companies have done in the past."
3,Dated,The content and information are from the 80's. A follow up book would be great to compare the current marketing trends and see what the current leaders in software and computers did to knock off the companies that were on top as of the writing of this book. They kept quoting a Russian military General Clausowitz. I think Clausowitz read Sun Tzu's Art of War. Maybe they should have quoted Sun Tzu.
2,"Fork to tiny, knife is useless, spoon is great","The fork on this set is just plain useless. It's way too tiny & skinny. The knife is just about as useless, but good news, the spoon is great. So if your looking for just a spoon, this set is for you. If not, look else where. I recommend spending more money and get the Brunton My-TI Flatware."
1,Bad Purchase,Doesn't work on a 2005 Tacoma as the unit is sealed. Was a poor purchase. Site misled me to believe it was for the vehicle mentioned.
3,Was not the correct part for my vehicle...,"For some reason, this drier service kit didn't fit my 2005 4runner. It's the correct Denso part number and everything, but the metal plug was way too small. Even the drier dessicant (sp?) pack was shorter than stock. I would have given it one star, but the parts themselves are well made. Just not sure why it didn't fit."
1,Inaccurate unit,"I have bought 4 of these from Amazon. I have calibrated all four for temperature accuracy and they all consistently read the same within acceptable limits. However, with one of the units I cannot adjust the relative humidity. I cannot correct the humidity reading with the adjustment. The dew point reading depends upon the accuracy of the relative humidity and so the dew point is in error. I need a good dew point reading to prevent mold in some air handling equipment so this unit forces me to guess on its error and estimate the dew point. Not a good feeling. Some people might think three out of four is not bad but I don't see why I have to put up with the time and trouble caused by poorly manufactured and tested products! One star, less if I could!"
5,EXTECH HUMIDITY METER,For the price you cant go wrong. Nice large display. Easy to use. I'm going to buy a couple more.
3,seems fair,"not a whole lot to say about it - dew point is a nice feature... however, i trust other reviewers to be correct that the Western Humidor ""Calibrator III"" is way more accurate. I bought both, and the Caliber seems a lot more responsive, and is probably indeed more accurate."
2,Needs alot of work,"This book, though a valiant effort, is not what a potential AutoCAD VBA programmer needs. Jerry uses non-standard coding styles and most of the examples in the book do not work. It's simpilitic coverage is not what a newcomer to VBA programming needs, but rather real short examples of code that works. A potential buyer of this book would be well advised to look instead at ""AutoCAD 2000 VBA Programmers Reference"" from Wrox Press, Ltd."
4,Only skilled programmers need to apply,"This book was not intended for the average cad user in my opinion. It seem like it was design to help the experience AutoCAD users who has had some hours in either Lisp and/or any other programming language. It helped me get started on the basic things like creating entities and modifying them. You will NOT learn VBA for AutoCAD in a book that's under 200 pages long, but this one will sure get you started in the right direction. Thanks Jerry."
3,Best Book on VBA in AutoCAD?,"The rating of ""Best Book on VBA in AutoCAD"" is defaulted to this book because it is the only on on VBA with AutoCAD. I can't say I didn't learn anything with this book. But, I can say that I didn't learn very much. If you don't know anything about using VBA at all don't expect to learn it from this book. One positive thing is that Jerry Winters give a few examples of using VBA with AutoCAD. However, it looks like he wrote the book while learning to use VBA with AutoCAD. It is a step above what you get from Autodesk."
2,lots of loop holes,"I have reviewed this book in its entirety. I found it to be pretty simplistic, and i would not consider it a book from which to learn much about programming in VBA. I found about a dozen errors in this book which i contacted the author about in emails, with no response. Having used autocad for 16 years, I would like to see more in depth coverage. overall, i found the book average, with some sloppy mistakes"
3,a mildly entertaining comedy,"The best thing about this movie was Jimmy Stewart's acting and Brigitte Bardot's five minute or so cameo appearance. It is a rarity that you get a chance to see Bardot speak in English, i.e., without the dubbing.Stewart plays the role of a poet and a somewhat unhapply professor at a large California University. His son played by Billy Mumy, the ubiquitous child actor of the 60's, is discovered to have extraordinary mathemetical skills. He also has an extraordinary crush on Bardot. What ensues is an implausable sequence of events; Mumy displaying more mathematical wizardry than a powerful mainframe computer, Mumy picking the winner of horse races and Mumy (with Stewart) taking a trip to France to meet with the inimitable Bardot.Overall, this was not a great comedy but it was at least well acted and mildly entertaining."
3,Lovely quality but Plates are too small...,"I really like the mugs, saucepan and saucepot. The quality is very nice. Just know that the plates are 6.25 inches in diameter which is really not large enough. I'll use them as saucers and supplement the kit with separate dishes."
2,Too expensive,What's going on with Amazon? Coleman sells this for only $19.99 and Amazon's price is $26.xx ??
1,HUGE honkin' ugly glasses,"We bought some white wine glasses a while back and the Metrokane Rabbits were truly beautiful. We use them 10:1 over our Reidels. After my wife broke ANOTHER Reidel burgundy glass, I ordered these. They are HUUUUGE. I'm very serious when I say that an entire bottle of wine would easily fit into one of these glasses (with room to spare!) There is nothing attractive about THESE monsters and storage is a big issue (literally.) They would make a fine fish bowl!"
2,glasses feel cheap and look cheap,Save your money. These feel horrible in the hand and look even cheaper than they are. So disappointed!
1,Did not recieve number of items promised.,I hate to give a bad review but...I ordered these glasses for my grandmother. When she received them there were only two. I emailed the buyer to let them know of the mix up and never heard back.
5,Awesome. Too bad amazon overprices imports,"This CD is absolutely awesome, one of my favourites for several years now.It's a pity Amazon.com overcharges us on imported CDs, this should be $13 and not $24. No wonder people prefer file sharing to being ripped off."
3,Solutions Manual!,"For anyone looking for extra problems to work in preparation for the PE exam, take note: this book does *not* provide practice problems. It is a solutions manual for Lindeburg's Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual (look at the larger view of the cover and note the blurb in the upper left corner). It was previously published as the ""Solutions Manual for the Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual"" -- which I bought last summer along with the reference manual in hopes of taking the test last fall.I'd rate the book 4 stars if I weren't annoyed at buying it in hopes of having more exam-grade problems to work. The practice problems in the reference manual aren't (IMHO) as good practice as the problems in a book like ""101 Solved Mechanical Engineering Problems."" The solutions are useful, but the title is inaccurate."
3,"Ok Movie, but.","Why is the Music from these movies never available? It would make watching them worthwhile. Not very interesting. You've heard it all before,"
4,love chronicles; secrets revealed,"I loved this movie Terrence Howard always gives a stella performance, love chronicles; secrets revealed was just as exciting as the first movie, it ended in a different way than I had anticipated but I loved the ending especially with vivica fox and her husband, I love happy endings and this one was great."
3,"Mixed live bag, mostly for fans.","That said, I should add that I am a fan, so this disc has a permanent home in my collection. But for the casual listener, you should probably start with the first album or the ""This Is Easy"" collection. The main reason is the sound recording quality which ranges from pretty good (""Fantastic Planet of Love"") to horrific (""Twine Time"" and any of the cassette lifts). But for the die hards, this disc saves for posterity what a dynamic live performer Crenshaw, at his peak, can be. It doesn't hurt that the lineups included the original trio (Marshall, brother Robert on drums and bassist Chris Donato) and members of Joe Jackson's band (Graham Maby on bass). Makes me wish for a King Biscuit Hour or Warner's Radio Special to be hidden in the vaults somewhere waiting to get discovered."
5,Good product,I've been using this for about a year. It's a good product. I've found it works best if you give two applications before painting. Put on a good first coat then wait until it's almost dry and coat again. I have a few body panels I did this to and even with out a top coat they are still good.
4,It works well,"This Rust Treatment works quickly and easily, the only thing is I'm not sure I used the right paint to seal it. So just make sure you purchase the correct Sealing paint recommended on this product."
3,"Good, but unoriginal.","As someone else already mentioned, the book is mostly a bibliography to other books. Skip this book and head straight to the definitive source for software engineering, Steve McConnell's ""Code Complete""."
4,"Good book, excellent idea...","This is a very good book for revising, or better to keep you with everything fresh in memory. Most of the tips are those that when you read you say ""I know that"" or ""That's obvious"" but the point is exactly that, to remind you of the 201 obvious things that you should be doing on daily basis at work but your not."
3,"Real jewelry, real tiny","I was looking for a themed gift for the flowergirl in my garden wedding. I got the bridesmaids peridot jewelry, so this necklace seemed a natural choice. It's a great bargain for 14kt and semi-precious, but you get what you pay for. It's exremely small and the heart is thin and appears very easily breakable. The join between the heart and its hanger also looks pretty weak. I am going to advise her parents to take extra care with the handling of this piece.The peridot, however, looks perfect- nice and bright and a decent size."
2,"Small, small, small","I ordered this for my niece's birthday. The chain is delicate, and the heart with the stone is so, so small. The heart laid across your finger is barely visible. It appears much larger in the picture."
3,tiny but cute,this pendant is extremely small. it's smaller than small. but it does look very pretty on my 10 yr old daughter.
3,coming out via conversations,"This is clearly an introductory volume to a series since it seems most concerned with setting up the characters. Considering the protagonist is a painter, it is also a curiously non-visual book. Fast paced, with extensive verbal exchanges, the most obvious issue is ""coming out"" -- via the younger sister who gets to ask all the questions re: sexuality, homophobia, desire and relationships. The artist of the title, having brought together the other three characters, seems intent on trying out casual sex and eating things like pizza, formerly on her list of forbiddens. It will be interesting to see how the characters settle and where the story is going."
5,Excelente narrativa adolescente urbana,"No creo en la conexion falsa de Andres Caicedo con movimientos de izquierda ni politicos de ningun tinte.Este libro evoca nostalgias de una Cali que se esta desvaneciendo y que no se ha podido rescatar, a traves de los ojos aun inocentes y al mismo tiempo crueles de los personajes adolescentes de sus novelas e historias. Es existencialismo sin densidades filosoficas.Totalmente recomendado."
4,hair product,i use this product and ordered it and recieved it. i would order it again thanx it works fine. thanx
5,Love It!,"I love this product, works great with short hair and a must for girls. Not too sticky or gross in your hair but you really need to shampoo it out to get it all out. Love It"
3,Try at salon or barber before purchase...,"I tried this product at my local Great Clips and it seemed to have a different consistency from the product I received at home. Overall it serves it's purpose, just wish it was the same as the one I tried before."
2,Disappointed,"The chimp is absolutely adorable - but it ends there. It fails to do anything it is suppose to. It doesn't make any motion or noise unless you are constantly patting its back. There isn't any facial movements. If you want to feed the chimp, you literally have to jam the bottle into its mouth and even then you are lucky to hear a sucking noise. My daughter fell in love with this monkey on Christmas morning, but was disappointed when it didn't really function. It broke my heart, but I returned it to the store today. It's not worth the $35 and I'd rather she have something that actually does what it's suppose to."
5,I Want This Item!!!!,Please notify me by e-mail when this item becomes available. Thank you very much.
5,Can't go wrong,"This is a book my husband has had for years...he lost it a while ago so I bought him a replacement. It's not only great for beginning guitarists but also nice to have on hand for ""old pros"" who like to bone up on basics periodically."
3,usable but not what I expected,"I already had a water bottle for my rats but had to use an old one because the water bottle I bought was for a wire cage and I have a glass aquarium. The holder I bought was the right size for the bottle but the bottle wouldn't fit! The hole that the metal tube on the water bottle is supposed to go through was too close to the base. I ended up flipping the metal holding piece to the side and just resting the cap of the water bottle on it. It still holds it and it works just fine, but it doesn't hold the water bottle the way that it is meant to."
1,drip dry hangers,drip dry hangers it sucked. I order the multi- colored hangers they sent me the all white thin hangers. and have not returned my money after i sent the hangers back. This has been over two weeks ago.I would say donot buy anything from them.
3,As expected,"This product does exactly what it's asked to do. It's a vitamin, what possibly could I say to endorse this product?"
1,Disapointed,"Although Clarence Larkin books are very good, this particular one is just a compilation of other peoples information. I was extremely dissapointed with the small amount of information in it. The book was way over priced. Had I paid considerably less for it I wouldn't be as disapointed. I paid as much for it as I paid for the book of Revelation by Clarence Larkin. I am very happy with that book and several of his others, and highly recomend the other books. My suggestion is, save your money and put it towards one of the other dispensation books and then study about the baptist online or take other avenues but dont buy this book it will be a definite waist of your money."
1,from a classical dispensationalist view,Do not buy this book if you are looking for perspectives on the historic Baptist faith.
3,A Useful Listing But Not Truly Informative,"The author has compiled a useful listing of monasteries and the like that welcome guests, but the descriptions are little better than those one finds in an AAA travel guide. There is, for instance, little information on the extent to which one is expected, or allowed, to join in the spiritual life of the institution or (excepting listings of numbers of single and double rooms) whether married couples are welcome. Moreover, he seems to have strained to include one guest house from each of the 50 states, rather than the best guest houses, wherever located. This book simply provides minimal leads that must be followed up."
1,It has potential,"this book has a lot of potential. As a college student, I must say that this book really stinks. The in-text examples do not represent what is needed to do the homework. Also, there is no way to check answers to the homework problems as there are no solutions in the back and a solutions manual is not available. The lack of solutions makes this book very difficult to use."
2,Not a good book,I had to get this book because my school required it but if I had the choice I would look for a better book. This book has no answers in the back and a select few on the book resources. The example problems are not very helpful and the book is confusing in almost every way.
4,A good book.,"I bought this book for an EE survey class (I am an aerospace engineer, but was required to take this class). It does a good job at teaching the basics of circuits, like Kirchoff's laws, Thevenin circuits, and transient response. The appendix even has a section on complex arithmetic, which is particularly helpful when dealing with inductors and capacitors. With plenty of practice problems and clear examples, this book does a good job and conveying the basics of electrical engineering. I won't speak to the depth of the material, as I took it for a survey class, but what it does cover, it covers well."
3,Good for a survey only,"This book is a superficial survey of circuits. Although the writing and organization is decent, if you enjoy diving to the core of the subject look elsewhere. To me, this book takes the fun out of otherwise very interesting fields of study.For a deeper and more lasting understanding, I suggest e.g. Nilsson/Riedel and Sedra/Smith for electric and electronic circuits, respectively (both highly recommended)."
2,Defective copy,"The book received was the correct book, however it was a misprinted copy. The book I received had pages 31 through 78 printed twice and was missing all pages before 31. I ordered the book before my class started so did not notice the pages were missing in time to return the book."
5,Electrical Engineering Principles & Applications,This book will get you through all the electrical engineering concepts you have to learn but don't want to. Downside: There are no answers to any of the problems.
4,Got the job done,"This book had excellent information. Some concepts could use elaboration, but it was one of the better textbooks I've delved into."
3,BOOK LACKS ANSWERS,"The course this book is used for is very difficult, and there should be at least every odd answer in the book. You try to study and you don't know if your getting the right answer because the answers are not listed in the back of the book."
1,Utter Waste of Time,"Want to learn electrical engineering? Sit in a chair and do absolutely nothing for 10 hours. You won't learn anything, but you will learn more than what this book has to offer."
2,Truly aweful,"I am required to use this text for an introductory EE course for non-EE majors at my university. The text is at times nearly cryptic (especially FETs), does not give enough examples, and unfortunately most of the problems in the book do not have answers (some are online.) And, in general, I feel unprepared academically to answer the end-of-chapter problems after reading the chapter and doing the (very few) examples. I have done online searches on some of the subjects in this book and come across free webpages with FAR better explanations. If you learn by doing problems, don't waste your money here."
4,Good undergrad lesson book,Good book. This book is more of the basics book. Great for remembering the undergrad lessons. Remember circuit analysis and Laplace transforms?
2,Not an excellent book for a student,"I had a class that required this book, and to be honest, this book is not all that well structured and written. The only real use for this book is the formulas and explaining several of the most basic concepts of electrical engineering (how to calculate resistance, basics of electromagnetism, you know, the bare basics). It is very poor on giving examples and explanations on how the concepts apply in real life situations and to the problems they give at the end of each chapters. And even the monotonous ""solve this circuit problems"" are not explained in the text very well. For about 70% of the problems I couldn't figure out the problems at the end of the chapters without consulting a solutions manual or the instructor. I don't recommend this text to teachers unless you'd prefer to go over the samples and concepts in much more detail than what the text covers. And even then, it will most likely give students who are introduced into electrical engineering a hard time."
2,The cover says it all...,"The book is on eletrical engineering and the cover is something to do with American football. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is absolutely no link between the two!The best part of this book is its cover.Get my drift?"
1,Deception How Satan Deceives Us,Don't waste your money! The book was shallow with information-Regret buying it-many other books out there better than this one as far as sprituality!
2,PLUNK,"ONE OF THE SIX STRINGS BROKE WHEN I WAS INSTALLING THE SET SO IT RENDERED THE WHOLE SET USELESS. OTHER THAN THAT I GUESS THEY WERE OK IF YOU LIKE TO PLAY JUST 5 STRINGS.UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS THE STRING I USE TO PLAY THE ""ONE NOTE SAMBA""...!I WILL NOT ORDER MARKLEY STRINGS AGAIN."
5,Great toy...very durable,"bought a few of these for our English Bulldogs, and found this exact toy is the only one that stands up for any lenght of time.The dogs love chewing on the tire part and the rope part..it's the perfect size for them to play tug of war with.It doesn't last forever (but not much does with Bulldogs) but it sure lasted long enough (I gone through 3 in 4 years with daily chewing).Definelty worth it!"
1,Made my pup sick!,"Everything with this toy was fine until my lab chewed little pieces off of it. A few hours after that she became very ill and threw up 3 times! I started doing some research and saw that this is happening all over, so my advice is DON'T BUY IT!"
1,This book sucks,"Another in an unending series of books bashing men, putting them into cute little categories such as ""Mr. Cheapo"" and ""The Older Man"". Too bad the author cannot even write, and that the publisher did not see fit to have it properly edited. For instance, the author writes 'throws of passion"" when this is actually 'throes of passion"". How are we supposed to take this book seriously? It's just a piece of garbage.Also, the book is full of nonsense. She clearly has no idea what to say about men, so she simply bashes them. Her book is filled with such profound 'insights' as ""men are stupid"".I'm sick of this kind of women. She's uneducated and tries to come off as if she knows something. She doesn't. This book is trash."
1,"don't be duped, the capacity shown in the picture is incorrect","the picture shown for the item is plainly 1100mah. the item that gets shipped is 730mah. apparently they've been duping customers for at least 3 years now, based on other comments here on this site.don't buy this battery if you're looking for higher capacity - the picture you see is simply false advertising, not an example of what you will receive."
3,Only good price,"The batteries do not last long and after being recharged, they only last a few minutes. The price is good."
5,Very interesting look at the outbreak of SARS,"This is a very interesting look at the outbreak of SARS, told in a journalistic narrative voice by the editor of Asia's Time Magazine. It takes you through the eyes of many of the doctors and victims involved, and gives a strong sense of the feel of the time, the various cover ups, and how the discoveries unfolded. A quick and interesting read."
5,The End?,"if eschatology's your bag(the study of 'last things', i.e. ""Exit Mundi""(just Google that!)), then try Laurie Garret's ""The Coming Plague"".it could knock your socks off."
3,Re-runs doom Nameless Detective fans to Deja vu,"Pronzini sits at the top of the list of Hammett's successors. His Nameless Detective has established his own claim to the San Francisco neighborhoods where Sam Spade and the Continental Op once trod. As a long-time Nameless fan I sought out Scenarios, hoping to revel in a trove of undiscovered Nameless tales. Alas, this collection of mostly re-published materials overwhelmed me with deja vu. These are great stories--Pronzini doesn't write any other kind-- but if you're a Nameless fan, you've probably read most of them already in such collections as Case File and Spadework. Plot lines from several others can be found in full length Nameless novels. Only two or three of these fourteen stories sounded new to me. New fans will enjoy this book but oldtimers will be better off waiting for the next Nameless novel."
2,Try another book !,"I am relatively new to the commercial real estate industry, having purchased my first commercial lot just a few years ago. I was looking to increase my knowledge and learn from others mistakes so I wouldn't have to find out what works and what doesn't the hard way. Overall the book had some good concepts, nothing great. The book looks as if the author just used a generic image from Microsoft Word and printed it out at home. I've prepared better-looking papers in college. If you are interested in the real estate industry try looking somewhere else. I think friends of the author must have written the other reviews."
1,Making Money in Commercial Real Estate,I give this one star only because Amazon does not provide an option for a lower rating. It was a TOTAL waste of money for me. Nothing but a bunch of feel-good anecdotes about how this guy made a lot of money years ago. I wanted something to tell me how to close a deal to buy a shopping center and to manage that property after that. This was one of the get-rich-quick lectures of no help whatsoever.
4,"Impressive, easy, and successful ideas that work","My goal is to be conversant with commercial real estate purchases and sales. The book outlines those formulas that makes it all clear and easy to follow when it comes to 'how to do it.' As far as I'm concerned, it turned a complex field into something I can understand and relate to as a novice. I never thought working in the commercial area of real estate could be made simple, but these methods clearly set forth all the elements needed to do it. It appears the results should be very gratifying indeed. Anyone who invests or intends to invest in real estate should read and re-read how it's done by another successful investor willing to share his knowledge."
4,Clarke's Best Novel,"Although Childhood's End seems to get more attention, The City and the Stars is Arthur C. Clarke's best novel. It ia an evocative, awe inspiring look at a society in the far distant future. It evokes a real sense of wonder in a way that very few other books do.The Sands of Mars, while not on the same level as The City and the Stars, is also a good read."
4,The City and the Stars,"A book I read during my teenage years, read again as an aging adult. I did love this story, as I believed that it represented Arthur C. Clarke at his imaginative best. However, although I did enjoy the new reading, I now find the story and style a bit dated and probably meant for younger SF readers of a previous generation. Basically, it seems that one can never go home and recapture the past. However, all in all, it is still an enjoyable read.The City and the Stars and the Sands of Mars"
5,Nek Rocks !!,I tried out the CD yesterday at a book store and I was hooked by this CD (I bought it off course!). The songs are awksome!! They have both energy and emotion. 'Fatti Amare' is my favorite!!
4,as usual good,the usual patter and snappy writing.....Lassiter at his best and I love how human the character is...a little conceited and sure of himself but screws up.......a lot of my Lassiter reviews bleed over into each other
2,did not like,I could not get into this book. I am 50+ female and after couple chapters put it down and have not picked back up.
2,So-so,"It isn't that I didn't like it. It was okay. It was predictable and not very well written. The dialog was stilted and the plot was predictable. I think the author has talent and potential, but I hope his best work remains to be read. It was a nice little time filler, but it isn't great fiction."
4,Good read,I got this book when it was free on the Kindle. Enjoyed the characters and the story. Looking forward to more in the series.
4,Enjoyed it!,"My first time reading this author and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The witty, tongue-in-cheek approach had me laughing out loud several times. Truth be told, some of the humor is conry but hey... Plot-wise, it's pretty run of the mill-pretty girl playing both sides gets caught with a few twists and turns here and there. All in all...enjoyable..Would recommend."
4,Loved the turns,"this book had a lot of twist and turns in it, which I loved a lot. Just when you thought you had it fiqured out it took another turn."
3,"Not bad, not very good either","The main character, Jake, is pretty likable: a goofy ex-football player, a decent guy, and pretty good attorney. Jake was a bit too dopey for me. Some of his decisions were just too simple-minded for a trained attorney.It's not a bad story, but too much time is given to Jake's thoughts--I skimmed some pages that weren't at all necessary to the story. Worst of all, the most important piece of the story's climax was totally ignored and forgotten until the last few pages. That would never have happened to anyone involved in a legal battle of his life.It was an okay book, but I won't be reading any more of the Jake Lassiter series."
3,Intriguing but very predictable,"I enjoyed this book and found the characters to be very interesting, although the story-line was very predictable. I could tell what would happen far in advance at all times throughout the book, and was never surprised. This was easily the most predictable book I have ever read. The characters should have seen very many obvious things throughout the book, and it made me feel as if most of the characters were mentally handicapped. I also noticed many inconsistencies and typos, but they didn't necessarily detract from the story-line. I will consider reading another Paul Levine book before giving up on him completely, but as it stands, I was hardly impressed."
2,Unappealing Protagonist,"This book had some very intriguing characters and the overall story idea was good. However, I could not warm up to the title character, Jake. I get it, he's a bachelor, a former athelete turned lawyer, etc, but that doesn't mean he has to be a moron.I'm not a prude or a teetotaler, but I find the idea that this guy thinks it's okay to give beer to an eleven year old at risk child as well as exposing him to horribly dangerous and emotionally scarring situations to be idiotic in the extreme. Whether or not he was raised by some moonshine swilling swamp hag, he should have some degree of common sense.Overall, it was simply an irritating read."
3,Book had potential,"The premise of this book was catchy however there were too many different stories taking place during the read. While you can follow the story, I was disappointed about the shallow story line. I plan to read another by this author before investing in more books from this author."
1,Just didn't interest me.,"I read about 20% of this book and just couldn't finish it. Nothing about it held my interest. It was my first time reading this author, and I probably will not try another of his books. Many others liked this book so it must be good for some people."
3,Held my interest!,It was a good read. The plot moved quickly and held my attention. I enjoyed it as a distraction after long work days.
4,surprisingly good book,"I am new to Paul Levine, having only read one other of his books. I found that one to be readable, but not great. I was very pleasently surprised at this effort, and enjoyed it as much as any Robert B. Parker, Clive Cussler, or any other well known major author. True, you will have figured out 'whodunnit' far earlier than Jake Lassiter, but you will enjoy how he saves himself. I will be reading more Paul Levine. Thanks!"
2,Old or stored incorrectly?,"I've ordered these in the past, I think they are a good product. This batch, however, was unlike any I've had in the past. The pills were all covered in chalky residue, almost as if they had started to break down or maybe were exposed to heat or other elements. I'm not sure if the condition effect the results, but I couldn't help but think I was using a damaged product. Disappointed."
3,it was predictable,"It was a good book, but it was predictable. I knew that in the end Mary's friends would eventually find out the truth, and they would still be friends, even before I finshed reaing it. It's one of those books that the stories are like the stories of pther books or TV shows. I read a lot of books and watch a lot of TV, and I always those things always happened in the end in the TV shows and books, when I read this book, the story was the same."
4,Teaching A Culture,A friend of mine is Samoan and teaches Samoan dancing and culture to Samoan children. She researched and found this book ideal for her purposes.
5,Perfect product at an excellent price,I ordered this from the damaged goods section of Amazon. It was the only item of this type in the category. Shipping was quick and the product was as advertised. I am quite pleased.
1,Never received,"Ordered this item, we never received it.Don't buy it because it may not get to you. Only gave it a star because they wouldn't let me give it a zero."
5,Straight talk about Straight talk,"Joyce Meyer is a favorite author, but this book is for everyone. She gives biblical answers for all the tough questions, and it's so helpful and practical! Get it!"
5,get it together,"Joyce is the best in giving you the direction to move your life forward. If you feel stuck or down or just feel like you are going crazy, like it is just you. Read this book. It changes lives every day. Both me and my wife give it to people all the time as part of our ministry to reach out and help.Manny NowakSuccess Coach[...]"
5,Everyone Needs To Read This Book!,"This is one of Joyce's Best books! In her no nonsense way Joyce addresses some of the most pressing issues we all face with God directed advice which she makes easy to understand. I've read a lot of her books, but this is by Far my favorite! Easily can be read again & again with new benefits & insights each time."
5,Great Purchase!,I purchased 3 of these books for my colleagues. Each of them were in exceptional condition. Although I purchased each of them from different people. One person was kind enough to include a bookmark that matched the book. This was worth the investment.
1,Till Eulenspiegal's horrible Christmas pranks,"This is by far the worst book I have read and don't reccomend to anyone to read this book. If you do your stupid. Please if you are going to get a funny book get something that is not so vulgar and immature, plus not even my teenage boy thought anything in here was funny"
5,Helmut Lotti ~ Always Amazing,"Helmut Lotti never disappoints me. He is such a wonderful singer and entertainer. This CD was no different. When it comes to voices ~ let me listen to Helmut Lotti, ANY TIME."
1,the worst book I ever read,"make no mistake-this book is about the author with some lame music reviews thrown in. it goes like this.... led zepplin ripped and screamed through their first set crowd went wild..meanwhile back at the beach me and my friends were..with a claimed 30+ years ""research"" on the band I expected a whole lot more, I am going to rip off the cool cover photo and throw this book straight in the trash right now."
1,Whole Lotta Lists(of songs played at Led Zeppelin concerts),"Simply put, this book would get an ""F"" if it were a high school term paper. On the other hand, it should give anyone wishing to get a book published hope. If this piece of thin drivel can attract a publisher, anything can!The book consists mainly of a series of lists of material performed at Led Zeppelin concerts. The concert, um, reviews...no...rememberences are are attributed to the authors, friends of the authors, cousins of friends of the authors, sisters of cousins of friends of the authors, and nearly any friend/cousin/sister of anyone who ever took an Instamatic camera to a Led Zeppelin concert.There IS a bibliography at the back of this book, but i've come to believe that it just might be copied from an ACTUAL Led Zeppelin biography. It certainly doesn't appear to reference any material used in this project.Oh well...I bought this book, and now I have a whole lotta toilet paper with black ink on it."
3,A Zoso that is So-So,"As a die hard Zep fan for the past 22 years, I am always thrilled when a new product comes on the market about Led Zep. Sometimes the thrill gets chilled when the product doesn't quite meet your expectations. This book is one of those moments!! It is nothing more than a bland autobiography of the author's life during the Zep era!! There are NO significant insights into the band given that haven't been exposed before in better works. With all that said, there are a couple bright moments which prevented me from giving ony one or two stars. However, if you are a new Zep fan and are starting to collect a library of material, DON'T start with this book!!!!"
4,Standing part of the workout is fun,"I did this workout through the standing portion. I HATE floorwork and stopped a few minutes into it. The fact that Mindy got me on the floor at all means that I was into the workout. The standing portion of the workout is a lot of fun. It's cardio oriented with strength benefits, the type of workout I am enjoying doing at this point in my exercise life. There is a modifier who gives options for the higher impact moves, which is nice. Mindy is always so enthusiasatic and many of her workouts I don't do because she's so enthusiastic that they are advanced. As an intermediate exerciser, I enjoyed the energy level needed to do this workout. It's more intermediate and she offers the options I needed to get a good workout for me."
1,Complete Rehash of manual,"This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is a rehash of the manual and nothing more. There is nothing in here you can't get out of the help in Freehand. This book is 'obviously' committee written, with Deke adding a little ""twinkle in your eye' for good measure......soley for the purpose of exploiting the people who desire to develop thier skills in FH8. This book will not help you. There is no technique whatsoever covered in this book. Just a plodding, time-consuming once over of the physical (virtual?) tools within Freehand, sans context."
1,the macromedia user's manual was better,"If you need reference help, try FH8 for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickStart Guide which is easier to use and has better detail and presentation, and is half the cost. This book does have nice cover design, though."
5,the best cd ever!!,Vertigogo is the best group ive met the guys and their really sweet and talented plus very attractive when you get this cd you can't go wrong!!!
3,Waterproof - yes; comfortable - not really,"I've been wearing these for over a year on and off. These have tougher leather in my opinion meaning they are so not comfortable to walk in. It could also be a harder sole that makes it seem like it's less comfortable. They squeak so all your office mates know when you are walking by. That said, these handle the snow and rain well. It seems like the horse-shoe heel does a commendable job when walking on sidewalks with fresh snow or for those shop owners and residents who refuse to shovel. Seems rain proof and pretty warm compared to my ""normal"" dress shoes that are not waterproof. These are my default work shoes in the rain and snow. I have to agree with the other user, they don't look too good when broken in. I believe the fault is due to the tougher leather."
3,Yumeria: Complete Collection,Yumeria: Complete Collection While it wasn't exactly what I thought it was it was still good. The art work is very good and the story arc is not bad. I would have appreciated better development of the story however. I have the feeling that they tried to include every thing in to short a space and it would have benifited from more or longer episodes. Overall I would recomend it as an evenings pleasant entertainment.
2,The bird house looks really nice in the picture...,"...but not so nice in person. I ordered 3 of these and only one of them resembled the picture (the house part was kind of crooked but useable). On the other two, the roofs don't fit square on top of the house so that when you hang them, the 'door' is not straight ahead. One was so bad that the door was facing nearly straight downward; impossible for a bird to sit in. Perhaps this type of item is best purchased in person so that you can inspect the quality."
3,Freshman Release Doesn't Hold Candle to Follow-up,"Unjust's Freshman release is good--but after hearing Come Feel Me and Nylon from the second album you realize how much better their sophmore album is. Their third ""release"" titled Demo2K2 is even more polished--a bit softer though--but excellent. Get this album if you want a good explosive album, but the songs sound just a little too much alike for me to give it a higher rating. Still a good listen though."
1,horror horrible!!!!!!!!,it was not good at alll!!!!!!!! never this movie if you want scary it was allllllfullllll!!!!! alll the movie in this case was stupid!!!!!
5,Save Earth with seventh generation laundry detergent!,"This is a wonderful detergent. It is biodegradable, so you don't have to worry about polluting when you use it. It is gentle, with a subtle, natural smell. I soak severely stained clothes before washing them with seventh generation detergent because it doesn't have the harsh chemicals that take out stains...but soaking works. It even gets out the poopy stains from my son's cloth diapers! I highly recommend this product."
4,Great for kids with sensitive skin,"I use this with the 7th Gen. unscented fabric softener and there is virtually no scent left in the clothes, and best of all, my kids, who have very sensitive skin and suffer from occasional eczema breakouts, do not have adverse reactions to these products."
5,Fantastic detergent!,My husband has psoriasis and needs a free clear detergent. I won't buy from companies that test on animals so I thought I'd give 7th generation free clear laundry detergent a try. I love it! It works great and smells like clean clothes should smell- not some nasty fake scent. I'm a loyal 7th generation costumer. You can print coupons on their website and I buy it at Target. It's very reasonably priced. Give this detergent a try!I also love their dryer sheets!
5,Cleans Well,I really enjoy this product. Makes my clothes clean and fresh smelling without the use of petro products.
4,Love this. Revived my lifeless hair after coloring. Used with Shampoo in set,Love this. Revived my lifeless hair after coloring. However I found that a lot of hair came off during the wash.Used with paired Condtioner in set. Recommend - esp after color treatment.Have not yet used the 3rd item which is the Iron Finish TechniArt.
5,Best Conditioner Ever!!!,"Tried many conditioners for colored hair, and L'Oreal's Expert is by far the best for my hair! Amazon delivered it quickly, too! Very happy with this product."
2,"watery, cheap feeling.","This product was not worth the money. I still have half a bottle of the shampoo left. As far as color fade goes, my stylist asked me why my gold looked so brassy this time around. I tried a sample of the Intense Repair masque. I will try that with the matching shampoo next time."
2,Understanding? Nope....,"I'm afraid I must be a dolt; for, after reading this book with some attention and care, I find that none of its lessons has sunk in. I don't understand what the author was trying to say; I didn't come away from the book with any insights or comprehension that I hadn't gone into it with. The book is the origin of the famous phrase, ""The medium is the message,"" and, while the author attempts to justify it at numerous points in the text, I never really feel that he has managed to make it clear.The book does not seem to follow the typical construction of a book of explanation: begin simply, build up to greater complexity, justifying each step, and end with a conclusion that follows from what has gone before. Instead, this book seems to wander about, making points as they may occur, but lacking a formal explanatory structure."
1,don't waste your money,This is a waste of money. Really useless information for someone who has any experience in dating at all. I wish I could get my money back.
1,Love & Diamonds In 90 Day Is Not A Great Value,"Love & Diamonds in 90 Days is a useful guide for someone who is new to the dating game, but doesn't offer much for anyone with more experience. The advice is not very detailed. It glosses over just about everything--how to create personal ads, handling dates, etc. There is not much meat to this book for the high price. There are 95 pages with lots of white space--wide margins and big blanks on the pages with exercises. If it was laid out like a regular book, you'd end up with a pamphlet. I was expecting more."
3,Good - but not really good,"I like parts of this book, but overall I rate it as one of the lower books in the series. Still with its good points its a descent read, worthy of being checked out at the library. And since its outta print thats probably what you'll have to do. But if you're a faithful reader of this series then I would definitly read this. I read the whole series in a week so its not going to take up to much of your time, but let me know what you think. Reccommended to the faithful."
3,Entertaining PI thriller,"I am reading the Elvis Cole books slightly out of order and each time I am reminded how good the series is.Cole is a good hearted Private Eye supported by his lethal partner Joe Pike. The joy of these books is the blend of story, character and terrific one liners.In this one Cole decides to hunt down a missing father, unaware that forgery, the Russian Mafia, the Feds and even Vietnamese gun men are also heavily involved.Perhaps the story is slightly weaker then usual with some slightly clichéd Mafia characters, but the other stronger characters and the dialogue do compensate. Fast moving if slightly short book (I read it in one sitting) this is a fun and entertaining read.If you have not yet caught up with this series, you have a treat in store."
4,Fun and Easy Read,"Elvis and his partner, Joe, were asked by three children to find their missing father. Their father was a printer, the eldest said. However, Elvis and Joe soon discovered that that was not the whole truth and the situation went far deeper than finding a missing father who was a printer. The Russian mafia and US Federals joined in the chase. With a pinch of the Elvis-Lucy and her ex-husband triangular romantic mess added to it, this is another Elvis Cole novel worth reading.Elvis Cole novels are one of the greatest discoveries I¡ve made during the year. To me, it is a typical fun book to read, having a nice and courageous guy as the hero, always easy and entertaining to read."
4,A Cut Above the Rest!,"This was probably my least favorite Elvis Cole novel by Crais. That said, his average novel is better than most. Elvis is drawn into a mystery when three kids show up at his office asking for assistance in finding their missing Father. As Elvis investigates, he finds himself into a mystery involving Russian mobsters, Vietnamese revolutionaries and the Witness Protection Progam.Elvis enlists Joe Pike of course and we delve deeper into Elvis' relationship with Lucy Chenier. Keep 'em coming Robert."
4,Robert Crais has another Elvis Cole winner.,"Easy to read and most enjoyable. Robert Crais has created a most interesting PI with many wonderful quirks and a great sense of right and wrong. Love the wisecracks and asides that are a big part of the Elvis Cole persona.Colorful characters populate this one: a conterfeiter in the witness protection program, the Russian Mafia, Vietnamese revolutionaries, the Feds (some with dubious qualities) as Elvis and Pike attempt to reunite the counterfeiter with his three children.No problem to follow, good pacing, a good surprise at the end, a satisfying conclusion and just plain hard to put down.This is an extraordinary series with a certain noir quality that would translate well to film, especially if played like the ""Thin Man"" series."
4,a good read,"It was my first experience of Elvis Cole. The story is fast moving and credible, the characters believable. I'm looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with Elvis."
2,A real disappointment -- save your money,"I've enjoyed the Elvis Cole series but this was indeed a sub-subpar effort. Even for what is expected to be a ""light read,"" there was nothing remotely credible about the plot or the characters. Improbable, unlikely -- the willing suspension of disbelief can only be stretched so thin.The bit about the mysterious klling machine partner (Pike) who always shows up at the right time is also getting tedious and makes Harvey the six-foot rabbit seemed grounded in reality. Let's face it -- characters like Pike and Hawk (in the Spenser series) are as pathetic fantasies as anything found in some bodice-ripping romance novel.Buy Michael Connelly's latest (or any book of his) rather than this book. For real writing, emotion and character development there is just no comparison."
5,Inndigo Slam,I love all Elvis Cole novels and Robert Crais writes really terrific books. We are waiting for the next Elvis Cole novel as we just adore his novels.
2,Unpublished First Work?,"Amaturish,simplistic very unsatisfying eample of his earlier work. I fear Pike would mot be pleased with his role in this piece of trash!"
5,Another Great Read!,"I started the Elvis Cole series about 2 months ago and am reading them in chronological order. Each book gets better than the one before. I hate to finish one, but can't wait for the next!"
3,OK,"I have read almost of of Robert Crais books. Indigo Slam was one his early books and not as good a read as his later books. When I see a Robert Crais book coming out,I order it as soon as it is released. His stories are both interesting and funny."
2,Ipad Buyer Beware!,"Ok, so my husband, Shya and I love Robert Crais and this book rates 5 stars. However we have recently taken to listening to them on our iPad...And you CAN'T. In a bid to protect these discs from pirating, Brilliance Audio has labeled them as being small tracks with holiday music titles such as ""Deck the Halls"", a couple of the disks are by the artist Jayne K. or are not titled or labled with any artist. This makes a jumbled mess in your iTunes playlist. We are enjoying the disks in our car as we travel to and from work in NYC. If you are getting these for your CD player - Buy! If you are getting them for your iPod, iPad or mp3 player - Don't"
3,Average Crais,"In terms of Crais's Elvis Cole novels, this is about as middle of the road as it gets. While not a superb novel, there is really nothing wrong with it. Sometimes drags a bit, sometimes exciting, it's a good book nonetheless.Basically, a young girl enters Elvis's office and asks him to find her father. What happens is a typical hairy situation with a lot of twists and turns. Though it is quite unrealistic at the end, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to continue reading about Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike."
5,Robert Crais is simply THE BEST!!,"As a huge Robert Crais fan, I of course have to say that INDIGO SLAM is a great novel! Elvis Cole has always been my favorite private eye, and this time he and Joe Pike take on the Russian Mafia along with Federal Marshalls to find the father of a young girl and her two younger siblings. Like the other novels in this great series, there's plenty of action and suspence that will keep your attention up to the very last page. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book today. I gaurantee you will not be disappointed!"
2,Mediocre effort,"I've really enjoyed Crais' Elvis Cole series -- especially LA Requiem -- but Indigo Slam was a disappointing, even boring read. The book starts well enough with an intriguing story about three kids abandoned by their father. Crais ruins the book by solving the mystery quickly in the first half of the book. That leaves about a hundred pages for utterly unbelievable shootouts and a farcically complicated end-game designed by Elvis. Are we supposed to find the notion of multiple shoot-outs believable? Is Elvis immortal? Can he in fact be killed? You could skip the final part of the book -- I skimmed it."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Finally got to this one in the Elvis Cole series; although I do not know why it was passed over both by starting with Voodoo River, then recent entries and finally jumping on the back trail, a familiar process when I discover an intersting writer. This leads to treasures but also disappointments. This novel is neither. It has a solid plot, although I think one of the final twists is really unnecessary for the conclusion and may be a gratuitous slap at Feds. Pike is simply too shadowy and it is clear that Lucy's ex-husband is being set up for a role in a sequel. As ususal Crais has a strong sense of place, smooth construction and an eventful plot. I rather like some of the wit and joking of Cole and enjoy his irreverent attitude, but I do think the writer pushes it just a bit. The novel does not get bogged down in the technicalities of detecting, lawyering, or policing - a problem in many ""thrillers"" today. All in all, a good read for a rainy Sunday."
4,"Fast-paced, fun book.","For Elvis Cole it looks like an easy case. Three kids walk into his office and want to hire him to find their missing father. Before it's over Cole is up to his neck in the Russian mafia, Vietnamese patriots, the Federal witness protection program, and a ""funny money"" scheme.The book is well plotted and moves along nicely, with a few unexpected twists and turns. Cole is his usualy wise-cracking self and Joe Pitt is as quiet and grim as ever. I've read all of Mr. Crais' novels and I don't know if this is better than the rest, but it's just as good. These guys always remind me of Robert Parker's Spenser and Hawk characters with their byplay. All in all a good book."
2,"Ugh, more reading.","This book is terribly boring and I would suggest purchasing Ethnomathematics or Blackfoot Physics instead. I love mathematics and reading, and I couldn't even finish this one. If you try to read this cover to cover, good luck. I didn't even like spot-searching for my research paper. Oh yeah, what's with no index in this book?"
3,Never Stop Dancing,"John Lawry has an excellent way with words when it comes to describing college to freshman. In this book, he and his daughter communicate about how her freshamn year is going. Since Lawry is a college profesor himself, he has alot to add. Another one of his books, ""College 101"", I also reccomend, if you enjoy this one. Definetly an excellent choice for parents to not only read themselves, but to send with their child to college."
5,Huggly goes to school,I liked this book because it is funny. It will make people laugh really hard probaly because it is so funny. It is a really good book for kids. This book is really interesting. Huggly goes to school is a good and fun book.
4,"great canning tool, keeps fingers cool","This little gadget allows you to magnetically pick up the lids from the hot simmering water for your canning jars. Saves burned finger tips, and proves much more sanitary than other methods. Had hoped for a bit more umph in the magnet, but I suppose then it would pick up two lids? I would highly recommend, and now wouldn't be without it!"
5,Back to Basics 174 Magnetic Lid Lifter,This tool is very handy for retrieving lids and rings from hot water. No more burned fingers. JERS
3,Okay,This case doesn't hold up the tablet as advertised. It constantly falls down. It's okay as a case only but doesn't stand up tablet as stated
1,It was cheap and I got what I paid for,Magnet is weak and the product is cheap. I can barely get a hot lid out of the water bath. 1/2 the time the lid falls back into the pan. I was expecting a magnet that could lift the lid from the center and instead the lid dangles from an edge. I could probably make something better myself from arts & craft supplies. Maybe that's what they mean by 'Back to Basics'...
3,Good item,"but magnet could be stronger. If you are just lifting the lids as is it works great but I heat mine in a water bath as is recommended and then they don't grip/hold onto the lids as well. I felt like this was a great idea, just needed a stronger magnet to warrant 5 stars."
2,Wish I would have read the reviews,"The idea is great, but like everyone else, the Magnet needs to be stronger, I do a better job with tongs, when boiling the lids....."
2,Lid Lifter,Great concept and inexpensive but does not grab onto the lids securely. Almost a balancing act to keep the lid hanging on the magnet when lifting it out of the water. Would not buy again.
3,Nice to have; Wish the magnet was stronger.,"Purchased because I have burned my fingers so many times I am missing fingerprints. This is useful, however the magnet could be a little stronger. I am still glad I purchased it."
5,My Go-To Book,"I have her original book and her book about laundry. I needed to refer to this one when my sister was visiting, and when she started reading it, she was fascinated. I ordered the most recent version for her birthday and now wish I had ordered it for myself as well. The updated book has additional tips and a section in the back that give substitutions (i.e., the substitution for fabric softener is vinegar in the rinse cycle). This has been my go-to book for many years. Couldn't do without it!!!"
4,Flustered Housekeeper,"Being a working person, I was interested in this title -- who among us has no dirt or stains. Not only does she make absolute sense, she uses things I have at home to remove stains. I never would have used WD-40 for removing a stain...I thought it would leave a stain. No! Use grease to loosen grease, then detergent to remove the grease. No wonder Oprah had The Queen of Clean on her show. She was wonderful and so's the book. Thank you."
4,Unbelievably Easy Directions!,"This book is amazing! With everyday stuff most of us have around the house anyway, the author shows how to get out the worst stains: grass, baby spitup, ink...you name it! And who'd have thought you could clean burnt up food on casserole dishes with used dryer softener sheets?! I don't know how she came up with these ideas, but they work! Consider this book as a gift for a bachelor setting up his apartment, for a wedding shower gift, but especially for yourself! It will save you money and hours of frustration."
1,"Be careful unless your job is finding, making and using cleaning products.","The book has some good ideas. one of the homemade solutions for cleaning the kitchen and tile was very good. However, some of the solutions are messy and you can buy good commerical products that work as well if not better. Most of the homemade products take time to make and additional time to use and additional effort(elbow grease). A number of the commercial products she recommends are difficult to find and expensive. She champions the ACT Natural products. I found them to be expensive, their web page is not easy to use, and they did not answer their telephone during their self proclaimed business hours."
3,Don't confuse this with a motivational book,"This book is excellent for its intended use, which is a guide on specific cleaning products and methods for cleaning your home. But don't look here for motivation or guidance on how to get started on cleaning a house that's a big mess and keeping it clean--you won't find that here."
5,Long Live The Queen Of Clean!,"This was the very first book that I read about house-cleaning and after all of these years, it is the first book that I turn to when I encounter a cleaning emergency. It's simple, straight-forward and witty and you feel that you're talking to a friend throughout. Her solutions to common everyday cleaning dilemmas are simple and they work! Highly recommend!"
5,The Queen of Clean rules our household,"""Talking Dirty with the Queen of Clean"" has become my bible. I had the chance to have the Queen of Clean come to my house for an Oprah segment,we were the stain family, and she was amazing. Her solutions to household cleaning is great. I have three small children who make big messes so the Queen of Clean's book is always nearby ready to help solve all my problems. Everyone that I have told about the book have been on there way to get one as soon as they look through it. The cleaning solutions are as suprising as they are useful. This is a must have book for everyone. I only wish I had had one earlier."
5,A great book !!!! A must for all households.,The complete book on cleaning your household!! Great Job Queen !!! Can't wait to read your next book!
2,TALKING DIRTY WITH THE QUEEN OF CLEAN,MORE OR THE SAME THING I HAVE READ IN OTHER BOOKS. NOTHING NEW. THOUGHT IT WOULD GIVE ME MORE SOLUTIONS TO THINGS. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
2,"Disjointed, superficial, annoying","If you want a list of ""cute"" ways to try removing stains (the only suggested method my chemist husbands thinks may risk serious damage is soaking your plumbing in vinegar for hours---if it's white metal, that is), well, sure. But there's so much more to keeping clean than that! No advice on how to avoid serious staining in the first place, no advice on long-term steady maintenance, very little advice on materials found in older houses, and way too much Tang and used dryer sheets. What I missed most, though, were coherent explanations of how or why these methods were supposed to work.A very TV-style book, with a very TV level of discourse and organization. The Queen should stick to talk shows. (And you should buy Cheryl Mendelson's _Home_Comforts_ instead.)"
2,superficial,"This isn't a book; it's a list. It's a list of ideas for cleaning using products you make yourself. Nowhere does the author state that she thinks her home-made products are better than those on the market, nor does she give the reader a justifiable motive for using her ideas. She doesn't explain the why or the how; one is left assuming that she comes up with these ideas for a living and doesn't care if they're better or not. All the same, I plan on trying baking soda on my bath tub since nothing else has worked."
3,Talking Dirty W/ the Queen of Clean,"This book provides a source for finding specific remedies for your cleaning needs. It does not read like a book, but is more useful if you have a particular type of stain, and need a quick reference."
4,A classic...,"I only bought this books for a history class. But after I read it this story offers many lessons and its humor stands the test of time. I liked it, it was cheaper than the school bookstore and i still own it."
4,You need this CD,"My sister sent me this CD for my recent birthday. I'm glad she did. This is a nasty, greasy mix of full-on funk, R&B, and soul ripped out by some masters in Memphis. These cats played with Isaac Hayes, Booker T and the M.G.'s, and sat in on Stax sessions. They throw down the jams live to tape and we get to listen in. If you want some music that feels like late 60s music updated for today - this is your stuff. Daddy like. Smoke up some ribs and spin this ASAP."
3,Annoying Trumpet but Otherwise OK,"When I first got this CD I was really pumped up, and the first few times I played it, I was pretty darn excited. The story is a great one--an ofay bass player brining back together the crack Stax session players to lay down some cuts in Willie Mitchell's Memphis studio. Whoa!After some more plays, however, some of the thrill is gone. This is good stuff, but not great stuff. The trumpet playing annoyed me even on the first listen; I surely wish they had decided not to include a trumpet in these sessions.Still, if you are a fan of the old Memphis sound, then you will want to give The Royal Sessions an audition. It may not be a great recording, but it really is pretty good."
4,Red Krayola - 'Singles' (Drag City),"I remember the very issue of Alternative Press that I read about the release of this twenty-one track collection of Red Krayola singles. I never even knew they put out that many. I couldn't locate hardly any of these songs anywhere else - so I'm under the impression that each one of these tunes are strictly exclusive to this Drag City-label title. A bit different than what I had expected. For one thing - many of these songs are more 'accessible' than I thought they would be. In other words, 'Singles' isn't near as weird as I assumed it would be. Tunes well worth mentioning are ""Pig Ankle Strut"", the (sort of) rocking ""Micro-Fish And Chips"", the true (in every sense of the word) Avant Garde ""An Old Man's Dream"", the almost Gong-like ""Zukunftsfleiger"", ""The Red Krayola On Forty-Five"" and ""Chemistry"". CD's full title is 'Singles 1968-2002' as it gives the true fan and followers a good taste of the band's music through out the thirty-four time span."
2,Not what I was expecting at all,"When I bought this book, I thought I would learn some ways to enhance my pictures with detailed examples. I was really disappointed when I saw that it wasn't the case. They show what they did with what tool but without any detailed explanations. ""Before-and-after-color-balance"" wasn't what I had in mind when I bought this book. I didn't need to pay 50$ to know that if I go through photoshop menus and do some tests, I would learn it sooner or later. I really think it should be mentionned that this book is intended for people that have beginner skills with computers. 30% of the book explains how to use a scanner...The only way I would recommend this book is if you don't know much about computers and have no clue what photoshop is and want to know where the menu for Hue/Saturation is. Otherwise, don't waste any penny on that, instead, go to specialized website, you'll find tutorials that are a 100 times better than this book with real detailed examples."
1,A complete waste of money,"I found this book to be a very poor educational source for digital photography and image editing. As a photographer who is switching from slide film to digital, I have read three other books on digital photography, including Peter Burian's ""Mastering Digital Photography and Imaging"". Burian's book (and the other two books) blow's the Drafahl's book out of the water(no pun intended). It's like comparing a Lexus to a Hugo. The Drafahl book is vague, poorly written, and provides minimal imformation on various topics. What's with the large print and skipped lines--it's as though they wanted to increase the number of pages to make it look like your getting more for your money. I have wasted my money to finance one of their dive trips."
3,Good for beginners,This book is good for those just entering into digital photography for the underwater world. It should specify that it is for beginners to as to avoid disappointing those who are already experienced in digital photography.
2,not impressed,"Imak Ergonomic Back Cushion #30122 - Imak ProductsAfter reading the reviews on this product I ordered it with confidence that I would be pleased. As it turns out, I am not. I find it to be just an average product, and should have spent the extra money on a firmer lumbar cushion. This one has so little support in its center. It's not something I would recommend if you're looking for a high quality firm support for your back."
2,Pillow is a marshmallow,"Pillow is made of low quality foam that is way too soft to provide adequate support. If the pillow sits in the sun, it becomes even softer...the knobby things don't do much for me. Pillow is definitely not a value given its pricing. A pillow is probably best bought in a store where you can see if it performs to your liking."
1,NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY,"I bought this for my son to use in the car, he is 16 and learning to drive and has back issues. The first day he used it the strap broke and he said it is not very comfortable. I would not recommend buying this, I am looking for a better one for my son."
2,Expensive Pillow,"Picture makes this product look a bit fancy. Something you'd see in Sharper Image or on a space shuttle. It's a good little pillow, but that's about it. I tried to use this in my Ford Ranger to provide lower back support. It started out great. Then the strap broke. Now, a few months later it's a flat, lifeless little thing that falls on the ground every time I get out of the vehicle. Not worth the money. If you need back support while driving, just use one of the little pillows in the guest room. You know, the one on the rocking chair that says ""Worlds Greatest Fisherman"" or something, and save your money."
2,Cheri,"The acting was good...........disappointed in the story line. Purchased it because of Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathy Bates.Liked the period sets and costumes, however, sure wouldn't have liked wearing them!"
3,Cheri,"I experience no problems regarding this item. It was received timely, and in good condition as specified."
3,Not bad but too skinny!!!,"After all the critical acclaim this movie received i was looking forward to see this movie.The story was quite good,the acting too,the music was particularly nice also.Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful but unfortunately i thought that she looked painfully thin and the dresses she wore seemed to just hang on her ,women in that era were quite plump and i just did not see her as a believable courtisane.Cathy Bates was miscast in this role i feel.She was badly overacting and i think they should have used an english actress to play the part, maybe Emma Thomson or Miranda Richardson.Rupert Friend was good and believable in the part and i see a great future for him at the movies.Don't get me wrong it wasn't unpleasant but but it could have been so much better."
3,Solid Adaptation,"After having read this originally in French, I decided to watch the movie. I wasn't really expecting much because I'm honestly just not a fan of michelle pfeiffer, but surprisingly, this movie follows the book very well, and also captures the overall mood and tone of the story. I wouldn't say that this movie as a whole is really good, it can be bland at times, and for some reason I found the annoying ""narrator"" very distracting, but Michelle definitely embodied the role and so did the male actor who played Cheri. Planning to read the book again, but not the movie so much, just because I find it somewhat forgettable. Nonetheless, still, a surprisingly good well-done adaptation that followed the book exactly from start to finish. Major respect for that."
2,"Love Michelle Pfeiffer, just not this movie. It was dull","If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. It was deadly dull anddepressing. Love Michelle, not the movie."
1,Awful,This movie was one giant yawn! It was so boring it's not even worth a proper review. I did like the costumes and sets. That's the only positive I can give.
1,1 star is being gracious..,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The Michele Pfiefer and Cathy Bates characters were ridiculously over acted and the fact that they threw in a narrator...not quite like Anthony Hopkins narration in Grinch but more like an Edward R. Murrow cover...explaining things to the viewer since the dialogue was incapable. And the ending....oh the ending. A more suitable ending would have been for the poor saps like me who wasted 1.5 hrs. of their lives to blow THEIR brains out.
2,Bland,"After reading other reviews I'm glad I never finished the book. I would have liked it even less. Contrary to what most have said here, I didn't care for the 1st 3rd of the book. While I found the premise interesting, I found the way it was handled uninteresting. I didn't believe the characters or their interactions, nor did I believe the prison."
3,Lost in Prison,"This is a pretty good read. It's probably easiest to describe this as a science fiction prison escape story, but that doesn't quite do it justice.The main plot revolves around seventeen year old Felicitas as she slowly becomes consciously aware of her situation- trapped in a prison, kept captive by inscrutable alien robot guards and strange machines. The setting is pretty interesting, and it takes a while to really figure out what the heck is going on.The characters in this book are not very deep, including the protagonist. This may be because of their circumstances, but many of the secondary characters seem sort of bland.The main plot is very strange and somewhat convoluted, and I don't want to spoil it by giving away to much, but aliens and time travel are involved.Still, I liked this book. It sort of reminded me of the TV show Lost in some ways. It's not the greatest thing I've ever read, but it was enjoyable enough that I stayed up late to finish it."
3,Good but not great,"One thing in favor of this book is it was different than most other books I've read. While I was reading it, the writing was compelling enough that I was interested & didn't want to quit reading. But when I wasn't reading, it wasn't a book I thought about or looked forward to reading. And I haven't given the story another thought since I finished reading it a few weeks ago. So it's not bad, enjoyable while you're reading it, but nothing lasting."
3,"Excellent First Half, but slips up in the second half",I read the whole thing in one sitting. It was definitely a page turner. The way Mackay set up the mystery of the spooky automated prison was aboslutely wonderful. But the story degenerate somewhere in the middle. The human interactions are kinda unconvincing. The plot link to Machivellie is strenous at best and the way he resolved it wasn't a satisfying climax.
4,"Bending time, and the destruction of all life...","Imagine the perfect prison. It would be completely automated, all of the prisoners would be docile, and it would be on an uninhabited planet. This is exactly where Felicitas, a 17-year-old girl, finds herself one day. She, ""wakes up,"" with no memories of actually committing a crime, and no memories of her childhood. She soon finds that other prisoners are waking up, and that some have been awake for quite awhile. Her prison is breaking down. The equipment which was meant to guard the prisoners and keep them docile is failing. Many of the prisoners who are awake now, are planning on escape. Felicitas is a key to their escape because of certain things she knows. Unfortunately she can't remember those things. Outpost is a very good book. It does have some weak points, but for Scott Mackay's first science fiction novel it is a stellar performance."
1,Do not waste your money,"I wish I had seen these reviews prior to buying this. My husband, who is very strong was barely able to force it to cut a potato. In the time it took for him to get one through the blades I had two peeled and diced with a knife. Huge waste of money!"
1,Use a knife!,"This is just junk. I purchaced this on sale, thinking that Kitchenaid was synonymous with Quality. Not this time. It balks as soon as a potato was even with the height of the blade. Being a stubborn man, I leaned on it and it started to move again. Little did I know that the metal blades were slicing through the flimsy plastic instead of the potato. The apple slicer worked much better, lasting 4 apples before breaking, instead of 1 potato. The item won't slice, but it will break. It looks very nice, so it is only suitible for giving to annoying relatives that get you cheap crap for Christmas. Don't expect to get any use out of it."
1,Junk,I am a reasonably strong man who found that the blades are so dull the french fry cutter would not cut lengthwise through a large potato without undue force. Because of this I consider this slicer to be somewhat dangerous.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this to simplify making fries, it was a disappointment. It takes a lot of effort to push through a potato, and when it does go through it most likely won't go straight. Either save your money and use a knife, or spend more and get a mandoline."
1,first kitchenaid appliance that is not good.,Very low quality and I am very surprised that Kitchenaid puts its name on this product. I highly DO NOT reccommend this product. I agree with all the other reviews about this product and was in denial until I bought one myself.
2,Dated?,"Although I appreciated the one review given here, when I checked the copyright date (1986) I decided not to buy it. 21 years ago in computer (and MIDI) time is ancient history. Am looking for a more up-to-date book."
4,The PERFECT BEAT!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a flat out dope album hands down. Kweli never lets you down with the lyrics that will help your mind elevate to the next level. Whether the topic is religion, racism or just pure hip hop, kweli delivers scathing bars that will please most listeners. There are a couple songs that I skip on the album that keep this album from getting a five star rating from me (like hot thing). Stand out songs to me are THE PERFECT BEAT featuring the god emceee KRS-One, Country cousins, and the intro everything man. This is an excellent album is HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!!"
5,True hip-hop,"What can I say, besides the fact that it's great. The lyrics as usual are strong, and so no the typical mess, we hear on the radio. If you want to hear a brotha talking about the real, pick this up."
4,probably his best yet,"this cd is amazing.a lot of songs are constantly on repeat.i'm not good at giving complete reviews because i figured you guys reading just want the goods and are short on time.basically, it has some low points but he talks about a lot of issues that need to be addressed.the beats are AMAZING. WOW...the production on this cd is very impressive.talib is always coming with the lyrics so...just buy it. i recommend it"
3,"Great lyrics, substandard beats",Talib always delivers great lyrical concepts and content but the music tracks are lacking. The beats are ordinary and boring. This CD is still far better than the awful Top Ten rap tracks on the Billboard charts that have NO lyrical content
2,Kwelity over Quantity,"Being a BlackStar fan I have high hopes for both Kweli and Mos to continue their stellar rhymes over dope beats... It's hard to say it but ever since Kweli's freshman album (Reflection Eternal) each year that passes, his skills deteriorate. I thought Beautiful Struggle was bad, this one is worse!!His flows doesn't have the tricky metaphors he used to deliver and his word play skills is struggling, his vocab is elementry, and his knowledge is on a grassroot level.. He doesn't fwok with the mind anymore. And most of the beats are mediocre. There are some glimpses of Kwelity from tracks like: ""Everything Man"", ""NY Weather Report"", ""In The Mood"" & ""Soon The New Day"". BUT 4 songs out of 20?? That's not even 25%..Last good album Kweli dropped is Quality, and this is exactly what Kweli is lacking.... My advice cop the new Mos album, it takes you back to hip hop of old, it has a old skool feel to it (late 70s early 80s)."
4,Fell Off!,"He was good on Soundbombing 2, after that he fell the f#$% off. He should have done at least 2 more underground projects before he decided to go main stream. Every album after soundbombing 2 had mediochre beats. My bad Y'all I meant this review for ""Quality"" not eardrum. Eardrum was actually a good album."
5,A Great Solid Album From A Great MC,"I have been a fan of talib kweli since the days of liberation and blackstar. He brings in a unique style to hip-hop that never fails to offer something fresh each album. Eardrum had great instrumentals to compliment his cleverness and flow that creates a good piece of work. If your one who likes to hear a lot of club type music or something to play at a party, this may not be what your looking for. This is a great wonderful masterpiece that displays what rap music is supposed to sound like. Lyrically clever with a good flow."
4,"Well, more like 4.25 stars. Excellent book.","The story 'Self Storage' is fantastic. After reading it in, i believe, the Iowa Review, i immediately ordered the book. The stories are very real, very engaging.If you're into Tobias Wolff i strongly recommend this book. Actually, i strongly recommend it period."
5,"The red light, the naked man, and a toilet...","Self Storage ranges from a Croatian family in America, to men and their baseball, to cars with red lights that keep coming on, to the well-crafted title story that offers commentary and philosophy on the materialistic accumulation of ""stuff"".Mary Helen Stefaniak's sense of character, tight and unwavering language, and especially voice, make her writing very pleasing to read. She offers a nice blend of entertainment, intelligence, and humorous observations in every story.You'll be telling your friends about Staramajka, the naked man, you'll empathize a little more with your grandma, and you might rethink your life a bit when you step back to look at your own self storage; Stefaniak's writing is that powerful."
2,"Pretty Design, but...","I really liked the design of these earrings, but the pair I received wasn't as light as the online photo and there were very few marcasites, so they didn't sparkle. I returned them."
3,Good basic abacus book and good beginner's abacus,"I bought this at a local bookstore and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's an entertaining read, often humorous. Dillon explains how to do the four basic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for decimal numbers and even includes a section on binary arithmetic!Most of the book focuses on the techniques for using an abacus, but it also covers some of the historical aspects of the development of mathematics.This book is best for older kids and adults since it can be kind of dry at times. While it includes instructions for building an abacus, the 9-column Chinese-style ""5/2"" abacus that comes with the book is very nice for beginners.Unfortunately, there are a number of things the book does not teach, such as finding roots. Still, it's well worth a look."
1,Amazingly salty (in a bad way),"I bought this salmon, attracted by the ""Skinless & Boneless"" label (I usually buy the alaskan salmon from Crown Prince).Let's just say that this was a huge mistake. This salmon has 630 mg of sodium per can, and while that doesn't sound like much, the salmon is amazingly salty. If you intend to use it in your cooking, perhaps this would be alright, however, it is impossible to eat as is. This salmon also smells less like salmon, and more like some other kind of fish (which really does not appeal to me much - if I wanted some other fish, I would have gotten it).Basically, right now I'm stuck with 11 cans of salmon that I really have no use for (the first can that I opened made it quite clear that it's the last can I would open). Unfortunately, I don't have a cat. Will look for a food drive to donate this expensive disaster."
2,grandmom,"Crown Prince Natural Skinless/Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)I wouldn't know how it tastes because it smelled so fishy that I couldn'teat it. I gave it to my cats who loved it."
2,Not very sturdy,"I had purchased wire tomato cages from a local hardware store years ago. I purchased these because they were the same height as the others and I thought they would be made similar. These are made from thinner wire and not as sturdy. They have served the purpose to contain the tomato plants, but they have bent under the weight of the plants. I would recommend the manufacture consider using a heavier gauge wire for the next product upgrade."
3,Calmer side of the Mahones,"I really like this album because I'm already a huge fan but it's not the album to introduce yourself to this band with. Draggin' the Days and Rise Again do a better job of capturing the high energy celtic/punk spirit of this band and get you hooked. They would be better albums to buy if you haven't heard the Mahones before. Albums aside though, you can't replace the experience of seeing these guys live."
4,Very Good DVD,"I really like the pace of this DVD, and the exercises are easy to follow. One thing I'd don't like is having to pause the DVD every time when working left & right sides of the body. You are shown an exercise for one side and then told to pause the DVD and repeat for the other side. Other than that it's a great workout."
5,Excellent for proper form and range,"I have a ton of weight training instructional materials but I really must rate this as the best in terms of teaching proper form and exact range of motion. It makes me crazy when people waste their time and get sore performing weight exercises incorrectly. This will insure that you know what the best form is and the exact execution to get the results you want from each muscle group. I also loved the explicit descriptions of which muscles were being targeted for each exercise. No, there are no manically grinning instructors barking and joking with you, but I'm sure we all have several of those in our collection. This is the best dvd I've seen concerned with teaching you what proper form is. I always forget how easy it is to use momentum to complete the range and that it's cheating! Glad I bought this!"
2,not recommended,This seems like a home made DVD.It is short exercises that you must go back to the menu to go to the next exercise.It would be better if it were just continuous.
2,Gene Fernandez wrote:,"Sir Edward's flourished language, abundant similes, abuse of allegories and excesive metaphores make this book a typical example of the 1800's English pedantry. It muddles the plot and take it through mazes of unrelated avenues which hide the wisdom under the effort to display the culture that is not called for or even welcomed by the bored reader."
1,Was looking for all instrumental,"I thought I had done my homework, but almost every selection on here is song from an opera. Was looking for solid instrumental-only Baroque music. Very disappointing..went straight to the thrift store."
3,OK but,"I liked it ok but thought it was like watching a new series episode,not a movie.One would expect more from a movie.Unanswered questions with the new leader like who is he and why was he doing the things he did? I agree with others about the new Daisy.Just was not up there with the old series.Kind of disappointing."
1,Disappointed too,I was sooooo disappointed. It was very slow moving and I was actually bored. I had enjoyed the series and expected much more here. Too bad.
1,Lacked,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD. I am sorry but I miss Daisy and Rube. The actor who is playing Daisy well, she just doesn't cut it. The movie just lacked the excitement that the series gave. I would recommend that you wait until you can buy at 5.00."
1,why...,"Let me emphasize how much I LOVED the series. I watched it twice now, and I got my friend addicted to it. I was ultimately disappointed when they decided to cancel such a great series. When I heard they were going to make a movie, I perked up a bit, and got even more disappointed when I watched it. I have lost the plot, the storyline, the funnies/sarcasm was gone! The character change was a huge blow to me since...well...no matter how much you act, you can't be like the original (ex: daisy). I am fine with the series I already own, but I won't be looking to add the movie to my collection."
4,Missing Link,"For Dead Like Me series fans, you won't be disappointed by George, Roxy or Mason. They were written true to character.On the other hand, Daisy became violent, crass and ditzy. Gone is the finesse that Laura Harris brought to the character, which is what made Daisy so endearing and lovely. It's hard to say whether the problem with the character is more due to the writing or how the actor, Sarah Wynter, portrayed her. But the performance is worse than Daisy's theater debut...E-I-E-I-O.Britt McKillip did a fine job as Reggie. I liked the interaction between George and Reggie...but shouldn't breaking the rules bring ""Reapercussions""???I would have given the movie 5 stars if Daisy would have been more true to the series character. I just don't care for the direction the character has taken."
1,Stick with Seasons 1 & 2,"Not much new to add--if you loved the show, stay FAR away from this ""movie."" The characters are horrible--mere caricatures of the wonderfully vibrant individuals from the TV series who act completely *out* of character--especially Roxy. The plot is heavy-handed and ridiculous, and lacks the morality and subtlety of the series. Stick with the two wonderful seasons--I wish I had."
1,Awful. Just awful.,"Perhaps the producers should have taken the series' own advice and let the dead just move on. This sequel was too much like a zombie raised from the grave and forced to dance.The series was great. I really enjoyed both seasons. This follow-on straight-to-DVD production, however, was really not very fun for me at all. The characters, who had been developing quite nicely in the series, were slammed (painfully) back in to one-dimensional clowns that were mere shadows of what they had been.Too many ""forced"" scenes as well. They clearly showed the rough edges of trying to squeeze too many events into a single script. Not wanting to spoil anything, I won't describe them here, but there were too many times my reaction was, ""where the hell did THAT come from?""If you liked the series, don't watch this sequel. I don't see how you could be anything but disappointed in it."
3,Frustratingly uneven,"There were lots of small moments that reminded me of my favorite parts of the show, like the little girl reaper who takes the cat's soul, but they were mired in a production that was more than a cut below the series. The plot had promise, but the recasting of Daisy and the inferior writing sank it. If Laura Harris wasn't available, they should have waited. And the whole cast deserved better writing than what they got."
1,Surprisingly bad,"I don't usually write reviews. I don't usually try to tear shows, movies, or books apart. I try really hard to find some good in the production values at the very least...If a film is made as a fan service to fans of a very well written show, why would they bother to ignore very key elements to the story, or to the inner workings of the characters and reapers.This film is abysmal. I do not say that lightly. Many points were actually difficult to watch.Yes I did halfheartedly laugh a few times, it may have been more of an involuntary reaction at best.Seriously... as a fan of the show and a fan of things which at least have heart behind them; This movie is terrible."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I was a huge fan of the series and looked forward to this movie to see what loose ends they would tie up. Sad to say, very few.This movie reminded me of the bad movies of the week they show on Sci-Fi more than anything else. The actors appeared to be sleep walking through their roles and the plot was terrible. The actress playing Daisy had no clue what Daisy was all about and the other regular actors appeared to mainly want to do the movie, get a paycheck and move on to other things.Like someone else has noted in their review, I wanted to turn this off after about 10 minutes, but watched the whole thing in the vain hope it would finally improve.All in all - if you are a fan of the series, skip this movie because it will do nothing but make you cry over how poor a job it is."
4,Worth The Wait,"As a fan of the series, I patiently (or not) waited for the release of this movie for a long time. But it was worth it! All the wonderful characters were back (without Rube, of course), and now there's a different actress portraying ""Daisey"", but in the end none of that mattered. It was nice to see how most of the characters had evolved, especially ""George."" I was glad to see ""Reggie"" get to a place where she could deal with her sister's death and forgive her mother for whatever shortcomings she has. The tear-jerker part at the end almost totally destroyed me. Having just lost my own cat of age-related illness in December, I came completely unstuck when I saw the small ""reaper"" take the soul of ""Murray"", ""Delores'"" beautiful cat. All in all, a well-done continuation of the series and a more satisfying conclusion at the same time."
3,"Movie ""Jumped the Shark"" for the series...","Like watching the movie of Gilligan's Island, it was fun to see most of the returning cast. Although I'm not as devoted as other fans of the series by memorizing the actors's names instead of their character names, seeing the show was akin to reuniting with missed friends. Those thespians who returned to the movie honored the viewers by reprising their acting roles as if they were shivering skiers donning cozy and fuzzy robes after a long day on the slopes.Desapite all this, I believe the movie has ""Jumped the Shark"" or ""Nuked the Fridge"" for the series (It's kinda hard to determine which metaphor is appropriate in this case-- so maybe ""Nuking the Shark"" would be best).It's pleasant for fans to see the actors again in their roles, but it's best to let the series pass away quietly after this lone movie. I wonder if there are reapers for dead tv series?"
2,dead like me dead again,"Replacement actors suckedStory line not so goodDVD bad I mean bad it made noices all the through outOrginal crew did goodfor a dead person to show themself's to their family then die again""dead like me dead again"" stick a fork in it's done"
5,Awesome movie hope to see more like this one,"Loved every minute of the film, Very similar to the series in fact look like long episode of the series, I hope they will make couple of continue movie episodes in the future. Like serenity to fire fly series comes DLM after death to continue DLMShame MGM decided to kill the series in the first place."
2,George the best!,"Really enjoyed the continuation of Georgia Lass (Millie). The rest of the reapers just got lost in the shuffle. MGM stated they would restart the series if the sales were good, maybe it shouldn't. Would really like to remember ""Dead Like Me"" from the two seasons rather than the film. I gave this movie 2 stars because it just didn't match up to the series. I would have hoped that it would be an extension to the series, but wasn't excited about how it turned out. My views are my own, but others might agree."
3,Not even close.,Just a big disappointment for me. Loved the show but this didn't even compare to it for me. Waste of my money.
5,Best last line EVER!!!,"I've seen this already! (It aired in canada)If you liked the show, the movie was done with the same type of humor, and the storyline was consistant with how the characters would have acted in the same situations.The show handled the loss of Rube (mandy pankin) very well, and did it in such a way as to make it look flawless. The show keeps its edge.There were a couple of moments where I said something like ""I thought reggie knew..."" but this is supposedly 5 years past george's death, and lets face it. Life goes on.Personally, I thought the last line of the entire movie was the best ever! It was just the perfect line, for the perfect moment and fit the characters sooo well(I've really tried hard not to include spoilers here, which is why this seems so disjoined with words like ""the character"" instead of character names)This is a must have to go with season 1 and 2!!!"
5,The perfect closure,I am a true fan of this series. My own father died just before the series started. It helped me laugh and grieve. I am glad I found this movie for rent on Amazon. I miss the show. The movie is the perfect closure and new beginning for Muth's character Georgia.
3,Not too bad !,"If your a dead like me lover this is the drug to my fix, but..... It took too long to get back into the feel of the story again. Hope there is another movie I will certainly buy it. P.S I miss Rube."
1,Terrible,"This was the first Dead Like Me show I've seen and I was astounded at how bad it was. Cheap, manipulative, predictable, poor acting, poor directing, poor dialogue, cheap effects, etc etc. It really is a prime example of really bad direct-to-dvd content."
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed watching this film. After watching the series on DVD I was hoping for an awesome movie to wrap it all up. I got the impression the actors weren't really into it and the dialog was amateur compared to the series. Why replace the actor for Daisy? The movie would have been better for her to have been written out like Rube was than replaced with someone new. The only positive for me is now there is closure.
2,poor representation of a great show,"This movie doesn't even come close to the quality of the show. They didn't get a number of important characters from the original cast, a ton of things in the movie weren't explained, and the plot felt very forced.Unless you're a fan of the show, this isn't worth watching. And even then, it's a stretch."
1,one of the worse films I've ever seen,"Oh, my goodness.This movie is simply AWFUL.No plot, no good actors, no sense at all!How can a director spend good money on that???"
1,Dead Like Me: Did Not Resusitate,I really liked the series and hoped for a return of the series (for a few more seasons) or a series of movies. This was a big let down.There are already several good detailed reviews here that all I can add is I agree that this sucked.
1,Disappointed in Daisy.,"I wanted to love this movie, because I am a huge fan of the series. While it does add on to the story, it's just disappointing. For me, the whole movie was pretty much ruined by Daisy Adair being played by a new actress who didn't understand the character. Daisy is definitely ""friendly"" in the series, but she has a heart and insecurities, and that's why people love her. This movie's version of Daisy doesn't have the heart, and loses her charm. It might have been better to leave the series as it was. This movie has it's moments, but it's too far from the show."
4,Loved it! Its about time too!,"I loved the Dead Like Me series and was very bummed out when they stopped after the second season. This was the only show that I liked even better than Buffy. When I heard that they had made a fallow up movie I had to have it. It doesn't have the same Daisy in it and I don't like this one any better than the other one either. George is as good looking as ever and has grown up a lot. Roxy is the same as ever to start with, gets lost for awhile then starts kicking ass again. Mason has grown up a little but is still pretty much the same. I miss the Der Waffle House but it wouldn't be the same without Rube in it. I miss Rube and cant stand the guy that takes his place so what they do to him in the end is fine. Overall I really liked the movie and I'm glad that I bought the DVD. A lot of people have said that they don't like this one but I did. I just wish they would bring the series back."
1,"Wow, Epically bad.","If a show has been over for 3 years, and didn't have a proper ending, WHY WHY WHY would you make a movie that doesn't tie up loose ends?Once the film ended the only words we could think was ""WHY did that need to be made.""I absolutely love the show. One of my top ten.Why this movie fails:-Loss of Rube. No characters seemed to even care that he was gone.-Loss of Daisy and replaced by someone doing a bad impression of her.-Dry boring script.-Emotionless dialogue being delivered by cast.- Different locations trying to be passed off as the originals.- Threw out old reaping rules and stomped all over what was set up.- 25 person cat funeral.- Different cinematography didn't match old aesthetic.- Wasn't made for fans, new comers wont enjoy.Just bottom of the barrel production. I don't know why there are so many gleaming reviews. I think once more true fans see this wreck of a great show, the true ratings will come out.Rewatch the series and pass on this."
2,What happened?,"I was so excited to learn that ""Dead Like Me"" was not dead after all. But fans of Showtime's excellent dark comedy will be disappointed with this feature length update of George (toilet seat girl) and the merry band of reapers. Key cast members are missing, most notably Mandy Patinkin as father figure Rube, and their replacements simply are not up to par. Ellen Muth, deadpan as George doesn't have Rube's affable smarminess to play off of and just comes across as a fraction of the smart aleck she used to be. All the reapers succumb to greed in one way or another at the hands of Rube's replacement with diastrous results, including George, who crosses the line and interacts with her still-grieving sister Reggie.It's just not a huge disappointment and I wish that they had left the series alone rather than have this disaster as the bookend of the series."
2,Not Nearly As Good As The Show,"No Mandy Patinkin; no Daisy (Daisy Adair); no Betty. George, Mason, Reggie, and Joy are all back, and there's an evil-ish Rube replacement, along with the wrong Daisy, who is both ditzier and easier without being charming. The storyline isn't all bad, but the writing is not up to par with the television show. That said, even if I had known the movie wouldn't hold up to the show, I would have bought it anyway because the show was so good."
1,The Movie That Wasn't,"A huge disservice was done to one of the greatest ensemble casts on television. This movie suffers greatly from lack of imagination. The wonderful characters we came to know in the series are - forgive the pun - ghosts of their former selves. At the end of the series, there were so many questions that could have been explored in a feature length film. Yet, for some reason, the writers decided not to explore anything relevant to the mysteries of life and death. They simply revisited old scenarios (what happens when you break the rules) while ignoring the rules themselves. And they apparently forgot that these characters already existed in the world of ""Dead Like Me"" for three years. Did the director even watch the series? I'm so saddened by this (lack of) effort and so sorry that this wonderful cast didn't get the chance they deserved to shine before a whole new audience."
2,"It's ""too little, too late"" ... they should've let sleeping dogs lie ...","Don't get me wrong ... I'm a HUGE fan of the original ""Dead Like Me"" series ... but this movie just seems ... lackluster, and a bit disappointing. No Rube, no Waffle House ... it doesn't seem to ""draw me in"" like the series did.I don't begrudge keeping these actors gainfully employed, but ... to echo the sentiments of another reviewer here ... ""the magic's GONE.""Season 2 kinda wrapped up the whole series, when George's voiceover in the last scene exclaimed, ""It's not so bad ... being dead like me."" They should have never messed with it."
2,Great series but bad movie,"Who is Cameron Kane and where is Ruben? I loved this series but the movie fell flat. They brought back all the original cast but one and never quite answered why or where he was. This was like watching a regular episode on TV but without the laughs and a bunch of unanswered questions.I was so happy to hear this movie was coming out and so hoping for some answers or maybe, just maybe having the series brought back, but from what I saw it is better left dead."
2,Something is missing..........,"I did not know ""Dead Like Me"" was a past series. This was the first I've heard of the movie. I was not impressed. I thought it was poorly written and the acting was pretty dismal. It could have been so much better. It was not remotely funny, even for dark humor. I would describe this movie as ""DULL""."
1,Worthless.,"I was in Barnes and Noble about a few weeks ago and, browsing in the DVD section, came across ""Dead Like Me"". I'd never watched the show, but was intrigued. I had the option of buying both seasons, the new movie ""revival"" of the series or both seasons PLUS the new movie in one package. I went with the last choice, thinking it was the best deal.Big mistake.I should have just bought the two seasons and enjoyed the heck out of a quirky, affecting, well-written and acted show which just got better with each episode. Instead, I watched those two great seasons and then had to suffer through an abysmal piece of crap movie. Other reviewers here have already described how bad it is -- I can't really add anything to these negative reviews, except to say that even the harshest is probably not harsh enough.Really... save your money and your time. Don't bother with this worthless junk."
2,I Wanted to Love It. :(,"I really did want to love it as i was a huge fan of the show, but it just didn't have the same feel to it. No Rube was a huge letdown and the new daisy was just terrible. Terrible! Delores was great and was probably the highlight of the movie. None of the other characters had the same feel or feeling. It's like they just walked through the motions. Sad to say i just didn't like it."
2,"A miss, or more of a farewell...","Very disappointing, the writers and director should be ashamed of taking this witty and poignant series and putting it to its demise. The absence of the ""real"" Daisy was a horrible mistake. The whole movie seemed pushed; a let's get it over with feeling. The only good vibe or surprise from the movie was the intro of Murray, the cat and seeing Reggie grown up to be a beautiful young woman. It was good to see all the old faces, minus that of Daisy, but was disheartening overall that it was not what the series was and should still be."
1,Fear the Reaper.,"When the series died, I was sad. I successfully saw the five stages of grief through to acceptance. And this movie brought me right back around to anger. Somehow, somebody thought it would be a good idea to resurrect it. But this ""movie"" isn't the good kind of resurrection. We're talking about a Pet Cemetery, don't mess with the natural order, kind of resurrection. It was a horrible, smelly zombie of it's former self. All of those positive reviews are by people who haven't seen an episode in the three years since the series shuffled off it's mortal coil and have just a vague remembrance of what it once was. If you loved the series as much as I did, you'll do well to avoid this movie like, well, the Grim Reaper."
1,Awful!,"We are die-hard fans of the series and were excited about the movie coming out. Well, P.U. -- a total stinker. The exposition was sloppy and rushed, characters were not true to the series, and cheesy cinematography effects just made it worse. (lots of slo-mo for emphasis) Just awful. The talented actors had nothing to work with though they seemed (excruciatingly) to try their hearts out. Really, nothing compelling at all. What a shame."
1,Super fan super disappointed.,After just watching the film for the first time with some friends who also really enjoy the show we're disappointed. I pretty much enjoy any film no matter the flaws but I strongly disliked this one. The acting was terrible by everybody except Reggie. There was basically no plot. no life lesson to death with. When i feel like reliving dead like me i will be watching the tv series on not this film
1,I'd Rate Zero If I Could,If you were a fan of the show stay away. There is nothing to redeem this movie. You'll never get those 90 minutes back.
1,A Tragic Mistake,"The paramount phrase here is DIRECT TO DVD. It sucked. Really sucked. Did I mention it sucked? Ellen, Jasmine, et al tried to pull it off but the script and directing were so amateurish & substandard that the film failed from frame one. Very few laughs and at times it was boring! The negative should be destroyed in fear of deterring anyone who hasn't watched the clever, well written, and hilarious series."
1,So very disappointing,"This movie was just plain bad. I wanted to like it SO much! There was none of the original series ""feel"" to it...the story was dumb...the characters didn't seem like themselves and it was all around lame. (let's not even go there with Daisy's replacement...BLAH!) I was very dissapointed in something I was very anxious to see. I almost wish I hadn't bought it...that way I could just pretend the series was done with season two and I could remember everyone as they were. Don't listen to the positive reviews...they are obviously written by people who weren't real fans of good writing and the original series. Seriously."
2,"okay, but it is lacking","I watched this and I have to say i'm pretty disappointed in what they put out. Everything that made the show great is gone. Daisy is played by someone different that does a horrible job. They should have just left the character out. Rube is also missing which was my favorite character. This greatly hurt the movie for me. Roxie is not mean or tough in this movie. Everyone else did a so so job. The mom was not pissed all the time and seemed happy with her life. This also changed the feeling of the movie. Basically everything is different. I don't know why they decided to make this if they were not going to keep the formula that was great. I read in another review that the only returning character that was good was the herbigs. He is right, they were good, but unfortunatly this does not save the movie."
2,Very odd attempt.,"I got the feeling that the writers didn't like the characters of Mason, Daisy, and Roxy. Why else would they write for them these lines and actions? The whole movie for these three characters seems pretty much only a set up for the finishing joke. I think it showed great lack of skill and care to toss the potential of these characters to write them that way. The tightness of the series is wholly lacking in this movie. No momentum, atmosphere, and style we came to love in the series can be found here. Overall, I feel this was a huge missed opportunity."
3,TV show was better,They should not have waited so long to do this movie. I did like the way it ended though. Some of the acting was really bad.
3,"Not as good as the series and one actor was replaced, the other was just missing...","Watch the series, it's well done...this movie is avg and pretty much an afterthought, as I wrote, the series was much better..."
1,Vomitously Bad,"As I fan of the series I was very excited to see it continued. I haven't been this disappointed by anything in a while (which would indicate my life is going ok, I suppose.).The plot made no sense and all the rules so carefully laid out in the TV series get broken with no consequences, hardly any comment, and no serious consideration. Daisy's character is turned from a nuanced and layered gem to a cheap, idiotic harlequin buffoon. No one should ever be forced to sit through this atrocity. Even trying NOT to hold this sh*t-stain of a film up to the high standards set by the series, I found no redeeming value."
2,Not all there...,"This movie was pretty weak over all.The big problem for me was (aside from the absence of Rube and the real Daisy) that there were two competing story lines, but there wasn't enough run time in the movie to really flesh either one out fully.It felt like watching a ""Cliff Notes"" version of what a DLM movie should be.It was nice to see the remaining cast again, but if this was intended as a series farewell, they failed completely. And if it was intended as a hook to bring the series back I'm afraid it's far too weak a movie to do that either.If you buy it do so as a completion of the series. Don't do it if you expect huge entertainment value from it."
2,Not worth the money,This movie is an insult to the show. The actress that played Daisy destroyed her character and the storyline was average at best. I would have stopped watching this movie after the first 15 minutes if it had been any other movie. Don't waste your money on this movie. If you are a die hard fan and need to see I suggest renting it instead.
2,disappointed,"It was good to see most of the characters back, but it soon becomes obvious that the writing is not the same. The ""spirit"" of the original series is forgotten as this new movie explores similar territory George has already challenged. The players behave and react in decidedly uncharacteristic ways to the new challenge put before them and the obscenity-laden language becomes distracting.Fans of the series may be compelled to see it for completeness, but will not be happy. Please rent.Not recommended for anyone new to the series."
1,Not worth watching,"First off, I have to state the obvious that true fans of the show will likely find this more irritating than closure to the magnificent series.The change in Daisy's character, as previously stated, is disappointing as she did not do a sufficient job and bringing out the true arrogance that is Daisy Adare.Aside from that, the entire premise of the movie is that George reveals her identity to her sister, which was clearly stated (and attempted) in the series previously. In addition, the idea of 'not taking the soul' was used already as well. This movie simply does not coincide with the show that I grew to love.I find it almost shameful that they attempted to make this, bringing almost no new content into it at all. If you liked the series, avoid the movie."
1,So glad I rented instead of purchased...,"I'm a huge fan of Bryan Fuller and loved the DLM series, watched it over and over and over. So, I was excited to see this film despite the fact that the Daisy character had been recast and Rube was gone. I did NOT realize that Bryan Fuller (the creative force behind the show) was not involved in this project.Because of that, the movie completely lacked the charm, dark wit, and poignancy that made the show so wonderful. It was a straight-up BUMMER.Rent it before you make the plunge - it may not be what you are hoping for! I'm really glad I didn't spend any money on it!"
2,You can't go home,"OK, I was a huge fan of the Showtime series and I was super excited when I read there was going to be a full length movie. Movie versions of TV shows are rarely as good as you remember, but I had high hopes for this project, since most of the original cast was reprising their roles, however this film is another example of should have let the show live in our memories and on DVD. Callum Blue as Mason was as deviantlly charming as ever and Jasmine Guy, as Roxie was perfect, but the rest of the cast seemed like they were sleep walking through a painful script, made even more painful by the absence of Mandy Patinkin. Of course I had to see it, and I guess half-hearted Dead Like Me is better than none at, but I secretly wish they would have left well enough alone. I say see it if you were a fan of the show, skip it and just get the series on DVD if you just want some great TV."
2,"Loved The Series ..... The Movie, Not So Much","The series Dead Like Me, had a genuine charm to it, it was funny and it was sad and it left me caring about the characters in it. I loved the series, the movie left me feeling like I'd been ripped off. Aside from the fact that it didn't have Rube in it and they changed the actress that played Daisy, the movie felt like something they just threw together to make some money off of people who missed the series. I wouldn't be in a rush to see another sequel."
1,Horrible disappointment,"A friend and I are big fans of the show and were excited about getting the movie. We invited another friend of ours who had never seen the show to come watch the movie with us. We sat there stunned at how awful this movie was, not just in general but also compared to the series. Why would they do this to such a great brand? The plot was awful, the actors were phoning in their roles, there was little or no character development - I mean it was awful.If you're a fan of the series, don't bother with this movie because you'll just be disappointed. If you're not a fan of the series, go rent the series instead of getting this movie. You won't be disappointed."
3,Dead Like Me: Life After Death,Dead Like Me: Life After DeathDead Like Me the Movie was ok. What I like was the interaction between George and Reggie (like same ones from the Showtime series). What I was disapponit about the movie is that the actress who was Daisy from the series was unavailable for the movie. Tis the pity.
4,Good end for this story...,"I missed Ruben and Laura Harrys but Ellen, Callum and Jasmine were great!!very good."
3,It's just not the series is all.,"I watched this knowing upfront it wasn't a continuation of the series. Can't really say I expected it to be the ""thing"" that get the original cast and series back on TV. So perhaps I liked it more than others not having any super expectations from it. Sure, I wish it had been the original cast and great story it once was, but it wasn't. If you liked the series as much as I did, you will rent or buy no matter what anyone says. Just enjoy it and don't set too high expectations."
1,Really disappointing,"I loved the TV series (especially the 2nd season). If you are a fan, please don't even bother seeing the movie. Bryan Fuller had nothing to do with it (and it shows). The story doesn't really go anywhere and revolves around a new character (no Mandy Patinkin, so no Rube). I don't really fault the actors, the story was horrible and horribly written. It did not feel like ""Dead Like Me"" at all."
4,Almost got it....,"I've got the full TV series. Never saw it in ""first run"", though - not on my cable. I saw a couple in syndication, and had to buy it....This one's just not quite up to it.... The new Daisy doesn't excite me at all, and Mandy Patinkin's ""Rube"" was almost worth the price of admission by itself. Some things in the movie are alluded to, and seem to happen without further explanation, things which Rube counseled his staff about.... If you don't know the ""story"", you'll miss 'em.Ellen and her ""mother"" and ""sister"" are still at their very best, and ""Reggie"" (can't remember her name) has really grown up beautifully. The ""older"" ""Millie"" is no longer a mouse, either.... (The rest of the ""old"" cast seem to be as good as ever.)Overall, maybe it's just because I've seen the original several times, but I don't care for too many of the changes.... Still, if you liked the series, and don't mind the changes being a little grating, why not?(Ellen is cute as a button, too, which doesn't hurt.)"
5,Loving being Dead again!,"I was a big fan of the series and I loved the movie!!! While some things have changed, I loved the concept of what would happen if they broke the rules. I missed Rube, but the reapers needed a chance to screw up without the father reaper there to pick up their mess. When George's reap didn't turn up, I thought maybe we were going to get a cameo from another Bryan Fuller creation. Overall, I thought it was awesome and I'm hoping for more Dead Like Me in the future!!"
1,THIS SUCKS,loved the series but HATE this movie....i can deal with it not having the pizzazz as the series but OMG..who in the world cast that chick as Daisy....she SUCKS!!!! royally....she brings down the whole show...it almost as painful as watching Maria Bello play Evy on the mummy 3......if you have a star that just killed a role and just cant be replaced then just don't bother....remove the character and replace it with a new one instead of casting these actresses that just ruin the show for everybody
1,Total Disappointment,"The whole story was weak and just made no sense. Mason was flat out dumb as a stick, not in the playful way he was throughout the first two seasons. The new Daisy was just awful, I don't get why she was walking and talking like a weirdo, she was obviously uncomfortable playing that role. The new boss, no character development for him, can't even remember his name. I actually got angry after watching this because it was a terrible way to close the series and I just felt like I wasted my time. The only parts I really liked were with Reggie and George but even that wasn't really developed and played out as it should've been. This really movie ruined the series..."
1,T.O.D. (whenever they decided to make this movie),"I've had a cold all week and decided to watch the two seasons back to back as well as the movie.Season goodMovie bad,badA total failure. The movie robbed the characters of the development they gained during the series.A 12-year-old writing fan fiction could have succeeded where this movie utterly failed.Actually I am going to stop writing. It would take up too much of my time to write about all the defects and shortcomings of this movie.Don't watch it, don't buy it.Good night"
1,Absolute rubbish!!!,Only gave it 1 star because the system doesn't allow you to nominate anything less! It doesn't deserve half a dead star.Really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 of this show. Just finished watching this follow-on movie and it's really got me riled up. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life! Absolute rubbish and an insult to a viewer's intelligence. Where do the maker's get off in substituting characters with other actresses (Daisy) and totally replacing Rube. I'd rather the show ended at season 2 than be left with this movie drivel. Wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their money buying this stupid movie.
1,Something good completely ruined,"I just finished watching the first two seasons of Dead Like Me and I enjoyed the series very much; however, don't expect this 'movie' to be the next installment of the series. I'll be honest - I didn't watch the entire thing...mainly because I couldn't since it was butchered. For starters, you can't replace a main character...Daisy Adair..and throw in somebody else who looks and acts very slightly like her. ...Then you can't just say that Rube is just gone (saw his lights) and throw in some new cheesy Europen-looking guy as the head honcho.... and even first thing say the waffle house burned down. These points alone destroyed the show a decent amount...2/5 main characters gone just like that. Besides that the show seemed to be written differently from the tv shows....characters acted very differently/strange etc.. Very disappointing... just shouldn't have made it."
2,"I loved the show, this movie, not so much.......","I really enjoyed the show, and I have both seasons on DVD. The dynamic found in the original cast was so strong and enjoyable to watch. However, this movie simply showed the gap left when key actors decided to chase other projects, and not participate in this movie. Oh yeah, I found, the substitution of a new actress to play ""Daisy"" was a VERY bad move, as the original actress brought subtle nuances to the role that could not be replaced by simply inserting another actress into the role.Heck, I could moan about how disappointed this movie left me all day, but that won't help anyone who is thinking of wasting their money on this dead dog (as I did). So, I'll just say this; ""Life after Death"" is a perfect candidate for a ""Netflix"" rental however, I found it a dismal, and disappointing purchase. My advice is rent this flick, if you disagree with me, go ahead and buy it. If you agree, then a simple ""Thanks"" would be appreciated."
1,A cartoon of its original self,"I was a huge fan of the original show, and was excited to see this. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I realized Mandy Patinkin was not going to be making an appearance, and this was the first of many flaws in this movie. It was poorly put together, and the characters we grew to know and love within the original show, were cheap imitations of themselves. Bottom line do not watch if you loved this show, what ever ""closure"" this might offer, it leaves you empty and with a bad taste in your mouth."
4,NEVER SAW TV SERIES REVIEW,"This review is by someone who has never seen the TV series, but enjoys a good indie style movie with an original idea. That is what I felt I was watching in this movie. Four grim reapers meet every morning for breakfast and get their daily soul assignment from their boss on a yellow sticky. One morning a new boss appears and goes high tech and gives out assignment via text messages. The four grim reapers live a duel life, one as a person and another as a reaper. The new boss allows the reapers to break rules. George, played by Ellen Muth (Denise Richards light) reveals herself to her sister when her sister's secret boyfriend dies, or nearly dies in a car crash. I enjoyed the unique story line, the dark comedy, and the personal aspect of the story. I am interested in watching the series. No nudity, one brief simulated sex scene, and the F-bomb gets dropped a few times."
1,Dead Like Me-Life After Death,"I wanted this movie to be wonderful...I loved the series and I was disappointed when it was cancelled. This movie was awful. The writing was uninspired and the acting couldn't save it. I am so sorry that this is the case...I know that the producers of this film had hoped to bring back the series if this movie was successful. I don't think that can happen though. Ellen has changed...her voice sounds like Candice Bergen's voice in Boston Legal. By my estimate, she is only 28 but she looks much older and sounds like a man. I am very disappointed!"
2,Where did the funny go?,"My husband and I were so dissapointed with the movie. It cleared up one storyline, but it wasn't well written. Where did the funny go? If you are a fan of the series - yes, watch the movie. Just go in with low expectations. It is nice to see the characters again - even though for some reason they set Daisy's character back to being super shallow."
4,"""Dead"" Lives Again","Fans of ""Dead Like Me"" will be both happy and somewhat disappointed. While it is a continuation of one of the best shows ever aired, One character (Rube) is gone, and the part of Daisy Adair is being played by a different actress. Of these two I think the substitution of Laura Harris by Sarah Wynter is perhaps the bigger disappointment. While a good actress, she just doesn't seem to capture the personality of Daisy Adair.As for the rest of the movie, it does put to rest some of the questions raised by the series and raises some new ones, so look for another DVD release, or (hopefully) a new series - with George as the new boss!"
1,Dead Like Me: Life After Death,"Not even close to the quality of the original show. Daisy is being played by a different actress who just can't pull it off. Mandy P is gone. I sorry. I wanted it to be good, but its not."
3,Meh.,"If you were not a fan of the series, don't waste your time. You won't like this movie.If you were a fan of the series, you'll find this film enjoyable. It is worth your time and money.If you were a hardcore fan, stay far, far away. You'll only be filled with disappointment over what was lost through the years. I can only imagine how much better this movie would have been if Brian Fuller were on board.My final rating? Meh."
3,a bit dissapointing but i don't regret buying it,"I absolutely LOVED the series and think its a crime that it ended. I bought this video more to send a message to bring back the series, but was excited to see most of the cast back. Rube was missed and his replacement and the plot were big dissapointments, but I love the rest of the charecters and do not regret watching"
5,very quick delivery,"The item was shipped almost immediately and I got it within the week - in perfect time to use it for Imbolc! Also, it was in perfect condition and beautiful. Thank you so much!"
4,Mike Oldfield - Tres Lunas,"Well, you have to be an Oldfield fan to appreciate his music, and I am one. From that point of view, I believe this is a good piece. I enjoyed it. His music is not ""ordinary"" New Age material. He's progressive."
3,A Good Base Knowledge,"After owning Weimaraners for several years, I decided to see what was out there that was being said about them. This book is a general good base knowledge of the breed. I think that it does encapsulate the disposition of a Weimaraner. However, it appears to focus on all the hard stuff and none of the satisfaction points from owning a dog of this breed. It is a good book for someone who has already gotten a pup or dog, but if you are looking for knowledge prior to purchase, it might scare you away."
2,"Great recorder, If I could get it to work.","I purchased this voice recorder to use to record school lectures and spend a considerable amount of time researching which recorder that I wanted. This recorder is compact, sleek, is MP3 compatible and has ample memory for my needs. However, I was unable to download my recordings onto my computer either through the Diasonic software or XP's device manager. Eventually the whole unit stopped working. Also, I had to take the batteries out even when it was off or they would be drained when I went to use them. The recording and microphone quality was excellent, but I could not queue forward or backward during playback. When I tried to contact customer service, I found that it is made from a company in Korea and I was unable to contact anyone to help me. It does come with a 1 year warranty, but it sure would be nice if you didn't have to use it. I definitely would never buy from this company again. I'm going with an Olympus."
3,Overall not bad,"I received a set of these as a gift and they matched my kitchen so well I bought a second set. The bowls and the chopsticks are perfect we use them all the time. The only negative is the placemats. The red dye on them comes off as soon as they get any mositure on them, even condensation from glasses."
3,"Beautiful, but....","This book no doubt makes a lovely addition to my coffee table. I feel so inspired and now.. how do I do it?? I was looking for more practical advice that addressed all my reasons for wanting to remodel green - protecting my family's health and our planet's natural resources and my financial savings. If the intention was to create a stunning, inspiring book - great job. If it was to really explain what green is and exactly how to do it, I think I'd look to books like ""Green Remodeling"" by Johnston and Master or read Environmental Building News...."
4,Affordable quantity and price,Good as expected. Good choice...Price affordable. and enough quantity for regular use daily.Is a good brand and great.
3,"Such a great start, but in the end, a disappointment..","I picked up this book because the cover looked appealing, and I was intrigued about what this book may be about. I started reading it, and I was really quite impressed. I was starting to get notions in my head about using this book for storytime at work or donating it to my elementary school, but kept reading and changed my mind.Rylant evokes a great sense of the wonderful in the ""ordinary"". Little thing which we so often take for granted. I loved that about this book. However, I was really put off about how she tried to tie that in with the child's own being. I didn't like how she made it sound like ""then one day, YOU happened"", (just like a flower blooming!) because there IS a great difference, in my eyes, in a child being born and a loaf of bread being made.It could have been really wonderful, but this analogy left me with a bad feeling in the end."
1,Don't buy this book!,"In fact, do not even bother to borrow this book from the library unless you feel your life is way too happy and you simply must have a depression going to feel alive!"
3,I am Waiting for the Unauthorized Bio Later This Year,"I have always loved Gene Wilder's work and have followed his career over the years. His memoir is entertaining and he is surprisingly honest about certain aspects of his private life, but I got the feeling that he was being selective in what he shared with the reader. There is an unauthorized Wilder biography being published around November of this year called ""Gene Wilder: Funny and Sad"" that supposedly is more analytical of Wilder's films and also reveals significant details about his personal life that he chose to omit from his own book. Wilder's book is good but I am waiting to read this other book which I feel will likely be more objective."
4,Good Reading,"This was a great book for an aspiring actor or actress. You not only get tips and first hand snip its of Gene as an actor and director, but a look at his life. After reading this book you feel like you kinda know Mr. Wilder or atleast can see what it is like starting out as an actor."
3,Not what I was hoping for....,"Honestly, I expected better from Gene Wilder. This book had its moments, surely, but it was so succinct and so glossed over that it didn't feel personal. Yes, he admits to many faults, but it seemed more a lengthy iMDB summary than a biography. Where's the drama? Where's the love? The personal aspects of Wilder's life seemed an afterthought and the book does not do Gene Wilder justice. Very unexpected, and mildly disappointing."
4,Kiss me like a stranger - Gene Wilder autobiography,"I've read a lot of actor & directors' autobiography, and they are all very different.I suspected Gene Wilder was a lot deeper of a person than the wild, funny persona we all know and love, and I was correct.This is a very interesting book, very truthful and personal, and I found it an enjoyable read, from start to finish.All the details of his childhood, how hard he worked at acting in obscurity from his teenage years on, to his triumphs and tragedies are all here.I highly recommend it."
5,Not a tell all... a feel all,"After hearing Gene Wilder discussed this book on The Diane Rehm show, I just had to get a copy. From the time I heard Gene's voice until well after I finished ""Kiss Me Like a Stranger"" I couldn't resist the beckoning of Gene's overwhelming optimism and creative energy.This book offers many insights to the mind of an incredible artist and his interactions with entertainment legends, however, this book is hardly a tell all.If you want the trash on Gene, Gilda, Mel Brooks or Zero Mostel, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a refreshingly honest and easy read that touches on topics of genuine heart break and one gentle soul's attempt to ascribe meaning to a lifetime of laughter and love... this book is for you."
5,Great read,I have always been a fan of Gene Wilder though I didn't know who he really was. I liked his honesty in telling his story.
2,PLEASE - is he narcissistic or what?,"Like many of the other reviews, I eagerly picked this book up to learn about the man behind the wonderful characters AND his relationship with Gilda. Yuck, too many details about his affairs and marriages in a most immature and self centered way. It was all about what his significant others could do for him. The writing was easy, but I'm glad I didn't pay for the book."
4,Wilder is still an enigma... but an interesting one.,"After reading this book, I still didn't feel I knew Gene Wilder any better than before. But I did think he had many anecdotes worth telling. I also felt strongly that he held a lot back - he seemed very full of anger and resentment at various points in the book, and he never really deals with several traumatic episodes early in life to the reader's satisfaction. Yet, it's still a compelling read and always captivates. A good autobiography, if not an illuminating one."
4,His Choice,"A published autobiography by a celebrity is a personal and risky endeavor. He/she will be criticized for saying too much or not saying enough to please individual readers.Mr. Wilder made a conscious choice to share what he did in a subtle and often very deep and moving manner. It was he, not a hired writer who penned the words not for the public as much as for his own reflection of a long, fulfilling, exciting and often troubled life. I heard the pain, the triumph, the humor but most of all the sincerity of his words. His narration convinced me of his brilliance as an actor which evolved years before his role as Leo Bloom in the ""Producers""I have to believe that this work has brought a sense of satisfaction and peace to Mr. Wilder.I'll think of him when I visit friends in Milwaukee, visit Mystic, Ct. where I lived in the late 70's and while seeing a play on Broadway as I recently did at the Helen Hayes Theater.This review is for the audio version."
3,Hearing him talk about the book was more fun than reading it,"I bought this book after hearing Gene Wilder on the radio, and found the book itself less compelling than the interview. I assume part of the blame since it's probably not right to expect people to reveal every detail of their lives simply because they are famous, but then again, if you are famous and you write a memior a certain amount of kiss and tell is expected. It does not have to compromise one's personal life, though. I would like to have known more, for instance, about the writing process for Young Frankenstein, the working relationship with Mel Brooks, how the actor's craft meshes with the screenwriter's, and how that all translates to what happens on the set. After reading this, I am not as well acquainted with Mr. Wilder's talents as I had hoped."
2,Worst autobiography I've ever read,"I suppose I should've known by the book's title that Wilder was playing his cards close to the chest when he wrote the book. It's mostly about his career. His disclosure about his life comes out in tidbits and, at times, feel inconsequential. There's a part where he mentions his dad died then goes on about his career like it was no more than a cold day. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because there were some interesting insights into working with Richard Pryor and Gilda Radner, but the book could've been much deeper. The guy has been a brilliant actor. But there are parts of his life he doesn't want to show the public, I get that, and if you're okay with that then read it. Otherwise, put it down."
4,"Honesty, funny and endearing.","A very easy read yet a very touching read. A true page flipper - like many true artists Gene demonstrates that he is also human and whilst many may not like what they hear he says what he feels.As a male searching for the answers of the heart and love, Gene demonstrates that we are not perfect and that all events happen for a purpose and that we can take comfort in the fact that may be fate does exist after all.A superb read."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I had high hopes for this book. I really like Gene Wilder, and was hoping for a more in-depth reflection on his life. Instead, I read a lot of prattle about acting techniques, his insecurities about women, and very brief chapters that stop just when I felt like it was about to get really interesting, particularly his younger years. It's a fact that people tend to lessen their own responsibility for unpleasant situations, but it really felt like a much younger person who hasn't gained the kind of wisdom we look for in a man Wilder's age. It was self-aggrandizing and overall not worth the short amount of time it took to read."
5,What I didn't know about Gene Wilder,"I'll keep it simple.Mr.Wilder tells the ups and downs about hislife.What a remarkable person,full of truth. Funny and sad."
4,A bit surprised!,Some of the experiences described were surprising. I didn't realize what awkward and terrible things Gene Wilder went through as a young man. Very witty and raw....enjoyed the book.
1,"The ABB are incredible, but pass on this one","This is from a 2 album run in the early 1980's that represents the only bad period of the ABB. A few of the songs would be good had they been recorded by the current band or an earlier addition, but 90% of these are embarrasingly bad. I do however like the song Brothers of the Road even though it isn't very much like the ABB (atleast it doesn't have the dreaded synth that actually appear on this album). But overall this is a real dud. If you are interested in something from their 1st reunion try the excellent Enlightened Rouges (1979). Or you can get something from their 1990s reunion years, all of which are top notch (4 or 5 stars each)."
5,"Rebuttle to ""God Awful"" Review","This is in response to the review titled ""God Awful"". Chris Conlon has every right to give a negative review. That is his opinion and we all know everyone has one. However, the comment, ""...since the singer is a white boy, he fails miserably."" displays his complete ignorance.The race card has no place in this review, and if he had done 1/10 of research before he spewed out his negativity, he would have discovered the singer is Peurto Rican.As for the quality of The Veil, I feel it is musically superb and Strength in Numbers efforts are recognized."
3,thoughts,"I agree with all the afore mentioned comments , having been an FMF Corpsmen, (62' - 65...HMM 262)... but as far the writing goes the book has many flaws. And the ""letters to Grandpa"" sort of smacks of PLATOON ..It is a self published book that could have used a good editor...Still i have great respect for the author and his courage..."
3,"Beautiful Bag, but not as functional","I bought this briefcase for my husband as a Christmas present. It's a beautiful bag and he was so pleased with it. He loves the strap and all the compartments. However, I read one review on here that stated it fit a MacBook, which is basically the whole reason I bought it. My husband has a MacBook Pro for work, but it doesn't fit in the briefcase very well. It's a VERY TIGHT fit and the laptop BARELY fits only in the very back compartment. He has to really stretch it open and finagle the laptop in. I was very sad to see this. I know leather stretches over time, so we are going to keep the briefcase because he loves it so much any way. But, I was very disappointed to see this happen with the MacBook Pro. Now that I examine the briefcase more, it is smaller than the other briefcase he had. I don't remember seeing measurements in the description. I will go back and check again."
4,Pretty nice bag,"Good price, nice bag. I ordered this bag and received it within 4 days! My only complaint is that the leather is not as smooth as it looks in the picture. It is nice leather, just more grainy than I thought it would be."
4,Except the clasps,Awesome bag for the money! Got it as a gift for my husband and he loves the quality and styling. Works for his MacBook. Only complaint is that the closures are hard to open and can be a hassle.
4,"Great Bag, but a VERY Strong Leather Odor","This is a very nice bag and is very well made. My only complaint is that it has the strongest odor of leather of any leather bag, shoe, or jacket I have ever owned. Even after almost two months of daily use, the bag's leather smell is so strong as to be overpowering in the car or other enclosed spaces.Add a star back to the bag if you like the smell of leather."
3,"Thought video would be nice, but a little creepy...","I also bought this through Sam's club, and have to say that the video quality is excellent, but there is a lot of audio interference, buzzing and clicking. So much so that I find by morning with the thing next to my head at night I have turned the volume down, and don't even know it. I at first thought the video would be a comfort over only having audio, but instead find myself waking periodically only to note tat the baby has not moved since I laid her down, or that she seems to be too still, and since she is not crying I want to go in and poke her just to be sure. If you are going to buy video I would buy one with excellent audio, so you can hear the baby breathing, otherwise video causes me way too much anxiety, and I can hardly hear on this one over the interference anyways."
1,not very good.....,"First off, don't buy this from the company listed. I bought the EXACT same unit from Sam's Club for $149.99.I brought it home and it does do exactly what it says, but the motor is really noisey (in the room and through the speaker on the handset).The camera piece is also huge. I mean there is no hiding this thing.The handset feels cheap and is all plastic. The screen is ok, but I really didn't see much color in it, even in fully lit room.Summary: Don't do it."
4,Helpful for more than just abusers,"It may seem strange that a woman would read and review this book but there is very good information in here for anyone touched by abuse. I even found it helpful as a mother of a son who is trying to raise her son to be able to express emotions, something that the book discusses as helpful. This book is very readable and practical. The advise on ""time-out"" is very helpful and is important for women in an abusive relationship to understand that when men walk away, it is probably a good thing. Chapter 6 on ""What Kind of Man am I"" is a great tool and Chapter 10 on ""Loving Relationships"" provides a nice positive alternative for building a healthy relationship, which is not something that is intuitive or obivous but can be learned! All in all, a very important book."
4,"Excellent design but it doesn't hold 75 feet of 5/8"" hose","This is an extremely durable, well-made hose reel. However, it doesn't quite hold 75 feet of 5/8"" hose as advertised -- when you get down to winding the last 10-15 feet, the hose will begin to rub the reel bracket, making it difficult or impossible to fully rewind. Consider the larger model if you need to store 75+ feet of hose. Also, it doesn't include a mounting kit or even so much as written advice as to what mounting screws will ideally support its weight. Unfortunately, you'll need to guess and find the right mounting screws or toggle-bolts on your own. Despite these short-comings, I still highly recommend this reel as it was by far the most well-engineered product I could find on the market (no leaks/drips as the connection points, either)."
4,My first read on this subject,"This was the first book I picked up at the library on the subject of homeschooling and it was powerful enough in its message to sell me on the idea. I was quite sure that this was how I would educate my son but I needed to have some of my big questions answered - and they were. The only thing that I didn't like about the book was the heavy negative tone that is taken when discussing ""the institution of shool"". I don't want to be a homeschooling parent who puts down the choice of other parents, I think it makes us homeshoolers look bad and besides more people will join us if they don't feel bullied. Anyways the book got me started on the right track and I am now excitedly reading many more books on the subject."
2,"Great, if you are unschooling","While the book does have lots of information and answers many questions, it is told pretty much entirely from a secular point of view. It is heavily supportive of the ""unschooling"" method of homeschooling, and beyond giving brief definitions of each, it barely mentions other methods. It is highly critical of using pre-packaged, or even structured, curricula. While not outright saying it, ""school-at-home"" homeschooling is painted as inferior, burdensome, overly restrictive, unnatural, and barely preferable over public school. I did, however, find the chapter concerning socialization to include helpful information and arguments to ease a parent's anxiety about how a homeschooled child can and does learn socialization."
5,Great Product!,"I love this product and have noticed a change since I started using it. I am on my second box and it does last a long time and I really do notice my skin looking younger since I began buying it. Its worth the money and I will continue to use it. It gives you a nice tingling feeling and what is great is after you apply both the creams, you can apply another moisturizer if you want and your skin is so soft with Dr Brandts--and really softer with another one over them. I sometimes put on one with a sunscreen over Dr Brandt's if I will be outside.I highly recommend!"
2,just ok,"although there is an intense void in the subject of trans and gender queer writings this book does little to fill it. there are occational glimering voices of truth and clarity most notably the essay by the transman with MS, but overall there was too much youthful exuberance and not enough thoughful, mature writing. i would much rather read a personal account of someone's reality than someone perched on a soapbox telling about how they live outside the gender binary. although i believe gender is something worth deconstructing, to not acknowledge that it exists in this world, or to say you live outside of it without giving examples of how you make this possible shows to me a lack of maturity on the part of the writer.I know mr. diamond to be a very prolific artist, but in this case i simply felt the quality was lacking."
3,This book was ok,"I bought just about all the books I could find on the FTM experience. This one was average for me, because I was looking for more than essays and poetry. It's still a good book."
3,"good, but not great","We got both these covers and Bummis SWW covers for our daughter as gifts. At first my husband and I liked these covers better, because it looked as though they were a better fit. They are a good fit and really soft, but NOT very durable. After a few times washing, it was clear to me these covers weren't as durable as the Bummis. The velcro began to become overly stick and the shape began to warp...and I wash the cover in cold water and line dry. The Bummi covers on the other hand look the same as the day we got them (except for a few stains, which happened with both covers). These covers are good, but if you plan on having more kids adn reusing covers, go for the more durable bummis.PS - I did wash the covers in cold water at first to make them last longer, but it's best to wash covers in hot water to disinfect. I started washing the Bummis in hot water (with my diapers) and they're still holding up fine."
4,Super Mom,"Debra Borden writes charmingly of life in Jersey suburbia. A 45-year-old woman with two teenagers who are growing up fast, this mom comes to terms with herself and her family by the end of the book. My favorite scenario occurs over Passover dinner when Julie, the protagonist, gives Viv the Heimlich maneuver. She is not satisfied there however and tries to do the same to others, leading her loving husband and son to give her a shirt emblazoned with the letters, ""HM"" for Heimlich Mom. This book is endearing and a fun read."
2,Lucky Me,"A fast, very predictable read. It was enjoyable but did not have any punch. The characters were, for me, without merit. The excerpt I read in a magazine, prior to buying the book was much more promising than the full read. Typical Jewish humor I guess, self absorbed and simple."
2,Lucky Me...I checked this book out from the library,"I did not enjoy this book at all and I generally like the ""stressed out mom dealing with changes"" theme in books. I couldn't develop sympathy for the mom over any of the things she was worked up about...panic attacks, daughter with a professor, teenage son having sex. It was sad her mother had cancer, but any part of the storyline related to that issue came part & parcel with very boring and tedious to read backstory.I noticed this book is featured in this month's Redbook magazine. This can only be the result of some excellent PR person."
5,Lucky Me,I loved it!!!!!!!! Laughed so hard I actually cried. Ms. Borden's descriptions of her childrens problems fit amazingly well with my own life. I simply can not wait for the next book... Watch out Danielle Steel you've got some serious competition now.
4,I loved this book,"I realy loved this book. I have read I have read all of Nylund's books and I think this book runs a close second to Pawns Dream. The people involved aren't your usual cookie cutter hero. Lary is human not a knight in shining armor riding out with the full intention of killing a dragon. It's a nice turn of the ""worm"" of the fiction novel. I highly recomed this book to any one who would like to take the time and read it. This book deserves to be savord not skimmed."
5,The biggest little book I've ever read,"There is more compressed into this novel than in any other fantasy I've ever read, and I've been a fan for forty years. Poul Anderson's sf novel The Boat of a Million Years covers as broad a span of history, but in three times the pages and half the complexity. Charles de Lint and Terri Windling have defined contemporary mythic fiction for me, but I was even more bowled over by this book than I was by The Little Country. For creatively dramatizing the complexities in the mythic war of good and evil, Nylund rivals Clive Barker.From the strength of his writing skill, imagery, and characterization, I believe I'll like Eric Nylund's other books too, although I don't expect the rest of them to be like this one; he does say that this is inspired by Roger Zelazny.I don't have space in my small room for keeping many books, but this is a keeper. It's worth hunting down a used copy. Hope that the publishers wise up and reprint it."
4,Bonus DVD track listing,Amazon fails to mention that this deluxe version contains a bonus DVD with two videos and 4 audio remixes:DVD track listing:01 Gabriel (Video)02 Sweet (Video)03 Trans Fatty Acid (Kruder & Dorfmeister Session Mix)04 Cottonwool (Fila Brazillia Mix)05 Sweet (Soulchild Radio Mix)06 Heaven (Funkstörung Mix)
3,don't like her voice,"I like electonica, but her cutesy voice and lack of vocal range bring the score down. Some of the songs are closer to club music than chill, with a heavy and unoriginal beat. Not sure what the appeal is."
1,bad,"I'll be honest with you. After a few seconds this album was removed from my stereo. Do not be duped by all of the 'essential trip-hop' titles that are placed on this act. As a whole this album is pathetically weak. Honestly, if you are looking to hear something amazing with elements of electronic music and everything else, showcasing a female voice, just go back into your collection and pull out everything you own by Bjork."
2,Depressing,"I discovered LAMB when I first heard 'Gabriel', a great song. So I decided to buy the album. I was hardly impressed. Its very depressing, and all the tracks are pale compared to Gabriel, my favourite track. Its frustrating to listen to, as there is some garbage Electronica in between the emotional moody songs. So you do need to skip often if you're not into that. Also, it sounds so much like the groups of that genre (Bjork,Potrishead,etc.) you hardly get the feeling you're listening to an original artist. If you have Gabriel through a comp CD, dont buy it!"
4,Imaginative and compelling,"I don't think every track on this record is perfect -- but the ones that are can be incredibly emotional and beautiful. I think ""Gabriel"" and ""Heaven"" both capture an amazingly romantic, dreamlike feel. I find this album very inspirational and listen to it often while writing."
3,Pretty but not very durable,"Praise The Lord: I bought this watch because it is truly a beautiful watch and it is in person as beautiful as in the pictures.I bought the watch because I thought it was beautiful and durable. I was only half right, I'm a professional mover, I move lots of furniture in a week so I can quickly tell what a watch is made of and this Invicta watch in little time revealed that it's strictly a dress watch.... a show piece and that's all.It does not stand up to much rough treatment, the three big buttons on the side of the watch are not well constructed.The little one on bottom fell off then the big button in the middle when to go look for his little brother and never came back either. Now I'm down to one out of three buttons on the side of the watch. The watch still functions as far as time is concerned but I'm done wearing it. I would recomend this watch however as solely a dress watch.Grace and Peace, God Bless all."
4,Hey....who turned out the lights?,"This is a great game- I really enjoyed it as I did the others. My main complaint is just that there is no light! I mean, thanks for the flares- but they only last about 5 seconds. The binoculars help- but the problem is that you constantly have to throw out your flares or put up your binoculars to pick things up. Why not just turn on some light? Well- perhaps you say- this is because she is raiding tombs after all. Probably not outfitted with lamps every where you go. To this I say- good point! It isn't so bad. I recommend this game- the graphics are incredible. I really enjoyed the motorcycle and the scenic views. Just play it in a completely dark room so you can see better. One word of warning- beware the giant scorpions- yikes!"
3,"Wow, how things have changed!",I bought TLR to complete my TR set for Playstation. WOW! Had I TOTALLY forgotten how different the controls for Lara are! I know I will enjoy working through this game as much as the others.
5,amusing but complicated,"This game is really fun, yet complicated. This game is definately one of the best tomb raiders yet. You spend most of the game in Africa, and you ride a truck and a motorcycle. Also if you get caught in a certain place you can do the level skip code found at many sites including http://www.gamesages.com . I would definately recomend this to any fan of the past Tomb Raider games (I own them all) You can also buy a Prima's Official Strategy Guide if you get caught. Well I enjoyed this game and hope you also get a chance to."
2,"Better, but not there yet there","The first Tomb Raider was a break through; all the sequils have only been popular because of hopes of getting the thrill and fun of the first. Eidos did better with this one, but it still lacks something. Perhaps the programmers of this game have just ran out of creative steam."
3,FUN game--Same Drama,"I enjoyed this game because its just a fun type--not excessive killing, but requires brainwork. I have played all previous versions and enjoyed them, but the game as I have read in other player reviews, and agree, has begun to become dry for me. Again, graphics, video cuts, etc. are all top of the line, but I think we need something new here--two player combined effort requiring teammate--something else, beyond enhanced anatomy and combinable weapons/items. Keep at it EIDOS."
2,More of the same,"Well, another Tomb Raider game and still EIDOS hasn't figured out a way to make this game as much fun as the first. Graphically superior, audio about the same but fun wise the original Tomb Raider still gets my vote. It seems as though the Tomb Raider series has been in decline since the first game. TR2 was o.k., TR3 was atrocious and quite boring. Last Revelation is a slight improvement but I'm really tired of pushing blocks and throwing levers. The first couple of levels are interesting because the training is no longer performed on the castle grounds. Do yourself a favor, rent the Last Revelation or play the original title. Hopefully this is the last edition in a series that is really begining to show its age."
1,TLR - Beating a dead horse.,"If you've already played Tomb Raider II and/or III, don't bother with this game. Aside from a few new tricks, this game adds little to its predecessors. In fact, its less challenging. After wasting my time playing this tedious game to the end I was almost glad to see the final scene."
1,Diehard TR fan says DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"ATTENTION: Most, if not all, of the reviews you have read are from people who have not played the last third of the game...the last third totally blows. Earlier in the game, there are some really innovative ideas, such as a level that takes place on a moving train, creatures that can only be killed by water, etc., but there is zero imagination once you get to the pyramids levels. The ending is not in the slightest bit challenging and is completely anticlimactic--there isn't even a final boss! Wait until TLR goes into the bargain bin along with the rest of series if you really need to play it. Otherwise, just buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater...tons more fun for your money..."
2,COBB had a GOOD SIDE,"TY COBB,THE GA PEACH WAS A COMPETIVE FIRE PLUG, BUT HE ALSO supported 36 ball players who could not survive without his help. He also established a hospital in Royston GA and set up college funds for kids to go to college who could not afford to. He really overcame alot of hardship while growing up AND THAT'S more than alot of can say. I got my info on Cobb from Al Stump's famous book on Cobb He is a hero to me in alot of ways."
4,James Bowman forever,"An article title about James Bowman said ""A singer in high places"" - and it's so true.James Bowman is a great singer, and one of my favourite performers. One can listen to his CDs over and over again, without tiring.He feels at home in both English songs and other languages. This CD is a ""summary"" of some other collection CDs of him.IN SHORT: Good buy for lovers of vocal music, or the baroque and classical. If you don't know his singing, you're missing a lot, and this CD is a great start."
4,"Great product, annoying shipping problems","I use this excellent product as part of my arsenal for growing vegetables year round in the tropics, where insects and diseases are rampant. It seems to work very well. My complaint is that the company (and Amazon) will not ship it to Puerto Rico, a part of the United States. To be fair, it is not alone in Amazon in treating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as if it were a foreign country. Many do. But I have complained many times and get no response. If any product can be shipped to Hawaii or Alaska, it should be able to be shipped to Puerto Rico. It is the same US Postal Service or the same UPS company. There are no import duties, etc. It is just very annoying--and an added expense--to ship to it an address on the mainland and then reship it to Puerto Rico."
5,Love these...,I use these balls in place of my dumbbells now. They make my workout more fun and interesting. Plus it comes with a workout poster so it showed me a couple new exercises that I can do.
5,Danskin Toning Balls,These balls are great! I love them. They're perfect for sculpting muscle. I use them with my workout(Walk Away the Pounds w/Leslie Sansone).
2,this poster has been censored,"I'm not reviewing the quality of the print, just the content. This image has been changed from the original, it has been censored, and poorly at that. Please take a close look at the pipe player at front right, the male dancer in front of him, and the man in red pants to the front left. Now do a search either on wikipedia or the Detroit Institute of Arts for The Wedding Dance by Bruegel the Elder. Likely you'll notice some differences. Good luck finding a poster of the real image."
2,the movie outshines the book,I read this recently after I saw Araki's film. The book hasn't aged well or something...it seems so weak and whiny compared to the boldness of the film. Small story and one we've heard b4.
1,Skip this would-be Dennis Cooper,"It's obvious this guy wants to be edgy and literary but you read the first few chapters and there's no thrill. Pretty obvious why Heim has only two books out while Dennis Cooper has over ten. If you like your writing to have bite, skip Mysterious Skin."
2,What a waste of time! Terrible!,I can't believe that I purchased this book! I hated it! I first heard about it at a bookstore and someone would say I'd love it but all it was about was being sexually abused and liking it. After reading I felt like I had to puke and so I did. I don't know why this book was published! It had no point! And the gay hustling scenes disgusted me! ... It was a waste of time!
4,Good read,Heartbreaking but still a great story. It thought the multiple points of view was an interesting way to tell the story.
4,Patience Pays Off,"There were a number of times while reading this book that I set it down, thinking that it wasn't something that I wanted to finish. Some of the situations are fairly disturbing, and the two main characters are so anguished in their own way that I found it a complete downer. But the writing is so skilled and beautiful that I pressed on, and it paid off big time. The story has haunted me, something that only the best of books can do. I now recommend this book among my favorites."
4,disturbing and sad. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,"I just finished reading Scott Heim's first novel. It was one of those books I just couldn't put down. I cared about the characters and found myself anxious to discover the outcome of the hideous deeds done to them. It sparked many internal discussions, such as the validity of ""alien abduction"" tales and repressed memories. I also enjoyed the open ending: Were the two main characters now going to have to tell others the secret they had managed to keep for so long? It's the sign of a great novel when it leaves you pondering the future of the fictional characters."
5,Works great,"This is what I needed for my Kayak's electronics. have no complaints works well, the only thing is that if your using it in a kayak think of a way to secure it so it does not bounce around when the waves pick up."
2,Wrong Item,I had this sent to me 3 times and all 3 times it was the wrong item. Not a gel cell. It was a lead battery.
2,Humminbird Battery & Charger Review,To my surprise the battery looks nothing like the picture. I thought it was going to be white with a blue trim(like the picture displays). The battery they sent me was black. It is a sleek battery but looks exactly and probably is the same battery that goes for $12.50. I am sure it is a good product and the Charger is pretty cool but for the price I would advise looking elsewhere.
5,This thing rocks.,"I put this in a cheap tool box and added a few 12V car cigarette outlets for power, solar panel charge controller, speakers from an old set of self powered computer speakers and on off switch. made a portable power unit that can be used with a 12V to AC adapter to power just about anything. Used it when the power went out in San Diego. Also use it when golfing, fishing and car trips. It can power cells phones, camcorders, cameras etc. You can also plug a mp3 player into the speakers for tunes.I like having a power supply in case the solar panels don't charge the battery all the way. Very cool!"
1,Build your own PAPER CUTOUT of a British locomotive.,"That is what the title of this book should read. I bought it thinking was a guide to finding or making parts to scratch build a real scale model locomotive. IT IS NOT!With that said, it gives a very brief history of trains, locomotive and how it works, carriges, tracks, bridges, signals, speed records, modern trains and a some very short train stories. All pertaining to British railways except the last page of the book that has a map of the USA and six famous train routes.This book is sutible for a child of about 6-10 years old. although an adult should help small children with the cutting out of the parts. The printing is large and easy to understand. Nice for a parent and child interaction (do people still do that?). For that, I would give it a five star rating."
2,Poor and incomplete,"While this book is good for a cursoury glance at the writing of John Knox it is too long to fulfill this function. The text itself is only a fragment of the true history and eliminates many of the more interesting parts of Knox's history.The original book is 5 (possibly 6) volumes, this edition only includes quick glances at each one and the last two volumes are introduced briefly. For anyone truly interested in seeing what the History of the Reformation is about this book is certainly not helpful."
3,"Good, but not the best","This product seemed to work, but I think some of the ingredients caused an allergy. I would recommend Joint Max hypoallerenic instead. I saw a dramatic change in my dog after I switched from this product to Joint Max!"
2,Dogs would not eat them.,This product has good ratings but my two dogs would not even look at them. I had to fool them into eating by breaking apart in their canned food.
1,Very Disappointed in Nutri-Vet,"My 12 year old Golden Retriever did very well under a different brand. Unfortunatley my local pet store stopped carrying the brand so I switched to NutriVet Level 3 Advanced Care for Dogs for his daily maintenance dose. Over time my dog's progress started to backslide. He got worse. I doubled the daily dose and he did improve, but not to the level under his previous brand. I just thought he was getting too old or his condition deteriorated beyond the help of supplements. I researched the issue and found an article about a ConsumerLab study on joint supplements for humans and dogs. The article stated that ConsumerLab's analysis of Nutri-Vet's Hip & Joint supplements hadn less than half the amount of glycosamine as stated on the lable, and less than one percent of the amount of chondroitin. I've put my dog on human supplements and he's improving rapidly."
4,House of Shirvanshir,"Ali Khan is a young man and a member of the house of Shirvanshir, a respectable family in Azerbaijan. He takes Nino, a Georgian girl as his wife, just when the country is under siege by Russian and Armenian forces. The story details his life and relationship. The most interesting aspect of the novel is how the writer Kurban Said (actually a Jew who embraced Islam) describes the world of cultural and religion so alien to the western mind. It's a time of extreme chaos for Ali Khan's people as the Azeri, a Turkic population, is faced with the destruction of their homeland. Another striking aspect is the portrayal of Armenians. For years Armenians have chosen to play the role of the innocent race, being subjected to the so-called genocide - however, they seem to ignore the fact that they allied themselves with the Russians and began slaughtering innocent Muslims in the first place. A very informing novel which has to be read."
4,A great discovering,"I don't think that many people have heard about this novel. I hadn't until recently, and it was first published in 1937. Anyway, this book is about a Muslim boy and a Christian girl who fall in love just prior to World War I. It's a powerful story about the strength of fate, and though it was a touch predictable, I was nonetheless very much caught up in its pages."
5,Authorship,"In Azerbaijan this novel has been attributed to Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli, prominent Azerbaijani writer and public figure whose works and life parallel the issues in the novel. By American scientists and literatures who investigated the archievs of Y.V.Chamanzaminli have been proved that the core of this novel was written by Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli. Lev Nussimbaum or Kurban Said plagiarized the authorship of this prominent novel."
3,Love Story?,"This was an interesting time piece, a snap-shot of a place and time that no longer exists. It gives you insight into the cultures, ethnic divisions and hatred that exists just as strongly today as it did in 1918."
4,"A ""must-read"" for all Americans following Sept. 11, 2001.","This novel presents cultural and historic conflict between Westerners and people of Central Asia in an understandable format. It is quicker reading that nonfiction, but does describe current and ancient beliefs among people in Central Asia and Europe. The cultural conflict depicted in the novel helps to illuminate the current strife in Afghanstan."
1,Utter perversion,This is an extremely perverted tale about a young playboy named Ali chasing around this hussy of a jezebel called Nino. I first found this book as I was looking for reading on the city of Baku. However this book fell short of all established benchmarks of literary merit.
4,A shining star among elegant ladies of song!,"One of my favorite things about Ethel Ennis is the sheer energy she put in to the songs she sang. Not available here, but on LPs are her versions of ""Joey, Joey-Joey"" and ""I've Got that Feeling (That Strange, Exciting Feeling"") which she also performed in a Scopitone. She also had the honor of singing the National Anthem at a presidential inauguration, which was something I never knew about her before! I'd have to put her in a Ketty Lester (""Love Letters"") category of elegant ladies of song if one was needed. But Ethel picked up the tempo quite well too. A particularly charming thing she did on high notes too was hit them as if someone had run up to her and literally squeezed her tightly. This is present at least in ""Still get a Thrill"". It makes her vocals very unique and special, IMO."
5,Really good fun!,I really am enjoying these mysteries and am so glad to still be able to find them in print form.The book was in like new condition and was shipped promptly.
3,test,"Provides a step-by-step guide to simple methods for verifying the identity of commonly-used pharmaceutical substances and dosage forms. The basic tests described can also be used to detect mislabeled, substandard products when the labeling or physical attributes give rise to doubt."
2,Disappointed!,"It looked great and I was really pleased when I got it. However, after the first use I found that there is no structure to the product. The back slides down as soon as you get in and tends to crumple towards one side or another. I guess it was my fault that I assumed there was some kind of plastic cording or wire that would help stabilize the ""seat"". If there was a tie that would hold the back up, that would have helped. I am very sorry for this purchase."
3,Not Up To Allman Brother Status But Pretty Worthwhile,"Dickey Betts is one taleneted guitarist and a pretty good vocalist as well. This solo release does have some fine moments. The closing track Bourgenvillia is one pretty tune with goregous guitar embellishments both from the lead and rhythm players. The other songs are pretty catchy. However, they all sound pretty a like. A couple of them even have the same opening riff. The drummers are OK but not as powerful as the Trucks/Jamoe tandem from the Allman Brothers. However as alight hearted and inexpensive additional to your collection, you will not be dissappointed."
4,Betts at his best,"After the early death of Duane Allman, Betts was the key to that great Allman Brothers sound.This Album exemplifies his playing, singing and writing ability of his genre. If someone ask to hear southern rock play The Allman Brothers and Dickey Betts.Only one question.....Why does the album cost more than the singles combined?"
1,Worst book ever written,"What a bunch of liberal garbage! Only bought it because it was a requirement for a class. Any book that has to be published by the author is suspect, why didn't a larger publisher print it? Waste of 15 dollars!"
5,Inspirational!,Mr. Chapman has obviously been in the trenches of healthcare leadership and clearly understands the issues and problems surrounding the delivery of loving care to patients. The insights and ideas found here are nothing short of groundbreaking. I highly recommend this work!
1,stupid book,"This book was required for a class I took, the book is unrealistic to the life of nursing in a hospital. The book repeats itself over and over using the same 3 examples as if being a patient is based on those 3 examples. This book taught me nothing about how to be a better nurse."
1,yucky,"This book was required for a literature class I took. It is full of stuff to do ""if"" you have the time. For people who don't work and do writing for their living, it might be interesting for you."
4,pretty good!,"I had this shipped APO and it arrived in about two weeks, which is about as good as it gets here. The glut-pep itself is working well for me. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle. I go through it pretty quickly working out as often as I do. Good product, good seller. Will buy again as soon as I'm low."
3,Not Her Best,"I love the Brunetti books, but this one just seems to miss the gondola, as it were. It's a mystery in which which Brunetti seems to be more of a spectator than the solving sleuth. Even Leon's usually amusing interchanges between Brunetti and his boss Patta lack spark here. About the only thing in which this book excels is Leon's descriptions of Venice. Armed with my map of the city, I follow all the action canal-by-canal, calle-by-calle. So, mainly for the travelogue I give it three stars. Donna Leon is a superstar in my book and I guess she is allowed to occasionally boot one. Hope her next book regains the artistry that her previous offerings do."
2,Expected More,"I was looking forward to blissfully soaking myself in a good old-fashioned cloak and dagger novel, but initially found this one a little tepid. More used to the rat-a-tat pace of the American crime caper, or the sinister undercurrents of the English countryside, it took me a while to get used to the well-read, genial hero of this Venetian mystery.Guido Brunnetti, devoted family man and lover of good food, is a far cry from the stereotypical hard-boiled, macho cop hero. The story is well written, with a thought-provoking plot that takes time to unravel.My main quibble is that our hero is reduced to being a frustrated witness when the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Neither he, nor the reader, has the satisfaction of declaring whole-heartedly, ""Case closed!"" Still, I think the series holds promise. Next time, I might try one of the better-reviewed books of Ms. Leon's like, ""Doctored Evidence"" or ""Uniform Justice"". Until then, Ciao Guido!"
1,The worst mystery,"If I could give this less than one star I would. In a word, ""boring"". This was my first Donna Leon book. I can't figure what she's getting at. The plot was very slow and there was a very sketchy resolution. She could have made it SO much more interesting by perhaps delving into the victim's life/persona and the Africa connection. Then there was the creepy description given by a witness towards the end which mentions ""hairy hands"". What up with that?? It was never mentioned again. I must be totally missing something here but I'm not inspired to pick up another Leon book."
4,Bellissimo for Guido,"Guido Brunetti is one of the most intriguing crime-solvers to capture my attention in years. He is filled with angst to rival Martha Grimes' Richard Jury. This one provoked a lot of thought about the treatment of Italy's version of illegal immigrants, had my mouth watering whenever he paused to eat fresh pasta with his wonderful family, and fleshed out the side characters a bit more."
2,Been there done it got the t-shirt,I am getting tired off these. I have read every single case - and it seems Donna Leon is running out of fresh ideas and new perspectives on Venice.
4,One of her best,"I think this is one of the best that Leon has written. Maybe I'm somewhat influenced by a recent trip back to Venice and lots of encounters with the ""vu cumpra"" (mostly Senegales who sell fake Gucci, Prada etc.). But it was a good read with a fairly complex plot that managed to tie together the murder, the locale and the good Commissario with international themes of terrorism and systemic corruption."
2,Worthy topic but poorly written and edited,"Poorly written, poorly edited (was it edited?) and painful reading, although the topic of the history of chemistry deserves exploration and could have been made much more interesting and accessible than it was here. The writer is an overly wordy name-dropper, writing over the heads of the average science person, failing to adequately explain identities, information, and uncommon terminology before moving on. Our college class finally gave up on this book and resorted to the use of another text."
4,Very good history book,"In short:This is the most engaging book of history of chemistry that I have ever read. It is technical sometimes, but if you have a good high school chemistry it will be OK."
1,Just plain annoying to use,"Works well, but takes way too long to set, and I end up using the old analog timer on top of my stove; just for simplicity. Very short review, but typed it up in less time than it would take for me to set this timer to count down for 5 minutes."
2,"Quick Setting Timer, it's not","This timer is not worth the money. Your muffins could burn before you can get this timer set. There is no fast way to set the timer if you only want to set it for minutes. You first have to activate it, then if you don't want to set the hour timer, you have to wait quite a few seconds before it to allows you to set the minutes. If you do set the hours, you still have to wait the five seconds or so to set the minutes. It is very annoying."
1,Simply awful timer!,"Like the other reviewers have said, it takes WAY TOO LONG to set this timer!! It's like watching grass grow. Seriously... This is my major complaint. It's heavy yes, but that doesn't bug me, it's at an angle yes, which is actually kind of nice. But due to its incredible slowness, every time I use it I curse KitchenAid for letting a bad design functionality get past what should have been caught in their quality control. Shame on them."
3,A love-hate relationship,"As another reviewer said, it is difficult to set this timer. You have to wait for the hour digit to blink 4 times before you can set the minutes. It needs a push button to toggle between hours, minutes and seconds.I do like the large rotary wheel as you can set the desired minutes easily by spinning the wheel; clockwise to increase and counter-clockwise to decrease. You won't have to press a button 45 times to get 45 minutes. When you are cooking and have messy hands, the wheel is great. No tiny fidgety buttons to press. The beep is very loud so you can hear it from a distance - great when you stepped outside the house.The ""D"" sized battery means long life. It lasted 3 years of daily use before I changed the battery."
2,Pain....,"I currently have this timer and I HATE it. I was always comaplaining I needed a timer, but never got around to actually buy one. For christmas 3-4 years ago my mom (who got sick of listening to me) bought me this timer. I was so happy that it was attractive as well as useful. But it is not as useful as it is attractive.It takes forever to set, you have to let it blink for 8 seconds through the hours then 8 second in the minutes and if you get distracted adding an ingredient while your waiting then you have to wait all over again, and DON't touch the dial or bump the timer while you wait because it will sometimes add 9 to the hours spot and I don't always notice and then you will wonder why the timer hasn't gone off yet.Mind you have put up with it for 3-4 years bacause it does work, but I just hate using it. So irritating. II am finally fed-up and buying a new timer."
2,Not Impressed,"Not the quality I expected from KitchenAid. This timer has several problems.1) It's difficult to set the time. There is only one minutes button which increases the minutes but not decreases. Miss your time and you have to start again or go around the clock.2) You have to hold the buttons down for FOUR seconds before they auto-repeat. Too long!3) It's not very loud, and the crappy non-alkaline battery that comes with it doesn't help matters. Dump it and put a better one in.4) The display occasionally gets corrupted and the unit hangs. At this point I have to remove/insert the battery.C'mon KitchenAid! You can do better than this... or can you?"
5,Heavy duty nifty timer,"If you read the other posts I have left for the Kitchen Aid Red series, you know I am a fan!! But this timer is really special- VERY unexpectedly (pleasantly so) heavy (1 D battery included), and the directions are fairly easy to follow. The only detractor is if you set it on top of your stove shelf, it is hard to see (the angle being a little off)!! If you leave it on your counter, it is a beautiful addition to your kitchen!!"
2,Kitchenaid can do better,"My kitchen is all Kitchenaid so of course I had to have this, but as other commenters said - they can do better. It's a pain to set, it's angle is awkward and you have to be right in front of it to see the display and at the right angle (I'm short). And the beep isn't that loud. There's no clock in it either. The metal band around the outer rim corroded too so it doesn't look nice anymore.I have a non-Kitchenaid timer that's got the clock, 2 timers, a button to set H/M/S seperately, and shows you how long it's been since you missed the beep that beeps for over a minute. I use this one more. (I think it's an older West Bend model)"
2,"Very ""quiet"" timer.....","A nice heavy timer, but even when I put it in the same room that I'm in, I usually do not hear the timer if there is any other sound going on - voices, TV, radio, etc. I've had two other timers - that eventually wore out from use - I rate this below average."
2,STUPID user interface,"The timer looks nice, and the setting ring is indeed made of nice heavy cast metal. But the way that you set it is STUPID: you start by twisting the ring. This wakes it up, and makes the HOUR numbers start flashing. Now you can set the HOURS. But how many times do you want to set a kitchen timer for more than an hour? To get to the minutes, you have wait five seconds for the SECONDS numbers to start flashing. NOW you can set it.Just as stupid: when you hit the RESET button, instead of resetting the timer back to whatever you originally set it to, it sets it to ZERO. So now you get the pleasure of going through the whole setting process again.You'd think it would be hard to goof up the user interface to something as simple as a kitchen timer. But they've succeeded, to the point where they need to print two paragraphs of instructions on the bottom.Get something else."
2,Not the most efficient gadget,"Positives are that it is a sturdy, heavy, good-looking, loud and easy to read timer. However, while it's easy enough to set, it takes sooo long to set it compared to cheaper, lower quality timers. You have to turn the dial or press either button, wait for the numbers to show, wait for the hours to blink, turn the wheel to the desired hours, wait for the minutes to blink and then turn the wheel to the desired minutes. Doesn't sound so bad but it takes a couple of seconds between each step before the numbers start blinking. As others reviewers stated, Kitchen Aid can do better."
3,:),"--Amy can't believe it - Jeanine knows that Amy is a clone! She can't figure out how she could have figured it out! Jeanine, being very cruel as usual, wants to use the information to blackmail Amy. However, Jeanine is fatally attacked before she can do anything with the information. It seems that Amy wasn't the only blackmailee of Jeanine - and someone got their horrible revenge! --I didn't like the amount of violence in this or in book #6, but it was OK otherwise."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This was an totaly cool book. If you like books that you're on the edge of your seat, and can't put down, than this is sooo for you. The way the book ends was a total surprise. One thing I really liked about this book is, Marilyn puts hooks at the end of each chapter which makes you want to keep going. I've read just about all these books and can't wait to read the next. Marilyn Kaye is a really great author!"
4,One of the best deep/tribal/soul house ALBUM of the year,"Osunlade has managed with something that very few House producers have succeeded with- to PRODUCE a coherent and forward-thinking house album that keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. It's house music at its best. He managed to create a sound collage that integrates African rhythms with Brazilian Bossa Nova and old school Chicago house. Even though this album is only available on import, I promise you it's worth the money. You will not regret the purchase of this album. Enjoy!!!!"
5,Uplifting and Incredible,"The first time I listened to this album I was honestly flawed, with amazement.Actually so flawed I couldn't even move.This is absolutely the dopest and the most incredible album in my book and in my crate of vinyls.Check out rader du, when this feeling, actually just buy it already."
1,"Drippy, dragging, over the hill, close up and go home music.","Dickey Betts has lost his shine completely. Only the first cut has any life to it, and his voice is worn out on all of them; sounds ridden hard and watered hot. This disc is as depressing as a hangover that you can play over and over again. Buy something else."
5,"Simply, the best movie ever made about the music business.","No drama, action, sex or sensationalism. Just an honest little film about the reality of the music business and the people in it. Forget the Hollywood interpretations of famous composers and show biz personalities. This movie tells it like it really is."
5,Jazz Films,"One of the best films made about jazz and the music business ever. Along with the fact that my older brother, Warren Vache, acts in the film and plays on the soundtrack. Sad that both Cleavon Little and Joe Silver have passed on. This film shows the true problems of musicians in the music business as well as the conflicts of amatuers and professionals. Those of us in the business can definitely relate.Warren did a great job of acting even though he had never acted before or since."
3,Only for those who must have every photo available of IB Singer,"The best thing about this short book is the photographic documentation of the imp that inhabited Singer. One can't exactly say that the photos show the twinkle in his eye, since in at least one ID photo, IB Singer wore dark sunglasses. There's a beautiful full spread color photo of his work room, about which Singer used to joke ""I can say I have accomplished vone thing in my life, my chaos has reached perfection."" (The quote is from Dvorah Telushkin's Singer biography). I didn't find the mini-essays particularly interesting, with the exception of Cynthia Ozick's."
1,Very Dangerous - Do Not Buy,"Just as the other reviews state this Toy is dangerous and falls apart VERY easily. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this. Literally less than 3 min of having this toy my 40 lb boxer puppy was breaking off little tiny peices of rubber and swallowing them. As soon as we saw the toy simply crumbling we grabbed it but it was too late. That night my pup was throwing up ALL NIGHT long little tiny pieces of rubber. This thing does not hold up under normal chewing so why its being advertised as a Strong, extra tough chew level is ridiculous and just dangerous, do NOT buy this one!"
1,Worste product to date!,As with the other reviews I wish I had read the reviews here before buying. This supposedly durable chew-bone took less the 3 minutes for my 20lb doxle to get chunks breaking off the end and swallowing little bits! I took it away from him immediately of course and fortunately he only managed to swallow a couple of very small pieces but a large chunk was nearly off and only missed being swallowed by a few seconds. BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY!! I wish I could give this negative stars!
4,Very durable & my dogs have no problem with it,"I'm very surprised to hear people having trouble with this product. I've bought half a dozen because it's the toughest thing I've found on the market & my dogs destroy the best of them (including Kong). Yes, they nibble off little bits, but they haven't had any trouble over it. You can make up your own mind but, whatever you do, don't think that this product is universally lousy. For me, it's been terrific. And--no--I'm not getting paid to write this review. Best to check to see if those panning it may be.Oh--to be honest, I've had little luck with the models shaped like a little tire. For some reason, the dogs just ignore those."
1,Very bad toy,One of the worst possible things you can buy. It is not tough at all and it can be pretty dangerous for your pet. A total waste of money.
1,WTF???,"First off... Elves? Plural? There's one Elf Vs. Grizzly Adams. A hilarious flick if you enjoy crappy movies. Horrible acting, and then the Evil Ugly Elf has relaciones with the hot blonde chick at the end. Be sure to pack plenty of ganja when viewing... you'll need it. Quite possibly the worst movie ever made!"
2,"""No, Willie. Gramps is a Nazi.""","After the local department store Santa is stabbed in the crotch...to death (!) by a Nazi elf ol' penniless Dan Haggerty takes the job but soon regrets his decision when he accidentally gets caught up with the girl who the elf is chasing.Why is a Nazi elf chasing the girl? Well it's cause she's the only virgin in town whose grandfather is also her father (!) and if the elf bangs this girl at midnight on Christmas Eve then their child will be the Antichrist! Wow. I seemed to have overlooked that passage in The Bible.Filmed on what looks to be $8,000 and directed with reckless abandon by Jeffrey Mandel - whose credits include CYBER-C.H.I.C. and FIREHEAD - ELVES still somehow kept me entertained and laughing (sometimes hard) for the entire 89 minutes. Watch it with a friend."
1,not so great AT ALL!,"I bought this as a bday gift for my sister. I'd wanted one of these before so I thought, why not give it as a gift and see the reviews first. When I went w her outside to apply it, only the middle section stuck down and the ends(the most important i'd say)kept rolling back up. The pad didn't come rolled up either. The product was just awful and left me very disappointed, looking like I gave a crappy bday gift; so I say, don't buy this one!"
1,This is a No-Sticky pad,"I bought this sticky pad and I should say I am disappointed for two reasons, one it does not stick on the dash board of either my car or my van (followed the instructions here...)and second my phones (iphone and htc evo) do not hold on well). Both are in their original casings."
4,"Works well, but a little too well for a naked iPhone 4S.","Works as advertised. It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard. Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad. Instead, it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone. I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover, but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all."
2,don't like it,Don't waste your money on this. I have tried to use it on the dashboard in various spots and on the console and it just doesn't work. It and the items still slide around. If I had the original packaging I would just send it back for a refund.
5,Works exactly as advertised!!,"Several people have written about how the edges curl up on the pad, which is absolutely true. However, this does not affect the performance of the pad whatsoever. And if you put an item on the edge, it flattens the pad automatically. I use it in both my cars to hold stuff like sunglasses, fastrack transmitter, cell phone, GPS, and everything stays glued to it like it is supposed to. My wife sometimes even puts her wallet on it and it holds it just fine. This is a great product and I'll be buying more for sure."
5,"Works just as described, prompt delivery","The title tells it all. This sticky pad, without being sticky to the touch or leaving a residue, has kept everything in place. I've thought about careening through a parking lot to see if I can dislodge items. Haven't tried it yet."
1,doesn't hold phone,"I have a Samsung Intercept. As soon as I received the item I opened it, read the instructions, cleaned my dashboard, stuck it to my dashboard, put my phone on it and the phone wasn't sticking, cleaned it according to the instructions, and the phone still wouldn't stick. I tried it both vertical and horizontal. This is only good for change I guess, not for the phones shown in picture."
2,Ends Curl Up,"I bought this to hold my Droid X. Make sure you put this item on a perfectly flat surface. I put it on the front dash of my CR-V which is slightly curved, and as a result the ends constantly roll up on this mat. Not worth it, get a stand instead."
3,Not bad,"It definitely holds items in place on my dashboard. However, over time the edges of the pad raise and won't stay stuck to the dashboard. I can fit my iPhone and glasses on it but that's about it."
2,It curls up,"Just like mentioned in other reviews, the pad curls up. I gate it 2 start because it does grip good. But the whole curling up is really annoying since it: 1) Allows dirt to get under the pad thus reducing the interval of time between washes. 2) Reduces space for putting objects. 3) looks bad!"
2,Not great...only ok,"I have an older Handstands sticky pad and I love it. This one is different.. not as cushioned and barely ""sticky"". I bought this for my husbands truck (he keeps trying to steal mine !) but he is disappointed in it. Hope they bring back the better version."
1,A total ripoff,"This thing curls up at the edges so that the wind from an open window can blow it off the dash. I cleaned the dash very well before putting it on and the edges will not lay flat. It looks bad and like I said it liable to blow off the dash. We have two other jell pads on our other vehicles and they work great, but this one is terrible."
2,Not meant for other surfaces,"I bought this pad to protect my phone while it rests on my desk at the office. I bought the HTC EVO, and since it has a protruding camera lens, I was concerned about it getting scratched from day in day out movement on my desk. I chose this one because it had good reviews, and was large in size ( the EVO is huge :) ).I cleaned my desk surface, and applied the pad. After only a couple of hours, the corners started peeling upward. It should also be noted, that the surface is actually sticky, which I don't really care for.I know this is intended for in car use, but seeing how it has difficulty adhering to a completely flat surface, I would have little confidence in this sticking to my car's dashboard.I have just ordered the iGrip XL instead, hopefully that is much better."
2,Doesnt stick - better off with a nano-grip,"Bought 2 of these, and placed them on my dashboard - they didnt stick at all - tried them in the wifes car, and they (sorta) worked there.I later bought 2 from www.nano-grip.com - and they actually worked as they were supposed to - so imo you are better off getting quality sticky pads at the get go, than buying some that dont work, and end up taking more time than if i had gotten the better one first"
2,didn't do what it was suppose to,"the ""sticky pad"" did not hold onto the dash board, especially in the cold weather. It was very dissapointing, especially considering I purchased 8 or more for gifts."
2,they don't stick.,Received from free sticky pads at a convention that worked great. Bought these expecting them to work better than the free ones. They dont stick to the dash board and the things you put on them dont stick to it.
3,"It's okay, but not the best","This Sticky Pad tend to curl at the edges, which makes it look very cheap on dashboards and other places."
1,not so good,i put it on my dash after wiping it down and drying it and went back out to it after about 20 minutes and all the edges were curled up
1,Damaged dashboard,"I did not get this product on Amazon, instead had received it as a free promotional item. That said, I experienced many of the problems other reviewers had with the mat rolling up at the corners and bubbling up. For a free promotional product, that did not bother me so much. However after several months of not using it, I decided to remove the mat. It left a big greasy mark on my dashboard (textured hard black plastic). No cleaning or car-interior-specific products (or solvents) have been able to remove the stain. I am posting this review as a warning to others...prolonged use can damage the finish of your dashboard!! If anybody else has had the same experience and managed to get the stain out, let me know what you did!"
2,Rope Snapped at Handle,I owned this rope previously and it lasted me at least 5 years. That BOA rope definitely had different material as it was hard to straighten out if I had it curled up in my bag. That original rope broke off at the handle so I took to Amazon to find a replacement.I ordered the rope and it was even better than the original. The weight was the same w/ the same great ability to whip it around at a fast pace. I could tell the material was different as it straightened out much easier than the original.Unfortunately it snapped at the handle again and I am beyond the 90 day return period (~5 months in). I am tempted to write it off as a fluke & order another one as I like the rope so much. I'm going to write to the company and see if they will honor a longer warranty period.
3,Great for those who eva teased their hair,"If you once enjoyed bands such as Skid Row, L.A Guns, Faster Pussycat, and others who fit in, you will love this CD. There is a wonderful ballad ""Sweet Summer Nights"" which anyone who recalls power ballads would enjoy. If you long for the rock you grew up on, give this CD a try."
1,Really BAD,I don't know how anyone good give this movie a five star review. Its really a 30 minute clip with a title the hints nudity. Well there is very little of it and what little there is isn't worth looking at and when they are wearing lingerie it looks gross and disgusting! I actually felt ill a couple of moments. If you are renting or watching this movie for the plot... please how are you kidding.
1,Worst Movie Ever,Horrible Movie; Don't waste your money or time to watch this movie. Absolutely no substance; Do yourself a favor and pick another movie
4,One of my favorite comic strips,"This strip grew on me gradually, but now, ""Mutts"" is one of the two or three comic strips I read daily. I look forward to the antics of Earl the dog, Mooch (a perfectly apt name for a cat, if you ask me), Ozzie, Shtinky Pudding and the gang to get me started every day. (Just thinking of the Fatty Snax Deli can crack me up.) I think ""Mutts"" is the best-drawn strip since Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes""; McDonnell has a fun, loopy style that reminds me of ""Krazy Kat"". I say ""Mutts!"" to you!"

5,"What a book, galsunno!","I am a florist currently working in Kaluville, CA. I was very interested in Germaniums and accidently picked up this book. I was amazed to read this book, though the subject matter was quite difficult to follow, I ended up just reading the pictures. They were pretty. I dont think i have learned anything about germaniums and didnt find anything about silicone implants but its great for the coffee table (its a bit bent)."
3,My ideal lower body workout,"I am really fond of Shannon Fable, I enjoyed her ""Balletone"" workouts, and now she has showed me another way to work hard my lower body by using the gliding discs.I strongly recommend this dvd, I assure you will feel you legs toned after a few times, because I already do."
1,DISAPPOINTED,Froom your description I thought I was getting the video and the pads you place on your feet.I only recieved the video. It really brings no value without the footpadsGoing to return
2,Not as described,"This set is described as 4-5/8"" diameter. It is not. The discs are only 4"" in diameter. Have not used them, returning them. However, I did notice one balancing hole in the top disc (didn't open the package to see the second one). This means they are not precision machined/ground. If you look at the CMT and other quality stabilizers, they do not need balancing holes because they are precision machined. Yes they are more expensive and for good reason. Also, the other brands are a full 5"" diameter."
2,The Mystery is trying to find the plot,"Note: I only read the first 1/3 of this book.The good points: it is clean, with no swearing and a main character whose prayers seem to flow naturally through her thoughts.The bad: After 78 pages, there is still no mystery. The characters are flat, unnatural (especially the teenagers), and there are far too many of them. Most of the characters are seniors, yet the reading level is about 3rd grade (according to my computer readability scale). There is no plot and nothing interesting has happened yet. It has an outdated writing style and feel to it, although it was published in 2001 and, I think, is supposed to take place at the same time.My understanding is that this series uses various authors, so maybe some of the books in the series are better, but I would not recommend this one."
3,Quality Is So-So - Wouldn't Buy Again,"I'm disappointed with this purchase. It was also fortunate that they made it here without breaking, as it wasn't packaged well. The handle of one broke the second day I had it. The top fits awkwardly and is somewhat of a pain to get fastened. The burner does burn well and for a long period of time and the seller is an honest seller, as she refunded an over-charge on my account. I definitely would NOT buy this again."
2,"Blasphemous, yeah, but poor writing a much larger sin","Don't get me wrong, I love Garth Ennis' work. His stint on Hellblazer was great, and Hitman and Preacher are seminal works. I just don't believe that Garth hit his stride until Preacher came along, and the proof is here in True Faith. Although the story has elements that would appear later in Preacher (and other Ennis works) the story is very poorly written. The dialogue is terrible, and the story just sort of putters out in the end. Some scenes, like the protagonists brain-dead family's conversations, are a little funny but don't really seem to work. Yeah, it's blasphemous, but the writing is a far more worse sin. For Ennis completists only."
5,Tarheelers Just Don't Know...,"It's apparent that those who have the 1-star ratings for this video are not Duke fans (and even some admit it). So, if you're not a Duke fan- why watch it? And then blast it with negative reviews? But for those of us who are true blue, this video is a MUST HAVE. Watch it once and you'll wanna watch it twice to see the fascinating history that you may have missed the first time. It's packed with outstanding footage of games from the beginning of the Blue Devil legacy, to the initiation of the Duke vs UNC rivalry and up into Coach K's fantastic leadership of the team."
1,terrible,"To be fair, perhaps we should add to the previous review the famous biologist G.M.Smith's appreciation of this book: ""Everything contained herein is WRONG""."
5,The Best,I have owned a copy of this on vinyl since it was originally released. Chet's version of Jingle Bell Rock was used for background on all the radio advertisements during that period at Christmas time. Even today this song is widely played around the holidays. With the inclusion of the Anita Kerr singers this is easily the best Christmas Album of all time.
4,"great content, but what happened to the cover?","Great Holiday music on this album that merits five stars. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the original LP had a great cover of a guitar superimposed over a winter woodland. What happened to the cover? Someone at the recrod company did the customer a disservice by not using that great artwork. For lack of the cover, I have to give the whole package 4 stars."
2,"absolutely right, chet deserves better","the reviewer who states this album is mastered wrong is right!There are noticible ""wobbles"" in the sound, otherwisethe playing of Chet is great, he plays solo classical on the songs at the end of CD which is real nice."
2,Much Better CD available Fall 2012,"Check out this CD released September 4, 2012: ""Songs for Christmas"" by Chet Atkins, an import CD.This import is the ORIGINAL 1961 Christmas album (RCA Victor LSP-2423) - the album with the red Gretsch in the snow on the cover. It is not the 1970's(?) rerelease on which Chet played his Del Vecchio on several songs. The Razor/Tie CD is the 1970's rerelease.The remastering on this import seems well done, at least to this tin ear.IMHO the original LP is one of the finest Christmas albums RCA ever sold and one of Chet's most beautiful."
4,Maslow se traduce y se entiende.,"El Dr. Wayne Dyer presenta una extraordinaria versión acerca de varias reflexiones realizadas por el Dr. Abraham Maslow. Su mayor talento fue ""traducir"" a un lenguaje más accesible lo que Maslow refiere muy científicamente. Además, Wayne Dyer tiene el talento para atraparnos como lectores y enseñarnos que las diferentes etapas de la vida no se sustituyen una a la otra, sino que se complementan. Nos ayuda a vivir el momento presente sin límites en nuestro futuro."
5,High quality... worth the price.,"Mine came with a plastic cover to preserve the cutting edge.I use it every day and it gets thrown in the dishwasher every day; I've had it about a year.I threw away my old Kitchenaid plastic-handled piece of junk, and even a hand-me-down Pampered Chef, and this works better than my parents' 8-16 piece apple cutter. This one is very nicely made. I didn't realize there could be such a huge difference in designs of such a simple object!THIS IS A WINNER. I'm looking for other Rosle products."
2,didn't suit my needs,"This product is slightly small - some of the apples I purchased wouldn't fit. In addition, the circumference of the core that is cut out by the device is extremely small. Thus, seeds are left over in the apple slices. I'm returning mine. I'll either try the oxo steel product or use a knife."
5,Good Value Level,"I've had several mid-priced levels in my time and for the money, this one is hands down the most accurate and well built of the bunch. I would classify this as more of a contractor's grade level versus something the average DIY'er would purchase. The price was so good I couldn't pass it up and after receiving it, I'm not sorry I ordered it. This level will soon become my go to level anytime I need to check my projects for accuracy. If you want a more hi-end product spend the money on a Stabila. If you're like me, and more of a weekend warrior, this level will do anything and everything you will ever need."
1,OK but could be better,If you want a pain lavel this is it. A long slick with a few viles and bubbles.You could buy better. Try the True Blue guys
4,stratch pages for planner,Nice to have a place in my planner to jot down some notes. Nice line spacing and reasonable in price.
3,Nice Album between Rap and R'n'B,"Cunnie Williams offers a good mix of Rapmusic, which is where his style of singing and rhyming comes from, and R'n'B in a Boyz 2 Men tradition. Loans from R'n'B intrumentation sweeten up the Rap tunes. The lyrics are sometimes witty, sometimes predictable. All in all a good album that offers a variety of shades of Rapmusic.Nothing spectacular though, which is why I only give three stars."
1,Ultimate Big Disappointment,"The CD requires an installation to print.The installation then requires a registration.The regular registration doesn't work even though the software says it was successful.Next you can go to the next level and do ""online"" registration which doesn't work either even though once again the software says it was successful.Contacted (emailed) customer support. No reply.This is nonfunctioning crap without support!!"
5,Great,This is so helpful in making sure the notes you play aren't off and what the song is supposed to sound like for songs you haven't heard a thousand times. Very good product for beginner guitar players.
4,Sickness won't hold you back,"This story invovles Easter and what kids get on Easter....or will they? I think this story was very creative. Wilbur gets sick on Easter Eve. This makes everything much harder for the Easter bunny. Others try to do what he does, but they can't. Wilbur is a very big bunny, and that is why he's chosen as the Easter bunny. The story involved some suspense at parts. I like how his friends distracted everyone from seeing Wilbur. Wilbur ended up getting sick on Easter Eve. That made for a very interesting delivery of eggs. I thought it was a good book. I would recommend it to kids to read."
3,Great board- crappy packing,"I really like the Kitchen Aid Red series, and bought this to round it out. I love the board- but the packing consisted of two pieces of paper on either side stuck to the board with something like crazy glue. I still cannot get the crazy glue off- I am going to try some Goof Off and see if that works. (I did go back and by the larger board, I liked this one so much)."
5,Studan,"This record is addictive. Get used to seeing the name ""Rogue Wave"" around. And, they are a must see ""live"". This is apparent after they've played with The Shins, The Clientele, Super Furry Animals, Spoon, Yo La Tengo and now AC Newman. You gotta seem them live if you like good music. Zach Rogue plays most of the instruments on this CD! Ya gotta get this record. Geez."
4,Where Have I Heard this Before?,"Rogue Wave are just like the Shins. On this album, about half of the songs are eerily familiar, as they sound like they were made by James Mercer and company. That's not a bad thing, as the songs on this album are, on the whole, lovely pop songs. However, the songs don't remain too memorable as the ones on Chutes Too Narrow or even Oh, Inverted World, which is why this album gets 4 stars (that, and the lack of originality).The best song on the album is ""Endless Shovel,"" which features some great guitar work and is also the least Shinslike song on the album. I hope that this is a sign that this good band can build on this promise and not only make other great pop records, but also ones that have more of a defining character to them."
5,A True Anerican Hero!,"Great book for anyone who want to know the daily work of a cop who cares and takes a stand in the inner city of Flint. This book is a real eye-opener and allows us to see another world that is hidden within our world. Great book for a humanities class. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how one cop's soul touches the lives in his community. This man was the first person in Flint to receive the President's Volunteer Service Award. If people in America took a stand like Mr. Willigham did, our country would be a true utopian society."
2,NOT a sport sunscreen,"I used this product at an athletic tournament on a mildly sunny day in August. Contrary to its label it did sweat off, it did run in my eyes and I did get sunburned. I reapplied multiple times but apparently that was not enough. Poor product."
1,better to donate your money to charity,"Look, Sid was a loser, drug addict, killer & did not even play on Never Mind the Bollocks. Why are you looking to buy this?In the 1970's, this was a goof! You had the scummiest singer singing a classic crooner's song, ""My way"". While it is interesting it does not mean that it was good.Its just a bunch of cover songs sung by a total, talentless loser. He wasn't good enough to play with the Sex Pistols so he shouldn't be good enough to be in your cd player.If you like scummy, gross, junkie type people that have actual talent try Johhny Thunders ""So Alone"". He would have taken Sid in a junkie/ loser death match."
1,Grim and hopeless,"What a true disaster this release is, was, and always has been. There is absolutely nothing about this cd to recommend to anyone except the most fanatical punk completists. There isn't even any real connection to his Sex Pistols days to be found amid all the woefully performed and awful- sounding crud on here. So if you are a Sex Pistols fan because of the messages behind their original music, you can safely skip this and not feel as though you've missed anything. Because you haven't..."
1,I've had my fill ..uggh....,"Sid couldn't play and instrument, couldn't carry a tune in a bucket and evidently could barely enunciate. That being said I have never heard a better version of ""My Way"". Unfortunately a good version of anything is no where to be found here. All the material on this CD must have been recorded on equipment entirely made of wood. Quality Sid would no doubt have given his nod of approval to."
2,RIP Sidney,"Sorry, folks, but in their unbridled haste to flood the market with Pistols material, the powers that be unwisely elected to market ""Sid Sings"", which proves to be their undoing.Buoyed by the success of Sid's covers ""My Way""(Sinatra), ""Something Else""(Cochrane), as well as ""No One Is Innocent"" (featuring Ronnie Biggs), they realized the posthumous Sid market might be hungering for more. So they got ahold of this weak, poorly recorded NY club date and voila! The solo album that never was.Even with the late great Jerry Nolan on drums, there's nothing driving about this collection of Sid doing karaoke, and certainly nothing amusing. For completists only."
5,Sid Sings,"This shows Sid at his best. The sound quality may be below average, but that doesn't matter. It's still an awesome album. Here is how I rate each song.1. Born To Lose (8/10)2. I Wanna Be Your Dog (9/10)3. Take A Chance On Me (9/10)4. Stepping Stone (10/10)5. My Way (10/10)6. Belsen (10/10)7. Something Else (8/10)8. Chatterbox (8/10)9. Search & Destroy (9/10)10. Chinese Rocks (8/10)11. I Killed The Cat (9/10)The only thing missing from this album is 'C'mon Everybody', which is another one of Sid's Eddie Cochrane covers. Overall I rate this album a 10 out of 10. ROCK ON SID!!!!!!"
4,Sid!,"True,Sid wasn't anything but a ""Coat hanger"" when he was with the Sex Pistols.Yes,people say he's a talentless junky.Well,I like his voice and I think he did great on the cover songs (especially for a junkie)"
3,"The Man of ""STEAL.""","This album is a great example of Good Ol' Sid rippin' off of fellow rock & rollers like Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakes and The stooges. In ""Sid Sings,"" The Rock and Roll Swindler proves his ability to sound good at sounding bad and I mean that in a good way."
3,Goodbye All You Punks,"The album, released about 10 months after Sid died, was viewed then as either a means for a crass record company to cash in on yet another dead rocker or a fitting tribute to what some believed as the death of punk.There is one live recording - Born to Lose - from a Sex Pistols concert in late 1977, with other live material culled from two 1978 gigs at Max's Kansas City. The most interesting cut is a rough recording of My Way, which was remixed and released as a single for The Great Rock-n-Roll Swindle.From his early beginnings as a drummer for Siouxse & the Banshees to playing bass the Sex Pistols, Sid was more the style and swagger to British punk. And those are the reasons Sid Vicious remains alive today for so many fans of the punk movement."
2,WHAT A WASTE !!!,"I can understand that some people gAve this album a good rating out of their fanaticism for the mighty Sex Pistols and their devotion for the icon (Sid).I even like the way Sid sings (though I never tolerated he could NOT play bass at all !!! ).But the band playing in this record is a rippoff !!!.They play their instruments just as bad as Sid does !!!.On top of it all this is a sh..tty live,covers,ill sounding record.I sold my uk import copy for four bucks !!!SID GIMME A BREAK CHAP !!!!!"
2,"Strong, but not strong enough","Considering the company he keeps (Roni Size, Reprazent, DJ Die), you'd think that the debut album from Krust would be a monster album that stomps through your brain with beats the speed of light and sounds that make fingernails on a chalkboard sound like a symphony orchestra.Well, we'll see what he does next time around.Simply put, the tracks on this CD are uneven. There's some strong drum-n-bass (butnothing you've not heard before) with vocals lopped onto them that, for the most part, get in the way...and on WAY too many tracks. Then there's the errant down-tempo ditty and the occassional symphonic strain, which, frankly, I would have liked on a CD I MEANT to hear classical refrains on. The title track, however, completely rocks and Saul Williams' spoken word really sticks out on this track wonderfully.But just the beats and quickly, please."
4,A pedestrian's opinion,"I don't usually listen to D&B, so consider this the opinion of an outsider who bought this only because he liked Roni Size's ""New Forms"". I don't know how original these songs (and sounds) are, but I liked them nonetheless. The music ranges from typical D&B (High plains, Tribute,...), to James Bond-like music (Overture), to a cello solo (One moment), to a slam declamation by poet Saul Williams. It seems that Krust takes here more risks than when he is with Roni Size, and I can understand why more than one ""purist"" is unhappy about this CD. I agree that not all the vocal pieces are good (Re-arrange and Excuses are forgettable). But the title song ""Coded Language"" is worth the price of the CD: it's exhilarating, powerful and unstoppable. Saul Williams is an inner city Walt Whitman, and its lyrics fit perfectly with Krust's grooves. Check out his movie ""Slam"" and the CD ""she"" if you liked him."
2,Are you kidding me?!?,"I just received this item as a gift, so I can't attest to its durability. I will tell you this, though....get ready for the fight of a life, just to use this cutting board. Kitchenaid, a company manufacturing products for food preparation use, has stumbled upon the most chemically-impervious substance in the known universe, and used it to attach their labels to this item - not just on 1 side, but on BOTH. After attempting to remove the glue residue with lighter fluid then nail polish remover, and ruining a brand new sponge trying to power through it, I think it's ALMOST gone.Congrats, Kitchenaid, on your discovery. Now just try keeping it off of your products!"
4,Wow this thing has everything,Tons of first aid in this package --- I was surprised at how inexpensive it was!
2,"Too Big, Filled with Junk","When I ordered this, I thought it would be a relatively small First Aid kit packed with essentials for emergencies. I was surprised when it arrived. It is a big, grab-and-lift kind of kit, full of over-the-counter skin creams, some band-aids, a cheap pair of scissors, aspirin... etc... of very little use in a genuine, serious emergency.You'll do better, and be better prepared, assembling your own kit using your own common sense."
4,love it!,I purchased this product for our company of 25 employees. It has everything we need and has a good supply for an emergency kit for our main branch.
4,great kits for the Price.,Great Kit for the house or OfficeGood quality supplies and very nice carrying caseonly $20 at SAMs club.
3,a lot of mediocre stuff,"This is a medium to somewhat less than medium quality kit. There are a large number of items, but the quality of the case is poor, the quality of the instruments is mediocre, and overall I was not pleased when I received it. When I opened it up, much of the contents fell out. So, I glued the plastic insert in the case to hold it together. You must open it at a 45 degree angle to keep the contents inside. Bummer. The printing on the case is cheap, as is the case. It does not fit together well enough to keep water out. Spend more money and get something better, or the same amount and something smaller but better quality. Just my opinion."
3,Stroll On: the chuck willis collection,i been tryin to find stroll on the chuck willis collection i would like to know if this title has the same list of songs as Stroll On does? can someone E-mail me with the titles to this CD
1,Not what it seems.,"This DVD looks great but don't let it fool you. First of all, both shows were in Chinese. The DVD ""Language"" section says it is in English but it's not. There are English subtitles, but I like to watch a movie, not read it. ""The Invincible Fighter"" sounds like it is a documentary about the life of Jackie Chan. Instead it is clips from his early movies. The show ""Jackie Chan's Crime Force"" doesn't even have Jackie Chan in it. Well, maybe it does at the end... I kept it on for about an hour and when he didn't come on, and I got fed up with ""reading"" my movie, I turned it off. If you speak Chinese, and aren't a Jackie Chan fan, this DVD might just entertain you. But I doubt it."
3,fine for a beginner,I couldn't get my heart rate up at all with this one. I think it would be good for someone who hasn't worked out for as many years as I have. I also got a bit tired of her telling me how excited she was.
5,Essential.,"Let me be frank. I'm a high school dropout and I've had this book for a long time. I'm not going anywhere right now. I'm nineteen years old. I have read nearly one-hundred different study books and motivational books and I can honestly say that if there were one that was going to get me on the right track, it would have been Walter Pauk's How to Study in College. He gives great information in common sense context and backed by complete, legitimate research. The book is not even solely about studying in college, it's about developing yourself into an educated person.Parents, this book would make a great gift for a troubled child. If he/she has any intelligence whatsoever, he/she will read it without much encouragement. This book is worth it's weight in gold."
3,Warning,"My warning to young students buying this book is quite simple. Don't turn to this book hoping to find answers that you cannot find on your own. This book offers some great advice, but like all self help books, good advice isn't always that easy to put into practice (nor is it always needed). First year of University can be a very intimidating time, don't buy this book out of fear like I once did. Find your own courage, your own inner strength and don't take this book too seriously, because at the end of the day you need to find what works for you."
3,Worthy primer,"This is one of the very first books on ""End Times"" I bought when I began studying this subject seriously. David Pawson covers a lot of territory in an easy readable fashion.Because he deals with a large number of subjects in a relatively small book (269 pages), he is also constrained in how in-depth his treatment of each topic is.Unfortunately, his coverage of Dispensational Pre-Millennialism and the pretribulational rapture is both superficial and poorly argued. The fact that he mentions Darby, MacDonald and MacPherson in two paragraphs (p 177) demonstrates that there was no research done in this area and that his posttribulationism biased his points.Apart from this, I recommend the book as an entry level primer to gain a broad view of the subject of eschatology."
2,Not my favorite soap ever,"This is definitely not my favorite soap. I found it to be drying and a bit rough. I much prefer and recommend the olive oil soap by Kiss My Face. By the way, I heat the soap up a bit in the microwave and cut it into smaller pieces which are easier to use and work better."
5,no wonder a James Ellroy Rampart movie is in production,"I'd caught a few random episodes but this season's opener was the one which decided me to get into it properly. By now the lead characters are turning on each other so viciously that offering protection to Armenian gangsters seems an easy way out. The fetid locations make me think that choosing your freeway exit in LA must be like Russian roulette. Makes me believe that this is how bent cops work, this is why the system needs them. (BTW you can find the Rampart movie in IMDB.)"
5,One of the best,Michael Chiclis and Walter Googins are magnificent and this is one of the best shows ever. I highly recommendThis series to anyone who likes gritty TV.
5,The Shield - The Complete Sixth Season: A great buy!,"This product is a great buy, but only for the true Shield enthusiast. The events that unfold are inextricably linked with the past seasons, making it one of the most dramatic seasons yet. Thus if you are in no hurry to own The Shield and can wait for a box set collection to come out after the end of this year's final season (7), you may want to purchase that. I had to order all 6 seasons individually off of here, and I promise a box set would look unbelievably on the mantel. However, if you're squared away with the past seasons, I say spend the money and buckle up for some intense TV."
2,The Shield Season Six,"The quality, delivery etc. was great as usual. It was a bit disappointing that the season was so short and still cost the same price as other seasons that were much longer."
1,Terrible Ending,"Season 6 is a slap in the face for those who faithfully followed this series for 5 years.Something happens to screenwriters when they have to write those last 3 episodes -- they stop being creative and want to simply take the money and run. They write crap.This ending is even worse than The Sopranos ending -- would you believe it? They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used, at a great price, and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons, and the characters, do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6. They are stealing money from you under false pretenses."
1,what a joke,i ordered this dvd nov 28 got it a month later i was fine with that then i get it and its opened i ordered it brand new from amazon and the case was busted the dvd not even in the case what a joke then they charge 11$ to ship it to canada and it cost them 1$ what a rip off never dealing with amazing again i can go to bestbuy futures hop walmart get the same stuff way cheaperI LOVE THIS SHOW 5 STARS FOR THE SHOW 9 STARS FOR AMAZON
5,I have the entire series.,"The series, it's a keeper. So much goes on watching the series over you notice more details each time."
4,Tony's second go-round!,"Being this is my second DVD of the shield, due to the defective first copy and I am very pleased so far with the handling of this problem. This copy is exactly like the bio said and more. It's in very good condition and I would not hesitate to buy in the future, from this shipper. Thanks."
5,the shield 5th season,THE SHIELDPurchased on 03/13/2009)by Michael ChiklisIS AN AWESOME SERIES I CANNOT WAIT TO PURCHASE SEANSON 7
1,"Pretty counter decoration, horrible knives","While they make a nice kitchen counter decoration, these knives are pretty much worthless. The only knife I actually use is the bread knife. All the others are about as effective as a plastic knife. Do yourself a favor and NEVER buy these. Wish I had done some research before getting mine."
2,"Professional looking, but are not as sharp as they look!",So far they didn't work well on slicing apples or onions. They are serrated in a way that they are almost impossible to sharpen (the teeth are very close together). Very disappointing.
4,YUMMM!,A lovely addition to it's already beloved sibling! TING is a refreshing drink that should be more readily available!!
4,Not a Disney version,"Good solid, short telling of the classic tale. Definately not the Disney version but a great story at a great price."
1,"Terrible,unsatisfied,",It was boring and no details. It lacked details and a main idea. I was over unsatisfied with this story
1,Biggest disapointment ever!!!!,"This cradle is junk. It falls apart when you touch it. The two wooden pegs that hold the cradle onto the base kept falling out, dropping the cradle to the ground. The mattress is too big for the cradle. Junk Junk Junk."
2,"Cute, but very poor design!","This is a very cute wooden doll cradle. It's a great size and very simple. The big complaint I have is that the legs on the bottom just slide into pegs! So, every time my kids would pick it up and move it, the bottom legs just fell off, which was very frustrating for them! My husband ended up glueing the pegs in with wood glue. The other complaint is that the round pegs on the side also just slide into the actual cradle. So, you have to sort of hold the pegs when you move the cradle or the cradle will fall out. So, although, I love the look and simplicity of the cradle, I think it could have been designed better (like actually screwing the bottom on!!!). Also, the pad for the cradle is slightly too big so it doesn't lay down flat inside it!"
2,High hopes but disappointing results...,"This style of thigh boot is a nice concept but possesses a narrow toe, fragile soles, and a fairly large shaft despite being cut to resemble the shape of the legs. Unfortunately, there aren't many thigh boots made of cow/kid leather or synthetic material and also possess a flat to medium heel. Likewise, when a pair is found, they usually cost too much or there is some problem relating to the quality or fitting of the boots. I hope to someday see more affordable and good quality thigh boots for sale."
2,not what expected,"picture is very decieving,handle is way to short to reach all of your body. returned but had to call three times before my account was credited properly"
2,Misleading photo,"Product bristles are nice, thick, and seem to be well constructed. However, the 2-star review is due to the misleading photo. As mentioned in previous posts, the handle is not as long as shown in the photo (stretched photo). The handle is only 3 time as long as the head - too short for comfortable use. Even though the handle was noted as being too short by other reviews, I decided to pull the trigger in hopes that the seller corrected the problem with the product. As of November 2012, no change.Seller needs to correct the photo!!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I love the cactus brush. I've been using them for years. I like it so much that I bought a few of them, just in case they go out of production.It's not for people with very sensitive skin, but most will find it invigorating. It really gets the job done."
5,Highly Recommended!,"David Ricketts wrote this book because he developed prostate cancer; I cook from it because it's chockful of fabulous tasting, easy-to-prepare, and super-nutritious recipes. And because, as a nutritionist, I know that basing a diet on the foods featured in this book is a smart choice, not only for men who are trying to beat prostate cancer, but for anyone who is striving to stay healthy."
2,"Great title, disappointing recipes","I purchased this book when my Dad came out of remission from prostate cancer. And unless I am THE WORST cook ever, these recipes are not tasty enough to entice a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy that already has an aversion to eating. My other problem, the recipes were somewhat lengthy. As a stressed and worried caregiver, recipes need to be simple with easy to find ingredients."
2,Just OK,"What can I say, it is just OK. Alot of things if you aren't experimental on ingredients you won't use this cookbook. I would not buy again."
3,Facil de usar,"It adapts to the requirements of my Canon T2i, compact size easy to use but not easy to keep on the lens. Perfect price and quality relationship."
4,Lemons to lemonade,Refreshing to see depression as an opportunity. It is so hard in the midst to see the positive. Huber does a good job of providing both ways to cope and ways to change how we view depression.
2,Insulting,"I found this book insulting to people experiencing deep depression. The book's advice of embracing the depression by renting a movie or baking a black cake and throwing yourself a pity party is trivializing of a very devasting experience. I would be truly shocked if the writers of this book have experienced the overwhelming pain of depression.If you are looking for an interesting approach for combatting feeling down after a bad day, this is your book. It is cute if you are not searching for a solution to the crippling affects of clinical depression."
5,Easy Reading and to the point,"I really liked the book, it sums up depression and its compassionatley written. The author has been through this so you know she can relate and empathize with you, the reader."
2,I'm not sure why all the good reviews,"There is not anything in this book that is especially helpfull. It is also a thin book. If it was typset instead of handwritten it would be too short to even call a book - more of a pamphlet. I'm unsure why all the good reviews. I would think that a book called ""Depression as an Opportunity for Spiritual Growth"" would have provided more understanding of this opportunity and how to take advantage of the opportunity."
3,Solid background and interesting characters,"The hero, an ex-soldier, knows the widowed heroine from the war but thinks she is happy and was in love with her husband as the book begins. The supporting characters are also interesting, as there are two additional romance plots, one of which is background, but the other twines among the main plot rather nicely. Tension from miscommunication and other problems that arise give this book a strong plot and keep it moving."
3,A nice read!,"Another good book to be read over a cup of coffee. A nice told story by the writer.The writer amazes me how she comes out with so many stories written well. I love the way that the writer develops love in her books and does it tastefully, but everything is moving at such a fast pace. Her book is lacking in emotions and personal feelings that should be dug deeper into the souls of characters."
4,A moving love story between two very likable characters,"I have read several of Mary Balogh's novels, and IRRESISTIBLE is by far my favorite. Ms. Balogh is very adept at creating poignant moments in her books, and many such moments involving the characters Sophie and Nathaniel in IRRESISTIBLE are simply beautiful. I found myself re-reading some of the more touching passages, trying to savor every description, every thought, every emotion. Like another reader/reviewer, I enjoyed this book so very much that I didn't want it to end."
3,It was ok,Had to read this book for a book club. Not one of the better books but it wasn't a killer to get through.
4,"Hilarious at times, painfully sweet at others","This is one of the funniest Balogh books that I've read, and I've read quite a number of them. Some of the byplays had me chuckling for days. The scene where Nathaniel's friends tried to tell him about a rich widow who might make a good mistress for him is my very favorite. I didn't think the premise of the book, of old friends falling in love, would be very romantic, but it was surprisingly so. I think the recipe of a bullied widow and 4 handsome horsemen who vowed to take care of her with their lives is a potent one, for who could resist the drama of such an ensemble! Every time she looks troubled, one or more of them would immediately step up to her rescue, lucky Sophie! The humor and interesting plot makes this a winner, definitely one of Balogh's best books."
5,SUPERB!,"I loved this book so much I did not want it to end! I read most of Mary Balogh's novels, some of them I really enjoyed,others I liked less, but this one is my favorite! The characters are so endearing and the story is simply beautiful. I strongly recommend it."
1,Bland writing...,"Not to mention the fact the authors seemed to write the book to convince themselves that their close relationship was ""okay"". I didn't really like the conversational structure of the book, and it was annoying when they brought up a philosopher before giving the reader any idea of what they were going to talk about. A letdown that isn't in touch with the younger generation. (The authors are in the 50+'s range)."
4,ponography/faith/carnage visors,If those cd titles mean anything to you(all early cure albums) then run(don't walk) to your nearest really good import store and offer any amount of money that they ask for the Essence albums in stock. Bass line/vocals/ and keyboards(as well as song titles) sound just a tad like the cure. Only for you and one more wasted night are the standout songs. Emotional 80'S kids will enjoy any output from midnight records.
2,not 1st rate Heinlein,"Beond this Horizon has some witty moments and amusing dialogue, but the storytelling wasn't what I expect from a Heinlein book. for a first time reader of Heinlein this would be a disasterous choice. Beyond this Horizon is for die hard Heinlein fans who want to read everything he ever wrote. ""Free Luna&quot"
4,Hard to put down,"Stranger in a Strange Land IS the funniest book ever written. It is also far more than that. To keep it short, if you've read all of Heinlein's works you can see him develop over time. This is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to read one of his top twenty, perhaps ten. Let's see there's Stranger, The Moon, Time Enough ...."
2,Rubbed me the wrong way,"I'm not really sure what it was about this book, but most of it rubbed me the wrong way. Granted, the prose is okay (not Heinlein's best however), but the story is too moralising (and often taking the opposite side I would choose - ""an armed society is a polite society""? ), parts of the plot are bizarre, and as another reviewer pointed out, the last third of the book drags on with philosophising that doesn't seem to go anywhere (at least, not anywhere interesting). Certainly sub-par for Heinlein, both in the science and in the plot-line."
3,???,"I found the first two-thirds of this novel to be an engaging, if quaintly outdated, read, but Heinlein really lost me with the last hundred pages, in which he goes off into a bizarre philosophical discourse which has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the story. Very peculiar..."
2,Sub-par for Heinlein......,"I'm a HUGE fan of Heinlein's, but the quality of this book is far below his other works in my opinion. It seems like the story couldn't decide what it wanted to be about, first genetic engineering, then an armed society, then telepathy! Just when I'd start getting interested in one character, the focus of the book would shift to another, loose ends were rarely tied up. It's just a jumble of ideas that should have been re-written more coherently. If you're a die-hard Heinlein fan, and I am, I'd still reccomend reading it, but if you're not, don't judge the rest of Heinlein's work based solely on this book."
2,Early Heinlein with all his faults,"Genetic engineering, Second Amendment implications, the war between the sexes, life after death, telepathy -- just what is this book about?It meanders through numerous half-baked subplots (and the pointless intrusion of a twentieth century time traveler), only really dealing with genetics in detail, until it finally just peters out (presumably when the word count was sufficient for Astounding serialization in 1942).Not only is it stuffed with Heinlein's usual lectures and pontificating, but it uses the annoying device of addressing the reader directly in first and second person asides outside of its characters, and uses 1930's slang that was already obsolete by WWII.Really a mess, nevertheless, Heinlein could come up with more thought provoking ideas at his worst than today's authors can come up with at their best, so I'm giving the book an extra star, but only recommending it for Heinlein fanatics."
4,Classic Heinlein,"I was between 3 & 4 on this one, with Heinlein I rounded up.This felt more like 2 different stories, the failed coup and the resurrection of the old lady - Neither was especially compelling, or interesting.The characters were a bit more pulpy than the average, and not in the good way. The central character was TOO good, couldnt be beaten at anything - and every person around him knew it - friend or foe.It just didnt ring true or make me care what happened to them. There were aspects withing the framework of each character I could see - who doesnt sometimes wonder the point of life, or the meaningless of everything? But the things that happened were incongruous to me, given the stated premise.Still, it wasnt terrible, and Heinlein did paint the world nicely, the aforementioned notwithstanding.I am a horrible completist, and once I latch on to an author I like, I will read everything of theirs I can find - unless they REALLY start cranking out drivel (Betsy the Vampire Queen anyone?)"
3,Not a bad read,"This definitely isn't one of Heinlein's best works, and not because the language is dated. The plot itself is not that interesting - it's exciting at first and shows promise - but the story putters out miserably with a rather boring conclusion. Some ideas are introduced in here, such as genetics, and makes for a good read. If you're an Heinlein fan, you might enjoy this. It's not the best, but it isn't junk, either. Just don't expect a deep/fascinating read."
4,A good effort at an early novel.,"""Beyond This Horizon"" was published in the early 1940s. I first read it in the mid-1950s. Perhaps it has not aged as well as some of Heinlein's later efforts. However, it was good for the times.The thing is, some of the story retains its sheen. While some of the various exchanges grate on some of today's sensibilities, some of the underlaying plot is still of strong interest today. I can't give this the top rating, but I feel that it is worth a really good rating.There are some insights in the book that remain very pertinent. Exactly when does 'life' begin or end? Heinlein makes us think. And, that is a good thing.Read this book."
4,New bathroom,This looks better than it did in the picture. The brushed steel is polished and the fixture gives out a lot of light it completed the renovations and for the price it is great!
1,"could be nice looking light, but it is poorly made","I was excited to get this light fixture for our bathroom only to discover that there were problems.First, no mounting strap or screws were included to mount the fixture to the junction box.Second, no holes were drilled in the backplate so that the fixture could be mounted to the wall or anything else.Third, with a light fixture that you cannot mount to anything, where can you possibly hang it?Fourth, after taking a trip to the hardware store to buy the missing parts and drilling holes in the backplate myself, I hung the light only to discover that the faceplate was dented.Really pissed off about it after paying @ $250.00 for it.It should have been better made and handled with better quality control for that amount of money.I will never buy another product from Thomas Lighting."
4,Very nice light,"This light looks great above my double sink vanity. It was a super good deal when I bought it, and came with awesome instructions for installation."
5,"Quick, fun read","I read this book after ""How I Stole Her Husband,"" and I was absoutely impressed. While the characters were not extremely deep, you can still get an idea of where they are coming from. Liz Ireland is fantastic because she really has the reader root for the underdog with foes who are, at best, foul individuals.Without spoiling the plot (hence the vagueness)...What I liked the best about this book is she took three females from totally different places and placed them in very realistic situations that I'm sure many readers have participated in or can at least relate to. You can almost see how Danielle will treat Wilson, due to the foreshadowing in the book, and many people have realized their love for somebody only after it is too late. The guy Danielle falls for, and the definiton Edie gives her to describe him, reminded me of a very similar situation.The books gets an ""A"" for creativity and being an overall fun read."
4,Good Read,"Charming little account of three ladies in New York. The story goes on smoothly, knitting the life stories of three very different personalities seamlessly together."
5,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book, it is the first one that I read from Liz Ireland, and I'm going to read more of her books! I was dissapointed when the book ended, I wanted it to go on forever."
5,Fiery Foods That I Love,"Another great Prudhomme cookbook.Be sure and try the Scallop and Lemon Grass Soup. It's wonderful. Hot and Sour Shrimp beats any I've ever tried. Thu's Wonderful Soup, it's a spicy sensational soup. Sure to satisfy the spice lover in you. Our family loves spicy dishes, this book is a must have. Be sure to add it to your collection while it's still available. Like most Prudhomme cookbooks our family has two of each. We enjoy them each immensley. Amazon offers them at great prices making that second copy more reasonable."
2,okay,"Its an okay sneaker got some compliments ,but they gave me the wrong color i wanted the multiple color one and end up getting the black.dont wear it for the whole day feet hurts."
3,Time consuming synchronation,"I found this combo to be very time consuming. It seems that I have to synchronize the mouse and keyboard every week. Not a happy camper. If you don't mind having to synchronize on a constant basis, then this product is for you. However, if you get annoyed with constantly having to ""fix"" the mouse and keyboard just so you can use it, then this product is not for you, especially if you need to do something on the computer in a hurry."
2,Mouse Trackball Underperforms,"Mouse is unusable; not sure whether the issue is the trackball or wireless technology. I need to replace the mouse with the something usable.Keyboard works OK, but hotkeys do not work on my PC. Customer support does not answer e-mails. The keyboard only use the PS/2 style connector. The problem may be that I am going through a PS/2 keyboard/mouse to USB hub (...USB connection back to the PC)."
1,Terrible Product,"This is the most horrid wireless keyboard and mouse set that I have ever bought. The keyboard doesn't make spaces, the lights that indicate ""CAPS Lock,"" ""NUM Lock,"" and other commands don't light up, the mouse has to be reconnected every time you use it, and the adapter is very cheaply made and unresponsive. I'm going to return this tommorow. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,functional and cheep,"Well the setup is challenging. Leave your other mouse and key board hooked up, load software (both),reboot,synk mouse then keyboard.I used usb first then rebooted turned pc off and moved to ps/2. had to resynk several times.Took an hour out of my life. The logteclx700 was $150 this was $30. Only 6 foot range,but it works for me. 5way mouse and media key board good lay out.Compares to the $70-$90 models I looked at.I bought it and don't regret it.Could have paid $20 ,I wanted to be able to return if nessesary. I'll keep it!"
1,Glad this thing doesn't cost more what a waste,"I bought this setup about 3 weeks ago and initially it worked fine.Then problems with the mouse started occuring with the tracking and the optical connection freezing. You would have to click it to unfreeze, the move the mouse quickly to where you want on the screen. Then a few seconds later do this again. Over and over again. No technical support with this product. No response, nothing. Kind of figures I see that it is sold at Walmart too so that definitely describes the quality here."
1,Garbage,"I bought this keyboard for very cheap and now am paying the consequenses. If any ""a""s or ""s""s are missing in this review it is because those keys need to be pressed extra hard or they do not work. I have had the keyboard for less than 3 month and the keys are rubbing off, so I can't see the word ""shift"" or various other letter keys.DO NOT BUY"
3,"Good board, bad size","I like the design of the board - the edges make it easy to grip and carry and it doesn't slip around on my counter, however the 8x10 size is just too small to be very useful. As advertised, it is 8x10 inches, however a good inch or two on each side is taken up by the handles, so you are left with an 8x8 or smaller area for actual cutting.Go for the 11x14 version."
2,"Good content, but...","I found this book in a used book store. This book is certainly a great resource for developers starting to use Cafe, but the CD only has source code, and is not accessible for developers that do not have Visual Cafe. Throughout the book, numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes were found. This book certainly needs an errata."
2,LASTED ABOUT FOUR MONTHS,I guess that I should have known that a nylon flag wouldn't last too long but this one is badly frayed in just over four months. If you're going to fly a flag 24/7 in a windy area buy a polyester flag.
5,Excellent,A person suggested this series to me as I like to read historical fiction and mysteries. I have learned a lot about Ireland in the 600-700's and have really enjoyed the mysteries in all of the one I have read. One suggestion to new readers of this series is that you read the 1st one first and always read the preface - you learn a lot and it makes the references in the body of the book more understandably.
5,Mightily Impressed,Totally Brilliant. A very in-depth and brilliant conception of design investigation - a strong and founded response to the modern design society. Very cool and impressive.Objectified
2,Underwhelming,"This was rather underwhelming. Mostly a waste of time. Luckily, it was only an hour and 15 minutes long. They spent too much time dwelling on apple products and talking with people who just seemed unintelligent. There were a few great points, but the message that the producers wanted to get across wasn't clear. They also didn't spend much time at all on arguably the most important kind of design these days: user experience and interactive design for electronics."
5,food for thought,"I'm a software developer, typically focused on integration work so I rarely encounter users. I've had a number of opporutnities though where I've gotten to work with UX designers. I almost always come away from the experience with a shift in my thinking about how I approach my work. This documentary is like that experience but compressed down to an hour instead of months.Well worth the time."
1,not what you'd expect- in a bad way,"Saw this the night after I watched Helvetica. If you are like me and incredibly interested in industrial design- as it pertains to the user and the environment- this will leave you disappointed. I've read books by Bruno Munari and George Nelson, seen exhibits on streamline design and studied the tenets of Dieter Rams...and this film didn't come close to any of those experiences. It didn't go over manufacturing, the challenges, the history- anything of interest. It was 75 minutes of mostly younger designers talking about themselves and their own importance. Dieter Rams got maybe 5 minutes of screen time and the Eames got mentioned once. No discussion of Danish design or Mid Century Italian work. Just an incomplete thought...a perfect metaphor for today's modern ""designers.""Btw-[...]Yeah, way to be innovative."
3,"Well, but Robson Green!","A sweet, simple, not very complex, but satisfying movie. I watched it mainly for Robson, who is one of my most favorite actors (Wire in the Blood is brilliant . . .). Still, three stars is GOOD for this movie, a small, happy-ending movie, which ended just the way I wanted it too! (Maybe a secret 4 stars.)"
5,Great books - great movie,Robert Munsch is a great children's author. This movie has someone reading the books. It is not animated and is a nice change of pace from the typical fast moving movie scene.
1,RUSTED!!!,"At first when I recieved them, I was so excited! I was making cookies for a baby shower and I thought making them in shapes of bottles, bibs and onesie's would be adorable!!! So, like any normal person would do, I washed them before using them. THEY RUSTED IN MY DISHWASHER!!!! I was furious. granted, they aren't THAT expensive, but common. I ended up just making regular cookies for the shower."
3,Damaged in Shipping,"Cart arrived with a large dent in the bottom, probably the result of a forklift. Made it difficult to put together but we fixed it as best we could. Otherwise is as advertised. Always a letdown to receive damaged items, however"
5,One of my favorites from Byrnes!,"Not my first of Rob Byrnes' books, but definitely my favorite. The scheming is hilarious. The characters are, as always, loveable--even when they're not doing loveable things. Definitely worth your time."
3,Just ok!,This was not my favorite of Rob Byrnes. I felt there was no character to just grab you. I bought this book after reading THE NIGHT WE MET which is a much better work of fiction.I recommend this for only a light read. I could have taken it or left it.
3,Handel: Messiah,"A valiant effort by a small orchestra and chorus. But to my ear the Cleobury performance in King's Chapel, Cambridge, carries far more purity of sound, helped along by the marvelous acoustics (and the recording engineers) of King's. This Harry Christophers version would have done well with the addition of a harpsichord for the continuo and, again for my ear, the gentleness of the boys' voices was very much missed.Lynn Dawson gives a very professional performance but without her much finer touch some 8 years later at King's. All in all, a third or fourth place among more recent Messiah recordings."
3,"If you love Lynne Dawson, buy this.","The orchestra here really is a weak point. The number of players must be small. The choir is nice, agile, but what is best, is Lynne Dawson. Her voice is full of joy. Her voice IS joy.I have not heard a better soprano soloist in any Messiah."
1,Disappointing,I bought this book above others to get a sense of monologues that many minorities including myself could possibly relate to. Instead I found that I had bought a book filled with cliches and stereotypes. The book was a great disappointment and full of doom and gloom. Some of the monologues seemed to treat a potential audience with little respect. It would be refreshing to have a black author of monologue or soliloquy write of positive black experience along with negative. I give one star for his ability to write and also for producing something that seems rare in the search of relatable material.
4,Invicta mania continues,"This invicta watch is the latest addition to my Invicta collection. The color, design, and functionality of the piece is consistant with my other Invicta timepieces. I don't place these on the scale with higher end watches, but they perform well and I prefer to have a collection over one single expensive watch. Amazon has the best prices around on this manufacturer."
1,Quilting doldrums,"This book has wrenched me from my doldrums. The book Color Play by Joen Wolfron made me think there was hope for me. This book 'Visual Dance by the same author, has given me detailed goals, It has exercises to get me going. It has started me thinking in a different direction. I was stuck in a maze of stimulating ideas and I didn't know which way to turn. Highly recommended"
5,turtle crossing,"the TURTLE CROSSING sighn caught my eye. well with me being a turtle lover and all it was obvious I'd want to buy it. I""ll hang it on my door so I can look at it every day.I LOVE TURTLES!!!!!"
3,Good movie,"Wasn't the movie I was thinking of, but came in good shape and will be part of our Thanksgiving movie tradition!"
5,Classic Waltons,What else can you say except an eceptional and traditional story about Thanksgiving and family. A great one to watch with the entire family every Thanksgiving and throughout the year.
4,"RESPECT, CARING, LOVING.","the waltons is a wonderful movie it will teach your child good manners, respect, carring. and what youll get in return if you have good manners if you are carring(etc.). I suggest this movie too people of all ages."
1,Collection of notes and contextless extracts from other sources,"The book is a collection of scrap notes from the author and extracts from referenced sources. The notes does not hold together and the extracts are wildly pulled from the references and given no context. Even simple things like the introduction to lasers is erroneus. 60 pages are reflection curves from various materials. In addition, the book contains several errors in the given formulas copied from references.The book might work as a collection of graphs for the author's personal needs but for anyone else it has most likely a very limited use."
5,Extraodinary Women; a fantastic read with great photos by Clay Blackmore!,"I had purchased this book for two reasons; one, as a fan of Clay Blackmore's photographic style, and the second to give as a gift to my wife Sharon (who is an extraordinary woman herself!). As a professional photographer myself, this is the kind of project one dreams of, and the photos of these women are rich with style, proficiency, and depth. I would recommend this for any portrait photographer at any level as it is both wonderful to study and inspiring. I have only gotten through a little of the reading, as I didn't want to devour the whole book before I gave it to Sharon, but she promises to let me continue when she finishes it!"
5,So roomy and sturdy at the same time!,"This tent is fantastic for weekend camping!!! It is roomy, airy, and yet still sturdy enough for the mountains. The rain flap is perfect to detach on a clear and starry night, but does it's job well when necessary. Definitely a plus to have for a short weekend recreational trip!!"
1,Not for any type of weather.,I was given the earlier model of this tent for my wedding. I just tried it out for the first time camping on the beach. The first night the main pole snapped and poked a hole in the rain fly. The rain fly poles then snapped which made the tent useless. The weather wasn't bad so there was no reason for any poles to snap. I called Coleman to have the parts replaced. In order to have the defective tent fixed I would have to pay to ship it to them. This would end up costing more than the tent is worth so I have decided never to purchase another Coleman tent again.
4,look...in the sand,"look...on the ground! in the sand..its a scorpion..its a sand scorpion! like most giant g.i. action figures SS comes complete with removable body accesroies including body pad. claws, boots, knee pads, and tail. his sunglasses are glued to his face. take all the accesroies and you'll a baige pajama sam. his tail is able to suck water and shoot back out as ""venom"". but the best part is that you can choke other action figures to death with his massive claws that look heads of horned dragons. theres just two main problems... the hand armor and the knee pads come off so easily and the spikes are on his armor and shoulders are so annoying when your trying to take them off. oh, and his tail is completly unstamble. if you do buy one just to with it that toys are so post to do to you..let you have fun and use your imagintion."
5,Love the toe room,"These compression socks are more comfortable than others I have had, the toe area is not compressed like some, the band at the top is also more comfortable. I am pleased with these compression socks."
4,Very good.,"I thought this book provided a lot of useful information for someone who is beginning work in this field. I do feel like a great deal of it is targeted more towards preschool than kindergarten, but definitely addresses the needs of ""at-risk"" students. The assessment suggestions were weak in my opinion, but a good starting point."
1,Disjointed,"The storyline of this novel had potential but was very disjointed. Part of the story revolved around an editor's disappointment in a wellknown author's latest effort and her suggested revisions. This book should have undergone numerous rewrites and revisions. There were many times in the course of reading when I felt as though I had fallen off a cliff---the developmental data which should have bridged or connected one plot level to another were sadly lacking. I did, however, appreciate the moral aspect of this book; the heroine was still a virgin prior to her marriage. This is a reissue of a 1980 novel, obviously one of Ms. Michaels earliest efforts, and may explain the disconnected plot."
1,Time Waster,I am glad I checked this out of the library. I felt like it was a romance novel written for a 3rd grader. The writing was so simplistic. No chemistry between the 2 leads at all. I realize it was written in 1980 & it is now 2006 but I really felt like the writing was outdated. I did not like this book at all.
1,"Oh dear god, why did I waste my time?","All I can say is, the main character is a whiny, spineless woman who seems to be crying or on the verge of tears on every page of this book. The story is disjointed and makes no sense. I can't believe I wasted my time on this book!"
2,Eagerly eccentrically slouching,"2 1/2Deals in breezy slacker progressions ala The Sea and Cake but without much melodic memorability intact, leaving a fractured outline of whimsical experimentation."
4,"A good book, despite its sensationalistic tone","I must admit that I was a bit offended by the title of Barbara Taylor's book ""The Really Sinister Savage Shark and Other Creatures of the Deep."" After all, the sharks and other animals depicted in the book are simply trying to survive, just like human beings. But if you can get past the book's sensationalistic tone, you will find many excellent photographs and interesting facts. The book briefly discusses several species of shark (great white, leopard, thresher, etc.), as well as many other potentially dangerous marine animals: octopi, jellyfish, rays, walruses, sea snakes, and more.Although the author does point out that more people die from bee stings than from shark attacks, the book is still far from charitable to these unfairly maligned creatures. So enjoy ""The Really Sinister Savage Shark"" with your child, but be prepared to give the shark's side of the story!"
5,the best makeup,"Expensive, but well worth it. Get the flocking sponge-you'll use less product, it will be less messy, and the results will be better. Color selection is good too, even for us fair-skinned girls."
5,Works well!,Keep in mind I bought this on some deal a while back where it was like a couple bucks. But I must say it's a nice tape. I especially like how you can slide the end so that you can take accuracy inner / outer measurements. The yellow color makes it easy to spot too.
4,"No doubt it's good, but...","The other reviews are correct about this -- it's got a great holster and is very easy to read and use. The only drawback (and the reason that I'm only giving it 4 stars) is that there are no metric measurements on the tape. This is a purely inches-only product.Would be perfect if it had metric, too..."
4,"An excellent first novel, with vivid characters","I tend to read a lot of first novels, and this was one of the best that I've read in a long time. Nalo Hopkinson's characterization is wonderfully vivid. The good guys weren't saints and the bad guys weren't demons. Hopkinson's use of Afro-Carribean magic bespeaks a real understanding, whether through personal practice, prevalence in the suroundings where she was growing up, or academic study. Hopkinson's choice of locales was very refreshing, and, though I have no knowledge of Toronto, felt intensely real. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys Marion Zimmer Bradley's contemporary novels, cyberpunk, or just a fresh read. I heartily recommend this book and plan to get her next one as soon as it's out."
5,A truely original book!,"I have only just recently read BROWN GIRL, although the book has been sitting on my bookshelf for more than two years. I had discovered Nalo, because of on interview she did with LOCUS Magazine a while back. This is a wonderful book whose story seems to be deceptively simple, but which is profound and moving. Hopkinson breathes new life into scienc-fiction. BROWN GIRL IN THE RING is a definitive must-read! By the way, don't forget to buy her other books as well: MIDNIGHT ROBBER and SKIN FOLK."
3,A Strong First Novel,This is a very good first novel and is refreshingly different. It is a novel that requires you to suspend your beliefs. It doesn't matter that the author's economics are shaky or that her male characters are one dimensional. What matters is the Afro-Carribean perspective in a well written almost lyrical novel.
1,Boring,"Sometimes I just scratch my head at what kind of books get critical acclaim. I read this because I've heard in SF circles that it was a strong first novel. Instead, it's a pretty boring mish-mash with a lot of voodoo mumbo-jumbo.Not worth the money, nor the time I wasted on this novel."
4,I can't wait for her next novel.,"Forget about what you think you know about Sci-Fi. This sister is going to redefine the genre just as Octavia Butler continues to do. There's everything you'd want in a contemporary novel, mystery, love, suspense with some other world characters right out of my worse nightmares. It's set in one of my favorite cities, Toronto, but it's after a serious riot that has sent most of what's good about the city to the ""burbs."" Give yourself the first five pages and I promise you, you won't stop until you finish it. YOU GO GIRL!Jacqueline Turner Banks"
4,Excellent combination of science fiction and magical realism,"This book was excellent. It was a great display of writing skill. I'm recommending this book to anyone who likes near-future science fiction that explores current events in through tales of the future, and to anyone who likes magical realism ala Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie and Ben Okri."
4,The Real Light,I won't be long and drawn out. This gift of literature and musical balance draw the mind a picture of a life. Not an ordinary life at that. This disk flows with fluid high pitches and roars with bass. The lyrics are poems put to music. In my opinion this is an unbelievable set of songs telling a story in a way that shows the highs and lows of a life. It also shows the power that can be harnessed with a thought.
5,H.I.M are the best band in the world today,"What can I say? This is an awsome album! It is a little bit more cachy and up beat then their previous album razorblade romance, and a little less heavy than their new album love metal. Ville Valo has a very unique voice that should be heard through out Canada. He is also very hot ;D In any case, I think you should buy this album, you will not regret."
1,Did not receive,"Although I did order this item, and am sure I would have enjoyed it, I did not receive the correct book, so I cannot review the product. I can say, however, that the vendor was very responsive in refunding my money."
3,Outdated way to do car research,Would u save u money u self just go do car reseach online instead much more accurate and share opinion from otheer owner. An dis Free try Edmunds of the best out there for u new car research.
2,que le pasa a enrique?,"De verdad que me desepciono, pense que enrique tenia mucho mas para dar que simples canciones tipo sabina, ya paso la epoca de sui generis. Lo mejor para mi fue cuando dejo heroes, se ve que tenia muchas ideas y ganas se hacer cosas buenas y diferentes, pero parece que se le agotaron las ideas. las letras seran lindas pero la musica deprimente. Vamos Enrique ponete las pilas!!!!"
3,A legend deconstructed...,"Picasso the legendary artist and symbol of the 20th century is systematically picked apart through interviews with those unfortunate enough to have known him. The sadism, brutality and cruelty juxtaposed with the artist of undeniable genius and creativity is a story of a man walking on the edge of insanity and insecurities throughout most of his life. The book is tedious in places with its highly detailed continued focus on all of the wronged lovers and abused friends, but it is after all a true story. The reader will often find him/herself simply outraged/shocked by Picasso's treatment of those who loved/cared for him and wonder why these intelligent and gifted beings would subject themselves to such horrible and continuing abuse."
2,Destroyer. Destroyer. Destroyer. Destroyer.,"I'd recommend only the first 2 or 3 hours of this set (15 90-minute tapes). The rest was pretty unrewarding, as it was almost entirely focused on convicting Picasso of having an acutely dysfunctional social life. The evidence was both overwhelming and tedious. I kept going only because I'd been teased in the first hours with a little insight into the artist's amazing mind, and I was hoping for more of it (especially some discussion of Picasso's treatment of hyperspacial dimensions). Had I known these tidbits would be so few and far between, I'd have given up half way."
1,Arianna where are you,"Arianna, please visit the offices of your AOL news company and have them stop the rampant Banning of blog posters. There is a very interesting thread about this on your other book being sold at Amazon ""Huffington Post banning of comments"" in the Right Is Wrong: How the Lunatic Fringe Hijacked America, Shredded the Constitution, and Made Us All Less Safe forum. It's really out of hand and not understandable considering your Liberal politics of ""Tolerance""."
1,biased,"this book is totally Anti-Picasso, she hardly touches his Art her only concern is ripping him apart."
5,This is a real old time style classic.,"This is a good example of the way things used to be. Stanley has captured the essence of roots going right back to the early Mento style of Jamaican music. Its like a Jamaican country music with very basic instruments Like banjo,acoustic guitar,clarinet, shakers and of course the instrument that holds it all together the rhumba box. Stanley's nazal vocals bring it all together for an ensamble that is truely pure musical pleasure, its like an orgasm of the ears. Stanley does three covers From the late great Bob Marley which are really well done. I highly recommend this album for all lovers of music."
5,One of a kind,"Hey! If you read #8, Nancy mentions a 13th clone, and that she was a defect.Ya' honestly think Marilyn Kaye would forget that?"
5,NOT BAD . . . AT ALL!!!!,"I thought this was a very good Replica book. I kind of wish there would have been more action in it, it was still good, but in more of a serene way. I thought the end was sad. I understand why Amy did what she did, but it was still sad. Very interesting."
3,:),"--Amy meets Aly, the ""reject clone"" - that is, Number 13, the only one of the group without special powers. She sees how normal twelve-year-olds are living and likes it quite a bit, and starts to hang out with Aly's friends and family, who are delighted with meeting their adopted daughter's biological ""twin sister""! However, Aly feels that Amy is better at everything than she is, and after trying to climb a Ferris wheel at the local fair to prove she is just as good as Amy, she is injured and the family moves away to avoid Amy's influence. --I didn't especially like this book. The ending is terrible, cruel, and completely unlike the Amy we know. I wasn't satisfied, though the rest of the book was pretty good. --Marisa"
5,The Greatest series,The Replica series of books is the best series around. I think that Lucky Thirteen was a good book because of the context and the interesting begining and ending.
5,ONE OF A KIND,"I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SHOW LIKE THIS. IT IS REALLY FUNNY IN A OFF THE WALL WAY. JASON LEE IS GREAT AND I SURE WISHTHEY MADE MORE EPISODES. I DO WATCH THEM EVERY NITE AND HAVENT GOT TIRED OF THEM. THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO FOR ANYONES COLLECTION, GLAD I BOUGHT IT."
5,Excellent treatment of 'Viola',"'The Hyperion Schubert Edition 3' by mezzo-Soprano Ann Murray and series maestro and piano accompaniest, Graham Johnson. To the amateur listener of classical music like myself, the primary attraction of this issue is Ms. Murray's treatment of the long, and relatively late (1823) song 'Viola'. I have heard this on some collections by 'major stars' among the Lieder artists, but Ms. Murray gives it everything it needs.I always thing it odd that after having studied both general, scientific, and philosophical German, my most enduring use of my learning the language is in the appreciation of Shubert, Mozart, and the rest of the great German composers. This series makes all that classwork worthwhile."
1,Major Disappointment,"I had trouble getting the air brush to even spray thinner let along paint without using a lot higher air pressure than is recommended. I suspect that enlarging the air vent hole in the gun would help.I gave up and used a small HVLP spray gun instead. I will try again after enlarging the air vent hole - hopefully with more success, as I need to do some precision painting."
1,Doesn't teach you much - except to save your $$$,"I've wanted to learn to body cast for years now, so much so that I bought the kits and the video...Well, the video is a huge disappointment and should be avoided. Done in 2004, the audio is over modulated and nearly unlistenable unless the volume is very low. However that may not be a big deal since David Parvin (the instructor) is not very good at conveying much necessary informative details that might be important to the viewers. I've watched this DVD over and over, hoping that I've missed something or that magically he'll be able to answer even the most basic of questions through the TV screen. I haven't - and he can't!It's time to make an update on this video - I'd be glad to help shoot/produce it.Until that happens, do what I'll do: Find a workshop in your area that's available so that you can actually learn something."
1,Don't be fooled - not an instructional video,"The editorial review and author's description is misleading, you will have a hard time learning the techniques shown in the video. Almost no step-by-step instructions in the video, the video is a recording of a modelling session. As the artist himself states in the video, he uses this video to lay rest any concerns a model may have before a session.If you're very observant you may pick up a thing or two that may help you with your female torso castings."
4,A masterpiece!!!,"Wonderful a million reasons, none of which were intended. Women in oil-soaked clothes encased in plaster. What's not to like. Works on many levels!I await the unrated extended edition."
1,junk,"This is the worst set I have ever bought, disk 2 doesn't play all of the second episode and none of three. Disk four doesn't play at all. Total waste of money."
1,Inappropriate,"Too much swearing and a sense of shallow that I never seen in any tv series, it's a pity, the idea was potentially a great idea...too bad."
5,saw an episode on tv...,"I saw an episode on tv while channel surfing. Needless to say I was hooked and ordered the complete series. I can't see how they cancelled this show, I enjoyed every episode. The series finale did what it promised to do, bring closure to some of the bigger story lines for the fans. I plan on watching the series again in a few years."
5,Fascinating Series,"**This review is for the series and not the box set, which I do not own.It's unfortunate that I didn't get into this series before it met an untimely demise. It is a really clever series that focuses on dark humor and quirky characters. The mix of characters is actually very effective: the wise, experienced one, the one with attitude who brings everyone back down to earth, the British guy that gets into all kinds of trouble, and the newbie who serves as the main character to teach the audience about being a Reaper. They all work well together to form a dysfunctional family that you yearn to be a part of.We also get to take part in another family -- George's family from before she died. They happen to be just as funny and dysfunctional as George's Reaper family.With its originality, sharp writing, and lovably flawed characters, Dead Like Me is a series you can't miss."
4,How I miss this series,"Dark dark show, but was funny in it's own right. Wish this series had continued, but glad to see it was on to begin with!"
5,Love this series,Havent had time to give kudos but shipping was super quick and loooove the dead like me series dont know why it was canceled.. hope they bring back someday I love all the characters... funny.. smart .. love Georgia :)
4,One MAJOR Flaw,"This deserved a five star rating except for one very disappointing thing. Though one would assume these are close-captioned, they are not. Had I known, I wouldn't have bought this. One the box it states that bonus features may not be CC. Now, the CC symbol is not there, so I should have been aware, but the notge about the bonus features threw me.No Closed Captioning!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Perfect, except no closed captions, which was unexpected.","I don't buy many complete series, but this one was worth having. It's great and good fun.Though there is no problem with the sound, I generally like to have the closed captions on anyway. Alas, there are NO closed captions for these episodes. That's a shame. I probably still would have purchased it if I had known this ahead of time, but I would rather have purchased the series with closed captions. I would have paid more for them, too, if that had been an option on the complete series."
1,One sailor's log,"Perhaps the others reviews were family or friends. I think this ""book"" reads like a sailor's log, with a few details added here and there. It's a dry, ""we went here with this sailboat and this crew, then I went there with a different boat and crew, etc."" Not recommended."
4,Good Ideas,"Un ottimo libro abbastanza completo, ricco di informazioni utili, da approfondire poi singolarmente per lo sviluppo.Ma la strada da percorrere è chiara."
3,Helpful but...,This book was not what I was expecting. Very helpful if you have never booked a show and are just starting out. Some of the information is a little basic.
4,Read it TWICE - very helpful,"Jeri Goldstein doesn't miss a beat. This book was so informative that I read it once, put it away for a short time, and then read it again. I couldn't believe how many details I had missed! The most recent time, I studied it with highlighter and pencil in hand. (*My favorite information-discoveries were in the side-bars*)I believe this book is very important for those looking to help their music career along. As a musician, I need to learn to get my foot in the door to new venues. I have implemented several techniques and ideas already this week.Read, then re-read my friends. You'll be glad you did.Rebecca FullerBriarwood Musicians"
1,I agree with dulcie.,The previous reviewer said it all. Wendi Lee thinks that zombies can be created and sent out to work in sweatshops and behind the counter at McDonalds. Oh??? The book is badly written as well. Dull and unbelievable -- a deadly combination.
2,running around with voodoo,"When a professor finds voodoo warnings in his office, he calls in private detective Angela Matelli to pose as a student and find the truth. Are the warnings really a gag, or are there real zombies within the ivy walls of his Vermont college? Once at Hartmore College, Angela finds that almost everyone she comes in contact with has been in Haiti and had some contact with the voodoo religion. And tensions are high among them. Somehow, Angela has to cut through the clutter and find the truth--and manage to avoid becoming a zombie herself.Author Wendi Lee writes with an engagingly light style. Angela, with her overprotective mother and marine background makes for an attractive protagonist. The story itself, however, may be a little too light for real mystery fans. Although everyone has been to Haiti, sorting through the suspects shouldn't be so easy.HABEAS CAMPUS is enjoyable light reading but is unlikely to stick with you for long."
3,Where is Angela?,"A large part of Angela Matelli's charm has come from her interactions with her extended (and supportive) family. In this entry in the series, her family is minimized to a couple of phone calls and a few minutes in the first chapter. The plot is unusual--voodoo on a New England college campus and the supporting characters are fairly well written. But without the help and interference of the Matelli family, Angela seems to lose her edge and could be any number of interchangeable female private investigators. Despite a better than average writing style and story line, Habeus Campus disappoints. I probably will wait for the next to come out in paper back and am glad I bought this used."
2,could have been much better,"Like many of these reviewers, I had such high hopes for this book. The premise is very intriguing and I really wanted to find out what a family would be like in these circumstances. Unfortunately, the author throws in a pointless romance with the lawyer which is very distracting to the main storyline. Switching back and forth between perspectives with the flashbacks being tossed in randomly made it even harder to follow. The characters were absolutely two-dimensional and uninspired. The ending was a complete copout and could have been predicted from page 1. The only unique thing that I liked was the differing typefaces for each character's viewpoint. (It was also the only way I could keep everyone straight.)Horrible book. I won't read anything from Jodi Picoult again."
3,My Sister's Keeper,"I first discovered Jodi Picoult when a friend loaned me her copy of ""Keeping Faith"". I loved the book and have also read her latest ""Tenth Circle"". I have just finished ""My Sister's Keeper"" and I have to say that this was my last Jodi Picoult read. The way she moves from one character to another with each chapter is monotonous and never really pulls them together. I kept waiting for the story to ""start"". I was intrigued by the premise and therefore very disappointed in the way it was handled. I thought the ending was a cheap shot. It was as if she couldn't figure out how it should end, so she just killed off the main character! As I said, after Tenth Circle and now this one, I am ready to move on to other authors. Sorry!"
2,"interesting idea, poor writing","I picked this up for the intriguing premise. But the book hardly lived up to its potential. The writing was rambling, full of philosophic cliches and preachy moments that made it hard to get into. The author also seemed to be throwing in far too many subplots; for instance, the brother's arsonist escapades distracted from the real story. Many characters were quite one-dimensional - the mother's single-minded devotion to Kate might have made her a good villain, but surely not a very realistic character. I was especially disappointed by the girls' characters. After reading the book description, I expected Anna to be a strong teenage girl character (always fascinating to read about.) But in this story she's nothing more than a pawn in this philosophical exercise. All in all, a less-than-worthwhile read."
2,Ridiculous ending!,"This book had an intriguing plot - that a 13-year-old would seek medical empanciation from her family so she could make her own decision about donating an organ to her sister. It held my interest. The ending, however, was out of left field and a complete betrayal of everything that had gone before. Scratch Jodi Picoult off my list of authors!"
4,You'll Cry a River,"Words can't express how deeply this book moved me. My Sister's Keeper pretends to be just a lengthy tale, but somehow permeates itself into your heart by novel's close. Conceived to be a donor to leukemia-ridden Kate, Anna has been poked and prodded through several medical treatments to save her sister's life. She's tired of it all. Anna just wants to be left alone, made to feel normal, and allowed to be her own person. At least that's the story Anna tells her lawyer. Underneath it all, everyone's got a story and is lead by their own emotions to do what's best for Kate, as evidenced by the plot's seven different viewpoints. I wept for Anna and Kate, wrestled with Sara and Brian, and hoped for Campbell and Julia. Jodi Picoult has a flair for rich, colorful characterizations and for weaving an affecting yarn. A little long winded, but I loved it. I mean, it's been a while since a book has made me cry like a baby."
1,Interesting premise but shallow writing,"I agree with some previous reviewers that the character development is thin, the format is annoying, and the ending is manipulative. The author's hand is so visible in this book that I could never lose sight of it. In spite of a good premise, the story never reaches its potential. Someone told me that it was a well-done view into the teenage mind. For that purpose I would suggest the book ""Miss American Pie"" by Margaret Sartor instead."
1,Cliches and melodrama,"I read this book just over three years ago and one quote still sticks out: ""Darkness is relative."" This is coming from the misunderstood arsonist son. Every page had a fortune cookie of wisdom, along with tired metaphors and characters that evoke no empathy. The popularity of this book makes me a little ashamed to be a woman, in that they seem to LOVE it. The ending was a cop-out, not that it mattered much; an interesting ending wouldn't have been enough to save it. I also would like to point out that I was excited to read this and the idea seemed it had a lot of potential. A waste really."
2,Great until the ending.....,"I enjoyed this thought provoking book until I saw where the ending was going. I hadn't expected this author to wrap the book up with this type of ending. Like someone said, it turned it into a Lifetime Movie book. I don't know if I will read more of her books, since people keep telling me this is her best."
4,Perfect for anyone struggling in a complex family,"Coming from a family where things have always been complicated, I felt great comfort in listening to the struggles of the various characters in, My Sister's Keeper. This story is not only perfect for someone living in an unusual family situation, it is a great book to read if you have sisters. Take a step back and hear each seperate account of each of the members of the family and learn to be sensitive to people's actions and reactions when they're lives and love are at stake."
3,What a story! What a letdown!,"I devoured this story! So contemporary in its main issue! So interesting, to read the variety of points of view (though Kate's side would have been interesting--does SHE really want her sister to risk the organ donation or not?). So disappointing, the way Picoult let me down with her conclusion! I was eager to find out which way the story would go, but to let me down in the end like this story does is a true disappointment. It makes me hesitate to pick up another of Picoult's books, wary of a similar ""easy-way-out"" ending."
5,Fist time Jodi Piccoult reader,"This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I cannot wait to read every book she has written! The way the story is told is unique and very interesting. Keeps you on your toes. There wasn't a dull moment in this book. No, the ending was not one I saw coming, but it still kept me hanging on every word I read and I still love her style of writing. Must read this book!!"
5,Engaging and Thought-Provoking,The novel is very well written. The storyline reads smoothly and is engaging. By the end of the novel you will have seen the sides to all the stories. At the end I was thinking what would I have done?
5,One of her best....,"Piccoult continues to do extensive research before her writings and truly holds your interest from page one until the dramatic ending. Have loaned this to other friends as well our book club chose this, all reveiws were great. A must read."
4,My sisters keeper was like no book i've read before,"My Sister's Keeper is a story of a young girl, Anna, who sues her parents for the medical rights to her own body. She was conceived only to be the genetic match and donor to her elder sister Kate who has leukemia. It was supposed to be a onetime ordeal, but as life changes, so do the demands towards Anna's body. As she gets older, she realizes how little control she has over her own body and questions who she really is. As she later sets out to change all of this and the book is lead through the trial process. This book is written from the viewpoints of all the characters."
4,The ending was perfect,"I guess I can understand why so many people say they hated the ending but I thought it was perfect. In fact, it's the only ending that could've really worked. If you think of what you might've wanted to happen, it wouldn't have had the same resonance.Good story. The audio version is well done with different narrators handling each section narrated in first person by the different characters. Makes me want to read more by Picoult. (This was just my second book of hers, after the also good ""Nineteen Minutes."")"
5,A MUST READ,"I loved this book - raising a lot of ethical questions and really felt for Anna. I'm glad I haven't seen the movie, as I believe it is quite different."
5,Entertaining Read,This book was a required read for school and I ended up loving it. It was very well thought out and informative regarding the medical terms. The time that Jodi Picoult spent doing research showed. It was a very emotional book that kept me up at night.
4,ending is disappointing,"I totally agree with the reader who said that the ending of this book was disappointing. The entire book up to that point was engrossing, emotional, involving...I couldn't put it down, even though I thought some of the characters (Jesse especially) were caricaturist and clichéd. It seems the end was totally contrived to give some kind of ""twist"" and moral to the story...it did not fit well with the rest of the book at all."
4,A page turner and a good read,"Took this book out the library yesterday and 1pm, finished it this morning at 10am. Even though this is a ""typical"" Jodi Picoult book in formula - court scenes and surprise ending, I just love the stories this woman weaves and the insights she has. The subject is close to my own heart, having a child with a fatal disease, and I was brought to tears many times throughout the story (have the tissues ready for the end of the book). I would recommend it, especially if you enjoyed Picoult's other books."
3,Ups and Downs,All I can say about this book is that it had it's ups and it had it's downs. All the jumping back and forth really turned me off for about a 3rd of the book but I charged through until the end because I wanted to see how it ended. It was a good book but not one of her best.
4,My first Jodi Picoult book but def. not my last!,"I'm not going to include a summary of this book, just simply my impressions. I'll start off by saying this is by no means a feel good book. But it is an honest look at human emotions, and relationships. I appreciate that Ms. Picoult doesn't try to sugar coat complex, emotionally charged issues. I enjoy that this book is written from multiple viewpoints to really get to the heart of the issue. My one beef with this book is the ending...which is kind of a cop out to me. In spite of that I feel that this is a well-written, worthwhile novel."
4,Excellent read,"This is an excellent read with a real-life dilemna presented in a solide and rather suspenseful manner. With medical research and genetic engineering often in the press, the outlying ramifications of such technology is brought to light in this story. The family relationships, the idea of 'responsibility', the way the individual characters handle a chronic and life-threatening illness and potential salvation are all worthy food-for-thought. This would make for a wonderful discussion with teens - except for a gratuitous sexual encounter that is simply not appropriate for the teen audience that might otherwise gain from this story. I'm sorry that Ms. Picoult felt it necessary to include that bit - it simply wasn't necessary to the story or character development."
2,Melodrama & Cliches,"The book is long, but I'll be brief...Interesting topic. Middle falls flat. Written in fits and starts with flashes of artsy philosophy and continuous medical procedure that eventually loses its relevance. Characters lose credibility half way through. The side plots devolve into cliches with no climax---Jesse, Campbell and Julia, the cold-hearted mother, Judge De Salvo...blahblahblah. FILLED with melodrama, no surprises. Not only could I see the ending coming a mile away, I could see the entire book unfold half way through and thought it was intentionally written that way to build to something less trite. Chicken Soup for the Soul, but with the occasional F-bomb (which really is not a problem.)Critics say that this book was not as well written as her earlier work, and I might give another book a try---it just seems like she got tired around page 250. Disappointing, considering a strong beginning."
5,Amazing story,"What a compelling story. I was hooked from the first chapter right up until the last one. This is every parents nightmare, that their child would become sick, we would do anything to save our loved one. My heart broke for this family, and there are many tearful moments but there were also many moments that made me chuckle, thanks to Campbell, the lawyer. I would very highly recommend this book. Our book club read it and I gave it a 10, which is our highest rating, as did many of our members. This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I have read and will definitely be reading more. Great story!!"
1,Mawkish mucky muck,"Welcome to my first and last Jodi PicoultJust not my kind of a read ... if it is going to be melodrama then I will take it in period costume. This was trying to be philosophical but fell on its arty arse. The multiple narrative was woeful ... the ""voice"" used was the same, usually impossible to tell (without names) who was narrating the chapter. (Maybe the problem is that I have recently read some great change of voice/point -of-view multiple narratives that work in spades!!)I found the characterisations a bit on the clunky side, lacking credibility. In fact there were too many characters who were not relevant to the plot ... what was the point of the lawyer's old love affair?Maybe the only problem with the surprise ending is that they weren't all treated to the same fate!"
2,Not for the faint of heart,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I began reading it on an airplane and feel I should have stopped after about 30 minutes when I sensed this wasn't going to be anything very uplifting. Because it was a long flight I kept reading. The flight was just as long on the way home, so I read.Whereas the author writes with an easy -to -read type of style, I did not appreciate the constant back and forth between past and present. And I'm sure she was trying to be accurate with the correct names of treatments, meds, disease terminology, etc., but it got to be too much.I lost a brother to leukemia just under 3 years ago. My other brother's wife died of metastatic melamona nearly 1 year to the day after his death. If you have had recent illness or death in the family, I would stay away from this book. The ending is not only heart wrenching, but depressing. Yes, sometimes life sucks, and this is not what you should read if you've gone through tough times recently."
3,Good book (until ending),"I apologize for my last review as someone commented I gave away the ending. I guess I will just say in general, the ending was all wrong for this book and felt too forced. I knew it wouldn't be a happily ever after ending, but the ending showed poor writing I thought. I just felt like the reader got cheated out of what was a really great story until the final 20 pages."
2,A Stinker Among Exotic Treasures,"My basic feeling about this book is that it is about 150 pages too long. My second reaction was that the ending was far-fetched and unbelievable. I got tired of the lingering ""mysteries"" (why did Campbell have a ""service"" dog? why did Campbell leave Julia, the love of his life without an explanation? Why did Julia take him back so easily after 15 years, and with so many unanswered question?)The ad nauseum rhetoric also got on my nerves. How many times and in how many different ways and to how many different people can you can you ask the same question?Jody Picoult is one of my favorite authors. I never expected to write a poor review on one of her books. I have read many of her other books and they are wonderful, so I won't give up. I just hope that's the only stinker in the bunch."
1,I don't know how this book has over 1000 reviews and is still rated three stars.,"I found this book's plot to be manipulative and contrived, the characters were weak and the ending atrocious. There is nothing to be gained by reading this book. Read ""The Art of Racing"" instead. You'll thank me."
1,A very disappointed reader,"I have read books before that I would term ""bad"", but I have never read a book that I honestly regreted reading, until this book. The first 400 pages were amazing- wonderfully writen and so adictive I didn't want to stop reading. Then I got to the end. To say it was a let down would be far too mild a description. It wasn't that the ending was upsetting, it was that it made the rest of the book pointless. I won't go into details, (to avoid ruining it for anyone still compelled to read it) but the ending was just so horrible that it is difficult to even fathom. Tragic endings are fine, but this ending really made me wonder how the author could waste her time with the first 400 pages if she was planning to end it how she did. I simply cannot express how much I dislike this book because of how it ended. I have never read one of Jodi Picoult's books before, and my Sister's Keeper has convinced me that I never should have picked up one of her books in the first place."
3,Exploitive narrative at its best,"I am not surprised to see that many of the five star reviews are written by women, this story is estrogen rich. Definitely designed to tug the heart strings, the story is engrossing. However, a good story is not the sum total of writing.I found much of the language overwrought; a package of Oreo cookies makes its ""suicide plunge"" down a vending machine chute (oh, come on!). The teen-age characters talk like thirty-year olds, and the male and female voices are interchangeable. Although each character has a section set aside to him or her, the voices are close to identical.The ending is a cheap, theatrical, made for t.v. movie ending as is popular with a certain type of fiction today. It it remniscent of the headlines on the tabloids at the check out counter.When I read the reviews it occurs to me that no one dared objectively review a book that dealt with a very tough subject."
2,Disappointed by stereotypical characters,"While story was engrossing, the characters were stereotypes. A lot of the plot was therefore not terribly believable. I actually felt so outraged by the ending, I am writing my first review on Amazon.com. I will never read another book by this author."
3,The premise is great but the story lags,"I had never heard of Jodi Picoult before reading this book. The reason I picked it up was becuase I was intrigued with the premise of the story and I got into it within the first chapter. The characters were engaging and found myself wanting to know what would happen next.Although I enjoyed the book enough to read it in one day, I felt that at times it strayed too far from the family's dynamic (i.e. the lawyer, the GAD, and their histories - who cares?)making me question where the author was going. For me the big disappointment was the ending - it just seemed too improbable and a little too pat, like she had to wrap the story up and hadn't fully thought through how she was going to do it.However, having said that, I will still recommend this book to friends."
5,OUTSTANDING READ,"I loved this book. I have ready many of Ms. Picoult's books and I am a fan, but I go into each book with an open mind. She never disappoints and this is no exception. Surprise ending. I really don't like flashback/flash-sideways/flash-forward books at all, but I was able to get past it because of the excellent content."
5,amazing!,This book is absolutely gut wrenching. You can see both sides of the story with such clarity.I couldn't even imagine going through something like this. I couldn't put the book down and have told everyone I know to read it.
3,"Interesting Topic, Bad Storyline","A very interesting and complex issue, very slow in the middle (why was there so much detail given to the relationship between the guardian and the lawyer? It added nothing to the overall story and was just a distraction from the topic at hand) but not a bad book overall. The biggest issue I had with this book was the ending. It think it was supposed to be irony or maybe shock, but it was really just overly simplistic and very unrealistic."
2,I know I'm the minority but...I just seemed so forced,Okay let me say this was an easy and emotional read. How awful for these poor people... But the little sister was genetically engineered to save the older sister and we never hear anything more about it? That seemed weird to me. And the surprise ending didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was how Picoult tied everything up so neatly and unrealistically at the very end. I felt insulted by that ending and it turned me off to Jodi Picoult. I'm not sure I'll read another one of her books. I did like the little side story with the lawyer. I found that story line to be more enjoyable than the rest of the book.
3,Plot-driven,"Is this book well-written? Yes. Did it keep me turning the pages? Yes. Would I recommend it? No. But since I don't want to spoil it for potential readers, I will speak abstractly. On the surface this novel is all about issues and personalities or character(s). But it soon becomes apparent that the driving force is plot and drama. This becomes absurdly so at the end of the book, where, first, there is a surprise that completely undercuts both the main issue and the interestingness of the main character, Anna, and second there is a plot development that ""resolves"" things shockingly and movingly but ultimately gratuitously. The main disappointment was the former, though. I felt it was a betrayal of the reader, who had gone along grappling with what turns out to be a non-issue. For all its up-to-the-minute moral ""relevance"" and complexity, this book opts for a perfectly moral universe of totally ""good"" people instead of real characters facing real dilemmas."
5,FABULOUS!,This was a selection for our neighborhood book club and we all loved it. The characters are so well-developed and by the end of the story you really begin to understand and relate to each one. This novel is GREAT to discuss; there are many issues and topics that are introduced. I am a voracious reader and it takes something pretty special for me to take notice - this book did it!
4,My Sister's Keeper,This is a great book! I recommend it to any girl with a sister. It makes you appreciate your sister more. It is a heart-warming story that has an ending you cannot believe! It looks really long but for the most part is an easy read.
3,3.5 stars,"If it weren't for the lousy ending I would have given this book four stars. Jodi Picoult is a great story teller and knows how to keep her reader coming back for more. This book gives us a lot to think about: medical ethics, family responsibility, genetics. I hated Sara, though, I just can't fathom a mother favoring one child over the others, although I suppose there are plenty of people like her in the world."
3,Great story!,I enjoyed reading this book. There were a lot of great twists and turns and it really had me thinking about what is morally right vs. what your gut tells you is right. I didn't like the books ending though. I preferred the movie ending.
3,"Great Foundation, Awful Execution","Picoult sets up a fascinating framework for a very complex, heart wrenching story. The parents of Kate, who has a rare form of Leukemia, with a high mortality rate, are determined to have another child who would be a genetic match for her. They conceive Anna, who has spent her entire life donating parts of herself to keep her sister alive.At thirteen, Anna is expected, in a last ditch effort, under a highly unlikely successful outcome, to donate one of her kidneys to her sister. Instead, she sues her parents for medical emancipation.Most of what follows is predictable. However, the ending is so bad, and could have so easily been avoided, that it is unforgivable. If you read this book, stop reading it after the judge has rendered his decision. If you can't resist finishing it, and you're as annoyed, as I predict you will be, read several of the other somewhat negative reviews afterwards, and realize you could have been spared your grunts."
5,Intense but wonderful,"I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult, she is always a good writter but this book it blew my mind away it's just like the best book i've ever read. being able to see what the entire family plus a few extra characters it really shows it has the best twists I have ever seen. if you read this book be ready to be impressed and fall in love with not only Anna but Kate and the entire family."
3,Disappointing Ending,"I won't write a summary since so many others here have. I loved the buildup to the end, and was very disappointed. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but those who have read it know of what I speak. It was a lovely, thought provoking story. I was up late for several nights reading; I could not put it down. The surprise ending was not that surprising to me, and was a major let down. The characters were beautifully described, and developed greatly, over time. To have these people's lives unfold before my very eyes, switching from past to present, was a real treat. I was attracted to the sense of ambiguity about moral right and wrongs, if they exist, here. That is the best part. I recommend this with reservations."
3,Fascinating - but too many cliches,"I liked this book quite a bit - I enjoy the way Ms. Picoult writes from each character's perspective. It adds dimensions that would be lost if the story were from one point-of-view. The book raises many ethical and moral dilemmas, all of which are fascinating.There were people in my book club who hated this book because of the ending - I don't feel that way. I thought the ending was startling and from way out in left field, but I appreciate a writer who is able to do that. And any story that generates this much love/hate is worth reading.I just wish Ms. Picoult wouldn't end each and every chapter with a cliche. It absolutely drives me batty -- it's like the last sentence of every chapter and section is the title of a self-help book! I'm sorry for nitpicking - but I've read more than one of her books and they were like that too. She's quite talented and doesn't need to resort to trite phrases."
1,cheap writer trick,This book starts out superbly. The characters are believable and real. Unfortunately Ms. Picoult writes herself into a corner and resorts to a cheap too pat and too neat ending. She does throw in heart wrenching emotion but I would have preferred a more honest attempt to deal with the unfolding drama. Cheap trick.
5,One of my favorites,"This book is one of my favorite books I've ever read. This book circulated through my family, and I can't bring myself to sell it. Jodi Picoult has this fantastic ability to withold critical information from chapter to chapter, keeping you guessing. At times, however she does seem to give too much seemingly needless in-depth information when developing characters. Fantastic story, with great twists. A real tear-jerker."
3,"Great story, but misinformative at the end",WARNING: SPOILER ALERTI was thrilled to be reading this book until the last 5 chapters when one of the main characters suffered a seizure. Ms. Picoult wrote that something was inserted into the individual's mouth while he was convulsing. This is something that should be AVOIDED when a person is having a seizure; Ms. Picoult has done an extreme disservice to her readers and people with epilepsy by illustrating this procedure in her book. I hope that no one will take the situation as truth; people who have seizures and have foreign objects placed in their mouth can seriously injure themselves and others. There is no need to place a foreign object in their mouth! How archaic and ignorant for Ms. Picoult to include that in her story.
3,Fast Moving Emotional Rollercoaster,"I found My Sister's Keeper to be a very well written novel that kept me wanting more. That said, it played into a lot of stereotypes that were to predictable: the angry brother unable to ""save"" his sister, the sick sister who everything else revolved around, and the ""forgotten"" little sister who has to do something big to get attention. Unlike other readers, however, I enjoyed the relief given to the reader with the romance and how it made their empathy and reaction to the family more believable. I recommend this book if you enjoy reading for the sake of reading and don't mind a good cry. This is not a feel-good story... more one that makes you thankful for what you've been given and hopeful that you never have to make the choices this family did."
2,Disapointing Ending,"I largely enjoyed reading the book (up to a certain point), although Anna seemed far too mature for her years and conversely many of the adults far too immature for theirs.The part that really left me feeling disappointed was the ending. The author took the cheap and easy way out and killed off Anna making her struggles seem pointless, her body nothing more than a ready source of spare parts. It seems the only value she had was to save her sister.I would like to have seen how the family dealt with the death of the sister and how the family adjusted to the difficult changes her loss would have brought. The end was a litle too ""Disney"" for me, life is not like that and solutions are rarely so easily presented, because of that I would have a hard time recommending this book."
5,The best of Jodi Picoult,"I have not yet read all of Picoult's novels. I only just discovered this amazing writer in 2007! As an avid reader I can't believe I did not know of her novels before. I am currently starting on reading my 5th Picoult novel and have so far loved all of them. However,"" My Sister's Keeper"" is my favorite and has made my personal top 20 list of all time fav novels. Picoult created characters you truly care about. The ending is like nothing I have ever experienced before in a novel."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"This novel was an absolute treat. I could not put it down. Picoult's treatment of such a controversial subject, and her portrayal of the deeply conflicting emotions are definitely part of what makes this novel so wonderful. She makes you see both sides of the issue and understand, to the point where you can't side, both the sister's and the mother's situation. Absolutely fantastic. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good, hearty read."
5,Great Book,One of the better books I have read this year. I thought the author did an awesome job in understanding so many sides to an issue. I will definitely pick up other books by this author - really enjoyed her style and storytelling - couldn't put it down.
4,Diseases!,"Picoult's book was a life saver. It is informative, it responded to my doubts and fears, it answered my questions. It showed me a way to live with herpes holistically. It taught me to think positively about something that was making me very negative.I have given the book to several family members and friends who have herpes and they have loved it too. I highly recommend this book."
2,Too contrived,I was not blown away. It was like reading a soap opera script. The ending was so contrived.
3,Fascinating topic; Ending Was a Cop Out,I found this book fascinating until the ending. The ending did not explore how a family would go forward after experiencing the events that they did. I thought the author sold the story short by not going there.
1,a waste of a good subject,"If I wanted a beach blanket novel I would have gone to the romance section. I can't believe I paid full price for this book. If you MUST read this book don't waste your money, go to the library. this book is pure cliché, it's the literary version of paint-by-numbers. It's really disappointing since the subject matter has such great potential, but one good idea is not enough to carry an entire 400+ page book. I wish someone with talent would rewrite this book."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF A GOOD IDEA,The premise of this book is excellant. Everything else is awful. I can't believe I wasted an entire afternoon reading it... I won't waste anytime repeating what other reviewers have already stated...I just wish that I could give the book 0 stars.
2,One of the CD was missing,The first set was not good. Product was sealed so I assumed it was in good condition. When I opened it to pack first CD was missing. I called and after some conversation. The replacement was shipped. I received it just before I left on an European trip. So all ended O.K.
1,The Most Disgusting Book I've Ever Read,"Are you guys (who think this book is just great) serious? The fact that a person would create another person solely for the purpose of saving a prior child's life is farfetched and selfish enough; the characters are all completely unsympathetic as well. The mother is hideous. The older daughter, Kate, is a ghost who is always portrayed as the ultimate victim. The father is a ghost. The brother is a crazy psycopath, and the parents don't even take the time to notice. By the time I finished the book, I wanted all of them to just shut up. The fact that it basically all ""works out"" in the end (meaning the mother and father got exactly what they asked for to begin with) makes me sick. This book and it's author are boring at best, and disgusting at worst."
2,Lost me at the end,"This novel addresses many ethical, moral, personal, family issues for more than 200 pages in what seem to be interesting (and medically accurate) ways. The ending is not accurate.Warning: If you haven't read the novel, the next sentences will wreck the ""surprise"" at the end.Because I am a medical writer/editor and have friends who have been (a)a living donor of a kidney to a sibling and (b) a spouse who approved donation of all possible organs (tragic drowning; spouse could not be revived), I know that the medical information is just not right....a lawyer can't make the decision...not even a legal guardian of a minor. Also, relatives would NOT say goodbye to someone still on life support AFTER the organ donation. Life support is removed before the organs are ""harvested."" I felt that the writer got to the end of her ""schedule"" of a book a year and just wrapped it up fast to meet a publisher's deadline. Picoult's novels are getting more and more formulaic. Not a fan any more."
2,interesting premise...but predictable and unrealistic,"The novel had an intriguing premise- one sister being created solely to keep another sister alive. It was also written in a clever style- each chapter through a different character's perspective. However- both the completely predictable romance and the completely unrealistic/ridiculous ending had me frustrated that I spent time reading this novel. I had high hopes for the interesting subject, and was very disappointed!"
4,Good Read.,"Just to forewarn you, the ending of the book is different than the ending of the movie. I saw the movie first and didn't realize the ending was different from the book. But I still liked both the movie and the book."
5,HEART GRABBING BOOK,Anyone who wants a twisting heartbreaking novel This book is the one. Jodi Picoult goes from a story about cancer to a story about family. Truly a great book.
5,Couldn't put it down.,"This book is amazing. I am not a big reader but I escaped into the world that Picoult created, put everything else on hold, and read it in a weekend. I haven't seen the movie and don't think I will. The book was wonderful! I highly recommend it."
3,Not this one,"I've been a Jodi Picoult reader from the beginning. I can usually count on a good read about an interesting topic, and this novel doesn't disappoint in that aspect. That being said, I have never been so angry about a novel's conclusion. In fact, it made me so hopping mad I threw the paperback on the floor! I don't need ""and they all lived happily ever after"" but I detested the choices Picoult made in the last 14 pages of this otherwise gripping novel."
4,My Sister's Keeper,"This book was unforgetable there are a lot of twists to it which keeps you interested. I could not put it down ! I love this Author and recommend all of her books. The ending is a suprise! That will have you wondering How Jodi came up with this twist in fate . Denise A Marshall Author of The Childrens book "" The Adventure Of Hip Hop [ Hip Hop And the Yellow Hat & Hip Hop Finds the Yellow Easter Egg }"
2,Stupid concepts,"An interesting concept where a child conceived to provide bone marrow for her sister with leukemia, employs a lawyer to protect her rights and prevent her parents from further exploiting her. In the mix are unintentionally abusive and neglectful parents and a ridiculous story line with a lawyer. The end of the story is pure daytime soap opera and not worthy of discussion,but I must take issue with Ms. Picoult's creation of a lawyer with epilepsy which is so poorly controlled he needs a support dog, yet continues to drive a car. Ridiculous, the man's a lawyer, for heaven's sakes, he may be stupid but he is bound by a code of behavior. Also, he is ashamed and secretive about his condition. Why? This is not explained and in 2010 this is ridiculous.These things spoiled the book for me. Picoult does this sort of thing in many of her books, it's like she can only do so much research and then lets things slip for the sake of the plot. shabby."
5,Wow!,"I had never heard of this book until late July when I was require to read a book for my Diversity class. This book was on the list and I was drawn to it the moment I saw the title. As I read, I couldn't help but to keep on reading, not wanting to put it down. It is an amazing, heartfelt story that caputres the raw emotion of it's charecters. I found myself crying at the end. It is surely something I will read again."
5,Amazing!!!,"Jodi Picoult can write! This story is an amazing story of what real people have to go through. I read it 5 times because I loved it so much! I will tell you now, READ IT! I admit I did cry a lot a times but mostly the end. My Sister's Keeper get 5 stars from me!"
2,Wouldn't read another by Picoult,"I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend. The premise was interesting and timely. However, I was irritated throughout the novel by the authors use of analogies and similes. Everything was described in this manner: When this happens, it's like this. I understand that many times it is necessary to describe an event or emotion in terms of something else so that other people can relate - but, the analogy must make sense for this to be effective.As I said, the premise was interesting, but it didn't seem to go anywhere. At the end, when characters are faced with difficult choices, and you begin to feel that there will be some resolution, the author throws in a ""surprise ending"". Even though the ending is tragic, it felt like the easy way out to me, at least for the author. She never has to make a statement or take a stand on the issue.All in all, I was disappointed, and I don't think I would read another by this author."
1,Mission NOT Accomplished,"The author starts out with an excellent premise. She makes the reader take a closer look at decisions and the ethical problems they raise based on advancements in technology. Unfortunately, she reverts to a convoluted plot to show the reader that ""Mother Knows Best,"" and that life sucks, and then you die. The ending comes so forcefully, the reader cannot believe what happened. It is true that we lose people suddenly in our lives, and the shock value is much the same as how it happens in the book, but the whole story is lost in the ending. What starts out as a quest for pursuit of personal rights, ends up as a very sad commentary on life. Perhaps that's what the author wanted to do..... This was the first book I read by Jodi Picoult, and it will be the last book of hers that I will ever read."
4,Once Again!,"Jodi Picoult has been my favorite author since I read The Pact three years ago. I love how she draws you into the hearts and minds of all the characters. She always chooses complex and ethical topics for her stories, but she writes them beautifully. I could not put down My Sister's Keeper; It is a heartwrenching story of a girl with leukemia and her family's endless struggle to ease her affliction. If I am not mistaken, I believe Picoult based this plot along the lines of a true life story. I was genuinely touched by this novel, along with all the others. I was a little dismayed by the ending, as she throws a totally unexpected trauma to you, but still enjoyed it very much and recommended it to all of my friends. If you want a real, well-written, ethical and moral drama, this is for you."
4,My Sister's Keeper,This book was extremely well written. I enjoyed it tremendously although it was very sad. I recommend it highly and it is also a terrific book club selection as there is much to discuss both in the subject matter and writing style.
4,pretty predicable,"Am I the only one that saw this ending coming from a mile away?? I was disappointed. I thought it would be a lot more interesting to read another variety of resolution, if a family could ever achieve such a thing, under those circumstances.Other than the ending, I found the book compelling and thought-provoking."
1,Worst deus ex machina ever,"Ugh. I spent a gazillion hours reading this book. And those are hours that I am never going to get back,unfortunately.First of all, any good hospital would have put a stop to the sort of treatments that the younger daughter Anna, had to go through to save the life of her sister Kate who has leukemia. She is a child concieved to give her sister a match for bone marrow that she needs. People were horrified when her parents concieved her for that purpose. And then after suing her parents to be emancipated so she does not have to donate bone marrow ,in the end.....she's killed in a car accident and Kate gets Anna's kidney.Oh and can we talk about the cornball dialogue?Especially Campell's responses every time someone asks him why he has a guide dog(he's an epileptic-and he drives,he became a epileptic because of-oh irony- a car accident. Ane yet he still har a drivers licence? whut?)"
2,My sap's seeper,"Very interesting premise that will gain more relevance as we go further into the future. Unfortunately, totally marred by writer's rehearsed, un-spontaneous narrative that fed us sugar coated metaphors where none were needed. None of the characters ever get angry, disenchanted, frustrated and just plain old MEAN in the face of such a tragedy presented to them. That is not natural. Everyone knows that anger is a part of grieving process, but all of them seem to drift in the romantic mood musing about stars, fire, rain, zodiac and Greek mythology. Even if I give it lots of space in terms that everyone copes the way they best can, still none of them sounds human faced with such a tragedy. As if this is not enough- the end just totally enraged me. Oh, faith! How thee trickest us all! Again, interesting premise to contemplate on your own, weak book to draw you to any relevant conclusions."
3,"Enjoyed it, but a little disappointed.","This was a decent read, but I was a little disappointed by the ending, even though I believe I understand the author's point. (Ultimately, from a spiritual or divine position, we really have no control over life and/or death for that matter.) I still thought what happened to the heroine occurred rather abruptly and everything was ironed out way too quickly in the end. I understand the movie changed the ending (haven't seen it yet); I hope it's an improvement over the book. I like Ms. Picoult style, although I think I'll wait a while before picking up another one of her novels."
1,Cheap cheap story,"Seriously one the worst books I've read. I feel like the author didn't have the courage to follow the through with the story. I know she has said she had it planned out from the beginning but seriously, you are going to boil the whole story down to a random accident? Then in future everything is okay so don't get to glum... Cheap, why don't I just listen to a Brittney Spears song and eat some pop tarts while laying on some 50 thread count sheets to finish the experience.Honestly it would be like if at the end of the Joy Luck Club a meteor hit the town and vaporized the mothers, and sisters in China, then flashing forward and showing how that ironed everything out and made the daughters overcome their issues with their mothers. Seriously a cowardly writer, I don't think I will explore anymore of her work."
2,"At first compelling, but soon appalling","When I first started reading My Sister's Keeper, I was intrigued. I enjoyed the use of multiple voices. I thought Anna was sweet and Campbell the attorney was a cool guy. The family dynamics seemed realistic even. It was somewhere around page 150 that I started cringing and the bad metaphors. Around page 250 I was wondering what Campbell's romantic relationship possibly had to do with the story. At the 350 page mark I was reading because my book group wanted me to (luckily, it is an easy read, probably about 10th grade reading level). At the conclusion of 450 pages I hurled the book into the trash bin. The ending will appall you. The book is not well written, but worse it is inaccurate and irresponsible, especially the authors treatment of people with epilepsy."
1,I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS BOOK,"Characters are one-dimensional predictable. The legal scenes are improbable: no judge would have permitted Sara to represent herself. Honestly, Brian...could you please be any sappier? The ending ruined the entire story for me and I felt it was completely not necessary. Why the author decided to take the easy way out and wrap up the book is a question we should ponder. And what became of Jessie, I mean after the rain storm. I am sorry I wasted my time on this book."
1,So disappointing,"If i could give it no stars at all i would. Why? Most of the characters were irritating, especially the mother, Sara. The author threw in a soap opera romance that just seemed like its only purpose was to fill more pages. Don't get me started on the wordy astrological references that made you skim past half a page. The biggest issue I have with this book - WORST ENDING EVER!"
5,i couldn't put it down,"the book was amazing, i found myself wanting to hurry home so i could read it. a book hasn't done that for me in a long time. i'm going to read more, next on the list is second glance.i have a degree in molecular and cellular biology so this topic was very familiar to me and it was interesting to see it in a story. when you go to school for 4 years and learn just the science of it, it's hard to realize the ethics of the situation since it was never really discussedloved the book! i hope everyone finds as much enjoyment in it as i did."
