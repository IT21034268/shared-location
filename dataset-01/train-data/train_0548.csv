3,The core really 3 1/2,"Interesting and though provoking movie about the earths core and it stops spinning. Hilary Swank stars in this independence day action flick. Good things about this movie are the shots of Rome and San Frasico being destroyed and great shots going throught the earths core. The bad: a bit to long with running time of about 136 minutes. Hard to understand with all the Physical science equations that they do you cant really catch on. Interesting and ok film, a lot like Armegeddon"
5,Penetrate Deep Into Movie Greatness With 'The Core',"What a great movie, sexual tension you can cut with a geode, a giant geode at the center of the earth that is. Great acting, even better sci-fi realism. I never thought movies could be so great untill I saw the core."
1,Talented Actors in Lackluster Film,"I'm still wondering how so many talented actors got suckered into doing such a turkey of a movie. After watching the deleted scenes, I think they would have rounded out the characters more and made them more believable. But the science, puh-leeze! What a joke! (And not a funny joke) I'm glad this was a rental and I did not pay a hefty admission fee to see this."
1,"Digs it own grave, literally.","Impressive opening degrades in an almost quantam fashion. By 10 minutes into this film, disbelief can no longer be suspended and it becomes a comedy, though not intentionaly. The relationships of the characters to each other have an almost comic book feel. An analogy where a peach is roasted with a can of hairspray and a lighter is probably the best place to stop this movie and run out of your house and do something rather than waste your life watching the remainder of this film.It's not quite torture, but I think the U.N. should look into it."
1,"O, for the days of camp","When movies this bad were made in the 50s or 60s or 70s, they had The Cheese Factor. Effects were bad, acting was often pretty bad (with notable exceptions), and plots were happily implausible.And most of the time, people were on a jaunt. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" with James Mason et al? ""Hey, we can go to the center of the Earth! How about a picnic?""""At the Earth's Core"" with Peter Cushing and Doug McClure. Laughably bad effects and a plot based on accident make for a lot of cheesy fun.But now the effects are great (though not in this film) and budgets are greater, so the films must be Serious. And this film is so serious, so earnest. And SO BAD.Excellent actors, terrible picture."
1,Top 10 Worst Movies of All Time,What was it about this movie that I hated so much? Was it the horrible acting? Was it the unbelievably stupid storyline? Was it the B-rate special effects?It was all of the above. Don't waste your money.
3,A good popcorn flick,The movie and its premise are far fetched but if you want to be taken away from reality for a few hours then this is a decent enough movie.I wont give it more then 3 stars simply because the science they based the movie on was way over the top.
3,lots of fun and good effects!,"this was an enjoyable flick with great special effects and a solid cast - pure entertainment - if you are truly into science and reality I don't suggest this but otherwise expect to be entertainedand a sidenote - I can't seem to find a CD compilation for this movie but there was a killer song on it called ""echelon"" that I lovedthis is a great rental or one to own - it is on the long side and you will catch new things each time you watch itenjoy!"
3,It's a summer movie ...,"I'm not really sure how to critique a movie that never really aspires to do anything more then what's already been done before.That said, it was made in the same mold as Independence Day, Armageddon, the list could go on forever. If you liked one, you'll probably like the other.What it has is a believable, although ridiculous, plot, a decent performance by the cast, and pretty good special effects. It's a pop-corn movie in the true mold of one. If you're expecting ANYTHING else you're wasting your time. If all you want is a mildly interesting action movie to kill two hours, you could certainly do a lot worse."
4,Intresting and unique but not stellar,"A disaster movie with a twist; it's not some new deadly virus threatening the human race or a giant space rock about to hit the plant but, rather, the planet itself (with some...human help). The Earth's molten core has stopped spinning, causing massive electrical storms and a host of other problems that will, ultimately, result in the demise of the third rock from the sun. A group of scientists devise a way to restart the core and save the planet. I like it! Something new and potentially fun!It doesn't have a particularly standout cast but they pull of their rolls very well indeed. Some of the science behind what has happened and the solutions to it is quite flaky but, hey, it's a movie. If you're looking for a new sort of disaster movie to get your thrills from, this is it, but there's just something about it that I can't give it that 5th star."
3,"okay, too 'scientific'","this movie seems to much like a remake of the 1998 blockbuster Armageddon. the same exact concept is reused, with much less fun. it's not a brainless and silly as Armageddon, and there's too much blathering about science. But there are some amazing action sequences, which is why I gave this film 3 stars. My favorite scene is the Golden Gate bridge blowing up. but somebody, please tell Hilary 'Horseface' Swank that she is ugly and cannot act!"
1,This is such a terrible movie,"I felt like five years of my life were drained after I watched this movie. It is unbelievably bad. Not so because of the acting, or other things, however. What makes this movie so detestable is the fact that almost nothing makes any sense at all. OK, so the core of the earth is going to explode, so why the heck did they jump in a shuttle and go to outer space? There's even one scene where hundreds of thousands of pigeons drop dead and plummet to the ground, causing chaos. Who thought that one up? If that scene was supposed to be scary, it wasn't because I couldn't stop laughing. And of course noone would notice a man who had harnessed the power to blast through mountains. And who would've thought that only the two main characters would make it out alive. Oh, please....."
2,Rent It Before You Buy It.,"You Know I Liked This Movie But The Special Effects Ar WorseThan You Exept. And The Camera Work Is Just Plain Bad,And Ebert&Ropert; Gave It 2 Thumbs Down Id Give It 2 Thumbs Down To.I Mean Come On You Go On A mISSION With 15 Crew Members And Only 2 Survive .2/5 Stars"
2,The longer you watch the more ridiculous it gets,"The most entertaining thing about this movie is watching good actors pretend that they are in an actual good film. Poor humorless Hilary Swank, she is just an earnest in this as everything else. Stanley Tucci at least plays up being the jackass. The acting is surprisingly good considering just how bad the writing is. Even the effects are ok. But as this movie goes along it just moves from one crazy idea to the next. I should have caught on as to how out of control this movie would be when they landed the space shuttle in the L.A. River."
2,"I really wanted to ""LIKE"" The Core, it's lame to THE CORE !","Look...I've learned, to enjoy any of these Hollywood Blockbusters, it is wise to accept a certain amount of movie logic. Without doing so, movies can drive one crazy on common since issues alone. Since I've taken on the philosophy of allowing some movie logic breathing room and without questioning it's common since, I have truly enjoyed movies much more. After all, movies are an escape right? So a little silliness is okay.With that said, The Core is not only full of movie logic, The Core is full of lame twists and turns that fall short of any enjoyable entertainment! While the special effects are fantastic, they cannot carry this film to quality movie status.I tried very hard to like this movie. In fact, I really wanted to like it because I love end of the world movies. I just can't, in good conscience, recommend this film. It's lame...to THE CORE."
3,"A modern day, dumbed down Journey To The Center of the Earth","I'm not a big scientist, but even I found a lot of flaws in the logic they were using. So, don't expect to be wowed by its intellictual value.This film reminds me of ""Armageddon"" and ""Independance Day"" so if you liked those movies, you will probably like this one. Not quite as entertaining as those two, but I would say it was just about there."
3,Mindless but fun entertainment,This film surprised me. I thought it would be a predictable Hollywood 'Armageddon' type movie but it was reasonably well-acted and fairly entertaining. What surprised me was that the government scientist wasn't such a bad guy after all and there was no romantic sub-plot between Hillary Swank's character and the College Prof.
3,"""We're dodging diamonds the size of Cape Cod!""","The above line spoken by Oscar winner Hilary Swank is indicative of the dialog in this special effects driven sci-fi saga. Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's ""studly"" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.The film is passable entertainment.I just kept waiting for the discovery of an underground ""civilization"" that might have been responsible for all the above ground havoc."
4,Great entertainment,"This movie gave me the same feeling as Independence Day. Yes it is far fetched! But that is entertainment. There are neat effects and a decent story line. The difference between this and other ""successes"" is a lesser known cast. This movie is worth a watch!"
2,Armageddon....UPSIDE DOWN!!!,"I'm just a simple country girl but...can the earth's core really be ""jump-started""??? Ok let's say that I bought the idea of this stupid thought for a mere moment...then I have to ask myself can a crew of people really survive in a ""spaceship"" type vehicle going so many miles per hour in the hottest and most pressurized environment on the planet, let alone get out of the ship and walk around in it??? Who writes this! Anyway, this movie interested me but only because of it's incredibly unbelieveable plot and situations (and because I loved Armageddon and let's face it...The Core is Armageddon switched upside down)."
4,"Quite, quite enjoyable!","It's ""fantasy,"" folks - f-a-n-t-a-s-y. Have FUN with it! - the actors certainly are. Just think of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" ""Fantastic Voyage,"" ""Crack In The World,"" and you'll be in the right spirit.And by the way, ""The Core"" is a rare example of a recent Hollywood film where the deleted scenes are actually worth watching, and would contribute significantly if they were plugged back into the film. I'd vote for a Director's Cut, but it's probably too late by now."
3,The Core-Just OK,"The Core was just OK at three stars. I agree with most reviewers that this film was not hard sci-fi, but had some nice ideas, good CGI and fine performances. I don't think there is enough there to warrant several viewings.Note, that the term ""unobtainium alloy"" referred to in the plot was widely used by many engineers (at least) since 1971 when I heard it jokingly referred to at P&WA;'s materials research & development lab (MRDL). It was probably coined and used years ago by other engineers and scientists and the author did not originate this cute handle."
1,What and you're surprised!,"These debunkers are saying this was a ham and that it was really stupid, but what were they expecting when they saw the preview, that practically gave it away. I knew from the start that this would be a terrible movie and I only saw the preview. I refuse to watch this...at least until it comes on network television. Skip this, there are better movies out there."
2,Quite primitive,I have seen probably thousands of movies like this. Nothing new. Boring. Wasted my two hours. I gave it two stars just for visual efects that are not bad.
1,Impossible phyics,One really needs to see this film in order to see impossible situations over and over again.1.) the 'scientist' needs to pic up a piece of fruit and hold a can of lyscal and set fire to the fruit. Why? The generals didn't get to were they are due to stupidity. All he needed to do was explain it instead of puling an elementary school display.2.) How does the ship fall about a mile and still be intact.3.) They fail time and time again during training yet avoids huge diamonds successfully4.) They wind up at the bottom of the ocean yet the navy can find and rescue them even though they haven't mastered this in real life.5.) Why do they need some computer nerd to save the day above ground?6.) How do the US military (of course) manage to stop the core from moving with a few bombs just to duplicate it the same way?This isn't even interesting to watch for the special effects.
4,Interesting movie,"First saw this movie on TV, it was an interesting movie and was enjoyable, could this ever happen? who knows but some of the sceneswere really good."
4,The Core,"The Core is an excellent Movie. I was happy with the quickness in which I received my order, and the wonderful condition it was in. Thank you."
4,"super silly,but great cast makes it work when it shouldn't","this is one goofy movie about the world coming to an end and only our heros can save us.this time the earth's core has stoped spining and very soon the electromagnetic field of the earth will deteriorat and the earth will be no more.sound like something you've seen before? sure a million times before,in a million other disaster movies,but a first rate cast and some great f/x sell this story and make it more fun than it should be.first the cast hilary swank, aaron eckhart, delroy lindo,stanley tucci, and even alfre woodard show up. these are a list actors maybe looking for that hit money maker to boost their boxoffice draw,no matter because they make this super thin plot take on a life of it's own and draw you into the movie.the f/x are great and if you let it, this super silly movie is fun in the way all the great old disaster movies were. give it a try."
5,Awesome,"If you like visual effects such as in the movies like The Terminator, The Cell, Aliens and Deep Blue Sea etc, then this movie is for you. It also has a great plot to save the Earth and the mankind, very scientifically based. There is also no place better than Amazon to buy it from."
3,"A silly, but absurdly fun movie","This is a movie that you know (or should know) the instant it starts, that it's going to be far-fetched. But, at least this one manages to be fun to watch, for the most part that is.Unless you're completely new to disaster films (or films in general, for that matter), you should know exactly how this one's going to go. The Core is a mix of Armageddon and Deep Impact.The casting is the best part about the Core. The cast is brilliant, led by Aaron Eckart (Possession) and Hilary Swank (Insomnia). But it's the supporting actors that steal the show in this one. In that list would be Bruce Greenwood (Below), Delroy Lindo (Heist) and Stanley Tucci (Maid in Manhattan, Big Trouble), who really makes this one good.BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for an old-fashioned (and quite long) night at the movies with more great special effects than dialogue, than this is your ticket."
5,A WILD RIDE!,"I liked this move, the whole concept is that the core of the earth has stopped rotating and we as mankind are about to die.Thus, the government comes up with top-notch scientists and avaitors to solve the problem. How? By a big old craft that can burrow down to the core,withstand heat that is hot as hell,literally (perhaps they are going through hell?) and restart the planet's engine, so to speak.I loved the actors, especially D.J. Quall who played the cyber-nerd and I liked how they added some comic relief through a very serious problem.The graphics were great bringing you right along with the crew and my favorite scene was the singing whales. Wonderful! All in all this movie to me was entertaining in a big way, pulled at my heartstrings when many of the crew members were lost and ended with me having a chuckle at the antics of our cyber-nerd! Good job! Good movie!"
1,*Sigh* Another End of the World Movie,"There is not much to say about this movie. The plot is bad, it is to fake. Save your money, you could see a better movie."
2,dumb and formulaic,"If you've seen Armageddon,you've already seen this. Throw in some Fantastic Voyage, and that's pretty much it. I didn't care about the bad science -- everything else was weak. Not just the story, script, and acting, but the special effects as well. Lots of boring cliches here, too -- nerdy kid computer genius (who has a remarkably ugly nose by the way), unethical scientist who knows something everybody else doesn't, fish-out-of-water good guy suddenly conscripted to save the day, good black guy who dies. Plus, famous landmarks get destroyed! The only part of the movie that worked for me was the opening scene, where pigeons go nuts because of some disturbance in the Earth's electromagnetic field and start crashing into everything. That set up a creepy feeling of dread that this End Of The World flick should have, but did not, maintain throughout."
1,PURE TORTURE!!!,"Giving it 1 star is giving it way to much credit. This is a promising cannidate and possible winner of worst movie of the year, and is definatly one of the most painful movies I've ever sat through, and I watch everything. Not too often does a film torture me, but in the last week I've been tortured by two movies, last week's View From The Top, and now The Core which is an hour longer, which makes it the worse of the 2 movies, STAY AWAY!!"
1,"The Core? Perhaps ""The Pit"" Would Be More Apropos","I can't remember when I've seen a movie with such BAD SCIENCE, perhaps it was one of those 50's creature features. Maybe if they spent some of that precious special effects money on a science advisor they could have made something a little more believable."
5,Definitely something to see!,"I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about--I thought this was a great movie! Yes, you have to suspend reality a little, but you have to do that for ALL movies, especially sci-fi action movies. The dialog was humurous in places, no knee-slapping jokes, but chuckles were definitely had, and delighted chuckles at that!The special effects showing the storms and destruction on the surface were good, but I thought that the effects below the surface were more interesting. The characters were real for the most part (there was one part where, instead of explaining or defending herself, Hillary Swank's character just stared) and made the story interesting.All in all, this movie worked for me. I'll be pre-ordering it on DVD as soon as I can."
1,Try Core of wooden acting....,"If the preposterious story does not make you turn it off, the wooden acting will. Everyone in this movie has less personality and less humanity then a pair of wooden oak trees. The dialoge is delivered with as little credit as a poor salesman selling you something in a cheap TV add."
2,Oh Boy,"Hillary Swank went from ""Boys Don't Cry"" to this? Looking for a money making blockbuster ay?The latest in special effects natural disaster movies..I disagree with others and refuse to rave about the cheesy effects in this film. I do agree it is smarter than ""Armegeddon"" and can be fun as ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth""..But you can guess with accuracy who will survive and who will die.I loved the Geode scene however. I laughed how the ship just popped out of an ocean vent at the end ...Good for mind numbing entertainment. I still don't understand Hillary's interest in this project."
5,the perfect fit,"This hat was just what I was looking for, real quality cloth and an adjustable head band."
4,Great products,"Their products are good quality and VERY reasonably priced. The apron was out of stock, even though it said it was in stock when I placed the order so I was a little dissapointed however I emailed and they immediately helped me select another apron so they could fill my total order. The contact person at the vendor was very polite and nice about the order. The merchandise arrived and it is fantastic. Very good quality for the price. I will order from them again."
2,took too long,"finally received product. product was good, and what i expected. package was lost in shipping process and took over a month to receive. sort of puts a damper on the whole gift idea."
2,AN EXTREMELY O.K. BOOK,"This book wasn't a yawner, but it wasn't a page turner. Sorely unrealistic, this book was good for bed time reading as it woud not keep you awake. On the good side, there were no slopy ends that were just tied up to end the book. If you are looking for a nice book this will work."
1,just want it finished,"While I like Admission and the White Rose, I found A Jury of Her Peers pedantically long and tiresome. I just want the book finished when I was a third through it. The whole book felt like she just wants to teach you something about the law through her story, which is extremely tiring. Thank goodness it's her earlier books and thus that means she's gotten better with the white rose and admission."
5,Very comprehensive...a must for the Japanese student!,"This pictorial dictionary is incredible. After trying to work with lots of little, imported Japanese dictionaries, I find this dictionary both useful and fun to look at! The layout of the pictures let you find the Japanese word for something even if you don't know what it is called in English!"
1,Waste of money and time,I found this book to be completely useless. Having pictures for things I already knew was not helpful at all. The alphabetized list of nouns in the back was the only useful section of the book.
5,Tracie keeps getting better........,"this is the third book in the lake emily series and i hope it won't be the last. i am truly a devoted fan of tracie now. this book makes you laugh,cry and feel warm inside. if you haven't read any of tracies books i recommend a can of peas and dandelions in a jelly jar. they are equally wonderful. great reading!!!!!!"
3,Beautiful? Derivative.,"There's nothing about this album (The Walter Eugenes' second) that I really hate, but there's nothing that gets me excited, either. It's derivative from start to finish, sounding for all the world like Charlie Peacock doing an impression of Simple Minds. Unfortunately, the lyrics don't rise to the level of either. The one possible exception is ""Crawl"", which has some tasty guitar work and manages to break out of the mold a bit, but I'm not sure that's enough reason to recommend buying the album."
4,"Great, but slower than you remember","The Prisoner was a great series, and these were entertaining and important episodes. Just bear in mind, like Nightstalker, or Man From Uncle, or other series that you recall fondly, the actual episodes can be slower and less involving than you remember. Just saying."
1,Under Suspicion Soundtrack/BT connection,"Just as Kristina stated in her review, this soundtrack can be very misleading. If you were captivated by sensual haunting theme through out the movie, it isn't on the soundtrack. The link you are looking for is by the artist BT who does many other well known soundtracks. I have been unable to pin point the exact cd this music is on, but if you want to do the searching yourself, the song is called ""Chantel's Theme"". Good Luck!"
1,Chantal's Theme song finally found!!!!!,"Very disapointed with the soundtrack, and gave up on finding Chantal's theme song. But then the other day i was listening to Massive Attack's cd ""Collected"", which BTW is a great cd,and when i heard the song titled ""Teardrop"" i realized it's that theme song, so enjoy :)"
1,Is it the same movie?!?,"When I saw Under Suspicion, I heard an excellent down-beat music that realy depicted the movie's gloomy atmosphere. I was eager to hear the soundtrack. And - it is not good. It has some latin tracks that were in the background of the movie and not very good ones too. and so, all disappointed I can say - this CD [stinks]. No wander, no one else wrote review, it's not worth the bother."
1,Not the best tunes by a long shot.,"I had hoped this CD contained the hauting intro music to the movie Under Suspicion with the inimitable Monica Belluci, but no. Someone posted that BT does this and the title is ""Chantel's Theme"" but so far I have been unable to find the single on iTunes or anywhere else. If anyone has any ideas they would be welcome. For others, avoid this CD unless you are in the mood for some uninspiring, unknown Latin diddys."
5,Still have it,"I received this book when I was about 5 years old and even after almost 14 years, I still have it. Granted, my copy of the book is now in very bad shape, but I still filp through the pages from time to time. It's story is still funny and appealing to me even through all these years, and helps me cool down when I'm stressed up with my assignments. Furthermore, It's the only book from my childhood days that is still with me. I would certainly recommend this book to parents who are looking for a good book of bedtime stories for their siblings."
2,abridged,My 10 year old grandson gave his copy to my 2 year old grand-daughter.It was in very bad shape with the cover split off from the book.I went on line to buy a newer version of the much loved book.What I received was an abridged version. I had no idea this wasgoing to be a much shorter book. I was very disappointed. Buyer beware!!
4,not Richard Scarry's best,"I'm a Richard Scarry fan, but this book isn't his best (I recommend ""What Do People Do All Day?"", ""Cars and Trucks and Things That Go,"" and ""Richard Scarry's Biggest Book Ever"" instead). The pictures are, of course, great and full of detail, and most of the stories are amusing for young children, but I don't like the text -- it sounds dated and stiff, and in some cases is a bit too harsh (criminal characters who have to be ""punished,"" etc.) If I read the stories to my son in my own words we enjoy the book more. (Well, he would probably enjoy it no matter what the words were!)"
3,This is an abridged edition!,"The original Funniest Storybook Ever is chock-full of toddler pleasing tales, but be aware that this listing seems to lump together abridged and unabridged editions. It's hard to tell which one you're ordering. I bought the abridged one without realizing, and was disappointed at the slim volume."
5,Excellent,"If you can find this book buy it. Your kids will love it and as an adult the stories are pretty funny. This book is not available as a reprint so you'll need to go the used route - so you'll have to live with a ""pre-loved"" copy. Still worth it."
4,Great Value!,"Any fan of the Blue Series should definately get the DVD over the VHS. This volume contains the last 6 episodes of the series (21-26), and includes both the Japanese w/ subtitle and English Dubbed versions of the show! Considering single episodes on VHS are the same price, you just can't do wrong with the Blue Seed DVD."
2,Washington Huskies Car Mats,I received these Washington Huskies Mats for my car and one of them was torn so I contacted the company and asked them if they could send me one and I would send the torn one back. They e-mailed me back and apologized and said they didn't have any more of them. I feel they should have offered my a discount since of of them was torn. Oh well I won't be purchasing anything from them again.
1,superflous materials BUY THE ORIGINAL ALBUMS!,"the whole songs have been already appeared in the Remastered album,...think about it Buddy! before you buy it,..."
1,"Pointless, again","Let me get this straight. Plant refuses to give Page the go ahead to compile a series of live/outtakes anthologies, but allows these things? The fans were always there for Zep and the fans want a comprehensive anthology of unreleased material. Until then, skip this and look for bootlegs."
2,"Latter Days: Best of Led Zeppelin, Vol.2","The producers of this Album should be shot! This is an obvious ploy to try and squeeze a little extra money out of Zeppelen Fans. This is a travesty. I am considered by many a ""Zeppelen Expert"" I own ALL of there Albums (with the exception of this one). I have traveled all across the USA to see their concerts. I strongly recommend for those who seek true Zeppelen Bliss, purchase the box set. Get more Led for your head, and you won't be disappointed!"
2,commercial band!,"Led Zep was a good band, but this cd is becoming very commercial. I like hard rock music but not like this compilation! because many fans'd already owned the original Lp's."
3,Not as good as Early days,"Beside tracks 4, 5, 6 and 9, I would leave most of these tracks out of a ""Best of..."" CD. But those 4 songs are 4 of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and I guess 4 good songs on one CD is ok. The rest are good, just not amazing."
3,Not for truth fans,"This and Early Days are not for real fans. These two Greatest Hits are good for simply introducing people to Led Zeppelin. To get the real scope of Led Zeppelin, buy either the Complete Studio Recordings or the 4-CD box set."
2,money maker!!!,yes I think so. there are no new songs on this compilation/ best of. Only some old songs from their old LP's had been taken during the 70's Hey day.
2,money for nothing,"I'm sure that this band is the most commercial rock band in the hrock history. I know the band had been demised in the 80's, and the musicians went to get their own solo projects. But this compilation is a superfulous cd, because the fans know that the band musicians are still depends on money. Robert plant and Jimmy Page needed alot of money for their tax or revenue office . That is similar like PINK FLOYD the WALL re-released cd."
2,Too Short,"Houses Of The Holy - how can you eliminate anything at all from that. Buy the original. Physical Graffiti was a two record set,to sum it up in 3 songs is impossible.Prescence and In Through The Out Door,well a couple from each of those is all they warrant. Overall a failure as an anthology."
2,the musicians are depends on money,"This compilation has symbolized the commercial rock band of all time. ZEPPELIN was a good band, but many people have bought the original Lp's in the seventies. WHY THIS NEW RELEASED AGAIN? The songs are not different....."
2,Why (Again)?,"Just as in my review of Vol. One, the only way to release a greatest hits collection from these guys was to do it over six discs like they already did."
3,Leaves off some important stuff,"Like the Early Days CD, this is chock full of fine rock music. However, you won't hear some of their staple songs such as ""D'yer Ma'ker"" or ""Dancing Days,"" and you'll also miss out on oft-overlooked gems like ""The Rover"" and ""Candy Store Rock."" A better way to experience Led Zeppelin is to listen to the original albums one by one, or at least through the 4-Disc remasters set."
2,Too incomplete . . .,"10 songs from the last 4 records just is not going to do it. The major flaws here are:(1) The inclusion of ""The Song Remains the Same"" and ""No Quarter"", which are definitely the strongest or most memorable tracks from 'Houses of the Holy' (1973) (such as ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""The Ocean"", ""Dancing Days"", or ""D'yer Mak'er"").(2) The inclusion of 10+ minute ""Achilles Last Stand"" from the weakest record, 'Presence' (1976), could have been replaced with 2-3 much better, more memorable songs from other records (""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""The Ocean"", ""Dancing Days"", ""D'Yer Mak'er"", ""Fool in the Rain"", or ""In the Evening"").Save the money from purchasing these two compilations and spend the money on the complete recordings and make your own compilation."
3,Best of vs Greatest Hits,"I would prefer a greatest hits disc or discs, since some of their biggest hits are ommitted. Still a lot of great music."
3,Led Zeppelin-Latter Days,"I thought that this album was okay but missed A LOT of songs that should have been included. It was not as good as Early Days, Vol I. It is a must for any Zeppelin fan!"
3,3/4 of the Thunder,"This one is a bit of a let down after the near perfect programing of the EARLY DAYS comp. Surely it would have made more sense to include the best tracks off of 'Houses of the Holy' and done without 11 minutes of ""Archilles Last Stand""... But, it does provide a good purchasing option, in that it doesn't seem redundant to buy 'Houses of the Holy' along with this... The songs from 'Physical Graffiti' are exactly the ones I would have picked (""Houses of the Holy"", ""Trampled Underfoot"", ""Kasmir"") and the later selections are good enough. (I do like ""Archilles Last Stand""). The book of photos is wonderful."
3,Great Music but...,"The music in this CD is some of the very best rock music ever written and performed, but Led Zeppelin's material doesn't fit the ""greatest hits"" package. Zeppelin is one of the pioneers of album rock, so the songs here sound better in their original context, the studio albums. Maybe this two volumes, ""Early days"" and ""Latter days"", are a fair introduction for the people who doesn't have an idea of who were Led Zeppelin and are not willing to buy all the albums, but the albums are the ideal way to start with Zeppelin. Bands like Led Zeppelin and Queen have been repackaged over and over (Just take a look at Queen Greatest Hits III and you'll see.) Zeppelin should release some live performances, studio outtakes, rarities... like the BBC Sessions, which was appealing to long time fans and new fans as well. The music here is excelent, but the disc is useless for long time fans."
2,DESERVES A MUCH BETTER EXAMPLE,"Because D'yer Mak'er, The Ocean and Fool In The Rain (to name only a few) aren't available on this CD, it's obvious neither surviving Zeppelin members nor advocate followers are getting their share of what's best about this monumental R'nR band. In relatively brief summarization, 10 songs put on a greatest hit disc is pretty slack material for any retrospective compilation no matter what the tunes' length are or may be.Do us all better credit Jimmy/Robert/John Paul and next time (if ever there is one) please don't offer your fans a queasy aftertaste about what accurately represents the great Led Zeppelin. Sure many substantial tracks are included on this anthology, but definitely not enough to properly characterize the group's Latter `Years` by any convincing means..."
1,should be titled best of led zeppelin part two,"One person said below that this best of belongs to the aim of the record company to be a money maker, but for die hard fans are acceptable.On the other hand some people love this cd, but not for the LP original collectors.I don't even care I'm not a huge ZEP fan,.....if Plant and Page still need a money for their tax office rules. Please buy this one! and give the money to them."
2,DIAGNOSIS--UNATTACHED MOTHER,"I am a mother of a three year old boy with the spectrum disorder of autism. I could not wait to read this book because of the ""miracle"" title. Halfway through, I realized the mother was the one with major issues. Ms. Steils position was a difficult one having one daughter with leukemia and the other with autism. I was extremely dissapointed to see how long it took her to bond with Georgie. She was institutionalised and labled and slipped through the loops so to say as her mom fought for her sanity. In this broken and torn apart family it's a wonder to even say Georgie could have been saved sooner if more time and effort were given to her. Very sad and depressing tale of a mother who never had a clue as to what her daughter needed the most --her."
5,I felt connected with the author!,"When you are the parent of a child with Autism, it's difficult to make people understand what is going on with that child. Friends and family, although well meaning, just can't possibly understand the big picture! Reading her book was like having my own private support group. As I read of her self-doubt as a parent and later realizing that her parenting had nothing to do with Georgie's issues, I cheered for her. I thought ""Yes, I'm not the only one who has felt this way""!The sections focusing on Georgie's successful treatment with AIT also gave me some hope for the future with my own child, as her symptoms are eerily similar to Georgie's.A ""must read"" for parents and caregivers!"
2,It is mostly the story of the life of the Author,"At first, I thought: ""Here is another book, where I will not learn anything different from what I had read from other books"". In fact, I did learn about auditory integration therapy. This therapy does make a difference in an autistic child life. In reading a book on autism, I expected to learn more about the person affected with autism not about the parent's story life. I really want to have a follow-up on the life of the autistic child. Is there any book written by Annabelle Stehli's daughter. If so, I wish to read it. It might be a very interesting and beneficial book. If not, why didn't she do so. Because according to a mother, she seems quite normal, why can't she write her own story."
3,Thats Ok! It's a Good score!,"It's a score that you must be pay attention, and listen many times... A SHORT Score, too short... ''Vera's World'', ''Eclipse'' and ''End Credits'' are the highlight of this score... Overall, it's a good music..."
3,An OK flick that had great potential,"Using Bram Stokers name seems to have been a good selling point for this movie. Pity it failed to live up to the hype. The special effects surrounding the demon at times were exceptional, but they just didn't create the atmosphere and tension to follow up with it. What resulted was a creature that generally looked good, but just didn't come across as something to fear. I think they failed to realise the basic formula for a good horror (show the creature as little as possible), and seemed to throw him on screen more than he was off it. Sadly, though the script was quite good, some of the acting failed to bring it across well. What remained was a wanna-be-horror that was just good, and nothing more."
2,An okay flick for the horror-challenged.,"The first half of the movie is filled with an almost creepy excitement. The 'Shadowbuilder' lurks just beyond the protective barrier of light like some demonic Lovecraftian horror. But, ironically, it is the very appearance of the creature as it steps into the light that catapults this movie straight to the video shelf. The acting was standard and unmemorable and, though visually exciting, the ending was predictable. An annoying Rastafarian junkman (ala Jar Jar Binks) is entirely out of place and contributed nothing to the plot of this supposed horrorfest."
3,its O.K,the truth its that this doll is very delicated cuz her legs are really skiny an tuff her hair its not very normal it falls down a lot her face its pretty but the hair goes up with long time and the stomach wont long be movable so its ok if u buy it.
5,Very COOL!!,My Daughter Just Loves This Barbie!! This silver pants and the Fushia Jacket are Very COOL and Fashionable for this Barbie doll!!
2,My sister has it and her hair is all messed up,My sister got this for her b-day and her hair is a giant mess from changing it from pink to brown her bangs are all tangled up and her shirt doesn't stay tied.It just makes her frustrated and she throws it down and forgets about it.
4,Sophomore Jinx?,"I originally bought ""Knife"" on CD back in 1986, listened to it initially, and put it away without much thought. It's not that I did not like the album; I just was not enamored with it. Recently, I dug it out of storage and gave it a fresh listen and have completely changed my mind. Roddy Frame's sophomore effort as front man/songwriter/guitarist/singer of Aztec Camera is truly a wonderful work. Frame's songwriting is more complex than on his debut ""High Land, Hard Rain"" and the songs benefit greatly from Mark Knopfler's production. The addition of keyboards to fun, upbeat tracks like ""Still On Fire,"" ""Just Like The USA,"" and ""All I Need Is Everything"" do not detract from Frame's playful guitar work, nor does the trumpet work on ""Head Is Happy"". The other tracks are on the mellow side but are well written and a pleasure to listen to. Most importantly, this CD is timeless. It does not sound dated in any respect. I am glad I rediscovered this CD think you'll find it a strong effort."
5,Best laymans book on raisinging children,"I have read several dozen books on raising children. This is not to say the other books were not worth it but this is the book I suggest above all. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a child psychologist. This book sums up my own philosophy on raising children into individuals who are respectful, self reliant and a wonder to be around."
3,"Some good ideas, but....","I own lots of books for parents and this one covers information I've seen everywhere else. It does have some good ideas, but there are also some rigid suggestions that made me uncomfortable. The author's been on Oprah, so I think the book has gotten more press than it deserves.Also recommended: Hidden Messages: What Our Words and Actions are Really Telling Our Children -- Kid Cooperation: How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading -- Positive Discipline for Teenagers -- The 10 Greatest Gifts I Give My Children"
1,Blasphemous!,"Upon a closer examination of the rudimentary design of this ""how-to"" book for selfish parents, you will see that this essay has been misconstrued completely by the author, Sal Severe (who happens to be one of the most un-hip trendsetters of all time, but that's another story). Halfway into this puff piece for the esoteric agenda, one will find himself or herself wallowing in a morass of self-despair, for none of Severe's teachings follows a divine discipline; no consequent follows a feasible supposition. To make matters worse, Severe completely ignores the need for self-reflection and motivational critique. Furthermore, the complete lack of phenotypic characterizations leaves the reader asking, ""why, Mr. Severe, do you affix such a post-generational disjunctive grappling hook (line, and sinker) to the cold-hearted buffoon?"" Save your money."
3,watering cans,"I purchased 4 of these watering cans. Three were OK, but the 4th started leaking within 3 weeks of receipts."
1,Lacking Philosophical Acumen,"Heidegger scholars pretty much unanimously agree that Edwards completely missed the boat on this one. He takes ""death"" at face value and ignores Heidegger's clear warnings in Being and Time that this should not be done."
3,Horrible footage,- Tommy played out of sequence- Parts of the video are chopped and out of frame. There cannot be much excuse about the technology (or lack of it) as the one performed by Jimi Hendrix (at Wight 1970) seems lot betterI am still giving 3 stars as this is the best you can get of a historic rock event performed by a great band.
4,Excellent Keith Moon video,"Having seen The Who live and in concert with Keith Moon on drums I was a happy guy when I started watching this concert video. Considering the fact that this video was shot in 1970, and outdoors too, the audio is excellent. But back to Keith. I was about 50 or so yards away from Keith Moon when I saw the band and he was, and forever shall be, the most amazing rock drummer. The Who: Live At The Isle Of Wight features many great scenes and tight shots of Keith in action. This DVD also includes a very in-depth interview with Pete Townshend that was surprising and interesting since I thought I knew this band fairly well. The only down side to this concert, in my humble opinion, was Pete's performance. If you are expecting ""The Who - Live At Leeds"" Townshend guitar perfection it's not here. There are moments of classic Townshend greatness however and overall this is still an excellent Who concert but it's sloppy at times."
3,Special Edition,"I agree with most posters that the Special Edition is the one to get. I LOVE Blue Ray but not when its cuts things and makes a good thing less desirable, I'll stay with my Special Edition as the new remix isn't that different also :)"
5,"Five stars, yes, but DON'T BUY IT","Yes, this is an incredible Who concert. No, don't buy it. Make sure you buy the ""special edition"" instead because it contains two songs inexplicably cut from this release: ""Substitute"" and ""Naked Eye"". It says it's the complete concert. They're lying. The special edition isn't the complete concert, either, but at least it's all of the existing footage. The double CD set contains the entire concert. It's a shame that ""Amazing Journey/Sparks"" apparently was not filmed or has been lost. The performance of it on the CD set is extraordinary.Screw Eagle Rock Entertainment and Murray Lerner for me having to buy this concert yet again just to get two songs that, by your own product's description, should have been included from the beginning. Your soaking of hardcore fans like myself is deplorable."
4,This is History,"I have watched this DVD a number of times, and what I like most about it is that allows me to witness a part of Rock and Roll history. The Who concert at Isle of Wight; 600,000 people, 2am, 4 guys and lots of amplifiers. The Who was a mega band, and in this concert they perform on a stage as if they were playing at the high school gym. The band members are all on the same level and close enough to communicate with their eyes.Also, there were no other musicians on stage. I am always disappointed at live performances with 10+ people on stage. I want to see the band, and only the band, perform.Lastly, for those people that complain about the sound quality, the editing and the absence of other songs - the glass is half full, so drink up if your thirsty for rock and roll history!"
3,Not as advertised,"First of all, even on the record, i don't think that this was by any means one of The Who's best shows. Compare 'young man blues' to the version on Live at Leeds. This was an off night.Then the absolutely horrific butchering by the editors of the Tommy material. What were they thinking? Drove me up the wall. Just awful.All and all, 3 stars because it's the greatest live band (by far) there has ever been in rock history, but really a shoddy production. The people who put this thing together should be embarrassed."
3,Better picture and sound,"Just saw this on INHD. Same old video but a much better picture and sound. However, still out of sync and many shots are not of the songs that are being played. This must be the video that started it all with regards to how camera angles are constantly changing and is so confusing that you want to yell at the tv, ""Can you please stay with one shot for more than a half second, please?"" Still, it's Moonie at his best. And also what kind of show The Who could put on at their height. Sure puts those robots called 'Led Zeppelin' to shame when it came to stage presence."
4,Better than expected quality,"One of the other reviewers above said something like, ""if you think the Live at Leeds album is the Who at it's best, then this is a must own."" I couldn't agree more. I dinged it one star for not including the song 'Amazing Journey'. Great stuff."
1,WHO?,"The only reason for 1 star is, I never got the DVD. The vender sent me a CD instead, I received a refund so maybe I purchase it later. I've seen some of the performance before, and what I saw was really good."
4,No Extras but Good,"Some people say this DVD is not so good 'cause some audio is not nsync with the footage, but I didn't really care, I didn't like the first set, I think is 'cause I'm not a big fan of the who, but I did like the rendition of some of the songs of TOMMY. If you like tommy buy this, but if not, well, you'll miss it."
2,not the who: more like what? here:,": dont get this dvd; it has lousy sound q. only bad thing about this is u cant hear pete townsends guitar. even best buy employees tested it & said: yeah-lousy sound q. how can this b? vs. others reviews ive seen here about its sound. also, i wanna hear the who do the song called ""DOGS""."
3,The great film that could have been....,"The performance is great but the editing is horrible and the photography isn't much better. This could have been an outstanding jewel in the WHO film collection if the production was more professional. Of course, WHO fans should buy this one anyway because....well...it's the WHO....live!"
2,Great Concert-Terrible Film,"We have here what could have been the ultimate document of a Moon-era Who show but instead get a concert film that is barely watchable. Not only is song order altered and numbers deleted, but some of the songs themselves are actually edited down. Also, the presentation really needs to be in letterbox format like the ""Message to Love"" DVD. I got dizzy watching this claustrophobic display. Skip the video until it gets a better treatment. In the meantime buy the CD. It doesn't compromise as much."
5,Better than the best,"It's a shame that this long overdue reissue repeats the incomplete and scrambled setlist of earleir VHS and DVD versions, but that's the bad news. The good news is that this newly re-mastered DVD has significantly improved the video quality and vastly improved the audio quality, it's an enormous upgrade. If you already own the earlier version and are wondering if replacing it makes sense, absolutely, the improved sound alone is well worth it. If you don't have it yet, make sure you get the 2004 version, it is a two-hour lesson in why The Who were known as the most explosive live act in rock."
3,the who at their zenith,"DVD is just stellar for music titles, thanks to the ability to jump to individual songs (not to mention the far superior sound quality). Three new top-notch releases demonstrate that with ease. The Who Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970 ($24.98; Eagle Rock) is a thunderous pleasure. I can't speak to whether it might have been remastered even better (the filming of the concert seemed fairly haphazard) but when the band took the stage at 2 am they were in full rock star mode, each one wearing an outfit more ludicrous than the last and the band as tight as ever. It's not flashy but the immediacy is palpable and Keith Moon looks positively possessed as he flails away gleefully on the drums. Great fun and only $4 more than regular DVD on sale at Amazon. I don't have that edition to compare it to, but if you want it and haven't bought it yet, the BluRay is worth the extra few dollars. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
5,Great scissors,"These are really good scissors for the price. They have stayed sharp after several months of use. And best of all, they're pretty!"
4,Improvement from Second Album,This album is quite an improvement from their second album. It doesn't have as much filler. It has a catchy first song and there are many treats throughout such as the funky Canary in a Coalmine and childlike De Do Do.... The songs have a quick almost rushed feel. The album is plagued by some instrumentals but is quite solid if you like the anxious feeling of it
4,great album,"Great album, no doubt about it. I love the lyrics. They are clever and not meaningless.The rythms are great and each musician plays at their best.The downside would be the lack of hits besides 1 and 7, but then again I think that because this album was done between tours the material is more ""live"" stuff and has a mixed bag of different styles.Favorite tracks are 1,2,3,5,7,9 and 8. Recommended."
4,zenyatta mondatta is the sound of the rhythm...,"critics were fools to have dissed this album...they may have because it was widely played on black radio...if the only cuts on it were ""when the world..."" and ""voices inside my head"", it would STILL be worth the money..."
4,"Some filler, but solid","Check out ""aucontraire's"" reviews by clicking on his/her name. That should give you some idea of the musical taste of this misguided person, who has absolutely no business evaluating a Police album."
3,"Four great songs, but.....","With the release of Zenyatta Mondatta The Police were starting to become a household name. Don't Stand So Close To Me and the catchy De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da were hits on mainstream rock stations. On album rock radio they also played Driven To Tears frequently. The majority of the rest of the album is, unfortunately, mostly filler material. I honestly prefer Ghost In The Machine over Zenyatta Mondatta, as it has a more consistent feel.Three and a half stars for Zenyatta *** 1/2"
4,Bombing Afghanistan,"Well, this album is not bad if you are a Police fan. Strong material like ( De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da, Dont Stand So Close To Me, Driven To Tears, When The World Is Running Down, and Canary In A Coalmine ) , but the most amazing in the coincidence with the news ( Bombs away ( in afghanistan ), Driven to tears, When The World Is Running Down, and also Behind My Camel ). Now I am sure that the best come back of the police is now, maybe with Zennyatta 2001. It would be a commercial success."
1,no sound at all,"This is one of of Police records I like most. Unfortunately, there is something wrong with SACD Amazon sent. It is not recognized by my McIntosh MPV861, so I get not sound at all. I tried to send it back from my country but Amazon's shipping agent in Venezuela (UPS via Aerocav) is charging almost USD 120 to return it, so at the end it is cheaper to keep this not sounding sacd here at home."
3,Third album blues,"What a strange album! Unmistakeably the Police, but you have gilt-edged singles such as ""Dont Stand So Close To Me"" and ""De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da"", sitting next to conscience tweakers like ""Driven To Tears"", or post apocalyptic songs like ""When the World Is Running Down"" (still a Sting favourite). Sandwiched between these songs are a few of Sting's weaker moments, plus the inevitable low spots such as Stewart's ""Bombs Away"" and ""The Other Way Of Stopping"" and Andy Summers' ""Behind My Camel"" memorable only for winning a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Were the Police running out of ideas? Sting could still write great songs when he tried, and the band were superb in concert, but this was the third patchy album in a row..."
2,"I guess this is the ""re-reissue""...","Okay, so lessee... the original CD came out in the 80's some time, which sounded like junk. Then the remastered version came out in 1995, which sounded fine. So what, if I buy it a third time, will they come and play at my house? Uh 'scuse me, isn't there something better you folks could do with your time? It's no wonder Universal has to cut prices on their CDs, what with brilliant reissue projects like this."
4,more police,"I don't know which Police album is their best, but this is probably the one I listen to the most. It's also the one that had some really popular songs still played to this day, and songs that bring back the most memories of my childhood many years ago (which seem like only yesterday- I wish they were!)The songs you haven't heard from this album are probably the best ones. I think you will find that out when you hear it. In fact, ""Canary In A Coalmine"", ""Bombs Away"", and ""Behind My Camel"" are my three favorite songs. The rest of the album is just very good melodic early 80's rock and roll. A band that probably deserves all the positive attention they have received over the years."
4,HAS ALL OF DUSTY'S HITS IN THE UK,"If you want just one CD to give you all of Dusty's hits then this is it.So why not 5 stars,well,I can never understand why CD producers choose not to put tracks in chronological order,also some earlier tracks are mono and do not have very good sound quality.The reason for this is the original master tapes have been lost,so with just a couple of exceptions,any Dusty compilation will suffer the same fate.In my case I found a CD with these earlier tracks in stereo and bought it,however it only covers her earlier work,see ""Stay Awhile-I Only Want to Be with You/Dusty Stay Awhile-I Only Want to Be with You/Dusty.""I have done a review of this CD,there are 2 version of it,you want the Taragon one,not the Philips one.With these 2 CDs,you will have all of Dusty's hits plus plenty more fabulous music and ALL IN HIGH QUALITY STEREO.The Taragon CD is easier to find on the USA Amazon site,do see my other Dusty reviews.(I live in the UK,more reviews are on the .co.uk site)"
1,desole!,"okay, so this movie is unforgettable, beautiful, the world of film is changed because of its existence-- BUTto not have put it in letterbox is a CRIME! Its like going tothe Louvre and only seeing half the mona lisa. Everyscene of this film is like a painting chopped in half, the scene when shes danicing is especially painful. Why, oh WHY did they do that!!! LETTERBOX ONLY PLEASE!"
1,Don't waste your money with this one,"It really does not work with your dent.It might be useful on a big dent, but do not try on a dent that smaller that dime size.But !!! I can use the glue gun for other purpose ^^"
3,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS FOR RVers,"I have purchased both the first and second editions of this bookand have found it extremely helpful. Coupled with a travel book that gives more details on things to see and do, it is perfect for RVers. Improvements I'd suggest are:1. PLEASE review rules of punctuation before the next edition. Either break two separate (but related) thoughts into two separate sentences or use a semicolon (not a comma)in the middle.2. The basic info on cities and sites is good, but it would be nice to see more options for itineraries. What's on that other highway? Are there alternate ways to get from Point A to Point B? What are the differences in miles, road conditions, campgrounds, etc.? Are there roads to avoid?Keep up the good work!"
3,mise a jour,"C'est effectivement une aide précieuse pour certains voyageurs qui recherchent absolument le camping sécuritaire.Toutefois mme si la 2eme edition n'a encore que deux ans, elle devrait déjà tre à jour car plusieurs trailer park n'existent plus. De plus dans la version vendue au Canada il manque les pages 320 à 353...Erreur a l'assemblage sans doute...Myke et Terri pourrait aussi signaler les Pemex possédant espace et services pour arrt d'urgence(une nuit...) lorsque necessaire..."
3,Better from the UK,"This has been remastered in the UK and also has come out as a Blu Ray title in the UK as well. The jury is out on whether the USA blu ray will measure up as it hasn't been released yet (as of the writing of this review). I have this USA 40th anniversary set, but I hear the remastering is much better on the UK standard DVD set, so if you have a multi-region player I suggest you snag one as it is now out of print, or splurge on a blu ray player."
3,Could have been done better,This is a decent show but it could have been done better. Especially the final episode which in my opinion didn't do the series justice. The remastering is pretty good. I am reviewing the 40th Anniversary Edition. I really enjoy Secret Agent/Danger Man and respect Mr. McGoohan as an actor. It's still and entertaining series but in my opinion isn't all that it could have been.
5,hallmark series,"the prisoner is one of the hallmark series of television, and bloody brilliant entertainment.some reviews have made note of some audio problems, ..."
3,Much Better Than The Remake,"It's a kind of cult favorite, but the remake that started in 2009 is unbelievably boring in comparison.This series only ran for a handful of episodes, so don't expect a lot. But it is the whole thing."
1,Discs don't play on a Sony PS3,"I had such high hopes for this. There's added audio commentary and a restored original edit of Arrival.Alas, my PS3 -- which is quite likely one of the most common blu-ray players in the hands of consumers -- insists that the discs are invalid.A&E; fouled up in their first outing with the DVDs around a decade ago. I tried contacting them, but they're not owning up to anything yet. They're just telling me to return the discs to the seller."
3,"all-time great series, box set lacking...","i want to say first off that i'm a huge prisoner fan. i loved the series from beginning to end for all that it is. this review will be only of the dvd box set.ok, the audio and video quality are fantastic. but here's my gripe: 10 discs for a 17 episode series? talk about being greedy! they could have easily had 4 episodes to a disc. even if it were 3 episodes per disc leaving the final disc chock full of extras that would nearly cut this set's size in half. speaking of which the extras in this set are nothing special. theres not even an interview with patrick mcgoohan!i'm lucky i got mine at a bargain or else i never would have bothered."
5,"Amazing quality, a must buy for any fan of The Prisoner.","I bought The Prisoner on Blu-ray yesterday. Contrary to the one star reviews that were written before the Blu-ray release by people that had not seen the Blu-ray set yet, I can definitively say the picture and sound quality is top notch and is 100x better than the previous US dvd releases. (which I also own and compared it too.)There really is no comparison here. The previous dvd's were muddy and the picture quality was severely lacking. The image on the Blu-ray release is crisp, clear and looks absolutely amazing. It looks like it could have been filmed yesterday.I think if I had one complaint it would be that the fifth disc that contains many of the extras is a regular DVD and not in HD. However knowing that I would still have bought this set and been completely happy with my purchase.The Prisoner has never looked or sounded better."
3,"New package, new book, that's it","Alas, owners of the previous DVDs have no reason to upgrade: A&E; has simply improved the packaging (dumping the clamshells for slim cases), throwing in a map of The Village and a nicely done 60-page episode guide. The DVDs' numerous but mostly unexceptional extras are ported over.The original discs looked OK but it's a bloody shame this imaginative and colorful series didn't get the first-rate restoration it deserves. What's up, A&E; No. 1?"
4,Great But for Packaging and Disc 5,"As others have noted, packaging is pretty much non-existent (I liked the Village map suggestion) and Disc 5 does not play in my Samsung Blu-Ray player, although it does play on my PC. However, the video quality more than makes up for these issues."
5,"Them bones, them bones, them dry bones","Other than the packaging being very, very bland I have no complaints. I wish they could have included a map of the village, a penny-farthing badge, a generic version of the Talley-ho or really any insert aside from advertising the 'new' ""prisoner"" series. There's no book, the cover pulls out and gives a short description of each episode and disk. To me, that's pretty lame. But other than that the actual quality of the picture is amazing! I have the old DVD of Arrival and played it from my DVD player while flipping back and forth to the Blu-ray of the same episode. Night and day. I can't get over how colorful and sharp these episodes are now. If you've been waiting on buying the whole series, your wait is over. Whose side are YOU on?"
2,The prisoner,"Hi Amazon.I received a complete set of 'The Prisoner' in a very quick time from USA to New Zealand, but when I have tried to play them a display comes up saying 'wrong region'. My understanding is that all DVD were common throughout the world.I know that Australia & NZ are common so I would like non automatic response from Amazon to advise how this problem can be rectified. Murr"
3,good to ALMOST the last drop ...of acid,"When I first ran into the Prisoner series, I quickly became a fan. Great concept, suspense, action, adventure and topped off with the examination of one's identity and how important it is. This series was magnificently crafted all the way until the last episode or two, when McGoohan either decided to drop acid and cop out on the ending OR didn't HAVE an ending so he decided to go insane and figured the more sychophantic viewers out there would compensate by making their own ending and fill in the gaps of what became a silly, nonsensical, disorganized mish-mash of a finale. A shame they ended it as they did because it was a top notch sci-fi thriller until the penultimate episode. And I won't be buying it on DVD only because of the ending, unless it goes on sale used for $10 around here. I gave it three stars for the good episodes. Let's hope the new production with Eccleston fares better with it's ending."
5,"What's the deal, Amazon?",There's a release date. There's cover art. Why can't we pre-order this yet?
4,Back to the village?,"Okay Iron Maiden Fans, if you should see this, this may be for someone else (that is if you have any interest left in discovering the root themes in 15 year old heavy metal). Boys and girls if you're looking for a true mind twist, you may really like this for its own merit, unlike some wanna-be musician poseur-intellectual dirt-bags who would influence you for their own gratification to prove how ""hip"" they are in post-MOD culture (go to the coldest place HELA has to offer BADGER, you waste of quasi-anthropod excreate matter, and return nevermore from bifrost, Fremont never needed you, ya prick!). SOME hold this series to be the avatar of the ""in"" crowd of SF. Be fooled no more. Let all see the enlightenment (Guess the next stop is Dr. Who or Red Dwarf)"
4,"Prisoner, complete series.","Prisoner is ""different"", it looks a little dated now of course, but it is still a lot of fun to watch. The story is timeless and makes you think.......""what is real, could it happen??????""Patrick McGoohan is perfect in the lead role of the confused and angry ex-spy who sets about planning to escape, but where and what is he escaping from?Well done, very different type of spy series."
5,Brief - and to the point,"A real plesure to see one of my favorites (without commercials) from the 60s. Of course, some of the technical aspects are a little dated, but ""The Prisoner"" still remains among the finest series ever produced. Just sit back and enjoy it - psycho-analysis not required. As usual, Patrick McGoohan shines in his role as he always has in any TV or movie effort."
4,Very Good but the Network UK set is far superior,"I concur with those that have stated that this is NOT the restored versions released last Oct in the UK from the original 35MM tapes. So it gets a strike against it for that. However I have purchased this set and it is acceptable to the average consumer. However the UK set is markedly superior. You would need a region-free player to play the UK set, and the set is more expensive than this version, but I believe it is worth it as I have seen the difference."
5,Great!,"Great set. I won't go into the details about the actual show, but will say the picture quality is fantastic. Lots of bonus stuff, and pretty cheap too.A must buy!"
4,Offbeat,It has been a walk through memory lane to actually get DVD's of The Prisoner. I remember watching it on TV many years ago. I always liked Patrick McGoohan and it is nice to actually be able to get hold of his early DVD's like Dangerman and Prisoner. Very good value.
4,There is no escape for The Prisoner fans,"A great show, the mega-set has pristine high quality reproductions of all the episodes. Even those not aired in the US. Not to be outdone the box set includes documentaries on the show's production and influences. Part of the mystique of 'Prisoner' is that no one knows for sure what it is all about. The documentaries raise the questions, highlight the deep issues that may be being alluded to, but in the end the questions thankfully remain unanswered."
5,Absolutely the best!,"""The Prisoner"" in my opionion is the most imaginative television series ever produced. I saw it as a teenager when it was initially shown in the US as a summer replacement series and I was in awe of it! The final two episodes are perhaps the two most mindblowing and imaginative two hours ever shown on TV...even today I am very impressed with the quality of this program on almost every level. True, some of the effects are lame by todays standards but that does not detract from the greatness of this program...This series operates on several levels...on the surface, it is an exciting spy story as we try, along with Number 6, to determine just who captured him and brought him to the Village. However, it is also a great psychological thriller that grows on you with each episode until the incredible finale in episodes 16 and 17....I highly, highly recommend it!!!! It is well worth the price!"
2,Defective DVD set.,"While I like the Prisoner series, this DVD set has some kind of manufacturing defect. Most of the DVDs have some foggy blotches on them and cause the episodes to skip. To rate the series: ***** stars. The series is subject to very interesting political interpretation. McGoohan has some terrific moments as an actor with his facial expressions.Did I say I like the series? That's an understatement. I truely enjoyed it. Moments are inspirational. The sociopolitical notions are brilliantly classic in this series."
3,"Great beginning, but descends into self-indulgent nonsense","Yes, I'm probably going to out myself as someone who ""doesn't get it"", but wow, was I disappointed by this. It's obvious in the sequence of epsiodes (""Do Not Forsake Me..."") where McGoohan ran out of ideas and/or lost interest in this. The intriguing cat-and-mouse games between captive and captors were abandoned for a lot of incoherent, self-indulgent nonsense culminating in the finale. I will confess, though, to being jolted when, at the end of the finale, when the door to his house opened with the same sound effects as his Village bungalow (and the number ""1"" on the door!) Also, a technical quibble: I very often had to crank up the volume to hear the dialogue only to be blasted by the music and sound effects."
4,Prisoner BR Qualiy is Wow! Disc 5 is an issue,"The Prisoner is stunning in Blu-Ray. For years I've watched lousy VHS recordings I made from PBS about 12 years ago, and now I am in heaven watching stunning color and sound. My discs are 4:3 aspect ratio. I thought I read a review stating their discs were 16:9. Wasn't this show shot in 4:3? The big problem is Disc 5. It does not play on my Panasonic BR players nor my Panasonic standard-def combo DVD player. It does play on my Sony DVD player at work and my no-name kitchen TV that has a crummy DVD player. I would rate this as 5-stars, but 4-stars due to the stupid Disc 5. I did not buy my set from Amazon. I did send A&E Home Video an email stating the problem, but I received an automatic email replay that said something like ""If your email doesn't concern a delivery or purchase problem, don't expect a reply."" I should rate this video set at 1-star after this reply, but I like the series too much."
4,"The REAL ""Prisoner""","After seeing the lame excuse for ""The Prisoner"" on AMC, I was eager to see the blu-ray edition of the groundbreaking original. Though the picture quality was good I was disappointed in thre sound quality of the first installment, ""Arrival"". The music was far too loud and the voice audio was far too weak. This should have been addressed before the final product was mastered. The extras were quite interesting for any Prisoner fan. I can't believe the series is over 40 years old.....it still holds up today (technology excluded)."
5,The Prisoner,Possibly one of the best TV shows of all time. Requires thought from the viewer and a certain open mindedness. It helps to have or be familiar Secret Agent Man.
3,I wanted to like it...,"more than I did. While The Prisoner is certainly an important show in television history,it's a bit silly and dated more often than not. There are great moments, and visually it'sa trip. But by the end of the series, I was worn out with the random strangeness of it all...I'm a huge fan of good television, and glad I gave The Prisoner a shot. But to me, it fallsshort of the all-time greats: The Twilight Zone, Twin Peaks and The X-Files."
1,FIFTH DISC OF BONUS ITEMS DOES NOT PLAY,"SADLY, VERY SADLY, the 5th disc of EXTRAS DOES NOT and I repeat DOES NOT play in a PANSONIC BLURAY PLAYER. I returned 3 sets of these and the ALL HAVE THE SAME MANUFACTURING DEFECT. SO BUYER BEWARE.Picture over all is GOOD but not AMAZING as some have said (and I have a top of the line-- not sold in box stores--Panasonic 1080p Plasma; 50 inch--Voted DIRECT TV picture of the year). However, sound is MUCH IMPROVED though over the 2001 DVD release (which I also have). But HiDef? HA! I think not. Very far from it."
3,I agree that McGoohan has trouble being around ladies,"The Honest One poster on here mentioned that Prisoner Companion book. I've gotten my hands on an old copy since reading that review. It does indeed say McGoohan had problems with intimacy on the set of The Prisoner series. Therefore, I too feel his obviously uncomfortable attitude with women on the show is not an act (which I chalked it up to being originally) but an indication of a man undergoing problems woith homosexuality or at least bi-=sexuality."
5,Excellent juxtaposition of recent Austen film & originals,"I'm a big fan of Jane Austen in all forms. I've always thought that a mediocre Austen film is better than none at all. This book takes a fascinating scholarly look at Austen's film treatment. The authors say everything all true Austen fans have muttered about the films (""where's THAT in the book?!"") and explains why it was done in such a way (for example, modern filmgoers won't appreciate an ugly, boring Edward Ferrers). Contains amusing critique of Thompsons S&S--that Austen's originial may have been more ""feminist"" than Thompson! If you enjoy the original written Austen and/or the recent film versions, you'll love this book."
5,Outstanding Product,"Bengal Flea Killer Plus is a simply amazing product. It does everything it claims to do. If you spray the house in the afternoon all the fleas are dead by that night. One spraying lasts all season, for me alot longer. If you have a problem with fleas this is your solution."
5,A delightful biography and travelogue.,"""My Father's Island"" is absolutely delightful. The book includes a very amusing view of cultural differences as seen by young Johanna; first between America and Quito, Ecuador and then between civilized Quito and the rugged pioneer lifestyle required just a few decades ago in the Galapagos.The flora and fauna of the islands are more accurately named and described here than in the book ""Floreanna."" I recommend ""My Father's Island"" over ""Floreanna"" for providing more information on the islands, the lifestyle and for a more compelling story.I now feel that I have a better idea of the hardships and challenges faced by the early settlers to the Galapagos. And, to top it off real life love stories are included, too!I am looking forward to Johanna Angermeyer's next book."
5,My Father's Island,This is a must read if you are planning a trip to the Galapagos. The history of the islands is in this book as well as true information about the folks who settled there.
2,"Presentations are meaningless, off topic, insensitive, and crude","I was very disappointed in this book. I agree that the authors are very off topic. To be fair, I only read about 6 of the entries as I was so disgusted and bored at that point, it was meaningless to wade thru any more.Some of the stories were simply off-topic or at the very most only mentioned in passing, the subject.Some of the writings were crude to the point that I wondered how the family members of those who had died would feel. This was the offering of a writer from the city where this aweful event occured? Unbelieveable. Where does your mind have to be to even think out loud this way?If you are interested in rambling stories that have no point and no message, this is the book for you.Otherwise, there have been many others written that would encourage and educate you more."
1,poor taste,I looked forward to this book! It arrived and the first story I read is about a woman wandering the street and about the sexual encounter she had had with someone in the Towers. Seemed to me the experience was more important than the person. The story contained many F words and I find it distasteful. The whole world doesn't revolve around this. I surely wouldn't buy it for anyone. That story spoiled the rest of the book for me.
4,Well worth owning,"Great CD that has seemed to get lost in the shuffle of his career. If You Choose to Go and Every Beat of My Heart are classic Chris. This isn't his best effort, but if you have heard Auberge and Road to Hell, it is well worth the investment."
3,just o.k,"if you like rose royce(and i do)its ok to buy,not a lot of lights,no big pretty stages,the crowd does not seem to get into the concert until carwash,im not sure if thats the original lead singer from the 70's.wish they had done im goin down.like i said its just ok."
2,Not worth it,"This has delicious sounding recipes - however, EVERY ONE of them requires pre-cooking something before you can ever put in the cooker. My idea of a slow cooker recipe is one in which I can just dump stuff in and go. No, not with this book. What a complete waste of money, I don't have time to do all that's required to make these recipes!"
2,Cheesy-eggy-whipped cream filled recipes...not many healthy choices,"The slow-cooking book I really love is Robin Robertson's Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker, which has amazing plant-based chilis, soups, jambalayas, etc. 125 best Vegetarian Slow Cooker recipes is less imaginative in its seasonings; most of the recipes rely heavily on cheese, eggs, whipped cream etc. (examples -- of the 16 appetizer recipes, only 2 are plant-based, including spiced nuts; of the 21 desserts, only 1 -- pears poached in wine). The ""vegan-friendly"" recipes I've tried have been fine, but nothing I felt drawn to return to.So for those who are looking for great food that's healthier, lower in fat, more sustainable, this may not be your cookbook. Check out Robin Robertson or Kathy Hester's The Vegan Slow Cooker: Simply Set It and Go with 150 Recipes for Intensely Flavorful, Fuss-Free Fare Everyone (Vegan or Not!) Will Devour."
2,Not So Slow Cooker afterall,"When I read the review of this cookbook, it seemed perfect. When I read through the recipes after it arrived, it appears that the recipes require additional cooking outside of the slow cooker. Just about all of them require sauteeing, boiling down first, some sort of cooking before you actually slow cook. That is not slow cooking to me. I need to put the ingredients in the pot and come home to the recipe made."
5,Fantastic Recipes!,"I have a shelf full of cookbooks and several slow cooker specific books. I usually consider a cookbook worth the money if it gives me one really great recipe that becomes a regular staple of my cooking repertoire. I consider a cookbook a success if there are two or three that are particularly great. This cookbook has exceeded any expectation I have. Every recipe I have made has been phenomenal, packed with flavor, very easy to make, and worthy of making again and again. The tortilla soup is restaurant-worthy!I'm not a vegetarian, but one of my best friends is. When we cook together, we go veggie. She owns this book and loves it, and I'm ordering a copy to have at my house, because some of these recipes are so good, even a committed meat-eater will love. If all vegetarian food tasted like these recipes, I wouldn't miss meat."
1,125 Best Vegetarian Slow cooker Recipes,Recipe for Mushroom Cholent on p 133 was a horrible experience. I have never worked so hard to end up throwing out groceries. The measurements for ingredients are ridiculous however the flavor so bad different quantities would not have made a difference.
1,"1 Star, since I won't be using this book","I obviously purchased this book for recipes to make in my slow cooker. Since just about every recipe requires pre-cooking, I simply won't be using it; it's just more trouble than I'm willing to go through. It's not just browning onions in the slow cooker, but cooking eggplant, peppers, etc. If I were going to go through all that, I don't need to add another step of using the slow cooker. This was just not what I was hoping, or looking, for."
4,This book is FANTASTIC,"I was hesitant to purchase this book because I'm Vegan and I spend a lot of my time revamping vegetarian cookbooks to fit that lifestyle, having to omit and replace, but this book was fantastic! There are many, many items in the book that are vegan ""friendly"" and I have to say, they are totally delicious. Last night I made the Sweet Potato and Barley Risotto - outstanding. Needed just a little dab of soy milk (or soy butter) for a creamier texture, but it was fantastic and didn't require any salt for flavor whatsoever.The only shock for me was the amount the recipe made. The recipe suggests it serves 4. Even as a main dish, if that was a serving, I would be big as a house. It could easily serve 8-10 with 1 cup servings. 1 1/2 cups barley really expands when cooked!I am thrilled I bought this and would recommend it to vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters trying to find variety alike!"
4,Delicious food; a couple of minor gripes,"So far, the recipes I've tried from this book have been delicious and fairly easy to prepare. (I avoid anything that looks very time-consuming or that requires exotic ingredients.) I'd definitely buy this book again.However, I wish it had these two kinds of data for each recipe: portion size and portion-size nutrition. Perhaps a subsequent edition can include those data."
5,High Yield Cartridge,"I ordered this cartridge back in December of 2010 and it has worked like a charm. It has lasted us 1 year and 9 months. We use this printer for personal use perhaps that is why it has lasted this long before we needed a new cartridge. Yes, it's expensive BUT the price on Amazon is the BEST. Nevertheless, we print very freely and have been very happy with the printer. I am technology challenged but even I had no problems with installation. HP is awesome."
3,Good product but does not last forever,"I bought this set in 2005 for my kitchen and we have used everyday since then. The set has been great and looks very contemporary. The glass top is perfect as I have two young children who usually spill all sorts of food and drinks. The chairs also can be cleaned easily. After five years of abuse, one of the chairs finally gave in because my husband loves to rock his chair while he eats. This should not have happened if he did not have such a bad habit. I am really sad because as the chairs have metal legs, it needs to be welded somehow if I am to save the chair. Overall, it is worth the money and if it wasn't for my husband, I would not have to replace the chair in another five more years."
4,What if we could exceed the speed of light with INFORMATION,"This easy to read little book takes a peek at what interstellar travel would be like if man could find a way to overcome the limitations of the speed of light*. The human space traveler in the book (I suspect it's Dr. Bunea) suggests such a way, and proceeds to use it to hop from one planet to another in the company of a more-than-friendly extra- terrestrial guide. This navigator-to-the-stars explains the many alternative life forms and hyper-civilized behaviors of advanced human- like creatures, found in the neighborhood of our solar system. These creatures possess telepathic powers, thereby obviating the need for voice communication, and this comes in handy. I recommend adding this thought-provoking paperback to ones sci-fi bookshelf. [* the reader is referred to serious research in the area of quantum teleportation, ML]Mr. Melvin Lewis, Director Oakland Institute for Gravitational Wave Research"
3,Still pithy (now and then) after all these years,"Sontag isn't relevant to anything anymore, but her voice is still engaging every once in a while. This collection is mostly odds and ends, occasional pieces, dribs and drabs. Actually, it's more a clipbook than a collection. Sontag remains a curiosity, even if her brainlight has dimmed. And even the worst of her nonfiction is better than her fiction."
5,Brilliant.,"This is the kind of musical pleasance that represents the best of what true pop can be. Simple and catchy without ever coming close to stupid--lyrically and musically solid. This thing stayed in my Walkman for about a year straight when it came out. It's little use getting into which songs stand out, as there isn't a weak one in the bunch, but the closer, ""Angel,"" leaves absolutely nothing to be desired. Dig in. Whatever you know about this band, they've never been better than this."
2,Something to keep in mind while reading -- check his facts,"This could have been a definitive book, a book of fencing for our times -- but it is riddled with numerous factual/historical inaccuracies. Just two examples a few pages apart: Cohen writes (on page 151) that the film ""Duel at Ichijoji (1964)"" was the ""first of that trilogy"" -- when the title is actually ""Duel at Ichijoji Temple"" and it is the second of the trilogy and the year should be 1956. A major blunder though is Yukio Mishima being called a ""Nobel-laureate"" (p. 155). Strange that none of the professional reviewers picked up on that one or warns readers about similar errors. It's been an annoying read, having to second-guess and stop to double check Cohen's facts."
2,"Nice attempt, but quite bad overall","I'm a non-European fencer, having studied Japanese Swordfighting instead. I picked this book up because it purported to have information on Japanese fighting, and I was interested in reading about it.So that was thrown out the window pretty quick, as this book is a definite European Fencing book. It has 2 chapters on japanese work, and it is very high level and not useful.But I read the book anyway, attempting to learn about European fencing. Overall, the author tries hard, but the book is unorganized and tries to use a shotgun, when a rifle would have been suited. It seems like the author was attempting to put a feather in his already immpressive career."
1,"Dreary, Sloppy","As a fencer and as a reader of serious non-fiction I must say this clunky, dense and aimless book is a disappointment.Cohen's history is as deep as cocktail party anecdote and his writing is often patronizing and windy. A must-miss."
4,Historically accurate but broad enough to cover Hollywood,"I found this book useful for my research into the social context of fenching, for a book I was researching. It is well written and entertaining. Also enjoyed the breadth of coverage which includes chapters on ""show"" fencing such as Hollywood swash-bucklers."
1,Bad book. Period,"One more time, an anglo saxon writer took the chance to write a book where everything is justified thorugh anglo saxon eyes.History is just a flow of events where only english (americans) or french had a role.The book is pretty much full of historical mistakes, over than exposing everything always with the purpose to highlight the english, american (sic!) or french culture, maliciously dening or just ignoring other cultures (greater cultures) achievements."
3,"A good effort, but ...","... unfortunately, the author has not taken advantage of the latest research on historical fencing. These facts are easily available and a serious writer, even if not purporting to an in-depth historical analysis, should at least check his sources against current scholarship."
2,Informative but dull,"This book is very thorough--it covers every perspective and is fairly objective. However, it is very difficult to sit and read through. My attention was very easily diverted and after I finished, I couldn't remember it well enough to write my essays."
5,Highly recommended,"This is one of the best cd's to come out in recent years among all southern gospel groups. The title song, ""Bold and Unashamed"" is particularly powerful! This cd is so good that every track can be heard on crosscurrents southern on live365.com."
4,good toy but................,"this toy is cool ,but i really think it should come with a saddle and rider so they can run around the barrels, but overall, it is a good toy."
2,COUMADIN COOKBOOK REVIEW,"AS A COOKBOOK IT WAS SATISFACTORY. THE FOODS WITH THE LOWEST VITAMIN K WERE LISTED ,HOWEVER THE REAL NEED WAS A LIST OF FOODS WITH THE HIGHEST VITAMIN K.THERE IS SO MUCH CONFLICTING INFORMATION OUT HERE IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DINE OUT OR SELECT NON THREATENING MEALS."
1,disappointed...,"The original price of this product was marked as $105.00 so I thought given the original price and the brand the quality would be good. They were marked down 70-75% so I paid about $30-35 for these sunglasses. They are not worth it. They don't have polarized lenses, they are not very comfortable, and they are a bit crooked."
3,An interesting story bogged down in trivia,"The story of the famous Iron Brigade has been told many times before, rarely, however, with this kind of obsessive detail. Alan Gaff's highly subjective style of writing focuses on minutiae, often at the expense of topics larger than what the soldiers ate for breakfast. Much is made of the trivia found in quatermasters records and battle descriptions are abridged versions of those to be found in ""Battles and Leaders of the Civil War."" Overall, the book is marked by a tedious accretion of detail with overwrought writing and dubious attribution of sentiments. Not the worst book on the Iron Brigade surely, but not the best read either."
4,Does the job for a small room,"I bought this heater for my daughter's room. It works great and I don't have to worry about her being cold at night when she kicks off her blankets. The temperature control keeps the room from getting too hot and it's ceramic, so you can touch it and not get burned. But when I tried using it in our living room (which is quite large), it didn't seem to make a difference. So, this little heater is great for small rooms, especially for the price!"
2,"Not a good product, but might be a fluke","I wasn't pleased with this heater fan. It arrived in the mail fine, I used it for about 8 hours at work on the low setting. It threw plenty of heat and I was thrilled with it. I turned it off at the end of the day. The next morning, it would not turn back on. All day long I kept trying to get it to work again, testing different plugs and whatnot. I ended up returning it for a refund that week.It was a good product when it was on and maybe I just had a defective one as the other reviews of this product are good."
3,Honeywell HZ-2302 Power Oscillator Electric Heater,"It is a good heater and does it's job, BUT it has a childproof on off and control switch that is also senior citizen proof. I just have to pull the cord to turn it off and on. If the switch was easily usable I would give it 5 stars."
4,not bad for the price,"Surprisingly good for how small it is. It's a pain to turn on - the dial is weird - but other than that, it's worth it for the price."
1,Useless,"Recently bought this heater and straight out of the box it did not work. The heater turned itself off after about 15 seconds. The fan never worked. It did not oscillate and the unit itself looked like it might have been opened. I went to return the item following the instructions from ANTonline (where it came from), but to do that, I had to pay for my own shipping AND include a check for $10 for them to return it back to me after they had tried to repair it. These costs (as well as the original shipping charge) add up to more than the actual unit cost.It got thrown in the garbage instead.Very diasapointed, because my past experience with returning things bought from amazon have been very positive."
2,NOT a heater,"I bought this for my work because it is so cold in office. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. It blows cool/ warm air. No matter how much I turn the knobs to warm, the temp does not change. I think it makes me colder, actually.No HEAT from this ""Heater"". Again, I would NOT recommend."
2,Just rooting for the film to end,"For a few minutes at a time, it works, and those minutes are a pleasure - but those minutes are gradually buried by the mass of the film which doesn't work and the audience is finally just rooting for the film to end."
5,Favorite book,"Have this book from when my son was little, between him and the grandkids there is little left of it. This new copy will hopefully last through the grandkids. All of them have the same favorite line......and it set the house down with a SOFT WHUMP, laughter follows everytime. Love it."
4,Excellent aid for learning Spanish,"I am an intermediate student of Spanish, and my biggest problem is understanding native speakers who are talking at their normal (rapid) rate.This audiotape has been a tremendous help in improving my ability to understand speech ""on the fly"". The reader has excellent enunciation, reads in a dramatic and entertaining fashion, and the Spanish seems grammatically correct, without a lot of confusing idioms or colloquialisms.And since the story is so familiar, if I lose the thread at any point, I soon am back on track.My only criticism is that the story is abridged at certain points, which can throw off the listener who is familiar with the story.I have sent this tape to others trying to learn to be fluent in Spanish, and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,1/2 inch Impact Hammer Drill,"I bought one of these from EDM Wholesalers on ebay... same product. i can't begin to describe how cheap it is. i had hoped that it would at least work, but didn't expect it to last long. Well, it only lasted about 2 minutes. The plastic case holds the rotor in place, so as soon as you put any pressure on it to start drilling the rotor melts the case and the thing falls apart.I wouldn't take another one of these if you paid me to do it (I think I now have lung cancer from the smoke of the melting case)"
1,junk,do not buy this drill it is junk not worth your time this is the worst item I have ever bought from amazon they should stop selling it.
1,Totally Useless,"This hammer drill is a joke. Concrete drilling will cause it to stall and the smoke of a burning motor fills the air. And it doesn't ""hammer"". If you ordered this thing ... save yourself time and either toss it in the trash or return it. I tossed it in the trash ... not worth the time to return ... and I wanted to forget about it as soon as possible. This is the first bad ""Made in China"" item that I've purchased and is truly first-class junk. It's proof ""you get what you pay for""."
2,It's an addict's story folks,"For those who are complaing that this book is not a comprehensive history of The Ramones, you are missing the point. This is the story of one Dee Dee Ramone, a man who lived part of his life as bassist for the band, and lived his whole life as a drug addict. Ego? Of course. As addicts, we are insecure egomaniacs and if we don't have our sobriety, we have no chance of building a better life from this chaos.Dee Dee never found what he needed. The only irony is that the word ""Surviving"" is in the title. Like thousands before and after him who are still suffering, Dee Dee did not survive."
1,Hollow Victory Speech,"I opened this book knowing that Dee Dee Ramone had died of a heroin overdose. So, when he teed-off with all of this ""I've finally found peace with myself"" and ""one day at a time"" banter, I couldn't help but question the memoir's sincerity right out of the gate.The book simply exposes Dee Dee Ramone for what he was--a gluttonous fool who tripped into a pile of fame and blew it.The guy was simply stupid and clueless and the narrative reinforces this at every turn. The relentless war stories are nothing more than a pathetic attempt to convince readers that he was truly hard-core, the real McCoy. It's just run-of-the-mill re-habber self-promotion that grows incredibly stale incredibly quickly.If you want to read about punk (or the Ramones, for that matter,) read ""Please Kill Me."" Forget this book. Unless you're truly a die-hard Ramones fan (or a die-hard ""higher power"" type,) you will despise it."
4,sincere and confessional,"This book was surprisingly good. Dee Dee's sincerity and honesty really showed through this confessional autobiography. The book is filled with Dee Dee's insight about his journey from a highly dysfunctional family to being a successful song writer and punk star. It made me realize how much he contributed to the band and even during the times he was out of the band he was still writing songs for the Ramones on a freelance basis. What impresses me about Dee Dee is that his main goal was happiness and he was well aware of his struggle, his own ghosts and faults. This book also is simply enjoyable to read. Dee Dee is a great writer with tight chapters that wrap up nicely. I really love this book and will definitely reread it a couple more times."
2,Lobotomy: Surviving the Ramones,"Boy, did this book suck. Bad writing, bad editing. Even the preface is bad. But I guess the beefcake photos of Dee Dee on the cover make up for it."
1,beware,"i'm a huge ramones fan, and i buy all the music autobiographies i can find...that being said, this is maybe the worst book i've ever read. no insight on the ramones creative process, and pretty much no redeeming factors period. i can't believe it's even in print. seriously."
2,Guess he didn't survive after all,"This book bored me with incessant whining. But now that he's dead, I think I'll go back and read it again."
5,Past is Prologue,"I think that before anyone moves to Florida, or does business in Florida, they ought to read this book. If you've spent any time there this book will be very funny. The Art Basel enthusiasm which has made Miami hot in recent years has a distant echo in Mizner's clients for whom he created charming amalgams of various Spanish styles.At least they got a big house out of it, whereas what those who purchased at Art Basel acquired is open to some question.This book clearly shows that a certain kind of classy hucksterism is endemic to the Florida experience of art, or architecture. But it does it by telling a very amusing and in the end, sad story. Appropriately enough Boca now has Mizner Park, which is naturally is not a park at all, but a shopping mall. The Boca Museum is in there too, and the many works-on-paper contained therein, as well as drinking-fountains with their own dedicatory plaques from benefactors, show that Mizner's spirit of genial elitism continues."
1,Eyelash curler,"The photo is too far to appreciate and when I received it, it was nothing what I expected. The so called gentle rubber is very hard and it tears out my eyelashes. Maybelline use to put out a very soft kind of foam rubber on the eyelash curler and I haven't seen it in years. I am still using my very, very old one. I clean it and reuse it. It is falling apart, but it does a better job. Those new ones are horrible.I am glad I had a chance to send this review.Thank you,"
3,First time available,"This paperbound pamphlet (vi + 86 pp.) is the 1977 version of the briefing guide revised annually and sent in advance to American professors and students who had won grants to work an academic year in one of the exchange programs administered by the U.S. Educational Foundation in Pakistan, of which I was then the director. Not intended for public distribution, copies nevertheless were obtained by a U.S. Library of Congress project and put on deposit at a number of American universities having an interest in South Asia affairs. This is the first time it has become available for purchase. Perhaps the subtitle is misleading. The booklet is not ABOUT American scholars; it was intended FOR American scholars--to alert them to the challenges and satisfactions of their professional life in Pakistan."
5,Irresistibly cheerful music from South Africa,"Bouncy South African pennywhistle, or kwela, music from the leader of the Solven Whistlers, and during the 1950s a frequent collaborator with Miriam Makeba and the Skylarks. Mashiyane pretty much made the pennywhistle a popular sound, and few people could match him for the expressiveness he brought to such a seemingly limited instrument. For an all-instrumental album highlighting a fairly oddball sound, this disc is far more captivating than one might imagine. Recommended!"
1,Not helpful,"Picture quality & camera work both poor. In addition information is presented in a haphazard manner with a lot of wasted time and general chatter. Title is misleading as the DVD is mostly about fishing for sailfish, and a lot of footage is guys out fishing & not demonstrating specific technical skills."
5,Weigh in,"With no similar scale to compare this to, (other than my 25 year old one) I must say that it's simply perfect! Good looking on the floor, easy to read while standing on it, fast to register weight, extraordinarily accurate, and a breeze to keep clean. Definitely would recommend it to others."
2,I question the accuracy,"My scale values consistency over accuracy. It does not recognize small (few pound) changes in weight in repeated measurements. It reads the same until ""reset"" by a significantly different measurement. I purchased this product several weeks ago and weigh myself every morning. I became suspicious when my weight was identical every day for a week (weight is displayed to 0.2 pounds.) So I weighed myself then picked up a 12 oz tooth paste tube and reweighed, identical total weight. I added my electric tooth brush, again no change. These two items should have added just under 2 pounds. When I grabbed something weighing about 5 pounds I got a new weight. I now cycle the scale with something light, wait for it to reset, weigh myself, then wonder what I really weigh."
3,Nice while it lasted,"We bought this scale about two years ago (according to my Amazon history), and loved it. It was attractive and seemed accurate (weighing four people on a regular basis). However, it abruptly stopped working. I assumed it needed new batteries, but replacing them did nothing; the display is still blank.The three stars I gave it are an average of five stars (for when it worked), and one star (it really should have lasted more than twenty-three months)."
1,WORST SCALES EVER.,"I've boughten two taylor scales. they NEVER give the same weight. i can get off, and stand back on and there will be a 3 pound difference. I have the two scales in my bathroom. i'll get off one, and on the other, and the weigth is different by as much as 5 pounds.how is that even remotely reliable.DO NOT buy taylor scales"
1,"Not Accurate, Disapointed.","Very disappointed in the Taylor scale erratic, & very inaccurate. I tried the scale on a hard, even surface like the instructions says but it reads that I was over 40 pounds under my actual weight. My brother and mother had the same problem it was 10-25 under their actual weight."
2,Great for a light weight...,"This product looks nice and weighs great if you're under 350lbs. However, I purchased it because I weigh around 400 and it said it would go up to 440. When I got it home and started using it, it would take 10 tries just to get one valid reading. Let me tell you, this is very discouraging if you're trying to lose weight and your scale keeps giving you errors instead of lbs. It never did an overload msg, just an error msg. So I had to return it."
1,too big and heavy; did not weight accurately,"Besides the size and weight, a disadvantage if you don't want to keep it out all the time, it began with a 7 lb on the scale when I set it on the floor. Thinking this was due to uneven floor, moved it around, yet any time I used it began with this same 7 lb registered on the digital readout and then added that 7 lbs to the total weight when I stepped on it. I put my 8 lb dumbell on the scale and it weight 6.9 instead of 8 lbs. What a piece of junk right out of the box! I have an older Taylor scale that works fine, but best to let this one go to countries where people don't mind an extra 7 lbs added to their total weight."
5,Good Product!,Seems to be accurate. Looks good in my bathroom.I remember Taylor scales from when I was a child...I'm in mid 50's now!
2,Fine unless you have to put it away every day,"My experience with the scale is that it has been wildly inaccurate, but after reading the other reviews it seems people are happy unless you have my situation, which is that your bathroom is too small to leave the scale out in one place. Every time I pull it out of the cupboard I have to re-set it, which is an annoying process of stepping on and off the scale three times with intervals of waiting. I always place it around the same flat spot but I have found that if I shift it over just a few inches I can weigh seven pounds more or less. Now that is just not accurate enough for me."
2,Not so accurate,"It's a weighty scale with a nice, modern look. I like the LCD blue backlit display because it makes it easier to see the number. However, form factor aside, this is not an accurate scale.As others have mentioned, the scale # will not budge much. It's natural for your weight to fluctuate, but this scale will NOT show that. If I'm buying something that measures 1/10th of a kg, I want it to reflect that! I returned this item because it did not deliver on its intended purpose."
5,Reliable scale for reference,"Functional, reliable and stylish! Easy to read in the morning and low profile to slide under shelves. Good value for the price."
5,Great Scale!,"Happen to be shopping at Costco when I saw this scale. There was a coupon for $10 off so I thought I'd check it out. Looked alright. What got me to buy it was a man in the store saying how the reviews for hit were great. Without knowing much about the brand or it's features I bought it. Why not for around $15?! I have to say it does look really nice. It feels very solid when I step on it. The LCD blue display is nice, clear and easy to see. I especially like the fact that it takes two AAA batteries (included) instead of those expensive lithium batteries. That was a plus! Can't complain. It's a great scale for an excellent price!"
5,Taylor 7529 thick glass scale,Item being reviewedTaylor 7519 Thick Glass Scale with LCD Blue Backlit DisplayWe love this bathroom scale because the back-lit digital readout is easy to read in light or the dark. It is plenty wide for my husband's size 12 feet. It is a good product with a reasonable price.
3,Your weight doesn't change with this scale,"There is no way a product can get a 5 star rating when it has a consistent problem. Basically if your weight doesn't change enough, the scale repeats the last reading. My experience is nearly identical to other reviewers who noticed the scale's memory problem."
5,Great weightloss tool.,I love this scale. I have been trying to lose about 10 lbs for about 3 years now and this scale has been a great tool for me. I'm now down 7. I enjoy that it is precise......Also looks very nice in the bathroom.
2,Old one was okay but the newer ones aren't,"I had one of these 2 years ago that worked GREAT! After 2 years it finally gave out. :( They made some changes to the new one but I figured since I loved the old ones, I would love this one, too. Wrong! This one has been optimized to be much faster which I love but the numbers don't seem to be consistent. I weigh once a week and one time I stepped on the scale it said I had lost 6lbs! Wow! Great I thought! While still standing there though the number started to change... I stepped off, move the scale a bit to make sure it was flat on our tiles, and then stepped back on, the scale showed I gained 10lbs in the half a second! I tried a few more times and never got the same number or even CLOSE more then once. It's just not a good scale anymore I fear. :("
3,durable but not convinced how accurate it is,"We've had this for well over a year now, and it has remained very durable. In fact it's still on the original set of batteries. I'd say it's accurate within a couple of pounds but honestly it seems to fluctuate even within a given day. I mean, I don't lose two pounds from the morning to the evening..."
3,Accuracy is Questionable,"As others have stated, this scale tends to give variable readings. Quite a shame, for the balance of the scale is what I am looking for. The instant on feature is nice, the numbers easy to read, and quite attractive."
2,Didn't work well for me,"I bought this scale based on the price and the reviews. It was low enough for me to want to purchase it, and the reviews seemed favorable overall. After having received the scale, however, it hasn't been super accurate all the time. Most of the time its in range +/- 8lbs. Plus or minus 8 pounds isn't good enough for someone on a weight loss journey. I need to know how much I weigh down to the pound. I'd give the scale I have a 5/10."
1,Wildly inconsistent,"This scale is unusable and I am returning it to Amazon. I have had it for two weeks now and every morning I have tried weighing myself multiple times within 2-3 minutes and I get results which vary among themselves by as much as 3-5 pounds. This is a relatively high percentage of error given my body weight (2-3%) and makes the scale absolutely useless for monitoring weight. I have the scale on a hard tile floor as instructed. As with any scale, absolute precision is less important than relative precision, and this certainly lacks the latter. Buy something else."
1,Feel Good Scale!,"I love this scale, It automatically trims 4-5 pounds off you!I compared it with many other scales and it seem to be consistently about 2.3% lower than actual weight!If you are trying to buy a valentine's day gift, Here you go!Well at least it is consistent and you can follow trends accurately as long as you add the 2.3%"
1,VERY DANGEROUS! GLASS EXPLODED!,"We had this scale for about 8 months, during which it operated pretty good. But one night, the glass completely exploded and shattered spraying glass all over the bathroom. At the time it exploded nobody was even touching the scale. My wife was in the bathroom and thankfully she wasn't injured."
5,Drs. M. & M. are A-Okay!,"The last Book of Mormon commentary war written in the late 1950's Elders George Reynolds and Janne Sjodahl, so it was about time that another Book of Mormon commentary was written, especially since President Ezra Taft Benson placed such a pointed emphasis on this Book of Books.This commentary is also an improvement upon other books, since its focus is primarily upon doctrine, and not on archaeology or culture. I think someone once referred this at to ""likening the scriptures unto ourselves.""The books contain both the text of the Book of Mormon, followed by the specific commentary. It is, therefore, similar to Elder Bruce R. McConkie's ""Doctrinal New Testament Commentary.""This book has a good spirit about it, and I feel myself smarter and more spiritual as I have read it. I have read a lot of books, and each book has a degree of light, and this book is rather bright.It is great for Sunday School teachers and quorum instructors, or just for personal edification."
1,OK as Far as It Goes,"The package indicates one hour and nineteen minutes of playtime. However, after 20 minutes, it stops and the only option is to return to the beginning. Amazon replaced it for free but the second video yielded the same result. If you're willing to pay $15 for a 20 minute travel commercial, this one's for you. Amazon accepted a return so everything is right but the disappointment, hassle, and time lost."
1,"Oct. 27, 1998 Review Got It Right!","The ability to get music CDs on the web has rekindled my love for music and prompted me to go after some of my old favorites. The music from ""A Man and A Woman"" was wonderful in the original but horrific in this album. This was definitely not music from the original soundtrack. The first reviewer was right on target, this is a collection of ""masterpieces turned elevator music."""
2,Masterpieces turned-elevator music.,"Francis Lai's best movie themes were recorded here in renditions not vaguely reminiscent of the original sound of the films. A Swedish-produced CD centered around the Bilitis movie, with a naked woman's backside on the cover, also featuring massacred versions of some of the artist's other compositions for the silver screen. Warning: the CD cover clearly states: ""Original Soundtracks"" which the tracks on this CD are certainly not. A dissapointment."
1,Misleading,I was looking for originals of the classics especially a man and a woman and I got warmed over elevator music- buy at your own risk!
3,SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES,"FIREFIGHT is an above average, if somewhat implausible, thriller set in a smoldering forest fire. Our hero, played with astute machoism by rugged Steve Bacic, plots an armored truck robbery with Nick Mancuso, Sonya Solaama and Brad Rivoh, and to do so stages a fake fire to cover their deed. Of course, enter laconic Stephen Baldwin as Sonya's bad boyfriend and he wants all the money himself. The movie offers little novelty in its exeuction and the CGI effects are so obviously fake it brings the movie down a notch (see: Backdraft/Ladder 49 for real special effects). But it's harmless entertainment and Bacic has a strong screen presence, although the ending is a real pain in the neck!!"
3,ONLY because Mancuso is in it! ...,"ONLY because Mancuso was in it, and was SO FUNNY and CUTE! The rest You can OMIT from the Film! The Story line had better potential if Mancuso had been the lead, and they had removed the trashy crap .. It had potential for Intelligence, but ONLY with Mancuso taking the Lead ..."
3,Deeper knowledge but lacking,"The book is pretty good in that it helps you to think a little deeper in actually reading the bible. It does, however, refer to many other books, and would best be read if you had all the books it refers to, as well as a bible and time to actually read all that is said. But it's good in referring you to a deeper thought proccess of how everyone takes different readings of the bible."
4,Excellent on technique,"This book is excellent for describing technique. It's easy to follow and do. There are lots of interesting patterns and techniques you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere.There is nothing traditional about what is described here. These are techniques for modern dodads and keychains. Still, it's great fun."
2,Craven almost grows into the medium,"I happen to be a pretty big fan of Wes Craven films-- I think he makes horror into something funny and smart-- no mean accomplishment. I suppose it's only natural that I'd be disappointed by his first attempt at a novel, given that my expectations were pretty high._Fountain Society_ is based on the idea of amoral scientists deciding to extend life through cloning experiments and a love affair trying to survive through all the associated horror. The book begins *very* slowly and is full of clunky cliches and most of the major plot points are easy to guess. It did start to redeem itself by the end-- Craven started to get more of a feel for his characters and express more of the complexity that makes him such a good filmmaker. Unfortunately, it wasn't soon enough to save the novel as a reading experience.I *will* read a next novel, should there be a next novel, but I'd definitely take a miss on this one."
3,Good but something missing,"The story was good, but I felt that it skipped around a lot and it seem's that their was something missing. Maybe I'm just used to more intense story writing, like Dean Koontz, and John Saul. I feel this book would be better as a movie. Wes Craven is good at that. Fountain Society is worth reading. I guess for a first novel it's not that bad."
2,Craven should stick to horror movies,"I was extremely dissapointed with ""Fountain Society."" In the mood for a good horror book, I picked up Craven's thinking it would scare the pants off me. Instead I found myself falling asleep to the boring plot and slow, tedious writing. I finished it because I hate to stop reading books. It got a little better towards the end, but it seemed to go on and on and on. I wish he would have stuck to his genre of good, bloody horror."
4,Surprisingly Good.,"I'm a huge fan of Wes Craven's movies, so was excited to see he had written a book. Initially I was disappointed as the first few pages are disjointed and confusing (they would work well on film, but not in print), but I persevered and once the characters became more defined and the story clearer I really enjoyed the story. At times it is a little predictable, but often stories are, and I enjoyed it all the same. It's never going to be Stephen King, but if you feel like an interesting read when you have a couple of hours free one day, give it a go."
3,Craven - Fountain Society,"I didn't hold out much hope that Fountain Society would be anything other than an amusing, yet generic, thriller. In that respect I was not at all disappointed. Fountain Society is a cookie-cutter thriller. There's nothing about the novel that distinguishes it from hundreds of others. The plot is decent and interesting but nothing special. The characters are fairly two-dimensional and their dialogue is nothing special. In fact, one of the few things I found unique about the novel was the setting.Don't get me wrong - Fountain Society is not a BAD novel. It's just not overwhelmingly impressive either. It's entertainment. Nothing more."
3,Stick With What You Know,"I have finished almost every book I've ever started. Call it Obsessive/Compulsive or blame it on my English degree, but once I start a book, I have to finish it. I put down Fountain Society after chapter two only to find it later with a year's coat of dust. All I could think as I trudged through it again was ""This would make great movie."" There was just enough violence (imagine how Wes Craven would produce a scene with a guy being sucked out a plane window), just enough sex, and just enough plot--for a movie. Fountain Society wasn't a bad book--I've read much worse--but it would have made a better movie."
5,"Lyrical, Thoughtful and Educational","Waterlily is the story of two Sioux women, mother and daughter, and their relationships with their tribe and the larger world. Ms. Deloria's book is straightforward, with the negatives of Sioux life discussed quickly and without sentiment. Stories of tribal children being scalped or the inter-tribal warfare that goes on are almost treated as small ancillaries that do not affect the people. The main characters are described through their words and actions, more than through delving into their thoughts. This makes for a fast-paced book that shows in great detail a general, edenic version of Native American life before the European invasions and genocides. The Sioux are portrayed as brave, hardy people who live with an extensive tribal code of hospitality and interdependence. it is hard not to envy their ""tiyospaye"" in this disconnected, frenetic world and look with longing back to a slower, simpler time."
4,A good look into lesser known cultures,"I'm very into learning about Native American cultures, and Waterlily provides a look into the daily lives of the Dakota Souix people, particuarly that of the women. WARNING-this book is not meant to be exciting, it is a true-to-life novel. Even so, if you are interested in women's roles in early American culture, this book is for you."
4,Great easy reading of a remarkable nation,"I really enjoyed this book. I looked forward to reading it every chance I got. It was so interesting and easy to read that it seemed to take just hours to complete it. Right away the book starts with a courageous Lakota woman who manages to give birth to the main character, Waterlily, by herself. From there, you learn of an interesting group of people who have a love and respect for their kin in a way that I have never heard of."
4,EEEK? HOW OLD IS SHE?,"I really, TRULY love this book-exept that it is so fast paced that you can barely keep track of what age she is and who's alive and who's who! Stuff like that. Either way, check it out. You actually might like it alot!-Brenna-"
2,Not the Red Elvises' best,"The Red Elvises certainly have a unique sound -- a combination of Russian folk music and surf rock. Unfortunately, in this album they have wandered far afield from their early strengths. The fast and furious guitar work and innovative sounds of their earlier albums (especially ""Surfing in Siberia"" and ""I Wanna see You Bellydance"") have been replaced with a heavy-handed disco/techno beat that gets extremely repetitive after a while. About two thirds of the way through the album, I found myself wondering when it would end. I will admit that much of my disappointment with this album comes from my having very high expectations for it. I like the Red Elvises, but this is not their best album by a long shot."
2,Uneven,"I love this band (they are, after all, Your Favorite Band), but this cd gets the least play of any in their catalog."
3,Mindless fun.,"When a rambunctious brigade of vaguely ethnic keyboard rockers headed by a man named Oleg get together, you know SOMETHING's going to come of it. Despite somewhat explicit album titles, the music is utterly harmless and I must guess, in some instances, indeed better than sex. 200# of Pure Love is the most danceable novelty song I've ever heard, and while lyrically repetitive all the songs have a certain humorous sensibility. Surprisingly enough, it seems they can even play their instruments reasonably well. If you can keep your groove on while ""Everybody disco...like the boys in San Francisco!"" is repeated for the umpteenth time, this is a guaranteed perfect party album good any time you may need a pick-me-up. The act wears somewhat thin near the end, however, with more than one song about surfing the net. Third world pop rock would never be the same if these guys could only get some air time."
2,Nothing to write home about.,"Decent book, but nothing spectacular. Not a bad bit of entertainment but certainly not memorable."
2,Pre-teen fiction!,"Silly book, reminding me of my childhood favorite, Nancy Drew. As an adult reader, however, this book is childish, predictable driverish! A waste of time to read, unless you are 11 years old!"
4,"A chocolate-flavored cozy, nicely shaped.","It's not clear to me how many murder mysteries can take place inone small town in Michigan, but that's the only possible drawback I can seeto a long successful run to this new series, just started. All of theingredients are there: an blonde ex-trophy wife trying to restart her life,an aunt who owns a chocolate shop in a resort town along the Lake Michiganshore, assorted townspeople of various ages, character and temperament, andof course I mentioned chocolate, didn't I?Smoothly written and adeptly plotted, the book is a pleasure toread, with just enough suspects to make the mystery interesting, if notchallenging. There's a hint of romance by book's end as well, notunexpectedly. Those of you who are primarily hard-boiled private eye fanswill find the nourishment here mighty thin, but enthusiasts for cozies (youknow who you are) will eat this one right up."
2,disappointing...,"I like chocolate and I like mysteries so I was looking forward to this book. However, the main character Lee is very annoying. She is a former beauty queen who leaves her husband because he was cheating on her and goes to run her family chocolate shop because she doesn't know what else to do with herself. Her only flaw is she misspeaks; which I found very annoying. So much infact, it took away from the mystery. I didn't find her quirkiness endearing or even humorous. Then she has to explain to everyone she meets. However, she is self conscious about it. There are no reciepes only chocolate facts which are somewhat interesting but also disrupt the flow of the story."
3,Eh... not worth full price,"This mystery book was slightly entertaining, but the killer was excrutiatingly obvious from... oh, maybe the 4th chapter or so. My interest is piqued enough to want to read one or two more of her books to see if her writing style has advanced, but I will definitely not be buying it full price. Perhaps for $0.01 + s/h."
2,No mystery here...,"I knew who the killer was the whole time. The author needs to try not to make it so obvious. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the characters, but I can't stand a mystery that doesn't surprise me in the end. I probably won't continue reading this series.If her later books are less predictable (and I mean WAY less predictable) someone please let me know, because I am very disappointed."
5,I'm hooked on this new series.,"""The Chocolate Cat Caper"" is an easy quick read. The type of book I like to read while waiting in line or traveling via plane. The story is not very complicated, so it's a book that you can put down and come back to easily. However, after you start this book, you may not want to put it down.I could have done without the quirky habit the heroine has of substituting words with other words when she is nervous. However, the fact that the heroine is not perfect adds to her charm.A delightful first book in a series (Chocoholic Mysteries) of books that I look forward to reading."
2,Not Diane Mott Davidson,"Although I enjoy just about any mystery, this book's annoying ""hook"" makes it hard to read. The main character's quirk is that she misspeaks - often embarrassingly so - when stressed: ""goon"" instead of ""guard"", etc. I can't even tell you if it's a good mystery because this is so distracting. Also, to be honest, the chocolate trivia is not nearly as interesting as some good old recipes. It's not horrible but it's not great either."
4,A Treat,"The Chocolate Cat Caper is the first in the Chocoholic mystery series by JoAnna Carl. Like a candy bar, the book goes down easy and leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. Soon, you will want another (book, that is). The story is about former Texas trophy wife Lee McKinney as she begins a new life in a Michigan lakeside resort town. Lee helps her beloved Aunt Nettie run an upscale chocolate shop. At a catered affair at a wealthy but hated resident's home, the hated woman dies after ingesting Aunt Nettie's chocolates. A man from Lee's teenage past is the victim's widower. He clashes with the woman's personal assistant, who has taken the murder very hard. Can Lee exonerate her chocolate shop before it is forced to close from lack of business?This book would make a great TV episode a la Murder She Wrote. It is entertaining with a solid mystery for the reader to solve, but does not contain any very dark subject matter, sex, or profanity like so many other mystery series out there."
3,"Okay, but not extraordinary","This is a pretty good series. I like Aunt Nettie and the chocolate store (makes me hungry though!). Lee is an okay character, but her habit of using the wrong word in tight situations is just plain aggravating, not endearing or funny. It was fine when she was 16 in the very first story, but she's an adult and knows she has a problem, so she needs to get over it. I'll continue reading the books, but the word habit makes me want to thrown the book at the wall."
3,chocolate cats? where?,"bland, not that exciting, would not read again, too much like all the other chocolate books. Okay for a quick read"
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Looking for more culinary inspired mysteries.What impressed me: All you ever wanted to know about chocolate and more. For all that this book lacked in character development, it certainly proved the author's knowledge about chocolate, both its origins and the candy-making process. While I'll never be motivated enough to make my own chocolate, I really enjoyed reading about others doing it.What disappointed me: This was a very short, and therefore not all that in-depth, book. 230 pages in a rather large print doesn't give the reader much time to start caring for the main character or get really involved in the mystery itself. The romance angle felt both rushed and a bit forced as well.Recommended: Yes, but only if you really love cozy culinary mysteries and chocolate.Continue series:Yes. I already own the next 5 books in this series, so I'm going to give it another shot."
1,boring movie,This movie should not be taken seriously. It not even the quality of a Hallmark Christmas movie. At least it was free.
1,Boring.,I found this to be just another boring Christmas movie that works fine for background noise while you are busy working on other things.
2,Kids film showing how a Black jailer started Xmas,"This is a good story and I recommend it for Afro-Americans children and other minorities to give them a feeling that Christmas belongs to them too, because of the efforts of Pete. After St Nicolas is sent to jail for being a spy and decides to give up his gift giving quest, his Black jailer springs him from prison and convinces him to restart and expand his giving. Where Nick gets all this money, toys and chocolate is never discussed. But it's a kids film, don't look for logic. If you are looking for Christ in this ""christmas"" video, it ain't there. However, I am sure kids of all ages and ethnicities will enjoy this video."
3,"Great movie, but bad discs","I recorded this movie off of one of the TV networks several years ago and my family watches it every year. As soon as I saw that it was available on DVD, I ordered it. I had to return the disc because it had several BAD glitches throughout the movie. Amazon sent a replacement copy, but it had the same glitches in the same places. Apparently these discs were created from a bad master. Hopefully this will be corrected. No complaints about the movie or Amazon.com, but I am very disappointed, I really want this on DVD."
3,Good Story,"This was a good story that I hadn't heard before. Started out slow but got better. James Earl Jones, as you would expect, is a great story teller."
2,Not really a good grown up movie,Not that the movie is bad - just not much there for an adult. Fine for maybe 12 and under.
3,"""Think 1989"" is alone worth the price.","For hard core Aretha fans, ""Think 1989"" is worth the price of admission. She's really cooking on this one, singing at the top of her voice like she just doesn't care.The rest of the album is average, and sometimes quite silly ... the James Brown and Whitney Houston duets come to mind. But ""Think"" and Aretha's own composition ""He's The Boy"" are winners. Buy it for these two classics and the Elton John duet title track.Note: ""Mercy"" is a mediocre song but worth listening to for some interesting things that Aretha does with her voice.Overall, this is one of those albums that confirms that even in the midst of passable material, the Queen's talent still shines."
3,"""After The Storm"" would have been a better title.","Unfortunately this album's production, choice of material and overall presentation are much too similar to what's found on 1985's ""Who's Zoomin'Who"". Only Franklin's glorious duet with The Four Tops' ""If Ever A Love There Was"" and the jazzy ballad ""He's The Boy"" manage to not sound dated. Aretha's producers and Arista label boss Clive Davis simply couldn't come up with the right material for her on this set."
3,If you are into Giallo,"If you're into Giallo...this is an average ""Giallo"". I would recommend seeing ones like: ""Night Train Murders"", ""Death Carries a Cane"", ""The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh"", ""Tenebrae"".As for Redemption dvds, I cannot stand the stupid ""gothic chick"" into and image. It's so cheesy, late night Cinemax softcore looking. Not cute at all! It's just annoying that Redemption thought it was a good idea. I also hate some of their dvd covers. Does not go with the film at all."
4,Book Synopsis,"Although this is not my favorite Wanda Owens book, I did enjoy the richness in both the characters and the historical details in this story. Setting forth on a treacherous journey across the high seas with a dashing lover ... if you've got an afternoon by the pool or on the beach, this might be a perfect book to take along!Publisher: Zebra HeartfirePublish Date: February 1990Book Description:Tiffany Renaud loved her life as the only daughter of a wealthy Parisian industrialist. She had suitors, servants and a ball gown in every color of the rainbow. The last thing she wanted was to cross the ocean on a cramped and stuff ship just to visit the uncivilized wilds of America! Then she met the handsome shipping magnate Chad Morrow, and as Chad caressed her silken skin, she knew she would gladly trade the glittering ballrooms of Paris for a stateroom on the high seas with the man she loved."
4,Nice Bench,"I got this as an addition to an oversized table with only 4 chairs. It does not match the color perfectly but it is hard to match online and I could not find any retailers in my area (Birmingham, AL) that had benches. It is also a great price as these are around $200-300 elsewhere. It is sturdy and is a good piece of furniture."
3,"Not classic, but good","This new cd is not classic Mr. Big, but I like it anyway. I was sad to hear that Paul Gilbert left the band, but Ritchie Kotzen is an apt successor.I'm glad to see the band is continuing, even though it seems like they are a little more laid back on this cd. Usually the first track of a Mr. Big cd is a barnstorming opener, but not this time. I valued Eric Martin's voice the most this time out."
3,What's Missing Here?.......,"....Paul Gilbert. Don't get me wrong. Ritchie Kotzen is a above average guitarist and a good all-around musician and songwriter. I enjoyed his work with Poison on the album ""Native Tounge"". But, he just does not have the talent of Paul Gilbert, in terms of both playing and writing. Nothing against Ritchie, that's just the way it is.As far as the album's content goes, the songs ""Superfantastic"", ""Static"", ""Electrified"", ""A Rose Alone"" and ""My New Religion"" are the primary standouts, with Eric Martin's voice showing newfound maturity and growth. Billy Sheehan is, as always, great. Pat Torpey also shows musical growth on this album.So overall, this album is good. It's not Mr. Big's best work, but I'd say it's worlds better than anything I've seen on MTV in he last three years. Pick it up and enjoy."
3,Close to Great,"I used to be a big fan of Mr. Big but the sameness of Eric Martin's voice in every song got tiring. He needs to stop trying to cool-up the songs with excessive ""yeah""s ,""oh yeah""s and ""alright""s. He has and excellent voice and sings with real feeling; I just think he should be more real. Richie Kotzen is a guitarist who stands well above most of the current talent. I appreciate his blues influence and his contribution to this album. He does not, however, have the incredible talent of Paul Gilbert, whom he replaces. And in my opinion, no one does. Mr. Gilbert is able to add complex chord progressions that complement the melody without actually following it. He is a master. Now don't get me wrong, I like the album, not my favorite, but I won't give up onMr. Big yet."
5,Fun and good old fashioned rock and roll!,"I am kicking myself for not knowing who Mr. Big was before buying the Tak Matsumoto Group album and wondering who the singer was. I thought he was a young kid but no, he's a year older than me and been around for the eighties and nineties rock roller coaster. I couldn't afford the one ""Actual Size"" that isn't on MP3 list but I now own all the other studio albums. I am enjoying the great vocals and fun rock songs. Eric Martin is now my favorite rock and roll singer! He just has a great range and power that just electrifies the songs. I hope that ""What If..."" is not the last album for this awesome band!"
4,nice dress watch,"I have had this watch for several years now and have been very pleased with it. The jeweler was able to remove enough links to make it fit my small wrists, which is often a problem for me. Two-tones make it match both gold and silver jewelry. The watch is casual enough for everyday and dressy enough for going out."
3,Buy superglue,"My little boy loves this toy, but the car would always come apart while he played with it. So after weeks of putting this toy together over and over, I got tired of it and superglued the pieces onto the car. This for the most part solved the problem. The only other concern I have with this car is the tail fins are really sharp and my little boy(who pushes the car around) has hurt himself by falling on them."
2,I should have listened!!!!!,"Please do not buy this toy for a child under the age of 9 or 10. I read the other reviews that said what a piece of junk this toy is but I thought ""They can't all be like that"". And my 5 year old is such a Batman nut that he would love this toy. But it is an absolute waste of money. It constantly falls apart. I tried to Super Glue the pieces together but it still doesn't work. My son ends up frustrated and in tears. This toy was definitely not worth the money."
3,Not impressed,"We bought this TOY for our son who is a Batman junkie to PLAY WITH! What I do not understand is this Batmobile is sold in the TOY SECTION although it has not been built for play! It would be great to put up on a shelf and look at, the details or amazing but no 4 year old is going to do that! The ""jet pack"" does not stay on the batmobile or Batman! The rear tail of it is extremely sharp which makes it near impossible to push around on the floor & they continually fall off and we have to reattach them!! I would love to see a line of BATMAN TOYS THAT CAN BE PLAYED WITH instead of sitting high on a shelf!! If our son was not so attached to this batmobile we would take it back and get something different! If you are buying this to play with, keep searching!!"
2,6'' figures Do Not fit!,"My six year old son,who loves cars,had to have this for his collection. After putting it together and not having figures to put in the car we rushed out to get Batman and Robin. No Robin anyplace and two different batman's[6""]did not fit in seats. Legs were too wide for passenger seat and top would not close down over figure in driver's seat. Figure's were returned and considering returning the batmobile too! Wasted much of my time running around searching and returning."
2,Mommy can you please fix this!,"I bought this toy for my son on his fifth birthday. He had been wanting it for a while and his enthusiasm was short lived when he finally got it. He lost most of the pieces right away and the parts that are not lost continue to fall off of the mobile. Also, the car is so low to the ground that it can not be pushed across the carpet without the fins getting snagged. I wish I would have known that it was not intended to be played with before I bought it."
2,Beware of sharp objects!,"After we took this out of the box, we couldn't believe how sharp and rigid the tail pieces were. We cut off the points to make the ends blunt for a little piece of mind seeing that it would be in the hands of a four year old. But why should the consumer need to spend a great deal of money on a child's toy and then have to make it safer? And finally-WHERE IS ROBIN? What a brilliant idea to create a special pull out section for an impossible to find sidekick!"
2,Falls apart,"I always falls apart, and my son stops playing with it once it does, it was one of his Christmas gifts, and I think it was the worst because the parts just fall off during play time."
3,"I'll Take This ""B"" Movie Over A Coma Anyday","I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi movies over the years. This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road. You just can't remember.All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"". This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma."
1,Would prefer ascending bowel cancer for Christmas,"My house loves Christmas movies. For the entire month of late-November/December (yes, it's a month), we watch Christmas movies as often as we can.Little did we know what we were getting into when we picked this up from the local library.The country that puts Boxing Day on our calendars sucks the spirit of Christmas out of our very marrow with this poorly written, poorly drawn, poorly animated, poorly voiced, poorly concieved abomination. No go, eh?"
1,Did not capture my daughter's interest,"She put this dvd in and watched for about 2 minutes, and wanted to stop it. I also did not feel this DVD to be entertaining."
4,"Good wheels, not great wheels.","These Replacement Lawn Mower Wheels for MTD # 734-1860 , 734-1871 have a very strong rubber/chemical smell out of the box. It might be good to store them outside for a while until the odor-chemical dissipates.The wheels look strong and capable for their purpose, but they are somewhat wobbly in their rotation, and if the wheels are to fit very closely to the mower housing, they might rub. They are true to round. For my purposes they work well."
2,How short can you get,"This documentary had the ability to be up there with popcorn suttons, ""the last one"". Except the producers totally bombed it. Some good stories, but I thought this was supposed to be about moonshine.?.? don't waste your time, right when you sit down you're getting back up to cut the tv off, 22 minutes, are u fin kidding me. That's like a dollar a minute."
4,I expected just a little more,"It's a good book, don't get me wrong, it just doesn't going into the depths I would have liked of these women's pasts. It routinely portrays them as victims of their situations and a pawn for their husband/boyfriend/lovers plans instead of a willing participant. Surely not all of these women are as frail as they are made out to be"
2,"Interesting subject, poor writing.","The subject of female serial killers is utterly fascinating but unfortunately this author cannot write well. Even the editing of this book is atrocious! I counted over 200 typos, spelling errors, and inaccurate punctuation in the first 4 chapters. It is a very difficult book to read due to the sloppy, even crude writing style. I give her two stars for her effort and her research but I think this author needs to polish her writing skills."
2,Not so sure about this,"I purchased this looking ahead to some family get-togethers and larger family reunions. I had hoped it would initiate some fun discussions about family history and fond remembrances. It scares me a bit,though. Some of the question categories relate to family secrets and skeletons in the closet. I'm not so sure I want to dredge up things like that at my family reunion."
5,One great book.,"Like all the books in this series ""Reptiles and Amphibians"" gives a species by species look at a huge variety of creatures. From Chameleons to Cobras this book has a great selection. There are not many field guides out there with such fantastic and detailed photos so I suggest it for anyone who loves the to some ""unlovable"" slimy or scaly creatures of our world."
5,Very informative,"My sons love this book. It is meant to be a reference book, not a read from cover to cover book, but they could not put it down."
1,What a junk pile,"This thing has the quality of something out of a grocery store gumball machine.It is cheap plastic. You open it up and you can see visible flashing at the parting lineright in the threads. So I expected it to leak out the threaded connection. I installedit, and I was wrong. It leaked out the stem!! Shame on Plumb Craft."
1,Worthless,"Cheap plastic. Leaks through the valve and around the valve stem. I installed it, tested it, and then tossed it. Won't be buying their products again."
1,Useless,Made of plastic and unfortunately will not fit a shower head or the pipe coming out of the wall.It's inexpensive but will not work.Buy metal. I bought a stainless one from Amazon and it works fine.
3,Needs some improvements but...,"It works for when you need a break to lather up. However, it leaks and the black shut off is loose and water quirts out from around it when you turn the valve."
3,Mostly a puff piece for the car,"If you are serious about buying the car, then why not spend the six bucks for this article. However, it's 90% puff piece, 10% good info. The half page listing potential trouble spots is really the only valuable section."
3,hard work but worth it,An amazing bit of scientific research based on a new way of assessing the taxonomic relationship of the birds. Still not completely accepted by the birder community but it should be. I just wish they'd release a less scientifically weighty version. Who needs all those melting point curves!
4,My opinions about Dear Ellen Bee,"I read the book Dear Ellen Bee. It is by Mary E. Lyons and Muriel M. Branch. I would give this book four stars because it was good but there is not a lot of adventure. The story is about a young black girl named Miss Bet. She wants to became a teacher so she moves to a big city and she can not wait to go home, sence she is almost finshied school. When she is done with school she can not go home because something has happen to her home. They are taking the blacks for slaves so she has to stay there and try to be careful of her life. If you want to know what happens then you have to read the book for your self. I would recammend this book to 13-16 year olds because it is really hard to understand at first. I hope you read this book for your self so you can see how good it is."
5,Excellent quality and value,"I bought this as high quality paper, which also shipped for free. I have not found any paper that has the same quality for any price close to this. It is 24 lb, and very white. It has that nice professional crisp feel to the paper when holding a few sheets. I'm in an online masters of science class and read and write a lot of papers. This paper has been very servicable.I did not have any trouble with the paper being damaged during shipment, nor were there any torn or open packages with bent edges. I don't know if that is luck, but generally, my packages arrive in good condition. This was no exception.To be succinct, when I get low on paper, I will not need to shop any further, I will just re-purchae this paper again."
5,This professional paper,"There is something about printing something on a bit heavier paper. This paper is bright, solid and professional. Every printout is crisp and it's much more durable than your standard 20 pound paper. I have replaced all my regular cheap copy paper with this and people notice when you hand them something. This paper works well for home office and small business as well. Invoices and flyers will stand out and give you that professional edge."
3,Great... if you have tiny arms,"The MP3 case is nice , well made. The armband is only big enough if you are a Woman or prepubescent Boy. I am a pretty big guy ( 6'1, 225lbs ) but by no means "" Huge "" and there is no way this thing is coming close to fitting over my bicep. The case is nice enough that I decided to keep it and give the armband to my daughter..."
4,"Satisfied, especially for the price","Received the product in a timely fashion. It fits well and I have had no problems running and using the arm band. No sliding, etc."
2,"Armband unusable, case OK","It is very hard to feed the end of the armband through the slot for it (too wide for the slot, really). There's no way I could get it positioned comfortably by myself, as I must feed it through the slot *before* putting it on my arm, and I want to put it over the sleeve of my t-shirt. Can't be done without help.Armband is also quite small for me, although I must admit I have large upper arms. Still, I imagine some muscle-bound guys' are larger, even though theirs would be muscle rather than my fat.On the upside, the actual Sansa case is quite a bit lighter than my current one, so I am putting the Sansa in that case and clipping it to the neck of my t-shirt for exercise. Not what I pictured, but it will work.Both the armband and the case seem well constructed, but that doesn't matter much if it won't work as intended.It would probably be fine if you had small arms or had help to put it on, but it's a 2-star for me."
5,Great Holster.,This item is great. My Sansa e250 slid right in with no fuss. The plastic screen cover is great. I personally don't care if it scratches too easily. It's better than scratching the player. The control cut-out is a little smaller than it should be but it didn't make it too hard to use. The arm band works good. I don't run or jog but it stayed put on the eliptical and weight sets. The thick construction offers some protection from falls and the belt clip works as it should. Will definitly buy another if the need ever arises.
2,Nothing Special,"The fit is very tight.The view panel scratched easily.The control cut is not large enough to operate the play, forward, reverse and settings buttons.The tight fit makes the power button too sensitive.Not really worth the listed price. I seen better holsters in the 99 store."
3,You get what you pay for ...,Difficult to add/remove the arm band.Difficult to turn OFF the player once in the holster
4,"Great case, well designed",Fits my Sansa perfectly. I like how the integrated belt clip slides into the arm band. Simple and smart. Recommended. Gave it 4-stars because it's a bit pricey for what you get. Should be a few bucks cheaper.
2,UPSET AT AMAZON,I bought a sansa fuse and this was marketed to me that it is good with a fuse but it is NOT it is clearly for a view or something else.
4,Satisfied,"I payed 18 bucks and feel I got a very good value. The perks for this case to me is that I enjoy the armband for running, but you can also use the case by itself without the armband for all purpose holding of the player, and has a belt-clip too. It is a little difficult to get to the buttons if you have larger fingers, but I only found this to be a minor issue, and with limited choices for Sansa players, I think you are going to find this is one of the best for price and function."
5,Belkin Sansa E200 Series Holster w/ Removable Armand - Black,"I've owned this for a little over six months. The case is awesome. I keep it on my Sansa all the time. I'm a big girl though and the armband is still a little too tight for me to wear. When I work out, walk, or mow grass, I just clip the case to my waistband and it stays on just fine. I hope to be able to wear the armband comfortably in the near future. :)"
4,Belkin Sansa Holster,"Very happy with purchase. Bought to use with belt clip only.Not for use with the armband.Seems to protect the device well when in my pocket with headphones wrapped around it.Used on a plane trip and happy that I had purchased it as the Sansa E250 is small an slippery if put in a shirt pocket, pants pocket and or on the airline fold down tray. The clip held securely."
4,good function,"The armband functions as advertised. The neoprene band is adjustable and does well with sweat and moisture. The player holster is OK, a bit awkward to get your fat finger into the dial for pressing the keys, but I did it. Even tougher while running. Once you are off and going, you don't need the ""hold"" button on the Sansa, since you can't really accidentally push any of the buttons. Leaving the hold in the off position allows you to adjust volume on the move, or easily turn it down if someone actually tries to talk to you with headphones on...Well made, very functional, adjustable for python guns or pencil arms. Does a good job. Good protection for the player in the holster. Tough to get the clip on the band sometimes, but that was the only negative."
2,Ugh!,"I really wanted to like this story. It sounded interesting and different.Instead, I got to read about a sullen, uninteresting and completely screwed up teeanagers in the 1970's.Kind of boring and very typical. There was not a redeeming feature in any of the characters and the storyline was stilted and rigid.Not a good read."
3,"""Young Adult"" book less satisfying for ""Old Adult""","I purchased this book second-hand so it was not found in a ""young adult""(YA) section. Upon finishing the book I read the author bio, the book jacket, and the Amazon reviews and found it was intended for a YA audience. This makes sense, and the YA audience likely would not scrutinize it as much as I, a not-young adult.For me, the book was an easy read but I wanted depth that just didn't emerge. I understood the overall story arc (very clear), and thought that the main character was believable and the outcome believable as well. I just wanted a story that read more deply for my inquiring adult mind. That said, I presume the subject matter was explored at the right level for the intended audience who may relate to the main character and may not need or want greater levels of (probably horrifying) detail."
2,Please Jail Jailbait,"The begining premise of this novel is intriguing--a young friendless teen becomes involved with an older man--it does not fulfil it's side of the bargain.Newman opens her story with a quote she overheard at a coffee shop: ""Please, that girl knew exactly what she was getting into."" From this quote one would hope Newman's novel would disprove the myth that young girls always understand the consequences sexual involvement with older men can bring.She does not dispell this myth.In fact, her novel proves that these misguided children know the consequences of their actions ane embrass the effects. That is, until they get hurt.I found Newman's novel bland, boring and basicly blah. There was no reason to set the novel in 1971. The character does not change for none of the desisions in the book are made by her. She is a puppy dog being led through life, giving women a bad name.It is a disapointing novel which no teen girl should ever be lead to read."
2,Too thin to keep feet hot for long...,"I sent these back for the same reason I sent the matching mitts back - not enough lavender filling. Again, only heats one side of the foot. The way they look in the photo, it looks like the filling is surrounding the foot but it isn't. Very disappointed."
3,Good if you have the time,"This item definitely required adult help for assembly. The paint and the glue that came with it were dried up and unusable, which was disappointing. However, the child who received it really likes it as he is very into trains, and loved seeing it be built (by his father)."
5,good product,"We liked the boots, but had to return because of the wrong size, although I did check the sizing chart."
3,Lulu - a little soul in your heart,"Although I have been a huge Lulu fan throughout the years (I have just about everything she has recorded), I found this CD disappointing. The songs are mostly favorites of the '60s, yet, I found the overall sound too much like something she may have recorded back in 1968 -well done, but somewhat dull, especially following her releases in the '90s and later."
5,Great Movie,One of Pedro Infante's best comedies. I love his movies for the clean comedy. It is the one to buy if you are looking to laugh and have an ejoyable evening.
5,Indispensable for the Professional,"I recommend ""Professional Genealogy: A Manual for Researchers, Writers, Editors, Lecturers, and Librarians"" as a first reading for someone considering setting up a genealogist practice, or for someone preparing for genealogist certification.Provides practical information on a variety of important fronts. Chapters written by outstanding professionals, and very readable. It is a hefty hardback, quite comprehensive in scope, and well worth the price.Even if you have been a professional genealogist for a few years, as I have, ""Professional Genealogy"" is a benefit."
4,Professional Genealogy,"The product was exactly as advertised, and in much better condition than I had expected. I was very happy with the product, and felt I got full value for the price paid."
2,Professional Genealogy,Obviously this book was designed for the professional and is written for the professional. The amateur genealogist could be easilly snowed with all the technical jargon but once you get past these aspects there are a few things that are of value.Any amateur seeking help could do better by purchasing another source.
4,They're fine...they're dishcloths,"Not much to say about greatness of dishcloths. I wanted organic, so I got these. They work pretty much how a dishcloth works. I didn't give them 5 stars because I bought some bamboo dish towels that I absolutely love, so I think it just may be possible to make a better dishcloth. But no complaints."
1,Are they really 100% cotton,"I've washed these twice. They however, do not absorb like my older cotton dishcloths.I am considering returning them since I don't believe they are 100% cotton as the label suggests."
3,Fair movie.,It is no big budget blockbuster but better than some. I have seen better and some worse. The best part were all the written words by historic figures.
1,Avoid at all costs!,"This movie is terrible. Perhaps you should not judge a movie by its cover. You certainly can't here. The cover has army guys, Apache helicopters, explosions, and at least a hint of DaVinci Code coolness. The movie itself actually has none of this!! Literally no army guys, no Apache helicopters, no explosions, and not a wiff of DaVinci Code coolness.The plot is full of holes and the acting and writing are stiff. The funniest part about the whole thing is for some reason a person (maybe the director himself) wrote a few dozen fawning and glowing reviews (10 stars!) over at imdb. A conspiracy indeed."
4,Timely and well done,"This story really makes you think. It involves a shadowy government anti-terrorist department with unlimited powers investigating a private company in the encryption business. It points out the dangers of too much government power in this area. It is well-acted by David Warner, and the locales (Florida and Bahamas) provide a lush backdrop."
1,DULLSVILLE,"If you're ever up late one night and you can't fall asleep, slip this yawner into your DVD player and you'll probably fall asleep after the opening credits.This preponderously dull, hokey drama asserts that there is an ancient code that scientifically proves there's a God. Ho-hum; the action moves sluggishly and non-actor Jim Fitzpatrick and usually good ones such as Maria Conchita Alonso and David Warner walk through their roles obligatorily but it's all just one big bore."
3,All over the map.,"Mike Watt is a great bassist, very underrated. This outing is all over the musical map and while that's admirable, it makes for a very inconsistant CD. To me, this set doesn't have any focus due to the fact that there are so many guest muscians (great though they may be). However, there are quite a few good songs on here, notably ""Big Train"", ""Against the '70s"", E-Ticket Ride"" and the Funkadelic cover ""Maggot Brain"" among others."
2,"Television fans, go gently","Even after a number of listens, I can't really find a way into this. Verlaine is not, and never has been, an outstanding lyricist, and with the vocals relatively up front here, this is an issue. The guitar is still striking, with numerous lovely pieces, but doesn't sound particularly new; the album sounds quite a bit like the last Television album. Verlaine's first solo album, Warm and Cool, has a superior atmosphere and overall sound. Nice, jazz-inflected songs like ""A Stroll"" would make perfectly acceptable background music for a lazy luncheon, and this is where this album belongs, unobtrusively, pleasently, in the background. Either the end of the album is weak, or I'd had enough of the record, because ""Shingaling"" and ""All Weirded Out"" sounded dreadful, faux-hip and faking it, and by the time I reached the penultimate ""The Day on You"" I was worn out. Still love Television though, more than ever."
3,"but, it IS tom verlaine!","this is not tom verlaine, the punk guitar god of old ...this is all very calm and VERY mellow ...what saved this for me was IT IS tom verlaine!you can hear the twang and that sound that's he!so, how bad could it be?couple of the songs actually jump out at you.he sings a little better ... too.but tom verlaine's a guitar player first and foremeost.not THAT bad."
5,Works,USed it on my guinea pigs and it works. They had lice when I got them. I treated them with this stuff and it killed them quickly without irritating their eyes.
3,"Could do better, but the idea is cute","The concept of this toy is cute. I bought it for my daughter when our second baby came along, so she could follow along with all of the gadgets. The problem is that this set isn't built too well and if you accidentally knock it off the table, there is no way you're going to be able to assemble it all back. The crib keeps falling apart and there are a BIZZILLION little pieces to lose. It would be better if it came with a ""room"" that could close back up for storage."
4,Gave as a gift,I gave this as a gift to the grandparents. They enjoy puzzles and found the extra story aspect to be fun as well. The only problem with puzzles is once they are done they are done (no replay value).
2,self-birthday present!,"I ordered this pen & pencil set on my birthday, which I was probably not unconscious of. A birthday present to myself.Bad choice. A clerk in a local stationer's explained to me that Cross - formerly a reliable manufacturer & purveyor of fine writing instruments - had hit upon the idea of a single body for both pen & pencil - which presumably saves money in manufacturing - with only the insides different. A first disadvantage is that looking down at the two objects in my shirt pocket, a pen and a pencil, they are indistinguishable: can't tell one from the other. A second disadvantage is that the lead-feed for the pencil regularly infuriates me: it takes forever for the lead to find its way into the channeling sleeve & for it to appear & be writeable-with. Pen & pencil have heft, that's undeniable, they weigh enough for the price. But do they work???Beware!"
5,Great baby book,"I really like this baby book and ended up buying it after seeing all the pages in a store. It has all the pages you want it to have for haircut, pictures, firsts, etc. It doesnt have envelopes for the hair but my last one didnt either. The brag book that compliments this is also very cute.The only thing I would have liked is for it to be a 3 ring binder book instead of a bound book so you could add more pages. If Carters was smart, they would come up with a matching 12x12 scrapbook album; I would have bought that as well!"
3,"Not that good, not as bad","When i got the dvd i wasnt expecting a good movie at all based on reviews but the movie wasnt completely horrible. I thought Uma Thurman was really amazing in her first ever acting role, and Steve Buscemi is incredible when he shows up for an appearance and makes the film hilarious. The directing sucked my third nipple, and the end of the movie was really poorly written. Only recomended to Uma fans and if you wanna see Steve Buscemi in a hilarious minor role. 2.5/5"
3,B-Grade flick with brother of famous actor,"I'll bet Matt Dillon's parents are pi**ed that they didn't have one child per year to infiltrate the film industry with tough guy silent types in leather jackets. as it is all we got is Matt, Kevin and now Paul!"
2,Disappointing Christmas DVD,"A nice story but a very amateurish, cheap production..Even the voiceovers are weak. The story is nice but the narration is so annoying and the voice of the ""bad woman"" is so annoying and she is so evil that I don't think it is a ""feel good"" Christmas show at all. Would not recommend it."
5,Excellent book on bamboo fences,"Even if you have not been to Japan, this very informative book shows you all the variety there is in bamboo fences. Excellent photography, well defined chapters, clear instructions, but recommended only for serious bamboo fence enthusiasts. Good price, good value."
4,Quite entertaining!,"I brought this book with me on a long car trip and found it ideal reading, and very interesting and well-written. The author hitchhikes (mostly) across the U.S.A. after doing same some 20 years ago in his hippie days. He has some anxiety but finds his fears overblown. (Truthfully, this kind of book really, really, really makes one want to chuck everything, the house, the mate, the kids, the job, and just hit the open road. I mean this.) He meets kind and interesting people, too. I would compare this book to the writings of Bill Bryson, though without Bryson's humor. I only wish the book was longer!"
4,Entertaining but did miss the spot at times,"To summarise, an entertaining read over about 2 weeks worth of pre-sleep reading. As a fan of road-trip-esque books, I was looking forward to this jaunt around the country. Brooks has an entertaining style of writing that, for the most part, was clear and understandable. His research and fact-finding is a little ropey, naming Keystone, Wyoming as a chapter when in fact Keystone is in South Dakota for example.Sure he didn't exactl hitch all the way but give the guy credit, he sure did hitch a lot of the way. If you can get past the errors, you'll be left with an enjoyable read."
2,High hopes dashed!,"I had high hopes for this book but was ultimately disappointed. I admittedly read this book some years ago but what has stuck with we all this time is that the author spent half of his time ""hitchhiking"" across the country in his photographers car. I'm not sure it can technically be called hitchhiking if you know the person doing the driving! The premise certainly had potential but the author didn't capitalize on it!"
5,All my old favorites!,"I love this - and can't believe it was just five bucks! Sure, I got it under the guise of ""it's for my 10 month old son"" but, let's face it- he won't be watching much for a while so there was really no reason other than to get it for myself for me to purchase this now. All the episodes I remember from when I was a kid are there and non of that ""digitally remastered"" mularkey. Also, no editing for content- so they dabble in the politically incorrect from time to time. Great, nostalgic, cheap fun."
3,Can't get enough Gumby,"This is classic Gumby. I believe it covers episodes from all 3 decades. The ones from the 50's are a little slow and the picture quality is not great, but my grandchildren still enjoyed them. My grandson ins into monsters and aliens and loves the episode with the clay blob and Marshall Dill Pickle. He always wants a pickle while he watches it!!Introduce your little ones to some fun from your childhood.If you like this one I recomend The Gumby Movie. The kids love the music video with the Clayboys and the picture quality is good. The action is just right to keep them entertained."
4,Gumby's Greatest Adventures,This movie was very cute and pretty entertaining for the price. Delivery was fast.
4,A Great Stoll though my childhood,"I was moved to buy this for it's low price and loved Gumby and Pokey as a kid. I was curious about the quality of the DVD. These are the cartoons that I grew up with and look and sound great. There are 10 episodes on the disk which make for about an hour of Gumby and Pokey. My little one loves these and I still get a kick of of em. Can't say my older kids like them too much but the little one begs to watch. The only thing missing is the Theme Song. It just does not seem the same without ""If you got a heart then Gumby's a part of you"". All and all worth my money for a little Gumby."
4,nice,"cheap, cute, gumby. I bought this as a birthday present for my brother (13). We both thought it was a fun way to watch the gumby we remembered from when we were little. It only has 10 episodes but its cheaper than buying the boxed set so its nice for a quick dose of gumby."
3,Have some 80's nostalgia,"In spite of this film being slightly annoying (partly for Geena Davis's character, partly for the tacked-on music), it has redeeming values that make it worth at least a watch, and a trip back into 80's Space.The best parts are the hilarious Julie Brown songs, 'I Like 'Em Big and Stupid', and 'Cuz I'm a Blonde'. If the rest of the movie gets on your last nerve, just skip to the Julie Brown songs, and it will be worth the price you paid! It's too bad much of the editing that took place for the movie took out Julie stuff, which is why you should get the DVD, to have access to the deleted scenes.Other highlights are a delicious and silent Jeff Goldblum, and Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans, when you knew them when. Also check out the always-appealing Michael McKean as a pool-cleaning Surf Bum.Combine all that with lots of 80's color and glam, and you've got a fun little trip on their alien ship."
3,Fun from space!!!,"A great crazy little movie,if your in the mood for a movie that you don,t have to think and to help get your mind off of your day. Has great actors lots of fun and singing to. Geena Davis is supurb as a flake. I really enjoyed it hope you do to."
5,So Cool,"With such a great cast, 80's special effects, aliens, and great music what else could it be but great!?"
3,"Freeway of luv,laughter and aliens","Julien Temple (the Director) is a Brit and apparantly quite impressed with the California landscape and The Valley in particular (quite understandable as this turf is God's gift to earth!) and it shows in his movie. The panoramic shots, the freeway, the strip malls, the ocean, the beach bunnies, you get the picture. This is the part of the movie I like! Actually, I also like the characters (the aliens), and the dance scenes, but the story is thin, way thin. It's almost like a series of video CD's clipped together - well, that's Temple's background, he's done the Rolling Stones and like, and here he is making a movie! Monty Python it's not, but it's a laugh, sometimes a good laugh!"
5,Great comedy,This movie has a lot of big name stars and even aVJ from when MTv actually played music videos! Very funny and interesting premise. Worth a look!
1,"Bad acting, bad plot.","Would not waste any time on this. Thank goodness it was a free watch on Prime. Still wasted my time, even though I gave up after less than 30 minutes."
3,"Trash, but funny trash!","But hey, sometimes that's just what you need. Great price - why not buy it? I did..."
3,Earth Girls are Easy,"I was very pleased with the speed that the DVD arrived in my mailbox after order. It arrived in great shape and good time. :)Overall, the movie itself was not one of my favorites. It focused too much on sex and society's stereotypes of men and women. It did have some funny lines, such as, ""I'm a cupcake, eat me!"" Other than that, this film does not rate very high on my 'watch again' list."
4,airhead stuff,this is just one of those movies that you like even if they don't challenge you intelectually. i liked it. the songs are stupid-funny and it's so cool to see these big actors when they were just starting. i thought that jim carey and damon wayans were really funny in this. i also thought jeff goldblum did a great job of acting and i didn't pay any attention to the fact that he's really hot (sure).
3,This must be based on a true story,"Faced with all kinds of problems from infidelity to broken nails Valerie's (Geena Davis) troubles have just began as aliens invade her pool. She must help them acclimate to our way of life. Soon the aliens learn that earth girls are easy.They say that truth is stranger than fiction. This movie is awfully strange so it must be true. The ""out of the area"" visitors are easy to keep track of when they are color-coded. The songs were great and relevant.All of the main actors went on to bigger and I guess you can say better movies. Another early Jim Carrey movie is ""Once Bitten"" (1985). The best Julie Brown movie is ""Out There"" (1995), where she describes certain alien appendages as being curved like the space-time continuum.This is one of those movies that you may want to put on again in the background. And look up in time for your favorite parts.Out There Starring: Bill Campbell, Wendy Schaal"
5,Great Buy!,"Forgot about this movie, until I seen it again on tv and had to buy it. Love 80s movies and this is one of my favorites. Jeff Goldblum is gorgeous in this movie, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans are perfect for this movie. Jim Carrey looks great as a surfer dude! Great Find and Buy!"
4,Don't miss out!,"This is the first movie that features Jim Carrey in it. It is very crazy and creative. Also, it has Damon Wayans and Geena Davis. Which you are expecting to be a comedy. And it is. I hope you don't miss out on this because it's lives back then. I know almost every movie or series Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans have been in and it's not only about them.... IT's for the whole movie. It's unexpectable."
2,"YEAH SURE. 5 STARS, WHATEVER","Its really a ""satire"" like movie with some funny scenes. I dident mind those dumb songs either. The songs passed the time quicker for the film to be shorter. Earth Girls makes no sense and is just silly from start to finish. I love Geena Davis's creepy and scary neighbor. She freaks me out."
1,JUST PLAIN BAD,"How so many people could give a positive review to a movie that is written, directed and especially acted as badly as this is beyond me. My guess is that most of them were teenagers when this came out and have a kind of soft for it. Unfortunately, that soft spot is in their heads."
2,Disappointing-lacks that spark,"Bought this album based on the glowing 5 star reviews and my love of Blues-rock. It's mediocre at best. The guitar licks are ok if uninspired.Lyrics and songwriting are abysmal-dull,repetitive, just wander aimless going nowhere...If interested in this genre try: Doyle Bramhall II or of course, Robin Trower"
5,a superb discussion of a difficult topic,"This is an excellent book which thoroughly and sensitively covers a topic that is difficult for someone raised in U.S. culture to talk about. I am an anthropologist so I have the edge in terms of cultural relativism, but I think that anyone interested in the reality of this topic (rather than the sensationalist approach) would find this book compelling. I highly recommend it for personal or course use."
4,Had to read for class,"One of the better books my professors have made me read. Very detailed, sometimes I was a little grossed out but overall enjoyed the book and learned something a lot. Only negative I will say is that the book can be a little redundant."
4,Great stash buster!,"Based on a simple split 9-patch, Karen's designs serve only to whet your appetite for more. The book includes pictures and instructions for 18 projects, plus a literally endless source of inspiration for future quilts. If you have been a conservative quilter, using three fabrics and a background, this is a great way to break into the world of multi-fabric quilts. You will learn to judge your fabrics by their value (light or dark) and it will improve your quiltmaking skills for other kinds of designs, too. This book is completely different from Karen's Optical Illusions for Quilters but every bit as enjoyable."
5,Combing Through Your Scraps,"This book not only stirs the imagination for scrap quilters, but also is refreshingly informative in a way to benefit the beginner and aid the intermediate with helpful technique and designing hints. I highly reccommend this book for the quilter and for those buying gifts for quilters!"
4,CLEVER LITTLE THRILLER,"MURDER BY DESIGN is a clever little thriller to say the least. It's intriguing and well acted; the script has enough twists to become a pretzel of pandemonium! To try and summarize the plot is rather difficult and could result in some spoilers, so I won't risk that. Suffice to say, it's a chilling exercise in murder, deception, greed and lust. There is one big plot mishap however that keeps me from giving it a 5, and that involves the blundered attempt on a young woman resulting in the perpetrator's getting hit with a cellphone. If you watch the film, you may agree that this is somewhat deceptive. But all in all, MURDER BY DESIGN is a breath of fresh air in an overworked genre."
1,NOT GOOD,This is a very low buget movie. Didnt like the storyline or anything about it. Wished i hadnt bought it.
2,The Original was Much Better,"I'm sorry, but the Disney folk are both geniuses and idiots at the same time. First they released ""A Goofy Movie"" a few years back; this was an incredible and hilarious film that many people enjoyed. And based on the success of this first film, they have just released this direct-to-video sequel (a la ""Aladdin: Return of Jafar"" and ""The Lion King II: Simba's Pride""). However, this second installment, while not terrible, is significantly worse than the first one. Now, the Disney folks are geniuses because they banked on the success of the previous one and are hoping that it's success will carry over into this new one. And they are idiots because, had they actually made this second one GOOD, many more people would have paid even bigger bucks to perhaps see a third installment in a few years... unfortunately, Disney does not think that far ahead (Sorry, Mr. Eisner. I love Splash Mountain, though. And the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror)."
2,okay,i simply didnt think anything of this movie.it was hilarious in some parts but the rest was just okay.not too bad for a sequel but i liked the first one better
4,"Not as good as ""A Goofy Movie"" But Entertaining!","As sequels ususually go, they can never outdo the first one. Same goes for ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"". It isn't nearly as great as ""A Goofy Movie"" and I was a bit let down. Never the less, it was still very entertaining, and goofy! Altough, unlike the first one, I couldn't watch this movie more than 5 times."
5,extremely good deal,"i bought this cheaper than i found it in stores! couldn't believe it. this was a much wanted movie from my 7year old son, who is also an X-games freak."
3,Not Your Father's Goofy,"This is my grandson's favorite movie. If your children love skateboarding, ESPN X-Games and good kids triumphing over mean kids, this is a good acquisition. I enjoy watching it with him as well, although this Goofy is a vastly updated (and improved) version of the one I remember as a child. May not be appropriate for the very young."
3,The old days...,"Sure this movie was a great sequel, but it will never overcome A Goofy Movie.Disney is losing It`s old 90`s touch.The movie had no songs,Roxanne isn`t in it,and it`s story isn`t so great. But there is five questions.Will we ever know who Max`s mom is or how she looks like?And why isn`t Pistol or Peg ever shown?Are they just show-made characters or did Peg and Pete split up?Whatever happened to Roxanne?And how come after developing such a strong father-son relationship at the end of A Goofy Movie, Max still acts as if he hates his dad? Who knows maybe we`ll never know or Disney might make another sequel better than the second one as good or better than the first one explaining this.But i`ll never forget the old days where Disney actually made good movies and not terrible sequels like the worst sequel ever made by Disney, Lion King 1/2.Always remember the old days"
5,The Goof is Back!,"This is just as cool as the first one! Although, I do agree with that one customer, they probably should've added Roxanne again. I know it was probably a high school thing. They either didn't want to see each other again, Roxanne moved, or she just went to another college! But even without Roxanne it was really good. It might not be as funny to little kids because some parts are hard to understand, and they don't know a lot about the '70's! The music is cool too. I bought the sountrack too! When I first rented this movie, I thought the berret girl was Roxanne on the back of the case! No. I also thought that there was gonna be more Powerline, because on the commercials they showed the disco parts and I didn't know. After I rented it I just had to get it! As I said before, this is just as good as the first!"
4,Better than many Disney sequels,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. Actually, I expected it to be similar to the bad sequels that Disney usually puts out. Most straight to video sequels tend to have bad animation quality. The quality of animation was good in this ""Goofy"" sequel. I was starting high school with the first ""Goofy"" movie. Coincidence that Max and I started college ""together"". It was really touching to see how such a big event as going to college in life impacts both parents and children. I was glad to see PJ get a girl! The whole coffe house scene was very amusing. lol"
4,"Entertaining, but Disney can do better","I am a Disney fan. Quoting ""Roger Rabbit"", ""Goofy's a genius."" This movie does not disappoint in its quality. On the whole it is a very good movie, but They have done much better. Goofy isn't goofy enough. His son is too cynical, the situations that Goofy gets into could be a bit more fantastic. It's just missing a notch that Disney and Goofy usually give us."
5,Chris Rea Superb,"CHRIS REA - What a great talent, he doesn't scream, doesn't strain, delivers every song, wonderful composer, singer, musician. He should be #1 on the charts for many of his songs. I try to say which is the best but they all are and I am 75 years old and he touches my heart. I have introduced many people to the wonders of this fellow and the comments are unanimous ""Where Is He Performing in th USA"". Most of all he doesn't have an attitude it is obvious that he just loves what he does and he does it so well. Saw him on Letterman few years back doing ""Road To Hell"" now that should be a #1 Hit in these times it is so TRUE. On The Beach transports all of us to days gone by, man woman boy or girl. Superb One of a Kind."
3,Not what I thought,"I assume that this is the first version Chris Rea did of the song On The Beach. Problem is, this version doesn't have the cool guitar lick that the I've heard on the radio. You can hear the hook played by the keyboard but he only hints at this melodic line. Without that guitar line it's just not as cool."
3,Meh,If you come looking for this you probably won't be disappointed. We watched it once and then sold it to my co-worker who was gung-ho about it.
2,2 stars for the movie. 5 stars for the extra features.,The extra features on this disk are well worth the price but the movie itself is full of holes. Too much is left out. Paul Bryant comes out looking like a bad guy here which I'm sure doesn't sit well with many college football fans. The extra features however are excellent. The ESPN presentations of Sports Century and The Real Junction Boys alone make this a worthy addition for any football fan. If you are interested in this story buy the book. It's much more informative and portrays Bryant in a much better and understandable light. Was he mean? Yes! Was he ornery? Always! But you will understand why he became this way at this point in his career.
2,The Party Album Is Great - The Platinum Album Is Garbage,"Que Asco y que monton de basura reunidad en un solo ALBUM que HORROR, Si quieren Algo de Los Vengaboys Compren Su Album The Party Album es Muy Bueno No Es como este que parece Un CD De Musica Infantil."
1,The worst CD I've ever wasted my money on!,"Vengaboys? Hmmm, once they were known as a dance act but Vengaboys have tried to change their image so badly that it now seems a bit of a joke as dance music. I used to like them, I liked ""The Party Album"" and all their singles until the horrid ""Shala Lala"" was released. After that, I should have just given up any hope for the Vengaboys, but stupidly I went and bought this terrible album and now sits permanently on my shelf never played. Ever! ""Kiss"" is a nice song, but the single for it's available and all the other songs are just ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. They're not catchy, they're slow, they're extremely irritating and impossible to dance to. A pity, because Vengaboys originally produced tracks like ""Up & Down"" which were very good and this is totally different. Don't buy this CD, it just isn't worth it!"
3,"You'll like it if u are a fan, otherwise look elsewere",Some of the songs (That Computer Song)are just bad. The rest of them are knda cool but not very original. The balad was a nice surprise. Recomended only to fans. Thanks!
5,Amazing,"This music is incredible, and is the only music that gets me moving. http://www.petitiononline.com/vengaboy/petition.html - help bring the Venga Bus back to town."
3,Not as good as the first.....,"Well, Vengaboys are not the same as the party album. Also the song 48 Hours is from Alice Deejay album. At least sounds like her style. So I don't think is a good album from Vengaboys Style.....Is soft and not SO PARTY STUFF. see ya..."
5,"Quality, not quantity","Anyway, on to the album, it is excellent! You'll either love it totally or not really like it. But I did, and that's all that matters.To give a rundown on the tracks, it has 'Shalalalala' - I song some love and some hate, 'Kiss' one of my favourites, and is quite long, '27/ in my /91 what ever is alright, 'Uncle John From Jamaica is REALLY good esp. the lyrics, 'Skinnydippin' which is good quality, 'Cheekah Bow Bow' (not Cheekah Bow Wow) which is a comedy act, and lots of other ones.The album is has much more quality than it had in the first. However, the first had more tracks. Still...I like this one, esp. this imported version. Get it now!"
5,Vengaboys are GREAT!,"I think the Vengaboys are great. Their new CD is so good. It includes the songs ""Kiss(When The Sun Don't Shine) and ""Shala la la la"". I think everyone who loves to dance should have a copy of this album."
3,Great if you like this sort of thing,"This was a really interesting book, but it was a slow read and it wasn't very exciting to me. It was also very depressing. I did learn a lot from this book. For all you history and/or Civil War/Civil Rights fanatics, this is the book you need to read. For all you fantasy/adventure fans, you might want to read something else."
4,Moving,"This is the story of an incredible, 110 year old black woman, as told to a writer on tape. Jane, born Ticey, was born a slave on a Louisiana plantation and lived through slavery, with all of its cruelties, the Civil War, WW2 and the beginning of the civil rights movement. It's a fascinating glimpse into the lives of people born as slaves with no rights whatsoever, and follows them as they progressed through the following 100 years, learning to assert themselves, gain an education and aiming for better lives for themselves and their children. Some of the language was a little incomprehensible to me as a non American and I couldn't make out the meaning of a lot of phrases that local readers would understand immediately. I'll now try to find the movie on DVD to go with the book."
5,A great look into the changing lives of African-Americans,"This book provided great insight to the hardships that faced African-Americans as they struggled for equality. The story was very believable, but it was a little hard to place it on a timeline. A little slave girl is renamed Jane Brown by a soldier. When she is freed she searches for him. She sets out walking and never makes it out of Louisana. In the end she lives on a plantation until her death."
3,Very Interesting but also very dry.,I sorta enjoyed the novel it was not really one of my favoorites but I was fascinated with the civil war era. The main thing I didnt like about this book was that it focused to much on the part of the united states where she lived Lousiana. But its definatly worth reading.
2,Very droll,"I realize this is classic American literature, or at least modern classic, but I didn't like it. The book isn't really an autobiography; Jane is merely a point of reference (a common element) in a story that depicts the changes in Southern American society from the Civil War to the 1960s. I think it is unlike other slave narratives in that the central character is not the one whose name is in the title. It is a story of characters, many black people, the people Pittman meets. And the antagonist is social construction. Pittman's life seems so very dull, even meaningless. Things happen around her. She is not a participant. Until the end, when she decides to march in Bayonne. In her old ago, she gives her life purpose by finally deciding to actively respond to the terrible things she has experienced. Style reminds me of Zore Neale Hurston --- it's just storytelling, complete with its vagueness, how and what one chooses to remember, digressions. It often becomes droll."
4,This was an excellent book!,"I read this book for my sophomore English class. I truly enjoyed this book because it gave me an insight to the way things were during those times. I thought that Miss Jane was an exceptional character and I really enjoyed following her through the course of the book. The way that Ernest Gaines portrayed each of the characters was appealing to any generation. Being from the South, I especially enjoyed the southern dialect. I recommend this book to anyone. It would make a great book to read for pleasure. I became one and connected with Miss Jane. I suffered when she did and I rejoiced as she did. This book was wonderful!"
4,The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,"This brilliant novel spans the life of a southern black woman from her childhood at the end of slavery to her struggles with civil rights in the early 1960s. In the guise of a tape recorded interview of her life, she guides her community spiritually, after the dramatic passing of a highly intelligent community leader. This compelling novel shows heroism, different races' struglles, love, injustice, and even betrayal, a long with many different races' perspectives."
4,Gaines is a master of suspense,"A friend of mine encouraged me to read Gaines. I was not disappointed, I should say. And ""The Autobiography"" is the first of his novels that I read. Overall, I loved the text though at times you had the feeling that the plot was not moving. Gaines probably exceedingly multiplied the episodes, making the novel a bit unnecessarily long. But I loved the style, very close to orality and storytelling which the book is supposed to be constructed upon as it is narrated by Miss Jane Pittman. Gaines masterfully uses derision, irony and false naivety to create distance. Above all, Gaines is a master of suspense. The climactic scene of the pretended rape bears witness to that: the perplexity as to whether what happened besieges the reader until the narrator sorts everything out. The novel lacks a bit dramatization and ""thickness"" but I strongly advise you to read it."
2,this was the worst book i ever read!,"This book was terrible! One minute someone is teaching about equal rights, and the next minute he is dead! The book doesn't go into any detail about anything important. All the stories are also totally irrelivent to eachother! This book was terrible so i suggest that you don't read it!"
5,"Bilstein BE5-6024, Shocks for toyota sequoia","I replaced my 2002 Sequoia(~140K) OEM front shocks w/ the Bilstein, and I had about 2000 miles total so far, with ~1200 miles in mountain roads and freeways. The new shocks definitely improve the ride smoothness, especially on rough concrete highways. The ovreall ride quality and handling is very close to when the SUV was new. No more bounces and sways. My mechanic also mentioned that the Bilstein shock construction is also much more robust than the OEM shock. Worth every pennies!"
5,"Take carcasone to another level, up","This is a pretty good expansion to have. It can make for lower scoring games but in a good way. It gives the game another dynamic, another danger to look out for or another tool to use against your opponents. This expansion is great, the base game is great and so are most of the other expansions. Dont but the catapult expansion though, it is the worst."
4,fun addition,This was purchased as a gift. I'm sure it will be a terrific additon to a truly fun game for all ages.
5,Fasinating Book!,"I don't Agree with the review below. I found the novel very interesting and well written. Rose was a fasinating character, and the voice that haunted her in her quest for identity captured my imagination throughout the book.Some of the locations used are my favorite places in Europe, so this was a plus for me! The descriptions were marvelous and made my imagination soar and I felt as if I was right there with Rose and Rosamonde.Ms. Stanfill must have done extensive research to blend the historical with the present in such a fasinating way!I could not put the book down because I had to know how Rose would handle each situation. This novel has romance, history, intrigue and drama. What more can you ask for!I do hope that Ms. Stanfill continues to write and delight us with her stories, I think she has a wonderful talent for writing and this reader gives her 5 *****!!!!"
3,"OK, but not the whole story","Despite Richard Adam's classic Watership Down being one of my all time favorites, talking rabbits and I don't normally get along. This cartoon was middle of the road, borderline entertaining, but also needed a follow-up episode to close things up. I believe that it is a slight sin to leave kids hanging on an unfinished story, so I would not recommend buying this by itself."
2,april,"wasn't very christmasy, but it served its purpose and amused my daughter who has ""discovered"" gumby. it arrived quickly, packaged well, i would buy from this seller again"
5,Anticipated Dawn,It is so very refreshing to listen to pure jazz. Anticipanted Dawn gives the heart and spirit a lift which is much needed in this day and time. The artist should be congratulated on his honest approach to spiritual jazz.
4,Inspirational,"Soothing, refreshing and inspiring. Excellent for listening when you want to become in tuned with all that is on another level. A higher level. . ."
3,Not A Repeat Performance For Me,"Although this film had great acting and great production, I found it eerie and troublesome.I will definitely not watch it again. Nothing personal in regards to the film, it just isn't my kind of movie.Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth."
2,Disappointed,"So much critical hype, but overall conventional and contrived. None of the characters are very believable, especially Ben Kingsley's. Jennifer Connelly is, as usual, beautiful but sadly limited as an actress. The story as a whole is dull and predictable. Really felt put off by the director's attempt to manipulate the audience emotionally.Oh, and to the people who've glibly compared this to Shakespearean and Greek tragedies: Which have you actually read, or are we talking only from our knowledge of ""cinematic adaptations"" like ""Troy""?Mediocrity appeals to the masses. That's the only explanation for all the 4- and 5-star ratings given to this glorified soap opera."
1,You will love this film if...,"you enjoy paint-by-numbers acting (and downright lousy acting from Ron Eldard as Lester), ridiculous plots (174,000 dollars is too expensive for a house in Marin with a view--come on!!), an extremely boring and uninspired film score, and offensive Iranian stereotypes.If you don't enjoy watching these kinds of things for 2 hours and six minutes, then avoid this at all costs!"
3,Slow,"Slow, slow, slow (did I say slow). Yes, we ended up fast-forwarding through much of it (catching the speaking and seeing the visuals in fast-forward). It was just too slow. It is a good movie about life adjustments after losing it all, regaining composure, only to be struck down again. Other than that, pass."
4,Good Ben Kingsly movie,Not a real fan of Jennifer Connelly but liked Ben Kingsly very much in the movie.A good film to settle in on the couch with the spouse and share some popcorn.
5,woke me up,"this movie in itself may not be fantastic, but the lessons in it are! this movie has brought forward so many things that my mind has somehow either forgotten or pushed way back to a place that i couldnt get to easily. i fell asleep watching this last night, partly because i was dog tired and partly because i did find it slightly boring. tonight i started it again and im so glad i did. this movie has taught me to never presume, to never judge and to just chill out and have faith. i hope others get the same things ive got from this movie, im very thankful for seeing this movie."
3,"Grasping, but unfortunately.. definitely depressing","I am not one to like depressing or ""heart-breaking"" movies. That is why my opinion of it is less than that of other people who enjoy watching tragedy. The movie held my interest and I thought I might end up liking it. For a while there, it seemed to get more positive spirited (I like to feel good, what can I say). Now the negativity begins. Everything just got worse and then ended. There is obviously more to it than that and I could go into more detail and actually try to give an intelligent critique, but this isn't worth my time. This is a movie review, not a book review. If you like tragedy, misery, hopelessness... then watch this. You'll enjoy it. It is a ""drama"" in every sense of the word. If you like heart warming dramas or happy endings, you will not like this."
3,Watch if for the Acting!,"The acting is superb in this movie! Every actor/actress is really, really good. The best are Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley, of course. The only problem that I have is that the story isn't that good. I know that the author of the book said he read a story of a woman who lost her house and that part is the only believable part of the story to me. I can understand her being upset but once the house is sold her problem shouldn't be with the new owners. Ben Kingsley's character said it best when he told her to sue the county. I agree. Sue the county but don't keep bothering the new owners!! The storyline that her father left her the house just isn't enough to sustain why she keeps bothering these people. And the things her boyfriend/policeman does to help her out is also far fetched. I know it's only a movie, but come on!! Again --- great, great acting, but dumb, dumb story!"
2,home wreckers,"Good performances from Connelly and Kingsley and a potentially interesting premise. But sadly, the whole thing caves in under the weight of ridiculously overwrought plot turns, with far-fetched tragedy piled upon tragedy simply because the heroine didn't bother to read her mail. Didn't read the book (and now have no desire to) but it had to have been better than this arty fiasco."
1,positively pointless!,"A friend lent me this movie just because, and just because is all. This movie dragged and dragged, figured it must be trying to drag onto something,but the end credits rolled and that was all.Jennifer Connelly's character was just annoying. The entire cast gave a dull performance.Acting School is what came to mind.Do your self a favor and rent something else."
2,don't waste the precious 2 hours or so of your life.,"i saw this movie at the theatre, and was sadly disappointed. i love jennifer connely, and the movie started out ok. it seemed interesting enough at first. but then it just drug on... and on... and my god, on some more. by the end of the movie, everyone around me was in tears and i just found myself thinking ""why the hell is everyone crying?"" was this movie a cinematic pleasure, tragic and rewarding all at once? perhaps. but definitely not to me."
1,"Ben Kingsley is awesome, the movie is not","What could have been a great movie turned out to be a nothing movie. Ben Kingsley is excellent and gives 110% in everything he does. Jennifer Connelly was fine too and the other actors did well.The story itself is the problem. A boring story of a girl that is angry over losing her house. You wait and wait and wait for something exciting to happen if not at least something interesting.It doesn't. Not until the end when Ben Kingsley and his wife commit suicide.There, I just saved you some valuable cash. Now you owe me!"
3,TRAGIC ESCALATION OF ERRORS,"An escalation of errors propels the tragically compelling HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG as Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley duke it out over a house. Beautifully acted, directded and photographed, this emotionally draining drama allows us to understand all sides of the conflict. Kingsley and Connelly are mesmerizing and real. Aftwer final fade out, the pain of this story lingers.While watching the film, some wiseacre said, ""Maybe the Hulk will show up and help his girlfriend."" And I immediately thought of Kingsley in his Ghandi role and pictured the passive Ghandi and The Hulk head to head and lost the train of the movie for a few minutes.Interesting commentary from Kingsley but not Connelly."
3,Collision of Cultures,"""House of Sand and Fog"" is a classic Greek tragedy. It begins in order and ends in disorder. If you enjoy charater acting, intense drama, and don't require a happy ending, you may enjoy this film.The brilliant acting carriers the wearisome pathos of this dreary tale. Somewhere in the middle of the story, a small voice echoed in my mind, ""Just shoot me."". Ben Kingsley is a compelling, proud Iranian Colonel caring for his family as best he can in a culture and country foreing to his own. His former life of rank and privelage stands in stark contrast to his current life of menial labor. But playing by the rules in America doesn't always mean justice prevails. For either party.The story ends in disarray. Death, sadness, loose ends, and aching aloneness press upon the heart as the final credits scroll by.For the beauty of the art of drama, the show demands a viewing. But there will be no happy ending here."
3,Waterworks,"Gawd almighty, who dreams this stuff up? Not even if you plonked me in front of a keyboard with twenty grand and a brief to create waterworks could I come up with such an awful story. I cried in the theatre. In fact, I was last out of the theatre. I cried on the bus home, which got some stares but no guardian angel. I cried all the way to the bathroom cabinet where I took an overdose of pills. I died and buried myself. I exhumed myself to cry some more.During the film, a character looks at a Bolshevik propaganda poster. Is the film saying all property is theft? Is that the significance of the last line uttered? Is this a Commie movie? I'll figure it out in the bath. I won't even need to turn the taps on."
1,Ugh!,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Like a Greek tragedy except that there were so many fatal flaws, I was saying Ugh so many times when one after the other were committed. Yes, Ben Kingsley is a great actor, but even his acting couldn't save this piece of utter garbage. The screenplay was written by someone who doesn't know what the word 'art' means. Most of the movies these days are lousy, but this one takes the cake."
4,Great commentary on racism and abuse of power...,"I think the best part of this film is that is details the too frequent abuse of power by the police. Out of all government organizations, there is none more corrupt than those sworn to 'protect and serve'.Overall a very solid film."
3,an interesting movie,this movie was very interesting and it makes you feel bad for the Iranian family who worked hard and di nothing wrong only to have their lives ruined by a woman to depressed to open the male and her crazy cop boyfriend. A lot of people feel sorry for the woman but I can't see how this movie can really allow them to feel bad for her all of her downfalls were due to her actions and she continues to make mistakes not caring who they may hurt. This story does really make you feel bad for the stories true heros the Iranian family
1,I was actually angry I had wasted my time on this,"Why such talented actors would choose to take part in such a dreadful film is beyond me. Characters are only weakly developed and so unrealistically self-centered as to beg the question of how any single human being this irrational could have possibly made it this long in the real world--and yet this film is full of them! By the time the film reaches any sort of climax one is so thoroughly fed up with everyone on screen that it hardly seems worth finishing. As if sensing its own foulness, the film attempts to recapture the audience with a shocking and tragic ending; the impulse is wrong and, worse, transparent. Having not read the book, I don't know if it's fair to put all of the blame on the shoulders of the filmmakers, but this is one movie that should definitely be avoided."
3,Up and Down,"Never have I seen such superb acting and cinematography combined with soch preposterious, sloppy plotting. All the principal actors are excellent; Kingsley is incredible. Unfortunately the story is rife with logical holes, character inconsistencies, situational improbabilities, and legal inaccuracies. What we are left with is acting earning three stars in a base and grotesque melodrama that is worth none."
4,All over the Place,"As was already stated in the 'professional review,' this is the story of how Jennifer Connolly's childhood home was repossesed for tax evasion, purchased by Ben Kingsley and tells the tale of the turmoil that would follow. It's really difficult to pinpoint which characters are the ""good"" and which are the ""bad"" in this film, and that adds to the appeal. Masterful performances are turned in by the entire cast, and from that perspective it is an exceedingly well done movie.However, this one does drag at points, especially the beginning. While the end will tug at the heartstrings, the beginning will lull you to sleep. There is some impressive cinematography, but not worthy of so much time. The dialogue is the strongest point of this movie, and the interplay between Kingsley and Connolly, as well as Kingsley's wife and Connolly, is truly impressive. If you're into dramas, this one is worth a rental. I wouldn't buy this one, though, as I have little desire to see it a second time."
2,Skip it!,Movie was way too long and there was very little plot. Girl loses house due to her inability to open her own mail. Man buys foreclosed house so that he can have some money to support his family. Conflict arise and it takes forever to resolve. Ben Kingsley is a wonderful actor and Jennifer Connelly is a great actress but I would not recommend that you waste your time seeing this movie.
1,House of sand and fog,Could not see the movie ...suspect it was either not recorded or not for USAhaving problems returning the cd as I do not find the original bill
2,House of Mud and Rocks,"Excellent performances, interesting story idea, poorly executed film. A classic example of how a badly conceived screenplay and ""All Eyes on the Oscar"" style directing can destroy a film. What a waste."
2,HOUSE OF DREAD,"Dependent on the unlikely actions of several characters, ""House of Sand and Fog"" is a heavy-handed, utterly earnest excersize in contemporary tragedy. I understand that Jennifer Connely's character is supposed to be an average American whose life history remains obscure but her reason for being involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of a modest home is so unlikely it is rendered shallow. The cop who befriends Connely and slowly becomes psychotic due to a racist mentality is only a device to turn the lame story toward it's melodramatic resolution. It's certainly a watchable movie, even involving, Connely and Ben Kingsly as the compatriot in this legal dispute are excellent, but the platform plot too often sinks in the sand and gets lost in the fog."
3,Perhaps 15 minutes too long,"An very over-rated film is ""house of Sand and Fog"". 90% predictable, and runs for too long. It really didn't need the amount of time given to present the story. Acting was fine, but the story just lacked the spark I was expecting based on the positive reviews.Rent it."
2,Good character development; odd story; horrible ending,"While the characters are believable, the story is not. And the ending is just plain unecessary and ruins the film."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"A friend of mine recommended this movie to me. He told me thismovie was great. Needless to say, I'll never listen to himagain! The first hour was so boring, I almost shut it off. Thesecond half just kept getting more, and more stupid.(SPOILER)There was no need for the boy to get shot and killed, and forthe father to kill himself. With these things added to themovie, it still sucked! THANKS MARC!"
1,Jennifer says: This oughtta get me more jobs!,"One of those supposedly ""deep"" and ""artistic"" movies that play to the critics and get all the buzz about being intellectual and out of the mainstream. A movie any actor would love to be in, any actor who wants to be ""taken seriously,"" and that's the only reason why I think Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley would do a film like this - as advertisement of their skills to others who can make better movies. Because this is a mess of a film, badly written, horribly plotted, and depressing for the sake of being depressing. It's as if the writer didn't have a clue how to end his story, so he just threw in a bunch of dead-end tragic events as a cheap (but seemingly ""deep"") way to wrap these characters up. Depressing stories don't always equal depth. Not to say the film doesn't look good. But you can professionally and slickly package a turd - but it's still a turd."
4,Very nice!,"It was a great movie, and many of the facts about immigrant Iranians were true but I don't know how would it touch a non-Iranian viewer?"
1,Not Impressed,I will be brief.Northern CA. is beautiful and not hard to film and make look good.Jennifer Connelly is an ok actress and plays a horribly irresponsible adult who destroys everything ever given to her.Ben Kingsley....best actor....that's a stretch....I mean Kingsley is a great actor...hands down. He is the only thing worth watching in this movie.The message is horrible....the story is horrible....Why are we as a nation obsessed with the horror stories of life. How about if they just went to the county and discussed the mistake and got it righted and everyone was happy and Connelly learned to open mail.All's well that ends well.this did not start well....it did not end well. i never see much point in perpetuating the horrors of stupid people.Wake up folks.....this is not Oscar worthy. its not even rental worthy unless you like depression.
3,Shakespearean drama over real estate?,"The ending was a bit of an overkill, if you ask me. Like in a Shakespearean tragedy, the stage is covered with corpses. It's hard for me to believe that one real estate error can lead to so much bloodshed. It's not even a great castle. It's just a small one-level house, for Pete's sake!Now, switching gears... I can to a certain extent understand the Iranian immigrant's sentiments towards Americans. I'm an ambitious immigrant myself, and whining American females irritate me to no end. Yes, I can sympathize with the male protagonist. Or is he the antagonist? At any rate, the plot seemed a bit forced."
1,What a bummer,"I watched this movie with my family on Christmas day......what a bummer!! I have never seen such a mishmash of unlikely events put together to form sucha total waste of time. To put things in perspective, I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen; had I been in a theater.....I would have walked out, and I have NEVER thought a movie so bad that I walked out. Shame on Jennifer Connelly and especially Ben Kingsley.......these otherwise fine actors for agreeing to appear in this piece of crap."
1,Absolutely abysmal,"Dreary, depressing, annoying movie. Watch only if you have serious emotional problems and are desperately searching for people with more problems than you have in order to make you feel better about your misearble life."
2,eh...okay,"I have to say this movie was well acted out. As far as the story goes, it didn't get interesting until the last 20 minutes of the film. Gee lets see how many lives this chick can destroy over 500 bucks. Most of the situations in this film are just plain unrealistic. That deputy must have been a real peach on his psycological exam. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,How can this be rated 5*,"Acting good/very good - Ben Kingsley does a great job of keeping you in the film BUT what an appalling, depressing and unlikely tale. The ending was bizarre and painful.This had the makings of something interesting, with plenty of possibilities but at somepoint the writer decided everything must be dark, deep and awful."
5,wonderful,This is a wonderful movie. Yes it is quite sad but it has everything a wonderful movie would need. Characters that are not sterotypical or predictable. Moved at a good pace. Wonderful plot and acting by Sir Ben Kingley! I throughly enjoy this film and I will see it again as soon as possible.
3,The Fog of Fiction,"Ben had a believable Iranian accent, and he sure looks Iranian. That said, I have concern that anyone might absorb his character traits as ""typical"" of Iranian-Americans, in any way. And, as an Iranian, he is not an Arab, to correct one earlier reviewer. Ethnic Iranians are usually Moslem, but they are not Arab.Jennifer was way too beautiful and articulate in the part of the messed-up ""tax delinquent"" - couldn't quite buy into her in that role.And, isn't she entitled to the remaining proceeds from the auction, after taxes and county expenses? Hmm....accurately reporting the mechanism of this type of legal action sure would have changed things in the movie.Even with its flaws, the movie gets people thinking - this is the type of movie that has a way of sticking with you through the next day. The audience was stone silent and sat in their seats afterwards taking in the credits - therefore I give it 3 stars, despite my reservations."
1,A lot of meaningless stuff!,"This movie was disturbing from the first. Not because it had a deep meaning, but because there was so much potential to tell this story and they chose to make stereotypical nonsense the order of the day. A cop that ""saves the damsel"", misuses his authority, gets in trouble for being so stupid and the poor lass that just can't pay the house payment.The cop's actions in this movie had me so frustrated that it made the whole rest of the movie just a collection of unbelievable gibberish. Sad waste of money and talent."
2,This movie was WRITTEN in a fog...,"I give this ramshackle, disjointed movie two stars only because some of the acting was fairly good. But the story line is full of stupid scenes that would never have happened in real life, and it uses violence at the end, in order to try to prove itself.In general I think this kind of over-hyped (and under-written) movie is now all too typical of American movie making, and it's actually very sad. Don't waste your time watching it...'t"
4,Very Sad.,'House of Sand and Fog' is a very sad story. Some of it though seems way over-the-top and unrealistic. Ben Kingsley gives a fanstastic performance that pretty much saves the film.
2,Opening mail can be a good thing,"I had heard countless reccomendations for this movie from reviews I had read online so I decided to pick this up.Let me start by saying I love Dark movies even when they are depressing because I think that if a filmmaker can be successful at affecting you in emotional ways, well, they have succeeded. Unfortunately I think he failed here.Started out great as a character study of people's lives unraveling but after the characters start doing really dumb things just for the sake of moving the storyline along, well, it lost me and the people watching it as well.I had no sympathy for the consequences of the character's irresponsibility and stupidity.It wasnt touching and it wasnt moving, it was an eye roller."
3,OPEN YOUR MAIL!,"This movie was too long for what it portrayed, but it held my attention; good thing Ben was in it. Let me just say, if your spouse leaves you, no matter how depressed you are, open your mail. Life goes on! The owner of the home kept saying you stole my house, but Ben didn't. She didn't pay her taxes/mortgage, the house was taken away, Ben made a bid and won. Things get crazy when the original owner of the home gets hooked up with a hot in the pants cop and everthing really goes down hill. Maybe I didn't understand or missed it, but the movie never really explained why Ben and his family left their homeland of Iran. I really found it interesting that Ben drove a Mercedes, wore suits all the time, but worked on construction sites. When his day was over, he would get cleaned up at a 5 star hotel public restroom. The ending of this movie is very tragic. I wouldn't recommend buying the movie because after you see it, I don't think you would want to get sad again."
5,Home is Where Your Heart Is,"This was a movie that I was not sure I could watch. When it came to the show ,I felt like I had to many feelings about this subject, that I might have to leave the movie. I had seen the previews, but was one of the few who never read the book. I rented the movie, and picked a time when I would not be bothered or feel strange if I found the subject matter to sad. After the first 5 min. I was hooked. I planned on hating this movie ,but for me this movie was like being on a rollercoaster. There were no bad people,just bad mistakes.I was hoping & pulling for both partie's.I had no idea how it would end,and the last 15 min. of the movie touched me so profoundly. Sir Ben's performance with his family at the end was one of the best by any actor in my opinon. The movie is not about a house, but how we all touch each other's live's even when we don't mean to. Extremely touching!"
5,"A depressing creative way to ""check-out"".........","Possible spoiler alert.....This movie offers good drama & excellent performances- Kingsley, Connelly & Shohreh Aghdashloo, but in the end what's the purpose of the film? Many lives are ruined because of Jennifer Connelly being irresponsible! This movie also gives suicidal people bad ideas! The end scene by Kingsley is definitely a creative & clean way to 'check out'. Not like a gun in the mouth or to the head....which would leave a big mess to clean-up....."
2,Irresponsible,"I would not recommend this book to most dog owners. I was immediately turned off by it from the first page:""Most Stafford owners are quick to answer no [to the question 'Is that a Pit Bull?'], and then take the time to say the name of the breed over and over, slowly and carefully, to make sure there is no misunderstanding. They may go on to try to explain what a Pit Bull actually is: 'bigger,' 'longer legs,' 'cropped ears,' 'vicious,' 'trained to fight.'""In my opinion it's terribly irresponsible that she would defend the Stafford whilst demonizing the Pit Bull.Also, pictured on the back cover of the book is an American Staffordshire Bull Terrier, not a Staffordshire Bull Terrier."
3,Guide to owning a staffordshire bull terrier,"a decent book on the breed, but has a reference in it that the pit bull is vicious. to me it seems the author doesnt know to much about the pit bull. statement like that get the bull terrier in more of a bad rap."
4,"""A kid who rats on another kid, is a dead kid!""","If your a lover of all things 70's, film, and 70's film; then this is a must have indeed. Great soundtrack, and amazing use of half shirts. Come on, we have all had the kind of day that the only cure is Cheap Trick cranked with the headphones on."
5,TIMELESS CLASSIC!!!,I remember first seeing a little bit of this movie on HBO and i fell in love with it but i never knew what the title of the movie was so i waited to see if they would show the movie again and they didnt until one day i turned on the tv and the ending credits appeared and it said over the edge but i still wasn't sure what the title was until a few years ago i looked for the title online and there it was.I had been waiting to get a copy of this movie forever so when it finally got released on dvd i was so excited and once i saw it again i loved it even more. This is definitely my fav movie of all time and i would greatly recommended to everyone and i agree that this is the greatest teenage movie ever made and if u dont believe me go and check it out!
3,Reminds Me Of The Neighbourhood I'm Living In Right Now,"This movie is really cool and has a lot of good songs. The area I live in is similar to the one in this film. Kids do drugs, vandalise things, and most of all, call cops pigs.I still can't get over the hilarity of this movie. The kids do things so illegal, that I would only think of.This is one that I agree with."
3,Pizzas! I Ordered No Pizzas!,"This flick is much ado over nothing. I was sixteen when this flick came out and I can tell you it didn't speak for my generation. For sure there was a share of the imbibing of the forbidden juices and chemicals but the vandalism angle is so overstated. Most of the destruction was to the self and not to private property. The makers of the film do make some intelligent observations about alienation between the generations, however, that's all negated by a preposterous ending that's more in place in ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"". The kids are alright and Matt Dillon as the head J.D. shows a glimmer of the charisma that he would later fully develope onscreen. See ""Blackboard Jungle"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" instead."
4,Brings back memories,Good flick; has some flaws (like why exactly is Richie running from the cops?). I remember the soundtrack; I think this movie helped Van Halen get noticed. I love it when you see all the kids with combs in their back pockets: hysterical. I forgot all about that.
5,the best in genre,"Its hard to say about Over the Edge.I liked the begenning and the explosive ending.It has sense of ""dazed and confused""& ""Saturday night Live."" Overall excellent movie."
3,Time capsule,"I grew up in Aurora, Colorado where this movie was filmed! It was pretty much correct in portraying what was going on in the suburbs back then! I was about 12-13 at the time, and The Cars and Cheap Trick ruled that summer -1979! The kids were feathering their hair and going to skate parties. The older kids were messing around w/drinking and pot. Your sisters had Shaun Cassidy and Leif Garrett albums and posters. Matt Dillon epitomizes the snotty, good looking kid that gets away with everything. The popular punk you love to hate!This movie is a time capsule for me, seeing my hometown as it was in 1979, and I'll watch it for that... a rare treat to see things how you really remember them being!"
5,...a real story of teenage rebellion.,"This is the best teenage movie ever made, and you don't have to be from the 70's to appreciate it. Strong performances by unknown,and very convincing young actors, (which include Matt Dillon and Vincent Spano)is what makes this film hold up 21 years later. An awsome soundtrack with the likes of Cheap Trick, The Ramones, and The Cars. Once you see OVER THE EDGE everything else just seems a little lame in comparison. I really hope this comes out on DVD soon."
5,Tells It Like It Is!,"This is a great movie that speaks the truth about teens! Carl was a good, well-rounded kid that never did anything wrong til he meant Ritchie, he started rebelling against the rules and acting like a teen! I relate to this movie because I am a teen that is growing up and it relates to a lot of issues I face! Grand Granada was a ""ideal"" place to live in a eye of a parent but the kid's felt different! THIS MOVIE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS!"
4,It gets the era right....,"I was a little older (but not much) than these kids in 1979 and it's as good a movie as you can find at depicting the era properly. The clothes, hairstyles, music, etc., are all VERY 1979. Fortunately, my circle of friends wasn't quite as extreme as these kids but they also weren't a lot different. Sheesh....how'd I end up in my mid-40s?"
1,This Movie Hoovers,Worst movie I've ever seen. Performances were amateurish and boring. No plot. Dated. Dated. Dated. Who really cares what happens to these cry babies???? You'd do better standing in a corner staring at a wall.
5,This Rocks...,"This is a rockin movie about youth gone wild. As a particular note, this movie was filmed at the Junior High I attended in Evans Colorado. Its fascinating when the kids take control at the end of the movie and let the mean old adults have whats coming to them. I would highly suggest this film to all teens who fantasize about rebellion agains mean grown ups, or if you attended John Evans Junior High School in Colorado, you must purchase this movie and watch it over and over again."
5,A LONG TIME COMING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS FOR THIS CULT CLASSIC ABOUT URBAN YOUTH GONE WILD IN A SMALL PLANNED COMMUNITY CALLED NEW GRANADA.THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEEN REBELLION FILM EVER MADE IF YOU GREW UP IN THE 70,S YOU WILL REFLECT ON THIS GEM.GO OUT RIGHT NOW AND GET THIS YOU WONT BE LET DOWN ITS A CLASSIC."
3,A decent introduction to SQL on the AS/400,"The authors do a good job of teaching beginners how to execute SQL on the AS/400. Unfortunately, there have been many enhancements in SQL on this platform since this book was written, and it is sorely out of date. The book can still be considered a good introduction, but it is insufficient for a reader who wants to be able to take full advantage of the SQL capabilities which have been introduced in OS/400 over the past three years."
3,A Near-Miss CD,"Most folks are familiar with Brave Combo as a modern-day accordion-driven polka-playing band: a cult band. On The Process, they have apparently joined the ""re-engineering"" movement, dropping the accordion and emphasizing their singing as much as their playing. The end result is something like They Might Be Giants, but without TMBG's manic, Pythonesque sense of humor. The net result is one of those CDs that sometimes sounds kind of fun, but at other times sounds kind of stupid. For this kind of music, I prefer TMBG, but still, The Process is kind of fun, even if it is kind of stupid. Sound quality is adequate but no better than that. A near-miss overall."
4,Easy Read,"This is an easy read and is very imformative about a little talked about war. It deals with the peolple of Finland defending their homeland against an aggressive Soviet Union attempting a takeover during the winter of 1939-1940. This study is based on interviews with veterans who held significant posts, research in the official Finnish archives, and examination of the scant Soviet literature on the subject. While the true pictures of most wars are studies in shades of gray, this one is basically a contrast in stark black and white. I won't spoil it by telling you details of the war and how it ends. Let's just say it's worth picking up a copy."
2,The Finnish Soviet War of 1939-40.,"This is a fairly old book written by a Professor in the University of Wisconsin system (where I might add I graduated from). Chew does detail the war very well and some of the writing is interesting. However, the writing is very, very dry and it took much time to plod through this book. I have no problem with the accuracy or detail of the book, but this is dry reading. Since this book was written in the late sixties/early seventies, much material from the Soviet side is also lacking in this book. If the reader is looking for what Finnish or Soviet units fought in what battle or part of the front, this is a great read. For those who just want the details of the war, perhaps Frozen Hell is a better(and more modern) book.This is one of the first books about this war in English so I give credit to the author. Presently, there are better books out there on this war."
2,Very detailed history of Winter War.,"Chew 's book is a very detailed histroy of the WInter War between Finland and Russia. Though not as easy to read as other books on this subject, it provides a good understanding of the circumstances leading up to the outbreak of hostilites and the forces both political and miltary engaged in the conflict. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
5,Tough toy,"My 4 y/o son received this as a Xmas gift. He was so excited to see the package and even more excited to see the spider move on his own. Great toy, easy to program. He will not put this one down. Dropped it a few times off the table, legs pop off and click back on."
4,I want it now!,"From a 7.5 years old - I got this toy today and I love it! In the beginning I didn't know it can walk by itself, and I was really surprised. On each side of the spider there is a launcher and for each one there are 4 missiles. This toy is great if you like Yu-Gi-Oh or collect the big toys. But you need 4 AA batteries, which I think is too much. Now I want to battle with it!"
3,NO FLOOR?!?,"There is no floor eventhough it looks like it... Great value, easy to put together, but I wanted a floor to keep the bugs out as my #1 option. No floor, bugs inside, too much hassle to return!"
5,Great collection,"It is tempting to deduct marks because of these not being digitally restored, but I am so thrilled to have this collection of 39 television episodes (and they were dirt cheap). Until recently I was completely unaware of this 1950's television series. I have since discovered that you can watch them on hulu, but the DVDs provide a commercial-free viewing option, and make a nice addition to my Holmes collection. Ronald Howard, who plays Holmes, is son of the rather more famous actor, Leslie Howard.The television series is on three disks, and as a bonus you get two more disks with four Basil Rathbone movies, three movies staring Arthur Wontner, and one with Reginald Owen. Of course, if you're into Basil Rathbone, there are better collections, including some colorized and even a complete collection of all 14 of his Holmes movies digitally restored."
2,GOOD STORIES -- BAD TRANSFERS,"I love Sherlock Holmes stories and movie adaptations. This collection includes a nice cross section of fine stories, but the transfers are not restored (and probably taken from public domain copies of copies in some cases). However, the low quality, grainy, vintage-looking transfers do give the videos an added element of old England's atmospheric ambience. But it takes another leap of suspended disbelief to fully enjoy them because we are so spoiled with great-looking hi-def discs. Mill Creek should find a way to restore these prints and they'd really have something cool."
1,""" I hate Doug's 1st Movie""",I Am WRITING IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE I AM YELLING! I HATE DOUG'S 1st MOVIE. THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE. IT WAS SO PREDICTABLE AND BORING. SO PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE ON THIS HORRIBlE MOVIE.
5,Go Doug!,"I don't really know why I liked this movie so much, I guess I really liked the show! Its a real cool cartoon and Im glad they made a movie!"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen!,"I can't beleive I wasted my money and brought this movie on video. Doug's 1st Movie is so predictable and boring. The reason why I brought it on video because I like the TV series on NICK. But this movie was horrible. It had a bad plot, it didn't have the same voices from the TV show, and the movie wasn't even that funny. If I were you don't even think about renting or buying this movie stay far away from it!"
2,wilton 7in. angel food cake,"its to small, i thought i was ordering a 9in.. and i really hate sending things back so i`ll give it to some one as a gift and be done with it."
4,canine eye protection,"We purchased these at the same time we purchased the mesh doggle eyewear. This are adorable but, so far, the mesh are the preferred solution for her blindness issue. I think these would be great for a dog to protect its eyes from wind/debris but the mesh ones are preferable for a dog that would try to rub them off. Also, for an 18 lb. bichon the nose piece is a tad long, which pushes the pink lenses out a bit wide for her face."
3,Buyer beware...,At first I thought these where the greatest invention since Legos and Mega blocks but after playing with them I was slightly disappointed. I really would have given it 5 stars if they weren't hallow on the inside. Also you really need to buy at least 2 or 3 sets since you really can't build much of anything with 22 blocks. Then there is the problem with storage.PROS:-Soft yet durable (feels like smooth foam)-Great colors-Light weight and easy to hold-Comes in a clear plastic container. It is a tight squeeze to get them all back in. I would look for something else to store them in if they are going to be used on a daily basis. Most children do no have the patience to put them back in exactly the same way every time.CONS:-They are hollow on the inside so they don't `snap' together like Mega Blocks or Legos.-Each piece must sit directly on top of the same size block or a bigger block otherwise it will tip over.
4,Great new toy,My 18-month old daughter reallly likes these blocks. She builds towers and then delights in tipping them over. She's also been practicing her colors by passing her parents specific blocks. The blocks are light - no worries of injury when they do tip. They also stack easily.
3,These are just OK,"A shipping glitch made these blocks late for my 1-year-old daughter's birthday, but now that we have them, they have become a useful addition to our toy collection. I am a bit disappointed that the Lego-like blocks don't fit together more tightly, and I wish there were more of them in the set. My daughter is a bit young to start building things with them, but she does enjoy playing with the individual blocks and knocking down the structures that Daddy makes for her. But this toy could be improved, by better fitment and more variety."
3,Not Fun For Over One!! Light Weight and Non-Locking,The blocks are made of weak plastic and do not lock togther. I purchased them so my two year old could build a big castle or towers as he does with smaller blocks. These do not lock together so the structure never stays up well. Also the limited tyoes of blocks in the package don't allow you to create anything much.I gave these blocks to a friend who has a one year old. I believe younger children would benefit from them more but even they might become fustrated becuase the blocks don't go together unless you do it perfectly.
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking for a book that would help me upgrade our home security system. This looked like the one. NOT!To say it was superficial would be to give it too much credit. The section on installation was 3 pages long. It's chock full of fluff, nothing is covered in enough depth to be of any use.I was hoping to find out how the pros pulled wires into walls -- what tools they used, what tricks they used, etc. NOT!I was looking for a book that would discuss the features available in various systems and which ones were useful. NOT!Save your money. I sent my book back, but I still had to pay the shipping both ways.I was so disappointed!"
3,The author has written more gripping books.,"The author's similarly-titled book on locksmithing is of exceptional quality. That's what makes this book's average-ness seem so much less adequate. I didn't return the book, but could have found the same information with a few Internet searches.I doubt this book would be of much use to someone learning electronic security, although it would probably make a great resource for a high-school student writing a report for some class or other. Perhaps I'll donate my mostly-unread copy to a local library, where it can be put to good use."
1,Title Should Be Electronic Security Business Plan,"There is far more information (general anyway) about starting a business than about electronic security systems. Many chapters devoted to writing a resume and advertizing. Some generic info on devices and some references to ohms law. A lot of info on picking the right drill but little on picking the right volt meter. Troubleshooting, basically this was about interviewing the ""client"" to determine what the problem is?"
4,Get more Go! Team fix with this EP,"'Are You Ready For More' provides another infectious fix for The Go! Team fans. I have no idea what musical mastermind Ian Parton has been drinking to produce such multicoloured hooks, but this interim release is worth getting just for 'Did You Feel It Too?' and 'We Just Won't Be Defeated'. There's more melody/hooks on this EP than most albums, hearing The Go! Team is such a celebratory experience, almost like a musical rainbow being unleashed. If this is anything like their follow-up CD, I can't wait."
5,Amazing Photos and Illustrations,"This book has an amazing number of illustrations and images. The New Cathedral, The Piccolomini Library, The Sacristy and Baptistery. The Cathedral Museum. The Bell Tower and the Dome of the Cathedral. There's one incredible detail photo where you can see a little door that is topped by a delicate lunette in bas-relief. It was sculpted by Giovanni D'Agostino."
1,Does Not Work,"I have 2 digital cameras, a new Kodak Z612 and a Casio EXILIM about a year old. Neither camera recognizes this card. I tried formatting it and the cameras still do not recognize the card. The 3D website does not even show the card. Tiger Direct will not accept it as a return. 2 lessons : don't buy this card and don't buy anything Amazon sells of Tiger Direct."

5,"A superbly written, illustrated celebration of the wolf.","This coffee table exploration of the wolf explains why we are drawn to the wolf, providing scientific and social analysis which celebrates the wolf in word and image. Wolf is more than just a coffee table set of photos however - plenty of text explains their nature and natural history, making it suitable for library collections as well as coffee tables."
5,Larger Everlast Hand Wraps,"108"" hand wraps (such as the Everlast 4455s) are too short for most people to properly wrap their hands, unless they have very small hands such as some females or juniors. If you have normal or large-size hands or use any wrapping technique that uses a lot of cloth, like one that wraps between each finger, I strongly recommend going with a 180"" wrap such as these. It may seem like a long piece of cloth, but you'll quickly use it up protecting your knuckles and wrist. Remember, don't hit a punching bag or anything else without properly protecting your hands with wraps and gloves. These Everlast wraps are cheap and basic protection."
4,good quality and fit,"I bought these after I bought the shorter, non stretchy ones. These are far better. They have lasted and kept their shape much better, and are much longer so they provide more coverage of the hands. I would highly recommend these. Make sure you hang them up between uses so they can air dry."
1,didnt fit my old UR-40s,and I could have sworn I did the research prior to purchase that they did...would like to find replacement pads for my 40's
3,"Oops, these are for over-the-ear headphones, not earphones","I wanted to get replacement pads for my Sony in-the-ear earphones, but I ordered these Koss cushions by mistake! These Koss cushions are for those over-the-ear headphones, the type you buy for two bucks on a flight. One example is theKoss KSC7 Sportclip/Clip On Headphones in Silver/Black Finish. Because these pads are round, they don't fit over my Panasonic headphones, so I'm now stuck with two packs of useless headphone pads!"
1,Size DOES Matter,"One star because they didn't do ME any good; they might work perfectly well on headphones I don't have.These didn't do me any good because of a problem I've been having with ALL the Amazon earphone pad entries: they don't give the size of the damn things! They were way too small for my headphones (Sony MDR-NC6), but I couldn't find one made especially for my brand, and it didn't do me any good for the entry to list a bunch of other headphone model numbers; it shouldn't take that much research to buy these stupid pads!Obviously, the easiest solution would be to go to a physical store so I could measure my headphones against the pads, but nobody in the state seem to sell the damn things! Anyway, would it be so hard to give the dimensions of the thing on the entry?"
2,Don't fit my phones,"I have never been able to find simple replacement pads for simple headphones that come with CD players or radios. These didn't fit, either- too small. It's a crime that one has to buy a whole new set of phones just because the foam pads have deteriorated. Hope springs eternal..."
2,good for big headphones not earbuds,"not the ones I thought they were. so I sent them back, they look like they could have got the job done but, they were for bigger headphones, not ear buds."
1,Not what I expected...,"Although my complaint is really more with the product presentation on Amazon, I am nonetheless unhappy with my purchase. I did a search for ""ipod earbud covers"" and these came up second on the list. The picture and produce description are decidedly misleading... they *look* like iPod earbud covers, and the description simply says ""Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions"". But having received them, I note that they are for headphones, not iPod earbuds.My recommendation: Don't let the amazon search and the product picture mislead you. These are not iPod earbud replacement covers."
5,They work great,"They work great and added years of life to my terrific Koss headphones. Koss is great - when my headphones broke after years of use, they covered me under the lifetime warranty. I'll definitely buy from them again!Happy listening!"
4,Replacements are a necessity,"You might put off purchasing these to initially same some money. However, if you use your headphones regularly, you might as well purchase these. They do not impede sound, remain resilient, provide a soft secure fit, and are easy to remove and replace."
4,Generic replacements,I bought these to replace the pads on my Sennheiser headphones. The foam density is lower and the texture isn't quite as smooth as the OEM pads. However they work perfectly well and I'll have pads for the next few years!
2,Thin,"Found them to be overly thin and fragile.. Provided very little comfort with the headset, they also do not remain on the headset very well."
3,Sort of OK,"My husband wears out the pads on the earphones he uses at the gym regularly and often. This brand was supposed to fit his earphones: same brand. You have to really stretch the foam to get them on and then it wants to shrink and come off. I found that a very light coating of glue around the edge of the earpiece helps keep the pads on - at least for a while.But what the heck, they are cheap and they work for a while and I couldn't find another brand that looked like it would come close to fitting his earphones. So they are sort of OK."
3,good good good,l love italso made in chinai don't know the quanlity what's differencekoss can be used in px100
5,Physical dimensions of Koss PORTABLE Cushions,"If you're trying to replace foam pads on some other headset with Koss PORTABLE foam cushions, the following is mentioned:The cushion outer shape is a round disk, 1 7/8 inches in diameter and 3/8 inch thick. The opening in one of the disk's flat surfaces, that you stretch over your headset earpiece, is round and 1 1/4 inches in diameter. The space within the cushion that fits the outer diameter of your headset earpiece appears to be 1 5/8 inches diameter. I'd have known this product didn't match my needs if some other review had mentioned these dimensions, so there they are. They are very nice cushions if they're the size you need."
5,Makes Your Headphones Like New Again,"I bought these replacement cushions for my Sennheiser PX100s after I ruined the originals by not using the case it came with when I threw them in my bag and overtime the pads developed holes, became warped, and wouldn't stay on anymore. These cushions fit perfectly fine on my PX100s, and now I'm happy that they are like new again. No more embarrassment of warped cushions falling off your headphones in front of everyone, no more judging!!!"
4,Good Product but not Perfect,"These fit my product luckily - although the diameter between total circumference and the lip of the side which grips, is a little too small in my opinion. The material is fairly tough so it does not tear as easily as some types. The cushion is relatively thin. I would have preferred a slightly thicker softer feel on the ear. Over all I am very pleased with this product."
4,"Good price/quality, fits well to the Koss Headphones",The price is very good as it's eligible for free Super Saver Shipping. I purchased those replacement cushions for my Koss PortaPro headphones. The replacement cushions looked a very little bit smaller than the original ones but they fit. The quality feels like a little inferior then the original ones but not a problem at all.
3,Need more description,"These are decent covers, but no size was mentioned on them. They work for me but I had to shrink them down a bit to fit them on my Sony behind the head earphones. update 4/27/11, by shrink them, I mean I put them on and the pinched the excess together to pull them tight. you can either use something to tie that excess together or on my headphones I will was able to tuck it behind the headband part to hold it tight."
3,KOSS Headset Cushions,"They are inexpensive enough. However, use care when stretching them to fit over the earpiece. The first one I tried tore as I was trying to apply it."
3,Good replacement - but I just needed a pair,"The Original Cushions of my KOSS PortaPro lasted about 10 years. These are excellent replacement, actually same as the originals. I just don't understand why they sell them in sets of six (This is why I rate the 3 and not 5). I just needed a pair for the next 10 years :-)"
4,Replacement cushions,I had bought the Koss headphones for my MP3 player and they were wearing out. I thought that I would have to buy a new headphone set but I found the replacement for my headphones and I am very pleased with them. They were easy to install and fit like the originals.
1,Do not fit KSC-75's,"I bought these to replace worn ear pad's on a pair of Koss KSC-75's. Despite this model being specifically mentioned in the description, these ear pads do not fit properly on this model. Sure, you can stretch it out and have it barely stay on, but the first time you try to wear the headphones, the ear pads will just pop right off. They are completely useless."
2,Disappointing,"These replacement cushions are very thin and very flat. They do not conform to the headset earpieces very well. I have tried gluing them onto the earpiece, but they do not fit. I will keep looking for a better product."
4,Doesn't really fit my sony earphones,"The pads are larger then my earphones to where they just fall right off of them every time, but with some duck tape holden them on, there's no really complains after."
5,Porta pro replacement covers,"They are what they are-replacement covers for a porta pro and they work just fine, which is what i needed."
3,No sizing info and don't stretch.,"Have to agree with the previous review who said that sizing info on these would be useful. FYI, in the package the outside diameter of the pads is 1 7/8"" (1.875"" or appx 48mm) Bought these for my Sony behind-the-head earphones, and discovered that they're too small. I can get them to fit, but it's tough, and requires stretching them, something they just don't want to do. That's disappointing, because the diameter of my headphones is only 2 1/8"" - not much larger.I can get them to cover, but because they're so thin and non-stretchy, they barely hang on, and I often knock one off while removing the headphones. If they were a higher quality material (like Radio Shack used to offer) they would handle it no problem."
5,High qual pads,"These replacement earpads are perfect. They were surprisingly easy to install on my PortaPros, and even improved the sound quality. The old ones must have been dirtier than I thought!"
5,Good to have,I recently bought a pair of Koss headphones and I knew it was important to have extra replacement cushions. Always good to have.
3,Fair warning: NOT for earbuds!,"I seem to have not properly read the description (or lack thereof) for this product, but they came up first during my search for ""foam earbud covers."" Just a fair warning: they are not for earbuds, but in fact for larger over-the-ear headphones... not any fault of the product; I just didn't want others to make the same mistake as me!"
4,Nice rattle box at good price,"This is a nice little rattle box. Have a spectator mark an item or give you something easily identifiable (like a ring). This box makes it easy to vanish that marked object and have it appear somewhere else. The quality of the item is quite good considering the low price. It looks hand made out of solid wood with a decent stain and varnish. My box has malfunctioned a few times (no rattle) and I've had to reset to get it to work. Other than that, I have been extremely happy with it for the price paid."
1,came broken,this item came broken and because its so cheap to begin with i didnt even waste my time ordering a new one
1,useless,"There were no instructions, and the online instructions made no sense. The box does nothing. The top opens and closes. There are no secret compartments in it or anything at all. We have a plastic, cheap version that works much better. Thought this would be an upgrade, but it turned out to be a total waste of money."
1,Dissapointed,"Very disappointed with this product. It was much smaller than I pictured it to be. The ""trick "" is very simplistic and is something that could really be done without a special box."
1,A Dud,"I don't get it. It doesn't do anything. It didn't come with any instructions, and I don't understand how to use the box. It rattles when I press on it, but nothing disappears inside. Where can I get an instruction sheet? I'm frustrated. I wanted my little boy to use it, but I can't even figure it out. What a dud."

2,Disappointed!,"Jane Monheit is my favorite singer, and I love her other albums, but this one is just one boring song after another. Please Jane, go back to the jazz!!"
4,disapointed,"Some of the songs are on other albums,and I was a bit disapointed with that.Over all a very good album with great side people.I believe she is currently America's finest female jazz stylest"
5,absolutely fabulous!,"Picked this up 4 or 5 days ago, so I've had opportunities for repeated listening. My initial impression was great and it actually gets better the more you hear it. Beautifully and carefully crafted. Well chosen and thought out tunes, totally inspired and pro musicianship. Dazzling arrangements and gorgeous, gorgeous singing. Bravo!"
1,bland and vacuous,"This is easy listening muzac, pure and simple - more at home in a dentists surgery or an elevator. The voice is wonderful, but where's the spark and the passion? It feels like the lights are on, but nobodys home. Jazz? No way!"
2,Jane's weakest record so far,"I've been a huge fan of Jane since her first release, and was unfortunately quite disappointed by this album.True, her voice is in wonderful form (when is it not?) but the weakness of this album lies mostly in the arrangements, which seem highly over-produced, sappy, and bland.I get what she was going for here, perhaps a more lush and luxurious sound than the jazz combos of most of her previous recordings. But where as Diana Krall did this sort of thing very successfully with the interesting, haunting arrangements on her ""Look of Love"" CD a few years back, Jane's effort comes across as elevator music to my ears. The paint-by-number orchestrations and syrupy production values don't help, either.I'd like to hear the results if she were paired with more adventuresome arrangers and orchestrators. But ""Surrender"" just doesn't serve Jane's artistry the way it should."
4,"Monheit rarely disappoints in her ""Surrender""","After just seeing Ms Monheit at the Catalina Jazz Bar & Grill just before New Years Eve, I was flabbergasted at how amazing her voice sounds in person versus record plus she has an automatic rapport with her audience. Thus I decided to check this album out and was rarely disappointed except I wish they would've had an english translation of the Brazilian lyrics that Jane sang so beautifully. Also though I prefer the original Brasil '66 version of Sergio Mendes ""So Many Stars"" with Lani Hall, Monheit's version again with Sergio on piano comes a close second. If you're undecided about Jane, do check this one out and I absolutely adore her version of Mancini & Mercer's ""Moon River"" (my favorite track)--from the way she sings this beautiful tune, she must have seen ""Breakfast At Tiffany"" a thousand times!"
4,Jane moonlight,"I first heard Jane's voice on a local light Jazz station and added her to my ""wish list"", then purchased her CD ""Taking a Chance on Love"". As a lover of Samba and Bossa Nova and long time fan of Elise Regina it was a no brainer to follow that one up with ""Surrender"" when I saw that she sang Brazilian style music. I was not dissappointed in the cd, for me there was not a bad track on it. As a long time Sergio Mendez fan ""So Many Stars"" quickly became one of my favorite tracks, I hadn't really appreciated the depth of that song's lyrics until I heard Jane sing it."
4,"Smooth, Pleasing Monheit CD","Jane Monheit is still a young woman, and still an emerging artist. A gifted jazz/Brazilian/pop singer, she seems to be developing her style and persona. Her CD ""Surrender"" should help to introduce her to a larger audiences and further define her direction.Beautiful selections like ""So Many Stars,"" produced by and accompanied by the legendary Sergio Mendes, ""Só Tinha De Ser Com Voc,"" ""Rio De Maio,"" and others prove that she is adept at this sounds and can go far with it.Surrender seems to give a hint of greater things to come for tihs lovely artist."
3,When A Stranger Calls,"I rented this movie & Iwas a little disspointed in the movie!I love the first 15 minutes with Carol Kane,but after the babysitter incident it is like boring for like 30 minutes.But when it gets back to Carol Kane and stuff it's pretty good!I still like it!Rent it before you buy it!"
3,great first act...,"A great beginning - understated and believable, then scary; acts 2 and 3 are let downs. Recommend for first act and strong performances."
5,Classic horror film,"Love this horror film : ""have you checked the children?"" and ""The call is coming from inside the house!"" Great movie."
4,Chilling,"This movie set the bar for thrillers with style, substance and soundtrack. It's too bad the 80s devolved into slasher flicks with more gore than actual horror. More suspense-rich tinglers like When a Stranger Calls would be welcomed by this viewer."
2,some parts were ok...,"The beginning part of the movie is alright and the ending of the movie is fine. The middle is extremely boring. The beginning has Carol Kane as a babysitter receiving strange phone calls. The middle focuses on the caller now loose and running around the city with a bit of memory loss. The ending has the confrontation which was pretty descent. It would have been better if there would have been a bit more cat-mouse chase in it. The PI looking for the caller didn't do much for me...he seemed more awkward than needed. I actually enjoyed the remake much better. Also, aside from some trailers there isn't anything extra on the dvd which is somewhat disappointing."
4,The first 20min is worth it all,If for know other reason the first 20min of this film is worth checking out. If you want tension suspense and pure terror this is it. If your a fan of this type of film or even a film student the begining of this film alone is worth a look.....The rest of the film is slow with no action and kind of falls apart really. I'm not sure how you top the first part of this film with the great mood it sets with it's camera work and music !
1,not very good!,"The only thing that is good about this movie is the first ten minutes and the last ten minutes. The middle is not good it is not scary at all, the first and last ten minutes are scary and that is it. Hope this helps someone"
2,Hang Up!!!,"The most surprising thing about ""When A Stranger Calls"" is the ""R"" rating it was tagged with. I suppose there's a certain intensity here but I would have given it a ""PG"" since ""PG-13"" didn't exist in 1979. To it's credit it's not a slasher flick in the least. It seemed to me that the makers were paying homage to Hitchcock without the Master's sense of suspense. This flick is just predictable and boring and utterly forgettable. What's most criminal is the top shelf actors who somehow felt compelled to appear in this dreary exercise. Even more amazing is this flick spawned a sequel and a remake!!!"
1,NOT SCARRY AT ALL,NO GORE NO SUSPENCE THAT'S ITGET THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE OR THE HILLS HAVE EYES IF YOU WANT TERROR
1,dreadful and boring movie,"The only good part of the movie was when the female protagonist gets a phone call that the killer is inside house which was in the beginning of the movie. The rest was really boring. Don't get me wrong, i don't mind a slow paced movie which were prominent in the 1970's and 1980's but this movie was so dreadful. This movie isn't origianl in terms of the horror subgenre of a slasher/killer calls by phone type of movie. Black Christmas 1974 was the original slasher flick/killer calls by phone type of movie. When a Stranger Calls flat out copied the scene from Black Christmas. In Black Christmas 1974, A sorority sister gets a really creepy and scary calls in the house. The police then trace the call and says that the killer is upstairs in the house. Of course Psycho was the first American modern horror and the 2nd is Black Christmas."
3,If only it had been different,"The main problem with this film is that the most suspenseful scenes are at the beginning and the end. What's in-between is sleep-inducing. After a rousing start, we watch cop Charles Durning pursue the escaped perpetrator of the early film's crimes for most of the film. Also, the finale is quite far-fetched and unbelievable. The makers of this film reportedly claimed that Halloween ripped-off the ""babysitter in peril"" theme before they could put their version on-screen. Halloween is light-years better than this film and it maintains the level of suspense and tension throughout the entire film. All-in-all, this film was too little, too late. Carol Kane, Charles Durning and Colleen Dewhurst all do their very best, but the script fails them all. Maybe they should have taken the opening scenes (which last about 20 minutes and are the very best parts of this film) and stretched them out for the rest of the film?? What a pity."
3,DISAPPOINTING THRILLER....,"After a shattering opening 20 minutes or so, this promising thriller bogs down in the search for a child killer and a boring psychological depiction of the killer's motives. Yes, he's really sick. But aren't they all? Carol Kane is fine as the terrorized baby sitter trying to start a new life years later with children of her own but by then the thrill is gone. Charles Durning turns in another rubber-stamped weary cop turn and Colleen Dewhurst is wasted as a barfly who has a close encounter with the killer. And she has a VERY long walk home that makes you wonder why she didn't just call a cab. British actor Tony Beckham is OK as the killer, but how much sympathy are we supposed to give this guy? Not as much as the film tries to get us to that's for sure. This was followed by a TV sequel years later that's even worse. I can't recommend either one. If you really want to see either---just rent'em."
5,"""stranger"" will not be a stranger to my VCR!","I would just like to stress the greatness of this movie. I would give it a perfect score. This movie has everything a horror movie lover would want: violence,suspense,action,humore and drama. And my favorite part is it has 0 profanity.I dont buy movies unless i'll watch them once a week but this movie was added to the few after the first time I saw it. It reminds you of a blend of HAlloween and Psycho mixed with a little Scream. Dont take my word for it! Watch it yourself!"
5,"GREAT , Suspensful !",This was a very suspenseful film! I love the whole movie but the first half was AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,When a Stranger Calls,"Now before anyone who really loves this movie takes a hissy fit (hehe), let me first say that this isn't a bad thriller. The acting from the cast is excellent, especially from the leads Carol Kane, Collen Dewhurst and Charles Durning. The atmosphere is dark and eerie, making this a thorougly effective and powerful thriller. But I found that the space between the opening ""check the children"" scene all the way to the ending where Carol lies beside...(well I won't spoil it), was completely unnecessary. It was quite dull and boring in this section of the film and would've been better and alot more scary without it. Overall though, a fantastically scary thriller."
4,Great old suspense,"It certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat and jumping. It could happen, makes a parent think."
3,Average,"This movie should have been a television show with 2 episodes. A word of advice for people who are stuck with the dvd and havent watched it. The advice, watch the first 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes. The middle of the movie is shady and rather forgetful. The best scene in the film featured the babysitter,who was also the main actress. Direction is sometimes smooth and sometimes rather random and filler.Worth watching once despite the fact that we live in 2006"
3,A rather different experience!,"After the initial first ten minutes, which are truly terrifying, we are taken forward seven years to see how the killer, after escaping the mental hospital survives on the streets! Only in the last five minutes does the film begin to uphold the horror of the beginning! After watching this film, I was left thinking what kind of audience did the film makers have in mind? A strange film that has to seen to be believed!!!"
4,23 year old thriller that still thrills,"I remember seeing this movie when I was 11 years old and couldn't remember the name of the show. I typed the famous words ""Have you checked the children"" from the movie in the search engine and bingo!! After finding out it was on glorious dvd, I just had to get it. The first 22 minutes of the movie was the most scariest when I was little and has stuck with me to this day. I am not going to go into detail about the movie, but it is great in the beginning, slow moving in the middle, and excellent in the end.I also purchased the sequel with this one and has an excellent ending as well with our two original star characters.Not at all gory, but the other elements like suspense and thrills make up for it. Check out the sequel. Both are a worthy purchases on Amazon!!"
4,When a Stranger Calls,"I read all the reviews of this film, on this site, before actually buying it, so I knew what to expect, and most of the time, when to expect it! As every other reviewer says, the first 20 minutes are exceptional, and the last 20 minutes not too far behind. The problem is the bit in the middle, which provides neither direction, nor suspense. I'm not saying this film should have been full of murder from start to finish, but it lacks that little something that I don't think I've seen anywhere other than Black Christmas which, for me anyway, is the ""daddy"" of all ""he's in the house"" films. This is in my top ten scary movies, and is worth buying for the 40 minutes referred to alone. I just worry that, on those dark winter nights, when I love watching these films so much, the gap between the first and last 20 minutes is so bereft of anything interesting or suspenseful, I may well fall asleep!"
4,Great and comfortable shoes,When I first received the shoes I did not like them. After wearing the shoes a few times I fell in love. The are the most comfortable pair of shoes that I have used in a while. Great price!!
5,Santa Jr,This movie was one of the better Christmas movies I have seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it.
4,Santa Jr.,This is a good story and appropriate for the holiday season. Lauren Holly is not just a pretty face. She adds a lot to her character and is a quality addition to any holiday movie she is in. Warms the heart and keeps the spirit alive.
2,I'd rather poke my eyes out than see this again,"I bought this movie because I love Lauren Holly. But the storyline was so ridiculous and cheesy, it took all I had to sit through the movie till the end. They must have wrote this storyline....like, in a day. I could see it entertaining children. But if you are over 18, pass on this one."
3,"Cute movie, but bad sound quality","This is a cute Christmas movie. It's fresh and original. InSanta Jr., Santa's son is arrested while trying to deliver gifts. It takes some pretty funny twists, including grouchy elves and inept burglars. Overall, it's a pretty fun Christmas movie, one that adults and kids will enjoy.Unfortunately, I had to reduce my rating for the movie because the audio production is horrible. The music often drowns out the dialogue. I could barely hear large parts of the movie. That's too bad, because this movie really had potential."
4,Fun Family Entertainment,This is good fun family entertainment with some fresh ideas for Christmas plots and reason for the season themes to it.
3,kinda boring,"this game is kinda confusing at some parts,mainly stealing bases.if you play it a lot it gets kinda easy.a lot easier than than than tripple play 2000.kinda boring after a while."
3,Updated? What a joke!,"MLB 2001 is easily 4 stars based on gameplay alone. With 2002 I was expecting the same but with the new ballparks added....what a let down!Only the new PNC park in Pittsburg is included. NO Miller Park in Milwaukee and Cinergy Field in Cincinnati has NOT been updated to look like the remodeled park it is today. The game came out a month later than usual but both parks in Milwaukee and Cincinnati have NOT been updated in MLB 2002. Why? Stupidity? Laziness? Probably both.If this doesn't bother you then by all means buy the game, it's still good but for me, a 2002 game should *look* current. I half expected to see Babe Ruth still on the Red Sox roster."
1,Really [bad],"The graphics [are bad], the game is impossible to play, and there's barely anything to do in it. I recomend triple play baseball which is 10 times better..."
3,Maybe they made a typo on the title......,"...or they just copied MLB 2001? I dont know but this is still the best game (for Playstation that is). ANy1 who says this is the best game this year is crazy. Its better than both triple plays (PS and PS2) but nowhere near All-Star Baseball 2002 or High Heat Baseball 2002. The graphics are almost exact as 99, 00, and 01 but the game play is absolutley cool. Anyways if you have Playstation 2 hope that MLB 2003 comes out next year for PS2 (and with the awesome graphics ASB has) or buy ASB or maybe High heat (I reccomend All-Star Baseball). If you have PS and you want a baseball game then buy this 1 cuz its much better than Triple Play. Adios Yall"
3,Blower Resistor,"I received the resistor in good time, but it would not work. I ended up taking it to my mechanic and he told me the resistor was no good, but he did manage to get me a new one. I informed the seller of this problem and have never heard back from them."
4,"""Why Do Grown-Ups Color Me Bad?""","What an appropriate title to get a message accross. I was especially moved by what Mr. JamesDouglas said about using more sympathetic words to describe the word black, since it is a race of people we are talking about. I was touch by chapter five, although sad, the story did get the message accross. By the way, why isn't there a picture of the cover of this book?"
4,"Flashy, orange bike","I purchased this for my wife who loves it. It was simple to put together. Instructions had small print. It was well packaged so that damage in shipping is unlikely. The ride is sturdy. Definitely a great purchase. The details are good as well (e.g., valve stem caps are bullet shaped, handlebar grips are thick and well-shaped)"
4,I'm a Leslie West Fan!,"Somebody else who reviewed this recording mentioned that it would have been nice to hear other than covers. I agree to a point, but I've been a Leslie West fan from before he joined Mountain. Anything he does is just icing on he cake for me. He's been around a while, and this recording proves he's still got it! Highly recommended for lovers of blues or blue rock music."
2,"Another Great Line-Up, but...","all covers. I know it's heresy to speak ill of such a awesome group of guys, but I am not a fan of cover material. Spend a little creative effort on the song-writing side, vice the performance aspect. We need new material from you guys, not more re-hashing of other people's songs. Michael Schenker, Pat Travers, & Frank Marino must have covered every rock/blues song out there. Press forward with original songs, so that in 10-15 years, the next generation can cover them."
2,You guys must be joking,"I have followed Leslie since the Vagrant days, his ups and downs have made him seem so real to me.He has played some of the most powerfully moving solos I have ever heard.That said this album is so below par I almost can't listen to it.The production is so lacking in depth that it is obvious no one played together and each instrument was layered and patched over one another. Bogert and Dunbar are totally miscast They do such a fine job on Schenker's album, and they are patched in here too with much better results. I hope leslie decides to play along with some guys live in the studio, cut the overdubs to a minimum and show the feeling he is best known for. Pass on this one."
3,"Turn Around, Put Your Hands on the Car !","Get your hands off the keyboard if you want a blues CD. If you want a rockin' Leslie West CD, by all means. I for one am tired of every other artist that's either hard rock or pop getting thrown in the blues bin. Nothing at all wrong with this CD other than misrepresenting it as a blues CD. ""I Can't Quit You Babe,?"" forget Willie Dixon, think Led Zeppelin. (Hey, didn't they try to steal that song?) Rock on baby. Others who bought this CD also bought . . . Robin Trower!!!!!!!"
5,Very nice grid....,"I purchased this grid for my non-Blanco sink (whose manufacturer does not offer a grid), which measures 33 x 18 on the interior. This grid is almost a perfect fit, and looks great in the sink."
3,"Nice performance video and demos. The ""tutorials"" are pretty much worthless.","Nice performance video and demos. The ""tutorials"" are pretty much worthless. Don't buy this thinking you're going to learn to play a bunch of tabla rhythms on djembe."
2,Disappointing,"I'm actually kind of surprised by all the positive reviews that Kill Theory has garnered. This was one of the main attractions for me when first checking out this year's After Dark Horrorfest lineup, and the end result is basically a cross between Saw and slasher conventions. A group of college grads (among them horror vet hottie Agnes Bruckner and Sons of Anarchy's Theo Rossi) become the targets of a killer (Kevin Gage) who proceeds to turn them all against each other in an effort to survive until just one is left standing. In between all that is some atrocious acting and average makeup effects, but what saves Kill Theory from being complete horror rubbish are the decent amount of twists towards the end of the film. Those alone make Kill Theory worth a look, but all in all, you're not really missing much here."
2,SAW re-written with college kids trapped in a vacation house.,This movie was clunky and an obvious rip off but it was pretty fun to watch and laugh at. The plot is a little ridiculous and far fetched and riddled with holes. The movie doesn't really elaborate too much on how the killer is aware of the movement of 8 people at all times. The only contact he has with them is through a walkie talkie and I don't believe for a second that every escape route was booby trapped and monitored. The characters could have loaded up supplies and escaped but instead they just stand around yelling at each other or just don't care. The whole thing was really illogical but I guess it's fun if you ever wondered what Saw would have been like if it was made to be just another horror trope flick with a sadistic killer. Just seems like it was made really quick with no real thought put into it.
4,The Guy From Mean Girls!,"Mean Girls, is my All-Time, Favorite Movie, and was pleasntly surprised, when i seen the guy in it, in this movie. It has a good Plot, and Makes sense. unlike Many of the After Dark Films. It Isn't My favorite, Of After Dark HorrorFest 4, the Final, is. But this movie, is very entertaining, and understandable. Would Deffinatally, watch it again."
5,Great for backyard soccer,"This goal is perfect for backyard soccer games. We keep the goal in the garage and out of the weather, and after three years of almost daily use, it still shows little wear."
4,Competiton Steel Football Goal (Size 4' x 6'),"I bought this awhile back and I didn't pay attention to the size of it so I was thinking it was a little bigger than it actually is. This is great for practice and having fun with a few friends in your back garden but is best for children 16 and under in my opinoin which it is meant for I would think...lol. It is easy to put together and with the four stakes that hold it in the ground (that come with it) make it stay in place. The only problem is kicking the ball extremely hard into the net as it rips off the straps that keep the net on the goal. With that said, I've had alot of fun with this and it is great if you like to get the football out and shoot around a little before or after the game on match day. ""Glory Glory Man United..."""
3,"Good, but some flaws in design.","This is good for a youngster, but my 6-year-old hit it so hard, the velcro ties are not sufficient to hold the net in place. This is not for the older soccer player. The stakes also are not deep enough to hold the goal in place as they pop up from the grass we have to hammer or push them down when they comes up. The stakes should be longer and the net should be held down a different way. I will be calling the company for more velcro ties. Two ties were torn before they were put on and I had to resew them. Hopefully the company will send free replacements. Otherwise, okay for price. Others do cost more, but I wonder if they are designed better."
4,Soccer goal,"The product was easy to put together. It is fairly well-made. It is not super heavy duty, and we'll probably want to get sand bags as the anchors are a bit of a joke.. It's pretty good sized and well made for the money. It's still early though so I don't know how long it will last"
2,Coaching Football's 50 Defense,"This book is only usefull to coaches who want the bare fundamentals (stance, alignment, read keys). There is little discussion of alternative alignments, blitz packages, or coverage. If you have ever played or coached the 50 before, this book will not give you any new insight."
1,Bad Quality,This tape is very poor quality. It has static and skips in the recording.There was several in mine.
1,*****VHS TAPE*****,"THIS IS A VHS TAPE, DID NOT NOTICE THAT AS PART OF THE DETAILS.NO LONGER HAVE A VCR SO TAPE IS USELESS TO ME"
5,"Beautiful, soothing, and moving...","What else can I say? There are some passages reminiscent of Bach, but I think Novus Magnificat stands on its own, without the need for comparisons with earlier compositions, unless it is to give a new listener an idea of what it sounds like from examples. Arpeggios abound here, as well as soaring lines that take off like an eagle winging through the space lanes. I cannot, however, compare Ms. Demby's music to the grand moments in Mahler, except for the sheer beauty of it. Mahler's climaxes have a power not even approached here, but why worry about that? Novus Magnificat shimmers with iridescent gorgeousness. It's a feast for the ears. Put it on and let your soul sail through the vastnesses of space and time. I find it soothing without being syrupy and cloying... restful, with glimpses of Heaven. And powerful, without the bombast associated with so many composers."
5,A completely mind blowing and awe inspiring piece of music.,From the very first note that engulfs you from this cd you are wisked away on a magical journey to your inner self. It needs to be played at a good volume to get the full effects of the stunning variance in the range of pitch it throws at you. An ideal tape to meditate with it really opens you up where you need it most. This has got to be the best piece of music I have ever listened to. Thank you to the author for writing or possibly channelling such a wonderful piece.
4,Long hair in a short hair world,"Constance Demby - Novus Magnificat is truly a neo-classical masterpiece. One might think that the New Age classification would deem this just another Yanni type electro-symphonic piece. Novus Magnificat is far too complex and symphonic to be New Age. Constance has employed strings via sampling and structured the composition whereby it sounds as if it were written alongside of the greats such as Beethoven or Bach. This CD will probably be more appealing to the classical music enthusiast than the New Ager. An excellent selection - just not my personal favorite. Obviously, based on the other reviews, I'm the odd man out. Got to give her a high ranking just for the technology she employed back in the 80's to come up with something that remains this fresh and original so many years later."
3,Emphasis on MINI,"This is a good spatula for serving brownies or other small items. It is very high quality cutlery, as the name Rada indicates."
4,The Statler Brothers - Country music's most awarded act!,"This video is a great collection of their work after Jimmy Fortune joined the group. My favorite cut is ""What We Love To Do"", which includes touring and concert footage. The fact that Harold Reid and Don Reid's sons wrote the song makes it more fun..."
5,"Thoroughly satisfying, Irma Vep makes the best use of cinema","This film is a film lover's film. It uses documentary style filmmaking to narate it's slice of life relism, alongside the imaginative and transportative storymaking that gives this film many dimensions to explore, this is the most refreshing and modern foreign film you will see this year."
2,"""Satire"" is such an abused term","20 years from now IRMA VEP's sole raison d'etre will be that it showcased the charm and beauty of Maggie Cheung to the max, which it does admirably well. I can only assume that Cheung was not subject to the kind of befuddling, unprofessional and inefficient conditions of the sets for the movie-within-the-movie, while she was making IRMA VEP. So there is some hope for the French cinema, no? I suppose many American critics would want to watch French filmmakers obtusely navel-gazing on why they cannot make great films any more. (Assuming that they used to make great films, even during the nouvelle vague) Me, I'll take the 12th run of HEROIC TRIO anytime. A work of art? A charming comedy? Mon derriere!Ah and yes, Fox Lorber did the usual slum job with DVD transfer, mucho compression noise, especially in close-ups."
3,Accurately portrays on-going racist attitudes in France,"Although this film VISUALLY captures the pace of artisan film-makers in Paris, it unfortunately is yet another installment in exoticizing Asians as a matter of ""style."" The stunning Maggie Cheung is nothing but eye-candy in this film; yet even with her one-word lines, Cheung manages to carve out her own luminous presence. (Everyone else is like a pale, pasty backdrop). Yet, even that palpable presence is reduced to some *very* ugly racist comments at the end.As someone who has spent considerable time in Paris, this film DOES accurately capture how French people (even so-called ""artisans"" who PERCEIVE themselves to be so ""cultured"") continue to non-chalantly openly ogle / behave towards Asians as the ""other.""What's probably even more depressing is all the American reviewers cited on the videotape cover who hail this film as a ""triumph."" -- Could they STAMP their own condoning attitudes towards racism any louder?"
3,A curious little film,"Honk if you love French cinema. This is the other side of Truffaut's ""Day for Night."" A comedic (and confusing) romp through the world of a washed-up French film director (Jean-Pierre Léaud) who brings in a Chinese action star (a femme fatale in a latex cat-suit played by the real Maggie Cheung playing herself) in a remake of Louis Feuillade's 1915 masterpiece ""Les Vampires."" Cheung tries to maintain her composure as all hell breaks loose around her. She speaks even less French than I do, but is pursued all over Paris by the wardrobe mistress and other loose cannons on the set (no dental prostheses and no spilled blood, though). Eventually, the director goes bonkers, and so did I. The ending is kinda strange, but it's good clean fun up until then!"
4,A great movie for the latex rubber enthusiast,"Irma Vep is a bizarre story about a young Chinese actress who plays the title character in a remake of the 1915 silent French film Les Vampires. It later becomes obvious that Irma (starring Maggie Cheung) accepted the role because of her innermost desires and fetishes. In fact, most of the female roles are portrayed as either bi-sexual or lesbian. Although there is only brief nudity and no sex in this film, it still has a very erotic theme The movie has absolutely no decent ending; typical of French films, but I still recommend this for those with a flair for this fetish."
1,don't be fooled by the cool cover picture...,"This has to be one of the most disappointing movies of the 90's. Sounds like a great concept, the fabulous Maggie Cheung in a French art movie, but no, this is just [wrong]. In general, I enjoy art movies and I do like Maggie Cheung. She is an excellent actress and this movie's saving grace but unfortunately she's not enough to make it worthwhile viewing. The plot drags on to no convincing purpose, with weak and unconvincing characters save for Cheung herself. The final result is totally uninvolving and just tedious. There seems to be an attempt to make some kind of deconstructivist, self-referential movie here, but intellectual goals seem to have overridden any intention to make an enjoyable movie. It certainly doesn't even stand up to comparison with the movies of someone like Wong Kar Wai which are both innovative and poetic."
4,Maggie Cheung is fantastic,"A very sweet, engaging, watchable movie. This is a portrait of what goes on behind the scenes during the making of a lower-budget film. It takes place in Paris. The characters all seem very real. Maggie Cheung herself is simply wonderful."
1,Pseudo-criticism of the moviemaking world,"It seems that director Assayas's lack of skills for storytelling made him try to disguise Irma Vep with some elements of interest (the remake of ""Les Vampires""; casting Maggie Cheung playing herself; trying to show the making of a movie, etc..) just to hide he had nothing to say with this film. There is no progression or development of characters or ideas on this screenplay, contributing only to increase the lose of interest as the film goes by. Everything that is said by different characters criticizing American film industry and French intelectual movies just sounds superficial when the movie you are watching cannot stand on itself because of its own technical and artistical mediocrity."
1,Phooey!,I don't understand all the reviews praising this film. It has nothing to recommend it - lousy script especially. A blah film> BLAH!
1,Pullleeezzzz,"Mediocre entertainment, major navel-gazing , poor DVD package. The only part of this movie that grabbed my attention is when a Gen X French movie critic, hip and au courant, interviews Maggie Cheug in-situ and tells her all about the ""revolting"" habit of the French government to allow and promote financially the productions of boring intellectual movies nobody is interested in paying to see, Arnold Schwartznegger flicks being the favorite diet of this hip pseudo-critic.....Forgive me: this must be the ultimate comical note in the whole movie Irma Vep: for is not French Governement Money that I see behind the production of this painfully unfunny movie about-nothing-and-even-less? Surely, nobody with profit in mind could have contributed to the making of such a dull piece of cinematographic story telling...Only 2 good points in the movie, as far as I am concerned: Maggie Cheung, and... it is only 90 mn long."
5,Champions RUN in the Family,"I thought this book was great! Though my favorite is definatly WONDER'S FIRST RACE, Ashleigh's Wonder turns intoa racing champion,my dream from the 1st TB book. I LOVE racing,I'm gonna be a jockey when I turn 16,like my Aunt. This is THE best book series ever!!! It's VERY sad that Chris sells Sterling,the mare she gave up EVERYTHING for.But Star was worth it. I meanWonder was a champion. I feel bad for Ashleigh,it's not her faultWonder died.""As the roses were draped over Star's withers,he flicked his long tail,looking every inch the champion that hewas. Wonder's Star, the last son there would ever be, of ChampionAshleigh's Wonder...."
4,a decent book,"i really liked this book better than the the last few! but, if i were christina, i would not have sold sterling, i mean i thought she was the dream horse christina always wanted! also, i think christina should have stayed with eventing because i was getting sick of racing. but, other than that it i thought it was a really good book!"
1,Star over Sterling?????????????,"O.K., so maybe Christina has a bond with Star, but she had a bond with Sterling, too. I think she should have had other people help out with Star until he found someone else he loved, (maybe Ashleigh, his dam's owner?). After all, in books 24-33, Christina thought Sterling was the world's best horse and loved her more than anything!! Think of how poor Sterling must have felt, one day a treasured pet, the next totally ignored by Christina,(who she thinks the world of) and sent off to live in a whole new stable where Christina hardly even visits! Get a life, Christina! Horses are such loving, trusting, faithful, forgiving, willing creatures, (I speak from experiance having a horse of my own, Lucky, who I will never part with) so how can you just drop them for another horse after all they've done for you? If I sound angry, I am! I don't think Ashleigh ever did that to Wonder! Christina is SPOILED, I don't care WHAT you say!!"
1,WHY!!!!!!? CHRISTINA USED TO DO -eventing!-!,"This is so stupid. Two books now where beautiful Sterling is gone, Christina suddenly turns away from jumping, and suddenly LOOOOOOOOOVES races. Really. For us jumping-crazy girls, this stinks. Sure, I love flat racing. It's very exciting. But these ""new"" THOROUGHBRED BOOKS GO REALLY DOWNHILL..."
1,use-to-be-reader,"This book was UPSETING!!!!!!!! Afte Mellinie started to like racing i got a little upset but then i checked out this book and i was very upset! I couldn't even read it!!!! I love Eventing I compet in it and i use to share Christinas love for it and she related to my life but now its all fallen apart suddenly shes 15 and has completly forgot about Sterling- the horse she gave up everything for!!!! I'll keep looking at the books hoping for a mericale but but for now I'm dwelling on the old books. -If you like eventing I still recomend #24 A Horse of Her Dreams though thats where she loved eventing and gave up her prized horse just so she could compet in it!!!!!!!!!! Sorry Mrs. Campbell but i'm really up-set, Please go back to eventing!!!!!!!! ..."
4,It was good and bad,"I liked the plot of this book. It was totally exciting. But therest I didn't like. Chris goes behind her parents backs, and once is okay. It was sort of nice seeing her as a rebel instead of goody-two-shoes. But in the next book you'll see she goes behind their backs again! Really. I mean once is enough for the rebel. Also, I hated how she just DROPPED eventing. I was pleased to see it back to racing, but they had racing even when Chris evented. Anyway, I just hated that part. All those years of work, the months working with Sterling, all the practice...GONE. I could kick Chris! That's not realistic at all. I liked the romance with her and Parker though. Parker's a great guy..."
3,It was ok,"This book was ok but I have to admit I liked the other booksmuch better. Once Christina started racing the series stopped gettinggood. i liked the earlier christina jumping books better , Close Call was awesome tho. I think that from books 38-40 it gets boring because they dont really talk about the horse much just about christina and melanie wanting to get more wins to become a ""real"" jockey. I liked the samantha books better. I like Christina should go back to jumping like Parker and that star should be an event horse. Or at least they should focus on the horse again like in the ashleigh, samantha and cindy books. but parts of it were ok."
3,Good book but still............,Now I loved this the series from number 1 but now I don't know what to think since 24 Christina coming in was a shock! Sooooo here what I think .... I loved the racing foundation of this series but when you really think about it Christina should have kept jumping and not sold Sterling. + Star is a great horse no doubt at all but I don't think it would take to long to find him an adittional jockey now would it ? ..... And last but not least where is all the old characters I mean ther was a skip of 12 yrs. between books 23 and 24 Bye P.S. #43 sounds real promising!
2,What Happened?,"The thoroughbred books were good, but recently they have seemed to totally forget what has happened in previous books. I don't think that Christina could be a jockey, in the first couple of books about her they mentioned that she was too tall. They also seem to have forgotten all about her friends.RECOMMENDED BOOKS Pine Hollow, Left Behind California Diaries any Sweet Valley books"
3,It was Ok,"I think that this book was alright but I think that the series has gotten worse. Don't get me wrong, I love the series but the earlier ones where so much better. Also whats happening to the other characters? Where did they all go? I think that they should have a book about Cindy, Samantha, and all the other characters that seemed to have disappeared from the series. It would be interesting to find out whats been going on with them."
1,Whoa!,"What is going on here? Chris and Melanie were twelve for 12 books and now suddenly she'd shot to sixteen in just three books? That's not right. Plus, these books aren't staying consistant, which I suppose is to be expected when you have six people writing the series! Aswell as the books have lost their qualilty. There are so many typos and spelling mistakes, it's becoming a bit tiresome. I mean, really! I'm not spending money on a disjointed, incomplete book with little originality in its plot. Not even if it's about horses. All you authors, take advice from Bonnie Byrant! Her books (All 100 and something of them) follow on and keep that special charm that made me read them in the first place. Pine Hollow and the Saddle Club! Sorry for this, but enough is enough."
2,what's wrong with Christina!,"I have read every book in the TB series. I started out with the raceing books, at the time i really liked jumping (i still do). My first juming book was #24. it was relly good so i read all the other jumping ones. When I finally #38 i couldn't wait to read it because Christina might ride in a race. Little did i know she was giving up jumping! If you really want to read it, check it out at a library. Joanna come back!"
1,blah,Yuck!These books are terrible.They switch from thing to thing.They gets facts mixed up(like I thought Christina was to tall to be a jockey). Christina is a spoiled brat.And the their dropping characters like flies.I think the older thoroughbreds are better written the new ones. Especially the one's about Pride.They're the greatest.The series is ruined.
1,CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY,I am so so mad I finnally found a good horse book that I LOVED and then Christina HAD to start racing. And she had to give up the horse of her DREAM that she was training for almost four hole years How STUPID. Speaking of which what happened to Katie and Cassidy and Dylan and Mona. And how come Parker can just come home and steal christinas heart! (I know i'm bring up old books but please!!!!!!!!!!!!!) PLEASE GO BACK TO EVENTING i will be hoping that MRS CAMBELL changes her CRAZY nut brained Mind
4,This book was NOT that good,In this book Chris is so spoild she thinks she is the only one in the world who can ride Star. And she gets so upset when ever she dus not get what she wants.
1,what happened!,"I can't believe the direction of this series, i mean common! Christina loved sterling now she sells her to become a jockey! ya right! And wonder's star shouldn't even be alive! In #24, wonders last foal was wonder's legacy, Christina's horse, which she traded for sterling! A little common sense here please! I used to love this series but now its all messed up! Please Joanna come back and write! i know your supervising but look at it! its getting pathetic!"
2,I can't stand Christina!,"Christina risked being hurt by Sterling's abusive owner to save Sterling. Then she took a chance and asked her parents if she could exchange Wonder's ""last"" foal for Sterling, because she'd battled hard with a lady who'd already won Sterling. Now she throws Sterling away like a wadded-up tissue? Why? She's such a flimsy character in this book. Nobody ever makes a complete turnaround to something they dislike (in Chris's case, racing). And there's so many useless add-on characters! Parker's the only good one. I'm GLAD Thoroughbred is ending!"
3,what happened,"look I read some of the reviews of the other books and when some of them asked for the books to be steared back toward racing and you did that but she dropped eventing so fast it was unreal and also what happened to Christina and Melanies friends? Like Katie and Cassie and also what happened between Christina and Dylan and Kevin and Melanie one minute they were together and then after the camping trip he was never brought up again and also what happened to Chaser, the colt that sam and ian bought, and what happened to every thing else like Cindy, Princess, Honor, Glory, Champion, Ashleigh's sister Caroline, her brother Rory. I don't mean to be a drag with all of this complaning but I would like to know what happened."
2,Just A Bit Too Stupid,"Possibly entertaining for young children. I just found this too silly, and the production wasn't all that great. After seeing Dumb & Dumber, these movies fall far short. How many times is ""You know what I mean"" funny?"
3,maybe not for everyone,"the book came very quickly in the mail, however the book it's self was just ok. One of the main foods you can have on this diet is rice and sometimes, if you don't have enough will power you can over do it."
2,Sorry It Put Me To Sleep,I am very interested in my health but in this day and age it is so hard to follow this program when you are the spouse and you are cookign for others in your household. I can not give up this 7 days and abandon my family. It was boring and found myself skipping around way too much.
5,Good story for kids.,"Lots of good information for children. My grandkids, 6 and 8 years old, enjoyed it. This was their first introduction to the story, so it answered their questions."
1,Might work for some. Right plate required!,"If your plates curve up at all (read as not totally flat) then these do not work b/c the shell will rest on the plate on both ends of the shell and not be supported by the holder.I've never really had a very difficult time prepping tacos, I just thought these would be a nice presentation. I've never had a worse time putting together a taco. Seriously, it was infuriating and I made such a mess as the tacos toppled over and dumped out several times.It was worth a try for the $3-4 dollars I paid, but don't buy anything expensive or fancy to hold up your taco unless your plates are absolutely flat.PSQuick tip, always heat up taco shells in oven first, prevents them from back along bottom."
5,As relevant today as it was fifty years ago,"Originally published in 1951, The Mechanical Bride: Folklore Of Industrial Man by the influential philosopher and cultural observer Marshall McLuhan is a thoughtful and thought-provoking treatise that seeks to unveil the subtle and sometimes venomous effects of media and modern mass communication. Thoughtful, sometimes philosophical, sometimes prediction with deadpan seriousness, The Mechanical Bride is as relevant today as it was fifty years ago and highly recommended reading for students of Mass Communications and Journalism, Contemporary American Sociology, and Modern Philosophy."
4,Great Stories but a bit too lengthy,"Gierach certainly wrote a commendable book with 'Dances with Trout'. The stories contained are simple and understandable; outdoorsmen can certainly relate to Gierach's feelings and thoughts about his fishing and hunting experiences. The only criticism that I have is that the stories are somewhat lengthy. Not to say that Gierach bores the reader, but unless you've got a good hour and half to sit down and read or are simpy a speed reader, you'll be exasperated 3/4 of the way through one of Gierach recollections."
3,Excellent Resource for the Traveler,"For those planning a trip to Sweden this course includes the bare basics for a vacation or business trip. If you're looking for deep language instruction go for something different. One of the nice things about this course is the nice clear pronunciation. One of the drawbacks is that the language and phrases they teach you are extremely formal, which is just what you want if you are dealing with a new business associate but not perhaps for new casual friends you meet enroute."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a very poor learning tool. You hear lists of phrases, some of them quite complicated, being said in English and repeated in Swedish. It quickly becomes very boring, as the product does not require you to repeat or recall any information. In fact there is no interaction between yourself and the tuition.This pack is useful in that you hear native speakers of the language. I wouldn't recommend it, and I wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Picture Way OFF,Picture is no where close to what it looks like. Picture shows a warm brown and its a very light wood color. It has been sealed so you cannot stain it darker.No good for my intended use.Buyer Beware.Disgruntled in Kansas.
1,useless and flimsy,"This rack is poorly constructed, and only holds very light clothing - that is, the clothing that doesn't slip off."
5,Great Product,I love this blanket. I have given it as a gift in the past. I found it for a great deal by this seller.. Now I have one for me!!!
1,"Smells bad only after 2 weeks, NO REFUND after then",Looks nice but has a big problem.This product had lavender fragrance at first but the fragrance went away after ~2 weeks and it smelled bad.. The bad smell started giving me a headache. Since the smell was strong even the cover couldn't block the smell.But you CANNOT return when you start noticing the bad smell because of their return policy.It smells nice only for two weeks and it smell bad after that!!!!!!!!!! And NO RETURN!!!!!!!!!
3,One of Her Early Best,"I have enjoyed this author's work (under both of her names) for years, Dancing Shadows offering the student of modern Paganism some solid insights as to time lines, traditions, and ""politics"" (of all things); how ""we"" as a race of being, still retain many of the more primal attitudes and innate connections to both, the planet and our ancestors, even in these modern times in which technology seems the rule along side a rationalism coldness that arrogantly denies the existence of anything other than ""man's"" consciousness and mental prowess (science & logic).I would recommend this book to just about anyone both, within the Pagan culture and those standing outside looking in. It is one of those Paganism 101 texts in my opinion."
3,Not all bad!,"Cover Mark does work but and it dries quick, the color I bought was number 6 and it was too light for my legs but hides ally hyperpigmentation spots on my face that I apply after I tone and moisturize. It also last all day on my face so the hyperpigmentation spots never show until I use makeup remover to get I off!! They only have two shades for darker skin to e 6 and 13; 6 is gonna work for most that are about pecan dark for our legs tend to be darker than our face and even other parts of our body! 13 works better for the Carmel to light almond shades they really could create a few more shades to work for African american skin we are all different shades and theses two color mag be bendable but it wont work for most!! I also bought mine from the cover mark site that guaranteed you order!"
1,Do not purchase,"Do not purchase this product if you are african american. First of all, it did not match my skin, secondly it did not dry fast nor was it water proof. I returned the item, but I haven't received a refund or an email from the seller."
2,GI Type Military Repellent,I ordered this repellent to take to Africa. The scent was overpowering. The idea of this toxic substance penetrating my skin and clothing put me off and I never did use it.
5,Fantastic addition to my grill,HEAVY weight and well made. This item has been a fantastic addition to our coleman roadtrip grill. We use it while traveling on the road to festivals all over the country and can not say enough about how much we like it. It truly makes our lives much easier while traveling as we can cook any item we care to with the grill and the accessories we have purchased for it.
5,Item upgraded,"After reading the reviews I waited to wait until the 4 legged version came back in stock, but time ran out so I ordered this one. The Colman box that arrived showed the 3 legged version, but inside was the newer, improved 4 leg version. The grate is built very strong and looks like it will last a long time. With the 3 leg version only one leg was welded to the main cross piece. In the new, 4 leg version two of the legs are welded to the cross piece which should add strength to the grate.I used free shipping and the order still took less than a week to arrive.in all a great experience."
5,I've used this several times now and LOVE it,Burner is VERY sturdy and cleans up great. So far it's the only accessory I've needed besides the grates that came w my grill. Sweet for tailgating.
5,Wow. Love this!,"We camp periodically and like cooking outside. We've carried with us a BBQ pit (non-gas) the last few trips and felt like we were missing something. Our old Coleman camping stove was too small to fit two regular pots.Upgraded to the road trip and purchased these grates! Now we are able to cook outside with enough room to fit a pot and a large skillet. We bought two! I love them so far. Will update this review after several uses. As of now, I am completely satisfied. Was worth it!"
4,What FUN!,I completely enjoyed this book. I discovered Maddy Hunter by accident and am so glad I did. I love the characters in her books and find their antics delightful. I am eagerly waiting for the next installment in this series. Ms. Hunter is becoming one of my favorites.
4,Great Discovery!,"I was searching for something good to read while waiting for my favorite authors' (Elizabeth Peters and Janet Evanovich) new books to come out, when I came across this book by Maddy Hunter. I loved it. Emily is a really fun heroine. The story and characters are great. The descriptions and dialogue of the elderly characters from Iowa are hysterical. Being from the midwest, I truly believe that the author has traveled to Europe with a group of seniors because the characters are so true and believable!"
3,pleasant,It's a quick read but nothing stands out as special about the book overall. Passed an afternoon pleasantly.
2,An average mystery,"The writing style of this novel did not hold my interest. I tried skimming, but I still could not get a quarter of the way through the novel."
1,sjw,"I totally agree with review by sweet sixteen. There were parts of the book that were funny, but for the most part I found it tedious to try to follow the plot with all the silliness. I won't be buying any more by the author."
2,A 2 star book with several 5 star moments,"The 5 star moments are the cast of supporting characters and my most endearing moments are ""the choppy cut"" that ending up adorning several elderly heads and race to get the ""good seats"" in the dining room. It is unfortunate that much of the book was truly just mediocre but for the choppy cut alone I would again plow through the boring bits."
4,good song,this was Lionel Richie's big comeback track back in 1992. it was smooth and complimented his vocal range. it was a good solid track and it was great to hear. I was waiting for Lionel's follow up for some years and this was a good track on his Greatest hits package from 92.
1,"A dull, dreary book","The book is only interesting if you are an avid fan of the Boston Globe, as the subjects are almost exclusively the pols, ""community activists,"" and entertainers idolized by the Globe over the past three decades. Seriously, how could a figure as prominent as Boston Herald columnist/Boston Magazine writer/PM Drive talk host Howie Carr not be included as a influential Bostonian? It couldn't have something to do with the fact that he is a staunch critic of former State Senate President Bill Bulger, a friend of the photographer's brother...could it?"
4,Greetings Fishbone Soldiers,"+AH4-I know you are out there. The question is, how many of you are left and do any of you care anymore? Word is starting to spread that Fishbone is back to their old ways, as in those ""Truth and Soul"" days. Well that isn't exactly the case. But they still have Norwood at bass. Angelo and Dirty Walter are still around too but that is all of the old school boys that remain. Still, ""Nuttwerk"" is a solid effort and even gets back to some of that great old Fishbone soul we used to love. +AH4-+AH4- There is some more ska as well but again it is that of that soul-hybrid kind that has become synonymous with Fishbone. Definitely worth the buy. This album will not disappoint the hardcore Fishbone fan. ""The Reality of my Surroundings"" it is not+AH4-"
1,This Sounds Nothing Like Fishbone: Do Not Waist Your Money,"What happened to Fishbone?!? Unfortunate. This album doesn't deserve to have Fishbone's name attached to it. I was completely insulted by this CD- it sounds like a musak version of Fishbone. There are no hot spots, even moments, on this slick, prettied-up, incarnation of the once mighty Fishbone. What a let down. Just a plain, unimaginative, CD."
4,Brought back the Fishbone in me,"At one point in my life fishbone was just about all i ever listened to...in the past years that has faded, still loving their old stuff though. I was really disapointed with chim chims, but this brings back the good feeling that all the old fishbone albums give me. The metal is gone, the punk rock is still visible at points which is good. Most of the album is funk and ska...much like truth and soul without sounding like 1988. If you love truth and soul you'll love this album."
2,When Problems Arise,"What happened dear Fishbone? And can I call you Fishbone? Kendall. John. Fish. Christopher. Where have you gone? What made you do it? Angelo, Norwood, and freakin' Walter are left, and they're here to bring you mid-tempo reggae, a couple covers, and a handful of guests. I listened to this and truly felt sad. Sad that this was Fishbone. No energy. No catchy chorus'. No fun. And a cameo by Donny Osmond. Good lord! I'm sorry dear Fishbone. You left me behind on this one. ""What you are. I don't know what."""
2,ORANGE OR YELLOW,"FISHBONE, LIKE MANY OTHER FUNK BANDS ARE GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO BUT, A GROUP MENTALLITY AT ALL COSTS LEAVES ME HOLLOW.I DON'T MEAN APERFECTCIRCLE HOLLOW EITHER. I LIKE FUNK AND LOVE JAMES BROWN, BUT ALL FUNK AND NOTHING BUT THE FUNK DOES LEAVE ME HOLLOW. THE TIME WARP ELEMENT IN THIS VERSION DOESN'T HIT A DIRECTION I LIKED ABOUT S.T. IT'S GOOD JUST NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR ANYMORE."
5,Book for school,"I always worry about book prices when a new semester starts, but I was thankful that this book was a bargain!"
5,This is rock!,"I guess this is considered ""rapcore"" or ""numetal"" or ""hardcore"", but to me it's just great hard rock. Project 86 has a nice heavy sound with guitars that have a satisfying crunch. The singer has a unique voice and delivery and rides a middle ground between singing and rapping. To their credit, the band has the restraint and confidence to infuse their songs with a full dyanmic range (volume and tempo) which makes for interesting listening. This record leaves me anxiously anticipating their next offering and, even more, to see them live."
4,WOW!!!!!What a group!!!!,"I absolutely love p.86.They're the best all around band I'v ever heard-the lyrics,the vocals,the music-all are the best!!!The only reason I gave this cd 4 stars is because I didn't like this cd as much as the first,but believe me I don't regret getting this one and I'll get their next as soon as it comes out.I want to stress this:THEY ARE NOT RAP-CORE!!!!THIS IS A HARD-CORE BAND!!!!There is only one song on both of their cd's combined that sound even remotely like rap(six sirens on Project 86 self-titled cd).That's why i like them so much.P.O.D. and their like are okay,but HARDCORE'S WHERE IT'S AT!!!!And they're christian so there's no swearing or any of that garbage,and there's a great message in every song.In a word...AWESOME!!!!!"
5,a very shocking surprise,"This album left me in shock...Im not a christian fan at all...I listen to Slipknot,Slayer,NIN,all the hardcore metal so when i bought this cd just to give this music a try i found it very surprising...this cd has alot of good songs and if you didnt know that this was a christian band you would think it was another hardcore band.I recomend this cd to everyone who wants to try this type of christian metal any other christian stuff that talks all about god in every song is not what i am recomending.Coming from someone is in a heavy metal band an born in a hardcore background i think you should listen to it you will be very surprised..."
5,Projects Best YET!!,A song by song break down on a scale of 1-10:1. Stain's Theme 10/10 A solid starter!2. One-Armed Man (Play On) 10/10 one of the best songs on this cd.3. Me Against Me 10/10 another one of the best songs on this cd!4. PS 9/105. Set Me Up 10/10 BEST SONG ON THIS CD!!6. Chimes 8/10 a decent song7. Toast to My Former Self 10/108. Sad Machines 10/109. Star 9/10 A awesome piano song.10. Chapter 2 10/10 One of my personal favs!11. Open Hand 9/1012. Twenty-Three 9/10An awesome cd get this if your a ture Project 86 fan! Cuz its there best work!
5,Great CD,"I borrowed this CD from a friend, and in the end, did not want to give it back (but I did of course). At first, I didn't think a whole lot about the CD, because I had only heard one song, which one I can't remember. But then I heard the song Chimes, and I loved it. The chorus is addicting to listen to. Another really good track is Sad Machines. It's a mellow track, but the intro sounds that go for like 30 seconds sound really cool. Anyway, I don't have this CD, but if you like loud music, this should be essential (I have it on my computer though, so that counts)."
5,Christian Rap-core's Secret Weapon!,"Project 86 is the coolest most aggressive band that I know. Project 86's sophomore project is a big hit even on the mainstream charts. The song ""One-Armed Man"" went straight to the top of the charts right when the album came out. They are a hard-core band but the have a softer side on them. For example, Star, is a very mellow song compared to what Project 86 is known for. They also have a song that is compared to the styles of Korn an awful lot. That song is, #10. Project 86 brings a style of rap-core that is very different. The way that Andrew raps is a lower type of rap that makes Project 86 unique. If you like EDL, P.O.D., or Blindside, you will love Project 86!"
4,"""So let Your face consume my mind...""","This album is definitely better than the first, and the first was very cool. GGGarth (the album's producer) has done some great things for Christian music; he produced the O.C. Supertones' latest and they just blew UP! He really cleaned up Project's sound as well...not that it needed much cleaning, but ""Lines"" is a lot more refined than their debut. My favorite tracks are ""Set Me Up"" and ""Chapter 2"", although ""PS"" is a definite standout too. If you like rapcore/fusion, this is a definite must."
4,Strong Follow Up,"I didn't buy the first album because of the rap-type influences. This album goes beyond that. My first choice in musical style goes to Stavesacre and Chevelle so it took a minute for Schwab's biting ""street"" vocals to settle in, but after that it became pure ear candy. Dark, heavy grooves delivered with thoughtful, passionate lyrics. The addition of some melodic bgv's really rounded this album out. Makes me want to give the debut album another listen."
5,this is a great cd!,"if you enjoy rap metal or heavy metal, or bands like POD, then you will like this cd. all of the tracks are good, and i enjoy listening to it everytime that i put it in the cd player. this cd rocks!"
5,Suprised,"This cd rocks. Thats all you need to know. Its totally amazing how much better they sound. Take an awsome voice put it with some hard music that is very lightly similar to korn in some areas(i am not endorsing korn in any way) And you have project 86. One of there best songs is set me up and steins theme. Steins theme is about how people are annoyed by chistians but the religion keeps growing,and set me up is about cliques and how people are rejected. But whoever you are GET THIS CD IF YOU LIKE HARD MUSIC!"
5,Cascade 1200 is a great product!,"We put the Cascade 1200 Canister Filter on our 75 gallon tank. We have a red-eared slider turtle and lots of guppies for his consumption. The water was a little bit cloudy at first, but within hours the water was very clear and has remained very clear. Our turtle actually looks like he is floating in the air because the water is so clear!We have had the filter in operation for 2 months now, and we have not had to clean the filter out yet. Turtles are extremely dirty so, we are very pleased with the results from the Cascade. Also, the guppies are very active and are producing many many babies!"
1,Would be good if it wasn't broken,"I have been really looking forward to getting this filter for my 20 gal tank. when i got it today, i noticed the box was a little smashed. not until i was assembling it did i notice the two large cracks in the canister of the filter. Im not happy. this product was described as ""new"" and did look like the box had been opened once before, and its broken. i did not buy a ""broken"" filter, just a new one. it was $90, i want a refund or a new one."
2,Doesnt work,"The filter got dirty quick the water was PEE yellow in TWO days while my tetra 10-30i had pee water in SIX days. overal i would not recomend this. I am sure the 1000 is good, but i rather not try the 700. Used in 18 gallon filled turtle tank with 3 goldfish and two turtles, turtles are very clean so its not them. gonna get a aqua clear 50. 2 stars because i think the larger models would of worked."
4,decent product,it works well. the only issue is to get the initial prime takes a little work! I would definately shut off the supply valve while priming the pump and then open it to get the siphoning effect. Also keep in mind installing this pump will be like installing a new aquariuim thus removing all the necessary bacteria. You may want to purchase a product called quick start after installation.
5,New Aquarium Owner,"I'm new to the aquarium hobby and wanted good filtration with little noise or bulk so I went with a canister filter. It took me about 30 minutes to go through the instructions and set it up. Everything you need to get started is included. I'm impressed with the clarity of my water. I'm still cycling my tank but any issues with clarity have been cleared up after a small water change and some time for the filter to do it's job. It's also whisper quiet. As far as I am concerned, it works as advertised and the price makes this filter a good deal."
4,GREAT FILTER & CUSTOMER SERVICE.,This is a great modestly priced filter. It's very quiet. Not as quiet as my eheim but it's barely noticeable. I suggest buying some bio media to put in like fluval biomax or seachem matrix. Mind didn't come with any but I purchased from another seller. The only real complain is that there is some bypass on the filter as the baskets don't come as close to the canister wall as I'd like but it's good enough. I had a small drip from one of my flow valves and emailed customer service and they shipped me two new ones for free. The leak ended up stopping on its own but it's nice to know their service is great. If this filter had lower amount of bypass closer to that of other filters like it I would rate 5 stars but for around $60 shipped it makes a great filter for the price.
5,Awesome product,"T works like a dream, setup was easy and the directions were easy to follow. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly."
4,"Great Filter, Shipping Issues","I recieved my Cascade 1500 in the mail yesterday. First things I noticed was the unit had some slight surface damage on it. It was cracked on the outside, but this did not impede the seal for the function of the filter. The second issue was the lack of any biological sponge or carbon bag, though these were clearly indicated to be included with the filter. These two issues aside, the filter performs very well and im very happy with the power and the ease of set up/use. I plan on using Penn Plax products in the future."
4,It's ok.,The quality of the shoes and handbags are not on par with those that come with a regular Barbie doll. The shoe display case is cute (and the chair that comes with the set is quite fasionable) but the center shelves are completely unusable -- they are at such a slant that any tiny movement will set the shoes tumbling down. We lay the case flat and put it in the drawer to store Barbie accessories - quite handy but definitely not as designed.
5,"If It Doesn't Go Up, Don't Buy It",Al Thomas has developed an ingenious method for helping individuals to successfully navigate these treacherous financial markets. His newly revised book should be required reading for every investor who is serious about this pursuit.
5,Looking out for us little guys!,"Finally, someone is looking out for us little guys who want to make money. This book is a deal! I have purchased several for family & friends. It's short, easy to understand, and will make you a lot of money. I have been investing myself for just over 2 years now. And, I wish I had stuck with doing everything he tells you to do. I made $7,500 my first month! But, I decided to listen to others about investing in some stocks, and now I've been torpedoed like everyone else in the market. From now on, I will do exactly what he says to do in the book. Also, How many millionaires would bother emailing you each week to tell you about the market, how they are making money, and explaining what the heck is going on? Al Thomas will if you buy his book!"
5,A KISS,"Al's book is a Keep-It-Simple-System for making money in the market. Perfect for weekend investors like me; and maybe you too. There's no chart-tracking technobabble here. No latest & greatest zen-mysticism. No brokerage house hottest hype. ""If it doesn't go up, don't buy it!"" Now that's simple! Buy the book and see for yourself. I did."
5,investing made easy,finally a book that makes investing understandable for the lay person. it enables anyone to take control of their monitary investments with only a small investment of their time
1,Also Disappointed,"While I don't care about the lines showing legal moves, I agree with the other reviewer that this set isn't really usable. I also couldn't tell the colors of the marbles apart, even holding the marbles against a white cloth in bright light. (They are nowhere near as bright in color as the photo of the product would indicate.) I never did identify the purple ones... Also, these marbles are smaller than normal marbles, and the holes on the board are very closely spaced. This makes the set difficult to use without knocking other marbles out of place when playing - which makes it hard for young children, those with limited dexterity, or even those with large fingers to use. I'm returning this set and looking for something better."
2,Nice box,"Thats all what is good about this product is the beautiful box. The marbles are sooooo light I could not tell which color is which, only the red and green can you tell, the others you have to hold up to the light and there is no purple marbles to go on the purple section. So I had to buy new darker marbles. But the box is pretty thats why it says premium wood box. Thats all that was premium. And the directions in the box do not tell you a good enough direction on how to play, so unless you already know how to play, you would have no idea what to do. But it is a fun game."
4,More than just Boeing in this book,"This is a great read for anyone involved in any way with aviation; from the pilots to feds, to managers and engineers. The Boeing Company's history is covered in a way that gives a broad view of nearly the entire history of Aviation."
3,"Dated, But Good","If you love Rodney, you'll at least like this. Recorded live, and probably a while ago. One long track with lots of his ""no respect"" material, then 8 or so tracks of longer (1-5 minute) bits. Some of the longer bits are very funny and you get a good sense of what it was like to see Rodney in person."
1,You won't get much respect if you purchase this.,Save your money. Not worth even $5 dollars. I kept wondering when he was going to get funny. So did the people in the audience.
2,It's not original recordings,"The ""Downtown"" version is not the original, and I found this disappointing. There's an interview on this, and I'd rather something like that were a written enclosure -- who wants to listen to that every time you play the CD, or manually skip the track? Yes it's a good interview, but I was just disappointed."
3,Thought Producing,A required book for a class at Central Michigan University and I read it a year or so ago. So no comments on this but I have yet to find a required book by the college to be poorly presented or boring reading.
2,Disappointed with Phone,"I was disappointed with the phone, because it does not have a display for Caller I.D.; or when making a call it does not display the numbers you are dialing."
4,Work supplies that really work ;-),"Ordered this paper for work. This is just one great example why Amazon Prime is so worth it!! I ran out of this stock, needed it because I was in the middle of a project, ordered it using Prime and wa-lah!!!Wonderful product.Get yourself Amazon Prime. It is so worth it."
4,Great home supplement to physical therapy!,"I tore a tendon a couple months back and have been going through physical therapy since my surgery. I liked the use of the putty in therapy and decided to look online for some to use at home as well. I was very excied to find some here at Amazon.com, and I purchased 1-lb each of red and yellow. The consistencies were a smidge softer than the putties my therapist uses, but they are great for home exercises! The only minor issue I've had is the yellow turns my fingers yellow...it washes right off the hands, but be careful around fabrics. I've had no trouble with the red."
4,Camelot,"Camelot has to be one of the best plays I've ever read. It has such in depth characters and their personality's just pour out of the book. I would definitely suggest to read this book, it was amazing."
2,It has potential,Does no one notice that there is no reason to return to this play for the second act?
5,Wonderful Byzantine Music for Lent,This is a great CD! I have been playing it over and over and have been greatly inspired by it. As a Benedictine monk I have found myself repeating some of the songs from this CD to myself and using it as a source for meditation especially during this time of Lent which East and West are in unity this year with its timing. I just ordered the other two of Fr. Hill's CDs and look forward to listening to them too. Christians of the East and the West will be blessed with this CD.
5,Heavy Duty Cord,Just need to be sure of what kind of plug you have on your generator. I have a 3000 watt Honda and this cord works great for all our needs. After drawing top load through cord for more than 30 minute corn remain cool.
1,cable does not match generator,"This item was bundled by Amazon with my 4400E generator and with a generator cover with 'one click purchase' for all three. The generator is great however uses L14-30 connector and NOT the L5-30 that this cable supplies, so cannot be used together. Also the generator cover is not recommended (see separate review). However Amazon does carry a 40 foot cable with L14-30 connectors for only $99."
2,30 amp?,"Although the cable has a 30 amp male plug, it is only rated for 15 amps. Rather misleading...had I known this I would not have bought it. That said the cable is 10 guage and at 25' the rating seems a bit conservative."
1,Wow.......bad choice,"This cord is a high quality cord but the wrong choice for the generator it was purchased with. I bought the three item set of generator, cover and cord. The generator is good, the cover is cheap and lightweight, the cord doesn't even plug into the generator because the cord cap configuration is not availiable on the generator. Wow, shop carefully. Can't even use this purchase without buying an adpater or replacing the cord cap. Ouch!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CORD FOR BSV 550-W GENERATOR,"The end plug has 3 prongs, and the generator will accept only a 4 prong cord. Why does Amazon advertise this as an accessory? I had to return the cord. Glad I didn't wait for a storm to try it."
1,"Pretty, but too fragile","I really like the way these earrings look, but it took about a half hour to figure out how to put them in and then the wires bent and broke within a couple of days."
4,a zoned out mental institution,"This is the darkest, gloomiest zombie flick I have ever seen. From beginning to end, just totally creepy. It's like a beautiful nightmare. The main character in the movie, Jane Doe, is played by Cheryl Lawson, and I think she does an excellent job of overdramatic, but not bad, acting. Especially when she freaks out or is being hypnotized by the doctor. Not a whole lot of gore, but a lot of really cool looking zombies out for brains. Basically, a hopelessly zoned out woman is stalked by an undead doctor at a mental institution. Very creeped out music. I like this movie. The box for the movie has a zombie on the cover with little light bulbs for his eyes. When you press a button, the eyes start blinking! Over the top movie."
2,Worth a watch but just one.,"I love horror and zombies, but really, I felt like this movie just would not end. I couldn't even pay attention to it over the last 30 minutes. I say it's worth having in your collection, but you're gonna want a couple beers and a big fat bowl to smoke to enjoy it."
3,"dead pit, could have been better....but still worth a watch",Length:: 2:23 MinsTom and Ashley review The Dead Pit
3,"If your looking for scary, this isn't it.....","This was a rather fun bizzar movie dealing in aspects of ESP and a physo doctor that returns from the dead to make his zombie army. Truly bizzar, though my wife and daughter thought it was cheesier than all get out. I felt it was at least deserving of 3 stars."

1,"Holy crap, what a crappy load of CRAP!","I didn't buy this movie from amazon, but by god i've seen it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Trying to incorporate off of the evil doctor creating a race of zombies and the trademark girl with amnesia. Not gory at all!!!! Just pure T crap! If anyone tells you to see this movie, punch him (or her) in the eye."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this album, as Mr. Story has so little variety on it. In fact, he virtually has only three tunes on it, & 2 of those those are nearly indistinguishable from one another! I don't mind a reprise on an album, but when you hear the same tune no less than 4 times, & then ANOTHER tune about the same number of times -- you just have to wonder, ""What GIVES?"" I can't recommend this album, even though I liked the ""Three Feet From The Moon"" cut. Had that been the SOLE version of that tune on the album, I wouldn't want to sell my copy of Abridged. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED. Your choice, now."
2,Two Thumbs Down With Love,"This was like a Mel Brooks film combined with an opera by Wagner, too cliche with no end in sight. Higly satirical, it covered every stereotype of the 60's and added in a sexual inuendo in every possible place. Hugely distateful and beneath the talents of Renee Zellwegar and Ewan McGregor, I have to wonder if they even read the scripts before signing or were just dazzled by the clever wardrobes. If you don't feel like sitting through one-liners and symbolism too obvious to be symbolic, don't buy or rent this movie!"
5,One of my favorite movies,"This movie is so sweet and funny. Renee and Ewan have never looked better and they are hilarious in this movie. If you haven't seen this, grab your significant other, sit down and watch, you'll be glad you did!"
1,Ending was an Ensemblescent Letdown,"Most of this movie was a joy, as others have noted, because of the sets and costumes, and self-aware dialogue, and I had such high hopes for the ending. I'd echo the others who have said that everything after and including the monologue was atrocious and contrived. Perhaps I was the only one who was surprised that they get together in the end. Really, I thought maybe this one would end differently!"
1,What a waste of money,"I haven't seen a film worse than this since ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"". The context was out and the story boring! 20 minutes in and i was bored!Perhaps the only good thing about it was the costumes!"
1,who decided to make this train wreck?,"I have always hated the coy sex comedies of the early sixties -- men ""taking advantage"" of women who had to protect their ""virtue"". Who could possibly have thought a remake would be a good idea? This is no tribute, its a virtual copy of something that was witless and offensive to begin with. I watched this on cable just to see if Renee Zellweger really took part in a movie as bad as this looked, and she did and it was. No update, no twise, just a pastiche of bad movies. Even the clothes were so over the top that poor Renee looked like a child playing dress-up."
1,This Movie Should Have Never Been Made!,"I must confess that I love Renee. Especially in Miss Potter and some other she's done. But this movie is the worst movie I've ever suffered through for ""love"". If I had to do it over, I'd have never even bought the darn thing but I got it on sale thinking Renee could do a good job with anything.Now, I know this was a satire on old 50s and 60s movies with Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, etc.... but even those movies were far better than this slop! Renee.... you were horrible.. EWAN you were worth throwing up for..... gosh! How could this movie ever have been produced is beyond me!Now, if any of you have not gotten my point by now...THIS MOVIE SUCKS SO BAD, EVERY COPY SHOULD BE BURNED AND THE ORIGINALS BOILED IN ACID!!! DID I SAY THIS MOVIE WAS BAD??? THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE!!!"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!,"Last night my mom and I watched Down with Love. All I have to say is that is totally SUCKED! It was one of those weird movies where you were entertained, but you were entertained because it sucked. After we watched the movie my mom's first response was, I want those two hours of my life back."
1,BOOOORRRIIINGGG...and Bad,This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. No other review is needed other than that. Don't waste your $ or two hours on Down with Love.
4,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",rENE zELLWEGGERS CHARACTER WRITES A BEST SELLING BOOK ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO CONCENTRATE ON THEIR CAREER AND HAVE SEX WITH NO STRINGS LIKE MEN DO. A REPORTER (EWAN MCGREGOR) SETS OUT TO INTERVIEW HER AND PROVE HER WORNG AND CATCH ER IN A LIE. DAVID HYDE PEIRCE STEALS THE SHOW AS USUAL. JM
2,I wanted to like it.,"I loved the old 50s movies with Rock Hudson and Doris Day. I used to watch the with my Mom growing up but I never felt the movie was charming enough and the characters were quite annoying.There's nothing wrong with lite mindless movies occasionally but this just didn't really have anything new to say. It was like a Mad TV sketch that went on for too long.I dont know , maybe things are just so different now a days that it is hard to go back and see a movie that really has any significance now in the 21st Century."
3,Colorful,"Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor star in the romantic comedy ""Down With Love"". Zellweger plays a best selling author who doesn't believe in love but begins falling in love with a lady charmer, played by McGregor. Many creative twists and turns occur throughout the movie, although half are predictable. The early 60's theme was wonderfully crafted: the outfits, the hairstyles, and the New York scenery. Although there are some obvious fake-looking designs, it doesn't interrupt the romantic scenes between the lead characters. The plot is unique, making it entertaining for the audience. The two lead actors wonderfully act their characters, giving them the added flavor that the audience won't forget. Besides them, some actors were overreacted, causing annoying interruption to the plot listening. Those who love romantic comedies should watch ""Down With Love"". Though a possibility of mixed reactions, everyone will be entertained."
3,Lover Come Back?,"I'm not sure I would describe this as a ""spot-on riff/goof"" of the Day/Hudson flims. I'm more compelled to describe it as a borderline ""rip-off"" of ""Lover Come Back"" or ""Pillow Talk."" There are too many similarities without any recognition of these classic romantic comedies. The only real homage paid to the Day/Hudson films is a couple cameos of Tony Randall as the ""big boss."" Maybe I'm just a movie snob, but I wish people would realize that these characters are almost identical to characters from the past. Anyway, don't get me wrong, it's a very entertaining movie--not boring at all as many have reported. Definitely worth seeing. If you like it, check out the classics section for ""Pillow Talk"" and ""Lover Come Back."""
1,A Tremendous Disappointment,"I looked forward to this film with such anticipation! I love old movies and prefer them greatly to newer ones. However, this one attracted my attention with the amazing wardrobe and the setting of a 1960's romance. Unfortunately, the story line was ridiculous. The film used every opportunity to be distasteful and provacative. The attempt at humor was lost on me, I am afraid. I will stick with the original romantic comedies. One positive notation: the fashion did not disappoint. The amazing dresses were the real stars."
1,BLASPHEMY!!,"Seriously, all blame has to go to the director. From the moment this film was announced a couple of years ago I was thrilled that someone would attempt to recreate the feel of the glorious 50's CinemaScope productions. Even the opening credits feature the classic 'Scope logo! The opening music credits were spot on. This should be a great time, I thought. Well, THAT JUST WASN'T THE CASE. This is a DISASTER and a SLAP IN THE FACE to anyone who was conned into thinking this would have the charm of the past. I do NOT fault Renee or Ewan. I believe that with a competent director, this really could have been screen magic, but no. Instead, we're treated to a MOCKERY of the genre. The Director's Guild of America should REVOKE Peyton Reed's membership for this travesty."
1,Message to Renee Zellweger,"Renee Zellweger, you are very talented. You must have known this was a bad film. Why did you do it, Renee? Did somebody have pictures? Were they possibly more compromising than this? I find that hard to believe. Listen to me, Renee: I would watch you read the phone book. You would say, ""Bee removal service"" and crinkle your eyes and I would beat my own brains out for sheer joy. But Renee, this is not the phone book. And I think you know that. Why, Renee? WHY? WHY? WHY??!?!"
4,Highly Entertaining Fluff,"Reasons to see this movie: It would be easy for me to type David Hyde Pierce over and over again because, as most of the other reviews have mentioned, he steals every scene he's in. However, there's more to like than him. McGregor and Zellweger are terrific as well and display perfect comic timing in their scenes together. There's definitely no shortage of laughs here.Reasons not to see this movie: Plot twists at the end of the movie are utterly ridiculous - but why get bogged down in something like that in a fluff movie like this.Overall: A fantastic light comedy."
2,Doris Day and Rock were better!,"I was disappointed in the film. They basically cloned the plot of ""Lover Come Back"", with Doris and Rock, and Tony Randall. They changed the details around, Tony, of course, had to play the father instead of the boss, and borrowed some plot lines from other Doris Day films, but the story is basically the same. Renee is miscast--she seems to have only two facial expressions, wooden, and P.O.ed. There seems to be little chemistry between Renee and Ewan. It was nice to see the sets, clothes, and graphics, but it's all been done in other movies, the apartment with gadgets, for example. And realize how far women have come (we used to make coffee for everyone). The twist at the end was ridiculous, so was the ending. Get one of the Doris Day movies instead!"
2,entirely forgettable,"This piece of fluff was so forgettable that my wife and I were about half an hour into it before we realized we'd actually seen it before.I'm giving it two stars because there were a couple of moments of witty, well-written dialogue, because the retro-early sixties fashions were mildly amusing and because David Hyde Pierce gives a funny performance. I also liked the faux-Gershwin music.Apart from that, not much to object to or admire either. The leads don't have much chemistry and McGregor especially seems very out of his element like a callow, immature version of Sean Connery.This is apparently an ""omage"" to the Rock Hudson-Doris Day movies of the early sixties. Those weren't much good either so it's not surprising that this attempt to reproduce them also fails to make much of an impression."
2,Down with this MOVIE!!!,"Just a horrible, horrible film. The film is a spoof on 60's Doris Day/Rock Hudson formula romantic comedies, but rather than being a tribute to the genre, this film butchers it. Renee Zellweger does what she can with the script, as do a very talented supporting cast, but what the script writers didn't cripple, Ewan McGregor finishes off with a poor performance. Most of the comedy is either crude or simply hackneyed - the split-screen implied sexual acts is the culminating dagger in the heart. The Wife and I agreed - one of the worst films we've seen in awhile. No wonder you never heard about this thing..."
3,It could have been better,"I loved almost everything about this movie. I loved the look of the movie, the actors, the acting, the music and even the plot. But I think it was too long and the script wasn't funny enough. I was kinda bored by the end."
5,"""Here's to love!""","Down With Love is one of my favorite films. It's witty, hilarious, shameless and delightful! The dialogue is almost painfully clever in some parts, but Ewan and Renee manage to carry it off with aplomb. As just about every single other review has said, the lavish costuming and sets deserve full praise, and as some of the reviews have said, the movie really is phenomenal. If you dislike puns, wordplay, saturated colors, situational humor or kitchik endings, by all means--pass on the film. If any or all of the above appeal to you? Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Down With Love."
2,Makes You Miss Rock and Doris,"On the plus side: The costumes and decor are just the right side of kitsch; it will make fans of the singer on the soundtrack, Michael Buble'; and David Hyde-Pierce shows why he's this generation's Tony Randall (and you can easily compare, since Tony has a cameo).Not so good: The writers couldn't decide if they were doing a remake or a send-up; not surprisingly, what used to pass as sly sexual innuendo is now simply vulgar; worst of all, the stars aren't up to the originals. Rene'e doesn't have anything like Bridget Jones to chew on here, and Ewen reminds us that Rock Hudson -- if he was no Cary Grant -- at least had the humorous heft to make this sort of thing credible and fun. Too bad. It was a bright idea."
5,"The fastest, most fun 90 minutes I've had in a long time","/Down With Love/ is, without doubt, a very silly movie. But it's fun, it moves at a good clip, and it is filled with cool characters. Renee is cute and stylish, Ewan's got his pseudo-suave demeanor, and David Hyde Pierce offers up an excellent supporting character (Niles as a beatnik? It's worth seeing the movie just for that). The genuinely surprising twist in the story combined with a number of 60s clichés makes for a really enjoyable experience overall. Oh and the music is very well done too, in my opinion.I think this movie was unfairly passed over in the theaters, which is a shame. It's a blast to watch, and it's really well done. /Down With Love/ is the most fun I've had in 90 minutes in a long time, and definitely one of the more well crafted movies of the last few years."
3,Art Direction Seared My Eyeballs,"This is certainly an earnest homage to Late Fifties-Early Sixties battle of the sexes flicks particularly the Rock and Doris romps. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor make for attractive leads and David Hyde-Pierce is simply stupendous in the Tony Randall part(Randall does a cameo here). There's a certain wit to the script and some clever double entendres present that wouldn't have been allowed in the earlier films. I can't give the flick the pass because the art direction-costume design is the height of garishness. Now I wasn't born until '63 but I've seen enough films from the era to state that the film's vomit inducing look is an act of self-indulgence. Maybe somebody should have seen an episode of ""Madmen"" to see how it's done right."
4,Where's the preview?,"I loved this movie and, as a movie, would give it five stars. But I was disappointed that the DVD did not include what is usually a standard special feature, the stylish and amusing trailer for the film, which I had been looking forward to seeing again."
1,No one should be forced to sit through this.,"I understand that this is supposed to be a satire, but even a successful satire should be entertaining. The only thing this movie succeeds in being is a World Class BORE!Renee Zellweger was cute enough in a part devoid of any character, but Ewan McGregor falls way short of the standards set by leading men like James Garner, Rock Hudson, and Rod Taylor. Instead of watching this movie, spend a night mastering your Epi-lady instead. I promise you you'll have more fun."
3,60's romantic comedy with a 21st century polish.,"Down with love takes a script that spoofs the romantic comedies from the 50's and 60's and adds a 21st century flair. Renee and Ewan did a fine job, the sets and costumes were groovy and the 60's cool/spy jazz soundtrack was great. The film does use a lot of sexual innuendo, which I happened to enjoy, but may not be for everyone. I thought the twists at the end were a little too drawn out (and over-explained). The film also lacked something I couldn't quite put my finger on ... after a few days I still haven't figured out what could have put in on par with those Hepburn/Peck and Day/Hudson films ... maybe just the fact that it's not an old film and the dialogue is more on the witty than it is charming."
4,I liked it,"It's pretty much your typical romantic comedy, but depending on your movie taste, you might enjoy that. In the credits, Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor sing a song together. The video for the song is included in the DVD. It's one of my favorite parts of the movie. The movie has some dirty parts, and they're hilarious. Overall, it's a really cute movie."
5,cute movie,i really loved this movie because it did not have any bad lanugue in it and the plot was funny
1,ROCK AND DORIS REDUX,"Like Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies? Then skip this pointless 60's clone and watch the real thing. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor's embarrassment is palpable in this pretentious, self-conscious dud.You have been warned.The director's comentary is an excrutiating exercise in self-aggrandizement. The guy does not have a clue about what makes a movie work and what is commercial. This is an arty, private indulgence that is as unfortunately ill-conceived as the shot for shot remake of ""Psycho."""
1,Unwatchable,"Maybe this movie is supposed to be campy, and fluffy, and cheesy. And it is, but it is also terrible. It was completelyand totally unwatchable. I turned it off after a half an hour.Don't waste your time and money."
1,Don't bother,"I had high hopes for the movie, I looked at all the reviews on Amazon's website...so I when I found it on sale at a local store I bought it. I watched the whole movie...to be brutally honest this had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen (one my worst movies list, it is now #1). Don't bother buying it...if you really MUST see this movie rent it."
2,Cute but unmemorable,"DOWN WITH LOVE has its moments, and hopefully David Hyde Pierce will not remain one of Hollywood's most underrated actors for much longer, but it left me wondering exactly what its point was. Much like FAR FROM HEAVEN, I kept waiting for the moment where this film would make its clever connection with/commentary on the present, but all I got were expertly-constructed retro sets and costume design. Maybe I'm being unfair in looking for something that the creators possibly never intended, or maybe the whole point of the film flew over my head, but with most of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson catalogue currently available on DVD, this movie feels unnecessary."
3,DOWN WITH LOVE {WIDESCREEN EDITION},"The movie for me was so-so. But I am an older guy & this ""Battle of the Sexes"" doesn't interest me too much. But it was still an O.K. movie, it has Renee Zellweger in it. Man is she nice !!!! Her smile lights up the screen, & she is a pretty darn good actress too. The color, picture quality & sound were all pretty good. Didn't have a problem with any of them. It's also in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio, my favorite. Here are the special features you get : Audio Commentary: 8 Production Vignettes: Deleted Scenes: HBO Special: Gag Reel & a Music Video with Renee & Ewan. I never saw this before buying the dvd & only bought it because of Renee, & I got it for a low price too."
3,Silly fun,"A fun parody of the 50's romantic comedies.Its the modern version of ""Sex and the Single girl"" which had Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood, although they claim its a take off on Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Ewan and Renee are delightful in it."
4,"Easier setup than I thought, solid construction","I was not looking forward to putting this together for the kids (9 & 6), but set up was actually pretty easy.I bought some extra ties to secure the net as I just can't see the velcro attachments lasting too long, but so far so good.The product exceeded my expectations and is great for the backyard. Both of my boys are travel caliber and I have no worries of the ball going through the net on hard kicks.Good bang for the buck - if you're on the fence and you're buying for 16 & under crowd, it's a no brainer."
3,bends easily,The price is rights but... a couple of soccer kicks on the crossbars and it bends easily. You must take the cross bar apart and try to bend it yourself.
3,A Story About a Femme Fatale!,"This book about Anet Beck is more along the lines of a tragedy based on romance. It deals with a young femme fatale - Annet Beck who has all the neighbourhood boys after her. She keeps her own council, and does not open up to anyone, but when she is embroiled in a tragic death resulting from a jewellery store robbery, it is found out by George Felse that there are more than just the young boys and men that are after her, and it appears that she is returning the attention of one of her admirerers, and this admirer is one that is probably considerably older than her. A bit melodramatic perhaps, but written in the Ellis Peter style, so definitely a readable book - but not a mystery as we have come to expect from Ms. Peters."
2,Meh.... Erotic? Ummmm... where?,"Save your money, seriously. Most of these stories are mediocre at best. Some are written so horridly, I can't believe they actually got into a book titled ""The Best"". You'll find better erotica on AFF. net or Mediaminer (dig around, good fic exists). For free.More than half of these little tales, are angsty and depressing. Which is fine, if you're doing a ""Best of Womens Angst"" book. Erotica? Where??? Just because theres a minimum of one sex scene in each story, does not make it erotic. There's no seduction to the reader, no introspection, and hell, not even the smut scenes are that hot.I was incredibly disappointed with this book, I do not recommend it at all."
1,disappointing,"For me, nothing's worse than ending a story feeling down and depressed, and at least 80% of the stories had that effect on me. Oh, yes, they used all of the ""words"" you expect in erotic writing, but oddly enough that's all they were...just words without a real feeling of heat or arousal. I actually tore the book up and threw it away."
1,pains me to write this,"i love to read erotica. and i've enjoyed other collections edited by marcy sheiner. but this book is such a disappointment. the stories are mostly fine stories. but i don't buy collections of erotica for ""a"" story. usually women's erotica offers stories that are exciting from psychological, intellectual, and sexual angles. sadly, most of the stories in this book have none of these qualities to offer."
3,"An accessible, unremarkable monograph","""The Language of Leadership"" is a fairly quick and easy read. Soder seasons his account w/ many illustrative anecdotes from classical literary sources. He is very well-read, of course, so his excerpts are aptly chosen. Yet I often found myself skimming ahead through his text in search of ""more matter, less art"" (to invoke the Bard of Avon!).Readers seeking more substance on this score would do better to consult another Jossey-Bass title instead: ""The Art of Framing: Managing the Language of Leadership"" (by Fairhurst & Sarr, 1996). Otherwise, Soder's book has a few new and suggestive insights to offer. Granted, it may be fine--at least as far as it goes. It just doesn't go very far or break much original ground on the subject."
4,Interesting,This book is very interesting. It definitely was not what I expected it to be but I found the story to be so entrancing that I couldn't put the book down until I was completely done reading it!
2,A terrible chore to read,"I had to read this book for one of my college history classes and it was just a really tedious process. Even though the book is really short, it took me about 3 days to read it. This book is not a novel. It is not a fictional story. It is a true story that discusses the validity of Giovanni and Lusanna's so called marriage. The entire book is about Lusanna's story, then Giovanni's story. Naturally, each other's statements contradict each other. This whole book is like reading a legal transcript from a court house. The author himself, writes as if he were a witness in the court house as this whole case is broiling. This book is not one bit interesting and as soon as I am finished with my term paper, I'm running back to the book store to return it and getting my money back."

4,McDonalds Mania,"This toy is so much fun!! Having a Barbie McDonalds PLayset in your home is so much fun for your children, simply because your children have the experience of being and going through a McDonalds drive-through. Knowing the fact your children can have so much fun at such a great price is what I call a great deal!!"
4,The truth of the Divine Romance...,"Despite not being a fan of ""allegorical "" or ""fictional"" storytelling based on biblical truths, I found this book a valiant attempt to put into words a marvelous truth in the Bible. God wants to get married! While I find many readers tend to get stuck in the allegory, some may discover something that they may have never considered before... the Bible is actually a book detailing a divine romance between God and His creation. It is easy to see how the ministry of Witness Lee (titles also available on Amazon) has influenced Gene's understanding of the Bible and contributed to his realization of the divine romance. One warning though, don't get stuck in the allegory-- let this book open your eyes to what may be a fresh perspective to God's plan for His chosen people."
5,AWESOME!!,"My Beloved God put this book into my hands by a person that I would never have expected! This book was given to me at the same time that He was bringing me into the revelation of the Bride! I read this book in one reading! I could not put it down! There are tears on every page of my book! I cried with wonder and excitement! This book blessed me so much that I want everyone to have a chance to read it! and let them decide what it means to them! Thank you, for letting me review this book online! It was marvelous, because all it spoke of was God's Unconditional Love and Righteousness for everyone! and that confirmed what He was telling me about the soul of man being His BELOVED!! Eve is being wooed back to her husband!! Eve represents the soul of man and Adam represents the one SPIRIT...GOD!!"
4,First rate!,"This is quite an extraordinary book! The author succeeded quite well in his imaginative but Biblical attempt to tell the story of our God - from creation onward. Though there are inevitable questions left unanswered & perhaps minor disagreement with the author's viewpoint, he seems definitely guided at least in part by revelation from God's Holy Spirit & shows great skill in his writing about a difficult subject. The only argument that I have with the book that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the author's failure to incorporate a conception of the Trinity into his story. His viewpoint seems closer to ""Jesus Only"" theology - but that does not spoil what is truthfully a very inspiring book!"
5,Truly is a beautiful love story,This book really helped me to SEE and now to experience just how much Father loves me. He gave His very own Son so that I could live with Him. Just an awesome love story.
2,Beautiful story but negative view of women,"This story is beautiful in its depiction of God's love for humanity, as a ""romance."" The problem is that it depicts woman as a lesser being than man, that woman is not in God's image, only man is. The idea that God is Male and Adam is therefore in God's image in a way Eve is not, I find unbiblical and personally abhorrent. I found that this depiction of the nature of woman, largely ruined the rest of the allegory for me."
2,I love Gene Edwards,"I love Gene Edwards, but I wasn't as crazy about this book as I have been about his books A Tale of Three Kings or Prisoner in the Third Cell. If you want to start reading Gene Edwards books, start with those first."
2,A Divine Disappointment,"Wonderful intentions on Mister Edwards's part. Sadly, missed it for me and my stylistic preferences. For a book to give you a warm feeling about how much God loves you in a time when you are already pretty much convinced thereof, it probably rates more like four stars. To address God's love for you amidst less than wonderful circumstances and even get by the tendency to cynicism that results in that state, I would suggest THE SACRED ROMANCE by Brent Curtis and John Eldredge."
2,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. The angelic world he portrays has the same silly (arghh!!) as the ""touched by an angel"" television show."
5,divine romance,This book changed my life. Edwards did a masterful job of making the love of God.What better way to make His love tanglible than by using a human perpective to show divine romance. I love this book and have given it as a gift on numerous occasions. Read it and weep...and rejoice!
1,Sterling Silver Celtic Dangle Earrings,"I bought three sets of these earrings for Christmas exchange gifts for our Bunco group, we are limited to $20.00. So I thought these looked like nice gifts, something I might wear myself. Both my daughter and myself thought they looked very cheap and not something I would feel comfortable giving as $20.00 gifts. Maybe $9.99 ?"
2,Celtic Fleur de Lis Earrings,"These earrings are very small, it is hard to see the beautiful design. That was very disappointing to me."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought the item was gona be a lot bigger than it was. I returned them because they were these little itty bitty earrings, which I would totally not wear."
2,Flimsy and over priced,I bought these for a gift and was disappointed. They're flimsy and kind of cheap feeling. More like a 5.99 pair of earrings.
1,Don't waste your money on garbage,"Overpriced junk. Not as pictured. If I could give it no stars, I would. And I will never buy jewelry on Amazon again."
1,"Great, if you don't mind leaky glasses","We bought some polycarbonate glasses from Williams and Sonoma eight years ago that we loved. After eight years, however, I needed to replace them. I bought these glasses two months ago and have had to throw almost all of them away because the bottoms crack and they leak. Don't buy these glasses! They are a waste of money!"
1,UNBREAKABLE GLASSES,These glasses all seem to end up with cracks at the bottom. It doesn't happen right away but within 5 or 6 months they start to crack on by one.
3,"Not quite ""Forever"" - cracked after 1 year","I received both these glasses and their matching highball glasses as a present. I love(d) them -- they are beautiful and look like real glass. After a year of dishwasher use, they are not cloudy or scratched, however (and it's a big ""however"") - the set is starting to crack along the lines of the bottom. I've had to throw away 4 glasses already, after having them for, at most, a year because they leak liquids out the bottom. Very disappointing!! (Not to mention ironic, considering that they chose the inaccurate name of ""Forever""!)"
3,Polycarb glasses,"I found these glasses and were very excited to get them. They had everything I wanted. The size, the shape and the slotted bottom so in the dishwasher the water ran off. They were wonderful for the first year. Then they all started getting hairline cracks in the bottom and leaking. I discovered that I did NOT follow the directions of removing them from the dishwasher for the heat cycle. Unfortunately I always forget and they stayed in there the whole time. I am very sorry they don't hold up because in every other respect I love them."
2,product ok - but did not realize you got only one glass!,"I was disappointed to see that it was ""one"" glass - my mistake - but the glass itself was disappointing $4.95 plus I believe about $6.00 for shipping..........wont do again."
2,Expensive for ONE glass,Kind of expensive for one glass. Cheaper for a set at Williams Sonoma. If I want to spend this much I can have them monogrammed for the same price!
1,Spend the extra money for a better seat,"Like one of the other reviews, I did a lot of research for all of my daughters products. I too was very happy with the graco infant seat, stroller, and pack and play. I am very disappointed in this seat. The strap release button is IMPOSSIBLE to get to in the rear facing position. The small head read rest constantly falls down so i end up having to put my daughter on top of it and then i have to fish it out from under her. I have many friends who have children around 4-12 mths old and they all highly recommend the Britax seat. I'm going to go out and get myself a seat that is user friendly."
1,Do NOT Buy This Car Seat!!!!!!!!,This carseat has my blood pressure through the roof!!!! It's very difficult to install rear facing and it's almost impossible to get to the strap release. Don't buy cheap like I did - it's worth speading more to get a good seat.
2,Spend more Money.,"We have a Britax car seat for our main car, but for our second car we decided to spend a little less and get this Graco car seat. If we could do it again we would spend the additional $150.00 and get the Britax. This car seat looks very uncomfortable for our baby, and is not very easy to install.Waste of money!"
2,Not good at what it claims,"Either i received an old worn out, defective piece or it doesnt do what it claims. It cudnt even hold the oil for an hour for me. Also i broke out in two places. Not pleased at all."
5,artifacts from Newark,"This record features two of the greatest modern musicians to ever come from Newark, NJ or anywhere. You probably have some Wayne Shorter in you collection right now, and if you do you definitely need some Grachan. He doesn't need Wayne's tunes, his own are just as amazing. Both Some Other Stuff and Evolution are easily among Blue Note's most special LPs. As per the RVG vs. McMaster deal, this stuff would sound fresh on your Fisher Price. I'll probably rebuy them if these Toshiba versions come down the pike, but until that day the Mosaic is still in heavy rotation."
3,Good book... for adults,"Macaulay draws as well as any architect, and his lengthy explanations of the architectural intricacies of a mosque's construction are clear. Unfortunately, it would be a rare child who would possibly be interested in any such thing, and this verbose, detailed picture book is not likely to draw them in. His books are more popular with the New York Times set who thinks children's books ought to be aimed at adults. However, this book may prove useful for kids in the 4th grade and up who need to do a report on mosques."
5,Another awe-strucking book by David Macaulay,"Mosque is David Macaulay's latest book on architecture. Macaulay does not get into politics and does not dwelve deep into religion; he just focuses on architecture.I have read all of Macaulay's other books (Castle, Cathedral, Underground, Ship, and City) and Mosque lives up to all the books he wrote and illustrated before. However, this book is Macaulay's first in color. All his other books were in black and white pen drawings. With the color in Mosque, you are able to picture the towering minarets and the grand interior of the mosque.Macaulay's books are a tribute to architecture and should not be overlooked. Buy this book!"
3,Pretty but small,"Pretty and comfortable, but quite small. I think these earrings were made for a child or early teen. They are quite comfortable and I can sleep in them, but they are very subtle. Good quality. I just wish they were a bit bigger in circumferance."
2,Very Average,I Like this One better than the first disc overall but Vocally speaking they were more closer to TLC or DEstinys Child than say En VOuge or Brownstone.The Music is very Hit&miss.What's Goin' On&every day of the week were Pretty Good songs.
2,5 4 3 2 (Yo! This CD Is Plain Ole Average!),"I bought the cassette when I was in high school because I liked the songs ""Everyday of the Week"" and ""5 4 3 2 (Yo! Time is Up). Let me tell you something: After I listed to it the first time, I got rid of it. The rest of the music was just too boring. You're not missing anything. Skip this."
4,Ponder with Person...and Benny Green,"As stated in the previous review, the title of this CD is ""Soul Eyes"". The picture is of Jimmy's daughter. Like Anders laid out, the format is a familiar one, with Ponder's favorite mix of blues groovers and standards, and the ballads he loves so. Jimmy will tell you that the studio is not the most comfortable place for him - he thrives on the 'give-and-take' from a Live audience, even to the point of not using a microphone to announce tunes, band members...himself, etc. He loves the intimacy of equality. Much like quantum physics, he believes that the observer is an integral part of the observed. Believe me, when you come away from a Jimmy Ponder Live date, you take a piece of Ponder home with you in your pocket! Again, 4 stars, only because the best is yet to come. Take that to the bank..."
5,Blues . Soul & Emotion in one package,"I think that the corrrect name of this album is SOUL EYES and not sad eyes as indicated here.This recording is from 1991, but well on the same artistic level as later albums from Ponder. Here we have Ponders usual ""brew"" ofHeavy Blues Swingers (Kansas City) Funk(All Blues)Standards(You are too beautiful) and Blues (You dont have to go) and that mix works. Ponder plays the simple riff on Kansas City single string.and he can ""outline the groove"" like noone else on tunes like this.Another highlight is ""You are too beautiful"" where Ponders solo will take any jazzguitar nut to ""heaven""Houston Persons sax playing is awesome he takes solo after solo that are loaded with soul and emotion.For Benny Green on piano I suppose this was pretty early in his career, but his playing is very mature and soulful here.If you are an addicted Ponder fan (like me)this one is a must have... as well as for any jazzguitarfan of the jazz that came out of the sixties."
3,"Um-hum, um-hum um-hum....","This group is competant, but Curious is really one of the only songs that will excite you. Their stuff is funky and at other times quirky. Curious is definitely solid though, it almost sounds like it really isn't them."
1,alan,"Believe it or not, this product shipped with the fan motor installed backwards.Some of the mounting holes also were not drilled in the proper spots.Amazon however was kind to credit me for the product considering its inadequate qualityand subsequent substantially longer installation time"
5,exhaust fan,quick delivery. exactly what I wanted. Fan works great and was an exact fit. You must be able to hot wire this product or get someone to do it for you
5,beautiful book,The photography in this book is wonderful. It was a great gift for a friend who loves butterflies.
2,OK but not as nice as I hoped....,"I purchased this game thinking it would be a nice addition to my LOTR paraphernalia. I was sorely dissappointed to see the Rings are plastic, not the metal I expected. Be aware."
4,Neat addition,"As expected, the rings are plastic, but that is not a total waste. The map in the underlying board is quite unique. I am an avid LOTR fan, and I enjoy many of their products. If you are just a normal fan, willing to play a cute game of checkers..have some fun! If you don't need the tin, I have seen the exact set at K*Mart for $7.99, but the checker board is cut, so it folds in four (not sure of this set)"
4,A humerous look at early WWII military life,"I've owned a copy of this book for as long as I can remember....I'm really not sure how I came to have it.This book is the story of one Mr. Finch who's life, by way of a letter from his Uncle Sam, is changed from that of a lazy desk-jockey to a (somewhat) lean, mean Army machine.Anyone who has an interest in the Army, WWII, or who just wants a laugh will appreciate the trials and tribulations of our dear Mr. Finch!"
4,Good album even with that long jammy thing,"The first six songs on this album are as good as anything on the acclaimed Forever Changes LP. She Comes in Colors is a particularly affecting piece of 60s folksy psychedelia. At times this band sounds like the Byrds, other times like Buffalo Springfield, and other times like the Aftermath era Stones.Yes, Revelation is an unfortunate piece of 60s excess that takes up far too much space and makes this album less than it could have been. But, putting something like this on an album seemed to be the fashion at the time when every band seemed to think they had to display their experimental jammy side. Still, the last five minutes of the ""song"" are not so bad as free form (albiet amateurish) saxophone jazz. Just fast forward when you come to this selection."
4,Classic!,"As an album, the jam Revelation filled one side of the LP, logging in at 16 or so minutes, and the other 6 songs were on the flip side. The extended jam missed the boat entirely, but the other 6 tunes are pure power pop heaven. For the most part, they rock harder than the tunes on Forever Changes. This would be a 5-star effort if it were not for Revelation. Some of Love's best tunes!"
4,"a preview of what to expect from ""forever changes""","40+ reviews on ""Forever Changes,"" and only one for this is a disservice to the band and the listeners. The last cut is the only song that is weak, yet even then it was in uncharted waters and leading the way for other bands. But the first six tracks are just as powerful and unusual as ""FC."" ""Que Vida!"" is just about the most gorgeous song I can imagine. And guess where the Stones' ""She's a Rainbow"" got its roots? Love's ""She Comes in Colors"" preceded it by a good year and kicks hell out of it. Take the risk. Arthur Lee was short-changed, for sure."
4,This one gets 4 1/2 stars.,"The first side (songs 1-6) is brilliant; it may be slightly dated, but better than anything else in American music in 1967. This album would have been in the same league as The Beatles' ""Revolver"" and gotten 5 stars if not for track 7, ""Revelation,"" which is a long jam usually done in concert, but does not easily translate in the recording studio. Either an error in judgement, or maybe they did not have enough songs for an LP. If you have a copy of the cd ""Love Story,"" you already have the first 6 songs, so you won't need this (you can re-sequence the songs to duplicate the original running order, though)."
1,LOVE - Da Capo,"I gave this album 1 star for the GREAT ""7 & 7 is"" cut. The rest is VERY DATED 60's MATERIAL. I found the music and songwriting quality very adolescent If you found a hit of Mr. Natural somewhere up in your attic behind the posters for Cal Jam 1 & 2 that you have been saving to sell of E-Bay take the hit, listen to this music, and remember that the Summer of Love was a GREAT time in the history of music but 35 years ago is a long time. Get some of LOVE's live stuff. They show better musicianship live."
2,Sucks...,"This album sucks except to the two tune ""Seven plus Seven Is"" and ""She Comes in Colors"". I bought it anyway knowing this 'cause I wanted a complete discography of Love. I found the rest of the song plain bad and very pretentious..."
3,Worth it for the first side,"Da Capo is really only half an album. Side 2 consists of ""Revelation,"" a nearly 20-minute exercise in whacked-out mediocrity. It is a thoroughly pointless jam. At the time of its release, I suppose it was fairly groundbreaking to put out an album that has one track filling an entire side. Too bad that one track wasn't any better than this. I find it pretty unbearable to wade through.But the first side of the album is pretty great, and well worth the purchase price. I'm not too crazy about the first track, ""Stephanie Knows Who,"" which to me sounds like a demented ""What's New, Pussycat?"". ""The Castle"" is also one of the lesser songs here. But McLean's ""Orange Skies"" is a classic, as is ""7 and 7 Is,"" a driving, punky rocker that never lets up until a final atomic blast at the end. (The flip side to the single of ""7 and 7 Is,"" was, appropriately, a song called ""Fourteen."")The first side is classic Love at its best."
4,REVELATION ? HARDLY!,"Side one of this record is amazing. Love were already moving light years ahead of the patchy, jangle rock of their first album- witness 7 and 7 is. Orange Skies would have to be my all time favourite candy-coated love song and Stephanie Knows Who is just plain unsettling. How many 3 minute songs can veer from harpsichord driven whimsy through punk rock aggression, culminating in a devastating free-jazz sax solo and back again? It is quite breathtaking on first listen and it only gets better with repeat listenings.Side Two, however, begs the question- WHAT THE **** WERE THEY THINKING???? Never has a record disappeared up it's own arse more spectacularly than Da Capo. You MUST buy this record, but just set your CD player to ignore REVELATION as repeated listenings will only leave you shaking your head, mystified that such a travesty could be allowed to appear on what is an otherwise superb selection of songs."
3,Camera case,"I bought this for my new Canon PowerShot SX200 IS camera, to wear on my belt as I traveled. The bag is of excellent quality, a good size for the camera and has a pocket for an extra battery etc. Unfortunately, for me it was much too bulky to carry around and I ended up getting a much lighter bag made by Zing that also had room for an extra batter and/or card and was also very durable. For my purpose I would rate it a 3, but it rates a 4 or 5 in quality of construction."
5,I can fit all my compnents in the case,"I purchased this for my Canon SD1000 P&S. I like the bag. I use the front pocket for the battery charger (a cozy fit!) and in the main pocket, I store the camera, USB cable, extra battery and extra SD card. Also comes with a shoulder strap."
4,Clock review,"The clock keeps good time. There's a dimmer on the display; however, I found it hard to read the time during the day even when it's set at its brightest (Mine has green light.). I found the clock a bit complicated to set because of the variety of options- radio, alarm, 2 alarms, etc. I wonder why they put a black cord on a white clock."
5,beautiful picture,Randall Lake is an amazing artist. This rendition of the Catalina casino where the Jazzfest is held every year is gorgeous. I had it framed with a nice linen mat and Italian wood frame and it looks fabulous!
1,Dull and unimaginative,"A very poor example of the 'captured and forced to submit against her will' fantasy. The characters are not developed, the scenes lack eroticism or imagination. This book feels like it was written on auto-pilot with the same old cliches strung together with an unbelievable plot."
2,Disappointed..,The story lacks imagination.. A very poor example of the 'captured and forced to submit against her will' fantasy. I reads like one continuous sex scene after another after another with no variation...
5,A REAL AMERICAN HERO,I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES VERY MUCH. I REMEMBER THE OLD MOVIES OF JOE DON BAKER PLAYING THE MAIN PART.
2,Fair,"Here's the TV-movie version of the Buford Pusser story. Although it is not nearly as gripping as the theatrical film ""Walking Tall"" (starring Joe Don Baker), it is definitely a cut above the awful sequels with Bo Svenson. Brian Dennehy, as usual, delivers a solid performance, and his fans will enjoy it. It's not a great film, but not bad, either. It's definitely worth a look, just for Dennehy's performance."
1,A real pile of dung.,"As a Buford Pusser ""Walking Tall"" fan I was certainly disappointed with this TV film of the Tennessee hero. As a movie fan, this ranks as one of the worst veiwing experiences of my life."
4,Intriguing.,"An intriguing, well-written, but skeptical look at a fascinating phenomenon. Zola, the (lapsed) Catholic, is far more dubious about the apparitions than the Jewish Franz Werfel in his ""The Song of Bernadette"" (which I love). Both, however, are very respectful toward the admirable visionary, Bernadette Soubirous."
3,Just find questions off the internet,"I'm a cfi, cfii, mei and one thing is for sure, on my orals I've never really been asked questions out of these books."
4,As expected,"I have every oral exam guide by Michael Hayes, and this one was as good as the rest of them. The thing was, I didn't really need an oral exam guide for the multi-engine. My exam was pretty specific to the airplane I was flying, and then we went over the aerodynamics, but I wasn't really helped or hurt by having read this guide."
5,Macasite heaven,"This piece of jewelry is more stunning on, than photographed. Although I expected it to be a little bit larger - it is fine the way it is. I love wearing it with matching earrings I found on the same website."
4,Great book!!,"The patterns are amazing; I was inspired by a skirt shown with the sweater. Instructions are easy to read and the stitch guage is clearly indicated. However, I am having some difficulty finding the specified yarn in my area, generic yarns from the big chain stores may not give the best product."
1,For beginners only,"I was very disappointed with this book. Too generic and high level to a reader to get much out of it. It should be considered for net mgt beginners only. There are other, better beginner books on the market."
4,See it first,"I was a little disappointed, should have researched more in depth. I bought this watch because fo the Movado name but I thought the band looked brushed and it felt heavy. Look and try on before you buy online to make sure you will like the style of the watch. It's hard to return items like this if you opened and tried on the merchandise. A costly mistake on my part."
5,Incredible,"This is a wonderful CD. It was a total surprise. It is toe tapping, soul searching, uplifting and encouraging music. It doesn't get much better than that."
3,It's ok,"I was excited to try Westcott's Photo Basic line of constants so I bought two of these. I ended up using just one and a constant fill light and use a strobe as a main light. I'm not happy about the power - I wish there was a way to adjust the power as you do on a strobe. It's just a light. I'm also disappointed that the barn doors do not fit - they fit the reflector fine, but nothing fits around the giant bulb. That was a HUGE disappointment since I bought two sets of barn doors and gels!! The gels are useless since they can't fit over the bulb. All in all, it's ok."
4,"An Honest ""Down to Earth"" Investigation.","I have watched this DVD many times, and never get tired. Nick Cook does an excellent job of research, investigation, and personal interviews with witnesses all over the planet! For anyone interested in UFology, or UFO investigations, this is an excellent choice.Nick's personality is both serious and honest. He brings his vast experience and training to the field. Many enthusiasts of the UFO phenomenon will be pleased with this presentation. It is not filled with the usual ""Special Effects"" common to most UFO-DVD choices. Just hard core research and investigation.You can't go wrong adding this volumn to your personal library."
5,Best 35 dollar upgrade out there,"Product it great. relitivly simple to install and is a night and day difference for the truck, gets rid of that sagging rear end the explorers are famous for"
5,Add-a-Leaf kit give truck new life!,I recently installed these springs in my 1996 Dodge Ram 1500 and it may be the best $41 I have spent on it. It raised the saggy OEM leaf springs back to where they should be. Overall ride is improved and load carrying capacity is much better. Installation was a piece of cake.
2,only got 1 inch of lift :(,installed these on a 1996 dodge ram 1500 4x4...this was supposed to add 1.5 to 2.5 inches of lift.we measured before and after and it was only 1 inch...not very satisfied with that.the components seem to be good quality and the fit was perfect...too bad they underestimated the lift.
5,smooth evil touch!,"This is the book of the 2002 movie version. A vampire-type terror tale. At first, the story feels a little sluggish, a couple in the city finding an apartment. But soon screams and dreams add to curious events. All isn't so cozy."
2,A dissent view,"Finished the book last night and the ending was a surprise. It was, as another reviewer noted slow to start. The tempo improved but it never quite reached its full potential. The characters and and plot lack maturity and could have been better developed. The story line is interesting but is it is light reading overall. After completing it I felt vaguely unsatisfied, as if I had eaten carrots when I craved chocolate."
2,No resemblance to the great music of the 70's.,"This 1994 release by the once great Banco is very disappointing. This is a much harder sounding recording than anything Banco recorded in the seventies. The subtleties of their earlier work is lost here and has been given over to sheer volume and a much harder edge to their sound. The new keyboardist is adequate at best. His reliance on already dated sounding digital keyboards really detracts from the music. Uncharacteristicaly, the vocals sound rough and strained. There is little reward to be found in this recording. Stick to their seventies output, Come In Ultima Cena and Io Sono Nato Libero in particular...Simon"
5,Would you like an extra pillow?,"Finally on DVD. Love it. I first saw this mistresspiece about the same time as the equally wacky, sex-drenched Tromeo and Juliet (What? You didn't know Juliet had a lesbian lover?), and it has lost none of its magic.Other reviewers have described it well, so I won't overkill the story line. While this is a lightweight look at the S & M industry/subculture, it is genuinely entertaining, with Chris Anholt (Tia Carrere's sidekick in Relic Hunter) perfectly cast opposite the Divine Guin Turner - check out Go Fish and Chasing Amy.Apart from being sheer entertainment with a great soundtrack, the movie captures the madness by which corrupt and perverse Government officials presume to judge a subculture in which the genderless, non-hierarchical role-playing is actually very sane and healing.Hilarious, sexy, exciting. I hope they make a sequel with the same cast."
4,Stylish and Funny,"This is a marvelous movie (not five star since I save that for things that stand the test of time) -- funny, stylish, delighting in itself. The background players, many of them actual members of the London Fetish scene, seem to be having a marvelous time and are definitely eye candy. The story is simple and the humor somewhat predictable, but the sets and costumes make it worth watching."
4,I could definitely own this one,"I really enjoyed this one. The story was quite cute and it showed simple clips into the world of BDSM, it wasn't overpowering."
4,Truly enjoyed it!,"I never thought an indie movie about dominance and submission would be interesting all the way through, but I truly enjoyed it. My eyes were glued to the screen. If you like the idea of BDSM, then give this movie a try. I give it four stars."
3,And yet another mystery song,"hey, I just saw the movies I found the soundtrack alright. I'm looking for the song heard at the end . It goes something like ""he's the kind of guy who's always passing by..."". Does anyone know which song is it?Thanx"
3,Just to Help Out....,"I havent bought the soundtrack and I'm not sure if I want to because the song at the end which some of you are mentioning isnt found on there.... Its called ""Charm Attack"" and its Leona Naess... its a really good song...."
2,Where's Charm AttacK?,This CD would be absolutely prefect if Charm Attack by Leona Naess (i know thats spelled wrong) was on it. It is by far one of the coolest songs ever recorded and it was really stupid for the movie people not to put it on the soundtrack.
4,music fits perfectly for the movie- cute but not too cute,"The movie was an excellent example of an original teen movie, something a little different, even if the guy did end up with the girl. The music seemingly fit the movie perfectly, slow tunes for the sweet parts, and hard rock for the fast parts. You'll find a few keepers on this cd, Jeremy Toback for one, you may find a few losers on this cd, Melanie C. I suggest if you like a song, go buy that artist, this cd is a mixed bag."
2,~*deadsy*~,"For sure, this soundtrack is not too bad, but ""fox on the run"" by deadsy is sick. They are an awesome band, and that song, along with some of their others, sound like orgy and the 80's. The boys are super nice and it's very fun music! Deadsy forever, lookout, you'll being hearing from them in the future positively."
3,To Music Fan From South Carolina,"I just had the same problem... I bought the cd (which isn't bad... the Jessica Riddle song is great) looking for the song on the trailer, only to find it wasn't included. But, after a little research, I discovered the song was Fire Escape by the band Fastball. Hope that helps."
2,?????,"I haven't actually listened to the CD (my bad), but I just watched the movie and what is the name of the song w/ the lyrics that go something like ""out of my mind...something something something...."" into your heart may be the rest of it. Merci."
3,In Search of Another Mystery Song,"Alright, I haven't bought the cd yet, but was specifically looking for another song that's apparently not featured. Anyone know where to find the accordion song played in the movie? I believe it's by the Talking English, and goes something like, ""I'll Stop the World and Melt for You... I've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time..."" I couldn't believe they don't feature it here since it was instrumental to one of the pivotal scenes. If anybody has a clue, I'd be most grateful. Thanks."
3,"""Go"" is right!","The only song that makes this album worthy of ANY stars is most definitely Mel C's ""Go!"". This song is so energizing and Sporty Spice is really rockin it on this one! It's totally worth buying her whole album, ""Northern Star,"" if you love this choon as much as I do...all the songs are awesome!"
2,song at the hotel,Does anyone know what the music that was playing at the hotel is called?The only good song on this soundtrack is Red Alert by Basement Jaxx.
4,it was good,i thought it was good~umm what is the song that was played at the end when they were showin credits??
3,Kids were entertained....,"This movie seemed to entertain my children, however I wanted them to understand the nutcracker ballet before brining them to it - and the plot seemed to deter slightly from the original story."
4,Insightful account,"Bertrand Russell gives an in-depth account and analysis of the problems faced by China during the early 20th century. While analyzing the dynamics at play on the global front, he also attempts to identify the three most pressing issues which China faced internally--the need for an orderly government, industrial development under Chinese control and the spread of education. Notwithstanding the fact that he is a Westerner, he strives to debunk myths and prevailing misconceptions of the Chinese people. Russell writes elegantly and this book is indeed a remarkable account for those who wish to learn more about China."
5,Even good for western people to understand current China,"In this book, Bertrand Russell expressed his ideas about both the positive and negative characters of Chinese. It can only be written after carefully thinking over what are in Chinese people's mind. And only you have been to China for over 6 months can you really understand what he really means. This is perhaps the best book for western people to learn the way of thinking of Chinese and the character of the Chinese people. After reading the book I think people will rebuild an idea about China, thus they can understand the Chinese people in American better."
5,Well Ahead of its Time,"This work reads like it was written within the past five years, instead of over 80 years ago. Mr. Russell traces the history of China (and Japan) against the backdrop of Western nations and their interest and plans for the Far East. And when he wrote (in the 1920s) that ""war between Japan and America is inevitable,"" it made me realize how smart and insightful a man he was. Well worth the read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A story more on the suspense side, than the gore end of the scale. Agroup of cultists is recruiting and must be stopped, all that sort ofthing. This one was made into a movie with the most excellentChristopher Lee presiding. Wheatley is fairly tame, as far as horrornovelists go, it is all quite a bit more old fashioned."
3,speakers,cheap speakers but alright for laptop. Like the idea of them coupling together for easy transport or mounting. they are alright for the price.
4,Great for quiet spaces,"I use these every day at my place of work. They're easily audible (run from an iPod) in the quiet room. I am getting another pair for listening to audio from my Palm when I'm at home.In. A. Quiet. Room.These speakers are *not* amplified in any way (which is why they have no plug, which is great when you've got to be really portable). That means they are practically useless in average noise environments. For example, a car. They're not much good outside unless you're right on top of them.But for indoor use in quiet areas, they're small and low-profile."
2,"Okay for iPod, LOUSY for laptop","When they say ""Passive,"" they're not kidding -- As many of the 1-star reviews have stated, these are actually quieter (read: barely audible) than laptop internal speakers. Although they did kick out a little more sound from an iPod Nano than if you plugged in headphones and cranked to to eleven. Moral of the story: if you plan on listening in a fixed location, get a set of powered speakers; if you plan on listening to an mp3 player on the go, these will do a mediocre job for just ten bucks. There is likely a better bargain speaker out there though."
4,Happy for the price,"I got these at Walmart for around $10 because I wanted some speakers that did not run on batteries. For ten bucks, I can't really complain. It sounds alright and are really easy to carry around (just hook them together on the bottom and wrap the cord around it). A major downside to these speakers is that they really don't have any bass. I normally use these with my ipod so it's nice to have them when I can't lug around my stereo system, but I do have to turn up the volume all the way for the music to sound moderately loud. The battery use on the ipod doesn't seem to be cut down either or at least I haven't noticed. If your looking for some cheap speakers and are willing to sacrifice SOME sound, then these are the speakers for you."
4,Decent little speakers,"I bought these speakers after the internal speakers on my laptop gave out. I use them for watching video or listening to streaming radio at my desk and they work fine for this purpose. The volume is sufficient for video/background music and the sound quality isn't bad. I wouldn't recommend them if you want to listen to loud/heavy bass music as the volume won't go that high and the bass is pretty lacking. Another consideration is the device that you plan to use them with - Because they are passive, you need a device that can power the speakers, so they will probably work better with a computer than a low-power mp3 player or something like that."
4,Convenience over sound quality? It depends.,"What you get out of these speakers will depend very much on what you plug them into. I have plugged them into 3 devices with very good results, in terms of volume; and pretty darned adequate results, in terms of sound quality.I have used them with my Dell Inspiron 1420 laptop, my Creative Zen Vision:M MP3 player, and my Blackberry 8330 Curve, all of which are capable of providing enough signal to these speakers to be too loud for the typical office environment. I absolutely loved the improvement in the experience of these plugged into my laptop whilst watching a movie in bed, with the smallish speakers laying on either side of the lapdesk.For what they are intended to offer you, these are a good value, and seem to be well enough made to be fairly durable."
1,Inadequate...you get what you pay for.,"These are the worst speakers I've ever bought. I thought these would sound better than the measly speakers on my portable DVD player...WRONG! I was better off with the dinky speakers on my DVD. But if you love cheap, AM frequency, low volume speakers, these are the speakers for you."
1,Can you hear it now?,"I have had 2 other sets of speakers for my portableSony CD player, but they required batteries. Idecided to try these Sony PASSIVE speakers that don't requirebatteries. I can barely hear them when I have the CDplayer at full volume. You would think with today'stechnology that Sony or someone could make PASSIVE speakerswith great sound quality without requiring batteriesto power them.Go figure."
2,Mini speakers,"It's better than nothing if your intregrated sound card fails and you need some audio. However, the volume is exeeding weak."
1,horrible,This product is horrible; the sound from speakers is 10 times less than a normal laptop has. I seriously suggest this is the worst ever product made by sony.
1,worst speakers,I bought these a few years ago and terrible treble. no wonder they were 20 bucks. on top of that the bass sucks. these speakers are terrible.
1,"Inexpensive, but not worth it.","For a typical MP3 player, the passive speakers have too low a sound output. Also, the quality is thin and uninspired. Don't waste your money."
4,Cheap reliable speakers,"I use these when I am outside grilling or hanging out and I dont feel like bringing out my stereo and want to hook my ipod up. They dont recharge the ipod, nor are they very loud. But for a quick hookup, portable, and a low volume music option they are great. I have used them on fishing trips, and around the house for over a year. They are still going strong. They also connect together so they are easy to carry around. I bought two pairs and still havent opened the other set in over a year. I like them."
1,Waste of money,These speakers actually make the sound from my computer sound worse! My mac internal speakers are even louder then these. Don't waste your money.
1,not worth it,"yeah so i bought these today at wal-mart with the plan that i would be able to use them with my ipod but no, they suck. i mean, its ten bucks so i wasnt expecting anything special but these arent even worth the ten bucks. im so over sony, i havent really had a good experience with them and yeah... no more sony for me..."
1,DONT BY THESE SPEAKERS!!!,"DONT BY THESE SPEAKERS!!! I repeat DONT BY THESE SPEAKERS!!! They are passive which means they do not amplify the sound. They say good for walkmans, but you cant here them. Sound quality is OK. NO BASS! I bought these and I can hardly hear them when my walkman is on full power. This also waists ALOT of battery power. I conclude DONT BY THESE SPEAKERS!!!"
2,Sony SRS-P7 Passive Speakers (no external power needed),"Ok, 2 Sony SRS-P7 Passive Speakers each 2.8 inches(w) x 4 inches(h) x 2.5 inches(d)$8.50 (amazon). I attempted to use these to increase the the volume on my G1 phone, however, my phone's tiny speaker was louder than these.I also tried on other devices (sansa mp3 player (no speaker on device, headphone jack only), zen mp3 player (headphone jack only), acer laptop) and still way to low. Even my acer laptop speakers (cheapest speakers on the planet, so I thought) were louder than these sony passive speakers. My conclusion is the sound of them is clear, but they are passive and without power they just have no volume. I did keep them as they could come in very handy with my mp3 players that have only a headphone jack to hear radio, etc. (especially in a power outage). Hope this helps others."
1,These passive speakers made me passive-aggressive.,"Well, I got these for free at a garage sale, so I can't complain too much. These do have their application. If you've got a kid who likes to play computer games and you don't want him or her to crank up the sound so that you can hear it all through the house, then these speakers will be right for you. You just plug them into your computer's speaker output, crank up your computer's on-screen volume controls all the way, and you can actually hear sound! Amazing.I really feel sorry for those who ordered a pair and paid money for them. Sony has proven it can build junk like the best...or...uh...worst of 'em."
4,Great voice,"Great singer. I'd also like to recommend John Berry's ""Blessed Assurance"" from the very fine AMAZING GRACE CD (Sparrow Records) from 1995. I'm no bible thumper, but that's about a fine a recording of that old church chestnut I've ever put my ear to.On the other hand, Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart is pretty lame LP"
4,Good ol' country music,"John Berry is out of the current mainstream of country music -- too bad. He sure is a good singer. Finding good, traditional country music is hard. So glad Amazon has so many vendors to assist with this. Their prices selection is usually very good/cheap. Every single used CD I have ordered, has arrived on time or earlier than projected."
3,Great idea however didn't deliver the goods.,"I enjoyed this film for what it offered and found the comedy fairly amusing for the most part. This would be an OK date movie. It addresses discrimination, but in a funny way that makes it acceptable and easy to take without being too heavy. Some of the humor was in line with slap stick ( no pun intended ) and I will admit it had some fairly funny scene's. I enjoy Cuba Gooding Jr. in many of his films however this was not one of his better works. The story had promise but failed to deliver in the end ( no pun intended ). I recommend you rent it first and then make the call on buying. This has adult subject matter and would be in questionable taste to show to mixed crowds. Not one of my better purchases."
1,The plot sunk way before the end!,"This is the worst movie ever! How can I prove that to you? Well, I LOVE the movie ""Showgirls""! Two buddies, Nick and Jerry think they've got on a singles cruise ship, but what they got on was a gay man's single cruise. The plot is easier to read through than air. It can't even hold up it's plot. For example: half way through, the gay man thing got old so they placed dozens of women on the GAY MAN'S ONLY ship. It's truely an insult to hetrosexuals (myself) and mostly to homosexuals. Avoid this!"
4,Boat Trip,"SAW THIS MOVIE ON TELEVISION AND JUST HAD TO ORDER IT SO I COULD SEE THE ""WHOLE THING"".....IT MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD AND WHAT FUN CUBA GOODING JR IS....I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT GUY !!!!!!!!! ROSELYN SANCHEZ IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES....CAN'T LEAVE OUT FUNNY GUY HORATIO SANZ...THE COMBINATION OF SANZ AND GOODING WAS PERFECT....SO GLAD I ORDERED THE MOVIE ""BOAT TRIP"" FOR MY COLLECTION."
2,skip it,dont see this movie. it is not funny it is offensive to gays and i dont know wat cuba was thinking avoid it
3,"funny, but wierd","my aunt had me watch boat trip with her.. its that one movie where those two guys accedently got on a gay cruise... it was... kinda... uhh... weird. most of the movie was just [...] jokes and [...] jokes. it was funny... but it was wierd. at the end of the movie i walked out and the only thing i could say was, ""...uhhh...""its not all bad though"
1,Can you give less than one star?,This is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. With a boneheaded formulaic plot line there is nothing unpredictable and certainly nothing funny. I love Cuba Gooding Jr. and cannot be more disappointed with his choice to participate in this movie.Not only is the Horatio Sans character not funny but his openly hateful views that turn into his confusion over whether or not he himself is gay are so offensive I cannot believe no one involved with this movie thought to stop it. I love a good drag queen or gay joke as much as the next person but this is just down right stupid.If this movie doesn't ruin a few careers I don't know what could.
1,Awful,"What happens when a recently dumped straight man and his oafish best friend accidently find themselves on a gay cruise? A big mess. ""Boat Trip"" is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Filled with crude sexual humor and goofy sight gags, ""Boat Trip"" is rarely funny and often offensive. Apparently, the makers of this film were trying to cash in on the recent explosion of gay culture in the media, but after watching this film I have a funny feeling that the writers have never even met an actual gay person. Tired and ridiculous stereotypes are all this film really has to offer. Charming Cuba Gooding Jr. and sexy 'n sassy Vivca A. Fox should fire their agents immediately."
2,"Stupid movie, even more stupid DVD","Vibrant Cuba Gooding, Jr. and dim-witted Horatio Sanz are two love hungry guys who decide to take a cruise to pick up on some good old lady lovin', but end up being the only two straight guys on a very non-heterosexual cruise. The premise to this movie sounded like it could be really funny: two straight guys on a cruise full of gay men. You could definitly do some funny things with that, but Boat Trip just made it really sappy. It also was full of some really stupid and crude humor that really wasn't funny at all. I did like Cuba's performance and Roger Moore was just funny as hell as a gay guy, but other than that this movie was just flat out stupid. The film had a very choppy and unstable execution. And the extras on the DVD have to be the most worthless extras on a DVD I have ever seen. Who really cares about Tanning Tips with Playboy Playmates? Worthless."
3,Comedy anyone?,Had a few really good laughs. Good movie to watch if you in a mood to watch a believe-able comedy. Bottom line (lol) 3 stars not 4 or 3.5 but only 3.
1,I'd rather have a root canal...,"This could perhaps be the DUMBEST movie that I've ever seen. I didn't find one thing funng/entertaining/charming about the entire flick. The portrayal of both gay men and women was horribly stereotypical and pretty disgusting. In fact, I agree with the reviewer who wrote that it seems like the topless women were just thrown in to entice straight men to watch this horrible film. It's a shame that Cuba Gooding Jr. has his name on this one, because I think he (usually) has a tremendous amount of talent.Unless you like movies with no plots that make fun of gay men and show women as commodities, give this one a miss."
3,A Boatride Filled With Laughs!,"After Being turned down by his girlfriend in a maraige proposalCuba Gooding Jr. leads the lonely life until one day his bestfriend convinces him to take a sigles cruise filled with beautiful women not knowing that the cruise is actually for gay men only. The laughs and sick gags keep on coming in this silly but still hillarious comedy giving Gooding a charming appeal,especally former 007 Himself Roger Moore In A supporting role asa gay old timer who tries to hit on Gooding's best friend The scene when Moore was licking a pickle was so funny i fell off my chair roaring with laughter. Granted this film is far from beingan Oscar contender and it won't be long remembered but it made me laugh and that's what a comedy is supposed to do."
1,Boat Trip; uncut,"I wouldn't of purchased if I knew this was an uncut version. This was not disclosed and I didn't know there was going to be nudity in this movie. I prefer the version without the nudity, this did not add any value, in fact it lowed my enjoyment of the movie. Really, is your imagination that bad? Ridiculous. I have seen the edited version and that is what I thought I was purchasing. I din't know there were other versions out there. Next time I will email the seller before purchasing a movie. I would give the edited version 4 stars."
2,Some May Love It - Some May Not,"Some folks have complained that this film is offensive to gay men. This is not entirely true. It is offensive to any living, breathing human being. Not just that it presents gays as stereotypical sissies (how daring is that?), but the story is so over-bloated and rehashed with TV level unintelligence, that it's drolly unwatchable. Cuba Gooding, Jr. seems to have had a bad run of movies lately and Horatio Sanz is the non-humorous, overweight sidekick with no good lines. You know the plot. It's no more than what is in the previews. The only thing believable about this film was Roger Moore as an older 'queen' and that scared the ""living daylights"" out of me!Note that his film is unrated. There is no nudity and very little foul language. However there is a scene that I cannot describe here. Just think a 'gay' version of ""There's Something About Mary"" and hair gel. Unbelievably tacky awful stuff. You were warned."
1,No Stars - Dreadful!,"I like Cuba Gooding Jr. and was surprised he chose to do such an awful movie. I'll agree with reviewer ""Marty from SF"" that it is 'offensive to any living human being' - however, there was plenty of nudity in the edition I saw...he said there was none. This movie seems like the type of movie teenage boys would love (topless girls, completely lame sex jokes) and that ordinarily you'd find unknown teenage actors starring in - not an Academy Award winner...oh yeah, and written by teenage boys too...in about an hour (my apologies to any teenage boys who are above this). Spend your twenty bucks on something else. This is really...really...bad."
3,Not impressed.,"The only reason I gave this movie three stars is because James Bond, aka, Roger Moore portrays a homosexual.Priceless.All in all, I was not impressed. I usually love Cuba Gooding, Jr. but in this film I felt his acting was a bit contrived.You're welcome."
2,Invest your time in something else,"This is a pathetic, boring, offensive movie with an excuse of a ""plot"" which seems to hinge on topless models and rude jokes about gay men.I am embarrassed for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who tries to add some life to this shell of a picture, but can't quite pull off the miracle it would take to bring this corpse of a movie to life.Cuba and his friend (an annoying leg-humper type) go on a cruise and are sent on a gay cruise. Of course a helicopter full of lovely ladies literally drops in, and it's all very stupid and boring and tasteless.I'd steer clear of this."
5,Kudo's For Cuba,"I didn't think he could pull it off, but he did and had me laughing all the way out of the theatre. This is an excellent movie. I have been checking back every couple of weeks to find out when it was going to be released on DVD. I am happy to see I won't have to wait much longer."
3,not as crucial as it once was now that all the albums were reissued...but does have one unique b-side..,"I bought this album ages ago because it had loads of non-single tracks that were never on CD before. But now that Cherry Red has reissued all the AFOS albums with bonus tracks, the ONLY track on this CD that you won't find elsewhere is the instrumental track Rosenmontag, a b-side that is presented here in it's 7"" length. So if you are an AFOS completist, that is the one reason to buy this collection..."
3,"Lovely presentation, but not easy to use","The best-looking recipe shown in the photos is a roasted chicken. The only problem is I can't find the oven temperature anywhere. Also, the recipe was listed in the index on the wrong page. So my confidence is shaken although it is clear chef Patterson knows his stuff. Can someone clear this up?"
2,Too Much Info for An Average Cook!,"I should have respected a few other reviewers and not purchase this book. After I got it, with ""Cooking"" by the same author, I returned it because it was ""too much."" The ""Cooking"" book by the same author was okay, but if you add this book with ""Cooking,"" it is overkill. ""Cooking"" by itself is good unless you are ""big"" into sauces. I was not impressed, and I am a ""good"" cook but not with a lot of time that ""Sauces"" required to get the sauces right."
3,Good but not great,"If you want names, ingredients and recipes this is the book. If you want to understand sauces so you can cook without a book, then skip this one."
2,sauce james,we bought this book for my son- he is in his first year of culinary school in dallas. he wants to specialize in sauces and was thrilled with this book. it is the best sauce book on the market.
5,Updated Go-To For Sauces,"Peterson certainly is establishing himself as chef whom chefs go to for resource, e.g. his excellent soup volume, essentials in techniques, etc. This is available and useful for chef wannabes as well.It is massive in nearly 600 pages, and includes history, then equipment discussion, then sauce basics of stocks, glaces, essences, liaisons. Then into the whites, browns, nonintegral and integrals, jellies, egg-yolk, dessert, etc.What makes this such a valuable friend in ones gourmet library is that here is place where organized, trustworthy basics or specific recipe to complete a recipe is available in well done format, with some photos. There as well is wine advice, glossary, bibliography, four page source directory with item distinguishment.Call this a must for the serious cuisine minded."
4,Like a textbook for a sauce-making course,"I ordered this book after enjoying the author's Vegetables. I love the photos, but there is just too much information for me. If I were serious about learning how to make really complicated sauces, then I think I'd get more use out of this book. But I was a bit overwhelmed after flipping through it on my first look, so it's on my shelf right now."
3,Good Source for Someone Who is Really Into Cooking,"First let me say that while this book is big, thick and heavy, it is VERY poorly organized if you are in a hurry. If you like to sit down and actually read a cookbook, then this book is a good source. If you need a quick reference for ""something to throw on this piece of chicken"" this book is not for you. It does a very good job of defining types of sauces, ingredients and so forth and the recipes are good ones. The book also seems to be quite complete in it's variety of recipes."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,"When we bought this manual for the office (which had just switched over from eudora to outlook as an e-mail system), I assumed it would be helpful and at least answer many of the questions that various co-workers were asking regarding the software. I hoped that it would help us use outlook to streamline our office tasks and mailing databases as well. Unfortunately, we were ..... Not only is the book elementary (nothing new was learned), but there is NO TUTORIAL. Sure, there is a CD-ROM attached with the book, but the only files on it are a word file of something already in the book, directions on how to get to BCR (whatever that is) from the Denver Airport, and a diagram of a librarian. Why? No idea. We are returning this book, as it's not worth the money."
4,"Comfortable, but will fail! Read on.","This chair is very comfortable, but the bungee/elastic rope that holds the canvas in place broke in less than a year and it was never in the sun or left outside to the elements. I read this complaint in several reviews before I bought the chair so it was no surprise. Lafuma sells replacement kits for $20, but you can do much better by Googling 3/4 inch bungee cord. I bought 50 feet for less than $10, including delivery on ebay. That's enough to re-string the chair 3 times and it works just as well. Do one side at a time so you can copy the stringing pattern on the good side. No need to do the other side until it breaks which did happen eventually, also in less than a year, but I tied the broken ends together and it's still holding. The bottom line for me is the chair works very well and I'm glad I bought it."
2,Good quality but Really Really Thin,"I bought this comforter because of all the other positive reviews I read on the site. The good news: The comforter arrived very promptly, even with the free standard shipping option. The Cons: When I opened up the package, I was disappointed to see how light and thin the comforter was...definitely not something you can use to dive under the covers with on a cold winter's day. It was thinner than a generic down comforter I bought at a local Bed Bath Beyond (which cost less)! It just wasn't as thick and warm as I had hoped. After putting the comforter into my duvet cover you can barely tell there was anything inside. So despite the good quality construction, I am disappointed."
3,"Not what I expected, but good for the price..","Affordable, warm, great texture. However it does lack the weight I sought. I've only used it for a couple of months and it looks different from the time of purchase. It is very comfortable, and hopefully it will last."
2,"Ok quality, so thin it feels like a summer comforter","I was disappointed, because given all the positive reviews I was expecting the most awesome comforter ever. It's nice - the construction is good, the packaging is good. But you take it out of the box and, well, it's pretty flimsy. It's about as warm and thick as my summer comforter from the Company Store. Therefore, I returned it. I wanted something for winter, not for summer with the A/C on. I'm surprised it got such good reviews, as I found it to be really thin and not at all luxurious and plush like a down comforter should be. Oh well!"
5,Comforter,The Royal Velvet Grandeur Hungarian White Goose Down King Comforter is well made and there is no sign of the filling migrating from where it is supposed to be. The degree of insulation is just right for the average summer bedroom temperature where it is being used (basement in N. Utah).
4,Nice quality but not winter weight,This is a nice quality comforter but was much thinner than the one I was replacing. It is more of a good summer comforter. It is a good fit for my California King bed - it seemed a little wider than our last one.
4,Warm as toast,This is the first down comforter I've ever owned and its created a whole new sleeping experience for me. The weight is less than half of what I'm used to and no matter the temperature in the room the temperature under the comforter always seems to remain constant. The price is great for a product of this quality. If you do buy one you should also plan on investing in a cover for it.
4,Royal Velvet Down Comforter,Great product. Too hot for Florida but would be great for a colder climate. I had to send it back because it was so hot. Other than that it was great.
4,comfortable,"I really like this comforter, it keeps in the warmth which is what i was looking for. It is flat when you first get it but after you use it it fluffs itself up. this item is very comfortable and I'm happy with my choice in this particular one. The down fall in this product is the feathers, in some parts of the comforter there are more feathers and others where there are hardly any. That was more noticeable when I first started using the comforter but it seemed to have evened itself out. The comforter does loose feathers with continuous use but not as much as other comforters like this usually do."
3,Not what I was looking for,"We had excellent service ordering and receiving this item. After receiving it, we were disappointed in how thin it was. It appeared to be extremely well made and warm. It appeared to be an excellent product for the price, if this is the product you are looking for. But it was so thin, we didnt see much difference between this and the typical comforter. We were looking for that effect you get from a fluffy down comforter. We returned this item and will continue looking. I wonder if there is trade offs between warmth and thread count on the one hand, and fluffyness on the other."
5,Royal Velvet Twin Down Comforter,"Bought this for my son - he loves it so much, keeps him so warm and the price was so reasonable and not crazy like some dept. stores. Item has nice gusseted sidewall. Very happy with Royal Velvet that I bought 2 more down comforters different sizes."
5,Amazing Book,"If you ever get a chance to read this book, you will find it amazing. I went on a trek in 1993 to follow up on some of the listings and I had a great time across three states. Some things have changed, of course, in the intervening years. The strange beehive structures that used to sit on public land in Arizona are no longer available to the public because someone bought that parcel and named it ""Beehive Ranch."" Still, the photos alone are worth the cost of the book..."
1,Junk,This timer is a piece of crap. Within the first week it completely malfunctioned. Delivery took three weeks. I wanted a manual mechanical timer but this one turned out to need batteries!!! Don't bother with this one.
1,Timer stopped working within 2 months,"The timer worked well for about a month. Then it stopped working: the led light flashed dimly, and the dial stopped turning. I replaced the battery, but the timer still did not work. I would never purchase this product again. Do not buy this."
2,Nice Quiet timer,"This timer was purchased for my 85 year old mother to remind her when her laundry is done. Laundry room is in the garage. She has normal hearing and poor short term memory. This alarm to be effective would have to be taped to her ear. In a quiet room from about six feet it is barely audible. With the television on, forget it. If she used it for cooking, her meals would be ruined or the smoke alarm (which is loud) would be her primary notification to take action.Cook-Rite 60-Minute Quartz Timer, White"
2,Extremely Cheap & Unreliable!,"I have trouble waking from naps, so I ordered four of these things to help train me take 20-minute naps.Nice things about them:1. No ticking noise (because it's digital)2. Long, graduated alarm notificationIt combines the ease-of-setting of an analog ""spring timer"", without some of the disadvantages that don't affect people actually using them in the kitchen.The problem is these things are extremely cheap and unreliable! I ordered four of them, set every one of them, and only two counted out time and went off. The other two consistently simply didn't work. The two that work seem to work reliably, but I'm not certain: there was an incident in which one of them may have failed to ""unwind"" as well."
1,NOT LOUD ENOUGH FOR SENIOR CITIZEN,ITEM WAS WANTED FOR TIMING MEDICATION PROCESS FOR FEET BY SENIOR CITIZEN WHO WANTED A WAKEUP IF HE FELL ASLEEP AND THE TIMER IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH TO WAKE A PERSON UP IF HE DOSES OFF DURING THE TIME OF THE MED PROCESS
2,Little sound,It works just fine. I wish I could hear it when I am a few feet away and not watching the dial.
1,DOA,"Just like other reviewers, mine was DOA. It works fine if I set it for less than 30 min, but if turned past 30 minutes, it just stays there with the red light flashing. At the price, it is not worth the hassle of exchanging for another one. I'll probably end up buying another brand at a local store."
5,"Very simple, but effective.","I use an electric espresso maker at work that does not have an auto shut-off feature. I really got tired starting the brew, then promptly forgetting about it as I get absorbed by what I am working on. I would either smell the burnt coffee and remember, or think ""I should go make some espresso"", at witch point I would remember and then smell the burnt coffee. Now I have this timer velcroed to the wall next to the espresso maker and just set it for about ten minutes as a reminder. Because it is quartz and not mechanical I don't have the ticking to bug me while I get back to work, but am also reminded in when the coffee is done."
5,Works Great,"I bought about three other ""mechanical"" timers that I threw away as soon as I got them out of the package. This Cook-Rite item is just what I wanted. It is ridiculously simple to use and the ringer is very insistent."
1,Burned 4 loaves of bread 0 stars,"I set the Cook-Rite timer for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. This was first time I had used it. I took the timer to my desk, forgot about the bread--the timer did not make a sound when the hand reached 0 minutes.Cook-Rite 60-Minute Quartz Timer, White"
1,Don't buy this,"I got this the end of june 2010, I used it less than 10 times. Then it just stopped working. I changed battery, didn't matter just didn't work. I spent $12 on it. And to return it to amazon I would have to pay for the shipping, so I didn't see the point in returning it. I don't think if a product is defective that I should have to pay for its return. I would consider myself a great customer...not sure amazon really looks after its good customers?"
2,Cheap,"The battery that comes with this product was dead when the product was first used. The timer does count down the minutes but the alarm is not in sync or it rings when it wants to. When the alarm goes off, it rings for 90 seconds. However, if you slightly touch the clock when the alarm goes off, the alarm silences without you turning it to ""off."" I'm wary to use this item to time sleep, cooking or washing clothes. It's not very reliable. Very disappointed."
2,"Good Idea, poor execution, alarm not loud enough","Everything works as it should, except the alarm is very soft and can not be heard over a moderate conversation. Thus, this thing is worthless in most kitchens with a moderate amount of noise.They should have made the alarm louder, and preferably with a volume control, if it was nothing more than some sort of door to slide over the alarm sound outlet window."
1,It doesn't time at all,"I bought this more than a year ago and it still sits on the counter, mocking me. The timer, from day-one, used to stop mid-count. Some investigation revealed that the timer always stopped at 18 minutes to zero. I opened it and cleaned and straightened the contacts and it started working, till after a few days it again stopped at the same place. More cleaning, and it worked that way for a few months. Then, it also started stopping at 8 minutes. I've given-up trying to fix it, and it's destined for the thrash can. If I open it one more time, the plastics are going to crack and it's all going to fall apart."
5,Good for the money,I set a timer when I water the yard or add water to the pool. This timer keeps beeping until I pick it up. A single ding timer ofter was not heard or forgotten. This one saves me water.
1,Never worked right,Never kept the time starting from the first time I used it. I went back to the traditional timer that makes the click noise. Originally purchased it as it was advertised as quieter.
2,Alarm sound is too weak and short,"I purchased 2 of them, one of which is not even work at all.It is very convenient to use at right next to the kitchen, and clever idea in that alarm sound is increased gradually as time goes on. The problems of this product are: alarm sound be is not loud enough at the end. It should ideally be louder and never stop the alarming."
1,Broken right out of the box,"I bought two of these timers. One gets stuck at 18 minutes every time. The other one seemed to work. But then yesterday I set it at 11 minutes, and that where it stayed, although the led light was flashing. That was after a week of use. Two out of two broken, what quality!"
1,Don't Buy It!,"This timer is a waste of time and money. It doesn't make enough sound to hear the alarm. It kept time the first time Iused it, and then it didn't work at all. Read good reviews, but believe me, it's trash. Don't buy it."
5,GREAT AND EASY TO USE,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 88 YR OLD MOTHER. HER OVEN TIMER WASN'T LOUD ENOUGH TO HEAR FROM HER LARGE FRONT ROOM. THIS WAY SHE CAN CARRY IT WITH HER ,WHEREVER SHE IS. SHE HAS MACULAR DGENERATION AND THE NUMBERS ARE VERY EASY FOR HER TO SEE. WHEREAS THE OVEN TIMER IS DIGITAL AND OFTEN NOT AS EASY TO READ."
1,Does not work,Not a good buy. It simply is not reliable. It should be taken off the market. For someone hard of hearing the little chirp is useless.
3,"When all else fails, read the instructions","Got it to work, how well do you expect for $12.10 minutes on the timer, is 12 minutes on the kitchen clockSeems you need to turn the dial clockwise to 60 minThen counter clockwise to the desired time.Faced with the choice of a Raw Dinner vs. a Burnt OfferingSome experimenting on your part is needed"
2,Broke in Seconds,"Attractive design. Numbers are clearly visible from a distance. Ringer is not loud at first, but very persistent--hard to miss.Although I was satisfied at first, the timer broke the 2nd time I used it! After closer examination, it seems as though there is a hitch somewhere near 30 minutes. It will time 10 minutes; it will even time 60 minutes, but it does not make it past the 30 minute mark. The light blinks deceptively while the hand simple does not budge past 30. Needless to say I will be writing the manufacturer a letter.If it worked right, I would like it."
1,Good idea not implemented well,"Overall this is a nice timer, with nice loud progressive alert tone, however the main function to TIME is not reliable on this unit. As a few other reviews stated, unit is unreliable or stops working. At first I though the dial was rubbing and causing the timing action to ""stick"" so using a small exacto blade opened up the dial where it rubs against the outer facia. This seemed to work -- for a few timings -- but the timer will just stop sometimes out of the blue. If the timer were reliable, it would be 5 stars, as-is has to be 1 star."
1,Not just another piece of JUNK from China.......,"Just what I had in mind, an accurate timer that did not tick. We need one that does hours......UPDATE!!!!!!!Just received my fourth timer.......I NOW give it ZERO stars !!!!!!! NOW, made in China. On first use timer failed (stuck) at the 18 minute mark of a one hour test against the other three timers. They all finished at exactly the same time. Funny they were made in the USA ????AMAZON....... we are sick of you being a party to promoting this Chinese JUNK. Get a backbone and tell your suppliers we want quality."
1,Failed After 3 Months,"I thought this timer was really great until it failed after three months of use. It was delivered about Feb. 1, 2010. We used it regularly, about once a day on average, and it was great in that it was easy to use and provided a loud, sustained alarm. Unfortunately, it just stopped working completely on April 30, 2010. I'm going to send it for warranty replacement (which, by the way, costs almost as much as buying a new one, as you have to pay postage both ways). I'll supplement this review once that process is complete."
1,I Can't Believe It,"We landed men on the moon in 1969. That was 41 years ago. And back then kitchen timers lasted years and years. This one, however, didn't even last two weeks. Our kitchen isn't a commercial kitchen, and in the nine days we had this timer, we probably used it less than 15 times. And it's broken now. Why in the world can't I find a decent kitchen timer that will last for a few years? It's very sad. If this piece of trash was made here in the U.S., then I fear for our future."
1,Disappointed!,"This timer worked OK about 4 times, then I started wondering why cooking a food item took longer than expected. It was set properly and the light was blinking but the timer arrow had moved only a few minutes. This happened twice, causing ruined meals. It can't be trusted so I returned it and will buy a better timer...I hope. The louder ring was great, when it rang. That's why the one star."
4,"Simple device, works well","This is a simple, feather-touch dial cooking timer with an electronic timing & alarm element.It is powered by a common AA battery.Just got it;Used it several times;Works darn well!Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is question of durability.It's kinda' lightweight. I wouldn't want to drop it hard.But if not mistreated, will hopefully last awhile.A heavier-duty, more-lasting, *metal* version of this timer would be ideal.But I like it so far."
5,excellent timer,"I use a timer to help keep track of music practice and other household activities. I've been disappointed with inexpensive wind-up timers - they typically stop working after anywhere from a week to a few months use, and their ticking is noisy (at least when I'm practicing music). This quartz timer from Sunbeam is about double the price of the wind-up timers, but it works like a charm. A light blinks to let you know it's working, and it's absolutely silent. Once time expires, the alert sound starts quietly and escalates if you fail to shut it off. Excellent design, a real improvement on the wind-up variety."
1,Dead on Arrival,The timer didn't work when it arrived. I returned the item and purchased another timer. I considered requesting a replacement but there are too many people who reported that this timer was broken when it arrived. I didn't want to go through the potential hassle of returning this model many times until I received one that worked.
1,Dead on arrival,"Unlike others, even the light did not work on mine. A simple piece of gear like this should not be this difficult to get right."
2,Not Happy,I purchased this timer on Amazon about one year ago and I really liked it for the long ringing time and loudness. Recently I tried to use it and now if I set it for more than 20 minutes it doesn't work properly. It gets stuck at the 20 minute mark. I had to go out and buy a new one - a Lux brand that cost as much and doesn't ring as long but I am hoping it lasts longer than this one did.
2,Didn't work right out of the box.,"Like another reviewer had noted, my dial gets stuck at about the 17-20min mark. This means that it never gets to '0' and the alarm never goes off. I'm really surprised at how many of these (this brand and others) have such bad reviews. I would recommend avoiding this one unless your willing to take a chance of getting a good one."
1,dont buy it. it doesnt work,"I ordered this to set the timer for my girls to take turns on the computer.No matter what I do, it just doesnt work. It doesnt click or have tensionwhen you turn the dial, so you can only hope you might be doing it right.I even changed the batteries several times. The dial just sits there on thesame spot all day, doesnt count down, doesnt ding. The only thing it does dois blink the little red light."
4,fifth timer purchased is finallly the right one.,"For the past two years I have been looking for a timer and have purchased four before I bought this one. Each of the previous ones had something that I did not like about them. This timer meets all of my expectations is easy to use, quiet until it needs to be loud and doesn't have a lot of unneeded features. It also cost less then some of the others I purchased but seems better made. If you want a timer that is easy to use, is accurate and a reasonable price this is the one to purchase."
2,Holy crap.,"I give this two stars only because it's historically important as a Wiccan/Neopagan foundation document. I don't know how anyone ever took Murray's ""theory"" seriously because it's so incoherent. Having read this book twice, I'm still not sure exactly what she meant to prove; her ""thesis"" only becomes clear when filtered through other authors. Murray seems to have assumed that if she kept lobbing enough ""witch trial evidence"" at readers (especially if such documents were in foreign languages), they'd believe her through sheer exhuastion. Judging by this tome, Murray would not pass a college level elementary logic course today. She would certainly never have been admitted to a basic cultural anthropology class."
1,TERRIBLE Work & Research Methods,"During years of anthropological research, I've seen this book referred to again and again. But Murray lacks any credibility. This book is a terrible source. Murray's premise is based on the records of Inquisition victims and the confessions of ""witches"" during torture and trial. One can't write seriously about this subject, and use this terrible information, extracted under duress by the Church. Murray actually postulates that the consistency of the practices described, from the confessions, is evidence of a widespread witch religion. Yes, it is evidence, but evidence pertaining to the consistant beliefs of the Papal Bull of Innocent VIII against witchcraft. Instead, aquire the worthy series of six volumes edited by Bengt Ankarloo, called ""Witchcraft and Magic in Europe."" Try works on shamanism by Wade Davis and/or Richard Evans Schultes."
4,Solid Product,"If you need to spice up your DMing a bit, give this a whirl. It has a couple of good fresh ideas that could help improve any given campaign even though the rules are dated."
2,Good for creating NPC's,"Could have been put together better , but im glad to have it in my collection."
1,What's going on here?,"This is either the worst prepared edition of a novel I have ever seen (7 errors in the first 1/2 page) or they (General Books)are operating according to some very bizarre notions--perhaps both. It's almost unreadable. No, I take that back. It gets worse as I go on--much worse. It's damned insulting and I'm thinking of asking for my money back. This appears not to be the U of Kentucky P edition."
3,Not for young kids!,"I bought this toy thinking it would be harmless, and although I know the Simpsons is a show that you would prefer your children dont imitate, I did not realize the amount of negative phrases this toy would provide. The game is fun, you do need to use memory concepts, but the phrases such as you moron, are mostly negative and I just cant see letting a young child sit down and play with this, and taking the phrases in over and over again. I'd say maybe 12 and older, although my husband said 10 and older."
2,Too hard for Me,This game is so hard. I cant even solve the first puzzle! I'm eleven soon to be twelve and I'm in all honors but this handheld game is too darn hard. Believe me if u want this game then you have to very very smart.GOOD LUCK!
5,Excellent Sunglasses,This is my second pair of Serengati Sunglasses.I wear them when I ride my motorcycle in New York City.Excellent product!
2,A True Disappointment,"My little boy loves his Justice League Superheroes, however, this toy proved to be a disappointment to us. Its durability is quite poor. Everytime he tries to put Flash in or out of the cockpit, the door comes off. Trying to separate the aircraft into two separate ones is no easy task--even for an adult. My four year old is constantly asking me to put it together and take it apart because he cannot do it himself. This toy has been truly frustrating for him and he gets so aggravated with it constantly falling apart."
4,great documentary,I saw this documentary about six months ago and it gave me a whole new understanding of what programmers have to go through. They have to put off their own lives (and their families) to finish their job.Kudos to the filmamkers
5,Code Rush is Free,"The film Code Rush has been released into the creative commons. It can be downloaded, or watched in its entirety at [...] . We hope you enjoy it.Oh and its a really good movie."
2,The Blog Fails to Download On a Daily Basis,"The blog fail to download three out of five weekdays. As a commuter, it was very annoying. I do not recommend it as a daily source of latest news."
2,Updates stopped several days ago,I thought it was great until the updates stopped. I have seen others reporting this issue. My other blogs are still being updated so I know this isn't a problem with my Kindle. I guess I will cancel.
4,"Great blog and deal, but needs a few improvement","As others have stated in their reviews, you will receive high-qualitative, well written articles / news reports everyday in a timely way from The New York Times - Lastest News. My only complaint is: you can't annotate / comment on the articles, can't share an article on FB or Twitter, can't keep the old articles (I suppose you can redeliver the old ones to your kindle?). The first two are most important for me. At least please provide a link to where the archived articles are on the Internet so that I can save them myself. I'm doing a research job, some old news articles are really a necessary resource for my work."
5,New York Times Blog - Something to look forwad to on your Kindle,"With subscriptions to my local newspaper and the number one newspaper in the state, I didn't have room in my budget for the steep cost of $20 a month for the NY Times. I decided to go with second best, the New York Times Blog, and I have not been disappointed. Twice a day, I receive a new set of the latest and varied excellent writing from the New York Times. Top world news, political news with some good reviews and features to boot. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants the NY Times but not the steep price. I am still considering the full New York Times in the future, but I agree with the reviewer who said they can't imagine cancelling this. Now if the NY Times wants to add additional stories to the 15-20 a day on its blog, I am all for it."
4,great articles but confusimg format,"the articles are exellent, but the articles are not listed in oder of publication and are not marked as read or unread, so i frequently have to go through all the articles to find the new ones kind of annoying, but i wll keep my subscription for a while yet"
2,haven't received an update in 3 days,"i liked the service, was priced well, but i haven't had the content update for over a week. canceled it."
3,A little hard to navigate,"The articles are (of course) high-quality; but the blog articles seem to be downloaded out-of-order compared to how they appear in the ""articles list"". So, when three new articles arrive, I need to fish through the entire articles list to figure out which are the new ones (no indication, I just have to remember what I've read; and often the new articles are closely related to ones I've already read).On the other hand, it's vastly cheaper than subscribing to the regular New York Times, and maybe by the time you read this, they'll have worked out the ordering issue."
5,Quick news for busy day,"The best thing about the New York Times Latest news is how much information you get in a tiny format. I am able to grab my kindle and read an article or two in the few minutes of ""down time"" I have during my office hours. During lunch, in between clients, whatever the case, I can catch up on current events. The NY Times updates itself with new articles every few hours in an easy, kindle friendly version. Skip an article, read an article, find an article all easily navigateble in this kindle format newspaper. NY Times Latest News delivers....No gossip, no opinion, no slant. Well written, concise, factual. Every day, all day rain or shine."
4,NYTIMES - Latest News,Moved over to NYTIMES after USA Today. Found this blog to be right to the point as promised. Some redundancy at times and unable to return to last page read due to ongoing additions to blog. Overall good.
4,Kindle 1 Works Great - Nook/Kindles on AT&T Problems,I just subscribed to the NY Times Blog and by the time I went into the kitchen and opened by Kindle 1 the NY Times Lastest News was downloading. For the Kindle 2 users connecting via AT&T in weak or no direct AT&T connection: I had a Barnes & Noble Nook for a couple of weeks and finally returned it. I live in a rural area where AT&T does not provide service but relies on partner connection which eliminates use of 3G connection. I could not get the Nook to connect to my encypted router even with Barnes & Noble Techs having me try multiple solutions that did not work and only made me go over $$$ my cellphone minutes. If your not getting automatic updates check your reception at the time.
1,NOT AVAILABLE ON FIRE,"OK, I love the New York Times Blog. And I really love my new Fire. Really,really,really. But I'm very disappointed that the New York Times Blog is not available on the Fire. I'm not going to buy the New York Times for the current price and I'm very happy with the format of this blog, though I miss the op-eds quite a bit. Please, get this blog on the Fire!!!"
1,Needs to be available for the Fire ASAP,"I would love to have this for the Fire and was told by Amazon support that it would be available, but nada. Extremely disappointed."
1,Can no longer save or clip stories,Since NYT began a paid service to view articles online I can now RARELY clip an article to view later or save. A message appears that the article is no longer available.Guess NYT and Amazon wants me to pay $20/month for a full subscription. I'm cancelling this blog.
3,not bad for the price,"I didn't have a lot of expectations for this blog because of it's great price, which is this product's biggest strength. My complaint though is that it often repeats articles (sometimes exact articles, that show up 2 or 3 days in a row, sometimes extremely similar articles, on the same topic, with the same objective), which dampens the diversity other reviewer's have mentioned. Like I said, for the price it isn't bad, but after my trial I won't be paying for this. If I am downloading something new daily to my Kindle, I want it to be... new. daily."
2,Good when it works!,"I will not be extending the trial period. Although the articles are well written, the updates are unreliable. It's late Sunday, and I have had no updates since Saturday morning."
5,Fantastic offering,"This blog is really a collection of articles culled from the NY Times proper. At $2 a month, this is an incredibly inexpensive way to enjoy a nice sampling of what is perhaps the finest newspaper in the country. Now if only the Wall Street Journal could offer a similar low-priced, ""sampling menu"" version of their product for the Kindle, and we'd really be in business."
5,Little Bossa Nova Showcase for a Good Price,"Just 6 pieces of great Bossa Nova releases by A&M. It's worth the price. Each track comes from a different Bossa Nova master: Antonio Carlos Jobim, Sergio Mendes, Luiz Ea's Tamba Trio/Tamba 4 and Brazilian composers Milton Nascimento and Edu Lobo - all at their best. Paul Desmond also plays 1 track from his A&M album with Brazilian musicians - a Nascimento's composition."
1,Cheap,"This is really cheaply made; I didn't expect very much for the price, but it was far less than expected."
1,do not waste your money,I bought this book as an alternative to Super baby food. What a disappointment. This book gives you recipes which are exact copies of earth's best jarred foods. Nothing new or exiciting. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money.
5,The Best Baby Food Book I Bought!,"I had planned to make my own baby food, so I bought several books on the subject. This book was by far the best one of the lot. It gives clear, concise guidelines for what foods to feed babies at different ages, done in bulleted lists that make the book very easy to read. The recipes are fairly simple and don't use alot of esoteric ingredients like many of the other baby cookbooks. Overall, this is the best laid out and most informative baby food book out there. A great buy for anyone interested in cooking their baby's food."
2,USE WITH CAUTION,"There is some confusing and questionable advice in this book. For instance, it's commonly held that babies shouldn't have cow's milk before the age of one year, yet there are many recipes in here that call for 2 cups or more of cow's milk for 6-month-olds! Also, there are recipes that call for ""brown rice"", again for six-month-olds, with no explanation as to whether they mean cooked brown rice, like Uncle Ben's, or if there's an infant brown rice cereal (I've never seen it). There are even some recipes that recommend citrus for young babies, but I've read you should wait until at least a year to introduce citrus fruits. This may be a decent recipe book for older babies, but I don't intend to use it for my beginning eater."
3,Not really what I needed,"I purchased this book because I was looking for help in making all of my son's baby food. The book doesn't really help with this, since all of the recipes are multi-ingredient, and (of course) when just starting out, you really need preparation instructions for single ingredient stuff.I decided not to keep the book even after my baby was eating mixed food because: 1) The recipes are not very inventive (it was all stuff I would've come up with on my own); 2) The book is not very easy to work with (it's small and doesn't stay open to a given page very easily); 3) There are no illustrations or other aids to help you find ideas quickly.A friend of mine brought over Super Baby Foods and I purchased that instead. I wish someone had mentioned *that* book to me before I'd bought this one - that's why I'm writing this review. If you're looking for help getting started making your own baby food, like I was, Super Baby Food is the book for you - not this one."
4,A tasty little book!,"A must have for every mom and dad to be that plan on making their own baby food! The authors, Sweet and Bloom, do a great job of presenting a large variety of recipes that are also simple and easy to follow. No searching for California parsley tops like some of the other baby recipe books. My wife and I bought this book just after our son, Zachary, was born and we both found it's information presented in a clear and understandable way. This one is recommended to anyone wanting to go through the effort of making your own...and who wouldn't want to feed that special little baby the best food possible?!!! Good luck and good cooking!"
1,Could've done better...,"I got this book for the same reasons everyone else did-to be able to provide my baby with good nutritious food in hopes of avoiding jarred baby food. I found this book to have one main problem, lots of contradictions. At first it told me what I wanted to hear, you can make baby food at home and it's easy and fulfilling. The emphasis seemed to be on providing foods that don't contain extras like sugar, butter, seasonings, etc. Then many of the recipes given contained these extras: sugar, salt, butter, and cinnamon for 10 month olds. I didn't find this very reassuring and not what I was looking for. These recipes came from chefs whom may or may not have kids so maybe that's the reason, but this was certainly not what I had in mind for my baby."
3,Readable whodunnit set in Ancient Rome,"Ovid knew where the bodies were buried in Rome and important people don't want his ""natural"" death investigated. At times a bit too musch like Carry On Romans rather than I, Claudius but very readable and smoothly written."
4,Ovid Marcus Corvinus Mystery,I enjoy the Micky Spillane type character of Marcus Corvinus in a novel about ancient Rome. Wishart in doing so makes us realize there is really nothing new in the universe. That like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple that we all know characters that remind of us somebody else we know.
2,Water or wine?,"A musically peripatetic score of ersatz Rozsa infused with gross, contemporary gimmickry that threatens to be its downfall. ""Jesus"" is interesting to hear for its magnificent main theme and righteously epic moments, but because the music rambles about until something major occurs, it never quite achieves the illustrative task of turning water to wine. Rather, this is Kool-Aid -- refreshing, but someone needs to spike the punch."
2,good design but poor quality,"i wore it several times then a chain came loose. i was able to tighten it but then the other chain came loose too and finally one of them broke. too bad, i really like the design, just wish it lasted longer!"
5,Work for a Lawn mower,Used it to replace a broken cable from a Black and Decker electric mower. Just a small modification to the mower and it fit perfectly. I didn't even border to shorten the cable. It's been 3 months and it's action is still as smooth as new. It's the cheapest way to fix a $500 mower.
2,CABLE,"Did not fit the bike I had, will try modifying cable to suite my needs should work great for bike with standard brake cables"
3,brake cable,"Seems like a sturdy, reliable cable and housing, although a little heavy. Unfortunately, it comes with fittings on both ends, one of which had to be cut off to feed through cable guides and clamp bolts."
3,"Simply a brake cable, no more, no less","Not much to say on this one, came neatly packaged and exactly as described. Good back break cable for the price."
5,Cheap set of cables that get the job done,"Just looking to replace some brake cables and/or housing on your bike. This is exactly what you need. Now I know it's not compressionless housing so you might feel a bit of flex when you really hammer down on them, but if you're not riding off road that is not going to matter. This set is perfect for replacing one line; you will need to get two for both brakes. And there is enough housing and cable for any bike. I think it's almost 5 and a half feet of it so you won't run out.Granted it's not the highest quality stuff, but I don't think it will need replacing for a few years, and at this price who could complain. Install it and forget it."
4,Came in Handy,"I have a ten speed bike and I changed out the handle bars for a more upright sitting postion. The Brake cable on the left side was way to short for the transition so I purchased a brake cable. This cable came in handy for the height of the handle bars that I got. I did have to shorten the cable, but that wasn't very hard to do. Now I have a more relaxed sitting postion on my bike and the brakes and gears work fine."
3,Needed modifications,"I had to modify this brake cable before installing it onto my son's 16"" bike.The brake lever end was fine, but I had to strip the insulation and metal housing from the brake caliper end in order to lengthen the metal cable to reach the brake caliper. This involved removing and reinstalling the metal crimp. The brakes don't work as smoothly as the previous cable, but hopefully it will get better over time."
4,"Where Is ""God Loves YOU""?","Billy Preston is certainly missed. In addition to his work with the Beatles and others, if you look at the video for the Rolling Stones' ""Hot Stuff"", you will see him all over that too. R.I.P."
4,"Billy Preston, Ultimate Collection",the epitome of funky and groovy. Roller skating would have never been as much fun without this music.
3,I Love That Song,"I bought this CD for the song ""With You I'm Born Again."" I really love that song. I recently heard the song on ""American Idol"" and Billy Preston sang it with one of the finalists. There are 20 tracks on this CD and I've heard some, but not all of them. The songs are very ""70s"" so if you don't like that kind of music, don't bother to get the CD--it will definitely take you back. If you love ""With You I'm Born Again,"" get the CD."
5,vinyl goodness abounds,I'm very impressed with the sound of the vinyl LP. I don't totally buy into the vinyl mystique but there's a warmth here that really pleases my ears. Worthwhile purchase if you're looking to add to your vinyl collection.
1,False Advertsing,The product shown in the picture is not the same product that is shipped. I have used the pictured product and like it. The product shipped is is lighter gauge. I believe this is false advertising.
4,very small and portable,"The camera is small just like the series PV-DV100. If you get tired of holding the camera so much then this is the answer, it is very light weight and it's near palm size. I will give five stars but the camera has to be a little bit bigger and the screen it's too small to see the people that it's being recorder."
2,IwAY 500c dvd,This DVD is poorly done. Not enough detail and not presented in a 'user-friendly' way. Very un-professional.
